   Michael Dukakis certified his status as the
Democratic presidential front-runner on Tuesday with a thumping 2-1
triumph over Jesse Jackson in the Pennsylvania primary. George Bush
won a resounding Republican victory and predicted the state would
deliver the final delegates needed to clinch the nomination.
   By their victories, Bush and Dukakis emerged as almost certain
opponents in the fall general election campaign _ survivors of a
campaign marathon that once featured seven Democratic candidates
and six Republicans.
   Dukakis was gaining 65 percent of the Democratic and said his
victory would be ``very very helpful'' in his quest for the White
House.
   Jackson was gaining 30 percent of the Democratic vote, and said
he intended to compete through the last primary on June 7. ``I'm a
long-distance runner,'' he said. ``It's too close now to turn
around.''
   Vice President Bush campaigned across Ohio during the day,
declaring, ``We're almost getting down to the main event. According
to the AP, this evening I'll capture enough delegates in the
Pennsylvania primary to exceed the 1,139 (Republican) convention
delegates needed for the nomination.''
   Bush was gaining 79 percent of the vote to 12 percent for
dropout Sen. Bob Dole and 9 percent for former television
evangelist Pat Robertson. President Reagan agreed to drop his
studied show of neutrality and bestow his blessings on his vice
president in a White House meeting on Wednesday.
   The GOP delegate count was far slower than the popular vote. He
needed to win 58 of the 78 delegates at stake to clinch his
majority in the Associated Press delegate count, and he seemed
certain to get them. Bush won all of the first 14 tallied, with the
rest of the races still being counted.
   Dukakis won a separate landslide in election of delegates,
leading for 165 to 12 for Jackson. One was uncommitted. That would
bring Dukakis' national delegate total to 1,266, compared to 850
for Jackson. It takes 2,081 to clinch nomination.
   Network polling place interviews contained news that was as good
for Dukakis as his vote totals.
   Though Jackson gained more than 90 percent support from blacks,
ABC polling analyst Doug Muzzio said that for the first time in the
campaign season, Dukakis was winning a majority of voters who cited
the poor and elderly as their chief concerns _ voters Jackson won
in prior contests. He said Dukakis also was winning voters who
cited strong leadership and ability to make a change, groups that
Jackson usually won in earlier races.
   ``He's emerging as the consensus candidate,'' pollster I.A.
Lewis of the Los Angeles Times said of Dukakis. ``The next step is
going to be binding the wounds, pulling the party together and
getting it directed against the Republicans.''
   Dukakis was cautious, as ever.
   Asked if the big win meant the nomination is now his, Dukakis
refused to claim the crown yet, refering to Democratic nominee
Walter Mondale's problems in 1984.
   ``I reminded you several time that Fritz Mondale won New York
and Pennsylvania and then lost a string of primaries,'' he said.
   Bush achieved his status as odds-on favorite to win the
nomination far faster than Dukakis, routing the Republican eld on a
single Super Tuesday on March 8. Dukakis gained the upper hand week
by week. Even so, both men fared better than seemed possible when
the nominating wars opened in Iowa last February _ and both men
wound up third in the state's lead-off caucuses.
   On Tuesday, both Bush and Dukakis already were pointing their
campaigns toward the fall.
   With 73 percent of the Pennsylvania vote in, the Democratic vote
was:
   Dukakis, 745,930, or 65 percent.
   Jackson, 344,284, 30 percent.
   On the Republican side, it was:
   Bush, 447,504, 79 percent.
   Dole, 68,402, 12 percent.
   Robertson, 53,166, 9 percent.
   Dukakis said his Pennsylvania victory was a ``very big boost ...
particularly in a state that has been a bellwether state in the
general election.''
   He said he would ``campaign as hard as I can'' in the remaining
primaries.
   Jackson made clear he has the same intentions. ``The contest
will be determined on June 7 in California and New Jersey,'' he
said from Ohio, which holds one of three primaries on next week's
calendar.
   ``We have every reason to be hopeful, if we keep winning every
urban center. Our coalition is broad, it is strong, it is deep, and
we're inspired to run on.''
   The outline of Bush's campaign against Dukakis was taking shape.
The vice president said the Democratic front-runner lacks foreign
policy experience and added, ``That will be a major issue in the
fall.''
   The vice president also arranged to meet Wednesday with
President Reagan. Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan ``will see
him first thing in the morning, and I am sure the president will
offer his congratulations and discuss how he can help in the
campaign.''
   On the Democratic side, Dukakis was scarcely more than halfway
toward a nominating majority, but party officials were beginning to
talk aloud about a first-ballot victory for the man from
Massachusetts.
   Larryann Willis, an uncommitted superdelegate from Oregon, said,
``If the voting goes the way it's going (in upcoming primaries),
Dukakis will get it (the nomination) on the first ballot.''
   James Ruvolo, Ohio Democratic chairman, agreed that Dukakis
enters his state with campaign momentum. ``What I worry about is
Washington insiders trying to end the race before it's over,'' he
said.
   Philadelphia Mayor Wilson Goode had this advice for Jackson:
``hang in there.''
   Dukakis forged his early Pennsylvania lead after a week-long
campaign that looked and sounded more like a mutual admiration
society than the typical 1988 Democratic primary brawl.
   Jackson had scant hopes for a victory in Pennsylvania, where his
campaign failed to file a complete slate of delegate candidates. He
already was looking ahead to next week's primaries in the District
of Columbia, Indiana and Ohio.

<HEAD>Ethics Panel Clears Couple At HHS Of Taking Unauthorized Trips</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A government review panel has cleared a
married couple at the Department of Health and Human Services of
violating federal travel rules or taking unauthorized trips at
government expense, according to a published report Wednesday.
   The department's ethics review board found that the trips by
Terry and Paget Hinch had been authorized and did involve
government business, The Washington Post reported.
   The panel said in a written report that Mrs. Hinch apparently
had arranged three legitimate business trips so that she could be
near her husband at the resort area of Orlando, Fla., and over
Thanksgiving near his family's home in the San Franciso area.
   The board said arranging the trips for ``the personal
convenience of the Hinches'' raised an ``appearance of
impropriety,'' and noted that it had sought and received voluntary
reimbursement of $3,264 for some costs related to the trips.
   However, the report added, ``The board does not believe that any
disciplinary action is warranted by the evidence relating to the
official travel by Terry and Paget Hinch.''

   Emperor Hirohito held a rare news conference to
talk of his health and his fabled past as the world's
longest-reigning monarch.
   The annual news conference, to be broadcast Friday on his 87th
birthday, came as some Japanese already were preparing for the
death of the emperor, who has been on the throne since Dec. 25,
1926.
   Medical equipment has been moved from a hospital on palace
grounds into Hirohito's living quarters so he can die at home, said
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   However, they said, there was no indication his health is
failing.
   At Monday's news conference for 30 Japanese reporters, Hirohito
talked of World War II and its aftermath, said the sources. It has
been 13 years since his last news conference with foreign
reporters, when he denied planning the attack on Pearl Harbor but
left many other questions unanswered.

   British producer David Puttnam, bidding
farewell to Hollywood after a stormy two years, has offered a
sobering view of America.
   ``There is a disillusionment wafting through the heady winds of
the American dream as more and more people come to feel that
they've had the experience but somehow, somewhere, missed out on
the meaning of it,'' Puttnam said Saturday in a speech to the 34th
annual Entertainment Law Symposium at the University of Southern
California.
   The movie-industry maverick rode into Hollywood on the
reputation of his successful ``Chariots of Fire,'' but his job as
chairman of Columbia Pictures went up in smoke 14 months later.
   During his tenure at Columbia, Puttnam had fallouts with many
stars, agents and such filmmakers as influential producer Ray
Stark. Puttnam argued that successful films can be made without
highly paid actors and directors.

   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter
joked that he probably was the subject of the first and last ``Meet
the Press'' appearance from Nebraska.
   Yeutter appeared on the NBC program Sunday via a satellite
hookup from Lincoln to present the administration's opposition to
the trade bill in Congress.
   Midway through Yeutter's first answer, the satellite feed broke
up and for the rest of the show the program's panelists could
direct questions only to Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, the show's
other guest and a key supporter of the legislation.
   ``It was frustrating, sitting there in that little studio in
Lincoln, Nebraska, having to watch and listen to that biased
explanation of the plant closing amendment,'' Yeutter said.
   ``That was probably the first time in history that they have
ever done a `Meet the Press' feed out of Nebraska and probably the
last time in history they will do one,'' Yeutter joked Monday
during an appearance before farm editors.

   After watching Mary Lou Retton pitch practically
everything from batteries to breakfast cereal, Olympic teammate
Greg Louganis has one thing to tell the gymnast: I'd love to have
your problems.
   ``I saw Mary Lou Retton on Ted Koppel's (ABC's) `Nightline'
recently, and she was complaining that she wasn't prepared to be
thrust into the limelight after the '84 Olympics,'' Louganis told
Gentleman's Quarterly magazine in its May issue.
   ``I don't feel sorry for her. She's made $5 million! Give me her
problems, please!'' the gold-medal-winning diver said.
   Louganis also revealed that although he appears confident and in
command on the diving platform, ``I'm not in control of my diving.''
   ``I get disoriented in a dive and lose the water. It's
terrifying,'' he said. ``Diving has been my only distinction in
life, but I'm not afraid to leave it.''

   Actor James Garner is continuing his recovery
from quintuple bypass heart surgery, eating his first solid food in
a hospital room overflowing with cards and flowers, a spokesman
said.
   Garner's popularity with his fans, and now with the Cedars-Sinai
staff, is unparalleled, said hospital spokesman Ron Wise,
describing the bags of mail and gardens of flowers sent by
well-wishers.
   Asked if the spokesman for the beef industry's $30 million
``Beef, Real Food for Real People'' ad campaign was eating meat,
Wise said, ``I don't know what he's eating.''
   Garner, 60, earlier blamed his heart problem on 45 years of
cigarette smoking.

   An American Express Co. stockholder says
he believes former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and other
big-name directors and consultants at the company don't deserve
their hefty pay.
   Kissinger's consulting firm pocketed $420,000 in fees last year
in addition to his $48,000 salary as an American Express director,
stockholder Benedict Toth of Coral Gables said Monday at the
company's annual meeting here.
   But Chairman James D. Robinson III said Kissinger's contacts
have proven valuable.
   Kissinger brought $508 million in capital to the company last
year and helped lure Japanese investors, Robinson said. That led to
Nippon Life Insurance Co. of Japan buying a 13 percent voting
interest in Shearson Lehman Hutton, American Express' brokerage
arm, he said.
   Other directors or consultants at the meeting were former
President Gerald Ford, former Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis
and former National Urban League President Vernon E. Jordan Jr.

   From 1975 to this March, 226,091
Vietnamese boat people have landed in Malaysia, an official said
today.
   The influx of Vietnamese refugees began in 1975 after U.S.
forces withdrew from South Vietnam and it fell to communist forces
from North Vietnam.
   Of the 226,091 refugees, 217,812 resettled in other countries,
including 128,000 in the United States, said Eric E. Morris, the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for Malaysia and
Brunei.
   In the first three months of this year, 2,921 boat people
reached Malaysian shores, higher than the 1,702 for the same period
last year, he said.
   Morris told reporters the increase was due, in part, to
Thailand's decision to forbid boats of refugees to land on its
shores.
   The boat people generally land on the east coasts of Malaysia
and Thailand by cutting across the South China Sea.

   Salim Shaar always liked
fixing things. He spent the last afternoon of his life laying new
tiles on the family porch and wiring new lights.
   He planned to finish the job the next day, after a morning of
throwing stones at Israeli soldiers. But a soldier thought he saw a
firebomb in Salim's hand, and the next time Salim crossed the porch
he was carried, with a bullet hole in his head.
   On an afternoon two weeks later, members of the family sat at
home sipping strong Arab coffee and talking about the shy,
23-year-old electrician, Bethlehem's first martyr of the Arab
rebellion that began nearly five months ago in the Israeli-occupied
lands.
   ``This uprising changes everyone,'' said Salim's father, Khalil.
``It turns a sane man into a crazy man. It turns a shy man into an
angry man.''
   The clearest evidence of the change in Salim is in his diary, a
frayed notepad from a souvenir shop lovingly preserved by his
family. It speaks of his growing desperation.
   ``I don't dream about toys anymore, mother,'' Salim wrote in an
entry directed to his mother, Fatmah, several weeks before his
death. ``When they killed my friends I grew up a thousand years.''
   When the violence began Dec. 8, Salim was a good-natured young
man devoted to his job, who often stopped at the homes of neighbors
after work to see if anything needed fixing, his family says.
   ``People appreciated him, and his work made him happy,'' said
his brother Mohammed, 21. ``He didn't have any great ambitions.''
   Salim was happy at his family's home, and had added a room to it
where he could settle one day with a wife. He filled the new
closets with books on electricity, and moved into the room only
weeks before he died.
   His possessions do not seem those of a man driven to die for a
cause. They reveal instead a young man who liked music _ Turkish
singers and traditional Arab tunes _ and was an amateur
photographer who filling albums with pictures of his friends.
   Friends and family said Salim began to change when the
``intefadah,'' Arabic for uprising, came to the towns and refugee
camps near Bethlehem, taking the lives of young Palestinians like
himself.
   ``Salim was affected by what was going on,'' said a cousin,
Mussa. ``He had many friends who went to prison and it became
obvious to him that one day he, too, would go to jail. So he wanted
to prepare himself.''
   He began spending free time at the nearby Dheishe refugee camp,
talking to Palestinians who had been in jail and visiting the
families of prisoners to offer emotional support.
   In the diary, Salim sounds alternately desperate and defiant.
   ``What's a human being worth without a homeland, without a flag,
without an address?'' he wrote, and later: ``The enemy planes can
raid our camps and kill our children, but cannot kill our will to
fight.''
   The entry for Friday, April 1, the night before his death, was
the most striking: ``If my friends come back without me, mother,
don't cry. Every tear in your eyes is oil to light a lamp of
freedom.''
   Salim was in a good mood that Saturday morning, his family said.
He took a shower, donned khaki trousers and a sweater, kissed his
mother and said: ``If I come back, I won't be late.''
   He and his brother, Mohammed, set off to join friends in
Bethlehem's market, gathering stones along the way. They became
part of a group in central Manger Square, where Israeli soldiers
were stationed.
   ``When it's over, you go back home. I'll go to a friend's
house,'' Salim told Mohammed, anticipating the house-to-house
search that often followed protests.
   According to the army account of the morning's events, a soldier
thought he saw a firebomb in Salim's hand, but the family called
that ``absurd.'' What no-one disputes is that Salim was killed
instantly by a bullet that went through his right cheek and out the
back of his neck.
   His parents, still in mourning clothes two weeks later, became
defiant in their grief when asked if they would stop their seven
other children from joining protests.
   ``We all have the right to demonstrate for what we believe in,''
Fatmah said. ``I will never take that from my children.''
   Khalil nodded and added: ``Besides, Salim is not really dead. He
lives on as a hero for our town.''

   Commander Halcon and his band of
Nicaraguan rebels move freely around what they call their
``liberated zone'' in the jungles near the Caribbean coast.
   They are willing to talk peace but won't lay down their arms.
   ``We have received orders from our high command to stop
shooting,'' Halcon said as he sat under a tree while his men rested
nearby. ``But we are not dropping our guard. The enemy cannot be
trusted.''
   A peasant widow provided food and coffee to his company of young
rebels, including several women.
   Halcon, a former Sandinista who fought against the National
Guard of late strongman President Anastasio Somoza, and his troops
are in the jungles of Southern Zelaya province near the Caribbean
coast.
   They are part of the Southern Front of the Democratic Nicarguan
Force, or FDN, the main Contra force which has fought to overthrow
the Sandinista government.
   The area is one of seven set up under a 60-day cease-fire
agreement between the U.S.-backed Contras and the Sandinista.
   Under the agreement, the Sandinistas have promised not to attack
Contra troops congregating in the areas.
   ``They don't come here anyway,'' Halcon said. ``We liberated
this zone a long time ago.''
   Looking around at his troops, Halcon said, ``There is no one
here among us against his will.''
   ``The people know we are not mercenaries,'' he said.
   Journalists traveled with the group for a day, visiting
different camps where they met groups of rebels. Halcon said he
commands three companies of 100 men each in the rugged eastern zone.
   Sandinista army troops evacuated many of the residents from the
mountainous region two years ago in an effort to remove the rebels'
``social base'' but some people refused to leave.
   They often help the Contras and provide food. They do the same
for the Sandinista army when it moves in.
   Some cattle still roam the area and Contra groups use abandoned
farms.
   Halcon and his men appeared to be well-armed and in good
spirits. They had enough medicine and beef and plenty of U.S.-made
candy to eat. At night they danced to tapes of Mexican ``ranchera''
music, then slept in hammocks made of silky parachute cloth.
   The commander said the last air drop of U.S. supplies to the
group came a month ago.
   Under the cease-fire that took effect April 1, rebels may
receive humanitarian aid through neutral international
organizations once they are settled in the designated zones.
   Details of the truce are still being worked out in talks which
will resume Thursday.
   Halcon said he had received two letters from the regional
commander of the Sandinista army asking him to meet with the
government represntatives ``in an effort to achieve peace.''
   He said he was waiting for further instructions from Contra
headquarters. There have already been several meetings of army and
rebel groups on the field since the cease-fire went into effect.
   ``We will do whatever our leaders tell us,'' Halcon said. ``If
we had a complete cease-fire, it would be the most beautiful thing.
We have been fighting among Nicaraguans for too long. But we are
armed campesinos and we are willing to fight ... and we are not
going to lay down our arms unless there is a definitive
cease-fire.''
   ``We will lay down our arms when the Sandinistas lay down
theirs, when there is a democratic government in Nicaragua.''

<HEAD>Police Crack Down On Manila's Red Light District</HEAD>

   The police chief is vowing to close
down Manila's honky-tonk district, which he claims had made it the
``Sin Capital of Asia.''
   His targets are nightspots in the neighborhood known as the
city's ``tourist belt,'' where scantily clad girls bump and grind
to disco music and _ for a price _ go out with male customers.
   Although the Ermita district pumps millions of dollars each year
into the city's economy, authorities have called for replacing the
nightspots with more wholesome family entertainment.
   ``Now, we are known internationally as the center of the flesh
trade, the Sin City of Asia,'' Brig. Gen. Alfredo Lim, the
capital's police chief, said recently. ``When we hear of this
reference, all of us feel a furious sense of outrage, for we all
know that we don't deserve such notoriety.''
   However, bar owners say the crackdown will cause worse problems,
add to economic hardship and advance the spread of sexual disease.
   Last month, police began raiding bars and discos in the city's
Ermita district. They have rounded up more than 2,000 barmaids,
known as ``hospitality girls,'' and detained dozens of foreigners
who operate some of more than 505 bars, restaurants, discos,
nightclubs and brothels in Ermita's 10-block strip.
   President Corazon Aquino has backed the raids, saying ``what we
should guard against is sacrificing the dignity and honor of the
Filipino woman.''
   But in a country with many economic problems, sex is big
business.
   Lim said he expects bar owners _ mostly Americans, Australians,
West Germans, Japanese and Filipinos _ to fight back by waging a
smear campaign against him and his police force.
   ``They are employing all tricks to stop us so they can earn
bundles and bundles of money,'' Lim said. ``They are capitalizing
on our women.''
   Indeed, an typical Ermita bar earns about $715 dollars on a
regular day. The bigger establishments average about $1,666 daily.
   But Gilbert Compuesto, general manager of the Hollywood Show
Palace, said the raids have been hurting the once-thriving
entertainment industry, cutting daily earnings by as much as 70
percent.
   Moreover, Ronnie Rueda, operations manager of a leading club
called Firehouse, said closing bars will force tens of thousands of
Manila prostitutes to go underground. She says that will make it
difficult to trace carriers of acquired immune deficiency syndrome
and venereal diseases.
   Lim said 80 percent of 2,000 women picked up in the raids have
been found suffering from venereal disease. The Department of
Health said at least 50 Filipinos, mostly hospitality girls, have
been infected with the AIDS virus, but none has developed its
active symptoms.
   ``The problem of venereal disease will spread out because the
women will become freelancers. They will hang around hotels and
restaurants,'' Rueda said. ``Who will manage them and check them
for diseases?''
   Compuesto said his group has offered to help police by closing
some establishments and ridding the area of free-lance prostitutes.
But he says their offer has been ignored.
   ``If they are really trying to cure the problem of morality,
this campaign should be nationwide,'' Compuesto said. ``How can
they solve immorality, prostitution or drug abuse if they are only
concentrating on Ermita?''
   Other critics say closing Ermita's seedy establishments would
force some displaced workers into a life of crime. ``If you're
starving and you're the only breadwinner in the family, I think
there is nothing else to do,'' said Kit Samson, a disc jockey.
   Compuesto said most bar girls are earning more than the $3
minimum daily wage of factory workers, not counting what they earn
once they leave the bars with customers.
   ``Thousands of people don't have jobs. We have jobs that we
enjoy, but now they want to get it from us,'' Compuesto said.
``What kind of logic is that?''
   ``It's really a hypocrisy of people to say that when tourists
come to the Philippines, they just want to see the sights in
Tagaytay, Baguio or some other part of the country,'' Compuesto
said. ``They need entertainment.''

<HEAD>Court Takes Own Initiative And Reopens Civil Rights Ruling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Civil rights groups are worried that a Supreme
Court decision to reconsider a 12-year-old ruling on race
discrimination could be the beginning of an effort to reverse basic
legal advances for minorities.
   Conservatives see it as signaling the possible end of an era
where they believe legal principles were bent to favor minorities.
   ``The message is there's a new court now that Justice (Anthony
M.) Kennedy is on board and previous rulings are up for grabs,''
said Ira Glasser, executive director of the American Civil
Liberties Union. ``It is an ominous development.''
   By a 5-4 vote Monday, the justices took the unusual initiative
of broadening the scope of a North Carolina racial-harassment case
so that they could consider limiting the ability of minorities to
sue private citizens for monetary damages.
   Arthur Spitzer, the ACLU's legal director here, said the court's
action will have ``enormous psychological impact'' by indicating
``basic civil rights decisions now may be considered open to
attack.''
   A conservative constitutional lawyer, hailing the action, said
it comes from a court ``no longer willing to say, as it has in the
past, that any statutory interpretation that is a victory for
minorities automatically wins even if you've got to bend legal
principles.''
   The lawyer, Bruce Fein, visiting fellow in constitutional
studies at the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation, said
the action could lead the court to take another look at other cases
which represent ``really almost absurd efforts to rewrite intent
and legislative history.''
   ``This indicates to me,'' Fein said, ``that the court is going
to take a hard look at statutory civil rights and be willing to
overturn decisions where they were based on really flawed
reasoning, even if the results are politically unpopular.''
   Kennedy, who joined the court in February, provided a fifth vote
Monday to re-examine the 1976 ruling that expanded the right of
minorities to sue over alleged discrimination.
   The other four are Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White, Antonin Scalia and Sandra Day O'Connor.
Scalia, O'Connor and Kennedy were appointed to the court by
President Reagan, a frequent critic of rulings he regards as too
liberal.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, in a sharply worded dissent, said
minorities may feel betrayed by the court's willingness to consider
discarding an important civil rights precedent.
   He said the action is unwise activism and will ``have a
detrimental and enduring impact on the public's perception of the
court as an impartial adjudicator.''
   He was joined by Justices William J. Brennan, Harry A. Blackmun
and Thurgood Marshall.
   Their views were echoed by Glasser, who said the five in the
majority ``have made careers of extolling the virtue of judicial
restraint.''
   Glasser continued, ``In this case they have reopened a major
strand of the civil rights enforcement infrastructure when neither
party in the case has asked to do so and when there is no ferment
in the courts below.''
   The court majority, in an unsigned order, said, ``It is surely
no affront to settled jurisprudence to request argument on whether
a particular precedent should be modified or overruled.''
   The North Carolina case, argued last Feb. 29, now will be held
over until the court's next term beginning in October. A ruling is
likely in 1989.
   In the case, Brenda Patterson, a black woman, wants to use a
post-Civil War law to force her employer, McClean Credit Union, to
pay actual and punitive damages for alleged harassment.
   Lower federal courts said the law, the Civil Rights Act of 1866,
is designed only to ban racial discrimination in hiring, firing and
promotion _ not racial harassment.
   Ms. Patterson still could charge racial harassment under a 1964
civil rights law. But the more recent law provides that those who
win their cases in court may collect back pay, not potentially big
awards as compensation for emotional and mental suffering.
   Civil rights groups say the more limited 1964 law may not be a
sufficient deterrent to harassment.
   The court agreed to use Ms. Patterson's appeal to reconsider a
1976 ruling, called Runyon vs. McCrary, that held that racially
segregated private schools violate the 1866 law. The statute was
enacted to ensure that recently freed slaves would enjoy all the
rights of citizenship.
   The 1976 decision has given civil rights groups an important
legal weapon to fight racial bias by permitting them to use the law
as a basis for lawsuits against private individuals.
   In other action, the court:
   _Turned away the first ``dial-a-porn'' case ever to reach it,
letting stand a ban on sexually explicit telephone message services
in Arizona.
   _Agreed to decide whether wardens of federal prisons should have
sweeping power to say what publications inmates may read.

<HEAD>Reagan Administration Reversing Field on Extent of U.S. Role in
Gulf</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   New declarations that the United States
doesn't want a ``serious shooting war'' with Iran come amid signs
that the Reagan administration is backing away from earlier
proposals to broaden the U.S. role in the Persian Gulf.
   The new suggestions by top administration officials come after a
week-long review of Persian Gulf policy triggered by the April 18
clash between the Navy and Iran, in which six Iranian ships were
damaged or sunk.
   Last week, U.S. officials had said the policy was under review,
specifically the rules of engagement which permitted the Navy only
to protect itself and 11 reflagged Kuwaiti tankers.
   But on Monday, administration officials suggested that there may
be no change in that policy. Secretary of State George Shultz
stressed that no final decision had been made, but said ``we will
not get tied up in any serious shooting war with the Iranians.''
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater reflected the new line,
telling reporters that ``everybody acknowledges that we need to
move back to some more limited set of rules.''
   For the past 10 months, Navy ships have been escorting the 11
reflagged Kuwaiti tankers through the gulf, which is one of the
venues for the long Iran-Iraq war. Kuwait is an ally of Iraq.
   The United States has previously attacked Iranian forces and
facilities in retaliation for Iranian mine-laying activities. Last
week's clash was in revenge for an April 14 incident in which a
Navy frigate hit a mine the United States claimed was laid by Iran.
   Administration officials had suggested last week that the rules
might be changed to let the Navy aid other merchant ships should
those vessels come under attack.
   ``Right now the rules of engagement are essentially the same as
they were last week, reflecting the emergency nature of the
situation,'' Fitzwater said Monday. ``But the question is, where do
we move back to? ... I can't discuss specifics.''
   Shultz, appearing on NBC's ``Today'' program from Belgium where
he was meeting with other NATO officials, said ``as far as our
rules of engagement are concerned, what the right ones are for this
stage of the game in the gulf is being considered in Washington,
and there is a process of consultation going on, and I think it's
premature to describe them in any particular way.''
   On April 18, Fitzwater said, Navy vessels were given wider
latitude. ``You'll recall at that point that our ships were
engaging hostile forces in any number of areas. And we now want to
move back to our conservative set of rules. And so that decision
has to be made about where to move back to...''
   One change may be the addition of up to six 110-foot Coast Guard
boats to help patrol the shallow gulf waters.
   That proposal was criticized on Capitol Hill, where senators
noted that the Coast Guard is already cutting back its anti-drug
patrols and some routine search and rescue missions because of
budget cuts. But the Navy has offered to pay for the Coast Guard's
Persian Gulf patrols.
   ``Ridiculous, harebrained, absolute utter nonsense,'' said Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., a critic of administration anti-drug
policies.
   Sen. Mark Hatfield of Oregon, ranking Republican on the Senate
Appropriations Committee, said, ``I don't know what the rationale
for that would be. We've put a lot of additional burdens on the
Coast Guard in the last few years and I'd think they have a full
plate.''
   The committee will meet later this week to consider shifting
money to the Coast Guard to meet a $100 million budget shortfall.
   The lightly armed ``Island'' class patrol boats would be pulled
off anti-drug patrols in the Caribbean, Coast Guard officials said
Monday. The boats would be replaced by new Coast Guard cutters now
under construction.
   Adm. Paul A. Yost, commandant of the Coast Guard, said ``if the
president, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, think those boats would be
a help over there, I'm more than delighted to send them and my
Coast Guard personnel are ready to go. Really raring and ready to
go.''
   The Coast Guard is part of the Transportation Department, but
the agency also falls under Defense Department jurisdiction for
national security purposes.
   The boats which would be used in the gulf operations have a
maximum speed of more than 26 knots and carry a crew of 16. The
vessels are armed with one 20mm machine gun in the front, and two
7.62mm machine guns elsewhere. Another 20mm machine gun can be
added.

<TEXT>
   A teen-ager walking barefoot along
a busy street was electrocuted when she stepped on a steel plate
that covered wiring for a light post, authorities said.
   Sunday morning's accident that killed 17-year-old Veronika
Beatriz Feria ``was just a death waiting to happen,'' said Ott
Cefkin, a Fort Lauderdale police spokesman.
   The street and wiring had been moved to make way for the
entrance of a new shopping center. It was badly rewired and set the
grating alive with 480 volts, said police and a Florida Power and
Light spokesman.
   Had the victim been wearing shoes, she probably would have been
insulated from the current, said FPL spokesman Don Ostberg.
   Feria, who moved to Oakland Park from Peru, had been celebrating
the 18th birthday of her best friend, Lina Torres, on Saturday.
They had gone to the beach with another friend, Beatriz
Lopez-Aguirre, 29, and were on their way to her apartment shortly
before 5 a.m.
   Feria's friends received mild shocks when they tried in vain to
revive her.
   A motorist, Michael A. Spector, stopped to help and pulled her
body off the plate using a towel for insulation, authorities said.
   Cefkin said city workers investigating the accident told police
a poorly insulated wire had been improperly positioned on the lip
of the box beneath the steel plate. When the lid was placed on the
box, the insulation was severed.
   ``It turned that cover into a hot plate,'' Cefkin said.
   Ostberg said he'd never heard of that happening.
   Cefkin said it was unclear who was responsible for the wiring,
but the investigation was continuing.

   Imagine it: newspaper stories next year that
begin with the words, ``Vice President and Secretary of Defense Sam
Nunn said today that ...''
   There would be a lot of ifs to be surmounted if Georgia's senior
Democratic senator were in a position to assume such a jawbreaking
and unprecedented dual title.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis would have to win the
Democratic presidential nomination, ask Nunn to be his running
mate, offer him the Pentagon as an inducement to accept, and then
win the fall campaign.
   But the idea is being floated _ apparently seriously _ by such
leading Democrats as former Virginia Gov. Charles Robb.
   Others say Nunn as a prominent Southerner and respected defense
expert would so strengthen a Dukakis ticket that he should be
promised he could be secretary of state or national security
adviser _ if he also agrees to run for vice president.
   Nunn has said that no matter what inducements might be offered,
his interest in the vice presidency is just about one on a scale of
10.
   But he has never said never.
   No vice president has ever served simultaneously as secretary of
defense.
   No vice president has ever served simultaneously as a member of
a president's Cabinet.
   But a number of people who became vice president had previously
served in presidential cabinets.
   John C. Calhoun served as vice president in one period and as
secretary of state at another.
   Presidents have appointed vice presidents to task forces on one
subject or another.
   President Reagan named Vice President George Bush to head a task
force on drugs and narcotics. President John F. Kennedy named his
vice president, Lyndon B. Johnson, to head a task force on space
exploration.
   Other vice presidents have had a strong influence on their
administrations. But that has been the rare exception rather than
the rule.
   While not barred by the Constitution, a vice president
simultaneously serving as secretary of defense might well discover
a thicket of unexpected conflicts.
   While the vice president has his job by election, a cabinet
officer must be confirmed by the Senate.
   The only job specifically assigned the vice president by the
Constitution is to serve as president of the Senate.
   Unexpected strains might arise if the Senate were asked to
confirm its own presiding office to serve as well in a Cabinet post.
   In the role of the Senate's presiding officer, the vice
president's only real power is his ability to cast tie-breaking
votes at moments of legislative impasse.
   Some senators might demand that a vice president who was also
the secretary of defense abstain from breaking a tie on closely
divided defense issues directly affecting his department.
   Such a decision would deprive the administration of its ability
to decide the issue in its favor by breaking the tie.
   Since 1981 Bush has broken seven ties, five of them on defense
issues.
   Secretaries of defense routinely testify before congressional
committees in defense of military budgets. There is some potential
awkwardness in a situation when the witness is also president of
the Senate.
   Concern might also be triggered if it became necessary for an
elected vice president also serving as secretary of defense to
travel with a president to an overseas conference.
   That would place both the president and vice president out of
the country at the same time. And that might become a more
worrisome situation if the country they were visiting were the
Soviet Union.
   Naming Nunn the national security adviser might create fewer
such problems since the person who fills that post is not confirmed
by the Senate.
   The vice presidency has not always been a happy post for the
person who held the job. Many have complained it consists of little
more than attending the funerals of foreign leaders.
   John Adams, the nation's first vice president, had some thoughts
on his job which he shared with his colleagues on the eve of a
visit to their chamber by President Washington.
   ``Gentlemen, I feel great difficulty (in) how to act,'' Adams
said.
   ``I am possessed of two separate powers. I am vice president. In
this I am nothing, but I may be everything.
   ``But I am president also of the Senate. When the president
comes into the Senate, what shall I be?''
   Some politicians are still thinking about what a vice president
shall be, at least when Sam Nunn's name comes up for discussion.

   Soviet officials are giving up hopes of sharp
cuts in strategic nuclear arsenals before President Reagan leaves
office and fear he may be returning to Red-baiting as he prepares
to make his exit.
   ``The problem is that the American position is moving not
forward but backward,'' said Valentin Falin, chairman of the
semi-official Novosti news agency.
   ``As far as I can see, we don't have enough time to prepare any
formal treaty'' before the Moscow summit May 29-June 2, Falin said
in an interview on Monday.
   Falin, a non-voting member of the policymaking Soviet Central
Committee and former Soviet ambassador to West Germany, blamed the
Reagan administration and the U.S. political process for what he
called wasted time since the summit in Washington last December.
   ``Certainly we cannot accomplish in the following four weeks
what we have failed to do in four months,'' said Falin.
``Certainly, we cannot expect miracles.''
   Falin also criticized a U.S. intelligence report saying the
Soviet economy has not improved despite economic reforms by Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   He said the joint report by the Central Intelligence Agency and
Pentagon analysts might have been done ``to show the president that
the Soviet Union is almost on its deathbed and it needs just
another push, that he should not talk with the Soviet Union, but
push it.''
   Falin contested the pessimistic U.S. intelligence report, and
said that under Gorbachev industrial production rose more than 4
percent last year and agricultural production was up 9 percent,
``higher than any rate in a decade.''
   The U.S. intelligence studies said the production of goods and
services last year in the Soviet Union grew by only 0.5 percent,
after a 4 percent jump in 1986.
   Falin said the gloomy U.S. intelligence report and recent
speeches by the president may signal a return to the harsh
anti-Soviet rhetoric of Reagan's first years in office, when he
called the Soviet Union an ``evil empire.''
   ``I would say that in his most recent speech, as well as his
speeches in March and February, the president was preoccupied with
rhetoric,'' said Falin. ``Bearing in mind that he will not remain
in office for a long time, he is trying to say in his last speeches
what he lost the chance to say in 1981 and 1982.
   ``We have already passed the time when we could tolerate such
rhetorical escapades.''
   Gorbachev complained after meeting with Secretary of State
George P. Shultz in Moscow last week that the administration was
``marking time'' in arms control negotiations.
   Reagan has said that he will not tailor his arms control
positions to meet political deadlines, and does not expect the
meeting in Moscow to wrap up the proposed Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty to cut strategic nuclear arsenals by 30 to 50 percent.
   Previously, Soviet officials were more optimistic in public
assessments of the summit. Falin's comments reflected what has
become public pessimism by the Kremlin.
   Falin also accused the Reagan administration of dragging its
heels in negotiations for an international convention to curb
chemical weapons and on Warsaw Pact proposals for cuts in
non-nuclear forces in Europe.
   But whatever the prospects for the summit, said Falin, Reagan
``will be accorded our very warm and very deep hospitalities.''
   ``As we look at summits, we think they are convened not to
express sentiments, but to become milestones in the development of
bilateral and international relations,'' said Falin. ``This is a
problem for the president, because it is important for him how he
finishes his political career.''
   At best, said Falin, the meeting may produce a ``framework ...
for the development of future negotiations. This will make
negotiations easier.''
   But no START accord is likely by the end of the year, and it is
doubtful that Reagan and Gorbachev would meet again for what would
be their fifth summit, he said.
   After Moscow, said Falin, ``I do not think that your president
will have enough authority to make obligations which would have to
be fulfilled by his successor.''
   The Soviets, he said, are frustrated by the American political
process.
   ``In your country, it is a dead political season,'' said Falin.
``Every four years in your political life, one year is wasted.''
   He declined to say whether the Kremlin would prefer to deal with
Vice President George Bush, who has virtually clinched the
Republican presidential nomination, or with the Democratic
front-runner, Michael Dukakis.
   ``The Soviet leadership would prefer to negotiate with the
person who will be elected to the White House by your people,''
said Falin.

<HEAD>Bush Set To Lock In Nomination With Delegates Picked Today</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush has had a virtual lock on the
Republican presidential nomination since late March, but today's
Pennsylvania primary should make it a mathematical certainty.
   The contest, in which Bush only faces token opposition from
former television evangelist Pat Robertson, should raise his
delegate total to more than the 1,139 needed for nomination at the
GOP convention in August in New Orleans.
   Savoring the situation on the eve of that vote, Bush told an
airport rally in Scranton, Pa., on Monday: ``We got a break in this
primary process. ... I'm glad it's gone my way.''
   The vice president noted that due to his overwhelming lead in
the race for the GOP nomination, the campaign spotlight has been
mostly on the Democratic contenders. But he said he wasn't
complaining.
   ``The news is being dominated by the Jackson-Dukakis fight.
That's the way it should be,' said Bush. ``I wouldn't trade
places.''
   Bush predicted that the general election ``is going to be hard
fought; it's going to be close.''
   The vice president was campaigning today in Ohio and Indiana,
both of which hold primaries a week from today. Bush was attending
a rally in Lima, Ohio, addressing the Ohio Broadcasters Association
in Cincinnati and holding an airport rally in Evansville, Ind.
   Bush tells audiences he'll still campaign through to the end of
the primary season and ``can't wait'' to debate the Democratic
nominee, who he has predicted will be Michael Dukakis.
   Even so, Bush remains vague on the terms for such events.
   ``I'm not going to let some outside group, even within my own
party, set the agenda,'' he told reporters in Pittsburgh.
   ``I'll appoint somebody who knows about setting up debates'' and
who could work with Democrats in coming up with a process agreeable
to both parties, he said.
   On another subject, Bush said in Pittsburgh that he fully backs
President Reagan's vow to veto trade legislation nearing a final
congressional vote.
   However, Bush said he hoped that some other way could be found
to notify workers of impending plant closings.
   The bill _ which Dukakis has said he would sign if he were
president _ contains a provision requiring 60 days advance when
plants are to be shut down.
   ``Maybe there's a compassionate way to give notice to a worker
and his family. But it has nothing to do with the trade bill,''
Bush said. ``I know it's an emotional issue but (the bill)
interferes with our ability to compete.''
   Bush did acknowledge that there were still areas of Pennsylvania
and elsewhere that had not shared fully in the economic recovery
that is now in its sixth year. But he criticized Democrats, saying
they ``talk about despair and agony.''
   ``You're going to see a clear choice'' in the general election,
he said.
   Bush has had a huge lead for the GOP nomination since his
remarkable 17-state sweep in the March 8 Super Tuesday contests, a
lead he solidified with the withdrawal from the race on March 29 of
Sen. Bob Dole, his only remaining major rival.
   Robertson is still technically a candidate but has ceased active
campaigning, saying there is no way Bush can be denied the
nomination. He has a scant 31 delegates, to Bush's 1,081.
   At his campaign appearance Monday at the Scranton-Wilkes-Barre
airport, Bush was confronted by about two dozen protesters.
   ``I'm glad to see the (Jesse) Jackson supporters here, or maybe
the Mike Dukakis supporters,'' he said.
   Of the Democrats, he said: ``I will welcome them in debate, I
will welcome taking on their ticket and we will beat them in the
fall.''

   Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, two
months on the job, has given liberals their first real cause for
concern that he will help forge a solid conservative court majority.
   Kennedy was part of a 5-4 majority that said Monday it is
thinking about overturning a 1976 decision considered a key civil
rights victory.
   The ruling 12 years ago, never undone by Congress, interpreted a
Civil War era law as allowing lawsuits for monetary damages against
private businesses and individuals over alleged racial
discrimination.
   The decision in Runyon vs. McCrary, adopted in hundreds of lower
court cases since, has become what one civil rights lawyer called
``a major strand of the civil rights enforcement infrastructure.''
   Monday's announcement sparked sharp criticism and dire
predictions. Four justices said it could shake minorities' faith in
the court.
   ``Time alone will tell whether the erosion of faith is
unnecessarily precipitous,'' said Justice John Paul Stevens, a
swing vote who most often sides with the court's liberals. ``But in
the meantime some of the harm that will flow from today's order may
never be completely undone.''
   Ira Glasser, executive director of the American Civil Liberties
Union, agreed. ``The message is there's a new court and previous
rulings are up for grabs,'' he said. ``If this decision possibly
can be overturned, perhaps a lot more are endangered.''
   The court's three Reagan appointees _ Kennedy and Justices
Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia _ joined Chief Justice William
H. Rehnquist and Byron R. White in voting to restudy the 1976
decision.
   Joining Stevens in dissent were Justices William J. Brennan,
Thurgood Marshall, the court's leading liberals, and Justice Harry
A. Blackmun, another swing vote.
   Will there be five votes to overturn the 1976 precedent?
   Rehnquist, long the court's most conservative member, and White,
a conservative with a generally liberal voting record in civil
rights cases, dissented from the 1976 decision. Two likely votes to
overturn.
   Scalia is considered as conservative as Rehnquist. A third vote.
   The keys may be the votes of O'Connor, who in recent years has
shown greater independence from the court's conservative bloc, and
Kennedy, who joined the court last Feb. 18.
   Kennedy won Senate confirmation only after Reagan's nomination
of Robert H. Bork was rejected.
   Bork's critics in the Senate and among the civil rights
organizations who opposed him said they feared his replacing
centrist Lewis F. Powell on the court could threaten 30 years of
civil rights precedents.
   In its first seven years, the Reagan administration has had
little success persuading the court to adopt the president's
conservative agenda: outlawing abortion, restoring prayers in
public schools and curtailing affirmative action.
   Kennedy, whose views on such matters are unknown, is viewed as a
staunch conservative less ideological than Bork. Some liberals
voiced the hope that he would assume Powell's role as the court's
voice of judicial restraint.
   But the concerns voiced during the Bork nomination fight were
echoed Monday.
   Calling Kennedy the key to a ``new court,'' the ACLU's Glaser
said: ``Bork had an extensive record of civil rights animus and
Kennedy did not. But this isn't encouraging.''

<HEAD>Report Says Nuclear Agency Should Improve Its Internal
Investigations</HEAD>

   Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chairman Lando
Zech says he agrees with a congressional study recommending that
the agency improve its internal investigations.
   He made the statement Monday as his agency released a study by
the General Accounting Office that said the NRC needs to ensure
that its investigations are done professionally and competently.
   ``The commission will give careful consideration to (the) entire
report in our continuing efforts to assure that we carry out our
investigative responsibilities fairly and efficiently,'' Zech said.
   In the study, GAO said ``the important mission and critical
safety role of the NRC require that it possess a first-rate
investigative capability.''
   GAO, the investigative wing of Congress, said the study was
based on review of three investigations made within the nuclear
agency. GAO said that in two cases, the work done by the NRC's
Office of Inspector and Auditor was not thorough enough.
   One case involved allegations by an NRC inspector that superiors
had pressured him to change findings in 1986 about safety
conditions at the Comanche Peak Steam Electric Station in Texas.
   The other involved alleged improper discussions in 1986 between
Victor Stello, the NRC's executive director of operations, and
Steve White, head of the Tennessee Valley Authority's NRC-regulated
nuclear program.
   GAO said its review supported the findings of NRC investigators
who said neither matter was improper. But in both cases GAO said
that NRC investigators had not interviewed individuals with key
roles.
   The third case looked into NRC's probe of how a copy of an
internal NRC document turned up in 1985 in the files of the
Louisiana Power and Light Company's Waterford III plant _ along
with a memo from LPL's holding company saying the document had been
``received from sources inside'' the NRC.
   GAO said notations on the copy indicated it was duplicated from
the file copy in the office of NRC Commissioner Thomas Roberts, who
was in charge of investigating the alleged leak.
   GAO was critical of the ``very limited'' investigation made by
Roberts, but GAO said it was unable to determine how the copy
reached the regulated utility.
   ``A properly conducted investigation might have provided NRC
with the identity'' of the leaker, according to GAO.
   The case, GAO said, ``demonstrated that a regulated utility
secured unauthorized access to NRC documents. The ability to obtain
such materials could impact on the NRC's enforcement program,
licensing functions and regulatory procedures.''
   ``The NRC should assure that its investigators conduct their
work in a competent manner using professional standards,'' said
GAO, adding that there is a lack of coordination between the NRC's
Office of Investigations and Office of Inspector and Auditor.

   Senate Republicans are trying to make sure the
medium-range missile treaty is ratified before President Reagan
meets Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Moscow on May 29, but
the majority leader says Democrats won't be rushed.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., appealed on Monday for
swift action on the treaty. He said the president deserves to be
accommodated on his wish not to go to Moscow empty-handed.
   President Reagan has said it is important for the Senate to
ratify the treaty before he meets Gorbachev because there is little
chance the two sides will make further arms control progress unless
the Senate has acted favorably.
   But Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia said he
refused ``to be rushed or harried'' on the matter before remaining
problems are cleared away.
   Byrd said he will not call up the treaty for debate before May
9. He added he may not do so then unless it can be shown the
Soviets agree with the U.S. position that the pact bans
medium-range ``futuristic'' weapons such as those using laser rays
or particle beam generators.
   Dole and other Republicans huddled Monday with White House chief
of staff Howard Baker and national security adviser Colin Powell to
devise a strategy to deal with Byrd's concerns and get the treaty
debate started.
   Byrd replied: ``I want to accommodate the president too, and
will accommodate the president where I can. ... But that is not my
first responsibility. ... That is not my first objective.
   ``I'm going to accommodate the Senate and our responsibilities
under the Constitution first, before the accommodation of anybody
else or any other office.''
   The treaty is silent on future weapons, but U.S. negotiators
contend the pact bans all weapons with ranges of from 300 miles to
3,400 miles, no matter how they are armed.

   Three ships were fighting a fire
on Brazil's largest offshore oil rig, and the state oil company,
Petrobas, said the blaze has caused an 11 percent drop in the
nation's petroleum output.
   Carlos Pinto, Petrobras spokesman, said the fire broke out
Sunday when gas leaked from the Enchova platform in the Campos
Basin, Brazil's richest oil-producing region, 120 miles east of Rio
De Janeiro. The 250 workers on the oil rig were safely evacuated to
a ship, he said.
   Three ships on Monday continued to spray the platform with water
in an effort to put out the fire, the spokesman said.
   Enchova and four connected fields were shut down, halting the
production of 71,000 barrels of oil and 2 million cubic meters of
gas per day, Pinto said.
   The campos basin offshore fields produce 60 percent of the
nation's oil output of 615,000 barrels a day and 40 percent of the
17 million cubic meters of gas. Brazil imports about 45 percent of
the oil it uses.

<HEAD>Veterans Of Atomic Testing, WWII To Get Benefits Under Senate Vote</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The quarter-million ``atomic veterans''
exposed to radiation during World War II and open-air nuclear tests
in the two decades that followed would receive new health benefits
under a bill before the House.
   The Democratic-controlled chamber is expected to vote on the
bill this week. The Senate passed it Monday by a 48-30 vote.
   House passage would send the measure to President Reagan, who
has threatened to veto the legislation because of its high costs
and because administration officials claim there is no scientific
basis for the bill.
   The measure would cost an estimated $36 million in its first
year to pay for extra medical benefits.
   The 250,000 surviving atomic veterans are U.S. service personnel
who took part in the occupation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki after
U.S. atomic bombs were dropped on those two Japanese cities in
August 1945, or who took part in open-air tests of atomic weapons
in the southern Pacific Ocean or Nevada.
   Many of the servicemen wore little or no protective gear during
the tests, and some have claimed that their exposure to radiation
caused cancer.
   The bill would make a presumptive finding that 13 different
cancers are related to their radiation exposure during the tests or
the Japanese service.
   Existing law provides that veterans who have cancer can be
compensated or receive health benefits, but they must show in each
case that the cancer is related to the military service.
   Only 28 of the nearly 5,000 veterans who have filed
radiation-related claims with the Veterans Administration have been
approved for disability benefits.
   The bill now before the House began as an amendment to a much
larger health and compensation bill for the nation's 27.4 million
military veterans.
   But the ``atomic veteran'' provision was dropped after the White
House said Reagan would veto a measure containing the amendment.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., chairman of the Senate Veterans
Affairs Committee, supported the measure because, he told his
colleagues, ``it is time to be fair to these men.''
   But Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., said the bill ``just ignores
sound, medical scientific evidence. ... It's just an absurd
approach toward compensation.''
   Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho, said that ``scientists are still
unsure about how much level ionizing radiation causes cancer.''
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., agreed _ up to a point.
   ``We do not yet know the full relationship between low-level
radiation and latent illness,'' he said. ``But it is crystal clear
that many of those responsible for setting policies that affect
thousands of our citizens are intent upon making the facts fit
their theories and decisions instead of the other way around.''

<HEAD>Possible Genetic Basis for Kidney Disease Among Blacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black people may have a gene that gives their
kidneys the unique ability to function well on very limited amounts
of salt, but which also can cause high blood pressure and disease
when too much salt is consumed, a researcher suggested today.
   Dr. Robert G. Luke of the University of Cincinnati Medical
Center said the existence of this unique kidney gene is suggested
by the mixed results of efforts to prevent disease by controlling
high blood pressure among black people.
   Speaking at a National Kidney Foundation seminar, Luke said
controlling high blood pressure, or hypertension, has resulted in a
reduction in stroke and heart disease.
   But it has not caused a reduction in the rate of a kidney
disease caused by hypertension. And striking differences between
the races suggest there may be a genetic-based difference in the
cause of high blood pressure.
   ``All kidney disease is more common among blacks than whites,''
said Luke, the chairman of the department of internal medicine at
the University of Cincinnati. ``End-stage renal disease (terminal
kidney failure) is three times more common in blacks than in
whites.''
   He said that at a Birmingham, Ala. transplant center, which
performs about half its transplants on black patients, there have
been many instances where kidneys transplanted from a white donor
to a black patient with high blood pressure has resulted in the
recipient becoming ``normotensive,'' or achieving a normal blood
pressure.
   ``This suggests that the cause of the original high blood
pressure was the patient's own kidneys,'' he said.
   Luke said hypertension among laboratory animals also has been
controlled by the transplant of kidneys from ``normotensive'' rats
to ones with high blood pressure.
   Studies also have shown, he said, that black people tend to
retain more salt, excreting less of the mineral in their urine than
white people.
   All of this suggests, said Luke, ``that a hereditary kidney
abnormality may actually cause high blood pressure.''
   He said there is speculation that this kidney characteristic
developed through evolution in central Africa where salt is
naturally very limited. In that environment, the kidney
characteristic represented a ``Darwinian advantage'' for people who
lived there, he said.
   ``In very hot and dry climates in inland areas of low
availability of (salt),'' he said, ``an ability of the kidney to
carefully and quickly conserve salt may confer a survival advantage
in evolution.''
   That advantage, however, becomes a disadvantage and eventually
leads to disease if there is an overabundance of salt in the diet,
said Luke.
   ``Chronic but subtle salt retention may lead over long periods
to high blood pressure possibly as a complication of the body's
response to try to force the kidney to excrete more salt,'' he said.
   And high blood pressure, in turn, often leads to kidney disease,
heart attack and stroke. Medication can control the high blood
pressure and reduce heart attack and stroke, but there is no
similar reduction in kidney disease, he said.
   But a genetic basis for high blood pressure is still
speculation, Luke said in an interview, ``and a puzzle that we are
still trying to understand.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Appeared Relaxed Heading Into Today's Pennsylvania Contest</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was story time for 28 toddlers and the
choice was an old favorite, ``The Very Hungry Caterpillar.'' But
the storyteller was a newcomer to the Discovery School _ Michael
Dukakis, the front-runner in today's Pennsylvania primary.
   He was a hit with the preschool set. Monday was a day of big
crowds and loud cheers for Dukakis, and the Massachusetts governor
was trying out a relaxed campaign style.
   Dukakis held a big lead over rival Jesse Jackson in
Pennsylvania, and about all aides had to wonder about was how big a
delegate victory he could win in the state.
   ``I look forward to working with you and to winning with you
tomorrow,'' Dukakis told about 500 people in Pittsburgh on the eve
of the primary.
   In his final day of campaigning before the Pennsylvania vote,
Dukakis was at ease and ready to quip.
   ``I saw a Bush sign around here some place,'' he asked 1,000
gathered on the University of Scranton campus.``You know, Bush is
the only guy who had a baseball league named after him.''
   Then he asked if the crowd held any fans of the Baltimore
Orioles _ the team with the worst record in baseball at the moment.
   ``Where are the Orioles fans around here? You know if you're an
Orioles fan you have to be headed for a career in social work or
something. You have to be very charitable,'' he said.
   But Scranton brought Dukakis face-to-face with some of the most
strident demonstrators of the campaign thus far. Fifty
anti-abortion protesters sought to form a gantlet for the candidate
outside the hall at the University of Scranton.
   ``Stop Dukakis! Stop abortion!'' they chanted. Dukakis was
escorted to the car by a group of aides and police officers, amid
much pushing and shoving.
   From Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, from Erie to Harrisburg,
Dukakis took his message of jobs and party unity.
   ``There is no more important challenge facing the president of
United States. Make no mistake about it. I'm a dyed-in-the-wool,
true-blue full-employment Democrat,'' he said in Erie.
   He repeatedly urged his supporters to ignore the polls and to
get out the vote _ ``Pollsters don't vote,'' he said.
   A win in the complicated election Tuesday would boost his lead
for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination in both delegates
and momentum.
   ``It isn't enough just to vote for me,'' he told 2,000 cheering
supporters at a park in Erie. ``This is one election where you've
got to vote more than once and it's legal. I need your vote as a
candidate. Our delegates need your votes. ... We must do both.''
   The crowd was enthusiastic, often interrupting Dukakis with
applause and cheers. After the speech, many in the crowd pressed
forward to touch Dukakis and to shake his hand. Several babies were
handed to him. Smiling, he kisssed them.
   ``With your help, we can leave Pennsylvania with the kind of
enthusiasm and the kind of energy and the kind of momentum that a
victory will give,'' he told them.
   At his first stop in Phildelphia, Dukakis reached out to the
black community that is the core of Jackson's support.
   ``We have too much to do in this country to divide ourselves,''
Dukakis told about 60 people gathered a black church in Northeast
Philadelphia. ``I'm someone who believes that one of the jobs of a
governor and a president _ perhaps the most important job _ is to
bring this country together, brown, black and white, business and
labor. These past seven years have been a divisive seven years.''

   A strike by 15,000 clerical workers
interrupted domestic airline service and forced many shops and
businesses to close.
   The workers began their strike on Friday in an attempt to win a
27 percent increase for the lowest paid among them.
   Icelandair halted local flights because of the strike, and
clerical workers were expected to walk out of Keflavik
international airport on Wednesday.
   Hotels in Reykjavik were nearly empty on Monday, and hotel
managers said their financial loss will be considerable if the
strike continues.
   The workers struck after the employers' organization turned down
a demand by the unions that minimum wages be increased by 27
percent.

   Cardinal John Dearden, the retired Roman Catholic

corrected fluid congestion in his lungs, officials said.
   Dearden, 80, was resting comfortably Monday afternoon at
Providence Hospital in Southfield and would be kept several days
for observation, said Brenda Marshall, a spokeswoman for the
archdiocese.
   Doctors treated the congestion with medication and did not
expect complications, Marshall said. But Dearden was listed in
serious but stable condition because of his age and because he
suffered a heart attack in 1977, she said.
   Dearden cited health reasons and age for retiring in 1980 as
spiritual leader of the 1.2-million-member archdiocese, a post he
had held 21 years. He was succeeded by the Rev. Edmund Szoka.

   Harvard Law School Dean James Vorenberg
announced he will resign at the end of the 1988-89 academic year to
return to teaching, the school said.
   Vorenberg, 60, was appointed dean in 1981.
   Harvard President Derek Bok said Monday he accepted the
resignation with ``great regret but much admiration for his
tenure.''
   ``Under Jim Vorenberg's leadership, the law school has not only
maintained the traditional excellence of its academic program but
has broadened its curriculum to meet the challenges of contemporary
society and the needs of today's legal profession,'' he said.
   Bok said that under Vorenberg the law school has developed new
programs in areas such as human rights, law and economics, and
international criminal justice.
   Vorenberg also introduced a plan to help pay educational loans
for students and alumni accepting low-paying, law-related jobs, Bok
said.
   Bok said a search for Vorenberg's successor would begin this
summer.

<HEAD>Lyng Says Europe Needs to Address Market Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community needs to get
serious about seeking solutions to ``an increasingly chaotic
condition'' in global agricultural trade, says Agriculture
Secretary Richard E. Lyng.
   But the EEC ``is unwilling to even define a longterm goal in the
reform of the rules of international trade,'' Lyng said. ``They
term our proposal to eventually eliminate trade-distorting
subsidies as `unrealistic' or `too far, too fast.' Yet, they have
not stated what alternative they will accept.''
   It has been almost a year and a half since the new Uruguay Round
of multinational trade talks began under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, or GATT. Yet, Lyng said, the major agricultural
shippers are expanding export subsidies rather than reducing them.
   Lyng warned that failure to make progress in the negotiations by
the time of the GATT midterm review in Montreal next December
``will bring into question the chance for eventual success'' of the
Uruguay Round.
   ``I'm not pessimistic, but I'll have to admit there's not a
whole lot to be optimistic about at this point,'' Lyng said.
   Lyng said the EEC, for example, has just paid a subsidy equal to
$126 per metric ton to wheat exporters, and continues to pay ``huge
subsidies on a host of other commodities'' including mixed feed,
$291 per ton; durum wheat, $281 per ton; and barley, $130 per ton.
   The United States, he said at a meeting of the Newspaper Farm
Editors of America, is calling for agricultural trade reform at the
Uruguay Round. Ultimately, under the U.S. proposal, international
trade barriers and subsidies would be eliminated over a period of
10 years or so.
   Lyng said the ``excessive influence of governments in farm
product markets leads to a grossly inefficient allocation of
resources in developed countries and leave poorer, developing
countries in economic shambles.''
   The worst offenders are the big nations ``who are unwilling or
reluctant to change,'' he said. Japan, with huge trade surpluses
from exports of industrial and consumer goods, clings to import
barriers on products such as beef, rice and citrus.
   Other exporting countries, including the EEC, say they are not
alone in subsidizing agricultural trade and point to the Export
Enhancement Program operated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
   Under EEP, as it is known, private exporters are given surplus
USDA-owned commodities so they can sell grain or other products to
selected foreign countries, including the Soviet Union, China and
others. Department officials claim EEP was necessary to compete
with Europe's subsidized exports.
   After Lyng spoke to the farm editors, his department routinely
announced several more export subsidy actions under the program.
China was sold an additional 95,000 tons of U.S. wheat, which
carried subsidies of $27.52 per ton.
   Another EEP subsidy was for 300 tons of frozen broiler chickens
or fryer legs sold to the Canary Islands. The subsidies amounted to
about $237 per ton. Officials said an additional 400 tons of frozen
poultry are still available for sale to the Canary Islands at
subsidized prices.

   A private contractor has helped farmers in
five southwest Kansas counties beat a federal deadline for
conservation planning, says the Agriculture Department.
   Wilson Scaling, chief of the department's Soil Conservation
Service, said Monday a consulting company _ John Ho and Associates
Inc., Dallas, Texas _ completed planning by mid-April, less than
half the time called for in its one-year contract.
   The 1985 farm law gives farmers until Dec. 31, 1989, to complete
conservation plans for protecting highly erodible land. Scaling
said district conservationists in Kansas said they would not be
able to help all the farmers with planning in time to meet the
deadline.
   ``One of the most successful ideas was to contract out the
planning to a qualified private company,'' he said.
   Kansas has the second-largest amount of cropland of any state,
some 29.1 million acres, he said. Of that, the agency estimates
more than one-third is highly erodible.
   The counties included in the contract with the Texas firm were
Finney, Greeley, Hamilton, Seward and Wichita.

   A bill banning abortion, which sponsors

   Supporters said they may attempt to revive the measure, termed

   The House voted 30-28 in favor of the bill, one short of the 31
needed for passage.
   The Supreme Court legalized abortion with its landmark Roe vs.
Wade decision in 1973. Backers of the Arizona legislation, which
would have made abortion illegal except to save the life of the
mother, said they believed that the present Supreme Court might
reverse the 1973 decision if given the chance to do so.
   Supporters of the bill said its passage would make Arizona the
first state to outlaw abortion since the Supreme Court decision.
   Noting how close they had come to getting the bill passed,
backers said they would consider bringing it back for another vote
before the end of the current legislation session.
   But, even if it succeeds in the House, the chances of the bill's
becoming law appeared to be slim.
   Gov. Rose Mofford announced that she probably would veto it.
   ``My impression is that it's unconstitional,'' Mrs. Mofford
said, adding ``I can't legislate morality.''

   ``Beetlejuice,'' the supernatural spoof
featuring Michael Keaton's romp in the hereafter, was the nation's
film box office leader last weekend, beating ``Casual Sex?'' and
``Colors'' by a wide margin.
   ``Beetlejuice'' returned $6.2 million while the teen-movie
``Casual Sex?'' narrowly edged the gang-film ``Colors'' for the No.
2 spot. Both movies made $3.8 million.
   Other than a few fistfights, the debut two weeks ago of
``Colors'' didn't incite the violence predicted by some officials.
But last weekend, gunfire erupted between suspected gang members
outside a theater in Stockton.
   A Los Angeles gang member reportedly upset with the way his gang
was depicted in the movie fatally shot a possible rival gang member.
   Mann Theaters of Los Angeles voluntarily pulled the movie from
the Regency Theater where the shooting occurred, said San Joaquin
County District Attorney John Phillips.
   The non-stop carnage in ``Above the Law,'' featuring a Chicago
cop's single-handed drug-ring battle, brought in $3.2 million to
finish fourth last weekend.
   ``Biloxi Blues,'' the Neil Simon yarn starring Matthew Broderick
as an Army boot camp private, was fifth at $2.8 million.
   ``The Last Emperor,'' the Bernardo Bertolucci epic that won nine
Academy Awards earlier this month, was sixth with $2.6 million and
``Moonstruck,'' which won Oscars for Cher and Olympia Dukakis, was
seventh with $2.3 million.
   The Disney Studios took the No. 8 and No. 9 spots with ``Return
to Snowy River II'' and ``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' respectively.
The ``Snowy River'' sequel brought in $2.1 million and ``Good
Morning, Vietnam'' grossed $1.4 million.
   The Robert Redford-directed film ``Milagro Beanfield War''
rounded out the top 10 with $1.4 million.
   Here are the top films for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor

   Belgians crave crawdads but have yet to sample
catfish, while Saudi Arabians find American rice so much to their
liking that they package rice from Thailand to make it look as if
it came from here, the Department of Agriculture says.
   Those are a few of the useful bits of knowledge for Americans
who want to export food products compiled by the department in a
recent 204-page book called ``Trade Policies and Market
Opportunities for U.S. Farm Exports.'' It tells of quotas, tariffs,
surcharges, health and sanitary rules and other restrictions that
plague American exporters to more than 100 countries.
   The April issue of the department's magazine, ``Foreign
Agriculture,'' gives an account of the report.
   For example, wine can't be advertised in Norway and Sweden _
governments there want to hold down drinking. In France, it's
margarine that can't be advertised because the government wants to
protect French dairy farmers from competition on their sales of
butter.
   Egypt won't buy almonds at all because it's protecting its
meager stock of foreign exchange. India won't buy tallow for
religious reasons: the cows it is made from are sacred to Hindus.
Italy is said to know too little about American tallow to order it.
   None of the 12 countries in the European Community will buy
foreign meat if it's mixed with soy protein _ they say it's to
protect consumers.
   There's no duty in Austria on imports of that American rice the
Saudis like so much. Bahrain, a Saudi neighbor, buys rice almost
entirely from India and Pakistan.
   The book makes no judgment on whether the obstacles are fair or
unfair, an issue much discussed in Congress during the current
debate on the trade bill.
   ``Virtually every country provides support and protection to
agriculture in some degree,'' it explains. ``In some cases this is
done primarily through policies that raise prices to consumers by
protecting the domestic market; in other cases, assistance is
provided through subsidies financed by the taxpayer.''
   In some cases, the countries do not believe that their actions
constitute barriers. In other cases, the book implies that American
producers could do more to sell their products. Under the heading
``reason for the barrier'' a frequent explanation is ``lack of
awareness.''
   That is the cause it gives for low sales in Japan not only of
American catfish and crayfish _ which are lumped together _ but
also grapefruit juice, frozen potatoes, wood panel products,
hardwoods from temperate climates and beer.
   Belgium is also noted as a country where lack of awareness of
the American product keeps down the sale of catfish. The book says
nothing about the Belgian appetite for crayfish, which is
considerable.

<HEAD>Kingdom To Sign Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia on Tuesday decided to sign
the nuclear weapons non-proliferation treaty, a strong indication
it will not seek nuclear warheads for intermediate-range missiles
it recently acquired from China.
   The official Saudi Press Agency reported that King Fahd made the
decision during a Cabinet meeting in Riyadh, the Saudi capital.
   The meeting was called in response to a recommendation by Prince
Saud al-Faisal, the Saudi foreign minister, that the kingdom sign
the international treaty against the spread of nuclear arms.
   An account of the Cabinet discussions and decisions at the
meeting, which ended before dawn, was issued by Information
Minister Ali al-Shaer and distributed by the agency. The agency,
monitored in Bahrain, did not elaborate.
   It appeared the timing of the decision was designed primarily to
reassure the United States that the kingdom will not try to arm its
CSS-2 missiles with nuclear warheads. The decision also was viewed
as an attempt to blunt Israel's allegations that the missiles
constituted a threat to its safety.
   Saudi Arabia, the Middle East petroleum giant and the world's
largest exporter of crude oil, was reported to have recently
acquired from Beijing an undisclosed number of CSS-2 missiles
capable of reaching virtually any point in the Middle East,
including Israel.
   Israel has voiced fears the Saudis might be seeking to acquire
nuclear warheads for the missiles and indicated it might deal a
preemptive blow.

<HEAD>Coast Guard Dedicates Drug Interceptor Plane Equipped with
Infrared, Radar</HEAD>

   A newly modified Coast Guard jet which has
radar and infrared systems will enable pilots to lock onto and
track suspected drug traffickers' planes through clouds or darkness.
   The first of a fleet of nine Nighthawks, as they're nicknamed,
was dedicated at a ceremony Monday in a hangar at National Airport.
   ``It's a particularly bad day for those who would smuggle drugs
into this country,'' Adm. Paul A. Yost, commandant of the Coast
Guard, said at the dedication.
   ``Now that I've got these aircraft, I say to the drug smugglers
two things: If you're in the business, I'd look for other
employment, and you can run but you can't hide,'' Yost said.
   The planes, which will initially be based in Miami and Mobile,
Ala., are modified versions of the Coast Guard's medium-range
surveillance jet, the HU-25A Guardian, built by Falcon Jet Corp. of
Little Rock, Ark.
   They have been equipped with a sensor system that combines the
long-range radar used in the F-16 fighter jet with a
forward-looking infrared, or FLIR, sensor.
   Previously, Coast Guard planes were equipped with a radar system
designed to track ships and no infrared at all, said Lt. Bob Quirk,
the Coast Guard interceptor pilot who flew the first completed
Nighthawk to Washington for the dedication.
   ``Before, we did not have any altitude information (on the
target planes); we did not have any closure speed information
besides what we could judge with our eyeball,'' Quirk said.
   ``This jet is twice as fast as any other Coast Guard plane,''
said Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato, R-N.Y., who appeared at the
dedication. ``It can fly at 380 knots at 20,000 feet above sea
level for five hours up to 2,045 miles.''
   Transportation Secretary James Burnley, who also participated in
the ceremony, said the United States is ``under siege'' by drug
dealers.
   ``When you're under attack by a formidable enemy ... you've got
to have state-of-the-art weaponry and you've got to have
leadership,'' he said.
   The project, which cost approximately $47 million for all nine
jets including training for about 30 pilots, was funded through the
Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986.
   Yost predicted that eventually all the planes would be based in
Miami to stem drug smuggling from the Caribbean.

   Sheriff's deputies arrested a man Monday
night in the weekend shooting death of a pregnant woman who gave
birth minutes before she died.
   Kenneth Charles Hodges, 44, was arrested about 7:30 p.m. at a
Murray residence and was being booked for investigation of
first-degree murder in Friday night's slaying of Anna Holmes, 31,
of West Valley City, Salt Lake County Sheriff Pete Hayward said.
   The woman was shot in the head at a Kearns video store during a
robbery and died minutes after giving birth by Caesarean section to
a fourth daughter.
   Authorities received an anonymous tip Sunday night regarding
Hodges' whereabouts, Hayward said. Hundreds of calls had been
received in the case.
   ``We're always waiting for the one that rings the bell. This was
one of them,'' he said.
   Hodges also is wanted in Eureka, Calif., for property crimes,
and has a long list of arrests in Salt Lake County, Hayward said.
   A second man authorities have said might have driven the car
away from the store had not been located, but Hayward said
authorities had some leads on his whereabouts.
   The woman, eight months pregnant, was shot in the Voyager Video
store as her three daughters and three neighbor children watched.
   After getting between $300 to $350 from the clerk and stuffing
the cash in in a green canvas bag, the gunman grabbed her, placed
his handgun against her head and shot her, authorities said.
   Just before the woman died, the baby girl was delivered at
University of Utah Health Sciences Center. The infant was in
serious but stable condition Monday, a hospital spokeswoman said.

<HEAD>Tug Of War Over Trade Bill Under Way in Senate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tug of war is under way in the Senate as
sponsors of a 1,000-page trade bill move to line up enough votes to
show they could override a threatened presidential veto.
   ``You let this bill go down the tubes and I'll tell you where
the champagne corks will be popping,'' Finance Committee Chairman
Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, told senators Monday. ``They'll be popping
in Japan and they'll be popping in Germany.''
   The bill is expected to clear the Senate with votes to spare.
But from there it heads for the White House and, evidently, a
presidential veto.
   The question is whether it will receives the two-thirds support
it would need to override a veto. Sponsors and the administration
are looking for any wavering votes they can still find.
   Major provisions of the bill would streamline the system under
which the United States imposes import curbs to punish
international trade violations and aid industries threatened by
foreign competition.
   Other provisions range from billions of dollars in new
agricultural subsidies to repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil
companies.
   The administration has saved most of its fire lately for a
provision that would require all but the smallest employers to give
60-day notice of plant closings and large-scale layoffs.
   The Senate had been set to vote today, but with neither side
satisfied that it had done everything possible, leaders said they
might wait until Wednesday.
   As the showdown neared, lawmakers and congressional staffers on
both sides said the outcome appeared too close to call.
   Democrats were expected to vote for the bill overwhelmingly
while Republicans were divided on whether to stand by the Reagan
administration in hopes of getting a slimmed-down version later.
   ``It's close,'' Bentsen told reporters. ``It was an uphill
battle, but now it's a tossup.''
   The House approved the measure 312-107 on Thursday, more than
enough to override a veto.
   ``I know this is an election year and the majority party may be
looking for a campaign issue rather than a trade bill, but I am
confident the Congress could pass a better bill if this one is
rejected,'' Sen. Robert T. Stafford, R-Vt., said.
   Democratic leaders have been saying it would be tough to bring
another trade bill onto the Senate floor before Congress leaves
Washington to campaign full time this fall.
   For one thing, they say, bringing such a bill onto the Senate
floor without something like the year of committee consideration
that shaped the current version could make the new one a target for
an array of amendments that in themselves could torpedo the measure.
   As dubious as they have been about a stripped-down trade bill,
however, Democratic leaders have left the door open a crack for
such an effort if Reagan's veto is sustained.
   One of the first items to go in any new bill could be the
plant-closings provision.
   Business groups say it would dry up capital for investment and
frighten off customers, but it has strong backing from labor.
   Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., told the Senate ``high officials
of the administration'' had told him that portions of the bill
``are acceptable to the administration.''
   ``We pulled off the hat trick, we pulled off the miracle,''
Danforth said. ``The administration now says that while it's not
perfect it is something that the president would be willing to sign
without plant closings.''

<HEAD>Fish Oil May Solve Serious Transplant Drug Problem, Says
Researcher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fish oil may help the thousands of patients
each year who receive life-saving organ transplants only to develop
serious kidney disease from the toxic effects of a drug needed to
prevent organ rejection, a researcher says.
   Dr. William M. Bennett said Monday that three medical centers
now are testing the use of fish oil to smooth out the harsh side
effects of cyclosporine, a drug taken by transplant patients to
prevent organ rejection.
   The beneficial effects of cyclosporine have made it possible for
thousands to receive kidney, heart and liver transplants. The
primary action of the drug is to supress the body's immune response.
   Side effects of the drug, however, can be very serious for
patients already in delicate health.
   Bennett, speaking at a National Kidney Foundation seminar, said
virtually every patient who takes cyclosprine suffers some change
in kidney function, probably as the result of constricted flow
through blood vessels of the kidney.
   At least one heart transplant patient, he said, has survived the
transplant operation only to suffer complete kidney failure due to
the toxic effects of cyclosporine.
   Bennett, a professor at the Oregon Health Sciences University in
Portland, said he and other researchers determined in laboratory
studies that by mixing cyclosporine with a fish oil high in omega-3
fatty acid its bad side effects can be reduced without blocking the
good results.
   Oil from fishes such as salmon and other cold water fish, said
Bennett, are known to reduce the formation of thromboxanes, a
protein that causes blood vessels to constrict. In laboratory
animals, he said, this effect of fish oil seems to counter kidney
damage caused by cyclosporine.
   A limited number of patients now are receiving the fish oil and
cyclosporine at clinics in Portland, Ore. and Boston, he said.
   Bennett said if the toxic effects of cyclosporine can be
countered successfully, then there may be expanded uses for the
drug. Use of cyclosporine has been suggested in such auto immune
diseases as rheumatoid arthritis and some types of diabetes.
   Another researcher at the National Kidney Foundation seminar
said extensive clinical trials are under way on a new
genetically-engineered hormone that will counter anemia among
patients who must depend on artificial kidneys.
   Dr. Joseph W. Eschbach, a professor at the University of
Washington in Seattle, said more than 100,000 Americans with failed
kidneys are receiving dialysis, a procedure that cleans the blood
of impurities normally filtered out by the kidneys.
   Up to 75,000 of these patients suffer from anemia, characterized
by a shortage in their blood of red cells, which carry oxygen to
the cells. For about 25,000, the problem is so serious that they
must receive blood transfusions.
   Because of the anemia, Eschbach said that only about a third of
the dialysis patients are able to return to work and many ``become
part of the couch. All they can do is just lie there.''
   The federal government spends about $2 billion a year caring for
dialysis patients, he said, and some of this money could be saved
if more patients were able to correct their anemia.
   Eschbach said research has shown that the reason for this anemia
is that the failed kidneys no longer produce a hormone called
erythropoietin. In normal function, the kidneys secrete this
hormone when red cells are reduced in the blood. The hormone goes
to the bone marrow and causes blood formation tissue there to make
more red blood cells.
   Scientists have now isolated the human gene that makes the
hormone. This gene has been inserted into the nucleus of Chinese
hamster ovary cells which now are producing large amounts of
erythropoietin.
   Dialysis patients who have received erythropoietin injections,
said Eschbach, have recovered from their anemia and many have
returned to work.
   Some have improved to the point that they have been able to
receive kidney transplants and are no longer on dialysis, he said.
   The hormone now is in clinical trials and is expected to be
available for general use by next spring.

<HEAD>North, Other Iran-Contra Defendants on Collision Course with Judge</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Lawyers for Oliver L. North and his
Iran-Contra co-defendants are on a collision course with the judge,
as they argue for dismissal of the case on grounds that evidence
was gathered illegally.
   A pre-trial hearing Monday began on a sour note for the defense
team, when U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell ruled lawyers for
North and two other defendants violated his ground rules for the
hearing, and would be barred from presenting any witnesses.
   From that point the proceeding rolled downhill for the defense
lawyers, as Gesell rebuffed their request to question the top
prosecutors _ and grand jury witnesses _ about their exposure to
testimony given to Congress under a grant of immunity.
   Nor would Gesell permit the defense to immediately review
instructions given by independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh and his
staff to grand jurors, when they were advised in their secret
proceedings to avoid news accounts of the congressional hearings.
   ``I have a great sense of unfairness for my client,'' complained
North lawyer Brendan V. Sullivan Jr. as the hearing dragged on.
   Gesell responded moments later, ``I don't think lawyers should
run'' the hearing. ``I should.''
   Nonetheless, Gesell made no final ruling on Sullivan's charge of
``enormous taint'' in the case, and the judge scheduled another
hearing for Wednesday.
   If Gesell finds after that hearing questions remain about the
validity of the prosecution evidence, he can order further hearings
on the subject that could push back the judge's initial hope for a
July trial date.
   Walsh is barred from using a witness' immunized testimony to
prosecute that witness, except for perjury. However, the judge said
it would still be possible to have a trial even if some evidence
were obtained improperly, because the ``tainted'' evidence and
certain witnesses could be barred from the case.
   Three defendants testified before Congress last summer under
immunity grants: North, the former National Security Council
staffer who directed the once-secret operations that sent arms to
Iran, and to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels when such assistance was
prohibited by law; his boss at the time, National Security Adviser
John M. Poindexter; and businessman Albert Hakim, who handled the
millions of dollars in Iran arms sales profits that were stashed in
Swiss bank accounts.
   Hakim's partner, retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord,
is the fourth defendant but his leadoff testimony at the
congressional hearings was given without an immunity grant.
   The defendants are charged with conspiring to use U.S. arms
sales profits illegally to aid the Contras, and to cover up their
actions. They also are accused of theft of government property,
obstruction of government inquiries, making false statements, and
destruction of documents.
   While Monday's proceedings were under way, defense lawyers filed
a notice that they would appeal Gesell's pre-trial rulings that
went against them.
   The judge had invited them to do so during the hearing, saying
the defense objections ``stand out like the Statue of Liberty.''
   ``Go ahead and have your romp upstairs (in the appeals court),''
Gesell said.
   The only witness Monday was Walsh, who testified about his
repeated written and oral instructors to his staff, to witnesses
and to grand jurors to avoid being influenced by immunized
testimony. He said his evidence was gathered independently, and
filed weekly with the court.
   Walsh did admit, however, that one of his assistants,
Christopher Todd, has voluntarily withdrawn from aspects of the
case because of possible exposure to immunized testimony.
   ``I don't know anything about the conditions'' that prompted
Todd's decision, Walsh said. ``He didn't want to taint me. I don't
know whether he was tainted or not.''
   Sullivan hammered again and again at Walsh's admission that he
didn't know whether everyone complied with his orders. Compliance,
Walsh said, sometimes required a degree of common sense.
   The prosecutor sarcastically told Sullivan ``there was no
discussion of how quickly you could turn off the television'' if a
report on the congressional hearings came on.
   And when Sullivan pointed out that comedy shows such as
``Saturday Night Live'' made references to immunized testimony,
Walsh said he had no idea whether those receiving his instructions
turned off the programs.
   But Walsh said each of his assistants knows ``he's jeopardizing
the investigation if he's careless.''
   Herbert J. Stern, a former federal judge and veteran prosecutor
representing Walsh on the immunity issue, said he can show ``every
bit of the evidence was independently derived.''
   ``The extensive procedures of insulation are just extras and are
really not needed,'' Stern said.

   Jesse Jackson appears to be retaining the
support of his most loyal constituencies, the Arab-Americans,
despite upsetting many of them with comments about Palestine
Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat.
   ``There's still a great deal of spirit out there for Jesse,''
especially after Jackson modified his remarks on Arafat, said
Abdeen Jabara, president of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination
Committee.
   Arab-Americans have contributed more than $400,000 to Jackson's
1988 presidential campaign, including some $90,000 raised Sunday at
a private home in Washington, according to his key Arab affairs
adviser James Zogby. A handful of fund-raising events are scheduled
in coming weeks in California, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New York and
Ohio.
   One of Jackson's most prominent Arab-American backers, radio
personality Casey Kasem, is planning a big fundraiser in Los
Angeles just before California's June 7 primary.
   And there are 43 Arabs and Muslims running to be Jackson
delegates in California, according to Salam Al-Marayati of the
Muslim Political Action Committee in Los Angeles.
   Jackson appears to have assuaged the concerns of some Arab
supporters who were upset by his comment on CBS-TV's ``Face the
Nation'' that as president he would not meet with Arafat.
   Jabara accused Jackson of ``caving in'' to Jewish groups, and
said many members of his group were dismayed by the TV interview.
   But the transcript of a subsequent interview that was printed in
the New York Times seemed to ``clear up any misunderstandings,''
Jabara said.
   In that interview, Jackson pointed out there is a law, which he
said should be changed, prohibiting U.S. officials from talking to
the PLO because the PLO does not recognize Israel.
   He said the PLO is ``by far the most representative organization
of the Palestinian people'' and should be represented at the
negotiating table.
   The developments were important to many Arab-Americans, who have
long looked to Jackson as their voice in the U.S. political world.
   Jackson's relationship with the Arabs goes back to 1979 when as
a private but well-known citizen he visited the Middle East on a
fact-finding tour and was photographed embracing Arafat.
   That picture still angers many American Jews. But the Arabs see
Jackson as a leader who is interested in the rights of their people
as well as the security of Israel.
   For many years Jackson has held that the U.S. policy against
negotiating with the PLO is counterproductive.
   His support for establishment of a Palestinian homeland also has
endeared him to the Arabs. But he also contends the Arab states and
Palestinians must recognize Israel's right to exist.
   During Jackson's 1984 presidential campaign, his Arab ties
created a stir when it was disclosed that his Chicago-based civil
rights organization had received $200,000 from the Arab League, a
group of Arab governments.
   The contributions to the education-oriented PUSH for Excellence
and the PUSH Foundation caused controversy, especially among Jewish
groups who contended Jackson was too dependent on Arab money.
   Zogby, head of the Arab-American Institute, said Arab-Americans,
who number an estimated 2 million throughout the country mostly
concentrated in about a dozen cities, had achieved finanical and
social security but felt excluded politically until Jackson's 1984
presidential race.
   ``Jackson brought them into the process and they don't forget
that.''
   He acknowledged Jackson's televised comments two weeks ago
caused, ``an initial round of concern.''
   But he said Arab support again was pouring in by the time the
New York campaign ended April 19, and New York Mayor Ed Koch had
savaged Jackson as being anti-Israeli.
   After the ``Face the Nation'' interview, some members of the
National Association of Arab-Americans raised questions, said Liela
Calnan, New England coordinator for the group.
   ``They didn't understand. I know a few Arabs in California that
thought the would be turning against them,'' she said.
   But she said they were willing to give Jackson another chance
because of his record. ``He defends Palestinians constantly... He
never fails, whether there's Arabs there or not, to mention
Palestinian self determination.''
   She said Arabs would be unlikely to support Dukakis ``because of
his wife'' who is Jewish.
   Jabara initially wrote a public letter to Jackson accusing him
of ``tailoring your positions'' to appease Jewish voters before the
New York primary.
   Jackson had said on ``Face the Nation'' that it ``would be a
mistake'' to try and sit Arafat at a negotiating table with Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir because that would be ``asking for a
bonafide explosion.''
   Asked if he himself would sit down with Arafat, he said, ``I
would not. And it's not necessary to do that. We must not equate
Arafat an the PLO with a sovereign people, the Palestinian people.''

<HEAD>Jackson Makes Election-Eve Appeal At Harrisburg Rally</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL BLOOD</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential candidate Jesse
Jackson made an election-eve appeal for support in today's
Pennsylvania primary, telling a chanting crowd at a rally: ``This
room is full of hope today.''
   Jackson came to the state capital for a meeting with Gov. Robert
P. Casey and staged a rally that drew a crowd of 2,000.
   Jackson was holding meetings in Washington this morning with a
State Department official and members of Congress, and heading
later to Ohio, which holds its primary a week from today.
   At the Harrisburg rally, Jackson stressed the themes that have
been the cornerstone of his campaign: reversing Reagan
administration economic policies, fighting drug abuse, and bringing
more Americans into the political process.
   ``This room is full of hope today. A great dimension of our
campaign is to keep hope alive. Our mission is to keep America
strong and make America better,'' Jackson told the crowd.
   ``In this room today are farmers and workers; the black, the
white, the brown, the red, the yellow, the middle class, the lower
class .... We the people have come together to find common
ground,'' he said.
   Jackson's campaign stop in Harrisburg was one of several he made
across Pennsylvania Monday, the day before the state's 2.8 million
Democrats were going to the polls to voice their preference for the
party's presidential nominee.
   Jackson also made appearances in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia,
where much of his support is rooted.
   In Pittsburgh, Jackson was questioned repeatedly about a
statement he made Sunday regarding negotiation with terrorists.
   Jackson said Monday he could conceive of situations where he
would grant safe passage to hostage-takers, saying ``I choose
negotiation over blind bloody confrontation.'' He rejected what he
called ``material concessions'' to terrorists but did not rule out
political accommodation
   ``If we are going to deter terrorism, we must address the
underlying causes of terrorism,'' he said after an appearance at a
high school in Pittsburgh. ``Terrorism does not emerge out of the
blue.''
   Jackson said Sunday he disagreed with Dukakis' position that
``we should not negotiate with terrorists.'' Jackson said, ``I
disagree with that; if I could get the hostages out, I'd do it.''
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said Monday the U.S.
government will ``talk to anyone, to any group, to any government
about the well-being and release of the Americans still held
hostage in Lebanon.''
   But she added, ``We will not make concessions to terrorists or
compromise our fundamental principles.''
   Jackson, who polls say is lagging behind Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis in today's contest, has been campaigning heavily in
urban areas in recent days.
   A poll released Monday by KYW-TV in Philadelphia and KDKA-TV in
Pittsburgh showed Dukakis led Jackson by 26 percentage points, with
57 percent for Dukakis, 31 percent for Jackson and 12 percent
undecided.
   Jackson arrived at the Harrisburg rally behind schedule. The
wait, however, did not dampen the spirits of those attending the
rally, and Jackson was greeted at the podium by thunderous applause
and shouts of encouragement.
   ``I seek to lead our nation beyond racism, beyond sexism, beyond
anti-Semitism, beyond escapism and beyond war. We must make America
better and keep America strong,'' Jackson said to cheers.
   He called for more spending to fight drug abuse.
   ``You just don't say no to a $150 billion-a-year industry,''
Jackson said, referring to First Lady Nancy Reagan's advice that
youngsters ``just say no'' to drugs.
   ``If you want to fight a war you've got to have a budget,'' he
said.
   Following his address, Jackson met briefly with Casey, also a
Democrat, who has not endorsed a presidential candidate.
   ``We're very impressed with the ideas he's expressed for
investing in America, infrastructure investment programs and the
war on drugs ....'' Casey said.
   Reginald Williams, a Hershey resident who attended the
Harrisburg rally, said he was impressed with Jackson's concern for
all residents.
   ``We have a chance to make history. Even if his nomination fails
on the convention floor, we have made history,'' he said.

<HEAD>Robertson Ordered To Pay $28,000 In Court Costs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for both Pat Robertson and the former
congressman he sued for questioning his war record said they were
pleased by an order that the former television evangelist pay
$28,000 in court costs.
   Rep. Paul N. ``Pete'' McCloskey was sued in 1986 after he
claimed that Robertson had used the political influence of his late
father, Sen. A. Willis Robertson, D-Va., to avoid combat duty
during the Korean War.
   Robertson dropped the lawsuit last month rather than go to trial
on March 8, when he ran in Republican primaries on Super Tuesday.
Robertson officially remains a contender for the Republican
presidential nomination, although George Bush is expected to amass
sufficient delegates to clinch the nomination in today's
Pennsylvania primary.
   U.S. District Judge Joyce Hens Green dismissed the lawsuit on
the condition that Robertson pay McCloskey's court costs because
the former congressman is the prevailing party.
   McCloskey had sought $42,845 in court costs following the
dismissal last month of Robertson's $35 million libel action. But
the clerk of the U.S. District Court here rejected $14,845 of that
amount.
   ``We are pleased that even at the clerk level it was knocked
down substantially from $42,000 down to $28,000,'' said Joel E.
Leising, one of Robertson's attorneys.
   McCloskey's lawyer, George Lehner, said he was pleased with the
award.
   Robertson's lawyers, who had originally argued their client
should only be assessed $6,000, have five days to file further
objections with the judge.
   ``We will consider whether to seek a further reduction,''
Leising said, noting that ``at some point, the cost of legal fees
in seeking a reduction might outweigh what we would get.''
   The clerk disallowed more than $7,000 in fees for an expert
witness McCloskey had hired to rebut Robertson's claims that he
suffered economic hardship as a result of the statements, which
were contained in a letter to Rep. Andrew Jacobs, D-Ind.
   The letter was printed by several syndicated columnists,
prompting the libel suit.

   A lawyer awarded $21 million for four years
of confinement and torture in Argentine prisons during the military
regime says he'll donate half the money to other victims of human
abuses there.
   U.S. District Judge Samuel Conti on Monday ordered former
Argentine Gen. Carlos Suarez Mason, who supervised the prisons, to
pay the money, described by plaintiff lawyers as a record for human
rights abuse cases settled in the United States.
   On Wednesday, another federal judge is scheduled to decide
whether Suarez Mason should be extradited to Argentina on charges
of 43 murders and 24 kidnappings allegedly committed by soldiers
under his command.
   ``It's a tremendous victory both for human rights and for the
people of Argentina, the victims and the families of the
disappeared, to whom a great portion of this award will be
donated,'' David Cole, an attorney for the New York-based Center
for Constitutional Rights, said of Monday's ruling.
   Cole's client, Horacio Martinez-Baca, a labor union lawyer and
former government official in Mendoza, Argentina, said he was
arrested in March 1976, six days after a military coup, held for
four years and tortured repeatedly in military prisons overseen by
Suarez Mason.
   ``They laid me down on a table,'' Martinez-Baca, who now lives
in Oakland, testified last month. ``They tied my arms and legs.
They put electric shocks on my genitals and my gums, and they asked
who were my friends.''
   He also described beatings, freezing showers, death threats and
solitary confinement in an unheated, windowless cell for days at a
time.
   He said 90-minute torture sessions occurred about a month after
he was arrested and repeated several times before his release in
April 1980.
   Suarez Mason, whom prisoners referred to as ``the lord of death
and life,'' intervened personally in 1977 to block Martinez-Baca's
release from prison, according to Martinez-Baca.
   The judge on Monday held Suarez Mason in default after he failed
to respond to the lawsuit. Conti awarded Martinez-Baca $1.17
million for lost income, $10 million for pain and suffering and $10
million as punitive damages.
   Martinez-Baca agreed to give half the award to a fund for
victims of rights abuses in Argentina. Cole said plaintiffs in two
other pending civil suits in San Francisco that each seek $20
million against Suarez Mason have made the same agreement.
   The 64-year-old defendant has insisted he spent his last
$100,000 on lawyers in his extradition case and has no money left.
   Lawyers for Martinez-Baca, however, doubted that.
   ``This is someone who is alleged to have taken many millions of
dollars when he was in a position fo power in Argentina,'' said
attorney Joanne Hoeper. ``He paid his attorneys $100,000 in wire
transfers from Argentina and we're sure there's more where that
came from.''
   The damages can be collected against Suarez Mason's assets
anywhere in the world.
   Suarez Mason commanded the First Army Corps in Buenos Aires from
1976 to 1979. He fled when a civilian government came to power in
1983 and was arrested in January 1987 at his home in Foster City,
south of San Francisco.
   An estimated 9,000 to 20,000 suspected leftist sympathizers
vanished during the military regime from 1976 to 1983.
   Cole, whose non-profit legal organization has handled other
human rights cases, said the highest previous award was $10.4
million in 1984 to relative of a youth who was tortured and
murdered in Paraguay. The money was never paid because the
defendant, a police chief, had no assests that could be collected.

<HEAD>Reagan Extends Nicaragua Sanctions, Congressmen Object</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan is extending economic
sanctions against Nicaragua, over the objections of a group of
Democratic House members who say he should be helping the peace
process rather than punishing Nicaraguans.
   The White House announced the move Monday, saying Nicaragua's
Sandinista government still poses ``an unusual and extraordinary
threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United
States.''
   If Reagan had not made the formal announcement of a one-year
extention, with publication in the Federal Register, the sanctions
he imposed in 1985 would have lapsed on May 1.
   Reagan signed an executive order on May 1, 1985, cutting off all
trade with the Central American country, denying Nicaraguan
airliners and flag vessels access to the United States and ending a
27-year U.S.-Nicaraguan friendship treaty. Reagan cited
``aggressive actions'' by Nicaragua and its close military ties
with Cuba and the Soviet Union.
   The United States, however, has maintained diplomatic relations
with Nicaragua, while supporting Contra forces trying to overthrow
the government of President Daniel Ortega.
   Democratic Reps. Mike Lowry of Washington, Nancy Pelosi of
California, Don Bonker of Washington and George Crockett of
Michigan had been organizing an effort to lift the embargo,
gathering signatures for a letter to the president.
   Lowry said Reagan should ``stop punishing the Nicaraguan people
and start pushing the peace process.''
   ``The Nicaraguan embargo has worked against U.S. interests from
the beginning,'' he said in a statement released by his office. He
said it has discouraged the private sector in Nicaragua, brought
severe criticism from other Latin American and Western European
countries, harmed U.S. business and labor interests ``and increased
the suffering of innocent civilians in Nicaragua.''
   Lowry introduced legislation last week to lift the trade and
other economic sanctions against Nicaragua.
   ``If the Nicaraguan emergency were allowed to lapse,'' Reagan's
letter said, ``the present Nicaraguan trade controls would also
lapse, impairing our government's ability to apply economic
pressure on the Sandinista government and reducing the
effectiveness of our support for the forces of the democratic
opposition in Nicaragua.''

   Here is a brief look at the parties and issues in today's
election:
   CANDIDATES: 1,045 for 224 seats in single-member districts.
Another 75 seats in the 299-member National Assembly will be
decided according to the parties' nationwide vote proportions.
Winners will serve four years.
   MAJOR PARTIES: President Roh Tae-woo's Democratic Justice Party;
the Reunification Democratic Party of Kim Young-sam; the Party for
Peace and Democracy, which split with Reunification to back rival
opposition leader Kim Dae-jung's bid for the presidency in last
December's elections; the New Democratic Republican Party of former
Prime Minister Kim Jong-pil.
   FORMER ASSEMBLY: Elected in February 1985, it had 276 seats,
with the Democratic Justice Party holding 160, the Reunification
Democratic Party 55, the Party for Peace and Democracy 24, and the
New Democratic Republican Party 8, with the rest held by
independents or splinter groups. Roh won a five-year term in the
December presidential election with 36 percent of the vote as the
opposition vote was mainly split between the two main opposition
parties.
   ISSUES: Roh's party says it must win to ensure stability for
continued progress in the economy and democratic reforms announced
by Roh last summer as the governing party chairman. It accuses the
opposition of fomenting unrest. The opposition says a governing
party victory will bring more of the authoritarian rule and
corruption experienced under the administration of former President
Chun Doo-hwan. Chun's younger brother has been arrested in an
embezzlement scandal.
   VOTERS: 26.2 million registered. Voting hours were 7 a.m. to 6
p.m. at 13,812 polling stations.

<HEAD>House Approves Penalties for Genocide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House action has taken the United States on
its way to becoming a full participant in international agreements
aimed at preventing genocide.
   By a voice vote, the House on Monday approved largely symbolic
legislation setting stiff penalties for the crime of genocide. The
legislation, which is backed by the Reagan administration, must
also be ratified by the Senate.
   Although the International Convention on the Prevention and
Punishment of the Crime of Genocide was adopted by the United
Nations General Assembly and signed by the United States in 1948,
it was not ratified by the Senate until 1986.
   The international accords are aimed at preventing and punishing
attempts to destroy, in whole or in major part, a national, ethnic,
religious, racial or religious group.
   Since the convention itself contains no mechanism to punish
violators, the nations which have signed and ratified it it are
required to pass anti-genocide laws.
   Reagan administration officials contend that full implementation
of U.S. participation in the genocide convention will remove an
international human rights embarrassment.
   A report on the bill issued by the House Judiciary Committee
quoted Assistant Secretary of State Richard Schifter on the U.S.
position:
   ``Most of us will agree that genocide is not likely to take
place within the borders of the United States,'' Schifter said.
``Our action on this convention is above all a symbolic act.
   ``It underlines our role of leadership in the free world on
behalf of the cause of human rights.''
   The bill sets prison sentences ranging from 20 years to life for
people convicted of such offenses and sets fines of up to $1
milliion.
   It also provides for a prison term of up to five years and a
fine of up to $500,000 for people convicted of inciting others to
undertake acts of genocide.
   Those penalties would apply to crimes of genocide committed by
U.S. nationals or which are committed within the United States.
   The legislation also suspends the statute of limitations for
prosecutions on allegations of genocide.

   DeAndra Anrig, the 8-year-old ``kite

month, still has her head in the clouds, her mother says.
   ``It's amazing. The (attention) still hasn't died down,'' said
Debbie Anrig. ``This child has just eaten it up.''
   On March 20, DeAndra was flying her 12-foot kite at Shoreline
Park in Mountain View when a plane landing at Palo Alto Airport
caught the kite's 200-pound test line and carried the child 10 feet
into the air. She flew for 100 feet, let go as she approached a
clump of trees and fell to the ground, sustaining minor injuries.
   Since then, talk shows keep discussing her adventure and stories
have appeared in newspapers nationwide.
   Fan mail also continues to pour in from all over the country.
DeAndra _ or Andi, as family and friends call her _ is so
well-known that some of it is delivered without an address.
   ``All it says is DeAndra Anrig, Dublin, Calif.,'' Mrs. Anrig
said. ``The postman knows who it is.'' Some letters, she says, are
addressed to ``The Kite Crusader'' and ``The Little Flying Girl.''
   The only bad thing is that Andi's 4-year-old brother, Dean,
feels a little left out, Mrs. Anrig said. But the Anrigs have
promised him a kite of his own.
   Andi herself plans to fly kites again, but not near airplanes.

<TEXT>
   When Prime Minister Brian Mulroney visits
Washington for his summit with President Reagan, he'll be keeping
an eye on the results of a provincial election back home.
   Mulroney, who arrives in Washington tonight, is trying to decide
soon when to call a federal election. The choice of a new
government today in Manitoba, a blue-collar industrial province in
central Canada, may show the way.
   Manitoba has been controlled by the socialist New Democratic
Party for 15 of the past 19 years, but all polls indicate
Mulroney's Progressive Conservative Party will win the election,
after narrowly losing to the socialists in 1986.
   Mulroney has 16 months to go in his five-year term, but it is
traditional for Canadian leaders to set an early election date when
political omens are favorable. In a weekend interview, Mulroney
said he wanted to clear his government's legislative agenda before
calling a ballot.
   That agenda includes ratification of a comprehensive Free Trade
Agreement negotiated with the United States last year, passage of
the Meech Lake constitutional accord recognizing Quebec as a
French-speaking ``distinct society,'' a child day care program and
the privatization of Air Canada.
   The FreeTrade Agreement will be discussed at the Washington
summit. The U.S. Congress is expected vote on it this summer, while
the House of Commons will consider legislation on the agreement
next month.
   Recently, Mulroney has been making campaign-like stops around
the country to test the political waters.
   His 48-hour Washington visit includes a host of photo
opportunities including a 19-gun salute at the White House and
separate meetings with Reagan, Secretary of State George Shultz,
Vice President George Bush and leaders of both the House and Senate.
   On Wednesday afternoon, he is to address both houses of Congress.
   A former lawyer and corporate executive from Quebec, Mulroney,
49, has devoted much of his term to repairing Canada-U.S. relations
strained under former Liberal Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.
   Despite Reagan's reluctance to clean up U.S. smokestack
emissions causing acid rain north of the border, he and Mulroney
agree on key trade and defense issues. According to White House
officials, Reagan spends more time talking with Mulroney on the
telephone than any other world leader.
   Domestically, Mulroney has had a stormy time in office in spite
of the 140-seat majority he won four years ago in the 282-member
House of Commons.
   He has lost eight Cabinet members in scandals ranging from a
defense minister who visited a German strip club to a transport
minister tried for fraud.
   Mulroney has shepherded Canada's economy to the fastest growth
among major industrialized countries, with 4 percent inflation and
unemployment at a 6{-year low of 7.8 percent. Now the Conservatives
are now neck-and-neck in the polls with the Liberals and New
Democrats.
   Mulroney nevertheless has a credibility problem and is liked by
only about one-third of the electorate, according to polls.
   In contrast, New Democratic Party leader Ed Broadbent gets high
marks as Canada's most admired politician. Mulroney dubs his
nemesis ``perfection personified.''
   ``I don't know if I'll ever close in on perfection,'' the prime
minister said. ``But I don't have to, to win an election.''
   He said when the time comes, voters will not take a chance by
electing what would be the country's first socialist government at
a federal level.
   Broadbent's vulnerable spot is his party's vow to pull Canada
out of the NATO alliance and to renegotiate the NORAD air defense
pact with the United States.
   Canada was a charter member of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and has 6,900 troops stationed in West Germany.
Mulroney and Reagan agreed in 1986 to renew the North American
Aerospace Defense pact for five years, protecting the continent
against Soviet attack over the North Pole.
   The New Democrats would bring the troops home and cancel
Mulroney's $6.5 billion plan to acquire Canada's first fleet of
nuclear-powered submarines.
   Aware of the unpopularity of its NATO pledge, the New Democratic
Party softened its stance this month by promising not to start the
withdrawal in a first term.
   Mulroney ridiculed the change, saying Canadians would never
support ``a policy that says we're going to pull out of our most
sovereign undertaking with regard to national defense, but by the
way, we're not going to do it right now.''

<DATELINE>HAVANA, Cuba (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the heat of the Havana day, La Bodeguita
del Medio resembles the steamy cantinas of Mexico, with a bit of
the Big Apple thrown in.
   Like New York's Cadillac Bar, the walls are covered with
graffiti left by visitors who pack the cramped restaurant tucked
along a side street of Old Havana. Like the cafes of Tijuana, a
sweating chef stirs metal tubs of pork and beans, swatting at an
occasional fly and wiping his brow with a dishcloth.
   But there's a difference. Here, above the din of clattering
plates and the strum of the strolling guitarist, you're as apt to
hear German, Italian, French and English being spoken as you are to
hear Spanish. It's a sound the government loves to hear.
   With its Caribbean climate and calm beaches, Cuba, is a natural
lure for tourists. Before the revolution, U.S. visitors plunked
down millions of dollars in the cabarets and casinos of Havana.
   The casinos are closed now and tourists from the United States
vanished when relations soured between the two countries. U.S.
tourists who spend money in Cuba are subject to prosecution under
the U.S. Trading with the Enemy Act.
   The communist island nation, largely dependent on Soviet aid and
sugar exports, is making an all-out effort to bring in money from
elsewhere.
   From the bustle of Havana to the serene beaches of Santiago de
Cuba, the government is putting up new hotels and renovating old
ones in hopes of making tourism its No. 2 earner of hard currency,
after sugar, by the year 2000.
   Numbers are hard to come by _ nobody at the National Tourism
Institute, Intur, would talk to an American reporter.
   But Intur's vice president, Orosman Quintero, recently told
Cuban reporters that in 1987, about 123,000 people from Canada,
Spain, Italy, West Germany and Mexico visited Cuba. That was an
increase of 15 percent over 1986.
   According to the magazine Bohemia, Intur figures from 1986
indicate that 155,795 tourists visited Cuba, bringing in about
$97.3 million.
   Before the revolution, tourism brought in about $400 million
annually.
   The Canadian tourism season runs from December through the end
of March. But a few could still be found lounging in the 85 degree
sun last week at Santa Maria del Mar, a seaside resort 20 miles
outside Havana.
   Adelaide and Tony Aloi of Toronto said they paid $1,000 each for
two weeks in Santa Maria, including breakfast and dinner in their
hotel and round-trip airfare. Like others interviewed, they praised
beaches, weather, Cuban hospitality and the feeling of security.
   ``Mexico's cheap, but you have to bargain your way through it,''
said Aloi. ``Here, there's nobody coming up to you on the street
trying to sell things or get money.''
   But they agreed with other tourists who complained about bad
hotel food, the poor quality of consumer goods and hotel service
that is not up to par with other vacation spots.
   At the high-rise Havana Libre in the capital, the plumbing was
iffy and there was rarely hot water. It wasn't unusual to wait 10
minutes for an elevator, and no one was there to offer assistance
when the small refrigerator in one reporter's room started burning
one night.
   ``I personally wouldn't come back because I like to shop, and
there's nothing much to buy,'' said Susan McNulty of Toronto,
interviewed at the Hotel Atlantico in Santa Maria. ``But this is
the place to come if you just want a nice, relaxing vacation.''
   Intur says it is trying to improve things for tourists by
renovating older hotels, such as the 30-year-old Havana Libre, and
putting up new ones in areas such as Santa Maria, Santiago and
Varadero, the island's most popular tourist spot.
   An airport is being built at Varadero so visitors won't have to
drive the two hours north from Havana's airport, and 10 more hotels
are scheduled for completion by 1990. In the capital, 11 hotels are
under some form of renovation, according to the Intur magazine Sol
de Cuba.
   The Sun Channel, the television station for tourists, offers
news, movies and a morning aerobics program in English and Spanish.
Last week's feature films included ``Love at First Bite,'' ``A Man
and a Woman,'' and ``Sahara.''
   Intur also is offering prizes to lure foreigners. Sol de Cuba
heralded the arrival of a Silvia Proehl, the 100,000th West German
to visit Cuba over the past four years. She won a free week in Cuba
next year.

   Michael Dukakis won the Utah presidential
caucuses on Monday, overwhelming rival Jesse Jackson and capturing
most of the state's 23 delegates to the Democratic National
Convention.
   With 46 percent of the state's 75 legislative districts
reporting, Dukakis had 4,104 votes for 71 percent to Jackson's
1,080 or 19 percent, while 538 voters, or 9 percent, were
uncommitted.
   Based on these returns, Dukakis would win 18 national convention
delegates and Jackson would win five.
   The combined votes for Democrats Paul Simon, Richard Gephardt
and Albert Gore Jr. totaled 1 percent.
   The percentage of votes determines how many of the state's 23
delegates each candidate receives. The delegates will not be
elected until the state convention in June.
   Complete statewide returns were not expected until early Tuesday
from the balloting in separate caucus meetings held in nearly all
of the state's 1,807 voting districts.
   Although a victory here would reap only a handful of delegates,
Dukakis aides said it would give the Massachusetts governor
momentum heading into Tuesday's Pennsylvania primary.
   While Democrats declared their presidential preference,
Republicans were attending their own caucus meetings to vote their
preference for vice president and to say whether they want a
western states regional primary similar to the South's Super
Tuesday contests on March 8.
   Republicans had planned a non-binding presidential preference
vote, but scrapped the idea after Vice President George Bush
virtually wrapped up the nomination.
   Utah will send 28 delegates to the Democratic national
convention, including five ``super delegates'' chosen as a result
of present or past party office.
   Three of the superdelegates _ national committeewoman Norma
Matheson, Rep. Wayne Owens and state party chairman Randy Horiuchi
_ have endorsed Dukakis. The other two are uncommitted.
   Dukakis also has the endorsement of Matheson's husband, former
Democratic Gov. Scott Matheson.
   None of the candidates has visited Utah personally, but the
Dukakis campaign has maintained the strongest presence with a
full-time staff.
   Support for Jackson is more difficult to gauge. Two es here are picking
up momentum. Jackson will
pick up some delegates,'' Horiuchi predicted.
   Traditionally between 8 percent and 12 percent of registered
voters attend the Utah caucuses.

   Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson differed
Monday over whether any concessions should be made to terrorists
holding Americans hostage, while a new survey said Dukakis appeared
headed for another big-state presidential primary victory in
Pennsylvania.
   ``You never make concessions to terrorists _ ever,'' Dukakis
told reporters during a final campaign swing across the state
before Tuesday's primary.
   Jackson rejected what he called ``material concessions'' to
terrorists but did not rule out political accommodation. He also
said he could conceive of situations where he would grant safe
passage to hostage-takers and added, ``I choose negotiation over
blind bloody confrontation.''
   ``If we are going to deter terrorism, we must address the
underlying causes of terrorism,'' he said after an appearance at a
high school in Pittsburgh. ``Terrorism does not emerge out of the
blue.''
   The candidates agreed that in hostage situations, the government
ought to talk to people who could bring about the release of
persons being held.
   U.S. policy holds that American officials ``will talk to any
official or group about the safety and release of hostages but we
will not make concessions,'' according to the State Department.
   But Jackson insisted, ``The fact is tha our government has
talked with terrorists and has negotiated, in some instances
successfully. It is good as a policy, but there must be always
flexibility in the policy. ... We ought to take every initiative we
can to gain the freedom of the American hostages in Beirut.''
   Eight Americans are held hostage by Moslem extremists in Beirut.
   The discussion of tactics for dealing with terrorists was an
abrupt shift in a campaign debate which had been focused on
economic issues, particularly how to assist Pennsylvania's ailing
steel industry.
   Jackson wound up his Pennsylvania campaign in Philadelphia where
he spoke to striking workers at a British Petroleum Corp. refinery,
attended a reception with gay and lesbian activists and then held a
get-out-the-vote rally.
   At the refinery, he said the company's profits were up 400
percent last year.
   ``For profits to be up and wages down is greedy and unfair,'' he
said.
   He also linked the welfare of American workers to the status of
blacks in South Africa.
   ``Steelworkers in Pennsylvania are in danger as long as
ironworkers in South Africa are enslaved,'' he said. Referring to
imprisoned South African black leader Nelson Mandela, Jackson said,
``Until Mandela is free, you will not be free.''
   Dukakis was aiming for his fourth straight primary victory in a
contest with 178 delegates at stake.
   Vice President George Bush, who could clinch a convention
majority with a victory in Pennsylvania, compared his campaign
rebirth after an Iowa caucus defeat to the revival of Pittsburgh, a
once-strapped steel town.
   ``I know what it's like to be knocked to the canvas,'' he said,
adding that his political comeback was ``a parallel to what you
demonstrated here.''
   The latest Associated Press delegate count gave Bush 1,081 _ 58
short of the 1,139 needed for the nomination at the GOP convention
next August. His only remaining rival, former television evangelist
Pat Robertson, has 31 delegates.
   On the Democratic side, Dukakis was more than half way toward a
delegate majority, holding 1,075.15 national convention votes.
Jackson has 836.1 while 599.75 were uncommitted. A tally of 2,081
or more is needed to win the nomination at the July convention in
Atlanta.
   Dukakis' strong victory in the New York primary last week made
him the prohibitive favorite to emerge as the Democratic
presidential nominee.
   A new poll sponsored by Philadelphia's KYW-TV and Pittsburgh's
KDKA-TV indicated a big Dukakis win here, with the Massachusetts
governor the choice of 57 percent of the likely Democratic voters
surveyed compared to 31 percent for Jackson.
   Dukakis, meanwhile, won a large majority of the 23 delegates at
stake in caucuses Monday night in Utah. With 46 percent of the
state's legislative districts reporting, Dukakis had 71 percent of
the vote to Jackson's 19 percent.
   The flap over how to deal with terrorists began on Sunday when
Jackson took issue with Dukakis' position.
   ``I've raised the point in several debates this year,'' said
Jackson ``Every time a question comes up about terrorism, Mr.
Dukakis says, `I'm against terrorism. ... We should not negotiate
with terrorists. ... In the Middle East, never negotiate with
terrorists.'
   ``I disagree with that; If I could get the hostages out, I'd do
it.''
   When Dukakis was asked Monday about the Jackson statement, he
said, ``I think we need a tough anti-terrorist policy.
   ``I don't have a problem with talking, but you never make
concessions to terrorists _ ever. If you do, what you end up with
is hostage-taking and terrorism all over the world.''
   Jackson said that as president he would not talk directly to
terrorists because ``it would effectively raise the status of the
terrorists and that would be a stimulus and that should not
happen.''
   He went on to say that ``talk does not mean material
concessions.''
   He said, ``I would never, never exchange arms for hostages,'' a
reference to the secret arms sales to Iran by the Reagan
administration. ``That was a fundamental mistake.''
   Asked what he meant by material concessions, Jackson said,
``Well, you're giving something physical. The first principle is
that we should not jeopardize our national interests or national
security.''
   Pressed on whether he would exchange political prisoners for
hostages, Jackson said, ``Well, the other government must make that
judgment. They must weigh their political circumstances, they must
determine the consequences of such an act. Every plea bargain
situation or right of safe passage situation must be weighed on its
own merits.''
   Meanwhile, a Gallup poll released Monday evening had Bush and
Dukakis virtually tied in a head-to-head race, with Bush doing
better with the addition of Rep. Jack Kemp as a running mate and
Dukakis a bit worse if he ran with Jackson.
   Bush had 45 percent support to 43 percent for Dukakis, with 12
percent undecided or favoring someone else. A Bush-Kemp ticket won
the support of 50 percent, against 40 percent for a Dukakis-Jackson
ticket, with 10 percent in the other-undecided category.
   With Jackson as the Democratic presidential nominee, the result
was Bush 60 percent, Jackson 25, other-undecided 15. Gallup
surveyed 1,204 registered voters April 21-23; the poll had a margin
of sampling error of 3 points.
   Among the 540 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents in
the poll, 66 percent favored Dukakis as the party's nominee to 22
percent who wanted Jackson and 12 percent other-undecided. About
two-thirds of Jackson's support was strong, compared to one-third
of Dukakis' support.

   The Associated Press will speed its DataStream
news delivery service to about 9,000 words a minute and increase
its domestic news staff to deal with what its president calls the
``the new world of news.''
   The increase to 9,000 words a minute begins in June, and the AP
also will offer new photo and graphic services, AP President Louis
D. Boccardi told publishers and newspaper editors Monday at the
annual AP meeting.
   The news cooperative also will add 10 to 15 domestic news
staffers in 1988 to better serve the AP's 1,423 newspaper members,
he said.
   ``The bulk of these will go to our line bureaus, whose state and
regional news coverage is so important to you,'' he told the
members. ``With membership increasing as it has, the demands on our
state bureaus are increasing. And we must meet those needs.''
   The worldwide news cooperative is about to move from a speed of
about 1,050 words a minute to about 9,000 on its DataStream and
DataFeature wires. DataStream is the AP high-speed news wire.
DataFeature is a separate service that delivers supplemental and
syndicate copy to member newspapers throughout the system.
   For newspapers with systems that need slower speeds, the
delivery can be reduced, but the higher capacity will avoid
crowding that can slow the delivery of copy, much like traffic
clogs a highway.
   ``We are raising the speed limit from 55 miles per hour to 440
miles per hour, and, if that weren't enough, we're widening the AP
interstate from four lanes to eight,'' Boccardi said.
   A new AP electronic darkroom for large newspapers already is
serving three members. In June the AP will unveil a PC-based
electronic darkroom designed for smaller newspapers, Boccardi said.
   After the meeting, the AP held its annual luncheon with Texas
billionaire H. Ross Perot as the keynote speaker. Perot, 57, is the
founder of Electronic Data Systems and financed the rescue of two
of his employees who were held hostage in Iran in 1978.
   The luncheon was held on the first day of the three-day 102nd
Annual Convention of the American Newspaper Publishers Association.
   The financier and philanthropist told the more than 1,500 people
at the luncheon that business leaders, not politicians, hold much
of the blame for the United States' declining status in the world.
   Since the U.S. economy depends on tax-paying workers, business
leaders should work harder to create more jobs, Perot said.
   Perot said other countries, especially in the Asia-Pacific
region, are outpacing the United States in education, trade and
technology.
   He said that before the federal government can cure the huge
budget deficit, individual Americans must learn not to spend more
than they earn.
   ``The greatest nation in the history of civilization has given
up trying to live within its means,'' he said. ``We and not the
elected officials are the dwarfs and the wimps.''
   Before the luncheon, five AP correspondents shared their
experiences in a panel discussion called ``The World's Hotspots: A
Firsthand View.''
   Also at the meeting, Donald E. Newhouse of The (Newark, N.J.)
Star-Ledger, and Katherine W. Fanning of The Christian Science
Monitor were elected to the board of directors of The Associated
Press, and four incumbent directors were re-elected.
   James H. Ottaway Jr. of The Times Herald-Record of Middletown,
N.Y.; Robert C. Maynard of The Tribune of Oakland, Calif.; James E.
Burgess of the Wisconsin State Journal in Madison; and Edwin L.
Heminger of The Courier in Findlay, Ohio, were elected to new
three-year terms on the board.
   Directors were elected from among 12 nominees at the AP annual
meeting.
   Newhouse and Ms. Fanning were chosen to succeed retiring
directors John F. McGee of the Charleston (W. Va.) Daily Mail and
Robert G. Marbut of the Corpus Christi (Texas) Caller-Times, who
had served the maximum of three three-year terms on the board.
   Newhouse is president of The Star-Ledger, and of Advance
Publications Inc. and Newhouse Broadcasting Co. He is a director of
the American Newspaper Publishers Association.
   Ms. Fanning is editor of the Monitor, published in Boston, and
is immediate past president of the American Society of Newspaper
Editors.
   The voting for directors was based on membership bonds held by
the newspapers that make up the cooperative news agency.
   Heminger was re-elected to the board to represent a city of
under 50,000 population.
   AP bylaws require that there be at least three directors
representing newspapers published in cities of less than 50,000
population.

   The Tokyo stock market closed at a record high
Tuesday while the U.S. dollar weakened.
   In the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
closed at 27,246.77, 33.32 points higher than on Monday. The
market's main barometer briefly reached the all time high of
27,339.14 shortly after Tuesday's opening, but profit-taking
thwarted the early morning rally, traders said.
   Meanwhile, the dollar closed at 124.57 yen, 0.43 yen lower than
Monday's close of 125. It opened at 124.65 yen and traded in a
narrow range of 124.55 yen to 124.70 yen, traders said.
   Analysts said initial bullish sentiment in the stock market
following the record close on Monday pushed stock prices up in
early trading, but the trend slowly reversed, fueled by
profit-taking.
   ``The market started out on a bullish note, but then ran out of
gas and started moving down,'' said a trader at a major securities
firm, who asked not to be identified.

   A 5-year-old boy has realized his dream
of attending school before he dies of AIDS. He began his first day
of preschool by telling his classmates about his fatal disease and
his ``bad blood.''
   The boy, whose breathing is aided by an oxygen tank, surprised
his mother by volunteering the information as his seven classmates
introduced themselves, his mother said Monday.
   ``He said `This is my oxygen, and I have a disease. My bad blood
could kill you,''' said the mother, Shiela, who took her son
Jonathan on Monday to the special education class at Patterson
Elementary School.
   ``He didn't wait for anything. And the kids responded really
well,'' the mother said at a news conference outside her
condominium in this Denver suburb.
   ``He broke the ice right off and from then on it was just normal
kid stuff,'' said Shiela, a divorced mother of three other sons.
   She has asked that her last name not be published because she
fears retaliation against her family.
   ``They listened and they played with me,'' Jonathan said of the
hour he spent in the classroom. Asked whether his first day was as
much fun as he expected, he replied, ``Yeah.''
   Shiela said her son's biggest dream has been to attend school
before he dies.
   ``He used to talk about dying all the time and he said he wanted
to die,'' she said as Jonathan watched ants inching along the
sidewalk. ``But he hasn't addressed it since he found out he would
get to go to school. He hasn't mentioned it in the last couple of
weeks.''
   As his mother talked with reporters, Jonathan showed off a
Polaroid picture of himself at school. At one point, he walked away
to play on the sidewalk, unhooking the tube that connected him with
the oxygen tank.
   Jonathan's hopes of going to school were blocked several times
in the past year by one delay after another. Earlier this month, a
tutor assigned by the school district to teach him at home demanded
to be reassigned, threatening to file a lawsuit if forced to
continue the tutoring. The request was granted.
   School officials decided April 19 to allow Jonathan to attend
class.
   Jonathan is Colorado's first recorded child victim of the fatal
disease, said his mother. The youngster contracted AIDS from
tainted blood he received in a transfusion shortly after birth and
was diagnosed in June 1985.
   ``One thing that sticks in my mind, he used to say `Jesus
doesn't listen to me. ... I told Him to come and get me, and He
didn't.' It really rips your heart out, but I think in a way he's
comforting me by telling me it's all right with him. He was
diagnosed three years ago, and it's just a matter of time.''
   Pam Mills, executive director of exceptional students' services
for Jefferson County Schools, also attended the news conference and
said she was unaware of any parents who had kept their children at
home because of Jonathan. There were no protesters or parents
outside the school Monday.
   Mills said parents of the other students had prepared their
children.
   ``We have met with the parents a couple of times,'' she said.
``It's basically a health and hygiene type of issue with them.''
   Jonathan eventually will attend class 10 hours a week and his
progress will be evaluated in May and in August.
   Shiela also plans to enroll Jonathan in summer classes. ``He has
such a limited time in school.''

   News coverage of the Soviet Union is more
difficult now because there is more activity and thus more news to
report, according to Michael Putzel, The Associated Press bureau
chief in Moscow.
   ``Now we cover dissident news conferences, official news
conferences, and demonstrations,'' he said. ``We are getting a lot
more information.
   ``For Soviet reporters, it's a whole new ballgame,'' Putzel
said. ``They now have to firgure out what's expected of them and
how far they can and want to go.''
   Putzel and four other AP correspondents and news executives
discussed reporting conditions and press freedoms, among other
topics, during a conversation with AP President Louis D. Boccardi
at The Associated Press annual meeting here Monday.
   The press is one of the most distinct areas of liberalization in
South Korea, said Barry Renfrew, AP chief of bureau in Seoul.
   ``The press is able to moderately criticize the government
now,'' he said.
   ``There has been a change from direct intimidation to more
subtle influence,'' he said.
   ``Current riots in the West Bank and Gaza Strip have posed
difficult problems for the Israeli government, which is a democracy
and prides itself on being one,'' said Nick Tatro, the wire
service's bureau chief in Jerusalem.
   The government has not used military censorship but has tried to
close off stories by putting curfews on towns or declaring military
areas closed, he said.
   Bryna Brennan, Central America correspondent for the AP, noted
the reopening of La Prensa, a newspaper in Managua, Nicaragua, last
fall.
   ``La Prensa has published consistently since October except for
a brief week at Easter when they ran out of newsprint,'' she said.
   ``It is a very strong opposition newspaper.''
   Terence Hunt, the AP's chief White House correspondent, said he
has the same difficulties in getting access to people he needs to
talk with as the foreign correspondents do.
   ``We only have access to our own booth and to (White House Press
Secretary) Marlin Fitzwater's office, where the door is usually
closed,'' Hunt said.
   ``We can't get to the oval office, or (White House Chief of
Staff) Howard Baker's office or the senior staff without an
appointment,'' he said.
   ``It's almost impossible on a spot story to get a call through
for comment,'' he said. ``We have better luck talking to people on
Capitol Hill because (the) White House staff briefs congressional
leaders on major issues.''

   Mayor Sonny Bono, who rose to fame
singing ``I've Got You Babe'' with ex-wife Cher, now has his own
sonny after his wife gave birth to a baby boy.
   Bono's first son was born at 8:15 p.m. Monday and named Chesare
Elan, said Bono's spokeswoman Marilyn Baker. Chesare is Italian for
Caesar and Elan means spirit, Ms. Baker said.
   Both mother, Mary Bono, and baby were fine, Ms. Baker said.
   Bono, who stayed with his wife throughout the Caesarean section
delivery, was ``rocking the baby, showing it off to all the
relatives and giving it its first bottle,'' Ms. Baker said.
   The baby weighed 7 pounds, 13 ounces and had a full head of dark
hair, Ms. Baker said. ``He looks just like his daddy,'' she said.
   Bono, 53, has two daughters, Chastity, 19, whose mother is Cher,
and Christy, 30, from a previous marriage.
   Mrs. Bono, 26, is the fourth wife of the former mop-haired
singer-turned-restaurateur and politician.
   Bono was elected mayor of this desert resort, 110 miles east of
Los Angeles, on April 12, the day after Cher received an Academy
Award as best actress for her role in ``Moonstruck.''

   A school bus went careening out of
control after the driver suffered a fatal heart attack, but three
junior high school boys brought it to a halt after seeing the
driver topple from her seat.
   ``They are heroes,'' said Jack Cassidy, principal at Ralph Reed
Junior High School in Central Islip, Long Island.
   The full-size bus was carrying five youngsters to the school
Monday morning, threading through traffic on busy Route 111 at 15
mph, authorities said. It narrowly missed a car and a utility pole
when it veered left into oncoming traffic after the driver's heart
attack.
   ``We heard something fall. I looked out the window and saw the
bus heading for a car. I didn't know what happened,'' said Jack
Florival, 14, one of the boys who took over when driver Mary
Flammer, 48, of Holbrook, toppled from her seat.
   Florival and two 15-year-olds, Sean Mohan and Nigel Boyer, ran
forward from their seats in the rear.
   ``I grabbed the wheel,'' said Florival, ``Sean and Nigel slammed
on the brakes.''
   The bus mounted the curb and came to rest on the sidewalk in
front of a house. They boys went to the house for help but got no
response.
   ``We heard somebody inside but they wouldn't come to the door,''
said Florival. ``Then another school bus driver stopped and he
called police.''
   An ambulance took Flammer to a hospital where she was pronounced
dead, said police spokesman John Hayden.
   The driver had passed her last physical March 11, said Philip
DiDomenico, spokesman for her employer, the Suffolk Transportation
Co.
   Cassidy, told the youngsters he was going to write to President
Reagan, Gov. Mario Cuomo and the school board about their actions.
   Florival said his uncle had taught him to drive ``a little'' in
case of an emergency.
   ``I was frightened,'' he said, ``but God was with us.''

<HEAD>AIDS Issue Surfaces During Discussion On U.S. Bases In Philippines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and Filipino negotiators today
discussed AIDS and procedures for trying American troops in
criminal cases.
   The discussion occurred during talks on U.S. military bases
which sources described as difficult and emotional. The Senate is
debating a bill to ban nuclear weapons in the Philippines and to
prohibit nuclear-capable military ships from making port calls. The
measure is directed at U.S. military bases.
   In another development, at least seven people were killed today
on Mactan island during a gun battle between government troops and
Scout Rangers who deserted their unit. Three of the dead were Scout
Rangers and four were government soldiers, officials said. Radio
stations said a civilian also died.
   Also today, officials said communist rebels were suspected in
the killings of a police captain and an anti-communist vigilante in
two separate attacks near the U.S.-run Clark Air Base.
   After their discussion today, the U.S. and Filipino negotiators
released a joint statement saying they had discussed ``the criminal
jurisdiction issue'' and that the Philippine side presented its
proposal on purchases of locally manufactured products ``and
socio-economic issues.''
   There was no elaboration, but sources familiar with the talks
said the ``socio-economic issues'' referred to allegations that
U.S. troops had brought the deadly AIDS virus into the country.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the talks
were ``difficult'' and ``emotional.''
   At least 50 Filipino prostitutes have been found carrying the
AIDS virus but none has developed symptoms of the disease, which is
transmitted primarily through sexual intercourse or contaminated
needles and blood products.
   Most of those found with the virus work in bars near the
U.S.-run Clark Air Base and the Subic Bay naval base. U.S.
authorities have promised not to transfer troops carrying the virus
to the Philippines.
   Filipino officials have suggested that the United States finance
health and rehabilitation programs for AIDS-infected prostitutes
working near the bases.
   The current bases agreement exempts American servicemen from
trial by Filipino courts if they allegedly commit crimes while on
duty. Sources said Filipino negotiators believe American commanders
issue duty certificates to their troops too freely in a bid to
exempt them from trial by local courts.
   On April 5, the two sides began a periodic review of the 1947
agreement under which the United States maintains six military
bases in the Philippines.
   The outcome is expected to influence Manila's decision whether
to allow the bases to remain after their lease expires in 1991. But
the talks are taking place amid growing calls for closing the
bases, which many Filipinos see as a vestige of U.S. colonial rule.
President Corazon Aquino has promised to honor the agreement but
refuses to say whether she will support an extension.
   Under the new Filipino constitution, any extension must be
approved by two-thirds of the 23-member Senate, where opposition to
the bases is strong.
   On Monday, the Senate began debate on a bill to ban nuclear
weapons and nuclear-powered ships from the Philippines. U.S.
officials say about 40 percent of the warships that call at Subic
Bay are nuclear powered.
   The bill's sponsors say it is directed at the American bases.
U.S. officials refuse to say whether nuclear weapons are stored in
the Phillipines.
   Officials said the battle between government troops and Scout
Rangers began when the rangers attacked a checkpoint set up to
prevent them from moving from their hideout.
   About 30 members of the army's elite Scout Rangers deserted in
1986 and moved to Mactan, a small island where Cebu City's
international airport is located. The renegade rangers, who the
military claims have been involved in smuggling, formed a religious
cult that forbids bathing and cutting hair.
   In the Clark Air Base incidents, police said two men armed with
.45-caliber pistols shot and killed Capt. Francisco Medina, 41,
deputy police commander of Mabalacat, as he drove late Monday near
the base.
   Hours later, a lone gunman killed Francisco Sabile, 48, while he
played cards with friends in Angeles City. Sabile was a member of
the Angelino Simbulan Brigade, an anti-communist vigilante group.
   Clark Air Base, a sprawling military facility 50 miles north of
Manila, straddles the towns of Mabalacat and Angeles City. In
October rebels killed three Americans and a Filipino of U.S.
extraction in attacks outside the base.

   Bob and Anita Van Housen were looking for
someplace peaceful to spend their retirement when they moved to
this rural southern Oregon community two years ago from Southern
California.
   Instead, they find themselves fighting to keep a California
rapist who cut off the forearms of his victim from becoming their
neighbor.
   ``Unless you've got a gun or a large dog, you're very
vulnerable,'' said Mrs. Van Housen, president of the Cow Creek
Homeowners Association, as she petted her Doberman. ``We have a gun
and a good watchdog.''
   The object of their fear is Lawrence Singleton.
   The 60-year-old former merchant marine became a free man Monday
after serving eight years in prison and one year of parole for
raping and mutilating a 15-year-old girl he picked up hitchhiking
in Berkeley, Calif., then leaving her for dead outside Modesto.
   Though his whereabouts remain unknown since his release,
Singleton has said he wants to visit relatives in Florida, then
come to Azalea to live with members of a fundamentalist communal
sect called the Bride of Christ.
   Angry protests followed Singleton from town to town last year
when California officials tried to place him on parole. He was
finally put in a small trailer on the grounds of San Quentin prison
to complete his parole.
   Bride of Christ leader Pastor Thomas Clyde Smith Jr. offered
Singleton a home in this tiny rural community of about 750 people,
mostly millworkers, loggers, retirees and some ranchers.
   Since then, Smith says he and his followers have received death
threats and shots have been fired at their homes.
   ``I would like to see them hug each other,'' Smith said of
Singleton and his victim, Mary Vincent, who has been reported
living somewhere in southern Oregon. ``It takes two people to heal
a situation.
   ``I know in this environment where we live (Singleton) will have
an opportunity to see love,'' Smith added. ``Maybe he has never
seen it. I know I didn't until I got saved.''
   Smith was convicted of sexually abusing one of his daughters in
1965, and has been a controversial figure in Azalea since he and
his 60 followers moved here four years ago from Las Vegas, Nev.
   ``This isn't your little white church,'' Mrs. Van Housen said.
``Nobody in this community belongs to that church. It's a closed
church.''
   Though the state attorney general's office says it can do
nothing to stop Singleton from moving to Oregon, Rep. Denny Smith,
R-Ore., sent a letter this week to residents here, urging them to
attend a meeting Saturday in the Grange hall. Smith is the sponsor
of a state initiative to keep repeat offenders in prison for their
full terms.
   ``The reason he chose your town, no doubt, has a lot to do with
how attractive Oregon is to career criminals,'' the congressman
wrote.
   Mrs. Van Housen said she is particularly afraid for Azalea's
children.
   ``The man obviously has to live somewhere, but geographically,
this isn't the place,'' she said, pointing to the thick forests
surrounding the community. ``I know people who live in this area
and they have children who get off the school bus and walk a mile
through these woods.''
   Minister Smith said the children in his church are eager to meet
Singleton.
   ``In our church we don't teach fear to our children,'' he said.
``We want to show him love.''
   The tension has prompted the Douglas County Sheriff's Department
to increase patrols through Azalea.
   ``Even if Singleton did not show, that would not belay the
feelings down there toward Smith for making this invitation to
start with,'' said Undersheriff Ray Duncan. ``That one will be a
long time going away, if it ever does.''

<HEAD>Saudi Arabia To Sign Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALY MAHMOUD</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia today decided
to sign an international treaty limiting the spread of nuclear
arms, apparently responding to Israeli fears that the kingdom might
arm its missiles with nuclear warheads.
   Information Minister Ali al-Shaer said the decision was made
during a Cabinet meeting in the Saudi capital of Riyahd where other
issues also were discussed, the official Saudi Press Agency
reported.
   It appeared the announcement was designed primarily to reassure
the United States that Saudi Arabia will not try to put nuclear
warheads on CSS-2 intermediate-range missiles the kingdom acquired
from China.
   King Fahd wrote President Reagan recently reportedly assuring
him that the warheads on the surface-to-surface missiles are not
nuclear.
   Israel has alleged that the missiles constitute a threat to its
safety and indicated it might deal a preemptive strike to destroy
them.
   The news agency, monitored in Bahrain, said Prince Saud Faisal,
the Saudi foreign minister, recommended that the kingdom join the
International Nuclear Weapons Non-proliferation Treaty.
   Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter of crude oil, was
reported to have obtained from Beijing an undisclosed number of
CSS-2 missiles capable of reaching virtually any point in the
Middle East, including Israel.
   Western diplomatic sources have said that China, which arms its
own CSS-2s with atomic warheads, has told Washington it will not
export nuclear arms.
   The sources said the Saudis refused a request by the United
States to inspect the missiles, which they said were deployed in
the Rub al-Khali desert south of Riyadh.
   Saudi sources said Prince Sultan, the defense minister,
approached Beijing for the CSS-2s mainly because of U.S.
congressional obstruction of Reagan's approval of the sale of
certain types of weapons to the kingdom. They complained that
Congress has been bending to powerful Israeli lobbying against U.S.
arms sale to Saudi Arabia.
   The Saudis feel threatened by Iran, which in 1984 began using
intermediate-range missiles against its Persian Gulf war foe, Iraq.
   Saudi-Iranian relations hit their lowest point in July, when
hundreds of Iranian pilgrims tried to defy a ban on political
rallies and were killed in clashes with Saudi riot police in Mecca
during the annual pilgrimage season.
   Gulf-based Arab diplomatic sources have said the Saudis want the
CSS-2s as a potential deterrent to Iran, whose leadership has urged
the overthrow of the Saudi royal family.
   The United States, the Soviet Union and Britain were the major
signers when the nuclear non-proliferation treaty was adopted in
1968. In subsequent years the treaty was signed by scores of other
nations.
   The treaty is aimed at restricting the spread of military
nuclear technology. It calls for nuclear powers to abstain from
assisting non-nuclear nations in obtaining or making nuclear
weapons.

<HEAD>Wright: Jackson Has `Earned Right' to Vice Presidential

   House Speaker James Wright thinks Jesse
Jackson has ``earned the right'' to be considered as a vice
presidential candidate should he lose the presidential nomination
to Michael Dukakis.
   The Texas Democrat, on the Kansas State University campus to
deliver an Alf Landon Lecture, said at a news conference Monday he
remains neutral in the race for the party's presidential nomination.
   But he said Jackson has demonstrated his ``very broad appeal''
with voters and has matured since he tried for the Democratic
presidential nomination in 1984.
   ``I just think he's earned a right to be considered for some of
our highest offices,'' Wright said.
   He declined to predict the outcome of the Dukakis-Jackson race,
but said the Democrats probably won't have a brokered convention
when they meet this July in Atlanta.
   ``I think somebody will get a majority on the first ballot,''
Wright said.

<HEAD>Garry Trudeau Tells Publishers Of Growing Intolerance Of Free
Expression</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTINE DONNELLY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cartoonist Garry Trudeau told a convention of
newspaper publishers he does not object to newspapers editing his
often controversial ``Doonesbury'' strip.
   But, he added, the country seems more intolerant of free
expression than three years ago.
   Trudeau's strip runs in about 900 newspapers. He won a Pulitzer
Prize for editorial cartooning in 1975, becoming the first
comic-strip artist ever to do so.
   Editors have the right and the responsibility to cut material
they think is inappropriate for their readership, he said Monday.
   ``As you know, it's called editing, and those who call it
censorship are either careless or ignorant,'' Trudeau told about
2,000 people attending the 102nd Annual Convention of the American
Newspaper Publishers Association.
   But he said those who use the rationale that ``Doonesbury'' is
biased and unfair as the reason for pulling the strip are missing
the point.
   ``Satire is supposed to be unbalanced. It's supposed to be
unfair,'' he said. ``Criticizing a political satirist for being
unfair is like criticizing a 260-pound noseguard for being physical.
   ``We're all up against a very dangerous trend of intolerance
towards free expression,'' he said. ``Indeed, if ``Doonesbury'' has
sometimes seemed too pungent to some of you, it may be because it
appeared in an environment unfriendly to critical comment, a time
when impertinent questions are unwelcome.''
   Before Trudeau's speech, George W. Wilson, the chairman of the
ANPA and president of the Concord (N.H.) Monitor, delivered the
first keynote address of the three-day convention.
   Wilson said the industry needs to be more vigorous in its hiring
of minority journalists.
   ``Our staffs must reflect the diversity of our society and our
newspapers must faithfully mirror the world around us because we
are a unique business with extraordinary responsibilities,'' Wilson
said.
   Besides staff diversity and editorial excellence, the future of
the industry depends on technological research and development, he
said.
   ``Either technological developments will catch us unprepared _
and we can pray others are similarly surprised _ or we can
stimulate and shape technological developments to serve our
needs,'' he said.
   The convention's first panel discussion featured trade experts
who touched upon, among other things, the omnibus trade bill before
the Senate and the effect of foreign investment in the United
States.
   The bill, which President Reagan has promised to veto, could be
revised easily to his liking with its major provisions intact, said
Susan Liebeler, chairwoman of the U.S. International Trade
Commission.
   ``I think you're a bit premature in calling in the undertaker,''
she told fellow panelists discussing the bill.
   The bill passed the House 312-107 last week and is to be voted
on by the Senate this week.
   Reagan especially objects to a provision requiring most
manufacturers to give 60 days notice of plant closings and major
layoffs.
   Liebeler said she thought that Reagan would veto the bill and
that, in a revised version, the notification provision would be
dropped and the bill approved.
   More than 2,000 people, including about 1,500 publishers who
represent 90 percent of the daily newspaper circulation in the
United States, are attending the convention.
   Today's activities feature a panel discussion on the status of
minority journalists and a speech by Joseph Clark, principal of
Eastside High School in Paterson, N.J. Senior NBC News commentator
John Chancellor is to give a luncheon address.
   On Wednesday, the ANPA will conduct its annual business meeting,
including the election of its officers and directors.

   A strong earthquake today shook the
central region of the Adriatic Sea, the state news agency Tanjug
said. The quake was felt along the entire Adriatic coast, but no
damage or injuries were reported.
   The temblor struck shortly after midnight and measured 5.4 on
the Richter scale, according to the Yugoslav Federal Seismological
Institute.
   Tanjug said the epicenter of the quake was located near the
island of Palagruza in the middle of the Adriatic Sea off the
Hercegovina coast.
   The Richter scale is a guage of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A quake measuring 5 on the scale can cause
considerable damage.

<HEAD>Tokyo Stock Market Closes At Record High; Dollar Falls Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo stock market had a record high closing
today for the third consecutive day, while the U.S. dollar inched
down against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, the market's main index,
reached the all time high of 27,339.14 points immediately after
Tuesday's opening at 27,323.54. Then profit-taking thwarted the
early morning rally causing share prices dip at the close of the
morning session.
   Bullish sentiment in the market, however, drove the shares back
up to the day's opening level immediately after the start of the
afternoon session, and the market closed the day's trading at
27,246.77, or 33.32 points higher than Monday's close, another
record high.
   ``It was a typical first-day-of-the-month pattern,'' said a
trader for a Japanese securities firm, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   ``Major securities firms customerily push their sales on the
first day of the month,'' he added. ``So share prices usually jump
up in early morning and then profit-taking usually press it down a
bit.''
   Shares traded Tuesday will go into the May account.
   The trader added that the general trend is still upward, but
investors took ``wait-and-see attitude'' Tuesday ahead of the
release of gross national product figures in the United States for
the first quarter of 1988. This made the recovery of share prices
slower than usual.
   The American gross national product figures will be announced
today in Washington.
   Volume traded in the first section today was estimated at 1
billion shares.
   Meanwhile, the dollar opened at 124.65 yen in Tokyo and closed
at 124.57 yen, down 0.35 yen from Monday's close. It traded in a
narrow range of 124.55 yen to 124.70 yen throughout the day.
   ``The dollar sold in the 125's Monday, so it went back to a
comfortable level at around 124.60 yen. Now, it can not seem to be
able to go anywhere from there unless some influencing factors
emerge,'' said Hiroaki Shukuzawa of Sumitomo Bank. ``At this point,
124.55 - 124.70 yen seems to be the neutral range.''
   Shukuzawa, a currency dealer at one of the largest bank in
Japan, added that he expects no major effects from the U.S. gross
national product figures on exchange rates in Japan.
   ``GNP is not like a trade figure that has immediate effects on
exchange rates,'' he said. ``Its effects show up in a much longer
term.''

<HEAD>Prison Officials: Demjanjuk's Guards Put On Suicide Watch</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOCELYN NOVECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir today praised a
court for sentencing John Demjanjuk to death for Nazi war crimes.
   ``All of us are proud that a Jewish tribunal in the Jewish state
has judged and condemned one of the cruelest war criminals who
murdered many of our Jewish brethren and relatives,'' Shamir said
in a speech at a Jerusalem hotel.
   The Polish-born Shamir lost relatives in the Holocaust.
   Also today, an official at the prison where Demjanjuk was held
said guards were ordered to watch the former Ohio autoworker to
prevent him from committing suicide. Demjanjuk's son, John Jr. said
the precautions were ``crazy.''
   Demjanjuk, 68, was returned to his solitary confinement cell in
the maximum-security Ayalon Prison near Tel Aviv on Monday after
receiving the death penalty for sending hundreds of thousands of
Jews to their deaths in World War II as a brutal Nazi guard called
``Ivan the Terrible.''
   Since returning to prison, he has been placed ``under 24-hour
guard, and we are asking his guards to be more careful, more
alert,'' said Johnny Tester, spokesman for the Israel Prison
Service. ``We want to be prepared.''
   John Jr. told The Associated Press the prison's precautions had
``no basis in fact. It's crazy. They're going to pop up with that
kind of stupid propaganda to try to make it seem he's showed signs
he's going to kill himself out of remorse or guilt.''
   ``My father would never attempt something like that because he's
innocent and he'll fight this to the last minute. I've visited my
dad and I know what frame of mind he's in,'' John Jr. said.
   The Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk of Cleveland has insisted he is a
victim of mistaken identity and plans to appeal his conviction to
Israel's Supreme Court.
   John Jr., 22, said the defense would not file an appeal for
several weeks, until after the family returns home to map out an
appeal strategy.
   He also said the family would hire a new lawyer to help prepare
the appeal in addition to the current defense team of John Gill of
Cleveland, Paul Chumak of Toronto and Israeli attorney Yoram
Sheftel.
   According to Israeli law, a conviction with a death sentence
must be appealed to the Supreme Court.
   The last person to be executed in Israel was Nazi war criminal
Adolf Eichmann, who was hanged in 1962. Israeli court officials
have said Demjanjuk would likely be hanged if his conviction is
upheld on appeal.
   Tester said there were no gallows in Israel and that ``if the
appeal is denied, we will have to build one.''
   Some Israelis saw the 14-month trial as a crucial opportunity to
educate the younger generation and remind the world of the horrors
of the Holocaust.
   ``The personal fate of John Demjanjuk isn't important or very
interesting,'' Yosef Lapid, an Israeli commentator and Holocaust
survivor, said on Israel radio. ``The importance of the trial ...
was to remind us of the Holocaust. For most of humanity the
Holocaust is cloudy history.''
   But comparing Demjanjuk's trial with proceedings against
Eichmann 26 years ago, Lapid said: ``The Eichmann trial was a
national catharsis for Israelis, the Demjanjuk trial leaves us in
depression.''
   ``The banality (of Demjanjuk) is more frightening than any
evil,'' Lapid said. ``If this guy could be like that, then there
are millions more like him.''

   A woman accused of killing her husband and
another person discussed killing him with drug overdoses months
before he died from cyanide-tainted aspirin, her daughter testified
at the product-tampering trial.
   Cindy Hamilton, 28, told a federal court jury Monday that a
``discontented'' Stella Nickell briefly mentioned divorcing Bruce
Nickell but ``she said she was not going to lose half of everything
she had fought so hard to get.
   ``Based on what my mother had told me prior to my dad's death, I
believed that she did it,'' Ms. Hamilton said in a packed U.S.
District Court courtroom.
   Her testimony was to continue today in the trial, now in its
second week.
   On Monday, Ms. Hamilton said her mother had questioned her about
such drugs as heroin, cocaine and amphetamines; where they could be
obtained and how much would cause an overdose.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Joanne Maida asked Ms. Hamilton whether
her mother ever discussed specific people in the conversations.
   ``My dad, Bruce Nickell,'' she replied, referring to her
stepfather.
   Prosecutors say Mrs. Nickell, the first person in the United
States to be tried on charges of causing death by tampering with
over-the-counter capsules, plotted to kill Nickell to collect
insurance.
   But prosecutors said the plot unraveled when Ms. Hamilton
challenged her mother's attempt to make his June 1986 death and
that of Susan Katherine Snow a few weeks later look like random
murders. Prosecutors have suggested there were no links between the
victims other than the way they died.
   Government investigators also found Mrs. Nickell's fingerprints
in library books about poisons and that at least one insurance
policy had been forged, prosecutors say.
   ``She was very discontent with him,'' Ms. Hamilton said. ``She
was grateful he stopped drinking ... but she was discontent they
never did anything.'' Nickell was a reformed alcoholic, she said.
   Ms. Hamilton spoke softly but occasionally was choked by tears.
She never looked at her mother; Mrs. Nickell rarely took her eyes
from her daughter.
   When Mrs. Nickell told her daughter in June 1986 that Nickell
was dead, ``She looked at me and said, `I know what you are
thinking and the answer's no,''' Ms. Hamilton testified.
   Ms. Hamilton failed to reveal her suspicions to FBI agents in
interviews shortly after the deaths, saying she was ``scared for
her and I guess to protect her.''
   Ms. Hamilton finally went to officials in January 1987.
   Mrs. Nickell is charged in the deaths of Nickell, 52, and of Ms.
Snow, 40, who died after ingesting poisoned capsules of
Extra-Strength Excedrin.
   Mrs. Nickell also faces three counts of tampering with a product
involved in interstate commerce in the tainting of capsules in two
Extra-Strength Excedrin bottles and an Anacin-3 bottle recovered
from stores in two Seattle suburbs.
   The defense earlier challenged Ms. Hamilton's credibility,
saying she had a history of drug abuse and was motivated to contact
the FBI by a $300,000 reward established by a pharmaceutical group.
   A niece, Wilma Stewart, testified earlier Monday that Mrs.
Nickell ``seemed irked at everything'' a month before the cyanide
deaths but never mentioned harming her husband.
   Asked whether Mrs. Nickell had indicated an intent to kill, Ms.
Stewart replied, ``Absolutely not. Not ever.''
   Prosecutors say the Nickells' marriage was unhappy, and that
Mrs. Nickell was determined not to lose her trailer home in a
divorce. Witnesses have testified that the Nickells were several
thousand dollars in debt when Nickell died.

   South Koreans expressed hope that
today's legislative elections would help promote democracy, but
many also said violent protests could result if widespread vote
fraud occurs.
   ``A lot of problems have surfaced but from a long-term point of
view, I think the elections would be a step forward toward
democracy,'' Kim Soon-im, 43, a housewife in Seoul, said.
   Many voters interviewed shared that view but expressed concern
that ``widespread corruption'' would heighten political instability
before the Olympic Games, opening Sept. 17 in Seoul.
   ``I am afraid the elections would cause new problems rather than
solve them,'' Kang Han-ik, 21, a college student, said. Kang and
many others predicted a flood of lawsuits disputing results of this
election, which follows the first direct presidential election in
16 years.
   In the presidential voting in December, Roh Tae-woo of the
governing Democratic Justice Party won with 36 percent of the vote.
But opposition charges of rigging in that election won little
support from the public, irritated by the opposition's inability to
unite.
   Violence, corrupt campaigning and the alleged use of government
influence to help governing party candidates became issues again in
this campaign.
   Since the official 18-day campaign began, no day passed without
reports of scuffles among rival party supporters, firebomb attacks
on candidates or party offices and other violence. Scores were
injured, although exact figures were not available, and 150 people
were reported detained by police.
   Many people interviewed said they were most concerned by reports
of widespread efforts to buy votes with meals, gifts and cash. The
governing Democratic Justice Party announced it was expelling one
candidate after authorities reported finding thousands of
envelopes, each stuffed with the equivalent of $30 in cash, ready
for mailing at a post office.
   ``I did not receive cash but got a case of soap,'' Lee
Chung-kil, 34, a taxidriver said. ``People say that only fools
would not get gifts. In that sense, I am not a fool.''
   A housewife in a relatively wealthy residential area in Seoul
said it was difficult to reject offers of free lunches or dinners,
made through personal friends associated with certain candidates.
   ``I had received at least 10 offers of free sumptuous meals. I
have a guilty feeling for not voting for any of the candidates who
provided the meals,'' she said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

   Contra leaders met secretly with a top Sandinista
official to plan this week's round of peace talks in Nicaragua, but
one rebel threatened to scrap the talks unless U.S. aid is allowed
to reach the guerrillas.
   Contra leader Adolfo Calero said Monday the truce arrangement
reached last month in Sapoa, Nicaragua, would be in danger if the
leftist Sandinista government continued to block food and medical
supplies to rebel troops inside the Central American country.
   The question of humanitarian aid to the troops will have to be a
top issue at high-level talks planned Thursday in Managua, Calero
said.
   ``We must reach an agreement on that,'' he said. ``If that is
not done, the whole Sapoa agreement will collapse.''
   Sandinista Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Tinoco met with a
Contra official to set ``the agenda and arrangments'' for the
talks, Calero confirmed Monday.
   Tinoco previously accused the Contras of engaging in political
maneuvering to avoid a definitive cease-fire while they freely
receive U.S. humanitarian aid.
   The Contras have three private U.S. companies available to rush
the supplies to Nicaragua as soon as the Sandinistas agree, Calero
said. Some of the aid approved by Congress already was on its way
to refugee camps on the Honduran-Nicaraguan border, he added.
   The plight of the troops has been a contributing cause to a
reported rift among the Contra leaders, but Calero minimized the
differences among the five directors of the Nicaraguan Resistance,
insisting they were united.

<TEXT>
   The City Council has eased its
``anti-ugly'' law _ an ordinance aimed at eliminating suburban
eyesores _ and will allow residents to air their dirty laundry in
public, provided it's not in the front yard.
   The council on Monday scrapped some provisions of the new law
and changed others, bowing to citizen complaints about the
ordinance.
   Among other things, it altered the law to make it enforceable
upon citizen complaint and not merely at the whim of someone in
City Hall.
   Laundry still can't be aired in the front yard, but is
permissible in side yards and on porches and balconies.
   The council in this San Francisco Bay area community also
eliminated its ban on garbage cans in side yards.
   The revised law contains most of its original provisions
intended to rid neighborhoods of discarded furniture, automobile
bodies and other unsightly junk. It bans graffiti, dirt piles,
overgrown vegetation or other debris on residential and
non-residential property, if such messes can be seen from the
street.
   Violators face fines up to $500, and those convicted of breaking
the law more than three times within a year could face both a fine
and a jail sentence.

<HEAD>Afghanistan Marks 10th Anniversary Of Socialist Revolution</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Single name for Najib is cq.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today celebrated the
10th anniversary of its socialist revolution with a Soviet-style
parade of workers, soldiers and military hardware.
   President Najib led dozens of Afghan officials and a
little-known Soviet delegation atop a reviewing stand for the
morning procession.
   The parade followed a night of unusually heavy rifle fire and a
rebel rocket blast in the eastern hills.
   On Monday, Najib proposed a withdrawal of government soldiers
from the posts near the Pakistani border to create ``a non-military
line'' between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Najib said Afghan troops
would leave its positions if anti-government guerrillas and
Pakistani troops do the same.
   The proposal appeared to be little more than a face-saving
admission of the difficulties the Afghan army is having against
onslaughts by anti-communist insurgents, based in Pakistan and
supplied with U.S. and Chinese weapons.
   At the parade, Afghan government troops bearing Soviet-supplied
rifles marched past the leadership and about 500 dignitaries under
striped awnings erected to protect them from the strong sun.
   Reflecting the Kremlin's recent attempts to cut a lower profile
in Afghan government affairs, the senior Soviet in attendance was
Vladimir Orlov of the Russian Republic's parliamentary body, and
even Soviet journalists could not identify the two or three other
Kremlin envoys who stood with Najib on the reviewing stand.
   Six bodyguards with Uzi machine guns stood watch around Najib,
Defense Minister Mohammed Rafi, Premier Sultan Ali Keshmandt and
other Afghan officials. No disturbances took place during the
two-hour parade.
   An Afghan official confirmed today that a rocket fired by
insurgents opposed to the Soviet-backed government had landed in
the city but said he did not know details of damage or whether the
blast had caused casualties.
   ``It was especially noisy last night, perhaps because they (the
guerrillas) wanted to say something about the holiday,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The celebration was reminiscent of Moscow's May Day and
Revolution Day parades, in which hundreds of thousands of Soviets
trek past the leadership assembled at Red Square.
   It was in April 1978 that Marxists inspired and armed by Soviet
advisers staged a coup and killed President Mohammed Daoud. The
revolution sparked a widespread insurgency, plunging the nation
into a civil war and driving an estimated 5 million Afghans into
neighboring Pakistan and Iran.
   Soviet troops and tanks moved in to assist the embattled Kabul
leadership in December 1979, replacing one pro-Soviet government
with another.
   Najib became leader in May 1986, succeeding Babrak Karmal, who
is believed to be taking refuge in the Soviet Union now.
   An estimated 115,000 Soviet soldiers remain in Afghanistan but
they will begin leaving May 15 under a U.N.-mediated peace accord
signed in Geneva on April 15 by the United States, the Soviet
Union, Afghanistan and Pakistan.
   The United States, China and several other countries have been
aiding the Afghan guerrillas via Pakistan. The Soviet Union arms
the Afghan military forces. Each superpower has reserved the right
to continue its assistance as long as the other one does.
   The guerrillas, who were not direct party to the Geneva accord,
have vowed to continue fighting until Najib's government is
overthrown.
   In Islamabad on Monday, a nine-man U.N. monitoring team arrived
for preparations to monitor the implementation of the Geneva
agreement.
   Under the pact, a 50-member U.N. observer force will monitor the
agreement with headquarters in the Kabul and Islamabad.

   A spring snowstorm whitened parts of South Dakota, Nebraska and
Minnesota today, as severe thunderstorms swept through sections of
the South, unleashing at least two tornadoes in Georgia.
   The heaviest snowfall was reported in the Black Hills of South
Dakota. As of late Monday, 7-8 inches blanketed Deerfield.
   Early this morning, Rapid City, S.D., was covered by 4 inches of
snow. Brisk northerly winds produced a wind chill of between zero
and 15 degrees above zero in western South Dakota.
   In Wyoming, wind gusted to 60 mph at Cheyenne, and 3-6 inches of
snow fell in the northeast part of the state. Three inches fell on
Valentine, Neb.
   A winter storm watch was in effect for southwest Minnesota
today, where several inches of snow was expected.
   Ahead of the snow, showers and thunderstorms extended from
eastern and central Nebraska to western Kansas early today.
   A severe thunderstorm struck Pleasanton, Neb., late Monday and
produced golfball-size hail.
   Severe thunderstorms also developed over Georgia and Alabama on
Monday evening, producing high winds, twisters and large hail. A
number of downed trees blocked streets in Columbus, Ga.
   The Lowndes County, Ga., communities of Naylor and Bemiss caught
the worst of the winds.
   ``I laid the baby on the floor and got over him and prayed for
God to save him even if he didn't save me,'' said Ilia Morgan, 61.
   She and her husband, Jack, lost their roof, porch, pump house
and garden, but no one was injured.
   The Naylor Volunteer Fire Department was heavily damaged, with
fire trucks holding up what was left of the station. Near Bemiss,
an unoccupied mobile home was blown off its moorings and dropped on
an empty truck 10 yards away, authorities said.
   Clear skies prevailed this morning from the lower Mississippi
Valley across much of Texas to the desert Southwest. It also was
clear from New England to Pennsylvania and over the West Coast.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
southern Virginia across the Carolinas and Georgia to Florida, and
in southeast Iowa, Illinois, Missouri and eastern Kansas; rain or
snow from Wisconsin across Minnesota and northwest Iowa to South
Dakota and Nebraska; and scattered showers over Vermont and
northeastern New York.
   Highs will be in the 40s or 50s over New England and
northeastern New York, and from the upper Great Lakes across the
upper Mississippi Valley, the northern and central Plains and the
northern and central Rockies to eastern Washington; and the 80s and
lower 90s in Florida, the Gulf Coast region, and much of Texas and
the desert Southwest. Elsewhere, highs will be in the 60s or 70s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 3 above
zero at Yellowstone Park, Wyo., to 80 at Key West Naval Air
Station, Fla.

   A university student whose African gray
parrot died after warning him of a kitchen fire will get another
bird, courtesy of a sympathetic couple that breeds parrots as a
hobby.
   ``I feel sorry for the guy,'' said Patti Martinson of Arvada
who, with her husband, Glenn, agreed to replace the parrot. ``I
know how it feels to lose a pet.''
   Chris Barnes' 7-year-old parrot, Coco, died Saturday morning
from fumes from a burning Teflon-coated pot.
   Barnes' roommate had fallen asleep after leaving a pot of
boiling water on the stove. When the water evaporated, the Teflon
coating began to burn.
   Barnes was asleep when Coco called out his name and awakened him.
   Barnes, a student at the University of Colorado, doused the
flame and aired out the room, but Coco died minutes later from
respiratory arrest, a veterinarian said.
   After reading of Barnes' misfortune, the Martinsons offered him
one of their 22 baby African parrots.
   ``That's the best news I've had in a long time,'' Barnes said.
   The parrots live 70 to 80 years, Martinson said.

   The market expected GNP growth of between 2 percent and 2.5
percent, dealers said.
   ``If the figure is around 2.8 or 3 percent, the market is going
to buy at first because one will expect a tightening by the Fed,''
said a dealer at a U.S. Bank in Frankfurt, West Germany, referring
to the U.S. Federal Reserve.
   ``But in the longer term, it would show that the inclination for
imports is still strong,'' which would cloud the prospects of a
rapid reduction in the U.S. trade deficit.
   A trader in Rome said the market was keeping an eye on the
British pound following Chancellor of the Exchequor Nigel Lawson's
remarks Sunday that any further rise in sterling was
``unsustainable.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.43 yen to a closing 124.57. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 124.40 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday:

<HEAD>City Board Rejects Anti-Fonda Resolution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WATERBURY, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city overwhelmingly has rejected a
request by a group of military veterans to deny actress Jane Fonda
an official welcome when she arrives here to film a movie.
   The Board of Aldermen on Monday voted 11-2, with two
abstentions, to defeat the resolution offered by Gaetano Russo, a
retired major general of the Connecticut National Guard.
   Most of the 300 people watching the vote applauded the final
tally. Twenty-three speakers pleaded with the board to reject the
resolution. Only three offered testimony in support of it.
   The proposed resolution, backed by a group of veterans bitter
over the movie star's 1972 trip to Hanoi in which she was
photographed on a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun, stated the
city would not extend Fonda any official welcome, ``symbolic or
otherwise.''
   Edith Reynolds spoke against the resolution, saying residents
appeared to be forgetting ``our basic laws and privileges that goes
with them. We are free to express ourselves without recriminations.
Jane Fonda spoke up. It is silence that is our real enemy.''
   Fonda, an Academy Award-winning actress, plans to film portions
of a movie called ``Union Street'' in Waterbury this spring.
   Fonda spokesman Stephen Rivers said after the vote that ``Guy
Russo doesn't speak for Vietnam veterans, he doesn't speak for
veterans and tonight the Board of Aldermen said he doesn't speak
for Waterbury.''
   Former U.S. Sen. George McGovern, the 1972 Democratic
presidential nominee, and former First Lady Rosalynn Carter, both
wrote to defend Fonda's right to appear in Waterbury.

<HEAD>After Wreath Laying, Soviets Greeted With Music And Cheering</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strains of bluegrass music and
cheerleaders' chants of ``go Soviets, go'' filled the air as a
Soviet delegation and 150 Americans commemorated the linkup of
Soviet and American troops in World War II.
   To greet three retired Soviet military officers, all veterans of
the linkup of the two armies at the Elbe River on April 25, 1945,
junior high school cheerleaders yelled ``Let's go, red and gold, go
Soviets, go Soviets, big and bold!'' Two dozen schoolchildren sang
``Let There Be Peace on Earth.''
   The Soviets exchanged hugs and handshakes during the ceremony
Monday with four American World War II veterans from Lawrence.
   Earlier in the day, the three-member Soviet delegation laid a
wreath at the grave of Dwight D. Eisenhower, in Abilene, Kan., to
honor the leader of Allied forces in Europe during the war.
   Vladimir Orlov, a retired lieutenant general and the head of the
Soviet delegation, said the former president is well remembered in
the Soviet Union.
   The meeting of Soviet and U.S. troops at the Elbe River signaled
an end to the war. Nazi leader Adolf Hitler committed suicide three
days later, and the Germans surrendered on May 7, 1945.
   In Lawrence, Orlov told reporters he was trying to ``consolidate
friendship'' with Americans during his visit, his first to the
United States.
   American veteran E. Jackson Baur, 75, said that although the
ceremonies will not have any great impact on U.S.-Soviet relations,
``It's one small step in the right direction.''
   The four American veterans who greeted the Soviets in Lawrence
were not at the Elbe when the two Allied armies joined up.

<HEAD>Hahn Would Appear on `The PTL Club' to Help Raise Money</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jessica Hahn says she would consider
appearing on the PTL ministry's television show to help raise
money, and says she wants the financially troubled ministry to
survive.
   ``People probably think I'm so anti-PTL. I'm completely
opposite,'' Miss Hahn said Monday. ``I don't want this dream to
die. It's not (PTL founder) Jim Bakker's dream. God gave him the
dream. ... I'd hate to see it die because one man felt he was
bigger than God.
   ``I would encourage people: They better get a grip on what's
really happening before it's too late and it's turned into a
shopping center.''
   Miss Hahn is the former church secretary whose sexual encounter
with Bakker led to his downfall. She said PTL must survive _ even
if it means bringing back Bakker and his wife.
   ``I almost wish Jim and Tammy would go back,'' Miss Hahn told
The Charlotte Observer from the Playboy mansion in Los Angeles,
where she now lives. ``I'd hate to see that place lost. ... I've
always said from day one that God did call this man.
   ``I'm a little nervous saying this: But if Jim came back, I
believe he wouldn't mess up. People would be behind him, watching
him.''
   PTL, which has lost its tax exempt status, sued Miss Hahn last
week for an estimated $160,000 remaining in a trust account that
had been promised her for not disclosing the 1980 tryst with Bakker.
   Told of Miss Hahn's offer to appear on the show, PTL spokesman
David West chose his words carefully.
   ``We would certainly welcome any sincere and genuine effort to
help,'' West said. ``But at the present we think that having
Jessica appear on the program might not be as helpful as she would
want it to be.''
   Bakker has said he'd like to come back to rescue the ministry.
But PTL's new leadership opposes Bakker's return.

<TEXT>
   Soviet forces are beginning to
withdraw from eastern Afghanistan, where anti-communist guerrillas
have taken several posts since the Geneva accord was signed,
Western diplomatic sources said today.
   The sources, speaking in Islamabad on condition of anonymity,
said the Red Army also has begun transporting wrecked vehicles back
to the Soviet Union, apparently to prevent them from being salvaged
by the insurgents.
   Under the Geneva agreement signed April 14, the estimated
115,000 Soviet troops are to start leaving Afghanistan on May 15.
   Diplomats, quoting reports from their Kabul missions, said
evidence of the impending pullout is seen in heavy Soviet air
traffic in and out of Kabul airport and the movement of massive
Soviet convoys near the capital.
   One source quoted an unidentified Soviet diplomat in Kabul as
saying Soviet troops are being ``consolidated'' in Nangarhar,
Paktia and Paktika provinces, all of which border Pakistan.
   Afghanistan's communist president, Najib, also offered on Monday
to withdraw his own troops from posts near the Pakistan border. He
told three small parties loyal to his government that creation of
``a non-military line'' was contingent on agreement with Pakistan
and the guerrillas.
   Pakistan, where the insurgents are based, is a conduit for U.S.
military aid to the guerrillas. It also houses 3 million refugees
of the civil war.
   Soviet troops intervened in Afghanistan in late 1979 when they
replaced one Marxist government with another.
   Diplomatic sources said the Soviets are resupplying the Afghan
army as they prepare to hand the war over to them.
   However, government troops are reported to have fled several
posts in eastern Afghanistan in the past 10 days, including a
strategic garrison at Barikot on the Pakistan border in
northeastern Kunar province.
   The insurgents also reportedly have overrun six Soviet and
Afghan posts in Logar province, just south of Kabul, and Kandahar
in the southeast.
   Western diplomats disagree on the Kabul government's ability to
survive once the Soviets leave.
   Some diplomats say the insurgents recent successes in the east
signalled the beginning of the end of the Kabul government. Others
predict that heavy fortifications in the capital might keep it
secure after the Soviet pullout.

<HEAD>Russian Church To Get Bones Of English King</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A High Court judge ruled that the bones of a 10th
century English king can be transferred to a Russian exiles' church
near London.
   Deputy Judge Robert Wright decided Monday that the fragmented,
1,000-year-old bones of the young Saxon monarch, Edward the Martyr,
can be moved to the Russian Orthodox Church community at Brookwood.
   The bones are now in a box in a bank vault, and the judge said
they can be transferred when the church, converted from an Anglican
cemetery chapel, has been officially approved as a secure place.
   ``It's an answer to prayer,'' said the Very Rev. Archimandrite
Alexis, head of the Orthodox community at Brookwood. The community
has been looking for saintly relics for its church, which it
renamed St. Edward the Martyr.
   Edward, King of Wessex, ruled for three years and was only 16 or
17 when he was stabbed to death in Dorset, southwest England, in
978. Edward was canonized and his bones at Shaftesbury Abbey in
Dorset attracted pilgrims in the Middle Ages.
   The buried bones were found in 1930 but John and Geoffrey
Claridge, two brothers who had inherited the site, couldn't agree
on what to do with them.
   John Claridge kept the bones and eventually presented them to
the Russian community, while his Geoffrey Claridge sought to have
them returned to the abbey site.
   ``I wanted them to be properly enshrined and only the Russian
Orthodox Church was prepared to do that,'' John Claridge said.
   In the decision, Wright awarded unspecified legal costs to John
Claridge and the Brookwood Russian community.
   Alexis, head of St. Edward's Brotherhood of Brookwood, said the
reason for his church's interest in the bones dates to the 1054
split of Christendom into Eastern and Western churches. The Russian
church claims Edward the Martyr as one of its own because the king
died before the split and worshiped according to its original
doctrines.

<HEAD>Arafat Leaves For Libya After Reconciliation Talks With Assad</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat concluded a
three-day reconciliation visit to Syria today and said his talks
with President Hafez Assad to end a five-year feud were
constructive.
   Arafat's 3{-hour meeting with Assad on Monday night was aimed at
reviving a hard-line alliance against Israel and U.S. Middle East
peace efforts, and at ending the rift that has hampered efforts to
forge Arab unity.
   Sources said the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman left
by plane for Libya after meeting for one hour today with Syrian
Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam, one of Assad's closest advisers.
   As he rode in his limousine to the airport, Arafat shouted to
reporters pressing him for comment on the talks with Assad: ``They
were useful and will have positive results on the Palestinian and
Arab levels.''
   Arafat was accompanied on the flight by Salah Khalaf, the No. 2
man in Fatah, the PLO's main guerrilla faction and Arafat's main
power base.
   An aide said Arafat ``will be back within a month.''
   Also today, Egypt welcomed the Arafat-Assad meeting, saying it
supports Palestinian-Syrian coordination to advance the rights of
the Palestinian people. The announcement was in a statement to
reporters read by Taha Farnawany, head of the Egyptian Foreign
Ministry's Palestine department.
   All Arab countries except Syria, Libya, Algeria and Lebanon
resumed relations with Cairo last year after breaking diplomatic
ties following Egypt's 1979 peace treaty with Israel.
   Six top Arafat aides remained in Syria. Among them was Farouk
Kaddoumi, head of the PLO's political department, as well as other
advisers and members of Fatah's 10-man governing central committee.
   Syrian security men and Arafat's bodyguards prevented reporters
from talking further to Arafat. Palestinian sources, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said Arafat was flying to Tripoli.
   There were no details about the meeting with Khaddam, which also
was attended by Khalaf, Kaddoumi and five other senior aides, all
members of Fatah's central committee.
   One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the fact
that Arafat's top aides stayed behind indicated the PLO-Syrian
reconciliation process was continuing. Lt. Col. Mustafa Kharroubi,
a senior aide to Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi, also stayed in
Damascus.
   Kharroubi had accompanied Arafat to Damascus on Sunday,
culminating a weeklong mediation effort by Gadhafi and Algerian
President Chadli Benjedid.
   It was Arafat's first visit to the Syrian capital since Assad
expelled him on June 24, 1983, at the height of the feud touched
off by a Syrian-backed mutiny in the PLO against Arafat's
leadership.
   Presidential spokesman Jibrane Kourieh said the Arafat-Assad
talks centered on the 5-month-old Palestinian uprising in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and ``the Arab and
Palestinian situations.''
   Other PLO sources said the United States' latest Middle East
peace proposals and a common strategy against Israel also were on
the agenda.

<TEXT>
   For two rubles, Soviet personal computer users
soon will be able to access information probably beyond the
capabilities of their present systems.
   In the first joint publishing venture between the United States
and Soviet Union, officials signed an agreement Monday to publish a
Russian-language edition of a major personal computing magazine.
   ``No magazines of any kind in the USSR are based on the concept
of a joint venture with another firm, for personal computers or
anything else,'' Eugene N. Salnicov, director of Radio i Sviaz
Publishers, said of the business agreement with International Data
Group Communications Inc.
   About 50,000 copies of PC World USSR will hit Soviet bookstores
and newsstands in late June priced at two rubles, or $3.20 at the
official exchange rate, said IDG president Alex Leblois. The
magazine will contain about one-third original copy written by a
staff of seven Soviet editors and writers.
   Personal computing is in its infancy in the Soviet Union, which
officials said has had trouble manufacturing computers. There are
fewer than 100,000 personal computers in the country, but Soviet
and American officials tout a potential market of 30 million.
   The liberalization of foreign investment laws, Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost and the recent easing of
Western technology export laws are critical to the publication of
the new magazine.
   Leblois said that U.S. high-tech export regulations were eased
in January to allow 16-bit personal computers to be sold to the
Soviet Union. He predicted that American, Western European and
Japanese computer makers will rush to secure joint production
agreements.
   In keeping with Soviet guidelines on joint ventures adopted in
January 1987, the Soviet partner will own 51 percent of the project
to IDG's 49 percent.
   Salnicov and Michael Volodarsky, chief advisor to the chairman
of Goskomizdat, the Soviet state committee on publishing, printing
and book trade, signed the agreement at IDG headquarters in
Framingham, Mass.
   Leblois said IDG has invested $250,000 in the project but
expects to recoup that almost immediately through advertising from
Western computer makers seeking a foothold in the Soviet Union.
   Marshall Goldman, associate director of the Russian Research
Center at Harvard University, said the principle problem with about
30 joint ventures between the Soviets and foreign companies to date
has been the repatriation of hard currency.
   But IDG said PC World USSR's sales will cover all production
costs and that its revenues will come from advertising paid for in
Western currencies. Foreign firms typically have had problems
getting ruble earnings out of the Soviet Union.
   Salnicov said some foreign language computer journals are
available in Moscow libraries but that Soviet PC users have no
information about developments within the country.
   IDG publishes PC World, the second largest U.S. publication on
personal computers with a monthly circulation of about 475,000.

   Laos in June will hold its first
national elections since the communist takeover in December 1975, a
spokesman of the Laotian Embassy in Bangkok said today.
   The official Laotian news agency KPL said district
representatives would be elected in the June 26 elections. Dates
for elections at the central, provincial and prefectural levels
will be determined later, said the report, dated Monday.
   The report quoted an April 21 decree signed by Prime Minister
Kaysone Phomvihane.
   No details were made public on whether there would be more than
one candidate for each post.
   The decree said the election was aimed at ``enabling all
citizens to widely participate in the election of their
representatives to the supreme power institutions at all levels.''
   Ly Bounkham, spokesman for the Laotian Embassy in Bangkok, said
the election would be the first nationwide balloting since the
Pathet Lao seized power 13 years ago.
   ``Stable circumstances prevailing in Laos have suggested that
this would be a right time to have the elections,'' Ly said. ``Laos
has progressed over these years and the country, to a degree, must
adapt to many changes.''
   Laos, a largely isolated nation that is also one of the world's
poorest countries, has been following ``democratization'' reforms
undertaken by its closest allies, Vietnam and the Soviet Union.

<TEXT>
   Panama's embattled ambassador to Israel
blames his troubles with his own government on an Israeli adviser
to Panamanian military strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Ambassador Eduardo Herrera told a news conference Monday his
dismissal from Panama's army after 22 years service followed an
argument with the Israeli, Mike Harare, a security adviser to
Noriega.
   Herrera, who denied reports he also had been dismissed as
ambassador, said his disagreements with Harare arose after he
accused the Israeli of using his position to charge large
commissions to Israelis trying to do business in Panama.
   ``He blocked commercial ties and potential investments,''
Herrera told reporters at his home outside Tel Aviv. ``He demanded
commissions before anyone could even set foot in Panama.''
   Harare is reportedly in Israel, but efforts to locate him for
comment were unsuccessful.
   A three-page, unsigned flyer issued in Panama last year accused
Harare of making huge profits from business deals, including arms
sales, Morton Rosenthal of the B'nai B'rith Anti-Defamation League
in New York said in a telephone interview.
   The league issued a report linking anti-Semitic threats in
Panama to the allegations against Harare, Rosenthal said.
   Herrera said that in January he ``went to Panama and told the
government everything I knew about Harare. I tore the mask off his
face.''
   He said the two quarreled in April after the ambassador sold an
embassy car driven by Harare. The ambassador said he sold the car
to save money.
   Harare sent the ambassador a threatening letter warning him not
to sell the car. Herrera wrote back saying he was not afraid.
   ``The letter arrived on April 18. That evening, the (Panamanian)
radio reported that I was dismissed from the army,'' Herrera said.
   No reason was given for Herrera's dismissal in reports from
Panama, but sources told reporters there that Herrera had twice
refused instructions to return home.
   Herrara said Monday an order for him to return home had been
rescinded. He also denied reports from Panama that he was fired as
ambassador.
   An Israeli Foreign Ministry official in Jerusalem said the
Israeli government has not received any notification from Panama
that Herrera has been dismissed.
   Noriega is the head of Panama's Defense Force and holds the
power in Panama. Opposition groups in Panama want him to step down.
The United States is supporting the opposition campaign and has
imposed economic sanctions on Panama in an attempt to force Noriega
to leave his post.

<TEXT>
   Eighteen people have been arrested for stealing
and marketing long distance access codes that rang up an estimated
$4.5 million in fraudulent telephone calls, officials said.
   The arrests came after a federal grand jury in Honolulu returned
indictments alleging theft of telephone access codes that may have
been obtained through sophisticated computer technology, federal
officials said.
   U.S. Attorney Gene Anderson and Skip Jones, head of the Secret
Service office here, said in a news release Monday the 18 people
were charged with conspiracy to steal and market long distance
codes in a nationwide network.
   The indictments said the defendants acquired long distance
telephone credit card numbers and access codes and then marketed
those codes to defraud long distance telephone companies, the
officials said.
   Anderson and Jones said they said they seized numerous
unauthorized access codes and a variety of computer and
telecommunications equipment used in the conspiracy. Access codes
are numbers dialed before a telephone number that allow a caller to
use a particular company's long-distance network.
   Anderson and Jones said the indictments and arrests culminated
an eight-month undercover operation by the U.S. Secret Service
office in Honolulu into the wholesale marketing of unauthorized
access codes.
   Agents made more than 600 undercover telephone contacts with
people involved in marketing the codes, officials said. The
undercover agents received more than 600 unauthorized telephone
access codes from the individuals charged.
   Anderson and Jones said the industry has indicated that more
than $4.5 million in fraudulent calls can be attributed to those
600 codes.
   According to industry estimates, several of those indicted are
principal operators of marketing networks responsible for $125
million in telephone access fraud over the past year, they said.
This represents half of the estimated loss of this type from such
marketing schemes throughout the nation, they said.
   The government said the Communications Fraud Control
Association, a long distance telephone clearinghouse, estimates
losses from all types of access device fraud at about $500 million
annually for the $40 billion per year long distance telephone
industry.

<HEAD>Family To Continue Fight To Clear Demjanjuk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Demjanjuk's family intends to continue its
fight to vindicate the retired Cleveland autoworker who was
sentenced to hang after an Israeli court determined he was the Nazi
death-camp guard ``Ivan the Terrible.''
   An Israeli panel of judges Monday sentenced Demjanjuk, 68, to
death. The three judges ruled a week ago that the former Ohio
autoworker was responsible for the deaths of thousands of Jews at
the Treblinka concentration camp in Poland during World War II.
   Ed Nishnic, Demjanjuk's son-in-law, said Demjanjuk ``has been
railroaded through the Israeli court system.''
   Nishnic said the family still believes that Demjanjuk is
innocent and would ``fight all the way to the end.''
   ``I spoke to Mr. Demjanjuk yesterday. He believes half the world
already knows he is not `Ivan the Terrible' and the rest of the
world will learn it soon,'' Nishnic said.
   Demjanjuk claimed a case of mistaken identity, but some
concentration camp survivors identified Demjanjuk as the prison
guard who would beat Jews on the way to the gas chamber. The judges
ruled that his alibi, that he was a prisoner of war who never was
in Treblinka, did not stand up to scrutiny.
   In Cleveland, lawyer John J. Horrigan, who as an assistant U.S.
attorney represented the government in Demjanjuk's 1981
denaturalization trial, said the death sentence came as no surprise.
   ``In the end, they, like every other court or tribunal who
looked at the case, were left with little alternative but to find
him guilty and impose the only sentence consistent with that
finding,'' Horrigan said. ``His alibi was a joke.''
   But members of Cleveland's Ukrainian community still believed
Demjanjuk.
   ``It has been the unanimous opinion of this parish that
Demjanjuk is innocent. That has been the opinion since the
beginning,'' said the Rev. John Nakonachny, a priest at St.
Vladimir's Ukrainian Orthodox Church, the Demjanjuk family's parish.
   After the verdict, vandals painted purple circles on St.
Vladimir's, and Jewish organizations in Akron, about 40 miles south
of Cleveland, asked for additional police protection because
callers were threatening local Jews.
   Police said a priest at St. Vladimir's told them the purple
paint might signify blood on the church.
   In Buffalo, N.Y., Demjanjuk's former attorney said he does not
think Demjanjuk will be executed.
   ``The Israeli people are the real jury,'' said Mark O'Connor,
who represented Demjanjuk for five years during deportation
proceedings and during the beginning of trial. ``While they have
doubts I don't see how the court can go through with it.''
   O'Connor said he was fired last year because Demjanjuk's family
thought he was being ``pro-Jewish'' by refraining from attacking
witnesses and using the Talmud to make his points.
   Martin Plax, Cleveland-area director for the American Jewish
Committee, said the sentencing represented ``a sense of relief and
closure that the sort of behavior exhibited by `Ivan the Terrible'
has been adjudicated.''
   Mary Dackiewicz, operating the John Demjanjuk Defense Fund, said
donations to the fund had slackened recently, but calls picked up
again Monday.
   ``The phone calls are from people who have been totally outraged
at what happened over there,'' she said. ``They're people from all
different backgrounds wanting to donate money and asking what they
can do to help.''

   A fire at a NATO storage depot gave
off a huge cloud of smoke that dusted nearby communities with
dangerous asbestos, authorities said.
   Officials used bullhorns to warn people living just west of
Monday's fire to stay inside and avoid stirring up the asbestos
powder.
   The asbestos came from the roof of the burning 10-acre warehouse
at the depot in Donnington in western England.
   A team of 120 local workers put on masks and protective clothing
to clean up the worst contaminated areas.
   Asbestos is a fibrous material used to fireproof and insulate.
It has been linked to lung cancer and other diseases, and other
building materials have increasingly replaced it.
   In dust form, asbestos can cause an often fatal lung disease
called pneumoconiosis.
   The warehouse that caught fire is part of a North Atlantic
Treaty Organization depot employing several thousand people. It is
one of the Western defense alliance's biggest storage areas for
technical equipment and spare parts for military vehicles.
   The army said the warehouse contained no ammunition. No cause of
the fire was given.
   The 190 civilian and British army personnel working in the
warehouse were evacuated, and there were no reports of injury.
   The Army said damage was expected to run into millions of
dollars.

   Following an anonymous tip and
distribution of a suspect's photograph, sheriff's deputies arrested
an ex-convict in the shooting death of a pregnant woman who gave
birth minutes before she died.
   Kenneth Charles Hodges, 44, was arrested without incident Monday
night at a Salt Lake County apartment and was being booked for
investigation of first-degree murder in the death Friday night of
Anna Holmes, 31, Sheriff Pete Hayward said.
   The woman was shot in the head during a robbery at a video store
in Kearns, just west of Salt Lake City, and died minutes after
giving birth by Caesarean section to a fourth daughter.
   Authorities received a tip Sunday from an anonymous woman who
said a man matching the description of the gunman was in a Salt
Lake City park and should be investigated, Hayward said.
   City police questioned the man, who told them he was a transient
who had been sleeping on the streets. He had no identification, the
officers said.
   The officers did not have probable cause to arrest the man, but
they had a crime lab technician photograph him.
   Two witnesses to the slaying identified the man in the photo as
the gunman, and by Monday afternoon, more than 150 copies of the
photo had been distributed to law enforcement officers searching
for the suspect.
   Hayward said Hodges is wanted in Eureka, Calif., for burglary
and has a long list of arrests. He said the man served time in the
Utah State Prison but was not on probation or parole.

   Rock star Madonna's 18-year-old brother
has pleaded innocent to charges that he injured a police officer
checking out loud noises at a downtown home.
   Mario Ciccone allegedly ``shoved, or slammed, or shut, or kicked
without warning the door in the officer's face, knocking him down,
breaking his glasses and cutting his forehead,'' Police Chief
Theodore Glynn said.
   Ciccone, youngest of Madonna's seven brothers and sisters and
listed in court documents as living with his parents in the
northern Detroit suburb of Rochester Hills, pleaded innocent Monday
to a charge of resisting and obstructing a police officer.
   District Court Judge Robert Shipper released him on personal
bond pending a preliminary examination May 5. The misdemeanor
charge carries a maximum penalty of two years in prison.
   Police officer Michael Weidner, 31, and another police officer
went to the house April 16 when they heard what sounded like shots
or firecrackers, according to Glynn and police reports.
   They found a loud party in progress and were asking questions at
the door when ``Mr. Ciccone kicked it from the other side into
Weidner's face,'' the police report said.
   Weidner sustainted a cut that required more than 30 stitches and
has not returned to full duty, officials said.

   Two Israeli soldiers and three Arab
guerrillas died today in a predawn clash near the border with
Israel, police reported.
   A police spokesman said the clash began at 3:30 a.m. near the
southern village of Kfar Shouba when Israeli troops opened fire on
a seven-man guerrilla group. The spokesman said the guerrillas were
made up of two pro-Soviet groups _ the Lebanese Communist Party and
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine of George Habash.
   A ``fierce clash'' raged for about three hours, said the police
spokesman, who cannot be named in line with standing regulations.
   The Israelis ``fired flares at the rate of 20 every five minutes
as their helicopter gunships chased the guerrillas in the region,''
he said.
   The police spokesman said the guerrillas ``apparently (were)
ambushed before launching a cross-border raid into northern
Israel.''
   Kfar Chuba is a small village about one mile from the Israeli
border on the slopes of biblical Mt. Hermon that towers over the
region where the borders of Lebanon, Israel and Syria converge.
   The village is inside Israel's self-designated ``security zone''
that was established when Israel withdrew the bulk of its troops
from Lebanon in 1985.

<HEAD>Former President Says Party Ticket With Jackson `Amazingly
Attractive'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Jimmy Carter said today that
a Democratic presidential ticket with Jesse Jackson would be
``amazingly attractive'' and enable the party to carry the South.
   ``Six months ago, to be blunt about it, I would have said
`no','' Carter said on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.'' ``But
Jackson has fooled everyone.''
   The former president said Jackson's ``attractiveness and the
quality of his campaign has been amazing'' and ``it's much easier
to say very honestly that Jackson would be amazingly attractive on
the ticket compared to what everybody thought he would do before
this campaign started.''
   Carter said he thought a ticket with Jackson on it would win in
the South and carry his home state of Georgia.
   ``As you know, Jackson came in first in Georgia as it was,'' he
said.
   Carter did not specify whether he envisioned Jackson in the
presidential or vice presidential slot.
   Carter, who will attend the Democratic National Convention as a
``super delegate,'' has refused to endorse any of the party's
candidates, but said if someone ``had to bet one way or another,''
Michael Dukakis would be the most likely nominee.
   Asked if Jackson should be the party's vice presidential choice,
Carter said it would be improper for him to presume that Dukakis _
not Jackson _ would win the nomination.
   He added that if Dukakis wins the nomination, ``Jackson has
exhibited in the last year or so a remarkable element of
substantiality and common sense and loyalty to the party and
attractiveness to a wide range of people and I guess then, in the
convention, that whatever happens, Jackson's support will be
constructive whether he's on the ticket or not.''

   An anti-nuclear group's choices for the
nation's worst nuclear power plants are largely identical to a list
compiled by government regulators in 1986.
   The group, Public Citizen, on Monday named 16 plants as the
nation's worst. Thirteen of those plants were also on the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission's list.
   Of the 16, Public Citizen named two as worst than the rest.
   Those plants were Pilgrim, near Plymouth, Mass., operated by
Boston Edison Co., and Rancho Seco at Sacramento, Calif., operated
by the Sacramento Municipal Utility District.
   Both were closed throughout 1987 at the insistence of the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission to correct operational and management
problems. Local authorities are discussing the sale of Rancho Seco,
now operating at 30 percent of full power under recent restart
approval granted by the commission, and Sacramento voters will
decide next month whether to keep it open.
   ``The similarity between Public Citizen's list and the NRC's
list strongly suggests that these plants are indeed the worst in
the United States,'' Public Citizen's ``Critical Mass'' project
said in its Monday report entitled ``Nuclear Lemons.''
   Public Citizen is an advocacy organization founded by consumer
activist Ralph Nader.
   Responding, the Committee for Energy Awareness, a pro-nuclear
trade group, said industry performance is improving, as shown by
reductions in unplanned automatic shutdowns of reactors, radiation
exposure and lost-time accidents.
   Spokesman Don Winston said the committee had not had a chance to
study the Pulic Citizen report in detail.
   Public Citizen ranked the nation's 105 operating civilian
nuclear power reactors according to 10 criteria such as downtime,
operation and maintenance expense and exposure of the workforce to
radiation.
   A reactor was awarded 15 points if it was the worst in a
category, 14 if the second worst and so forth. Rankings were made
by the number of ``15 worst'' lists the reactor appeared on, with
points used as a tiebreaker.
   The 16 plants named by Public Citizen are:
   Rancho Seco, Sacramento, Calif.; Pilgrim, Plymouth, Mass.; Peach
Bottom No. 3, Delta, Pa.; Peach Bottom No. 2, Delta, Pa.; Fermi No.
2, Monroe, Mich.; Oyster Creek, Forked River, N.J.; Sequoyah No. 1,
Chattanooga, Tenn.; Browns Ferry No. 2, Decatur, Ala.; Browns Ferry
No. 3, Decatur, Ala.; Browns Ferry No. 1, Decatur, Ala.;
Davis-Besse, Toledo; Dresden No. 2, Morris, Ill.; LaSalle No. 1,
Seneca, Ill.; Fort St. Vrain, Denver; Sequoyah No. 2, Chattanooga,
Tenn., and Byron No. 1, Rockford, Ill.
   The Ranch Seco, Pilgrim, Sequoyah and Browns Ferry plants were
all closed throughout 1987.
   A similar list compiled by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in
1986 originally included Oyster Creek and the two Cook plant
reactors at Benton Harbor, Mich. These three were deleted and
replaced by the two Peach Bottom reactors. The commission also
included the LaSalle No. 2 plant and the Turkey Point No. 3 and No.
4 plants near Miami, and did not include the Dresden No. 2 and
Byron No. 1 plants that appeared on Public Citizen's list.

   Riot police today fired tear gas to
break up demonstrations against alleged vote fraud as South Koreans
cast ballots for a new parliament in an election the governing
party was expected to win.
   The opposition, which failed to unify before the election,
charged the government was manipulating vote-counting computers
after a state-run television station reported Monday that a
governing party candidate had won with 39 percent of the vote.
   The MBC network said a local affiliate on Cheju Island
accidentally broadcast an election rehearsal. The network said it
fired the station manager and four other officials.
   Seoul prosecutors today said their counterparts on Cheju Island
were investigating whether election laws were violated by the
broadcast.
   The state-controlled KBS television network, meanwhile, reported
after the polls closed that five governing party members and three
opposition candidates were leading their races.
   In Seoul, police fired tear gas to disperse 300 Yonsei
University students who threw rocks and firebombs to protest
alleged election manipulation in favor of the governing Democratic
Justice Party of President Roh Tae-woo.
   Earlier, police broke up a similar protest by 50 Yonsei
students. No injuries were reported in either demonstration.
   In the afternoon, hundreds of students dashed through alleys and
sidestreets in Seoul's downtown Myongdong shopping area, shouting
slogans against ``election rigging'' and chanting ``Down with
dictatorship.''
   Police pursued them, sometimes hurling tear gas grenades. At one
point, citizens rescued a student being dragged away by riot police.
   Yonhap, the Korean news agency, said police arrested more 120
students in Kwangju and nearby areas in southwestern South Korea.
   In the southern city of Chonju, about 500 dissidents and
opposition supporters battled riot police in the streets for nearly
two hours.
   Voting began at 7 a.m. at 13,812 pollings stations nationwide to
choose a 299-member National Assembly.
   The polls closed at 6 p.m. (5 a.m. EDT). Most returns were
expected by early Wednesday.
   Officials estimated 72.6 percent of the 26.2 million registered
voters turned out, down from 84.6 percent in the 1985 legislative
elections and 89.2 percent in the December presidential election.
   Opposition leader Kim Young-sam of the Reunification Democratic
Party, who ran for an assembly seat in the southern city of Pusan,
accused the government of staging ``unfair, unjust elections
unprecedented in our history.''
   On Monday, the governing party expelled one candidate after
4,296 envelopes, each containing the equivalent of about $30 and
campaign leaflets for Democratic Justice candidate Kwon Joong-dong,
were intercepted by opposition members at a post office in Andong,
south of Seoul. Police reported 90 cases of election-related
violence nationwide in the campaign, with more than 150 people
detained and 77 of them formally charged.
   A 90-second broadcast on Monday on southern Cheju Island by an
affiliate of the state-controlled MBC national television network
said a governing party candidate had won in a local district and it
gave vote totals.
   The network later apologized for what it called a technical
error by engineers during a rehearsal for scheduled live broadcast
of the ballot count.
   But protesters said the use of definite numbers in the broadcast
was proof the government planned to manipulate the computer vote
count.
   About 400 students in Cheju marched in the streets early today,
protesting ``an unforgivable government attempt at computer
manipulation.''
   Students in Kwangju, Chonju, Pusan and Cheju also held rallies
to denounce the broadcast and vowed to launch more anti-government
protests.
   Later, however, an official at the Central Election Management
Committee said: ``The voting is proceeding relatively smoothly.''
   Roh's rising popularity and a split within the opposition were
expected to help the Democratic Justice Party win a majority in the
National Assembly.
   Public support for the opposition eroded after its leaders, Kim
Dae-jung of the Party for Peace and Democracy and Kim Young-sam,
both insisted on running in the December presidential election,
splitting the opposition vote. Roh won the first direct
presidential election in 16 years with 36 percent of the vote.
   The opposition gained momentum in widespread anti-government
protests last June. Roh, then chairman of the Democratic Justice
Party, agreed to many of the democratic reforms demanded by the
opposition and the political climate has become freer.
   The governing party, campaigning on pledges of stability for
economic and democratic progress, hoped to win about 125 of the 224
seats being decided in single-member districts, along with 38 of
the 75 seats to be decided by the parties' nationwide vote
proportions.
   A new constitution that took effect in February gives the
National Assembly greater power in such matters as inspecting state
affairs, and the president no longer can dissolve it.

   U.S. and Vietnamese officials began
talks today on ways to speed up America's resettlement of
Vietnamese, including children fathered by American servicemen
during the Vietnam War.
   Ross Petzing, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, said
the American team at the talks was headed by Bruce Beardsley,
director of the embassy's Refugee and Migration Affairs unit.
   The Vietnamese delegation is headed by Hoang Quoc Tin, deputy
director of the Foreign Ministry's consular department, said a
Vietnamese embassy official.
   The talks, the latest of the regularly scheduled sessions on
technical issues, are scheduled to last two days.
   U.S. military experts, meanwhile, are completing a survey of a
warplane crash site in southern Laos and will soon excavate it to
search for remains of missing Americans, a U.S. official said today.
   The excavation in Savannakhet province will be the third such
U.S.-Laotian effort to account for Americans listed as missing in
action in Laos during the Vietnam War. Savannakhet is in the
southern panhandle area between Thailand and Vietnam.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
American team was being led by Lt. Col. Joe Harvey, commander of
the U.S. Joint Casualty Resolution Center headquartered in Honolulu.
   More than 500 Americans still are listed as missing in Laos from
the war in Indochina.
   In the negotiations with Vietnam, the two sides are to discuss
the processing of Vietnamese under the Orderly Departure Program.
   More than 64,000 Vietnamese have been resettled in America under
the program, established in 1980 as an alternative to the tragic
boat exodus.
   U.S. officials will also discuss America's proposal to resettle
within two years up to 12,000 Amerasians, or half-American
children, and their immediate families.
   The United States thus far has resettled more than 4,000
Amerasians.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With a bid of $4.94 million, Warner Books has
won the right to publish the much-ballyhooed sequel to Margaret
Mitchell's civil war novel ``Gone With the Wind.''
   ``We wanted to be the first to know what happened to Rhett and
Scarlett,'' said Laurence J. Kirshbaum, president of Warner Books,
after his company won the Monday night auction.
   Warner Books now has the right to publish the sequel in the
United States and Canada. The manuscript, to be written by novelist
Alexandra Ripley, is expected to be finished late next year and
published in 1990.
   At least six publishers took part in the auction, organized by
the William Morris Agency as agents for Miss Mitchell's estate.
Warner Books' bid topped Dell Publishing Co., which offered $4.8
million.
   According to publishing company executives quoted by The New
York Times, Warner must sell about 250,000 hardback copies at $25
each and 33 million paperbacks to make money on the book.
   But Kirshbaum would not confirm those figures: ``I'm going to
think about it tomorrow,'' he said, lifting a line from Scarlett
O'Hara.
   The original novel has sold 25 million copies since it was first
published in 1936.

Franklin, 43-year-old sister of singer Aretha Franklin, has died of
cancer at her sister's home.
   Among Miss Franklin's compositions were ``Gotta Find Me An
Angel'' and ``Ain't No Way,'' both made into million-sellers by
Aretha Franklin.
   She also arranged ``Take Another Little Piece of My Heart'' by
Erma Franklin, another sister and singer, a song later made popular

   Carolyn Franklin was born in Memphis and moved with her family
to Buffalo, N.Y., and then to Detroit in 1946. As a child, she
formed a singing group with members of the young people's choir at
New Bethel Baptist Church, where her father was pastor.
   She, Erma and their cousin, Brenda Bryant, sang background on
Aretha Franklin's early records.
   Besides her sisters, survivors include her grandmother and two
brothers.
   Funeral arrangements were pending for Miss Franklin, who died
Monday.

   A city worker has been accused of
setting a series of fires to punish narcotics-dealing transvestites
who had robbed him of $50, officials said.
   Robert Bergeron, 31, of Baker, is charged with setting fire to
16 vacant houses in the last four days because they were a haven
for the transvestites, according to police.
   Bergeron, an employee in the Department of Public Works, was
still being held today after being booked early Monday on 16 counts
of simple arson. He is being held on $10,000 bond.
   Police reports quoted Bergeron as saying he was robbed of $50 by
transvestites and felt the only way he could get even was to ``burn
their houses.''
   Two firefighters were injured in the fires, which caused up to a
half-million dollars in damage.

   A small bomb exploded today near a fruit
juice shop in Moslem west Beirut, and police said three people were
injured.
   A police spokesman said the bomb, planted in a garbage bin, went
off at 2:30 p.m. near the juice shop in the crowded Barbir Street.
   ``The explosion shattered the shop's glass front and three
pedestrians were slightly injured by glass shards,'' said the
spokesman, who cannot be named because of regulations.
   The explosion also damaged two parked cars, the police spokesman
added.
   On Saturday, a pickup truck loaded with explosives went off in
the northern city of Tripoli, killing 70 people and wounding 110 in
the deadliest car bombing in Lebanon in three years.

   Deserters from an elite military
unit battled government soldiers today, and at least seven people
were killed, the military said.
   Four government troops and three deserters from the military's
elite Scout Rangers were killed during the predawn clash near here
on the small island of Mactan, where Cebu's international airport
is located.
   Local radio stations said one civilian also died.
   The deserters, who took refuge on the island in 1986 and formed
a religious cult, attacked a military checkpoint set up to prevent
them from leaving their hideout, military officials said.
   Maxim Patalinhug, mayor of nearby Lapu-Lapu City, met with the
leader of the renegades to try to convince him to give up. He told
reporters Sgt. Jose Sabandeja promised to ask his men to surrender,
but the renegade leader said he needed time to do so.
   Patalinhug said about 600 civilians were holed up with the
deserters and that they maintained they were willing to die with
the rangers.
   Brig. Gen. Jesus Hermosa, regional military commander, said in a
statement that he called off a planned attack on the deserters
today to allow officials time to negotiate.
   ``The outlaws have many conditions which are not acceptable,''
Hermosa said. ``Their surrender would be unconditional. They should
face the consequences. We have to hold operations due to nightfall
and we don't want to hurt civilians. Operations will continue
tomorrow by daybreak.''
   Hermosa has vowed to capture the 30 to 50 renegades, who moved
to Mactan after deserting their unit on Mindanao island.
   The military claims the renegades have been involved in
smuggling operations.

   A federal appeals court has decided that
attorneys for indicted Teamsters union President Jackie Presser
don't have a right to secret documents the federal government is
protecting.
   A three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled unanimously Monday that a lower court was incorrect in
ordering government prosecutors to share the documents.
   Federal prosecutors want to keep the documents confidential
until the July 12 trial of Presser and co-defendants Harold
Friedman and Anthony Hughes, fellow officers of Cleveland's
Teamsters Local 507.
   The appeals court reversed U.S. District Judge George White in
Cleveland, who had ruled in favor of defense attorneys.
   ``In essence, the district court concluded ... that the defense
has a constitutional right to know the tactical strengths and
weaknesses of the government's case against it. The Supreme Court
has never held that the Constitution creates such a right and we do
not believe that it exists,'' Judge Danny Boggs wrote in the 6th
Circuit's decision.
   Defense attorney John Climaco said Monday he was unaware of the
appellate ruling. He declined to comment until he had a chance to
see the opinion.
   White is scheduled to preside over the July 12 trial. The three
defendants are charged in a May 1986 federal indictment with having
perpetrated a $700,000 payroll-padding scheme in which ``ghost
employees'' were put on the union payroll of Local 507.
   Presser, 60, is secretary-treasurer of Local 507, as well as
president of the 1.6 million-member Teamsters union.
   The defense argued that Presser and the other defendants were
serving as government informants at the time and that the FBI had
authorized them to go ahead with the payroll-padding scheme.

   An evacuation rehearsal of the town
surrounding the nation's only methyl isocyanate plant was not
realistic because it was too well planned, critics claim.
   Sirens sounded twice about seven minutes apart at Institute to
signal the evacuation, the first coming at 9:19 a.m., 19 minutes
late. One hour later, only about 30 people had arrived at an
emergency shelter in nearby South Charleston.
   ``The participation of citizens is not all that important,''
said Kanawha County Commission President Doug Stump, who called
Monday's exercise successful.
   Most residents and workers at businesses and West Virginia State
College either skipped work or ignored the drill. Construction
workers at the college's new science building across the street
from one siren continued working.
   The town is the site of a Rhone-Poulenc chemical plant that
formerly was owned by Union Carbide Corp. The plant produces methyl
isocyanate, the chemical that leaked from a Union Carbide plant in
Bhopal, India, in 1984, killing more than 2,000 people.
   Less than a year after the Bhopal disaster, the leak of another
chemical at the Institute plant injured at least 135 people,
prompting the call by some community leaders for an organized
evacuation plan for the town of 1,500.
   Local officials built a one-lane emergency road to help
residents flee, but the gate to that road is kept locked except
when needed. Monday was the first time it was used.
   Stump said the drill was designed primarily as a training
exercise for police, firefighters and other emergency workers.
``It's like basic training in the Army; you know the procedures but
every real incident will be different,'' he said.
   Monday's evacuation was conducted under special circumstances.
West Virginia State College, next door to the plant, called off
classes in the morning, so there were few students to evacuate. The
town also was evacuated in stages so the roads leading out of town
wouldn't be too crowded.
   ``When this was prepared, people didn't take it seriously,''
said Lois Thurston, a custodian at West Virginia State. ``I'm sure
if the students were here, they wouldn't know what was going on.''
   ``I can envision cars all over the track. It's just a little
trail. It would be mayhem,'' said Barbara Clark, a health and
physical education instructor at West Virginia State. ``It will be
a mess.''
   Carla Tyree, a Rhone-Poulenc employee and Institute resident,
was among dozens of volunteers who manned the streets to direct
traffic, carried out emergency procedures or took notes on Monday's
drill.
   ``All in all I think the community's glad this kind of response
is going on,'' said Tyree. ``I'm sure a lot of persons have learned
what to do in an emergency as far as coordinating ... learning who
does what.''
   Rosie McKnight, who lives about a mile from the plant, said she
didn't hear the siren and didn't realize the drill was under way
until her husband came by their house.
   ``I wanted to participate so they can get an accurate play out
on what would happen,'' McKnight said. ``If they're going to spend
all that money trying to get this operation, the least we can do is
participate.''

<HEAD>AMA Files to have FDA Regulate `Smokeless' Cigarettes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BERNARD SCHOENBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Medical Association's move to seek
federal regulation of so-called ``smokeless cigarettes'' is
premature and unecessary, a tobacco company spokesman says.
   The AMA said Monday it has petitioned the Food and Drug
Administration to regulate the nicotine products, introduced last
fall by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., and to review their ingredients
and safety before they go on the market.
   Dr. Lonnie Bristow, an AMA board member, said nicotine is an
addictive, harmful drug that constricts blood vessels. Because the
Reynolds cigarette contains nicotine, he said, it should be
regulated.
   ``It promotes and maintains the nicotine addiction,'' he said in
an interview.
   ``For those individuals who have vascular disease, it is
particularly dangerous because they may be lulled into thinking
they are using a safe product,'' he said.
   But David Fishel, a spokesman for the company in Winston-Salem,
N.C., said court decisions have affirmed that cigarettes do not
come under FDA regulations, and the new product should be in the
same category.
   Fishel said the new cigarette, which generates a smaller amount
of smoke than regular cigarettes, is being tested and results will
be available to the scientific community before it is test marketed.
   ``We think it's a very uninformed, premature attempt to bring
about regulation of a product which they know very little about at
this point,'' Fishel said of the AMA petition.
   At a news conference unveiling the cigarette last September,
Reynolds Tobacco chairman and chief executive Edward Horrigan Jr.
said the company was not claiming the new product was a safe or
safer cigarette.
   He said, however, that it eliminated or greatly reduced most of
the compounds produced by burning tobacco, ``including most
compounds that are often associated with the smoking-and-health
controversy.''
   But Bristow, of San Pablo, Calif., said any impression that the
``smokeless'' cigarette is better for health is dangerous.
   ``It's sort of like saying `We won't have people dying from lung
cancer; we'll have them dying from vascular disease'' because of
nicotine's effects, Bristow said. Vascular disease affects the
arteries and veins, causing blood circulation problems.
   The Reynolds cigarette introduced in September contains tobacco
that is heated, but not burned. Nicotine is delivered to the user
through a tiny metal capsule which, when heated, produces an
aerosol resembling tobacco smoke.
   A piece of charcoal in the ``smokeless'' cigarette's end is lit
and generates the heat, Bristow said.
   R.J. Reynolds, a subsidiary of RJR Nabisco Inc., of Atlanta,
initially indicated it hoped to market-test the product this year.
   The AMA petition states that other products with nicotine, such
as gum and a non-tobacco cigarette that produces a nicotine vapor,
have come under official FDA scrutiny.
   Under federal law, the FDA has six months to respond to the AMA
petition. In a related issue, three other health groups asked the
government Monday to begin regulating low-tar cigarettes on grounds
that advertising claims for the products make them a drug subject
to federal oversight.
   The American Cancer Society, American Heart Association and
American Lung Association argued that advertisements pushing
cigarettes with low levels of tar and nicotine in essense make a
health benefit claim for those products.
   FDA spokesman Bill Gribb said the groups' petition would be
reviewed in the next few weeks.

   Israeli troops today ambushed a band of Arabs
at the Lebanese border as the guerrillas launched a raid into
Israel, the military said. Three Arabs and two Israeli soldiers
were killed.
   Two other soldiers were wounded, the army said. One was in
serious condition with a gunshot wound to the chest, hospital
authorities said.
   The Israeli army said the clash occurred 200 yards inside Israel
after troops on an early morning patrol encountered guerrillas
trying to infiltrate from Lebanon.
   However, a Lebanese police spokesman said the pre-dawn clash
occurred in Lebanese territory near the southern village of Kfar
Shouba when Israeli troops opened fire at a seven-man guerrilla
group.
   The army said soldiers chased the guerrillas through rocky
terrain and scrub brush and fought a brief battle in which the
guerrillas threw hand grenades and fired a rocket.
   The Lebanese police spokesman said the ``fierce clash'' raged
for about three hours.
   The Israelis ``fired flares at the rate of 20 every five minutes
as their helicopter gunships chased the guerrillas in the region,''
he said.
   The guerrillas were ``apparently ambushed before launching a
cross-border raid into northern Israel,'' the spokesman said. He
spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with standing
regulations.
   Israeli radio said the soldiers fought the guerrillas at a
distance of two yards but did not give the exact site of the clash.
   The Lebanese police spokesman said the guerrillas were from two
pro-Soviet groups, the Lebanese Communist Party and the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine of George Habash.
   Gen. Yossi Peled, head of northern command, identified the
guerrillas as Palestinians. However, the Lebanese Communist Party
is made up of Lebanese.
   Kfar Chuba is a small village on the slopes of biblical Mt.
Hermon, about one mile from an area where the borders of Lebanon,
Israel and Syria converge.
   The Lebanese village is inside Israel's self-designated
``security zone.'' The zone, intended to protect Israel from
attacks across the border, was created by Israel in 1985 after it
withdrew most of its forces from Lebanon. Israel had invaded
Lebanon in 1982.
   Peled said the guerrillas had targeted ``civilians, children,
Israeli settlements'' in their raid.
   The army did not say whether any guerrillas escaped. News of the
incident was held up eight hours while the border was searched.
   ``It was difficult, bushy terrain, easy to hide in,'' said a
military commander at the scene who was interviewed by Israeli
radio but not identified in keeping with army regulations.
   ``We closed off the area and chased them for several hours. They
hid in the bushes and were difficult to see,'' he said. ``They
fired first at our force and the soldiers fired back.''
   Today's incident was the 11th attempted infiltration and the
deadliest along the Lebanese border since Nov. 25 when a guerrilla
landed in northern Israel on a hang glider, entered a military base
and killed six Israeli soldiers before being shot to death himself.
   Israeli officials have linked past infiltration attempts to a
nearly five-month long Arab uprising in the occupied territories in
which 173 Palestinians and two Israelis have died.
   The two dead soldiers were the first Israeli casualties
involving Lebanon since Feb. 23, when two soldiers died when their
tank ran over a mine in south Lebanon.
   The most recent attempted infiltration was April 13, when
soldiers shot and killed three Arab guerrillas on a hostage-taking
mission.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, meanwhile, U.N. officials and news
reports said Israeli steps to break the Palestinian uprising could
temporarily block tens of thousands of Palestinians from reaching
jobs in Israel.
   Christine Dabagh, a spokeswoman for the U.N. Relief and Works
Agency, said the army was preventing people from reaching jobs by
taking their identity cards and returning them only after the Arabs
underwent lengthy checks at three government offices.
   Israeli television said the program was aimed at breaking a tax
boycott that has been a tactic of the Palestinian uprising.
   In New York, meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council condemned the
assassination of the PLO's military commander. The United States
did not use its veto, allowing the resolution to pass 14-0.
   Khalil Wazir, the No. 2 man in the Palestine Liberation
Organization, was gunned down April 16 at his home in Tunisia.
Israeli sources and Tunisian officials have said Wazir was slain by
Israeli commandos. The Israeli government has declined comment.
   Israeli leaders expressed concern about attempts by PLO leader
Yasser Arafat and Syrian President Hafez Assad to end five years of
bloody rivalry and revive a hard-line alliance against Israel.
   Assad, who expelled Arafat from Syria in 1983, met the PLO chief
on Monday in Damascus.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, back from
Moscow, is reporting to President Reagan on the slow progress in
arms control negotiations with the Soviet Union.
   Schultz was briefing Reagan at mid-afternoon.
   Unless there is an unexpected breakthrough, or a shift in
policy, a treaty to halve U.S. and Soviet strategic nuclear weapons
is unlikely to be ready for Reagan and General Secretary Mikhail S.
Gorbachev to sign when they meet in Moscow May 29 through June 2.
   The two sides are far apart on methods to verify cutbacks in
mobile missiles and cruise missiles carried on fighter planes and
warships.
   Another obstacle is Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.
   The Soviets are refusing to sign the treaty unless they have the
right to suspend reductions if they conclude that U.S. anti-missile
tests in space violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
   Shultz was unable to bridge the differences in his talks in
Moscow last week with Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze. He will see Shevardnadze again May 11-12.

<HEAD>Hail Damages Cars, But Tornado Passes Over</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms peppered 10 Alabama
counties with hail the size of tennis balls, leaving thousands of
car owners and car dealerships sizing up dents and cracked
windshields.
   ``It looks horrible,'' Frank McGough said Monday as he surveyed
the lot at Capitol Chevrolet in Montgomery.
   ``We've got close to 2,000 vehicles on our lot, and I would say
99 percent of them have some damage,'' McGough said. ``Hail is the
worst thing that can happen to an automobile dealership because it
dents all your vehicles up.''
   McGough said one employee estimated damages at close to $500,000.
   Meanwhile, officials at the Alabama Emergency Management Center
were relieved that even worse damage was avoided as tornadoes swept
across three counties without touching down.
   Tornado warnings, which mean a tornado has been spotted on
radar, were issued in Montgomery, Macon and Lee counties during the
late afternoon. By 7:30 p.m., however, the warnings had been lifted.
   Robin Hearn, a spokesman at the Montgomery-based AEMC, said
officials received numerous reports of heavy thunderstorms and
hailstorms, but that there were no reports of a tornado touching
down.
   In Lee County, an ambulance driver called emergency officials to
report winds gusting so hard that he couldn't control his vehicle.
   State troopers reported no fatalities or serious injuries
related to the storms.
   Wade Hilton, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service,
said the tornado warnings were issued after radar showed several
funnel clouds moving toward Montgomery at about 60 mph.
   ``It's like a tornado aloft, but not touching the ground,''
Hilton said.
   Hilton said hail from an inch and a half to three inches in
diameter is often produced in such a storm.
   Hearn said the emergency office had heard several descriptions
of the size of the hail. ``We've heard anything from tennis-ball
sized up to baseball-sized.''
   In Eufaula, Hearn said, officials reported ``pigeon egg-sized
hail.''
   ``I think somebody sits around and tries to think up this
terminology,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Rupert Scholz, considered a strong
backer of NATO and closer ties with the United States, has been
appointed defense minister, Chancellor Helmut Kohl announced today.
   The 50-year-old Scholz, West Berlin's minister for justice and
federal affairs, will replace Manfred Woerner next month. Woerner
will take over as the Western military alliance's secretary general
on July 1.
   Some defense experts expressed misgivings about the appointment
of Scholz. He has been a member of Kohl's governing Christian
Democratic party only since 1983 and does not sit in parliament. A
lawyer by training, he has no specific experience in military
issues.
   However, Kohl brushed aside that criticism, saying Scholz ``has
a clear understanding of political priorities and is a highly
skilled administrator.''

<HEAD>Nationwide Seizure Of Grapefruits Ordered After Poison Found In
Rome</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health authorities today ordered the seizure of all
grapefruits in Italy after tests showed that several grapefruits in
a Rome supermarket had been laced with poison.
   Italian news media said the poisoned grapefruits apparently had
been imported from Israel, although officials did not immediately
say where they were grown.
   Last week, an organization saying it was supporting the
Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories claimed it
had poisoned Israeli grapefruit on sale in Milan. Laboratory checks
at the time found no trace of poison.
   But authorities in the region of Lazio, which includes the city
of Rome, said health officials later inspected grapefruits in one
Rome supermarket after a newspaper received a threatening telephone
call.
   Of the 12 grapefruits on sale, six were found to have been
injected with a bluish poison so powerful that it immediately
killed laboratory mice, the Italian news agency ANSA said.
   The caller said he was speaking in the name of the previously
unheard of ``Organization of Metropolitan Proletarians and
Oppressed People.''
   The first seizure order was made today by health authorities in
Lazio. It was quickly followed by a national health ministry order
for the seizure of all grapefruits on sale or in warehouses around
the country.
   In Turin, the northern region of Piedmont issued a separate
announcement that ordered all Israeli-grown grapefruits seized. It
appealed to residents to destroy any grapefruits they had at home.
   Israeli-grown ``Jaffa'' grapefruit in cellophane wrappers are
sold widely around Italy.

   Carol L. Aust, 22, pleaded guilty Monday as part of an agreement
in which first-degree murder charges against her were dropped.
   She was sentenced to eight years in prison, but Baltimore County
Circuit Judge William Nickerson suspended all but two years and
credited her with the time served since her arrest in August. That
left 15 months on her sentence, to be followed by three years on
probation.
   The boy, John Wesley Manning, died Aug. 1. An autopsy found he
had bleeding in the brain caused by torn blood vessels.
   Prosecutor Mike Pulver said Ms. Aust became upset because her
boyfriend wasn't around after the baby was born, and took out her
frustrations by shaking the boy.
   ``She obviously didn't want the baby dead,'' Pulver said.

<HEAD>Ruling Sets Dangerous Precedent, Says District Attorney</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jurors who convicted former Mayor Roger
Hedgecock on perjury and conspiracy charges could be put on trial
themselves under an appeals court ruling on jury tampering
allegations, a dissenting judge said.
   Deputy Attorney General Bob Foster said Monday he will appeal a
ruling by the 4th District Court of Appeal, which ordered a lower
court to hold an evidentiary hearing on jury misconduct and jury
tampering allegations.
   Compelling former Hedgecock jurors to testify in the hearing
could create a ``colossal discouragement'' towards jury duty among
citizens, said Steve Casey, spokesman for the San Diego County
district attorney.
   ``It used to be that jurors were protected from that. The law
wanted to protect them from that kind of intimidation and
harassment,'' Casey said. ``This certainly transcends the Hedgecock
case and we're concerned about it.''
   Foster said Monday's ruling was a dangerous precedent because
the evidentiary hearing could expose jurors to subpoenas under new
trial motions.
   ``Until now, it seemed fairly clear that you could not bring a
juror (on subpoena) into a motion for a new trial in a criminal
case,'' said Foster, who litigated the appeal for the district
attorney's office. ``That's a change in the law and creates a
conflict of authority amongst published cases.''
   The dissenting judge in the 2-1 ruling agreed. Justice Edward
Butler said the decision ``authorizes a trial of jurors who return
a guilty verdict in a criminal case.''
   In the majority opinion, justices said the trial judge failed to
properly consider jury misconduct complaints by Hedgecock, who
resigned as a convicted felon on Dec. 10, 1985, two months after
his conviction.
   However, the majority opinion added: ``In our view, the evidence
fully supports the jury's conclusion that Hedgecock was part of a
conspiracy to violate the disclosure requirements of the Political
Reform Act and the local campaign finance laws.''
   Hedgecock's conviction stemmed from a campaign finance
conspiracy and coverup attempt in which hundreds of thousands of
dollars in illegal contributions went unreported on state-mandated
disclosure forms.
   Hedgecock's lawyer, Charles Sevilla, alleged in his appeal that
a bailiff made derogatory remarks within earshot of the sequestered
jurors, telling one person the former mayor was guilty and that
prosecutors would win the case ``hands down.''
   The allegations against the bailiff were cited in affidavits by
two jurors. The remaining 10 jurors and the bailiff denied the
allegations.
   The justices rejected 23 other issues raised in Sevilla's appeal.
   Hedgecock, who now works as a local radio talk show host, was
convicted in October 1985 on one count of conspiracy and 12 counts
of perjury in his second trial. His first trial ended in a mistrial
when the jury hung 11-1 in favor of conviction.
   The charges stemmed from a plot to illegally finance his
successful 1983 mayoral campaign with more than $350,000 from the
now-defunct J. David & Co. investment firm.
   Hedgecock was sentenced to a year in jail and three years
probation and fined $1,000, but has remained free pending his
appeal. He is vacationing in Brazil this week.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Rose Mofford says she will file
amended financial disclosure statements listing land, loans and
partnerships to avoid ``additional doubts and nitpicking.''
   But former Gov. Evan Mecham, who faces criminal charges over
alleged omissions on his statements, notes that amending his
statements didn't help him.
   A top aide to Attorney General Bob Corbin said meanwhile that
his office was looking into Mrs. Mofford's original filings and
that ``under the circumstances now'' it could not give Mrs. Mofford
advice.
   Lawmakers said they would prefer to leave matters in Corbin's
hands, but some left open the possibility of another legislative
investigation, similar to the one that led to Mecham's impeachment.
   ``We'll just have to wait until the A.G. says,'' said House
Speaker Joe Lane, who initiated the Mecham investigation after
Corbin confirmed that Mecham's activities were being scrutinized by
a grand jury. ``I just hope she gets everything fixed up.''
   Mrs. Mofford's office, in a written statement, said she hoped to
file the changes by the end of the week but needed more time to
research them.
   The Associated Press reported last week that Mrs. Mofford had
not listed land, loan and partnership transactions on the public
officer reporting forms that she was in charge of during her 10
years as Secretary of State.
   Mrs. Mofford said that many of the transactions stemmed from
arrangements made by her former husband and that she had not
profited from them.
   ``I'm not trying to hide anything,'' she said at the time,
adding that everything was reported on her income-tax forms. She
declined to make the returns public.
   Mrs. Mofford married T.R. Mofford in 1957. They were divorced 10
years later, but the governor says they remained good friends until
T.R. died in 1983.
   On Monday, the governor reiterated her position.
   ``I still question whether the law requires that these items be
disclosed, but I wish to avoid even the appearance of
impropriety,'' she said. ``Arizona has been through enough without
additional doubts and nitpicking.''
   But Mecham, read Mrs. Mofford's statement, laughed and said ``I
love it'' when he got to the passage about doubts and nitpicking.
   ``I don't see any place in the (reporting) law where it says you
have to make any profit,'' he added, saying that the transaction he
is accused of concealing _ a $350,000 campaign loan _ did not
involve any profit to him.
   Mrs. Mofford said she would ask Corbin to determine whether the
items should have been included on her disclosure forms ``so that
his advice can be available to her and to other public officials
faced with questions,'' her office said.
   Corbin was out of town Monday, but chief assistant Attorney
General Steve Twist said his agency planned to review records of
the transactions.
   ``Under the circumstances now, it would not be appropriate for
us to give any personal advice to the governor,'' Twist said.

<TEXT>
   A government commission said Panama's
banks can immediately resume some operations suspended nearly two
months ago, but customers will not be allowed to withdraw
much-needed cash.
   The National Banking Commission said Monday that banks can
resume offering a dozen services that were suspended following the
imposition of U.S. economic sanctions aimed at ousting strongman
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   In another development, an opposition leader said Monday that a
group of Panamanian dissidents is planning to undertake a military
operation against Noriega by the beginning of next week.
   Ambassador Juan B. Sosa, who has maintained his loyalty to
ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle, told reporters the group is
made up of officers who have supporters in the Panamanian Defense
Forces.
   Sosa gave no details, but the group apparently is comprised of
high-ranking defectors from the Defense Forces who came to the
United States shortly after Delvalle's ouster two months ago.
   A coup attempt against Noriega last month was put down quickly.
   The New York Times, meanwhile, quoted an unidentified official
in Washington as saying the sweeping U.S. economic sanctions were a
mistake and that they will be relaxed ``within a week or so.''
   The Times today quoted the official as saying that the Treasury
Department, charged with enforcing the sanctions, was considering a
long list of exemptions.
   In New York, Panama's newly appointed foreign minister on Monday
said his top priorities are normalizing relations with the United
States and persuading it to lift the economic sanctions. The
minister, Jorge E. Ritter, made the comment in an interview at the
United Nations in New York.
   The National Banking Commission said the services banks can now
resume include handling letters of credit, transferring funds
within the country, collecting outstanding loans and currency and
metals exchanges.
   Although customers will not be allowed to withdraw cash, the
panel called the resumption of services ``an important and decisive
step'' toward normal banking operations.
   The cash crisis has become so severe in Panama that many people
have been forced to resort to bartering to obtain food for their
families.
   Panamanian banks were ordered shut March 4 because there was not
enough cash to cover withdrawals. Some banks reopened on April 18,
but only to accept deposits. The closures followed U.S. sanctions
that included the freezing of Panamanian funds held in American
accounts and the withholding of Panama Canal toll fees normally
paid to the government.
   The sanctions helped create a liquidity crisis in Panama, which
uses the U.S. dollar as its official currency. The Reagan
administration hoped they would help oust Noriega, head of Panama's
15,000-member Defense Forces.
   Noriega, the power behind the civilian government, is under
indictment in the United States on drug trafficking charges. He
denies the charges.
   Panama's civilian chief executive, Manuel Solis Palma, said on
Monday that he will talk with domestic opponents of the government
only if they dropped calls for Noriega's resignation.
   ``What we will not do is surrender before the start of battle,''
Solis Palma told reporters. Opposition leaders rejected an offer of
negotiations with the government in March, saying Noriega must
leave first.

<HEAD>Swiss And U.S. Say Iran Ambassador Question Settled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERN, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Switzerland said today that it would
not reconsider its decision to accept the new Iranian ambassador
despite allegations from Washington that he played a key role in
the 1979-1980 Tehran hostage crisis.
   A Swiss Foreign Ministry statement made it clear that despite
U.S. opposition the Swiss government would accept Sayid Mohammad
Hussein Malaek as ambassador.
   The four-sentence statement followed a meeting between U.S.
Ambassador Faith Ryan Whittlesey and State Secretary Edouard
Brunner at which both sides presented their views in the case.
   ``Thus, both sides consider the question as settled,'' it said.
   ``We agree that the question is settled but we remain
disappointed,'' said Michael Korff, a U.S. Embassy spokesman.
   In a separate press statement, Mrs. Whittlesay said ``all
aspects of the recent press reports concerning the U.S.
government's interest'' in Malaek were reviewed at today's meeting.
   ``We have no intention of allowing our disappointment in this
matter to complicate the excellent relations that continue to exist
between the United States and Switzerland,'' the statement said.
   Switzerland has been representing U.S. diplomatic interests in
Iran since Washington severed ties with Iran following the November
1979 seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. Fifty-two Americans
were held hostage by Iranian militants for 444 days.
   The Neue Zurcher Zeitung newspaper said Monday that Brunner
planned to reiterate at his meeting that Switzerland does not have
sufficient evidence to reject Malaek, who presented his credentials
March 22.
   The newspaper said the ``Americans failed to present the Swiss
authorities with a dossier compiling the evidence allegedly
incriminating Malaek.''
   Korff said Friday that Malaek's role as one of the leaders in
the hostage-taking was so well known that fou Western countries
refused to accept him as envoy.
   The Neue Zuercher Zeitung said Korff was referring to Britain,
Canada, Japan and the United States. Citing Swiss sources, it said
the Canadians told the Foreign Ministry that they cannot recall any
request by Malaek for accreditation. In Britain, the Iranian
Embassy is headed by a charge d'affaires who does not require
accreditation. The newspaper said there was also ``no substantial
information from Tokyo.''

   Saudi Arabia was expected to announce today it
is breaking diplomatic relations with Iran in response to Iranian
attacks on shipping in the Persian Gulf.
   According to an informed source, who requested anonymity, the
Saudi council of ministers took the decision at a meeting Monday
night.
   The Saudis, like most of the Arab countries, is supporting Iraq
in its war with Iran.
   The United States, already protecting Kuwaiti oil tankers flying
the U.S. flag, may extend the protection to neutral shipping.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz confirmed Monday in Brussels
a decision was under consideration. He declined to say whether the
request for broader U.S. involvement in the ``tanker war'' in the
Gulf had come from the Saudis.

   Bank error in your favor: Collect $20 for every

   They weren't playing Monopoly, but some Manhattan bank customers
were able to take advantage of just such a chance when a cash
machine went berserk over the weekend.
   If you asked the First Federal Savings and Loan Association of
Rochester cash machine for $40 on Sunday, you got $160; if you
asked for $60, you got $240. Etcetera. And accounts were charged
only for the amounts requested.
   A line of eager card holders quickly formed at the machine when
customers discovered the flaw.
   ``I called everybody I knew,'' a writer who asked not to be
identified for fear of prosecution told New York Newsday.
   First Federal said it would try to track down customers once it
determined how much was lost and who was making withdrawals while
the machine was in the giving mood. Bank cash machines in the city
typically hold about $100,000.
   Elizabeth Taylor, vice president of the New York Cash Exchange,
a cash machine network, said such malfunctions are rare. The last
such give-away in metropolitan New York occurred three years ago,
she said.
   Although the cash machine panel has a telephone for reporting
emergency problems, the response was not overwhelming. The branch
manager reported getting one call _ Monday morning.

<TEXT>
   Three Georgia ministers have been released
on bond and ordered to appear in Virginia for trial on federal
charges of transporting young boys across state lines for
prostitution.
   U.S. Magistrate William L. Slaughter on Monday ordered the
release of Pentecostal ministers Tony Leyva, 41, of Columbus; Rias
Edward Morris, 47, an organist in Leyva's Columbus church; and
Freddie M. Herring, 49, of Douglasville, Ga., on $20,000 unsecured
bonds each.
   A federal grand jury in Roanoke, Va., charged Leyva, Morris and
Herring with taking young boys under age 18 across state lines for
prostitution between May 1983 and July 1987.
   The FBI began an investigation after receiving complaint from
police in Roanoke.
   Leyva had spent the weekend in jail and Sunday services at his
church were canceled, although staff members and supporters held an
informal afternoon service.
   ``The minister is an innocent man who's been falsely accused,''
said David Henderson, director of operations for the Tony Leyva
Evangelistic Association. ``He will be cleared of all charges. It's
just a matter of time.''
   Also canceled Sunday was Leyva's television program on Columbus'
independent station WXTX. General manager Gary Hlavacek said he has
not yet decided whether to terminate the show.
   ``I said we better pull the program for today, then go from
there,'' Hlavacek said.
   Leyva's program had taken a time slot formerly held by
evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, who was defrocked earlier this year
after a sex scandal involving charges that he had visited motels
with prostitutes.
   Hlavacek said Swaggart's program was canceled because of
financial problems, not because of the sex scandal.

   Michael Dukakis aimed today to add
Pennsylvania to the string of primary victories propelling him
toward the Democratic presidential nomination, while Vice President
George Bush expected to lock up the Republican nomination.
   Jesse Jackson counted on large turnouts in the state's two
biggest cities to give him a shot at an upset victory over Dukakis
in the non-binding popularity vote that was part of a long, complex
primary ballot.
   But Democratic front-runner Dukakis was virtually assured of
capturing a solid majority of the 178 convention delegates at stake
in the primary and add to his growing lead in the two-man race for
the nomination.
   ``The turnout is light this morning,'' said Allegheny County
Elections Director James Scanlon. But he added, ``I think the
weather will help a lot. It's going to be a beautiful day.''
   In northwestern Pennsylvania, Erie County Elections Supervisor
Mary Ann Edler said polling places reported good turnout.
   ``The weather is sunshiny,'' she said. `` It's beautiful. The
turnout's been fantastic this morning.''
   Meanwhile, Jackson got high praise from former President Carter
who appeared on the ABC show, ``Good Morning America'' and said the
former civil rights activist would be ``amazingly attractive'' on
the Democratic ticket.
   The former president said Jackson's ``attractiveness and the
quality of his campaign has been amazing'' and ``it's much easier
to say very honestly that Jackson would be amazingly attractive on
the ticket compared to what everybody thought he would do before
this campaign started.''
   Bush, campaigning today in Lima, Ohio, had critical words for
the former president, saying that Democrats would return the
country ``to the malaise days of Carter.''
   During the Carter administration, Bush said, ``there wasn't a
malaise. There was a lack of leadership. I want to build on our
outstanding record.''
   All the candidates wound up their Pennsylvania campaigning on
Monday and Jackson and Bush scheduled appearances today in Ohio,
the next big state on the primary schedule. Dukakis was back in the
governor's office in Massachusetts.
   With 1,081 delegates in the latest Associated Press tally, Bush
was only 58 short of the 1,139 needed for a majority at the
Republican National Convention in August. His only active opponent,
former television evangelist Pat Robertson, has 31.
   Pennsylvania elects 78 Republican delegates, giving the vice
president a strong chance to get his majority when the results come
in tonight.
   Dukakis has put together a string of primary victories in
Wisconsin, Connecticut and New York to knock out all opposition but
Jackson and build the impression that his nomination is inevitable.
   Dukakis was more than halfway toward a delegate majority,
holding 1,075.15 national convention votes. Jackson has 836.1 while
602.75 are uncommitted. A tally of 2,081 or more is needed to win
the nomination at the July convention in Atlanta.
   Dukakis, with a overwhelming victory in Monday night's Utah
caucuses, also would win 19 of the 23 delegates from that state if
late results hold up. With 90 percent of the legislative districts
reporting, Dukakis had 71 percent of the vote and Jackson had 17
percent, a total that would leave him with four delegates.
   About 11 percent of the Utah Democrats voted in the caucuses to
remain uncommitted.
   Ohio, Indiana and the District of Columbia hold primaries next
Tuesday.
   During campaign appearances on Monday, Dukakis sounded as though
he felt his strongest opponent was overconfidence.
   He urged supporters to ignore the polls that said he held a wide
lead in the state. ``Pollsters don't vote,'' he said.
   The Massachusetts governor also took pains to explain the
complicated ballot.
   ``It isn't enough just to vote for me,'' he told a rally in
Erie. ``This is one election where you've got to vote more than
once and it's legal. I need your vote as a candidate. Our delegates
need your votes. ... We must do both.''
   While he and Jackson staged a long-distance debate over policy
toward terrorists, jobs was the major theme at Dukakis appearances.
   ``Make no mistake about it,'' he said. ``I'm a dyed-in-the-wool,
true-blue, full-employment Democrat.''
   Jackson also talked about jobs when he spoke to striking workers
at a British Petroleum Corp. refinery outside Philadelphia.
   Jackson said profits at the company were up 400 percent last
year and said, ``For profits to be up and wages down is greedy and
unfair.''
   He told the strikers, ``I know it's tough, but hold on. I know
it's tough, but Reaganomics is on the way out.''
   He also referred to articles saying that Dukakis was
appropriating many of his campaign themes.
   ``Well, No. 1, that ratifies my leadership,'' he said. ``But
since he got my message, don't choose margarine, choose butter,
choose the real thing.''
   Bush toured a job-retraining center in Pittsburgh and praised
``the combination of initiatives on the local level.''
   On the question of dealings with terrorists, Dukakis and Jackson
agreed that it was proper to talk with people who were holding
Americans hostage in an effort to get their freedom.
   But Dukakis said, ``You never make concessions to terrorists _
ever.''
   Jackson rejected what he called ``material concessions'' to
terrorists. But he said he could envision situations where he would
agree to allow safe passage to hostage-takers and added, ``I choose
negotiation over blind, bloody confrontation.''

   A convoy of U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers,
the first since last week's clash between U.S. and Iranian naval
forces, headed into the Persian Gulf today but turned back because
of uncertainties about mines, shipping executives said.
   The executives, speaking on condition they not be identified,
said a sandstorm over the gulf restricted visibility of helicopters
and mine-hunting vessels accompanying the two tankers and their
U.S. Navy escorts.
   A source close to the Kuwait Oil Tanker Co. said, however, that
the convoy might get under way again within 24 hours.
   U.S. officials conceded earlier that the convoys were falling
behind schedule because of concern about mines laid by Iran in the
central gulf and the threat of Iranian missile attacks in the
Strait of Hormuz, the narrow entrance to the waterway.
   The U.S. guided missile frigate Samuel B. Roberts was damaged by
a mine on April 14, and about a dozen mines were later found in
international waters used by commercial shipping.
   American military sources said six of the 11 Kuwaiti tankers
reflagged by the United States last year have been waiting in the
anchorage in the Gulf of Oman, departure point for the U.S-escorted
convoys, for the past week.
   Two had been ready to move since April 15 and the other four
arrived over the next few days, creating what one officer called an
``unprecedented traffic jam'' off the port of Khor Fakkan.
   A seventh tanker, the 46,723-ton liquefied gas carrier Gas King,
arrived at Kuwait on April 10. It has been stranded there, loaded
but unable to sail down the gulf, because of what the source close
to Kuwait Oil Tanker Co. called U.S. ``reticence'' to risk the mine
hazard. The Kuwait Oil Tanker Co. owns the reflagged ships.
   The company source said the decision to send the tankers to
Kuwait reflected a belief by U.S. and Kuwaiti officials that the
minefield was clear and the missile threat was not serious enough
to warrant further delays.
   ``British and French convoys have gone through the mine danger
area without trouble,'' he said.
   The mine strike against the Roberts caused the United States to
retaliate against Iran.
   On April 18, the U.S. Navy sank or damaged six Iranian gunboats
and three Navy warships came under Iranian missile attack in the
Strait of Hormuz, but were not hit.
   A spokesman for the U.S. Central Command said here that he could
provide no information on the convoy movement.
   The United States customarily does not confirm the movement of
Kuwaiti tanker convoys escorted by U.S. warships until they have
passed specific danger points in the gulf.
   Today's convoy was sighted on radar by coastal observers in the
southern gulf. They were unable to identify the ships involved.
   U.S. officials in Washington had denied last week that the
escort operations had been suspended.

   Transit workers in Bydgoszcz were back
on the job today after shutting down bus and streetcar service for
11 hours in a rare show of labor unrest by a government-sanctioned
union.
   The bus and streetcar drivers ended their walkout Monday by
agreeing to hourly pay raises of about 60 percent, the chairman of
the official union said.
   ``People are not satisfied but this is sufficient for them at
the moment,'' said Harald Matuszewski.
   The sudden walkout in this western Poland city forced thousands
of people to walk to work and school Monday.
   A spokeswoman for the official transport workers union, one of
the labor groups put together by the government after the activist
trade union Solidarity was banned in the 1981 martial law
crackdown, said the strike even took union leaders by surprise.
   ``It was an initiative of the drivers,'' she said.
   Buses and streetcars rolled again at about 5.30 p.m. on Monday.
   Workers negotiated with a deputy mayor and a deputy provicial
governor at a streetcar depot in Bydgoszcz, the spokeswoman said.
   The union spokeswoman said hourly pay will increase by 12 cents
to 33 cents. One driver said he now earns the equivalent of $75 to
$90 a month and expects his pay to be about $25 more.
   Solidarity founder Lech Walesa had said earlier he would go to
Bydgoszcz in support of the strikers, but he remained at home in
Gdansk, apparently because of the settlement.
   Pressure for pay increases has grown because prices of many
necessities have gone up 42 percent this year under an economic
reform program instituted by the communist government.
   According to official figures, wages had risen about 45 percent
by April 1.
   Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the Polish leader, told managers of
state enterprises last month they risked dismissal if they were too
generous with wage increases.
   Meanwhile, two Solidarity leaders at a heavy machinery plant in
southeast Poland were fired because of a protest rally last week,
and workers there are threatening to strike, an opposition
spokesman said today.
   Wieslaw Wojtas, chairman of the founding committee of the
plant's Solidarity local, and Wieslaw Turasz, a committee member,
were dismissed Monday from their jobs at the Stalowa Wola mills,
said Ewa Kaberna, a Solidarity activist in the city.
   She said workers ``announced a strike alert and are preparing a
general strike,'' but she did not know when it might take place.
   Opposition spokesman said about 5,000 workers took part in the
rally the start of the afternoon shift at the sprawling plant in
Stalowa Wola, about 95 miles southeast of Warsaw. The plant employs
18,000 workers.

<HEAD>World Court Rules Against U.S. Attempt To Shut PLO Mission</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND DE LIGNY</BYLINE>

   The World Court today ruled
against the United States' attempt to shut down the Palestine
Liberation Organization's mission in New York.
   The ruling implicitly condemned the U.S. move to close the PLO
mission to the United Nations by supporting the U.N. position that
the dispute must be submitted to independent arbitration.
   The ruling was the court's second decision against the United
States in two years.
   In 1986, the U.N.'s judicial arm condemned as a violation of
international law the Reagan administration's support for the
rebels fighting Nicaragua's Sandinista government.
   The World Court, officially known as the International Court of
Justice, has no enforcement powers and depends on voluntary
adherence to its rulings.
   The PLO office dispute emanates from American anti-terrorist
legislation signed into law by President Reagan last December. The
legislation aims at closing the PLO's 14-year-old observer mission
to the United Nations in New York.
   The law classifies the PLO as a ``terrorist organization,'' and
bars it from operating on U.S. territory. The PLO's information
office in Washington, D.C. was closed down prior to the passage of
the legislation.
   The attempt to shut down the PLO Mission in New York has been
condemned by all U.N. member nations except the United States and
Israel, as well as by the U.N. administration. The U.S. State
Department also opposed the law.
   Briefs on the case have been filed by the United Nations and the
U.S. government, as well as by Syria and East Germany. Although
their contents are confidential, the East German and Syrian briefs
are widely considered to support the PLO position.
   Because only sovereign states and U.N. bodies are entitled to
bring cases before the court, the PLO was unable to plead its case
before the 15-judge panel.
   At the request of the U.N. General Assembly, Secretary General
Javier Perez de Cuellar filed the court case March 9 in the form of
a request for a legal opinion on whether the dispute is subject to
arbitration.
   The so-called Headquarters Agreement, a 1947 pact between the
Truman Administration and the U.N., specifies that disputes are
subject to arbitration by a three-member panel.
   Under that treaty, diplomats of U.N. member nations and
organizations with observer status are guaranteed the right to
operate in New York.
   The Reagan administration has rejected independent arbitration
in the case as premature, noting the PLO case is under review by a
federal court in the United States.
   But in its submissions to the court, the Reagan administration
has also said that the anti-terrorist law calls for closing the PLO
Mission ``irrespective of any international legal obligations that
the United States may have under the Headquarters Agreement.''
   The PLO was accorded permanent observer status at the United
Nations in 1974 and has maintained an office in Manhattan since
then.

<HEAD>Lawyer Says He Will Raise Bullet Issue In New Appeal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bullet lodged in Paul Rougeau's buttocks since
a robbery a decade ago is expected to surface again as an issue in
attempts to keep Rougeau from being executed.
   The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to consider a death row
appeal based on prosecutors' remarks about the bullet during
Rougeau's 1978 murder trial, but lawyer Steven Thorpe says he will
raise the issue again in a different form.
   Rougeau refused to let doctors remove the slug after the robbery
and shooting death. Prosecutors told the jury trying him for
capital murder in the death of Deputy Constable A.C. Wilkins that
Rougeau probably feared the bullet would be identified as having
come from the dead officer's gun.
   Thorpe contended in his appeal that state District Judge Jon N.
Hughes violated the defendant's Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination by permitting the remarks.
   The Supreme Court declined to hear those arguments, but Thorpe
said he will file a new appeal claiming that the mention of the
bullet violated Rougeau's Fourth Amendment right against
unreasonable search and seizure.
   A 1985 Supreme Court ruling held that suspects have a
constitutional right to refuse to have a bullet surgically removed,
and in general, prosecutors ``may not use against you the fact that
you invoked your constitutional rights,'' Thorpe said.
   He noted that prosecutors may not tell jurors that a defendant
refused to talk to police.
   The Supreme Court has tried to strike a balance between
protecting suspects against deeply intrusive acts such as forced
surgery while still allowing police to get the evidence they need
by such lesser measures as taking fingerprints or samples of hair,
blood or skin, all of which are permitted, Thorpe said.
   But state Assistant Attorney General Robert Walt said federal
courts generally will not rehear cases in which appeal is based on
search and seizure issues that the defense has had a previous
opportunity to raise.
   Wilkins was working as a security guard at Houston's Stock
Exchange Club Jan. 6, 1978, when it was held up by three men.
   Rougeau's brother Joseph, 30, was killed in a shoot-out with
police. The third man, Gillis Guillory, 27, later pleaded guilty to
murder and testified against Rougeau in return for a 40-year
sentence.
   Guillory testified he saw Rougeau standing over Wilkins.
   ``The officer asked Paul not to shoot him again,'' Guillory
said, but Rougeau replied, ``Die like you should'' and pulled the
trigger again.

   Immigration officials have a unique 103rd
birthday gift for an elderly alien who once helped Mexican forces
hunt outlaw Pancho Villa.
   Officials from the Immigration and Naturalization Office will be
in this border city 90 miles north of Laredo this afternoon to
present Francisca Rivera de Chavez with legal residence in the
United States.
   ``She's still very alert, but she can't get to a legalization
office,'' said John Armistad, spokesman for the agency's Dallas
office.
   In February, the INS restored legal status to Clara Escobedo
Martinez, 98, whose green card was canceled by immigration
officials in 1962. The INS reduced the number of years normally
necessary to get citizenship in her case and Mrs. Escobedo became
the first amnesty applicant granted citizenship on April 8.
   Mrs. Escobedo has been making television commercials for the INS
to urge other aliens who qualify to apply for amnesty.
   Under new immigration laws, aliens who have lived continuously
in the United States since 1982 are eligible for amnesty and later
citizenship.
   Mrs. Chavez was born May 8, 1885, in Concepcion del Oro in
Jalisco, Mexico, and is the widow of Maj. Rafael Chavez, a soldier
in the Mexican forces during the Mexican Revolution. Mrs. Chavez
provided information to her husband's troops on Villa's activities
in the Piedras Negras area, Armistad said.
   After her husband died in 1937, Mrs. Chavez moved to the United
States to work in restaurants in Houston and Los Angeles, the INS
said.
   Usually, amnesty applicants must wait six years before receiving
an application for citizenship, but officials speeded up the
process for Mrs. Escobedo. Armistad said he expects the same will
be done for Mrs. Chavez.
   Mrs. Chavez is the mother of 12 children and has 55
grandchildren, 112 great-grandchildren and four
great-great-grandchildren.
   She lives with a daughter in this South Texas town.

   Layoffs have forced the temporary
closing of the city's treasurer's office because the city's primary
bank account held only $884, officials said.
   Twenty-five layoffs took effect Monday and included all of
Treasurer Charlotte R. Moore's regular workers.
   ``They laid off my administrative assistant and two
accountants,'' as well as four other workers, Ms. Moore said.
``They didn't leave anyone in here.''
   Three workers from other departments were transferred into the
treasurer's office, but Ms. Moore said accountants and account
clerks were replaced with clerk-typists and reference clerks.
   Ms. Moore said a city payroll of about $230,000 is scheduled to
be paid Friday. But even with an expected infusion of state
sales-tax receipts during the week, the city could still not have
enough to pay its workers, she said.
   East St. Louis is plagued by a dwindling industrial base, high
unemployment, crime and a growing municipal debt.
   The city also faces a $4 million judgment awarded last year to a
man who suffered brain damage when he was beaten by a cellmate in
the city jail. The company that had handled municipal trash
collection filed suit last fall over $262,000 in unpaid bills. And
last month the city pleaded innocent to charges that it is
endangering its police officers with inadequate equipment.
   Layoffs were recommended two weeks ago by the city's Government
Operations Committee in an effort to cut costs to meet payroll and
pay city debts, including a $29,000 monthly garbage contract and a
monthly $20,000 payment on the lawsuit judgment.
   Officials have said they must trim about $144,000 a month from
the budget to keep the municipality from going bankrupt.

<TEXT>
   A tenant whose rent-controlled apartment was
demolished around him will get $2.9 million from the landlord for
damages and harassment, a Manhattan jury has decided.
   The jury made the award Monday to Emilio Bellitti, a retired
garment industry worker who has lived in a $350-a-month,
two-bedroom apartment for 35 years.
   Bellitti's lawyer, Stuart Gruskin, said his client and the
building's six other tenants were asked in 1983 to leave so the
house could be gutted and renovated. Bellitti and his now-dead
roommate, Victor Rizika, refused.
   Gruskin said that in the summer of 1984, the landlords, Suzanne
and Robert Lavanant, gutted the building with Bellitti still there.
   ``During demolition, the ceilings and walls in my client's
apartment collapsed,'' Gruskin said. ``Fortunately, he was not
physically injured.''
   ``They couldn't get him out legally so they decided to just try
to drive him out by going ahead with work,'' the lawyer said.
   Gruskin said that in April 1985 he reached agreement with the
Lavanants, owners of about eight buildings in Manhattan, to rebuild
Bellitti's apartment, but proceeded with the suit anyhow ``because
of the way the landlord ignored my client's rights.''
   After a six-day trial and two days of deliberations, the jury of
three men and three women awarded Bellitti $400,000 in compensatory
damages, a rent abatement worth about $6,000, and $2.5 million in
punitive damages for the landlord's ``reckless disregard of the
tenants' safety,'' Gruskin said.
   The lawyer said Rizika, also a retired garment industry worker,
died in October 1986. He said his legal status regarding the award
is not clear yet.

<HEAD>Inmate's Broken Toilet Complaint Revived</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court said today that a
State Penitentiary inmate whose cell toilet was broken for 37 days
may have grounds for a claim of cruel and unusual punishment.
   A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
returned inmate Melvin C. Wilson's complaint to U.S. District Court
in Norfolk for further review.
   Judge Richard B. Kellam had ruled in favor of Warden Michael C.
Samberg on the commode claim, as well as other issues raised by
Wilson.
   Wilson alleged, in addition to the toilet and other complaints,
that a lockdown at the downtown Richmond prison was unlawful, that
he was denied food, that he was illegally put in punitive
confinement and that meals were unsanitary and insufficient.
   The appeals panel upheld Kellam on all points but the broken
toilet, which Wilson said caused sewage to flood his cell. Wilson
also said he was denied cleaning materials and that his meals
during a lockdown were slid under his cell bars through raw sewage.
   Samberg, in an affidavit, said he was not aware of any waste in
Wilson's cell and that the delay in fixing the toilet was caused by
having to wait for ordered parts.
   ``Wilson's description of his broken commode, if taken as true,
may well state a claim for cruel and unusual punishment,'' the
appeals panel said in returning the case to the lower court for a
determination of the facts.
   Wilson, 44, is serving two life sentences plus 46 years for
murder, robbery and other convictions. His sentence began in April
1970.

<HEAD>Strikes Reported At Steel Plant in Southern Poland</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES thruout with reported work stoppages in Nowa Huta

<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 4,000 workers at the Lenin steel
mill near Krakow in southern Poland refused to work today because
they want higher wages, opposition spokesmen said.
   Workers at a big heavy machinery plant in southeast Poland,
meanwhile, threatened a strike today after two Solidarity leaders
were fired for leading a protest rally there last week, members of
the banned trade union federation said.
   According to Ryszard Bocian, a Solidarity activist in Krakow,
the strike at the Lenin mill in the Krakow suburb of Nowa Huta
began this morning in three departments of the plant and spread
later to a fourth.
   A spokesman at the office of government spokesman Jerzy Urban
said only 900 workers went on strike.
   A spokeswoman at the plant office told The Associated Press that
no one authorized to comment was available.
   The reported job action came one day after an 11-hour strike by
2,800 transit workers in the western Polish city of Bydgoszcz
achieved a wage increase for bus and tram drivers. The strike was
reported in Polish newspapers and on television.
   The Nowa Huta steel workers seek pay increases of $30 a month,
Bocian said. He said the strike was launched by Maciej Mach, a
Solidarity activist.
   One worker reached at the plant by telephone, who identified
himself only as an electronics engineer, said workshops were idle
and talks with management representatives continued.
   ``The situation in Poland is getting hotter and hotter. Anything
can happen anyplace,'' Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa told
reporters today in an impromptu news conference at the Norwegian
embassy in Warsaw. He met there privately with visiting Foreign
Minister Thorvald Stoltenberg of Norway.
   Asked about the Bydgoszcz strike, which was led by members of
the officially sanctioned trade union and not by Solidarity, he
said: ``It doesn't matter what you are a member of. People are
fighting to improve their lives.''
   Solidarity was declared illegal after the 1981 martial-law
crackdown in Poland, although its leadership has managed to remain
active. The government later organized an officially sanctioned
trade union alliance, whose unions now claim 7 million members.
   Urban, at his weekly news conference, said that under Poland's
program of economic reform, decisions on pay no longer will be made
by the central government. He said factory managers themselves will
have to decide how much their enterprises can afford to pay.
   The government says prices in Poland rose 42 percent in the
first three months of 1988, and wages climbed by 45 percent in the
same period. Government officials have expressed concern that wages
are growing too quickly and will spur even more inflation.
   At the Stalowa Wola heavy machinery plant in southeast Poland,
Wieslaw Wojtas, chairman of the founding committee of that plant's
Solidarity local, and Wieslaw Turasz, a committee member, were
fired Monday afternoon, said Ewa Kaberna, a Solidarity activist in
the city.
   She said workers ``announced a strike alert and are preparing a
general strike'' to protest the firings. She said she did not know
when the job action would take place.
   Opposition spokesmen said Wojtas and Turasz led about 5,000
workers in a rally before the start of the afternoon shift Thursday
at the sprawling plant in Stalowa Wola, about 95 miles southeast of
Warsaw. The plant employs 18,000 workers.
   Ms. Kaberna said Wojtas read a speech at the rally listing the
Solidarity committee's demands, including across-the-board pay
raises of $50 a month.

<HEAD>3,000 to 30,000 Deaths Predicted from Chernobyl Fallout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dr. Robert Gale, an American leukemia
specialist who treated victims of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear plant
disaster in the Soviet Union, predicted today that 3,000 to 30,000
people will die of cancer as a result of that accident.
   He also said he expected another major nuclear accident
``somewhere in the world in the next 25 years, maybe in the next 10
years.''
   Gale's forecast was a revision of his prediction a year ago that
there would be as many as 75,000 Chernobyl cancer deaths.
   Last year, British radiologists said they expected that the
delayed effect of the radiation would add about 1,000 deaths to the
estimated 30 million cancer deaths that can be expected to occur in
Western Europe in the next 50 years.
   ``We're predicting at the moment somewhere between 3,000 and
maybe as many as 30,000 extra deaths from cancer over the next 50
years,'' Gale said.
   He was interviewed from Boston on CBS' ``This Morning'' on the
occasion of the second anniversary of Chernobyl and the publication
of his book, ``Final Warning: The Legacy of Chernobyl.''
   Half of the Chernobyl fatalities will occur outside the Soviet
Union, mostly in Eastern and Western Europe, Gale said.
   ``When you have an accident in one of these power plants, it's
an international event,'' he said. ``And, it's always going to
happen that at least half of the events are going to occur outside
of the country of the accident. We're all in this together in a
nuclear age.''

   Raw sewage is pouring into the Chattahoochee
River from an Atlanta treatment plant and Georgia officials have
warned municipalities downstream in both Georgia and Alabama.
   Ruptured pipes at the R.M. Clayton Water Pollution Control Plant
forced officials to start dumping untreated sewage into the
Chattahoochee on Sunday.
   By midday today, the total spill was expected to exceed 180
million gallons.
   State officials took water samples at several locations Monday
in an effort to determine how quickly the sewage was moving
downstream and how serious the environmental damage might be.
   ``I would certainly not want to fall in the water,'' said Gib
Johnston, a spokesman for the state Department of Natural Resources.
   In three cities downstream _ LaGrange, West Point and Columbus _
officials have been warned to take precautions to ensure that their
drinking water is safe. Officials in Alabama, which borders the
west bank of the Chattahoochee, also were advised of the situation.
   Untreated sewage may contain large quantities of disease-causing
bacteria and other microorganisms. The waste also can rob the river
water of dissolved oxygen, which is necessary to fish and other
aquatic organisms.
   Pumps were moved into the treatment plant Monday to remove 30
feet of water from the basement and sub-basement, where the
ruptured pipes were located. The plant's own pumps were flooded and
unable to function.
   City officials said it might take three or four days to fix the
broken pipes and halt the spill.

   An argument over a broken car windshield
ended in the fatal shooting of a Jackson State football player,
authorities said.
   Hinds County Coroner Robert Martin said an autopsy showed Lerome
Brown, 24, bled to death after he was shot in the chest Monday
outside the campus union.
   Chauncy Wright, 23, also a student, has been charged with murder
in the noontime shooting and is being held at the Hinds County Jail.
   Wright allegedly broke Brown's windshield on Saturday, said
Jerry Jackson, acting director of public information at Jackson
State, and on Monday the two were ``fussing about who was going to
repair the broken windshield.''
   Brown, a Jackson State running back from 1982 to 1985, was shot
with a small-caliber handgun, authorities said.

   Israel today temporarily withdrew the press
credentials of two foreign correspondents because they reported
details of the assassination of a PLO leader without submitting the
reports to military censors, the reporters said.
   Glenn Frankel of the Washington Post and Martin Fletcher of NBC
News were required to hand over their credentials today to the
Government Press Office.
   Fletcher, quoting Israeli sources, reported that Israel was
responsible for the April 16 killing of Khalil Wazir, better known
as Abu Jihad.
   Frankel later reported details on the operation. He also quoted
Israeli sources.
   Israeli sources have confirmed that Israel carried out the
assassination. The government has declined comment.
   The correspondents said they were told by press office head
Yoram Ettinger that their credentials, which journalists need to
cover government officials, were revoked pending an investigation.
   Israeli law requires journalists to submit reports relating to
security matters to military censors. The government has given a
broad definition to security matters and has left submitting the
reports to the correspondents' discretion.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir expressed anger Monday over the
correspondents' reports.
   ``They (the journalists) should be punished,'' he was quoted as
saying on Israel radio.
   ``It's natural that there are conflicts between any government
keeping what it considers to be secrets and a free press,'' Frankel
told The Associated Press. ``This is one of those conflicts.''
   Fletcher said that in his view he broke no censorship law
``because we just continued to work the way we always work. We
waited for them to call us and they didn't so we assumed all was
OK. I assumed what I had was a government leak.''
   ``The whole area of Israeli censorship as it involves foreign
correspondents is a gray area,'' he said. ``I think this is all a
matter of crossed wires.''
   Fletcher, 40, has worked in Israel for the past five years after
stints for NBC in Paris and Africa. He has worked for NBC for 11
years.
   Frankel, 38, has worked in Israel for two years. He previously
was the paper's southern Africa bureau chief for three years and
also worked in Richmond, Va. He has worked for the Washington Post
for nine years.
   Benjamin C. Bradlee, executive editor of the Washington Post,
said the newspaper would protest Israel's move against Frankel.
   ``They are going to lose access to the Post's reporter, which
will hurt them as much as us,'' he said. ``At this particular time
to cut off a major newspaper seems to me to be self-defeating.''
   NBC spokeswoman Mary Lou O'Callaghan said NBC was writing a
letter of protest to the Israeli government.
   In 1980, Israel lifted the press credentials of Dan Raviv, a CBS
News reporter, who wrote that Israel had tested a nuclear bomb with
the aid of South Africa.
   Raviv, who at the time was based in Israel, flew to Rome to file
his report. The army denied the report.
   In 1969, Israel suspended the press credentials of Tony Hatch,
another CBS News reporter, who broadcast that an Israeli army
commando unit had crossed into Egypt on a secret mission.

   The blast that crippled the USS Bonefish may
have been caused by a battery explosion, and three missing members
of the submarine's crew may have died trying to save the lives of
their comrades, the Navy's top officer said today.
   The Bonefish remained tethered to a rescue ship as officials
waited for toxic gases to clear before starting salvage efforts
after the Sunday explosions and fire that injured 22 crewman.
   Atlantic Fleet headquarters confirmed today that the first
explosion occurred while the sub was at periscope depth. However,
the spokesman refused to comment on speculation that the ship was
recharging batteries at the time.
   In Washington, Adm. Carlisle A.H. Trost said a battery explosion
was a likely cause, and said the three missing men might have died
while saving the lives of their comrades.
   ``All three of those individuals ... were on watch in the ship's
control room and were last seen there,'' said Trost, who is chief
of naval operations and a submariner himself.
   ``So it may well be that they simply ensured that everyone got
clear and they themselves didn't make it.''
   Relatives of the missing sailors, meanwhile, maintained vigils.
   ``We still have a little ray of hope,'' said Joyce Lindgren,
mother of Petty Officer 3rd Class Marshall T. Lindgren of Pisgah
Forest, N.C. ``When he enrolled in the Navy I gave him to the Lord
and I have to have trust in him now.''
   The 30-year-old submarine, one of the Navy's last
diesel-electric subs, was participating in training exercises
Sunday in the Atlantic about 160 miles off the coast of Florida
when it was rocked by a series of explosions.
   At least one blast occurred in the battery compartment and fire
broke out in the forward battery compartment, said Lt. Cmdr. Aaron
Long, spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet headquarters in Norfolk.
   The crew brought the sub to the surface and its captain, Cmdr.
Mike Wilson, ordered it abandoned because of the dense smoke and
toxic fumes.
   Of the 92 officer and crew board, 89 were taken aboard the
frigate USS Carr and aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy, which were
involved in the exercises. The ships were unable to find the three
crewmen, and officials were uncertain whether they were aboard the
vessel or in the water.
   The Bonefish was afloat today alongside the submarine rescue
ship USS Petrel. Salvage workers were to board the sub once experts
decided it was safe, but Navy officials were unsure when that would
be, Long said.
   Long refused to say what types of toxic gases might be present
or what caused the explosions.
   The Virginian-Pilot of Norfolk reported today that the first
explosion occurred at periscope depth, leading to speculation that
the ship was recharging its batteries via a generator drawing air
through a snorkel raised with the periscope.
   Fleet spokesman Lt. Fred Henney confirmed this morning that the
first explosion did occur at periscope depth, less than about 70
feet below the surface, but would not comment further.
   Trost said ``battery explosion is the best information that we
have'' as to the cause.
   The salvage ship USS Hoist from the Little Creek Amphibious Base
in Norfolk was expected to join the Petrel at the scene today.
   On Monday, injured sailors were taken by helicopter from the
Kennedy to the Naval Hospital in Jacksonville, Fla. Twenty were
held for observation, and two were in serious but stable condition
in intensive care suffering from smoke inhalation.
   ``The majority of them are expected to be released today,'' said
Lt. Cmdr. John Crowell, hospital administrator.
   The only two that will definitely have to stay at least 48 hours
are Lt. Edmund Collins, 34, of Park Forest, Ill., and Petty Officer
1st Class Antone Silvia, of Fort Lauderdale, said Crowell.
   The injured crewmen will receive X-rays and pulmonary function
tests to see if they have recovered from the effects of smoke
inhalation, he said.
   Navy spokesman Nick Young said none of the sailors was expected
to talk with the media about their experience after being released
from the hospital.
   The rest of the crew was taken Monday to the Mayport Naval
Station in Florida, then flown back to Charleston, S.C., where the
submarine is based.
   Lee Causey and his wife, Alice, of Jacksonville went to Mayport
to meet their 30-year son, Petty Officer 1st Class Avery L. Causey.
   ``He didn't say much. He was just glad to be back,'' Causey
said. ``It's good to see him. I was on a submarine for 21 years, so
I know what he's going through.''
   The sailors, who refused to answer reporters' questions, looked
grim as they walked across the windy tarmac at the Charleston Air
Force Base to meet relatives. One had a bandage on his head.
   About 30 people, many holding balloons, greeted the plane. One
woman held up a single yellow rose. Another held a balloon and wore
a jacket reading ``Diesel Boats Forever'' beneath a cartoon of a
submarine.
   The 219-foot Bonefish, commissioned in 1958, is powered on the
surface by diesel engines, but when submerged it uses electric
motors powered by two battery compartments. The batteries are
recharged by a generator when the ship is surfaced.
   Each battery is equipped with an exhaust system to remove
battery gases and hydrogen created during recharging.
   The Virginian-Pilot quoted retired Adm. Harry D. Train II, who
commanded the Bonefish's sister ship the Barbel in the early 1960s,
as saying that hydrogen builds up during recharging and can be
hazardous if not vented.
   The Bonefish is among the last of the Navy's diesel-electric
submarines, which are used primarily to mimic Soviet submarines in
training exercises. The Soviets still operate about 100 such subs.
   Besides Lindgren, the missing were identified as Lt. Ray Everts
of Naoma, W.Va., and Petty Officer 1st Class Robert W. Bordelon Jr.
of Willis, Texas.

   The Reagan administration told the Supreme
Court today that the law establishing independent counsels
unconstitutionally ``strips the president of a purely executive
power'' and improperly relieves Congress of its duty to scrutinize
federal officials.
   The power to prosecute high-ranking federal officials ``cannot
be turned over to a serene process ... to platonic guardians''
outside the political fray, said Solicitor General Charles Fried,
the administration's top courtroom lawyer.
   The justices heard 90 minutes of arguments in a crucial battle
over the federal law that lets independent counsels investigate
alleged crimes by high-ranking federal officials. Their decision is
expected to be announced by July.
   Among those defending the law today were Michael Davidson,
representing Senate leaders.
   Davidson, questioned vigorously by several justices, said the
post-Watergate law does not tip the balance of power the
Constitution apportioned among the executive, legislative and
judicial branches.
   He said the law permits the attorneyunsel must
stay within the constitutionally required parameters of his
office.''
   Davidson was responding to a question by Justice Antonin Scalia,
who raised concern Congress might trigger a probe of an official
simply because members of a committee did not like the official's
response to their questions.
   ``I am concerned about the reality of affecting the balance of
power'' between the branches, Scalia said. A congressional
committee could call for an independent counsel investigation
``anytime testimony (by an official) is displeasing,'' he said.
   Fried said a problem of the law is that it excuses Congress from
exercising its proper scrutiny over the president.
   He cited the Watergate scandal as the prime example of the
political system working properly. Public opinion and the threat of
impeachment _ rather than an independent prosecutor _ guaranteed
that the Nixon administration was investigated thoroughly, Fried
said.
   ``Everyone knows those (Watergate) prosecutors proceeded to a
denouement without missing a beat,'' he said.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who joined the court in February,
has disqualified himself from taking part in the case without
explanation. His absence creates the possibility of a 4-4 tie.
   A deadlock would have the effect of upholding a ruling by the
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here that struck down the special
prosecutor law.
   The appeals court ruled that the Watergate-era law creating
independent counsels impermissibly gives presidential appointment
powers to the federal courts.
   The 2-1 appeals court ruling also said the independent counsel
provisions of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 were an
unconstitutional encroachment of the exclusive power of the
president to enforce criminal laws.
   Under the law, a special court appoints independent counsels or
special prosecutors at the request of the attorney general to
investigate alleged criminal wrongdoing.
   The law was challenged in the investigation of former Justice
Department official Theodore B. Olson.
   Alexia Morrison is investigating allegations that Olson lied to
Congress in 1983 during a dispute over the Environmental Protection
Agency's cleanup program for toxic waste.
   Also at stake could be the January conviction of former
presidential aide Michael K. Deaver for lying to a grand jury and
to a House subcommittee that investigated his lobbying activities.
   The eventual Supreme Court decision also might affect the
indictments of former Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North and three others
accused of crimes in the Iran-Contra affair.
   However, independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh is acting in the
Iran-Contra case with separate, backup power from Attorney General
Edwin Meese III, and that authority has been upheld by the courts.
   Nonetheless, North and his co-defendants say Walsh's probe still
is subject to constitutional challenge because his investigation
began before the backup authority was conferred.

<HEAD>Judge Alters Primary Balloting System</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson has won a court victory
in New Jersey that will allow primary voters to pull one lever to
choose both a presidential candidate and the delegates assigned to
him.
   Hudson County Superior Court Judge Burrell Ives Humphreys
decided Monday on a compromise to address a request by Jackson's
Democratic presidential campaign, which had challenged the
balloting system that required voters to vote for a candidate and
again for the candidate's delegate slate.
   The Jackson campaign said it would be easier for voters to pull
just one lever, rather than two, to choose a candidate and
delegates.
   But the Democratic Party, the campaign of Gov. Michael Dukakis
of Massachusetts and New Jersey's county clerks opposed the plan,
saying it was contrary to party rules, would limit a voter's
choices and would be expensive.
   On Monday, Humphreys decided to permit voters who wish to do so
to pull one lever to select their candidate and his delegates.
   In areas with machines that can accommodate both single- and
multi-lever voting, Humphreys said voters would be given a choice.
In areas without such equipment, write-in ballots would be
available to those voters wishing to make separate selections for a
candidate and delegates.
   ``We should not lose sight of the purpose of the ballot, which
is to allow voters to ma gross
national product was propelled by a strong increase in consumer
spending and the biggest surge in business investment in more than
four years.
   Economists said the balanced growth was good news for
Republicans in an election year and should bury lingering fears
that the 508-point drop in the stock market on Oct. 19 would topple
the country into a recession.
   ``This report presents a good, healthy picture of the U.S.
economy in the first quarter, nothing near a recession despite all
the earlier worries,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the
Boston Co. ``This is good political reading for the Republicans.''
   The administration wasted no time in boasting about the GNP
report.
   ``So much for the recession that was supposed to occur in the
first quarter,'' Commerce Under Secretary Robert Ortner said at a
briefing for reporters. ``Today's report shows the economy entering
its sixth year of expansion with inflation remaining moderate.''
   In further good news, the growth was accompanied by a slowdown
in the rate of inflation, with a price measure tied to the GNP
rising at an annual rate of 2.4 percent, down from a 2.7 percent
increase in the fourth quarter.
   Beryl Sprinkel, the president's chief economic adviser, said
that the GNP report should allay fears that have cropped up
recently in financial markets that growing inflationary pressures
would force the Federal Reserve Board to raise interest rates in
coming months.
   ``The economy is on track for moderate further expansion and
restrained inflation in 1988,'' Sprinkel said at a White House
briefing.
   The GNP grew at a much faster 4.8 percent rate in the
October-December quarter, but analysts said that growth masked some
dangerous imbalances that were not present in the first quarter
report.
   Almost all of the fourth quarter increase in GNP wound up as
unsold inventory sitting on shelves. At the same time, consumer
spending was taking a rare nose dive, falling by 2.5 percent, the
biggest drop in seven years. This combination has in the past been
a harbinger of a recession.
   This pattern was reversed in the first quarter with business
inventories, which had risen by $39.4 billion in the fourth
quarter, falling by $13.2 billion in the first quarter, indicating
a success by businesses in reducing swollen inventories.
   Much of the success in working down the inventory bulge occurred
in auto showrooms, as dealers were aided by a new round of sales
incentives.
   This helped boost consumer spending by $23.6 billion in the
first quarter, a 3.8 percent annual rate of increase. The report
said more than half of that growth came in auto sales.
   Business investment for capital equipment shot up at an annual
rate of 32.5 percent in the first quarter, the fastest advance
since a 39.5 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 1983.
   In other good news, the country's trade deficit, after removing
the effects of inflation, narrowed by $3.6 billion in the first
quarter, continuing the trend of improvement that began in mid-1986.
   The administration, which is forecasting that GNP will grow 2.9
percent for the full year, is counting on further improvements in
the trade deficit to supply almost half of GNP growth this year.
   Much of the rest of the increase is expected to come from higher
business capital spending as companies expand production facilities
to meet a growing export demand.
   Both of those trends were evident in today's GNP report,
providing good news for the Reagan administration, which is
counting on a sixth straight year of economic growth to boost
chances for a Republican presidential win in November.
   In another report, the government said that after-tax corporate
profits rose an even faster 2.6 percent in the final three months
of 1987. This was an upward revision from a month ago, when the
government put the increase in business profits at 1.6 percent.
   Two factors that held back GNP growth in the first quarter were
a 9.4 percent drop in residential construction spending and a 22.3
percent drop in spending by the federal government, reflecting in
large part a swing in farm subsidy payments.
   The various changes pushed the GNP, after adjusting for
inflation, up by $21.8 billion, to a new annual rate of $3.90
trillion.
   The first quarter growth was welcome news when compared to
forecasts being made at the beginning of the year. At the time,
some analysts were actually predicting that the GNP would decline
in the first quarter, signalling the start of a new recession.
   The pessimists believed that a combination of the shock to
consumer confidence from the stock market collapse and the huge
overhang of business inventories would severely depress economic
activity in the early part of this year.
   The fear was that after a loss of a trillion dollars in wealth,
nervous consumers would stop spending and manufacturers, caught
with huge inventories of unsold goods, would cut back on production
and lay off workers.
   But, those events did not occur. Instead of cutting back after
the market turmoil, employers actually boosted hiring. Since
October, an average of 362,000 new jobs have been added to the
economy each month, more than twice the size of the monthly gains
before the crash.
   The big gains in employment helped restore consumer confidence,
considered critical for the economy's health since consumer
spending accounts for two-thirds of economic activity.
   The Reagan administration is predicting that the GNP will expand
at a 2.9 percent annual rate this year, marking the third
consecutive year the economy has grown at this rate.
   This view is in line with the outlook of many private
forecasters as well. Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a Sedona, Ariz.
newsletter, said that its latest survey of 51 top economists found
a consensus forecast for growth of 2.7 percent this year, up
significantly from a 1.9 percent GNP estimate made in the month
following the market crash.

   Two seriously injured sailors
from the USS Bonefish will remain hospitalized for at least two
days, but most of the other sailors hurt after an explosion on the
submarine will be released shortly, officials said today.
   Nick Young, a Navy spokesman, said Tuesday that 19 of the 22
hospitalized sailors would probably be released today from a
hospital at the Jacksonville Naval Air Station and flown to their
homeport in Charleston.
   Sixty-seven uninjured fellow officers and crewmen solemnly
returned home Monday while the Navy continued its search for three
sailors missing since Sunday afternoon's accident in the Atlantic
160 miles east of Florida.
   The injured were taken from the disabled sub aboard the aircraft
carrier USS John F. Kennedy.
   The only two that will definitely have to stay at least 48 hours
are Lt. Edmund Collins, 34, of Park Forest, Ill., and Petty Officer
1st Class Antone Silvia, of Fort Lauderdale, said Lt. Cmdr. John
Crowell, the hospital's administrator. They were listed in serious
condition.
   The injured crewmen will receive X-rays and pulmonary function
tests to see if they have recovered from the effects of smoke
inhalation, he said.
   Most of the injured crewmen suffered smoke inhalation, Young
said. The submarine had a crew of 92 men.
   Young said none of the sailors here was expected to talk to the
media about their experience after being released from the hospital.
   The uninjured sailors, many wearing blue coveralls and some of
them shoeless, also refused to answer reporters' questions here or
after they returned to their home base in Charleston, S.C.
   A few carried small plastic bags, apparently holding personal
belongings.
   Sailors arriving at the Charleston Air Force Base looked grim as
they walked across the windy tarmac to meet relatives. One sailor's
head was bandaged.
   About 30 people, many holding balloons, greeted the plane there.
   One woman held a single yellow rose aloft. Another held a
balloon with the legend ``P.S. I Love You'' and wore a jacket
reading ``Diesel Boats Forever'' beneath a cartoon of a submarine.
The Bonefish is one of the Navy's last diesel-electric subs.
   While the crew waited on a bus for the ride to their own base,
sailors sitting at the windows were asked if they were all right.
   ``Yes,'' one unidentified sailor said. ``Thank God for that.''
   Lee and Alice Causey of Jacksonville drove to Mayport to greet
their son, Petty Officer 1st Class Avery L. Causey, 30.
   ``He didn't say much. He was just glad to be back,'' Causey
said. ``It's good to see him. I was on a submarine for 21 years, so
I know what he's going through.''
   Chaplain Bill Perry went aboard the other rescue ship, the
frigate USS Carr, at Mayport and visited the Bonefish crewmen.
   The general mood was ``overwhelming fatigue,'' he said, adding
that most had been up all night and many had been on watch the
night before. Most spent the night in the Carr's mess hall, talking
about the experience.
   ``They've been through a real trauma,'' Perry said.

   Presidential candidate Jesse Jackson told top
State Department officials today that South Africa should be
treated as a terrorist nation because it backs Mozambique rebels
who have allegedly killed 100,000 civilians.
   The Democrat was briefed at the State Department on a recent
study describing ``systematic abuse'' and murder by the Renamo
rebels. He told reporters that the sponsorship of the rebels by
South Africa ``defines state-sponsored terrorism.''
   Chester Crocker, assistant secretary of state for African
affairs, joining Jackson at a news conference outside the State
Department, acknowledged South Africa's ties to the rebels. But he
declined to characterize South Africa as a terrorist state, saying
only that its involvement with Renamo goes against a previous
commitment made by Pretoria.
   Both Crocker and Jackson described the session this morning,
which included Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead, as a
briefing session for the candidate.
   The study was conducted by State Department consultant Robert
Gersony and released a week ago. Jackson siezed on it to underscore
his call for a change in U.S. policy toward South Africa and the
so-called frontline states around it.
   The report was based on Gersony's interviews with 196 Mozambique
refugees and numerous relief workers who told of random murders,
rapes, burning of villages, forced labor, mutilation, looting and
beatings by Renamo, which is trying to bring down Mozambique's
Marxist-led government.
   ``It is conservatively estimated that 100,000 civilians may have
been murdered by Renamo in this manner,'' the report concluded.
   Jackson challenged his Democratic opponent, Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis, and Vice President George Bush to also
characterize South Africa as a terrorist state.
   He also called for an increase in humanitarian aid to the
frontline states and for a congressional delegation to visit
Mozambique and report to President Reagan on conditions there.
   Jackson has sought to make South Africa and African affairs part
of the presidential campaign debate, but other candidates have not
made it an issue.
   Earlier today, Jackson met at Capitol Hill with Congress members
and ambassadors of the frontline states on the issue.
   Some conservative members of Congress have called for U.S. aid
to Renamo, but the United States officially supports the Mozambican
government.

   Riot police battled protesters today
during violent demonstrations against alleged vote fraud as
opposition candidates took a surprise lead in about half of the
Parliamentary races nationwide.
   With 30 percent of the vote counted, the state-controlled KBS
television network reported that candidates from three opposition
parties were leading in 117 races.
   Candidates in President Roh Tae-woo's Democratic Justice Party
led in only 90. There were no immediate trends reported in the
other 17 races for the 224 single-member districts.
   Another 75 seats in the 299-member assembly will be decided by
the parties' nationwide vote proportions.
   The Korean news agency Yonhap predicted that Roh's party would
fail to win a majority. Earlier predictions said the governing
party would triumph because of divisions within the opposition.
   Opposition control of the legislature would have added impact
under a new constitution that took effect in February, when Roh
started a five-year term after winning office in December with 36
percent of the vote.
   The new basic law, part of democratic reforms begun last summer
after widespread anti-government demonstrations, gives the assembly
powers to investigate government actions. The president no longer
can dissolve the legislature, which has a four-year term.
   Today's protests followed a report Monday by one television
station that Democratic Justice Party candidate Hyun Kyung-dae had
won a seat on southern Cheju Island with 39 percent of the vote.
The station, part of the MBC network, said the report accidentally
went on the air during a rehearsal for today's election coverage.
   The network said it fired the station manager and four other
officials.
   But the gaffe fueled protests on the island, where an estimated
1,000 people fought with police. News reports said authorities were
investigating whether the broadcast broke election laws.
   In other developments, an opposition campaigner died after
drenching himself in gasoline and igniting it during an argument
with government supporters in the southern city of Woekwan, Korean
press reports said. The man was identified as Lee Kwang-ho, 21, a
member of the Reunification Democratic Party.
   Korean newspapers also said two opposition campaigners were in
critical condition after being stabbed by unknown assailants in
Hwasoon, another southern city.
   In Seoul, police fired tear gas to disperse 300 Yonsei
University students who threw rocks and firebombs to protest
alleged election manipulation in favor of the governing party.
   Earlier, police broke up a similar protest by 50 Yonsei
students. No injuries were reported.
   Hundreds of students dashed through streets in Seoul's downtown
Myongdong shopping area, shouting slogans against ``election
rigging'' and chanting ``Down with dictatorship.''
   Police pursued them, sometimes hurling tear gas grenades.
Citizens rescued a student being dragged away by riot police.
   Yonhap said police arrested more 120 students around Kwangju in
southwestern South Korea.
   In the southern city of Chonju, about 500 opposition supporters
battled riot police. In Mockpo, another southern city, hundreds of
protesters occupied downtown streets.
   Voting began at 7 a.m. and the polls closed at 6 p.m. (5 a.m.
EDT).
   Officials estimated 72.6 percent of the 26.2 million registered
voters turned out, down from 84.6 percent in the 1985 legislative
elections and 89.2 percent in the December presidential election.
   Opposition leader Kim Young-sam of the Reunification Democratic
Party, who ran for an assembly seat in the southern city of Pusan,
accused the government of staging ``unjust elections unprecedented
in our history.''
   On Monday, the governing party expelled one candidate after
4,296 envelopes, each containing about $30 and leaflets for
Democratic Justice candidate Kwon Joong-dong, were found by
opposition members at a post office in Andong, south of Seoul.
   At an Andong cathedral, riot police fired tear gas at 40 Roman
Catholic farmers who demanded the candidate's arrest, Yonhop said.
   Police reported 90 cases of election-related violence nationwide
in the campaign, with more than 150 people detained and 77 of them
formally charged.
   Observers said before the election that the opposition was too
weak to win. Support for the opposition eroded after its leaders,
Kim Dae-jung of the Party for Peace and Democracy and Kim
Young-sam, ran in the December presidential election.
   They split the opposition vote and allowed Roh to win the first
direct presidential election in 16 years.
   The governing party, campaigning on pledges of stability for
economic and democratic progress, had hoped to win about 125 of the
224 seats being decided in single-member districts, along with 38
of the 75 seats to be decided by the parties' nationwide vote
proportions.

   The leader of an American expedition in
the Himalayas said Tuesday his missing colleague had fallen or
frozen to death after reaching the top of 23,488-foot Mount Pumori.
   Chris Leibindgut, 27, of Wasilla, Alaska, has been missing since
April 18, the day he and expedition leader John Tuckey reached the
top of the mountain.
   ``Either Chris fell to death or froze or both,'' said Tuckey, of
Girdwood, Alaska. ``We could not find his body. So we presume ...
he has got to be dead right now.''
   According to Tuckey, Leibindgut disappeared at 6:40 p.m., two
hours after the two had reached the summit, at a place about 148
feet below the highest point.
   ``At the summit, Chris complained of dizziness and was acting
confused,'' he said. ``So we descended a short way below the
summit.''
   ``It became dark ... (and) very windy,'' he continued. ``So, I
started to dig a snow cave for us in preparation for spending the
night there. While I was digging, Chris wandered off and walked
away. I have not seen him since then.''
   Tuckey, 37, said he spent the night alone in the snow cave and
the next day descended the east ridge of the mountain.
   On April 11, the two had started climbing the southern ridge of
the peak, accompanied by Doug White, 27, of Walnut Creek, Calif.,
and Randy Kopal, 38, of Eldorado Springs, Colo. The group left
their base camp at the 17,318-foot level without the help of Sherpa
guides, setting up their first camp the same day and a second camp
the following day. White and Kopal then returned to base camp.
   ``They were moving slowly,'' Tuckey said. ``We thought we would
have a better chance of success if we moved faster. So, Chris and I
continued. We went in Alpine style _ no fixed ropes even. That is
why we had to go fast.''
   During the climb, Tuckey and Leigindgut spent some nights in
snow caves and one night in the open without shelter.
   Tuckey said the toes on his right foot became frostbitten during
the climb but he believed they would be OK.

<TEXT>
   A black Labrador retriever whose hind
legs are paralyzed won a bicycle as the top fund-raiser in a March
of Dimes walk-a-thon.
   The dog, named Remy, raised $108 in pledges by completing an
eight-mile route as part of the local March of Dimes chapter's Walk
America fund-raising effort. A specially built cart holds the dog's
crippled hind legs so that he can propel himself with his front
legs.
   ``It's amazing how fast he is,'' said Julianne Lee, a veterinary
technician at the Prairie Veterinary Hospital in Jamestown.
   Remy was an inspiration for the 34 participants in Sunday's
walk, some of whom were in wheelchairs, said Yvonne Hanzal, a state
human services worker.
   The hospital has cared for Remy since a hunter accidentally shot
him in the spine nearly a year ago.
   ``He got his cart last summer, and he learned quickly how to use
it,'' Ms. Lee said. ``He doesn't scratch the woodwork anymore, and
pulls himself up when he comes to a sidewalk or door sill. If he
gets stuck in a corner or a deep pile of snow, he just backs
himself out.''
   Officials are still discussing what to do with the 10-speed
bicycle that was offered as a prize for the top fund-raiser, Ms.
Lee said. It may be traded for another model that would be better
suited for a handicapped person, or auctioned to raise money for
the March of Dimes, she said.
   While Remy won't get the bike, the dog thoroughly enjoyed the
walk, Ms. Lee said.
   ``He has an extremely pleasant personality,'' she said. ``This
was a big day for him. He really enjoys being around people.''

   A water pipe burst during
construction on the site of Disney World's new Typhoon Lagoon,
killing one worker and injuring three others.
   Disney officials and sheriff's spokesman Randy Means said the
22-inch pipe burst during a pressure test Monday.
   The victims were installing underground pipes at the water
attraction, which will feature pools for swimming and surfing and a
man-made river.
   Frank Irey Jr., president of the Frank Irey Construction Co.,
said the workers were in a trench, getting ready to pour concrete
around the pipe, when a joint broke, knocking the pipe into the men.
   Lawrence Hefner, 59, of Donora, Pa., died shortly after being
rushed to Orlando Regional Medical Center. The other three workers
were reported in stable condition at the same hospital.

   Essex Video, once one of the nation's biggest
makers of hard-core adult films, has filed for bankruptcy while its
president faces federal charges.
   Essex, based in the suburban San Fernando Valley, claimed in an
April 5 bankruptcy filing that it has no assets and more than 100
creditors, including film director John Derek, husband of actress
Bo Derek. Essex owes Derek $6,500 in royalties from a film titled
``Love You'' that he made in the mid 1970s.
   What happened to Essex's films and licenses is a mystery.
   Former Essex salesman Eugene Marino has started a new adult
video company called Essex West, which took over Essex's
headquarters and has thousands of videocassettes in its warehouse.
   But Marino insists Essex West has no connection to Essex.
   ``I have a silent partner,'' he said, refusing to identify that
person.
   Essex, along with Caballero Home Video and Video Company of
America, also both based in the San Fernando Valley, were at one
time considered the Big Three in the pornographic film industry,
said Sgt. Don Smith of the police department's vice unit.
   The adult film industry generated $750 million in sales in the
Los Angeles area alone last year, Smith said.
   But Essex, which reportedly had annual sales of $40 million just
a few years ago, was driven into financial trouble by high
production costs, said Jared Rutter, editor of the trade
publication Film World Reports.
   ``Essex put too much money into production,'' said Rutter,
adding that it also had its share of flop movies.
   The company's president, Jeff Steinman, is to appear Thursday in
federal court in Memphis, Tenn., on 16 counts of shipping obscene
materials through United Parcel Service.
   The Justice Department alleges that since 1982 Steinman was
shipping what the agency described as obscene videos across state
lines, a federal offense.
   Steinman, 30, was quoted in Tuesday's editions of the Los
Angeles Times as saying he would plead guilty to the charges.
However, he denied that Essex produced pornographic films, a
violation of California's pandering laws if the movies are made in
the state.
   Essex was founded in Hollywood in the late 1960s by Colombian
immigrant Joe Steinman, who bought the rights to adult films and
sold copies to theaters nationwide. He retired in 1979, turning
over the business to his son Jeff.
   The company quickly expanded into the home video market in the
late 1970s when videocasette recorders became popular, transferring
its huge film library to tape.
   But intense competition drove the price of videos down, Marino
said.
   ``Today there are tapes selling for $5 that were selling for $42
two years ago,'' he said.

   Authorities are investigating
allegations that a newspaper editor decked Mendocino County's top
school official with a single punch during a meeting of the school
board.
   Bruce Anderson, editor and publisher of the Anderson Valley
Advertiser, left Monday night's meeting 20 minutes before sheriff's
deputies arrived to take a complaint from School Superintendent Jim
Spence.
   Anderson, reached later by the Santa Rosa Press Democrat,
conceded he punched Spence and said he ``felt very stupid and very
embarrassed.''
   Witnesses told the newspaper the blow came after Spence called
Anderson ``a third-rate McCarthyite.''
   Spence, 46, signed an assault and battery complaint and the case
will be submitted to the district attorney, said Sheriff's Lt.
Larry Gander.
   Anderson, 48, was recently in the news over a hoax interview he
printed in his 2,500-circulation weekly, published in Boonville.
   The fake interview published earlier this year quoted Rep.
Douglas Bosco as calling his constituents ``a bunch of easily
stirred-up know-nothing malcontents who couldn't care less about
anything other than their beautiful ocean and where their next
joint is coming from.''

<HEAD>European Papers Comment on Demjanjuk Death Sentence</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Demjanjuk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two of Britain's leading newspapers on Tuesday
appealed to Israel to spare the life of John Demjanjuk, sentenced
to hang for war crimes committed as concentration camp guard ``Ivan
the Terrible.''
   But two Swiss papers took the opposite line, saying the sentence
was justified given the thousands of Jewish deaths ascribed to
Demjanjuk.
   Some European papers highlighted the cheers and singing that
broke out in the public gallery when the judges announced the
sentence.
   ``Singing and insults greet Demjanjuk death sentence,''
headlined the Independent in London. Its competitor, The Times,
said: ``Cheers and dancing at end of `Ivan' trial.''
   The conservative Times editorialized that the death penalty
``arouses misgivings,'' but said that since ``the sentence appeared
to be little more than a formality, it is to the credit of the
judges that they deliberated for three hours before pronouncing
sentence.''
   It added: ``If the Israeli authorities could see their way to
commuting the death sentence, this would further mark the emergence
of Israel as the civilized state it aspires to be. There could be
few more appropriate ways in which Israel could mark the 40th
anniversary of its foundation.''
   The conservative Daily Telegraph commented that in Israel ``the
trials of war criminals assist an explicitly political and
propagandist purpose: to remind the world until the end of time of
the nature of the Holocaust, and what was done to the Jewish
people.''
   It added: ``Yet even for Israel, in this 40th year of its
existence, there must come a moment when it is time to look
forward; not to forget the Holocaust, but to cauterize its terrible
wounds.''
   The Telegraph said: ``If Israel is convinced of his guilt then
let him rot in his cell.'' But it claimed the evidence against
Demjanjuk was flawed, and executing him ``could conceivably do as
much harm to the Jewish nation today as `Ivan the Terrible' did to
individual Jews.''
   In Switzerland, the independent Basler Zeitung commented:
``Given the atrocities he has been convicted of, the sentence is of
secondary importance. No punishment can render justice in his
case.''
   The conservative Neue Zurcher Zeitung agreed, saying: ``One
could argue that it would be wiser to sentence a person, whose
identity is only 99 percent sure, to life imprisonment instead of
to death. But there is no third between guilt and innocence ... and
the crimes committed ... justify the sentence imposed according to
Israeli law.''
   Alfred Emmerlich, a legal expert with West Germany's opposition
Social Democratic Party, told the General Anzeiger newspaper in
Bonn that his party condemns the death penalty in general,
including in Israel.
   ``There is always the possibility of a mistake, and there is no
way to correct such a mistake when the death penalty has been
carried out.''
   In the Netherlands, Rabbi Avraham Soetendorp said he welcomed
the death sentence as a symbol but did not want it carried out.
   ``I face a certain conflict of conscience because I am opposed
to capital punishment,'' he told The Associated Press.
   Soetendorp, a prominent Dutch lobbyist for Jewish causes, said
Demjanjuk should be jailed for life.
   ``It's a good thing the trial's finally over ... and that it's
become clear that he (Demjanjuk) really is Ivan the Terrible,'' he
said.
   Reporting from Jerusalem for Le Figaro of Paris, Rene Bauduc
wrote that if Demjanjuk lost his appeal to the Israeli Supreme
Court, he would hang, ``carrying away with him the memory of the
horrors of an epoch, but also the doubts of all those who, looking
at this man of peaceful appearance, have difficulty believing he
could have committed such crimes.''

   Michael Dukakis swept to an easy victory
over Jesse Jackson in the Utah presidential caucuses, preparing for
today's delegate-rich Pennsylvania primary by collecting a large
majority of Utah's 23 Democratic delegates.
   Unofficial results with 94 percent of the vote counted in Monday
night's caucuses showed Dukakis with 7,550 votes, or 71 percent,
compared with 1,682, or 16 percent, for Jackson. Some 1,231 voters,
or 11 percent, were uncommitted.
   Those percentages would leave Dukakis with 19 Utah delegates to
the Democratic National Convention and Jackson with four.
   ``We're really happy,'' said Dukakis state campaign coordinator
Gary Knoblock. ``It's a long way from home to be winning by this
kind of margin. We've been slowly climbing in the West, but this
took a quantum leap.''
   Complete statewide returns were not expected until late today.
   Campaign aides touted the victory as another sign that Dukakis
had momentum going into today's Pennsylvania primary, where 178
delegates are at stake and the Massachusetts governor has been
heavily favored in polls.
   Jackson supporters, meanwhile, said they were pleased to have
come away with any delegates from a state where 93 percent of the
population is white and less than 1 percent is black. A candidate
must get at least 15 percent of the vote to qualify for a share of
the delegates.
   ``The votes that came in for Jackson were certainly not
all-inclusive minority votes. I feel very good about what we've
done,'' said Jackson state chairman Marvin Davis.
   In 1984, Jackson won only 4 percent of the vote here.
   Counting the three ``super delegates'' who have endorsed him,
Dukakis' total Utah count would be 22 delegates. National
Committeewoman Norma Matheson, Rep. Wayne Owens and state party
Chairman Randy Horiuchi have endorsed Dukakis, while National
Committeeman and former Gov. Calvin Rampton and Elizabeth Willey
remain uncommitted.
   Dukakis also had the endorsement in the caucuses of former
Democratic Gov. Scott Matheson.
   Of the 23 delegates apportioned in Monday night's binding
balloting, 20 will be elected at the state convention in June, and
three will be elected separately by the state party's central
committee.
   In addition to the presidential poll, those attending the
caucuses elected delegates to county conventions next month and
voted for precinct captains.
   Republicans had planned a non-binding presidential preference
vote, but abandoned the idea after Vice President George Bush
virtually locked up the GOP nomination. Instead, Republicans voted
on their preference for vice president and whether they favor
holding a western regional primary in 1992 similar to the South's
``Super Tuesday'' this year.
   Results of the Republican balloting will not be available for
several days.
   Horiuchi said the turnout, estimated at more than 10,000, was
considerably better than 1984, when only 6,000 to 7,000 attended
what were then called mass meetings.

   The bullet-riddled bodies of five
young men were found Tuesday in the trunk of a car parked at a
suburban San Juan housing project, police said.
   Each victim's hands and feet were tied and each had been shot
repeatedly, police said.
   The men apparently were slain elsewhere, put into car's trunk
and driven to the Sabana Bajo housing project in the suburb of
Carolina, police spokesman Tony Santiago said.
   The bodies were taken to the Forensic Sciences Institute at the
Medical Center in Rio Piedras for examination. Institute director
Pio Rechani said all were between the age of 18 and 23.
   One of the victims was identified as Luis Alberto Diaz Orta, 20,
of the Ramon T. Colon Housing Project in Carolina. The identities
of the others were not known.

<HEAD>Dukakis Leads in Ohio and Indiana; Jackson Counts on District of
Columbia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DALE LEACH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Democratic presidential candidates
have left behind Pennsylvania but the big industry problems that
plague that state follow the campaign into the next round of
primaries in Ohio and Indiana.
   Front-runner Michael Dukakis held solid leads over Jesse Jackson
in polls of voter sentiment leading up to next Tuesday's primaries
in those Midwestern states.
   However, the Jackson forces were hoping their candidate would be
helped in Ohio by the efforts of Gerald Austin, his campaign
manager who helped steer the successful campaigns of Gov. Richard
Celeste in 1982 and 1986.
   The District of Columbia also holds its primary next Tuesday,
and Mayor Marion Barry Jr. predicts Jackson could win as much as 70
percent of the Democratic vote in the city that gave Jackson one of
his few 1984 victories.
   In Ohio, Dukakis and Jackson were expected to keep hitting hard
at such issues as plant closings and a need for government to help
create new jobs. Jackson's first appearance in the state was at a
steel plant.
   Dukakis, already well ahead of Jackson in the delegate count,
could add to the increasing sense of inevitability about his
nomination if he could win the lion's share of the 159 Democratic
delegates at stake in Ohio and the 79 in Indiana.
   But Jackson was beginning a full week of campaigning in Ohio on
Tuesday, and Dukakis' aides were speaking as if they were taking
nothing for granted.
   ``We've got a tough job cut out for us in Ohio,'' said Anne
Drake, director of Dukakis' Ohio campaign. ``I don't think there is
any way to possibly downplay the effect that Jerry Austin will have
on Ohio's primary.''
   Linda Brown, a Jackson spokeswoman, agreed, saying, ``It's
certainly an asset for us because of Jerry's visibility here in the
Ohio area and his track record with past Ohio campaigns.''
   Still, state Rep. C.J. McLin of Dayton, Jackson's Ohio campaign
chairman, said, ``I'm not fooling myself. It's going to be
difficult. But I still think we have a chance.''
   A Gallup Poll conducted April 8-10 showed Dukakis leading
Jackson in Ohio, 50 percent to 23 percent.
   Dukakis also holds a comfortable lead in most recent polls in
Indiana. An Indianapolis Star survey taken April 17-19 showed him
favored by 49 percent to 21 percent for Jackson.
   Ohio Democratic leaders have generally taken no stands on the
race _ unlike four years ago when most endorsed Walter Mondale,
only to see Gary Hart win a narrow victory in the primary.
   Dukakis' name will appear on ballots throughout Ohio. But
Jackson failed to qualify delegate slates in three of the state's
21 congressional districts: two largely rural districts with few
black voters and a district west of Cleveland.
   Although Democrats hold both U.S. Senate seats and virtually
every statewide office in Ohio, the state has been friendly
territory for Ronald Reagan. In 1984, Reagan won the state with 59
percent of the vote.
   Herbert B. Asher, an Ohio State University political science
professor, said, ``I think two major things the candidates need to
keep in mind are that the state really has eight major media
markets. It is a difficult state to campaign in because there is no
single dominant area.
   ``I think the other thing that really is new to the Democrats is
that it finally is down to a two-person contest. ... That means,
then, that Dukakis and Jackson are campaigning against each other.''
   In the Republican primary, 88 delegates are up for grabs in Ohio
and 30 in Indiana, most of them expected to move into Vice
President George Bush's column as he smoothly sails toward the GOP
convention.
   In the District of Columbia, 11 delegates will be directly
chosen in the Democratic primary, a contest that Jackson has
virtually nailed down in the heavily black city.

<TEXT>
   A spill at a Shell Oil Co. refinery has
left dozens of birds and marsh animals coated with crude oil during
nesting season in the wildlife haven of the Suisun Bay marshland.
   By Monday, about 100 oiled birds _ including egrets, avocets,
cinnamon teals, mallard ducks, grebes, herons and endangered
clapper rail birds _ had been rescued and taken to centers in
Berkeley and Walnut Creek for cleaning, said Brian Hunter, of the
state Department of Fish and Game.
   In another California oil industry development, a federal judge
has decided that local ordinances did not violate federal
regulations in a ruling that threw out 10 of 13 oil industry claims
against cities and counties attempting to control offshore drilling.
   The birds were trapped after 21,000 gallons of thick, unrefined
crude gushed Saturday from Martinez' Shell Refinery holding tank,
30 miles northeast of San Francisco.
   The oil coats the birds' feathers, leaving them unable to keep
warm or move around.
   Also threatened are the endangered salt marsh harvest mouse and
such marsh creatures as tortoises, muskrats and otters. Volunteers
have reported a dozen dead muskrats, several oil-coated turtles and
a dead heron.
   State officials said Monday they planned to sacrifice a section
of Suisun Bay marshland in order to save hundreds more acres of
wetlands.
   ``We're trying to keep new areas from becoming oiled,'' said
Hunter.
   By Monday, a slick stretched 10 miles from Port Costa east to
Ryer Island.
   Six vessels with oil skimmers and 16 vacuum tank-trucks were
sent to capture oil but Coast Guard spokesman Ken Massey estimated
it could take until next week to clean up the oil.
   Shell said it traced the spill to a damaged drain on a tank on
the west side of Interstate 680.
   Massey said Shell will have to pay for the damage, including new
paint for the bottoms of hundreds of pleasure boats.
   In the offshore drilling case, U.S. District Judge Consuelo B.
Marshall ruled in Los Angeles that in 10 cases the local ordinances
did not challenge federal supremacy as the oil industry had claimed.
   The judge, in a decision made public Monday, said further
examination of the evidence was necessary to determine if
ordinances in three areas might violate the commerce clause of the
Constitution.
   The Western Oil and Gas Association and National Ocean
Industries Association filed suit last August.
   Western Oil contended in the suit that the local ordinances
would ``create a wall from the Mexican border to the Oregon state
line blocking development of oil in the outer continental shelf.''
Development would be hindered by severe restrictions on onshore
support facilities such as pipelines and processing plants,
according to the suit.
   But the judge ruled the ordinances are not true obstacles to
commerce.
   ``By implication, the judge has recognized the local governments
have good reason to be concerned about the impacts and effects
onshore facilities can have on the quality of their environments,''
said Johanna Wald, attorney for the San Francisco-based Natural
Resources Defense Council, which helped fight the claim.
   Western Oil spokesman Robert Getts said he didn't know if the
two associations would appeal the decision.

   The Communist Party chief in Soviet Georgia was
fired because of public protests about contaminated water that
caused an outbreak of typhoid fever in which 121 people were
hospitalized, it was reported Tuesday.
   No one died in the outbreak earlier this month in the city of
Tskhinvali, about 45 miles northwest of the Georgian capital of
Tbilisi, according to the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda.
   The first secretary of the regional Communist Party, F.S.
Sanakoev, was fired at a regional party meeting Saturday, a week
after protesters gathered in front of party headquarters to
complain about the water, Komsomolskaya Pravda said.
   It said that 87 percent of the people who responded to a March
31 survey said the inadequate water supply was the city's main
problem.
   ``In the best circumstances, there is only water in the homes in
the mornings and the evenings. Often there is none at all,''
Komsomolskaya Pravda said.
   The representative of the Georgian regional government appointed
a commission to propose a plan for improving the city's water
supply, but the protesters were not satisfied with the offer.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said regional leaders had been
negligent in not ensuring that a new water supply long under
construction be put into service.
   The first patient was hospitalized with what was diagnosed as
typhoid on April 2, and the outbreak reached its peak between April
11 and 15, when 121 people were hospitalized, according to the
newspaper Socialist Industry.

   The brother of a U.S. serviceman who died
eight years ago in Iran in a mission to rescue 52 American hostages
remembered the failed attempt with pride, not pain.
   ``Time is a great healer of pain,'' Air Force Capt. Richard
Holmes said Monday at a ceremony honoring the eight men who died in
the Iranian desert during the abortive rescue mission on April 25,
1980.
   ``Those feeling of sorrow have been replaced with feelings of
pride,'' said Holmes, the brother of Cpl. George Holmes Jr. of Pine
Bluff, Ark.
   The eight died when a helicopter collided with a transport plane
after officials decided to abandon the mission before entering
Tehran. The hostages were freed in January 1981 after 444 days in
captivity.
   Army Secretary John O. Marsh Jr., former hostages Bruce Laingen
and Air Force Col. David Roeder were among those attending the
30-minute ceremony, held at Arlington National Cemetery.

   A congressional watchdog agency says the Air
Force has provided billions of dollars worth of parts and supplies
to defense contractors without adequate control over how the
material is used.
   The General Accounting Office, in a report issued Monday,
estimated Air Force contractors were given more than $6 billion in
``government furnished material'' during 1986, the most recent year
for which complete statistics are available.
   That material covers an enormous range of items, from major
parts for airplanes and other equipment down to such items as
brooms, paint and bolts.
   Normally, the materials are supposed to be provided by
contractors, but the Pentagon has the option of supplying the
materials when it is in the government's best interest.
   The GAO said the service should tighten up its administrative
procedures to avoid the problem.

   Seven years after it was signed as a teaty, a
bill providing for the prompt return of children abducted from a
parent and taken to another country has won final approval by the
House.
   The measure, approved on Monday by voice vote, would implement
an international treaty on child abduction that the United States
signed in 1981 and the Senate approved five years later.
   The House, which had passed an almost identical bill March 28,
approved on Monday a slightly different Senate version giving
jurisdiction over international child abduction cases to both state
and federal courts.
   The measure is intended to remove difficult, time-consuming
legal issues involved in returning children abducted to another
country, often by the other parent, or helping foreign parents
recover children wrongfully taken to the United States.

   The manufacturer of baby swings that could
collapse is offering free replacements.
   Involved are 6,562 wooden baby swings sold under the Sears and
Hedstrom brand names. They were manufactured by Hedstrom Corp. of
Bedford, Pa., between April and December 1987, the Consumer Product
Safety Commission announced Monday.
   According to the agency, four incidents have been reported in
which the swings collapsed because the glue failed to hold the
joints between the slats and frame.
   The models being replaced are Hedstrom brand 4-798 and Sears
brand 512.70907, the commission said.
   Consumers should stop using the swing and return it to the place
of purchase for replacement. Those needing more information can

   The Reagan administration today affirmed its
determination to push a $460 million arms purchase by Saudi Arabia
through Congress with the argument that improving AWACS radar
planes is essential to protect U.S. Navy forces in the Persian Gulf.
   A bipartisan group of 187 House members has written Secretary of
State George P. Shultz opposing the sale of advanced equipment in
light of the Saudis' recent secret purchase of missiles from China
that could devastate Israel.
   But Charles E. Redman, the State Department spokesman, said the
Saudis have offered assurances the missiles would not be
nuclear-armed.
   ``We have not changed our view that the AWACS maintenance
package is critical to our gulf policy,'' he said. ``The Saudi
AWACS operation provides important support for the U.S. mission in
the gulf, including protection of U.S. Navy personnel.''
   American warships are protecting Kuwaiti oil tankers, outfitted
with U.S. flags, in the tanker war between Iran and Iraq. A number
of clashes with Iran have resulted.
   ``We expect to go forward with the formal notification in the
near term,'' Redman said.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said 186 other House members had
signed a letter he wrote urging Secretary of State George P. Shultz
to withdraw the proposed sale. The letter was to be forwarded to
Shultz today after additional signatures were gathered.
   Schumer made the announcement Monday after learning the State
Department planned to serve notice later that day of the proposed
sale, said spokesman Jay Genachowski. Formal notification
subsequently was postponed, he said.
   State Department spokesman Dennis Harter said the administration
had made no decision on when to formally notify Congress of the
arms sales, but that officials were ``doing some consultations'' on
the proposal, ``particularly since there has been some evidence of
congressional concern.''
   Congress has 30 days to pass legislation to block the arms sale
once it is formally announced.
   Those signing the letter maintained it would be rewarding Saudi
deceit to allow such a sale after recent disclosures that the
Saudis had secretly purchased medium-range ballistic missiles from
China.
   Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, today decided to sign the nuclear
weapons non-proliferation treaty. The decision, as reported by the
Saudi Press Agency, is an apparent effort to reassure the United
States that it will not try to arm its CSS-2 missiles with nuclear
warheads.
   The decision also could blunt Israel's allegations that the
missiles constituted a threat to its safety.
   The letter expresses concern that the Saudis ``went to such
lengths to conceal the missile purchase from the United States.''
   In a separate letter sent earlier, 58 senators urged Shultz to
rethink the proposed sale of Bradley fighting vehicles, TOW
missiles and ground support equipment for AWACS early-warning
aircraft.
   The House members' letter says it is U.S. policy to sustain
Israel's advantage in quality of arms over the advantage in numbers
possessed by more heavily populated Arab neighbors.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has expressed concern to the
Philippine government and its congress regarding proposed
legislation that would ban nuclear weapons in the Philippines, the
State Department said Tuesday.
   The legislation, on which debate began in Manila this week,
would prohibit nuclear weapons at the two major U.S. military bases
in the Philippines and would ban port calls by U.S. warships and
planes carrying such arms.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the United States
had told the Philippines that the bill ``would permit no
flexibility on nuclear matters and would be incompatible'' with
U.S. policy.
   That policy prohibits the United States from revealing whether
its ships and planes are carrying nuclear weapons.
   Redman declined to further discuss the Philippine legislation,
saying it was still in its early stages. The bill is expected to
pass the 23-member Senate, but would face strong opposition in the
200-member lower house.
   The United States has expressed strong opposition to such bans
in other countries. It expelled New Zealand from a Pacific defense
alliance with Australia after New Zealand adopted a nuclear ban,
and has protested similar action being considered in Denmark.

   Engineers today lifted a giant oven lid to
check a mirror that astronomers hope will lead to the next
generation of super telescopes, and the huge piece of cooling glass
was pronounced ``just fine.''
   ``I don't know how nervous you are, but I'm certainly feeling
it,'' Peter Strittmatter, director of the University of Arizona's
Steward Observatory, said Monday after engineers began spin-casting
glass into what they hope will become a honeycombed 11-foot mirror,
the largest ever to be made in that manner.
   Colleague Roger Angel is credited with the idea that he and
other Steward astronomers hoped would bear fruit.
   The first 24 hours, during which the mirror actually is molded,
are the most critical, Strittmatter said Monday. He said scientists
were lifting the lid today to get a view of a ``red-hot product.''
   Strittmatter said today the mirror apparently formed without any
problems but that engineers and astronomers will have to wait the
six weeks until they know for certain whether the mirror was
successfully produced.
   ``So far, so good,'' Angel said. ``The trick is to get it from
this temperature (about 1470 degrees Fahrenheit) down to room
temperature in one piece.''
   The mirror, a prototype for more powerful telescopes than now
exist, is to be sited at the Astrophysical Research Consortium
(ARC) telescope being built in the Sacramento Mountains near Sun
Spot, N.M.
   ARC is a joint project of five universities _ the University of
Chicago, Princeton, New Mexico State, University of Washington and
Washington State.
   ``The goal is obviously to make much bigger mirrors than we have
ever been able to make before,'' Strittmatter said.
   Traditional big mirrors have weighed four to five times more
than the two tons the finished 11-foot mirror will be, and have
required as many as two or three years to grind and polish, he said.
   In addition, they are slow to adjust to outside air temperature,
making for blurred images, and require large support structures and
buildings to house them, he said.
   The new technology offers many advantages, Angel and
Strittmatter said. Combined with a new technique for polishing the
glass blank with a more deeply curved surface, the mirror being
cast and those to follow will have short focal lengths resulting in
great cost savings through smaller buildings for the telescopes,
they added.
   Domed telescopes thus could become a thing of the past, said
Donald York of the University of Chicago.
   Strittmatter said the advances have spurred renewed worldwide
interest in astronomical research, with several new major
telescopes planned, including a binocular-like telescope with twin
26-foot mirrors called the Columbus Project that would be the
world's most powerful telescope. Collaborators include Italian
astronomers, the universities of Arizona and Chicago and Ohio State
University.
   Mirrors of 26 feet in diameter are considered the current limit,
given atmospheric distortion, Strittmatter said. The honeycombed
understructure, which makes for lightweight yet rigid construction,
helps minimize the distortion, he said.
   Thermal temperatures of the mirror can be controlled much more
effectively than in conventional telescope mirrors, he said.
   In the Steward Mirror Lab, beneath the stands of the
university's football stadium, the 19-foot furnace began spinning
about 8{ times a minute once its temperature reached 705 degrees
Celsius, or about 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit. The furnace began
heating late Saturday.
   Lab workers cast a 4-foot mirror in November with the same
spinning furnace.

   Michael Dukakis met Jesse Jackson in the
peaceful Pennsylvania primary on Tuesday as he bid to lengthen his
lead in convention delegates and certify his status as Democratic
presidential front-runner. George Bush sought the final delegates
needed to clinch the Republican nomination.
   Dukakis led Jackson by far in the pre-election polls after a
week-long campaign that looked and sounded more like a mutual
admiration society than the typical 1988 Democratic primary brawl.
   Aides hoped the Massachusetts governor would win the popular
vote impressively and claim as many as 150 of the 178 Democratic
National Convention delegates at stake.
   Jackson had scant hopes for a popular vote victory in
Pennsylvania, and already was looking ahead to next week's
primaries in the District of Columbia, Indiana and Ohio. His
chances in the delegate hunt were little better, since his campaign
failed to file a complete slate of delegate candidates around the
state.
   Dukakis looked to the Pennsylvania returns as the final count
was tallied from his victory in Utah's Monday night caucuses. The
New Englander was ahead for 19 of 23 delegates at stake.
   Dukakis began the day with 1,095.15 delegates, to 840.1 for
Jackson. It takes 2,081 to gain the nomination at the Democratic
National Convention in July in Atlanta.
   Bush had 1,081 of the 1,139 needed to nominate. Former
television evangelist Pat Robertson, who has ceased active
campaigning, had 31.
   ``We're putting Bush over the top,'' Pennsylvania State Chairman
Earl Baker said even before the polls closed. ``We're going to do
the same thing in November,'' he added.
   Bush's nomination has been all but assurred since he routed his
Republican rivals across the South on Super Tuesday last month, and
his aides have been working for weeks on their strategy for the GOP
convention in New Orleans and for the fall campaign against the
Democrats.
   The vice president has been running virtually uncontested for
weeks, winning primaries and caucuses as they rolled by on the
calendar and methodically claiming virtually all of the delegates
available.
   He needed to win only 58 of the 78 Pennsylvania delegates at
stake to amass a nominating majority in The Associated Press count.
   In contrast, Dukakis didn't take on the air of prohibitive
front-runner until a week ago, when he scored a decisive victory in
the New York primary and knocked Sen. Albert Gore Jr. from the race.
   That left only himself and Jackson as active candidates in the
once-crowded Democratic race, and his aides said they hoped for a
string of victories that would yield enough delegates to claim the
nomination by the time the primary season ends on June 7.

<HEAD>Law Doesn't Require EPA Action Against State Pollution Plans,
Court Told</HEAD>

   Congress never intended to allow states to
challenge other states' air pollution control plans in efforts to
reduce the precursors of acid rain, the Justice Department told a
federal appeals court Tuesday.
   Justice Department attorney Michael McCord said the
Environmental Protection Agency thus has no duty to order a group
of Midwestern states, at the behest of a coalition of Northeastern
states, to force pollution reductions on coal-burning utilities and
other sources.
   In the section of the Clean Air Act relied on by the
Northeastern states in a petition to the EPA, ``there is no
reference ... to a state (pollution control) implementation plan.
Congress' intent ... was to focus on a source or group of sources''
that might cause air pollution across a state line, not an entire
state or group of states, McCord told a three-judge panel of the
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   He said there was nothing in the history of the legislation
giving EPA the duty to act against entire states when other states
complain.
   The panel was hearing arguments for the second time in a lawsuit
brought against EPA by Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Connecticut,
Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
   The first argument in December 1985 had to be disregarded
because two of the three judges that heard it left the court _
Antonin Scalia to join the Supreme Court and Robert H. Bork by
resignation after the Senate rejected his nomination to the Supreme
Court.
   Tuesday's court hearing fell in the middle of three days of
rallies and news conferences arranged by environmental groups
seeking action against acid rain timed to coincide with the visit
Wednesday of Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who also has
been pressing the administration to reduce the northbound flow of
air pollution from the United States that causes acid rain.
   As part of those events, the International Maple Syrup Institute
said at a news conference U.S. syrup production had fallen 45
percent since 1981 and acid rain was ``the prime suspect.''
   A 1985-1986 aerial survey of 27,000 square miles of Quebec maple
stands showed 4 percent of the trees had lost more than 25 percent
of their leaves and were doomed to die, and 44 percent had lost 11
percent to 25 percent of their leaves and were badly damaged, the
institute said.
   Though researchers are still seeking the cause of maple decline,
``there is unquestionably a significant correlation between the
death of maple trees and acid rain,'' Institute President David
Scanlan said.
   The institute and the American Forestry Association both called
for enactment of pending revisions to the Clean Air Act that would
institute an acid rain control program and other measures. But R.
Neil Sampson, executive vice president of the forestry association,
said, ``For me to say how much acid rain is affecting (syrup)
production is something I can't do.''
   The Northeastern states are appealing EPA's rejection of their
petition requesting the agency to order revisions in the air
pollution control plans of Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky,
Tennessee, West Virginia and Illinois to reduce emissions of sulfur
dioxide, a principal precursor of acid rain.
   There are no federal laws on acid rain, so the complaining
states had to argue that Pennsylvania, Maine and New York could not
meet various other federal air quality standards because of the
Midwestern sulfur dioxide.
   The Clean Air Act has a section requiring the EPA administrator
to make sure that one state's air pollution control plan does not
cause impermissible pollution in another state before he approves
the plan or revisions to it.
   In answering the Northeastern petitions, EPA said it did not
know enough to tell the allegedly offending states how to revise
their plans.
   For the Northeastern states, Greg Sample of the Maine attorney
general's office argued that opponents were overestimating the
effects of granting the petition.
   ``It is not fair to say that our petition seeks to evaluate all
sources or even all major sources'' of sulfur dioxide,'' he said.
``We have constantly urged the administrator (of EPA) to
concentrate on the 50 major sources'' in the Midwest.

   Dukakis and Jackson debated twice in their Pennsylvania primary
campaign, treating one another with exceptional good humor while
attacking Bush and the Reagan administration.
   The Democratic rivals held their hands aloft like prizefighters
in a gesture of unity at one debate and proceeded to joke about the
vice presidential slot on the ticket _ the No. 1 topic on the minds
of Democrats everywhere.
   ``Are you interested?'' Dukakis asked Jackson in a soft,
back-stage voice.
   Dukakis even held a private meeting during the week with some of
Jackson's black supporters in Pennsylvania _ with his rival's
advance knowledge and approval.
   Said Jackson: ``However it goes, when it's all said and done ...
we will come out (of the convention) as a unit to send the
Reagan-Bush forces back to private life.''
   Dukakis also began pointing his attack toward the Republicans
during the week, saying it would be a ``tragedy'' if Reagan vetoed
a trade bill over a provision requiring companies to give notice
before closing manufacturing facilities.
   Jackson got entangled the last two days of the campaign in a
flap over how to deal with terrorists, particularly in situations
where they were holding Americans hostage.
   In a speech Sunday in Washington, D.C., Jackson took issue with
Dukakis' hard-line statements opposed to negotiations with
terrorists.
   ``I disagree with that,'' said Jackson. ``If I could get the
hostages out, I'd do it.''
   The next day he was peppered with questions about whether he was
implying he would make concessions to hostage-takers.
   He rejected what he called ``material concessions,'' such as
selling arms. But he added, ``I choose negotiation over blind
bloody confrontation'' and said he would consider allowing
terrorists safe passage in exchange for release of hostages.
   He also said, ``If we are going to deter terrorism we are going
to have to address the underlying caucses of terrorism. Terrorism
does not emerge out of the blue.''
   Bush promised to continue ``showing the flag'' in the remainder
of the primary season, despite his certain nonmination, and he had
a feisty rejoinder when hecklers dogged him at one stop in
Pennsylvania.
   ``I'm glad to see the Jackson supporters here, or maybe the Mike
Dukakis supporters,'' he said. ``I welcome then in debate, and I
will welcome taking on their ticket and we will beat them in the
fall.''
   Bush's aides said the vice president might soon begin focusing
his criticism more specifically on Dukakis and less on Democrats in
general. Campaign manager Lee Atwater provided a preview when he
described the Democratic front-runner as a ``Northern fried Jimmy
Carter,'' the man turned out of office in 1980 by the Reagan-Bush
ticket.
   Bush's spokesman also said the vice president intends to summon
Republican governors and experts to his home in Kennebunkport,
Maine for a week-long brainstorming session in June to help shape
the foreign policy and economic issues for the fall campaign.

<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS one graf after 3rd pvs with Haldey ordered held

   Steven Hadley ditched his wife and job
in Iowa five years ago and started a secret life here with a new
wife, but he attracted police curiosity when he paid cash for a
house and expensive cars.
   Police Lt. Gary Edwards finally unraveled the mystery
surrounding Hadley after seeing his picture on an FBI flier issued
in connection with the television series ``Unsolved Mysteries.''
   Authorities said Hadley, 40, was arrested Monday and accused of
embezzling $1.1 million from the John Deere Employees Credit Union
in Waterloo, Iowa, where he had worked for 10 years and was
described as a reliable and respected employee.
   U.S. Magistrate George Kelt today ordered Hadley held without
bond at least until a detention hearing, which was scheduled for
Friday afternoon, FBI spokesman Johnie Joyce said.
   ``Hadley admitted his identity following his arrest,'' said
Nicholas V. O'Hara, FBI special agent in charge of the district
office at Omaha, Neb.
   FBI agents and police called Hadley and asked him to come to the
police station to discuss a neighborhood juvenile case that Hadley
and his new wife had reported.
   ``I showed him the flier and asked him if he was Hadley and he
answered, `Yes, I am,''' Edwards said. ``There was a big sigh of
relief and then he said, `I'll cooperate fully however I can.'''
   Hadley was reported missing by his wife and family in July 1983,
the same time the money disappeared from the credit union.
   Authorities believe Hadley took a July 21 flight to Chicago, but
were unable to track him. He called home to alert his wife to a
letter he left behind saying he took the money and fled because he
``could no longer cope with home and work pressures.''
   In part of the letter included in federal court documents,
Hadley wrote to his wife that, ``This is a very difficult letter to
write but I couldn't let you find out from someone else first. If I
call you to read this letter, it means that I have successfully
left the state with around $1 million from the credit union.''
   In Iowa, his wife, Kathryn, has divorced him and retained
custody of their three children _ who were 11, 7 and a year old
when their father disappeared.
   For the past three years, Edwards and others at the Friendswood
Police Department have been researching Hadley after he bought a
home and two expensive sports cars in cash, but had no visible
means of support.
   Edwards said Hadley had been in Friendswood, south of Houston,
since 1984 when he bought his house, a Ferrari and an Alfa Romeo.
   ``We did a reverse investigation,'' Edwards said. ``We
researched how he came into a lot of money. When he bought his
house and fancy cars in cash, people were suspicious.''
   ``There was no doubt in my mind it was him when I saw the
flier,'' he said. ``I was shocked. I probably have 600 pages of
reports on this guy from the last three years and he looks the
same.''
   Hadley has since remarried and Edwards says the new wife had no
idea of Hadley's real identity.
   He is being held pending an appearance before a U.S. magistrate.
   Hopes of catching Hadley rose in February when producers of the
NBC-TV's ``Unsolved Mysteries'' arrived in Waterloo to prepare for
a segment on the missing cash and credit union employee.
   The Hadley segment was scheduled to be broadcast next month.
   During the show, viewers are provided with a telephone number to
call if they can identify a photo of the subject.

<HEAD>Museum Visitor Points Out Error In Remington Work</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bronze cowboy sculpture ``The Rattlesnake''
by famed Western artist Frederic Remington stopped museum visitor
Cy Baumgartner in his tracks _ the cowboy's tiny spurs were on
upside down.
   ``There's no way a cowboy would wear his spurs pointing up like
that,'' said Baumgartner, a former rodeo cowboy who now drives a
beer truck and raises quarter horses. ``It would be totally out of
character.''
   Baumgartner, who was touring the Remington exhibit Sunday at the
St. Louis Art Museum, apparently was the first to notice the error.
   ``I saw it immediately,'' he said. ``I just think it's funny
that nobody noticed it before now.''
   After Baumgartner pointed out the problem, museum workers
checked other bronzes on display.
   They found that all the spurs on the four horsemen in a casting
of ``Coming Through The Rye'' were also upside down.
   Peter H. Hassrick, one of the curators of the exhibit, said he
has occasionally noticed similar problems with Remington works in
private collections. He said he hadn't noticed the problem in the
St. Louis exhibit.
   But that doesn't necessarily mean that Remington, the famed
sculptor and painter of Western themes who lived from 1861 to 1909,
made the error.
   The spurs on the bronzes and other small pieces were cast
separately from the main work and, as a result, it was sometimes
left to a foundry worker with little knowledge of a cowboy's gear
to attach the spurs to the boots.
   On other occasions, Hassrick said, the spurs may have been
damaged and replacement spurs attached turned the wrong way.
   ``It's just a silly little thing, but I'm sure Remington wold
have liked to have seen them the right way,'' Hassrick said.
   ``If they were on one of our bronzes, we'd turn them around,''
said Hassrick, director of the Buffalo Bill Historical Center in
Cody, Wyo., and an authority on Remington.
   Neither of the works in question, however, is owned by the
museum. ``The Rattlesnake'' casting is from a private collection,
and the casting of ``Coming Through the Rye'' is on loan from
Princeton University.
   The exhibit is open in St. Louis through May 22.

the Federal Railroad Administration from 1983 to 1987 and assistant
press secretary to Durenberger from 1980 to 1983.
   Petroskey left the department to accept a position with the
National Geographic Society.
   The White House also said Reagan plans to appoint Roger L.
Stevens, chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing
Arts, to the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities.
   In addition, the president will nominate Jane A. Kenny, now

   Two Navy navigational
satellites that put on a spectacular light show after launch
reached their planned circular polar orbit Tuesday, officials at
this coastal base said.
   A NASA consultant at Vandenberg, Don Forney, said the launch
aboard a Scout rocket Monday evening went ``by the numbers.''
   Forney said solar panels that charge the batteries powering the
satellite were deployed on one of the satellites shortly after it
reached orbit. The spare satellite will be stored in orbit until
needed. The functional satellite will be operational in 10 days.
   The OSCAR satellites, each weighing 131 pounds, are used as a
navigational system for submarines and commercial shipping, as well
as in oil and mineral deposit work.
   Their 6:57 p.m. launch left an exhaust contrail clearly visible
from Malibu, about 100 miles to the south.
   The contrail was the result of a ``twilight phenomenon,'' said
Master Sgt. Bruce Zielsdorf, a Vandenberg spokesman.
   ``It is the result of spent fuel from the booster rocket as it
travels through the upper atmosphere. The fuel combines with water
droplets that crystallize,'' he said.
   ``Those crystals are struck by high-altitude sunlight,'' he
added. ``It may be dark on Earth, but there's still sunlight above.
It causes an aurora borealis effect and is usually visible for 15
to 20 minutes.''
   The contrail, which reflected shades of blue and green over
Orange County, resembled a giant pretzel in that area after it was
blown by high-altitude winds.

   Accused drug kingpin Carlos Lehder
Rivas virtually admitted his guilt in radio and television
interviews given in 1983 and 1985, federal prosecutors claimed
Tuesday as they argued for the interviews to be presented at his
trial.
   But defense attorney Jose Quinon, arguing against allowing the
jury to see and hear the tapes, claimed that Lehder, 38, was being
tried for his political views instead of the 11-count indictment.
   The indictment alleges Lehder and co-defendant Jack Reed
conspired to smuggle some 3.3 tons of cocaine into the United
States from Colombia.
   Defense and prosecution attorneys went line-by-line over
transcripts of a radio interview and a television interview Lehder
gave in late June 1983, before he was indicted in U.S. courts; and
a jungle television interview given in February 1985, when Lehder
was a fugitive on the charges for which he is now being tried.
   The jury was excused during the arguments.
   ``The entire statement amounts to a confession,'' said U.S.
Attorney Robert W. Merkle, when discussing a section of the radio
transcript that dealt with Lehder's activities on the island of
Norman's Cay in the Bahamas.
   ``This is his manifesto,'' said Merkle, who added that Lehder
equated his cocaine smuggling with the liquor smuggling in the
United States during the Prohibition era.
   ``This is a very eloquent statement ... that Mr. Lehder is in
fact guilty,'' said Merkle, after reviewing the transcript of the
audio tape.
   Quinon charged that certain parts of the tapes are highly
prejudicial and should not be admitted into evidence.
   ``This has become a political trial, nothing more, nothing
less,'' said Quinon.
   ``This is not a political trial. This is not a political
crime,'' answered Merkle, who added that Lehder smuggled drugs to
further his political views.
   It now appears that the prosecution may rest its case on
Thursday. U.S. District Judge Howell W. Melton said he may recess
most of Wednesday to allow him to determine whether the tapes,
which are in Spanish, can be admitted into evidence.
   Lehder is charged with conspiracy, possession of cocaine with
intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and operating a
continuing criminal enterprise. Reed, 57, of San Pedro, Calif., is
charged only with being a member of the smuggling conspiracy.

<HEAD>Danes Told to Choose Between Nuclear Ban and NATO</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY GERBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Political leaders are telling Danes
to choose in upcoming elections between NATO allies and the
country's longstanding ban on nuclear weapons.
   Prime Minister Poul Schlueter, a NATO backer, called the
parliamentary elections for May 10, urging voters to ``take a
stand'' in favor of the Western military alliance.
   The sudden storm over Denmark's role in the 16-nation alliance
came as a surprise to many voters. The peacetime ban on nuclear
weapons has been in effect for three decades, and a shaky coalition
government has been struggling with economic, not military issues.
   Indeed, some voters say economic troubles remain the chief issue.
   ``It's not just a question about nuclear weapons but about the
way the government runs society,'' said Susane Nielsen, a
conservative voter who works in a health insurance office. ``We
have to face these economic problems.''
   The unexpected showdown began April 14 when the leftist
opposition pushed through a parliamentary resolution intended to
strengthen the country's ban on peacetime nuclear weapons.
   The move, which has been delayed pending the election, requires
the government to notify individual warships of the country's ban.
Parliamentary negotiators have not decided if the ships would then
have to respond.
   Until now, Denmark has simply stated its policy to one and all.
   Some allies reacted sharply to the latest proposal, warning it
jeopardizes Denmark's participation in NATO. A meeting of NATO's
Nuclear Planning Group was rescheduled from Denmark to Belgium.
Britain called off naval maneuvers in Denmark.
   Some Danes have reacted with resentment to the foreign
pressures. ``Has the Danes' national pride deteriorated so much
that we will bow to pressure from abroad?'' the left-leaning
newspaper Information asked in a front-page editorial.
   ``The question is the central one in the current debate, and in
that sense, the election is the most important since World War II.''
   Of course, it did not help matters when Reagan administration
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater joked to reporters that ``Danish means
breakfast to me.''
   National radio played the English-language tape on the air, an
unusual step. ``Reagan Staff Demonstrates its Knowledge of
Denmark,'' said a sarcastic headline in the liberal Politiken
newspaper. Fitzwater later apologized.
   The confrontation comes at a politically unstable time for this
country of 5 million people. The last general election in September
left Schlueter's center-right coalition in command of just 70 of
parliament's 179 votes _ just enough to command a majority on
economic matters.
   Polls suggest that Danes favor NATO membership. A recently
published poll by the Observa organization showed that 66 percent
of Danes favor staying in NATO and just 16 percent oppose it, the
most lopsided margin in years. A Gallup poll said Danes favor
membership 59 percent to 16 percent.
   Another survey, published in the Boersen business newspaper,
showed that 46 percent of Danes believed it was reasonable to ask
NATO ships to guarantee they carry no nuclear arms, 36 percent did
not and 18 percent were undecided. The responses crossed political
lines.
   Further strains in relations between Denmark and its allies
could carry strategic implications. Denmark's low-lying peninsula
and islands command approaches to the Baltic Sea, and NATO
strategists envision it as a key supply point in case of invasion
from the east.
   The dispute follows years of contention over Denmark's declining
defense spending, which amounts to 2 percent of its gross national
product, among the lowest in the alliance.
   However, random interviews with window shoppers along Stroeget,
a pedestrian street in Copenhagen, suggest many people are more
worried about the country's weak economy than its military role.
   Unemployment is running at 9.7 percent, and the national debt
has reached $43 billion.
   Joergen Thy, editor and writer for a computer magazine, said he
planned to vote against the government because ``I don't think they
have achieved much.''
   He calls the nuclear question `` a joke.'' ``That's not the
issue,'' he says.
   Indeed, Danish elections have focused mainly on economic issues
since World War II.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who has
sought to improve relations with Eastern Europe, discussed human
rights and economic issues Tuesday with the highest-ranking
Bulgarian official to visit Washington since World War II.
   Andrei Lukanov, minister of foreign economic relations, outlined
Bulgarian plans to improve its economy and told Shultz his country
was eager to increase trade with the United States through joint
ventures, a State Department official said.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the talks
were ``cordial, relaxed and businesslike.''
   Shultz reminded Lukanov of the U.S. concerns about Bulgarian
treatment of its Turkish minority, the official said. The State
Department, Amnesty International and others have accused Bulgaria
of seeking to force assimilation on 900,000 people of Turkish
origin.
   Under a 1975 law, Bulgaria and other Soviet allies remain
ineligible for special U.S. tariff reductions _ most favored nation
status _ as long as their emigration policies are deemed by the
United States to be restrictive.
   In practice, a nation's entire human rights policies are
scrutinized before a decision is made on most favored nation status.
   Bulgaria has sought to join Poland, Hungary and Romania as
Soviet-bloc countries eligible for the benefits, but the request
has been denied. The State Department official said the issue was
not raised with Lukanov, who is the first Bulgarian politburo
member to visit Washington since Bulgaria became a communist
country following World War II.
   ``This was basically an overview of relations, rather than a
detailed discussion of economic issues,'' the official said.
   Bulgaria traditionally has taken its economic and foreign policy
cues from the Soviet Union and its recent moves to improve
efficiency and add marketplace approaches to the economy have
mirrored similar efforts by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Like the Soviet Union, Bulgaria also has sought to increase the
amount of high technology it is permitted to buy in the United
States.
   Lukanov's visit to the United States will include a trip to the
northern California region known as Silicon Valley because of its
numerous high-tech industries and to Los Angeles, Chicago and New
York.
   In recent years, the Reagan administration has sought to improve
its diplomatic relations with Soviet bloc coun the past three years.

   Local officials are scrambling to
avert a financial crisis as a $230,000 payroll comes due Friday
with only $884 in the city's bank account to cover it.
   Officials of this financially strapped Southern Illinois city
laid off 25 city employees on Monday and the treasurer's office was
closed for the day in cost-saving measures.
   But Treasurer Charlotte R. Moore, who lost all her regular
workers in the cutback, said the layoffs might not save enough
money to keep the city solvent.
   ``They laid off my administrative assistant and two
accountants,'' as well as four other workers, said Ms. Moore.
``They didn't leave anyone in here.''
   She said an expected infusion of money from state sales-tax
receipts may not provide enough cash to cover the city's debts,
which include the $230,000 city payroll, a $29,000 monthly garbage
contract and a monthly $29,000 payment on a $3.4 million lawsuit
judgment.
   Disputes over payment for garbage pickup and the recent court
judgment have added to the woes of this economically depressed
city. Officials have said they must trim about $144,000 a month
from the budget to keep the municipality from going bankrupt.
   To help Ms. Moore's office function, three workers from other
departments were transferred into the treasurer's office. But Ms.
Moore said she was unhappy with the transfers, which replaced
accountants and account clerks wth clerk-typists and reference
clerks.
   Ms. Moore and City Clerk Alzada Carr, who lost one of her three
employees to the layoffs, said they were to meet with their
attorneys to determine whether they can take legal action to
prevent the gutting of their offices.
   Ms. Carr said the loss of her deputy reference clerk _ one of
those transferred to the treasurer's office _ kept her from being
able to fill all the requests for city documents received Monday.

<HEAD>Jury Clears Mick Jagger Of Stealing Reggae Musician's Song</HEAD>

   A federal court jury found today that
Mick Jagger did not steal an unknown reggae musician's song and
turn it into his 1985 hit, ``Just Another Night.''
   Fans in the courtroom broke into applause after the verdict, and
Jagger said he planned to celebrate by having a beer with his
lawyers.
   ``My reputation is really cleared. If you're well-known, people
stand up and take shots at you. It's one of those things in a
litigious society,'' Jagger told reporters.
   The six-person civil panel had listened to tapes of both
Jagger's song and one written in 1979 by Patrick Alley, 36, which
is also named ``Just Another Night.''
   ``I still believe and I know that's my song,'' said Alley, 36,
who had accused Jagger of copyright infringement.
   Shortly before issuing the verdict, jurors asked for a rereading
of the law on access. They were apparently trying to determine
whether Jagger could have heard or known about Alley's song prior
to writing his own.
   Alley's lawyers said Jagger made $6 million from the song, which
appeared on an album called ``She's the Boss.''
   Jagger, looking weary, had testified Monday, rebutting a
statement by Alley's attorneys that longtime collaborator Keith
Richards tended to write the music while Jagger handled the lyrics.
   Jagger was gracious to fans throughout the trial, but pushed
angrily through a mob as he left the courthouse Monday night.
Crowds waiting to see the rock legend broke a door at the small
courthouse, according to security officials.
   Two alternate jurors, dismissed when the jury began
deliberations, said they also would have found for Jagger.
   ``I think he did it independently,'' said Barbara Carroll of
Pelham, who found Jagger to be a ``gentleman. . . He's completely
different than what I thought from his videos.'' Her children,
ranging from 16 to 25, are fans.

   A real estate executive for the wealthy Bender
family of Washington testified Tuesday before a grand jury
investigating a job the Benders arranged for the wife of Attorney
General Edwin Meese III while leasing office space to the Justice
Department.
   Stephen Lustgarten, a vice president of the family's Blake
Construction Co., testified for nearly two hours to the grand jury
convened by independent counsel James C. McKay to investigate
conflict-of-interest allegations involving the attorney general's
personal finances.
   Lustgarten witnessed the signature of Howard M. Bender on the
$50 million lease renewal the partnership signed with the Justice
Department to continue to provide office space here to the
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   The renewal was signed 13 days before the Bender partnership
sold the office building for $22.6 million more than it had paid
for it two years earlier _ a 60 percent profit.
   In October 1985, the Bender family foundation donated money to
the Multiple Sclerosis Society to finance Ursula Meese's
$40,000-a-year job for three years. Mrs. Meese, who was questioned
last week by the grand jury, had worked for the charity as a
volunteer until joining its paid staff in 1986.
   Both Bender and his wife, Sondra, have also been questioned by
the grand jury.
   Lustgarten, who works in Blake Construction's real estate
division, declined to comment as he left the grand jury with his
attorney, Seymour Glanzer, who also represents the Benders.

   President Reagan said today that school
reforms pushed by his administration had brought ``truly
revolutionary'' changes to American schools, including a new
emphasis on discipline and homework that is paying off in better
results.
   ``We still have a long way to go,'' Reagan said after Secretary
of Education William J. Bennett presented a progress report on the
schools. ``I'm confident this report will help us find the way.''
   Reagan held a White House ceremony to mark the fifth anniversary
of the National Commission on Excellence in Education's biting
critique, ``A Nation At Risk,'' that spawned efforts in nearly
every state to raise academic standards and the pay and performance
of teachers.
   Reagan said the earlier report, commissioned by Bennett's
predecessor, T.H. Bell, ``helped heighten and acclerate a wave of
education reform in states and communities all around the country.''
   He said it led many states to install career ladders and merit
pay for teachers, and many schools placed ``a new emphasis on
quality and discipline, more homework, more attention to basic
skills.''
   ``This was truly revolutionary after two decades in which money
had been the only measure of progress in education and in which
while federal spending on education went steadily up, test scores
fell steadily downward. Too many schools accepted the fashions of
the day, fashions of liberal culture that held traditional
standards in scorn,'' Reagan said.
   Earlier, 350 National Education Association members rallied in
Lafayette Park across from the White House to protest the report.
Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., R-Conn., drew applause when he called
Bennett ``the secretary of ignorance.'
   NEA President Mary Hatwood Futrell said Bennett's report was an
attempt to ``whitewash'' the administration's failure to fulfill
its obligation to help improve schools.
   ``American educatioan can be made to work better and it can be
made to work better now,'' Reagan told the 200 people gathered in
the East Room of the White House.
   Bell was not invited to the ceremony. Eight of the 18 members of
the National Commission on Excellence in Education did attend,
including University of California President David Gardner, who
said afterwards of the Bennett report, ``It was timely, helpful,
tended to be constructive. I believe it could have been written in
a more positive fashion. ... I also think it was short in terms of
the role the federal government ought to be playing.''
   Bennett said in presenting the report to the president,
``American education has made some progress in the last few years.
... But we are not doing well enough, and we are not doing well
enough fast enough. We are still at risk.''
   ``If our schools are to improve, the powerful resistance to
reform must be overcome. ... The nation's modest success over the
past five yers is both proof of reform's possibilities and a
summons to renewed effort,'' Bennett said.
   ``I guarantee you we will seize the opportunity to elect a
pro-education president of the United States,'' said Ms. Futrell in
addressing the protesters. ``Only then will we have a secretary of
education more interested in leadership than in showmanship.''
   The NEA was one of the few major education groups not invited to
the ceremony.
   ``A Nation At Risk'' made headlines and laid the groundwork for
moves in
   ``I think it's an excellent report, a good summary of what
progress has been made and also of what remains to be done,'' Bell
said in a telephone interview from Salt Lake City.
   But Bell said he wished the report had given greater emphasis to
``what the federal government should be doing,'' especially on the
``horrendous problem'' of 40 percent dropout rates for minority
youths.
   Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of
Teachers, said, ``If Secretary Bennett and the president really
feel that the nation is still at risk, they ought to propose
something that the federal government does to get us out of this
mess other than just preaching at everyone else.''
   Bennett's report said: ``American education has made some
undeniable progress in the last few years. The precipitous downward
slide of previous decades has been arrested, and we have begun the
long climb back to reasonable standards.
   ``We are doing better than we were in 1983. But we are certainly
not doing well enough. ... We are still at risk.''
   Scott D. Thomson, executive director of the National Association
of Secondary School Principals, said:
   ``He doesn't recognize that we've made these gains at the same
time we've admitted over 2 million non-English speaking immigrant
students to the school population ... (and) in the face of growing
numbers of poor families.
   ``He doesn't recognize the fact that we're fending off the drug
pushers with one hand from the community and trying to teach them
with the other.''

<HEAD>Consumer Spending Helps Economy Grow By 2.3 Percent In First
Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strong spending by American consumers helped
the economy grow at a healthy 2.3 percent annual rate during the
first three months of 1988, the government said Tuesday, dispelling
fear of any lingering ill effects from the October stock market
crash.
   The Commerce Department, in its first look at overall economic
peformance this year, said consumer spending, the biggest surge in
business investment in more than four years and growing exports
kept the gross national product rising despite declines in
government spending and housing construction.
   ``So much for the recession that was supposed to occur in the
first quarter,'' said Commerce Undersecretary Robert Ortner. ``...
Whatever the impact (of the crash) was, it's pretty much behind
us.''
   ``I think these are uncommonly good GNP numbers,'' said Jerry
Jasinowski, chief economist of the National Association of
Manufacturers.
   Early this year, economists had feared the evaporation of $500
billion in wealth during the Oct. 19 stock market crash would scare
consumers, whose spending represents two-thirds of the economy, and
cause a drastic slowdown or even a recession.
   But as signs of strength accumulated through the quarter, most
analysts began expecting moderate growth about in line with what
was reported Tuesday. Interest rates on bonds, which likely would
have risen on news of stronger-than-expected growth, showed little
reaction to the GNP report.
   The economy had expanded at a much faster 4.8 percent rate in
the October-December quarter, but most of the increased production
went into inventories and consumer spending actually dropped.
   That combination often presages a recession. Manufacturers,
faced with a backlog of unsold goods, cut production and lay off
workers.
   However, consumer spending rebounded by $23.6 billion in the
first quarter, a 3.8 percent annual rate of increase, with more
than half of that growth coming in auto sales.
   In turn, business inventories, which had risen by $39.4 billion
in the fourth quarter, fell by $13.2 billion in the first quarter.
Ortner said automakers are now well positioned to increase
production, adding 1 percent or more to second quarter GNP.
   Business investment for capital equipment shot up at an annual
rate of 32.5 percent in the first quarter, the fastest advance
since a 39.5 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 1983. Much
of the strength there came in computers.
   Beryl Sprinkel, the president's chief economic adviser, told a
White House briefing that the big boost in capital spending should
help ease inflationary pressures.
   As manufacturers in industries running at almost full capacity
expand their factories, production bottlenecks and resulting price
increases gradually will become less likely, he said.
   The rate of inflation as measured by the GNP rose at an annual
rate of 2.4 percent in the January-March quarter, down from a 2.7
increase in the fourth quarter.
   ``The economy is on track for moderate further expansion and for
restrained inflation in 1988,'' Sprinkel said.
   In other good news, the country's trade deficit, after removing
the effects of inflation, narrowed by $3.6 billion in the first
quarter, continuing the trend of improvement that began in mid-1986.
   However, Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co., said an
increase in imports, although slower rate than the rise in exports,
was troubling. Exports rose 10.2 percent in the quarter, while
imports rose 5.2 percent.
   ``The problem with trade remains too many imports. Americans are
not yet buying American,'' Sinai said.
   The administration, which is looking for a sixth straight year
of economic growth to boost chances for a Republican presidential
win in November, has forecast that GNP will grow 2.9 percent for
the full year.
   The administration is counting on further improvements in the
trade deficit to supply almost half of the growth. Much of the rest
is expected to come from higher business capital spending as
companies expand to meet a growing export demand.
   In another report, the government said that after-tax corporate
profits rose an even faster 2.6 percent in the final three months
of 1987. This was an upward revision from a month ago, when the
government put the increase in business profits at 1.6 percent.
   Two factors that held back GNP growth in the first quarter were
a 9.4 percent drop in residential construction spending and a 22.3
percent drop in spending by the federal government, reflecting in
large part a swing in farm subsidy payments.
   The various changes pushed the GNP, after adjusting for
inflation, up by $21.8 billion, to a new annual rate of $3.90
trillion.

<HEAD>Administration Asks High Court to Scrap Special Prosecutor Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration urged the Supreme
Court on Tuesday to scrap a federal law used to prosecute several
former White House aides and to investigate Attorney General Edwin
Meese III.
   The law gives too much power to people ``totally untethered to
any politically responsible person,'' argued Solicitor General
Charles Fried, the Justice Department's top courtroom lawyer.
   Disputed provisions in the Ethics in Government Act of 1978
allow independent counsels, formerly called special prosecutors, to
investigate alleged misconduct by key executive-branch officials.
   Fried said such investigations should be conducted only by
officials answerable to the president.
   Independent counsel Alexia Morrison, defending the law, said
Congress wanted to ``preclude the appearance or the reality of a
conflict of interest'' arising from an administration investigating
itself.
   The high court's decision, expected by July, could help define
the nation's political life in future years.
   The decision also could affect the criminal convictions of
former White House aides Michael K. Deaver and Lyn Nofziger and the
Iran-Contra affair prosecutions of ex-White House aides John M.
Poindexter and Oliver North.
   Ms. Morrison is investigating allegations that Theodore B.
Olson, a former assistant attorney general, lied to Congress in
1983 during a dispute over the Environmental Protection Agency's
cleanup program for toxic waste sites.
   A federal appeals court ruled the independent counsel law is an
unconstitutional encroachment on the president's power to enforce
criminal laws.
   Fried urged the justices to uphold the appeals court ruling,
saying the law ``strips the president of a purely executive
function _ criminal prosecution.''
   He said the law also wrongly ``absolves Congress of its
weightiest and most painful duty'' _ serving as a watchdog for
abuses of executive power. Fried said the proper remedy for such
misconduct is impeachment by Congress.
   Olson's lawyer, Thomas S. Martin, added that the law ``radically
alters the structure of how we are governed.''
   Joining Ms. Morrison in defending the law during a 90-minute
argument session was Michael Davidson, the Senate's chief lawyer.
   Davidson fielded questions from several justices who voiced
concern about the law's empowering a special court, rather than the
president or his subordinates, to appoint special prosecutors. He
said such appointment power is a minor aspect of the law.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist seemed less than convinced.
``You cannot assign to one branch certain functions that inherently
belong to the other,'' he said.
   But Rehnquist also asked Martin, Olson's lawyer, why the
special-prosecutor provision was dissimilar from Congress routinely
placing limits on a president's power to remove one of his
executive-branch appointees.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall asked Martin, ``Shouldn't a prosecutor
be independent? What's wrong with it?''
   The case is being decided by eight justices because Justice
Anthony M. Kennedy has disqualified himself for unexplained reasons.
   His absence creates the possibility of a 4-4 tie, which would
have the effect of automatically upholding the appeals court
decision invalidating the law.
   Asked by reporters whether that possibility concerned her, Ms.
Morrison would not comment, saying only, ``I will anxiously await
the court's ruling.''
   Martin said he did not expect an evenly divided court. ``I think
a consensus will emerge, and I don't expect a 4-4 split,'' he said.
   Deaver was convicted of perjury earlier this year for lying to a
grand jury and a House subcommittee that investigated his lobbying
activities.
   Poindexter, North and two others were indicted in special
prosecutor Lawrence Walsh's investigation of the Iran-Contra affair.
   Independent counsel James C. McKay, who successfully prosecuted
Nofziger for illegal lobbying, also is investigating Meese in
connection with possible financial conflicts of interest.

<HEAD>San Francisco Rationing Plan Would Limit Use And Raise Rates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An emergency water rationing plan under
consideration in the city would close down decorative public
fountains and prohibit restaurants from giving water to customers
unless they ask for it.
   The second phase of the proposal by the city's Water Department
would require each resident and business to pay a higher rate for
less water by the end of May.
   The conservation plan, which will be considered Thursday by the
Public Utilities Commission, would begin Sunday. It would allow
each home or business a water allocation based on a 25 percent
reduction of the amount of water it used in 1987.
   Washing down sidewalks or patios with drinking water would be
prohibited under the plan. Fountains, including those in Civic
Center, United Nations Plaza and the Villiancourt Fountain near the
Ferry Building, would be shut off.
   Washing a car with a hose would be prohibited unless the hose
has a shut-off valve.
   The increase, which has not yet been determined, would accompany
penalties for using more water than the allocation. The city will
also consider placing flow restrictors on water lines in homes or
businesses that do not cut use.
   Water rationing is necessary because of two dry years in a row,
water officials said. Last week's rains did little to increase
runoff from melting snow in the Tuolumne River watershed, where the
San Francisco area gets most of its drinking water. Runoff was 34
percent of normal as of Monday, officials said.
   San Francisco would be the second water system in the area to
impose rationing. The East Bay Municipal Utility District last week
adopted a flat daily allocation of 400 gallons for its 1.1 million
customers.

<HEAD>Seven Indicted For Allegedly Bilking $800,000 From Coin Investors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A company used a videotaped appeal from
famed test pilot Chuck Yeager and the promise that profits from its
sales would fund a veterans park to lure investors into losing
$800,000 in a fake medallion scam, prosecutors said.
   The 37-count federal indictment, issued last week and unsealed
Monday, names seven individuals and two companies, Can-Am Mint and
Trading Ltd., which had offices in Bloomington and Eden Prairie,
and Vets for Vets Inc., which was incorporated in South Dakota but
shared offices with Can-Am.
   ``Many of these victims are very elderly people and a number
have lost members of their families in Vietnam,'' said Assistant
U.S. Attorney Joan Ericksen. ``They are an extremely vulnerable
group of victims.''
   Among the victims, one elderly North Dakota man sent in $81,000
and received nothing in return, Ericksen said. In all, she said,
about 45 investors from as far away as California, North Carolina
and Texas were involved.
   The indictment alleges that since March 1986 the defendants
tried to induce veterans and other investors to buy 3-ounce silver
commemorative medallions for $99 each, and promised that the
medallions would increase in value by 12 percent in a year. Only a
few of the investors received the medallions, Ericksen said.
   The investors were assured that half the profits would be used
by Vets for Vets to fund a veterans park near Mount Rushmore in
South Dakota's Black Hills, according to the indictment.
   The defendants allegedly told investors that 70 acres had been
donated for the park and that groundbreaking would take place on
Memorial Day 1987, according to the indictment. The government
claims that no land was donated or bought for the park and no park
had been built.
   Yeager, a retired Air Force general and the first pilot to break
the sound barrier, withdrew from the project after a short time,
Ericksen said.
   ``It sounds like a really good idea,'' she said. ``You sell
these medallions, build a park in South Dakota, honor these
veterans _ I can see why his agent would be interested in this.''
   ``Obviously, shortly after he got involved with these folks he
figured out what was up and he withdrew his support,'' she said. He
got involved because ``he was simply lied to,'' she said.
   A woman answering the telephone in Yeager's office in Grass
Valley, Calif., said he was out of town and not available for
comment.
   A telephone call to the Can-Am Mint and Trading Ltd. office was
answered by a recording saying the number had been temporarily
disconnected at the customer's request. A call placed to the number
given for Vets for Vets did not go through.
   ``It looked legitimate,'' said Pete Ellingson of Inver Grove
Heights, who said he agreed to buy 10 medallions at more than $80
each after doing some videotape editing and duplicating for one of
the defendants' companies.
   ``Their offices had the fanciest of furniture, the biggest of
layouts,'' he said. ``They kept calling me back and saying, `Pete,
you're going to miss the market. ... These things are really
soaring.'''
   Charged with numerous mail fraud counts are Michael J. Crosby,
39, who is in custody in California on unrelated fraud charges;
James A. Sannes, 43, of St. Paul; Jack P. Cunningham, 52, of
Burnsville; Tamara M. Kesler, 24, of Burnsville; Dale V. Peterson,
39, of Stacy; Martin L. Cheatham, 40, formerly of St. Paul; and
Phillip P. Krzyzaniak, of Irvine, Calif.
   The indictment says Crosby was the president of Can-Am, Kesler
was the company's director of administration and Sannes was
president of Vets for Vets.
   Kesler, Cunningham and Peterson appeared last Friday before a
federal magistrate and were freed after each posting 5 percent of
$50,000 bail. Ericksen said she will ask that Crosby be transferred
from California to Minnesota.
   The three remaining defendants were not in custody as of Monday,
according to federal officials.

<HEAD>Gulf Convoy Turns Back, Apparently Due to Bad Weather</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A convoy of U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers
moved into the Persian Gulf on Tuesday for the first time since
last week's clash with Iran, but the vessels turned back,
reportedly because of bad weather.
   One source, an official close to the Kuwait Oil Tanker Co. which
owns the tankers, said another attempt to move the ships might come
within 24 hours.
   Shipping executives said a sandstorm reduced visibility in the
central gulf to less than two miles, thereby limiting the ability
of mine-hunting helicopters and Navy vessels to detect mines.
   They said that although two ``mine danger areas'' had been
cleared by American and other mine sweepers in recent days, there
still was too much risk in sending ships into the area without
adequate mine-hunting protection.
   A spokesman for the U.S. Central Command said he could provide
no information on any convoy activity. The United States
customarily does not confirm the movements until they have passed
specific danger points in the gulf.
   U.S. officials, speaking privately, earlier had conceded there
was growing concern over the freeze in convoy movements that
followed the mining of a U.S. navy frigate and the subsequent
U.S.-Iran skirmishes.
   The 3,700-ton guided missile frigate Samuel B. Roberts ran into
a mine on April 14. Ten crewmen were injured in the blast.
   The United States retaliated four days later with a series of
attacks on Iranian targets in the gulf. During the day, the U.S.
Navy sank or damaged six Iranian naval craft.
   After the Roberts incident, more than a dozen mines were found
and destroyed by U.S., British, Dutch, Belgian and Italian mine
hunters in that area. French warships destroyed mines in another
area 70 miles away.
   U.S. officials said they still were trying to identify the type
of missiles fired at the U.S. warships during the April 18 battles.
Officers aboard the ships identified them as Chinese-made
Silkworms, but military officials in Washington said that had not
been confirmed.
   British and French convoys were reported to have passed through
the ``mine danger area,'' but the source close to the Kuwaiti oil
firm said the Kuwaiti convoys would not move until U.S. and Kuwaiti
officials were satisfied that the mine and missile threat was under
control.
   The 11 Kuwaiti tankers, reflagged by the United States last year
for protection from Iranian attack, operate on a fairly tight
schedule in delivering petroleum cargoes to Kuwait's long-term
contract customers, mainly in Japan and Europe.
   A two-tanker convoy that had been scheduled to enter the gulf
April 15 was canceled, and four more ships arrived within days at
the convoy staging area off the United Arab Emirates port of Khor
Fakkan.
   One U.S. offcer called it an ``unprecedented traffic jam.''
   U.S. officials in Washington had denied last week that the
escort operations had been suspended.
   The ships at Khor Fakkan included the 401,283-ton supertanker
Bridgeton, which had been slated to make one of its infrequent
trips into the gulf since it was hit by a mine on the first convoy
last July 24.
   The others were the 46,723-ton Gas Queen, scheduled to move with
the Bridgeton, and the oil products carriers Townsend, 294,739
tons, the 81,283-ton Sea Isle City and the Chesapeake City and
Ocean City, both 79,999 tons.
   A seventh tanker, the 46,723-ton liquefied gas carrier Gas King,
was stranded at Kuwait, awaiting clearance to sail south.

   Cold, wet weather has slowed spring planting
and crop development in a large part of the nation's farmbelt, the
government's Joint Agricultural Weather Facility said Tuesday.
   ``Precipitation slowed planting in the central and southern
Great Plains, Delta and Southeast,'' the facility reported. ``The
cold weather slowed wheat growth in the northern and central Great
Plains and Corn Belt.''
   Dry conditions continued to hamper winter wheat growth in the
northern Plains, while disease and insects were the main problems
in central areas.
   The facility, which is operated by the Agriculture and Commerce
departments, said corn planting was about 15 percent completed in
the major producing states by April 24, ahead of the 11 percent
pace of a year ago and the long-term average progress of 9 percent
by this time.
   ``Planting was under way in all states except Michigan and South
Dakota,'' the report said. ``Seeding surpassed the average in
nearly all states, (although) below-normal and sometimes freezing
temperatures slowed planting in some Corn Belt states.

<HEAD>Benefit Increases Double Over Past Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pay raises are continuing to grow rather than
diminish for the first time this decade, with benefit increases
doubling in size overall in the past year and tripling for
blue-collar workers, the government said Tuesday.
   Wage and benefit increases for the 12 months ending in March
averaged 4.1 percent, compared with 3.4 percent during the previous
12 months, the Labor Department said.
   Over-the-year gains of 3.5 percent in basic wage rates for
non-union workers in private industry exceeded those of union
members at 2.6 percent, continuing a trend that has dominated most
of the decade, the department said.
   But when benefits are included, that gap narrowed considerably:
a 4 percent total compensation gain for non-union workers versus
3.9 percent for those who belong to unions.
   And in the rebounding manufacturing sector, union members with
combined wage and benefit gains averaging 5.5 percent outpaced
non-union workers with an average increase of 4.2 percent, the
Bureau of Labor Statistics said.
   The government data reflects what analysts and labor negotiators
for both businesses and unions have been seeing as a growing demand
for more untaxed benefits rather than taxable wage increases
despite nominally lower tax rates.
   Just last month, officials of the Teamsters union were told by
180,000 members to take back a contract just negotiated with the
trucking industry and swap some of the pay increase for bigger
employer contributions to health and pension plans.
   Benefit increases in the past 12 months have averaged 5.8
percent overall in private industry, double the 2.9 percent rate
during the previous 12 months, the Labor Department's statisticians
said Tuesday.
   And among blue-collar workers, benefit cost increases to
employers have nearly tripled _ from a 2.3 percent gain a year ago
to 6.8 percent that past 12 months. In manufacturing, the average
benefit increase the past 12 months was 7 percent, compared with
just 1.5 percent a year ealier.
   The government said the bulk of the accelerating benefit
increase is represented by escalating health insurance costs with a
smaller portion coming from increased Social Security contributions
by employers.
   ``Some of these benefits have turned into entitlements, and just
like the government, a lot of businesses have lost control of
them,'' said Richard Belous, an labor economist for The Conference
Board, a business research group.
   ``For a while, it looked like many employers were containing
health care costs but in the last year a lot of the solutions such
as increased outpatient care and requiring second opinions before
surgery have unraveled,'' he said. ``With mandatory health
insurance on the horizon, a lot of companies are going to have to
go back to the drawing board.''
   However, John Zalusky, an economist for the AFL-CIO, said much
of the difference in the benefit increases between union and
non-union workers can be explained by the stock market crash last
October.
   ``Union employers tend to have defined benefit pension plans,
which means that when the market crashed, they had to put more
money into the kitty,'' he said. ``Non-union employers have
switched more to defined contribution plans in which the
beneficiaries absorbed the brunt of the crash.''
   Zalusky agreed that unions are emphasizing non-pay items more at
the bargaining table, such as profit-sharing, bonus and employee
stock ownership plans that don't show up in the government's
collective bargaining or employment cost figures.
   ``The worker retraining programs negotiated with Ford, General
Motors and AT&T now constitute the largest privately endowed
education program in the country,'' he said, ``and they are nowhere
reflected in the data.''
   In a separate report, the Labor Department said first-year pay
increases in major union contracts negotiated the first three
months of 1988 averaged only 2.1 percent, excluding cost-of-living
adjustments (COLA) and lump-sum bonuses.
   However, excluding the 20 percent who agreed to wage freezes _
often in exchange for profit-sharing, stock ownership or bonus
arrangements _ the average increase under the new contracts was 2.7
percent, the department said.
   Including the COLA payments and lump-sum or profit-sharing
bonuses from other, older contracts, the average effective wage
increase over the past 12 months under collective bargaining
agreements has been 3.8 percent, the government said.
   That compares favorably with both the 2.4 percent effective wage
increase a year earlier for union members and the 3.5 percent gain
the past 12 months for non-union workers.
   Earlier government data showed that union workers last year
maintained a roughly 36 percent wage advantage over non-union
workers _ $465 a week vs. $342 in 1987.

   A collection of the personal scrapbooks, tape
recordings, published and unpublished sheet music of Edward Kennedy
``Duke'' Ellington was presented to the Smithsonian Institution on
Tuesday by the son of the late composer-orchestra leader.
   ``We've come to perpetuate Ellington as a composer,'' Mercer
Ellington said. ``Personally, it gives me the satisfaction of
knowing we have located Ellington in a place of posterity.
   ``We will come to see him take his place among the other great
composers of note, such as Debussy,'' Ellington said. ``There is
also the fact that a black American was able to achieve this
without having to go anyplace else. He got it at home.''
   Acquisition of the 6,000-item collection followed three years of
negotiations with the Ellington estate and a special congressional
appropriation of $500,000, said Roger G. Kennedy, director of the
Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. The collection
will be housed in the jazz section of the museum's division of
musical history.
   He said about half the funds would be used to preserve the older
manuscripts, some still stored in brown cardboard boxes.
   The Smithsonian also plans to sponser performances of
Ellington's previously unknown works and issue an unspecified
number of publications featuring articles from the collection.
   ``We have produced many good songwriters in this country,'' said
Martin Williams, cultural historian of the Smithsonian Institution
Press. ``But he was much more than that _ he was a
composer-orchestrator.
   ``It is on those accomplishments that he receives the respect
that he has ... as a major figure in 20th century music,'' Williams
said.
   The author of several Smithsonian jazz books, Williams said the
collection offers ``Ellingtonologists'' the opportunity to examine
the original sheet music of the Duke's classics, including ``Satin
Doll,'' ``Mood Indigo'' and ``Caravan.'' All other sheet music of
Ellington's works had been transcribed from old recordings and
tapes, he said.
   ``To Pop the best song was the one he was writing at the time,''
Ellington said, noting that his father had written some rock 'n'
roll songs from his rhythm and blues times.
   Ellington also told of the time when his father put together a
be-bop group called The Spacemen. ``He never excluded himself from
any generation.''

   PLO leader Yasser Arafat left Syria on
Tuesday after agreeing with President Hafez Assad to work for a
strategic alliance against Israel and a U.S. Middle East peace plan.
   Arafat met with Assad on Monday to try to end a five-year feud
between two of the Arab world's most influential figures.
   Farouk Kaddoumi, head of the Palestine Liberation Organization's
political department, said Arafat would return to Damascus soon,
after ``the foundations for a common action'' had been laid in the
3{-hourt meeting with Assad.
   Kaddoumi also said that a summit meeting grouping Assad, Arafat,
Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid and Libyan leader Col. Moammar
Gadhafi probably would be held next month in either the Libyan or
Algerian capital.
   Arafat also met for one hour Tuesday with Vice President
Abdul-Halim Khaddam before leaving for Libya aboard a special
plane. He later told reporters his talks in Damascus were ``useful
and will have positive results on the Palestinian and Arab levels.''
   Arafat arrived in Syria on Sunday and visited the grave of
Khalil Wazir, Arafat's deputy who was gunned down April 16.
   The PLO chief was accompanied on Tuesday's flight to Libya by
Salah Khalaf, better known as Abu Iyad, his No. 2 man in Fatah, the
PLO's mainstream faction and Arafat's power base.
   Arafat left Kaddoumi and other aides behind to work out the
details of a new Syrian-PLO alliance.
   In an interview after Arafat's departure, Kaddoumi said Syria
and the PLO ``have agreed to work together in a joint struggle
against Israel and U.S. (Middle East peace) plans.''
   That was a reference to a peace plan presented by U.S. Secretary
of State George P. Shultz last March. Under the peace plan,
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip would be granted
limited self-rule.
   Palestinians in those territories have been rioting against the
Israeli occupation since Dec. 8.
   Both Syria and the PLO rejected the plan and insist on settling
the Middle East problem through an international peace conference
that would lead to the creation of a Palestinian state.
   Kaddoumi said there was ``complete harmony'' in the stands of
the PLO and Syria on this issue.
   He said ``the uprising in the occupied West Bank is our (Syrian
and PLO) first concern. We agree that all our efforts should focus
on bolstering the uprising and rallying support for it.''
   Kaddoumi, the PLO's chief diplomat, said Syria and the PLO have
worked out details of their new alliance before an extraordinary
Arab summit meeting tentatively set for early June in Algiers.
   He said both leaders hope they will go to the summit ``with
identical views on all issues, if not a common working paper.''
   Rafik al-Natsheh, another Fatah central committee member who
attended the talks in Damascus, said Syria and the PLO had solved
most of their problems.

   Your bank cash machine has gone berserk, giving
out $20 bills as if they were fivers, yet your receipt shows no
sign of overpayment.
   Do you:
   a.) Use the emergency telephone to alert the bank.
   b.) Take the money and run.
   c.) Call your friends to get down there, too.
   If you chose the first option, you are a rare breed of cat,
judging from an unintentional ethics experiment staged Sunday at a
Manhattan bank branch.
   Because some hapless employee loaded a canister of $20 bills
into the slot for $5 bills, the First Federal Savings and Loan
Association of Rochester's branch at First Avenue and 14th Street
launched an accidental exercise in income redistribution.
   Although the cash machine panel has a 24-hour telephone for
reporting problems outside bank hours, the response was not
overwhelming _ ``one or two calls,'' according to bank spokesman
Robert Nolan.
   Instead, a line of eager card holders quickly formed at the
machine.
   ``I called everybody I knew,'' a writer, who asked not to be
identified for fear of prosecution, told New York Newsday.
   An actor named Chris, who asked for $40 and received $160, was
amused by the range of reactions: ``One person let out a holler of
joy. Another barely raised his eyebrows and sneaked out. One woman
went into a tirade about how she's getting back at the bank for
money it owed her.''
   Nor did guilt apparently set in later. The bank received only
one call on Monday reporting Sunday's malfunction. ``I was really
surprised the gentleman called,'' admitted Amelia Saavedra, the
branch manager.
   The most a customer could ask for was $200 _ and get $800. Nolan
said that although the bank's audit was not finished, it appeared
the automated teller overpaid a total ``somewhat less than $5,000.''
   Nolan said the bank was not dismayed by its customers' eagerness
to profit from the foul-up. ``I wouldn't want to characterize them
all,'' he said of the customers. ``I think some individuals were
innocent recipients of the machine.''
   He said First Federal would learn the identities of those who
reaped windfalls, once it determined how much was lost and who was
making withdrawals during the time the machine was in the giving
mood.
   ``We'll be able to determine who requested what, and what they
really got,''' Nolan said, adding that customer accounts would be
automatically charged for the amount overpaid.
   The Manhattan district attorney's office said bank customers
might be subject to prosecution for larceny. But it was unclear
whether the bank would be able to prove that all the bills in the
$5 slot were really $20s.
   Bank cash machines in the city typically hold about $100,000,
according to banking industry experts. Overpayments like Sunday's
are said to be extremely rare.
   ``It's much more common for the reverse to happen _ a customer
is shortchanged,'' said John Love of Bank Network News, an industry
newsletter. ``But we estimate these kinds of problems only occur in
about one-twentieth of 1 percent of all (automated teller)
transactions.''

<HEAD>Soviets Leave Mobile Without Sister-City Certificate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOBILE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet delegation that came to Mobile
seeking a sister-city bond departed in frustration Tuesday after
their weeklong visit to the port city turned diplomatically chilly.
   Jay Higginbotham, who spearheaded the sister-city proposal after
a trip to the Soviet Union last year, said the Soviet mayor and two
city council members from Rostov-on-Don were ``hurt and
distraught'' by their rejection.
   But the visitors enjoyed their tour of the Gulf coast, said
Higginbotham, a librarian and archivist for the city who has
written a book on his travels in the Soviet Union titled ``Fast
train Russia.''
   Mobile Mayor Arthur Outlaw said at the outset he disapproved of
the proposed sister-city agreement and the proposal never received
a City Council vote. Thus, the proposal died without official
consideration Tuesday.
   ``I don't see what can be gained by relations between an
appointed government and an elected government that responds to the
will of the people,'' Outlaw said while attending a welcome
reception for the group last week.
   The visitors included Alexander Balashov, Mikhail Tupchenko,
Gennadi Zorenko, and translator Svetlana Khokhlova.
   In Washington, Quentin Crommelin Jr., the chief Republican
counsel of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said
members of the Rostov group were likely Soviet agents.
   ``It is well known to be standard operating procedure for all
Soviet delegations, of whatever type, to have at least one-third
KGB or GRU agents as members, both to prevent defection and to
gather intelligence,'' Crommelin told The Mobile Register.
   He also suggested that the sister-city link could be proposed to
gather military intelligence on the proposed Navy base at Mobile
and nearby Ingalls Shipyard at Pascagoula, Miss.
   ``That sounds absurd,'' Higginbotham said Tuesday.
   Higgenbotham was a member of a group of residents from Mobile
that visited the Soviet city last year and arranged for the
exchange. He said the Rostov officials ``came over trying to make a
good impression.''
   Higginbotham said Gov. Guy Hunt had declared the visitors
honorary citizens of Alabama. But he said they left thinking
something they had said or wore provoked the rejection by Mobile
officials.
   ``It was a little pitiful,'' Higginbotham said.

   ``Fatal Attraction'' star Glenn Close gave
birth Tuesday to a girl, her first child, and a spokeswoman for the
actress said both were doing fine in an East Coast hospital.
   The 7-pound, 12-ounce baby, which hadn't been named, was born at
10:58 a.m. EDT. The hospital wasn't identified because ``she is
desperate for privacy,'' publicist Catherine Olim said from her New
York office.
   ``Mother and child are doing fine,'' Ms. Olim said, adding there
were no problems. No details were disclosed.
   Producer John Starke, 37, the baby's father, and Miss Close, 41,
aren't married.
   The actress is scheduled to start shooting the movie adaptation
of the French novel ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses'' in June, Ms. Olim
said.

<HEAD>Demjanjuk Upbeat, Family Says; Israel Orders Suicide Watch</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An upbeat John Demjanjuk met with his family
for two hours Tuesday and was optimistic that his conviction and
death sentence on Nazi war crimes would be overturned, relatives
said.
   But an official at the prison where he is being held said guards
were ordered to put the retired Ohio autoworker under suicide
surveillance.
   Demjanjuk, 68, was returned to solitary confinement in the
maximum-security Ayalon Prison on Monday after being sentenced to
death for executing hundreds of thousands of Jews as the brutal
Nazi guard ``Ivan the Terrible.''
   Demjanjuk, who insisted he was innocent throughout the 14-month
trial, plans to appeal to Israel's Supreme Court.
   Israel prison service spokesman Johnny Tester said Demjanjuk was
placed ``under 24-hour guard, and we are asking his guards to be
more careful, more alert. We want to be prepared in case of a
suicide attempt.''
   Demjanjuk's son, John Demjanjuk Jr., said the precautions were
``a bunch of baloney.''
   ``They're going to pop up with that kind of stupid propaganda to
try to make it seem like he might kill himself out of remorse or
guilt,'' John Demjanjuk Jr., 22, told The Associated Press.
   ``My father would never attempt something like that because he's
innocent and he'll fight this to the last minute,'' the younger
Demjanjuk said.
   Demjanjuk's daughter Lydia Maday, 38, said her father was
cheerful Tuesday during the family's first meeting since he was
sentenced to die.
   ``We definitely get our strength from him. You keep thinking
when you go in there you're going to have to pump him up and it's
just the opposite,'' Mrs. Maday said. ``He's prepared to move on
and get ready for the appeal.''
   She said Demjanjuk, who was extradited to Israel from his
suburban Cleveland home, told the family he bore no animosity
toward the Israeli judges or the 650 spectators who clapped and
chanted ``Death! Death!'' when the sentence was announced.
   ``He's not vindictive. There's no hate,'' Mrs. Maday said. ``He
just said it's a shame that people have to rejoice in someone
else's sorrow. You just have to overlook it. A lot of people didn't
feel that way.''
   Mrs. Maday said Demjanjuk, a devout Ukrainian Orthodox
Christian, cited passages from the Bible and said ``Christ was spat
upon and villified and yet he turned the other cheek. My dad says
he's another innocent victim and he can take it too.''
   John Demjanjuk Jr. said the defense would not file an appeal for
several weeks, until after the family returns home to map a
strategy.
   Demjanjuk was convicted April 18 of being the sadistic guard who
helped operate the gas chambers at the Treblinka death camp in
Nazi-occupied Poland, where 850,000 Jews were killed.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who lost relatives in the
Holocaust, praised the sentence.
   ``All of us are proud that a Jewish tribunal in the Jewish state
has judged and condemned one of the cruelest war criminals who
murdered many of our Jewish brethren and relatives,'' the
Polish-born Shamir said.
   Some Israelis saw the 14-month trial as a crucial opportunity to
educate the younger generation and remind the world of the horrors
of the Holocaust.
   ``The personal fate of John Demjanjuk isn't important or very
interesting,'' Yosef Lapid, an Israeli commentator and Holocaust
survivor, said on Israel radio. ``The importance of the trial was
to remind us of the Holocaust. For most of humanity the Holocaust
is cloudy history.''

   Jesse Jackson, seeking to spotlight southern
Africa in the presidential campaign, went to the State Department
Tuesday to discuss Mozambican rebel atrocities and to say South
Africa should be treated as a terrorist state.
   Jackson pointed to a new report by a State Department consultant
that said the rebels in Mozambique have killed 100,000 civilians
and engaged in systematic murder, beating, mutilation, rape,
looting, burnings and abductions.
   The Democratic presidential contender said South African support
for the rebels amounts to ``state-sponsored terrorism'' and the
United States should provide security to South Africa's neighbors.
   He met with top State Department officials, including Deputy
Secretary of State John Whitehead, for a briefing on the report,
which was compiled by a department consultant, Robert Gersony.
   Chester Crocker, assistant secretary of state for African
affairs, joined Jackson at a news conference afterward.
   Crocker said there is ``a pattern of continuing contact between
South Africa and Renamo,'' the rebel group, and he said South
Africa's involvement goes against a 1984 treaty it entered with
Mozambique.
   South Africa denies having supported the rebels since that time.
   Jackson used the Gersony report to underscore his call for a
change in U.S. policy toward South Africa and the ``frontline
states'' around it.
   He called on Democratic rival Michael Dukakis and Republican
George Bush to join him in calling South Africa a terrorist state.
   Jackson said Congress should pass legislation ``clarifying its
meaning of state-sponsored terrorism to specifically include South
Africa.''
   He also called for an increase in humanitarian aid to the
frontline states and for a congressional delegation to visit
Mozambique on a fact-finding mission.
   Jackson has repeatedly tried to make South Africa and the
frontline states a campaign issue, but other candidates have not
focused on it. He met Tuesday morning with some members of Congress
and frontline states' ambassadors to discuss the issue.
   Some conservative members of Congress have called for U.S. aid
to Renamo, which is trying to bring down Mozambique's Marxist-led
government, but the United States officially supports the
government.

<HEAD>Poison-Laced Grapefruit Spurs Nationwide Seizure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health officials on Tuesday began seizing all
grapefruit on sale in Italy after some pieces of fruit believed
imported from Israel were found laced with a powerful poison.
   The Health Ministry ordered the nationwide seizure of all
grapefruit on sale and and in warehouses after health officials in
the Lazio region, which includes Rome, reported that poisoned
grapefruit was found in a Rome supermarket.
   Italian news media said the grapefruit apparently was imported
from Israel, but officials said they could not immediately confirm
where the fruit originated.
   Last week, an organization that said it supported the
Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip claimed to have poisoned Israeli grapefruit on sale in Milan.
It called for a boycott of Israeli products.
   Laboratory checks at the time found no trace of poison.
   The claim was made by a caller to a Rome newspaper who said he
was speaking on behalf of the ``Organization of Metropolitan
Proletarians and Oppressed People,'' a group that was not known to
have existed.
   Of the 12 grapefruit on sale at the Rome supermarket, six were
found to have been injected by syringe with a bluish poison. The
substance, which was not identified, was so powerful that it killed
laboratory mice instantly.
   The University of Rome's poison center reported receiving calls
from three Rome residents who said they had eaten grapefruit with
blue marks on Monday or Tuesday.
   ``So far none of them has reported any ill effects,'' said
Professor Enrico Malizia, head of the department.
   Israeli-grown ``Jaffa'' grapefruit in cellophane wrappers is
sold widely in Italy.
   Israeli Embassy spokesman Avi Granot promised to cooperate with
Italian authorities to determine whether the grapefruit poisoning
was ``an isolated case, a gesture of a madman or a terrorist act.''
   ``It is certainly a criminal act,'' he said.
   Granot said an expert from Israel's Agriculture Ministry was on
his way to Rome to help in the investigations.
   The Italian news agency ANSA said there was at least one
precedent for the poisoning. It reported that oranges and
grapefruits from Israel were poisoned with mercury in several
Western European nations in 1978. There was no claim of
responsibility.
   The news agency reported that Italy imports about 23,000 tons of
grapefruit from Israel annually.
   The figure represents about half of Italy's total import of
grapefruit. In 1987, grapefruit imports from Israel were valued at
an estimated $13.2 million.
   Owners of the Rome supermarket where the poisoned grapefruit was
found said they had sold about 36 Jaffa grapefruit the day before
the contaminated ones were taken for testing on April 20.
   Supermarket clients said two or three youths were distributing
pamphlets near the store last week urging customers to boycott
Israeli goods, ANSA reported. They said a poster affixed on a wall
outside the supermarket said, ``Don't buy Jaffa grapefruit. Boycott
Israel.''

<TEXT>
   Troops on Tuesday fought military
deserters who have formed a religious cult on a small island, and
seven people were killed, the military said.
   After the battle, dozens of former elite Scout Rangers remained
holed up with about 600 civilians in a standoff on Mactan Island
about 300 miles south of Manila. A renegade leader said he needed
more time to convince his men to surrender, according to a mayor
involved in the negotiations.
   Four government troops and three deserters were killed in
Tuesday's predawn clash. Local radio stations said one civilian
also died.
   The fight broke out when deserters, who took refuge on the
island in 1986 and formed their religious cult, attacked a military
checkpoint set up to prevent them from leaving their hideout,
military officials said.
   Maxim Patalinhug, mayor of nearby Lapu-Lapu City, met with the
leader of the renegades to tell him to give up. Sgt. Jose Sabandeja
promised to ask his men to surrender but said he needed more time,
the mayor said.
   About 600 civilians were staying with the deserters, maintaining
they were willing to die with them, the mayor said.
   Brig. Gen. Jesus Hermosa, regional military commander, said he
called off a planned attack on the deserters Tuesday to allow
officials more time to negotiate.
   ``The outlaws have many conditions which are not acceptable,''
Hermosa said. ``Their surrender would be unconditional. They should
face the consequences.''
   He said military operations would resume Wednesday. Hermosa has
vowed to capture the 30 to 50 renegades, who moved to Mactan after
deserting their unit on Mindanao island.
   The military claims the renegades have been involved in
smuggling.
   Also on Tuesday, suspected communist rebels gunned down a police
captain and an anti-communist vigilante in two separate attacks
outside the U.S.-run Clark Air Base 50 miles northwest of Manila,
officials said.
   Police said two men armed with .45-caliber pistols shot and
killed Capt. Francisco Medina, deputy police commander of Mabalacat
town, as he drove late Monday near the sprawling military base.
   Hours later, a lone gunman killed Francisco Sabile, a member of
a vigilante group, while he played cards with friends in
neighboring Angeles City, officials said.
   The military also said 17 communist rebels were killed when
government troops stormed a hideout in the northern province of
Kalinga-Apayao on Saturday.

<HEAD>NATO Defense Chiefs to Meet on Nuclear Arms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT J. WIELAARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO defense ministers open a two-day
conference Wednesday to keep their policies in line with superpower
efforts to cut nuclear weapons.
   The meeting comes amid internal strains between much of the
Western military alliance and Denmark, which has moved to
strengthen its longstanding ban on peacetime nuclear weapons. This
week's talks were originally supposed to take place in Denmark, but
they were moved to NATO headquarters in Brussels in reaction to the
Danish initiative.
   In addition, the ministers will grapple with West German fears
about NATO's plan to modernize short-range nuclear arms. The
Germans think such a move could make them a more likely target for
Soviet aggression.
   However, this week's NATO meeting is not likely to yield major
decisions, alliance officials say. It is instead intended to review
long-range nuclear arms planning.
   It will be the first defense ministers' session since the Dec. 8
signing of the U.S.-Soviet accord to eliminate two classes of
ground-launched medium- and shorter-range nuclear missiles. The
U.S. Senate is reviewing the treaty.
   U.S. Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci was expected to brief
ministers at the meeting on preparations in the United States and
the Soviet Union for an elaborate, 13-year inspection system to
check compliance with the treaty.
   However, ministers will likely discuss the whole range of arms
control negotiations, said a NATO official who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   That would include reviewing superpower efforts to sign another
accord to cut their strategic nuclear arms by 50 percent, or 6,000
on each side. Hopes have faded of completing such a treaty by May
29 when President Reagan meets Mikhail Gorbachev in Moscow.
   The defense ministers will review their long-term nuclear arms
planning in light of the goals NATO has set for itself in recent
years, said allied officials.
   NATO has 4,600 nuclear warheads in Europe, down 2,400 since
1983. The stockpile is at its lowest in 20 years, said one NATO
official.
   The alliance is studying adjustments to its nuclear deterrent
through modernization and redeployment of arms without raising the
total number of warheads. The studies deal with developing a new
short-range Lance ground-to-ground missile, a battlefield
air-to-ground missile, and improved nuclear artillery shells.
   The issue of modernizing short-range nuclear arms, most of which
are based in West Germany, has also caused internal NATO friction.
Bonn fears that as medium-range missiles disappear under the
intermediate-range treaty, improved short-range arms would make its
soil a greater target for Soviet attack.
   It prefers short-range nuclear arms talks in tandem with
conventional talks, due to start in Vienna this fall. But its
allies say the short-range arms must still be modernized by the
mid-1990s.
   Ministers will also probably discuss Denmark's proposal to
notify individual warships of its longstanding ban on nuclear
weapons.
   NATO ministers have warned that such a move could threaten
Danish participation in the alliance.
   The Danes will vote on a new parliament May 10 in what Prime
Minister Poul Schlueter has called a referendum on NATO.

<HEAD>Arizona Governor Says She'll Amend Disclosure Forms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY LOPEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Rose Mofford, who gained office after
former Gov. Evan Mecham was accused of misdeeds that included
failure to disclose a campaign loan, has acknowledged that she did
not report some land, loans and partnerships of her own.
   ``I still question whether the law requires that these items be
disclosed,'' said Mrs. Mofford, who as secretary of state for 10
years was charged with accepting state officials' financial
disclosure statements.
   ``But I wish to avoid even the appearance of impropriety,'' she
said, promising to file amended statements. ``Arizona has been
through enough without additional doubts and nitpicking.''
   Mrs. Mofford, a Democrat, was elevated to the governor's office
from secretary of state April 4 after the Senate convicted Mecham,
a Republican, on two impeachment counts. The Senate did not vote on
a charge that he failed to disclose a $350,000 campaign loan, an
issue on which he is to stand trial May 19.
   Attorney General Bob Corbin has said he believes such items as
land, loans and partnerships are reportable, and an aide said Mrs.
Mofford's filings would be reviewed by his office.
   Mecham said that if Mrs. Mofford is allowed to get off the hook
by amending her statements, he should be treated the same way.
   Mecham laughed Monday and said ``I love it'' when he heard Mrs.
Mofford's statement about ``doubts and nitpickings.''
   Lawmakers said they would prefer to leave matters in the
attorney general's hands for now, but some left open the
possibility of another legislative investigation like the one that
led to Mecham's impeachment.
   ``We'll just have to wait until the A.G. says,'' House Speaker
Joe Lane, who initiated the Mecham investigation in the House, said
Monday. ``I just hope she gets everything fixed up.''
   The existence of the land holdings, loans and partnerships was
discovered by The Associated Press through interviews and records
in the Maricopa County Recorder's office, the state Corporation
Commission and the secretary of state's partnerships office.
   Mrs. Mofford, who divorced her husband T.R. Mofford in 1967 but
remained on good terms with him until his death in 1982, said she
undertook most of the ventures on behalf of him or his estate and
therefore felt no need to report them. Others were of such a minor
nature that she felt they did not need to be reported either, she
said.
   ``I'm not trying to hide anything. Everything's on my income
taxes,'' she said, adding that the ventures on her former husband's
behalf did not result in any financial profit to herself.
   Mrs. Mofford said she would ask Corbin to determine if the items
should have been included on her disclosure forms ``so that his
advice can be available to her and to other public officials faced
with questions,'' her office said Monday in a written statement.
   Corbin was out of town Tuesday, but chief assistant Attorney
General Steve Twist had said Monday that Corbin's office planned to
review records of the transactions.
   ``Under the circumstances now, it would not be appropriate or us
to give any personal advice to the governor,'' Twist added.
   State law requires officeholders to list any source of
compensation totaling more than $1,000 in a single year and any
title to or beneficial interest in Arizona real estate other than
the officeholder's primary residence or primarily recreational
property.
   It also requires disclosure of any business, partnership or
joint venture in which the officeholder is involved, and debt of
more than $1,000 owed by or to the officeholder and any gift above
$500.
   It is a misdemeanor to file an incomplete or false financial
disclosure statement and a felony to swear intentionally to a false
statement.
   The statements are filed with the secretary of state's office.
   Two instances Mrs. Mofford has not listed in any of her yearly
reports involved land acquisition in 1978. In one, the Moffords and
Robert Foudy bought a one-third interest each in land from Beryl
Merritt. The land was sold about 18 months later, and the Moffords
and Foudy held a $25,000 note.
   T.R. Mofford and Foudy had died by the time the buyers fell
behind in payments, and in 1986 Mrs. Mofford and Foudy's son,
Michael, filed suit. An out-of-court settlement paid them more than
$21,000 in a lump sum, Michael Foudy said in an interview.
   In the other 1978 transaction, the Moffords and Foudy acquired
individual interests in land from Pablo and Guadalupe Aguilar.
Mofford turned his share over to Mrs. Mofford and Foudy turned his
share over to his son.
   Records also indicate that n50 percent
participation with him in a $20,000 loan in 1983 and her 26-plus
percent paticipation with him and others in a $45,000 loan in 1984.
   Also unreported was Mrs. Mofford's participation as a limited
partner in Tempe-Motorola Properties and West Broadway Properties.
   In addition, the size of other land and partnership holdings is
under-reported, and there are apparent discrepancies in acquisition
dates.

   The government will put new visa procedures into
place to make it faster and easier for foreign entrepreneurs,
scientists and technicians to visit the Soviet Union, an official
said Tuesday.
   The streamlined rules beginning Sunday are part of broader
reform of Soviet economic and foreign policy, Oleg V. Avramenko,
first deputy chief of the Foreign Ministry's consular directorate,
told a news briefing.
   ``The new procedure for entry into this country reflects the
logic of the course of Soviet foreign policy, which is oriented
toward active development of economic, scientific and technical
contacts with Western and developing countries,'' he said.
   Under leader Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviets have been wooing
foreign investors, proposing joint projects with firms abroad and
seeking to use Western capital and expertise to revitalize the
state-run economy.
   For years, securing an entry visa to the Soviet Union has been a
time-consuming affair, with delays that often stretched into months.
   Starting Sunday, however, it will be the practice of Soviet
consulates abroad to issue visas within 48 hours to foreign
business people, technicians and scientists who already have
established contacts with the Soviet Union, Avramenko said.
   He said foreigners would need an invitation from a Soviet firm
or governmental agency in order to receive quickest
attention.However, others who desire to explore economic or
professional opportunities may still gain a visa at Soviet
consulates within about five days, Avramenko said.
   There will also be a ``maximum broadening'' of the granting of
multiple entry visas, documents valid for two or three years that
allow bearers to enter and leave the Soviet Union as often as they
want, the diplomat said.

   Political leaders eulogized Rep. Mel
Price Tuesday, saying the 22-term Democratic congressman was a
friend of the common man and a model for other leading Illinois
politicians.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, told about 1,000 mourners at
the Cathedral of St. Peter Roman Catholic Church that Price
``epitomized the best of that misused and sometimes abused
profession'' of politics.
   ``He was not fashionable, not flamboyant,'' said Wright. ``He
helped the humble, the powerless, those who have no voice. He was
their voice. He was their strength and he asked nothing for it.''
   Price, 83, who died Friday of pancreatic cancer, had planned to
retire in January at the end of his 22nd term. The East St. Louis
Democrat had served Southern Illinois' 21st District since 1944 and
was the second most senior man in the House after 24-term Rep.
Jamie Whitten, D-Mass.
   A wreath of red roses and white carnations with red, white and
blue ribbons from the U.S. House of Representatives adorned the
altar with another wreath from the Illinois congressional
delegation and American flags.
   Others attending the nearly two-hour funeral included U.S. Sen.
Paul Simon and Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, both Illinois Democrats, and
Illinois Attorney General Neil Hartigan.
   Democratic Sen. Alan Dixon, the state's senior senator, said,
``Some young men like Paul Simon and Alan Dixon copied his style
and learned from him. Not withstanding his power, he remembered his
friends back home.''
   He recalled that Price loved to tell the story of how he was in
the U.S. Army, working kitchen duty at a Virginia base, when a
general called him in to say he had been elected to Congress.
   For six hours Monday, mourners streamed through a Belleville
funeral home to pay their respects to Price's wife, Garaldine, and
their son, William.
   Gov. James R. Thompson has until Wednesday to schedule a special
election to choose Price's successor, said Bea Swartz of the
Illinois Board of Elections in Springfield. The election then must
be held within 115 days.

   The Reagan administration affirmed its
determination Tuesday to push a $460 million arms purchase by Saudi
Arabia through a reluctant Congress with the argument that
enhancing AWACS radar planes is essential to protect U.S. Navy
forces in the Persian Gulf.
   A bipartisan group of 187 House members has written Secretary of
State George P. Shultz opposing the sale of advanced U.S. equipment
in light of the Saudis' recent secret purchase of missiles from
China that could devastate Israel. In the Senate, 58 members are on
record against the deal.
   But State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said the Saudis
had given assurances the missiles would not be nuclear-armed and
had decided to sign the 1968 nuclear nonproliferation treaty.
   Under the accord, states without nuclear weapons agree not to
make or acquire them.
   ``We have not changed our view that the AWACS maintenance
package is critical to our gulf policy,'' Redman told reporters.
``The Saudi AWACS operation provides important support for the U.S.
mission in the gulf, including protection of U.S. Navy personnel
and equipment.''
   American warships are protecting U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti oil
tankers in the war between Iran and Iraq. A number of clashes with
Iran resulted above the Strait of Hormuz, through which cargoes
pass.
   The area is patrolled by U.S. radar planes, with the Saudi AWACS
_ or Airborne Warning and Control System _ aircraft confined to the
southern region, State Department officials told members of
Congress last week in a secret briefing.
   In the south, U.S. forces are under threat of Silkworm anti-ship
missiles Iran purchased from China.
   The decision to sell new equipment to the Saudis sets the stage
for a debate May 9, when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is
due to hold a hearing on the nomination of Walter Cutler to be
ambassador to Saudi Arabia.
   The missiles China sold to the Saudis are capable of carrying
nuclear or chemical warheads and have a range of about 1,600 miles.
They add to Israel's security concerns that were heightened last
year when Syria obtained missiles from the Soviet Union that also
could rocket Israeli population centers with deadly chemical
weapons.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said 186 other House members had
signed a letter he wrote urging Shultz to withdraw the proposed
sale.
   Redman said Shultz had not replied yet. But, the spokesman said,
``we expect to go forward with the formal notification in the near
term.''
   When that step is taken, the deal will go through unless both
the House and Senate vote to reject it within 30 days.
   ``The Saudis have assured us that their missiles would not be
nuclear-capable,'' Redman said. ``By adhering to the NPT (Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty), Saudi Arabia would further obligate
itself not to develop or acquire nuclear devices.''
   The spokesman said the State Department was concerned about the
proliferation of missiles throughout the Middle East and Persian
Gulf _ not just with the Saudi purchase from China.
   ``We remain fully committed to providing the necessary support
to Saudi Arabia for the continued operation of the AWACS,'' Redman
said. ``It is in the national security interest of the United
States to conclude this deal.''
   Schumer said signing the nonproliferation treaty ``is certainly
a welcome move.'' But, he said, ``it does not diminish
congressional concerns.''
   The New York congressman said ``the Chinese missiles, even
without nuclear warheads, pose a real threat to the security of the
entire region, in part because they are easily equipped with
chemical warheads.''
   He added: ``The fact that the missiles were acquired under a
cloud of deceit only heightens our concern.''
   Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia was expected to announce a break in
diplomatic relations with Iran in response to Iranian attacks on
shipping in the gulf
   According to an informed source, who requested anonymity, the
Saudi council of ministers took the decision at a meeting Monday
night.
   Saudi Arabia, like most of the Arab countries, supports Iraq in
its war with Iran.
   The United States, already protecting 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers
flying the U.S. flag, may extend the protection to neutral shipping.
   Shultz confirmed Monday at a news conference in Brussels that a
decision was under consideration. He and Redman declined to say
whether the request for broader U.S. involvement in the tanker war
had come from the Saudis.

<HEAD>Reagan Says Schools Are Improving With Return to Basics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan said Tuesday that American
schools are on the mend thanks to a restoration of discipline,
homework and basic skills, but ``we still have a long way to go.''
   At a ceremony marking the fifth anniversary of the landmark ``A
Nation At Risk'' report, Reagan said a new critique from Secretary
of Education William J. Bennett ``will help us find the way.''
   But outside the White House, several hundred teachers rallied in
Lafayette Park to protest the Reagan administration's policies and
heard Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., R-Conn., call Bennett ``the
secretary of ignorance.''
   Reagan said the school reforms pushed by his administration have
brought ``truly revolutionary'' changes to American schools.
   He said the National Commission on Excellence in Education,
whose 1983 report warned of a calamity approaching from ``a rising
tide of mediocrity'' in U.S. schools, ``helped heighten and
acclerate a wave of education reform in states and communities all
around the country.''
   He said it led many states to install career ladders and merit
pay for teachers, and many schools placed ``a new emphasis on
quality and discipline, more homework, more attention to basic
skills.''
   ``This was truly revolutionary after two decades in which money
had been the only measure of progress in education and in which
while federal spending on education went steadily up, test scores
fell steadily downward. Too many schools accepted the fashions of
the day, fashions of liberal culture that held traditional
standards in scorn,'' Reagan said.
   ``The key to what works is not money or being in a prosperous
neighborhood, but establishing a direction ... setting standards,''
the president said.
   Bennett told Reagan the bottom line of his report, ``American
Education: Making It Work,'' is that ``American education has made
some progress in the last few years. ... But we are not doing well
enough, and we are not doing well enough fast enough. We are still
at risk.''
   Earlier, Bennett told a news conference that the educational
establishment is criticizing his report because ``they want a
whitewash of the problem and they want a blank check.''
   Mary Hatwood Futrell, president of the 1.8 million-member
National Education Association, told the teachers at the protest,
``I don't want a blank check. I want him to sign it.''
   She charged Bennett was ``whitewashing what the administration
is doing by coming out with another report that basically says
they're not doing anything.''
   Weicker, a liberal Republican who has battled against Reagan
efforts to cut education spending, said, ``On the basis of the fact
that you get what you pay for, Mr. Bennett is not the secretary of
education, he's the secretary of ignorance.''
   The education budget today is $21 billion, compared with $14.8
billion seven years ago. But Weicker said Reagan has sought $19
billion in cuts in the last five years. Futrell and other speakers
said Head Start and the Chapter One remedial program reach only a
fraction of the youngsters eligible for the services.
   Futrell, standing beneath a banner reading, ``1983: A Nation at
Risk. 1988: An Administration Asleep,'' said, ``The time has come
for Secretary Bennett and President Reagan to get out of the
grandstand and into the game.''
   Two-hundred people attended the ceremony in the East Room,
including eight of the 18 members of the National Commission on
Excellence in Education.
   Commission chairman David P. Gardner, the president of the
University of California, said Bennett's report ``was timely,
helpful, tended to be constructive. I believe it could have been
written in a more positive fashion. ... I also think it was short
in terms of the role the federal government ought to be playing.''
   Gardner added, ``But I think the conclusion was correct, namely
we have a long way to go.''
   Bennett told reporters afterwards the NEA remains ``greatest
single obstacle to education reform in the country.''
   ``I am not surprised that they were picketing or demonstrating
there across the street, because they have been demonstrating
against education reform since the very beginning,'' he said. ``I
have re-evaluated my view of the NEA and each time I re-evaluate
it, it's worse.''

   Scores of workers toiled Tuesday to
rescue waterfowl from a 21,000-gallon oil spill that officials say
could leave a major wildlife area damaged for years and cost at
least $1 million to clean.
   ``Now we're looking at a dead marsh,'' said Neal Welsh, an
officer of the Audubon Society. ``Don't get your hopes up for the
next few decades.''
   The oil caused the greatest damage to a marsh area in Suisun
Bay, although a lighter slick extended about 10 miles west through
the Carquinez Strait into San Pablo Bay.
   The marsh area, 35 to 40 miles northeast of San Francisco, is
the most prized wetland of Northern California and a major stopover
along the migratory bird route that extends virtually the length of
California.
   Directed by a Coast Guard helicopter, six oil skimmers were
deployed to the worst oil slicks, and vacuum pumps worked day and
night to suck oil out of the marshes.
   The unrefined crude oil leaked from a storage tank Saturday at
Shell Oil Co.'s Martinez refinery. The company has acknowledged
responsibility for the spill.
   Shell's tab for cleanup costs could exceed $1 million, said
Larry Kolb, the Water Qaulity Control Board's regional assistant
executive. In addition, the company also is likely to face
penalties and other costs, including damage to bottoms of numerous
pleasure boats, he said.
   Under state law, Shell could face $210,000 in fines _ $10 a
gallon _ and more if the state attorney general's office files a
successful lawsuit.
   ``The cleanup could continue for days to weeks,'' said Kolb.
``The damage may be there for years.''
   State Department of Fish and Game official Brian Hunter said
about 200 soiled but living birds have been collected for
treatment, and some 75 birds have been found dead. Biologists said
the spill also threatened nests.
   The marshes are home to dozens of species of birds including
egrets, avocets, grebes, sandpipers, ducks, herons, teals and the
endangered clapper rail bird, as well as salt marsh harvest mice,
tortoises, muskrats and otters.

<HEAD>Austin Urged to Rename Bowie High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hispanic and black leaders are urging
Austin school officials to name a new high school after someone
other than Alamo hero James Bowie, arguing that Bowie was a slave
trader.
   Gary Bledsoe, president of the NAACP's Austin chapter, said
Bowie isn't the kind of person whose name should be on a school.
   ``The plain and simple truth, according to some of the most
noted Texas historians ... is that Jim Bowie smuggled slaves into
North America, sold them at vastly inflated prices, owned then,
sold fictitious land grants for Texas land, fraudulently sold land
owned by his in-laws and committed many other heinous and nefarious
acts,'' Bledsoe said.
   Black and Hispanic leaders have suggested naming the school
after a Hispanic. No Austin high school has a Hispanic namesake.
   The Daughters of the Republic of Texas and 420 other people
recommended that the school be named for Bowie. In a March vote,
the Austin Independent School District Board of Trustees approved
Bowie's name for the school with two board members dissenting. For
the matter to be reheard, a board member who voted in favor of
Bowie's name must move for reconsideration. No such motion was made
at the panel's latest meeting Monday.
   A Kentucky native, Bowie was an adventurer who by age 18 had
earned a reputation for riding alligators and wrestling bears. In
1828, he moved to Texas and settled in San Antonio. After first
sharing command at the Alamo with William B. Travis, Bowie fell ill
and died on March 6, 1836, when Mexican soldiers captured the
mission. A county and a city in Texas are named for him.
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
and others sent a letter complaining of the name choice to the
school board April 11.

   President Reagan has nominated Army Lt. Gen.
Crosbie E. Saint for promotion to general and assignment as
commander of the United States Army Europe, the Pentagon said
Tuesday.
   Assuming Senate confirmation, Saint would receive his fourth
star and replace Gen. Glenn K. Otis, who is retiring on Aug. 1
after more than 35 years of active service, the Pentagon said.
   Saint, 51, a native of West Point, N.Y., now commands the Army's
III Corps and Fort Hood, Texas. Otis, 59, of Plattsburgh, N.Y., has
held the European post since April 1983.
   Maj. Gen. Richard G. Graves will be promoted to lieutenant
general and replace Saint as commander of III Corps and Fort Hood,
the Pentagon said.
   Graves, 54, of Tangier, Ind., is assistant deputy chief of staff
for operations and plans at Army headquarters.
   Two unrelated retirements involving Army general officers also
were announced Tuesday.
   Lt. Gen. Gerald T. Bartlett, 52, will retire Aug. 1 as deputy
commanding general of the Training and Doctrine Command at Fort
Leavenworth, Kan.
   Lt. Gen. Charles W. Dyke, 52, will retire on Sept. 1 as
commender of the United States Army Japan.

   The armed forces began slashing active-duty
strength in March to accommodate budget cuts, paring almost 19,000
positions from the ranks during the month, the Pentagon said
Tuesday.
   As of March 31, the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps had
2,143,129 men and women on active duty, down 18,727 from the
2,161,856 reported Feb. 29 and 25,051 below the March 31, 1987,
total.
   All four services reported declines in personnel during March,
although the Navy's drop was relatively minor, the Pentagon said.
   The Air Force reported 594,660 personnel on active duty at the
end of March, down 8,939 from Feb. 29. The Army set its strength at
768,211 as of March 31, down 8,202 from February. And the Marine
Corps reported 197,127 on active duty, 1,104 less than in February.
   The Navy, meantime, reported a decline of 482 men and women in
March to 583,131.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci has ordered a cut of
active-duty slots to accommodate spending levels set for fiscal
1989, which begins Oct. 1. He has told Congress he would rather
maintain a smaller force that is properly equipped and ready to
fight than a larger, but ``hollow,'' force.
   As a result of that decision, the services must lower their
manpower levels to a combined 2,138,327 _ or 35,890 below the total
reported at the end of fiscal 1987 last Sept. 30.

<HEAD>Volcker Says Presidential Candidates Ignoring Economic Issues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker says
he is skeptical about some economic positions taken by the
presidential front-runners, Republican George Bush and Democrat
Michael Dukakis.
   Volcker, who served under presidents Carter and Reagan, said the
nation's economic problems are not likely to be solved by Vice
President Bush's pledge not to raise taxes or by Massachusetts Gov.
Dukakis' call to crack down on tax cheats.
   He said the nation must increase its level of savings and must
take action to cut the trade and budget deficits. And he said
spending on such programs as Social Security and Medicare must be
limited.
   Volcker said the next president must act promptly upon taking
office next year or a recession could follow.
   ``Candidates actively don't want to talk about the issue,''
Volcker said. ``And sometimes it's better when they aren't talking
about it than when they are.''
   He was in Atlanta Monday for a competitiveness conference at the
Carter Presidential Center.

<HEAD>FTC Chairman Scores Democratic Candidates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Trade Commission Chairman Daniel
Oliver offered his views of the Democratic presidential contenders
Tuesday, criticizing proposals of Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis
and scoring Democrats for not condemning a 1984 Jackson reference
to New York Jews.
   Oliver, a former executive editor of the conservative National
Review, said the central question of the current campaign is an
economic one: whether the policies of President Reagan will be
ratified or rejected.
   The candidacy of Jackson, who is black, represents an important
and moving moment in history, Oliver said in remarks prepared for a
luncheon at the Heritage Foundation.
   But Jackson's proposals would cost billions of dollars,
resulting in higher taxes and reducing employment instead of
helping the poor, Oliver said.
   In addition, he went on, there is a question of character
focusing on Jackson's reference to New York City as ``Hymietown.''
   What if a Republican contendor referred to Birmingham, Ala., as
``coontown?'' asked Oliver. ``I can't imagine the other Republican
candidates even appearing on the same television platform with
someone who said that.''
   ``How can Mr. Dukakis ask for our votes when he lacks even the
courage to condemn a man who calls Jews ``Hymies?'' asked Oliver.
And he said Dukakis was far from the only silent Democrat.
   Oliver also said the governor was not responsible for the
economic upturn in Massachusetts in recent years. That improvement
should be attributed to tax cuts instigated by Reagan and former
Gov. Ed King, said Oliver.
   ``Mr. Dukakis may fool some people into thinking he is a trim,
health-conscious preppie. But there dwells within him the soul of
an old-fashioned, cigar-chomping Democratic pol, a veritable Tip
O'Neill,'' said Oliver.

   All but one of the delegates to the
Delaware state Republican convention support Vice President George
Bush's presidential bid, a top party official said Tuesday.
   Jeffrey T. Larson, executive director for the Republican State
Committee, said that over the past three weeks, 315 delegates to
the state convention were chosen during caucuses throughout the
state.
   ``I know of one delegate for Pat Robertson. There may be one or
two more, but I doubt it,'' he said. ``George Bush is probably
going to have 314 or 315 people supporting him at the state
convention because Pat Robertson isn't running for president
anymore.''
   The state convention is scheduled for May 14 in Rehoboth Beach,
where 17 delegates will be selected for the national nominating
convention in August in New Orleans.

   James W. Glosser was named Tuesday by
Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng as administrator of the
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.
   Glosser has been acting head of the Agriculture Department
agency since the death in February of Donald L. Houston. The job
pays $75,500 a year.
   The agency, which calls itself APHIS, oversees a number of
federal regulatory programs affecting the nation's livestock and
plants.
   Glosser received a doctorate in veterinary medicine from
Washington State University and worked from 1966 to 1973 for the
federal Centers of Disease Control as a veterinary epidemioligist.
   After that, Glosser worked for the Montana Department of
Livestock as chief of the disease control bureau and later as head
of the animal health division. He joined the USDA agency in 1983 as
assistant administrator and held the No. 2 position of associate
administrator at the time of Houston's death.

<HEAD>19 Arrested For Stealing Telephone Access Codes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Pres Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nineteen people were arrested for allegedly
stealing telephone access codes and selling them to hundreds of
customers at a cost to five long-distance carriers of $4.5 million
in fraudulent phone calls, the government announced Tuesday.
   The 19 people obtained credit card numbers and access codes from
computer hackers using specially designed programs to search phone
systems for workable codes, the U.S. attorney's office in Honolulu
said.
   The U.S. Secret Service caught the 19 in an eight-month
undercover operation in which a secret service agent operated as an
illegal distributor of codes through his own Honolulu company
called Pacific Telecommunications, known to the users as the
Coconut Connection.
   ``These people ... hacked out these access codes using
computers, and then sold the stolen codes through illegal
multilevel marketing schemes,'' said Steve Ramsay, in charge of the
Secret Service office in Honolulu.
   ``Hundreds of people throughout the country bought these stolen
access codes ... for $100 to $150 per month for unlimited
long-distance service,'' Ramsay added.
   During the undercover operation, agents made more than 600 phone
contacts with people involved in marketing access codes and
received from those who were indicted more than 600 illegally
obtained codes, reported the Justice Department in Washington.
   It is the largest probe of telephone access code devices in the
industry's history.
   US Sprint lost $3 million as a result of the schemes and ``we
would have lost at least 10 times as much if not for the success''
of the undercover operation, said Del Wnorowski, senior vice
president and general counsel for US Sprint.
   Secret Service agents sold some US Sprint long-distance access
codes to track the extent of the illegal operations, said Dan Bent,
the U.S. Attorney in Honolulu. Bent said those indicted were
``high-level distributors'' of telephone access codes.
   After the Secret Service provided one distributor a code, within
four days it accumulated $73,600 in illegal charges.
   Four federal grand jury indictments were handed down April 14 in
Honolulu as a result of the operation, but were sealed until the
arrests began Monday.
   The theft of telephone access codes is a ``recent phenomenon, in
the past three or four years we've seen it blossoming,'' said
Robert Godbey, an assistant U.S. attorney in Honolulu.
   The Communications Fraud Control Association, a long-distance
phone clearinghouse, says losses from all types of access device
fraud at half a billion dollars annually for the $40 billion a year
long-distance telephone industry.

<HEAD>Panel Says Chambers' Farm Should Not Become Historic Landmark</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Maryland farm where the ``pumpkin papers''
that led to the perjury conviction of Alger Hiss were hidden should
not be designated as a national historic landmark, an advisory
panel said Tuesday.
   It was the Hiss case in 1948 that vaulted a fairly obscure young
congressman named Richard Nixon to fame.
   The recommendation of the Advisory Board of the National Park
Service could be overruled, Interior Department spokesmen said.
   The board, meeting in Harpers Ferry, W.Va., made the
recommendation on the grounds that 50 years have not elapsed since
the events that gave the site significance, said George Berklacy,
spokesman for the National Park Service.
   The principal significant event was the retrieval of microfilm
from a hollowed-out pumpkin for Nixon, then a member of the House
Un-American Activities Committee, by the owner of the farm, a Time
magazine editor named Whittaker Chambers.
   Chambers had accused Hiss, a former State Department official,
of being a fellow member of a communist spy ring. Hiss sued
Chambers for libel, but Chambers' production of the filmed State
Department documents he said Hiss had given him in 1938 led to
Hiss' conviction for perjury for denying to the committee that he
had handed over the documents.
   The park service generally follows a policy of letting a 50-year
interval lapse to make sure history has gained enough perspective
on events for fair designation of landmarks, Berklacy said.
   ``It is not a hard and fast rule,'' he said. The secretary of
the interior, who makes such designations, has the final say and
may overrule the board, Berklacy noted.
   David Prosperi, spokesman for Interior Secretary Donald P.
Hodel, hinted strongly that Hodel might do just that.
   It was Hodel who nominated the 390-acre farm at Westminster,
Md., some 30 miles northwest of Baltimore, now owned by Chambers'
son John.
   ``We're checking into the precedents,'' Prosperi said, adding,
``The secretary hasn't pushed it this hard and this far just to
leave it here.''
   Chambers' testimony before the committee and his 1952
autobiography, ``Witness,'' strongly influenced a generation of
conservatives, among them President Reagan, who awarded a
posthumous Medal of Freedom to Chambers in 1984.
   The case was a watershed in American life, with many people
becoming convinced by it that communists had targeted American life
and institutions for damage, if not for takeovers, and others
refusing to concede either a threat from communism or the guilt of
Hiss.
   Hiss, who lives in New York, served 44 months in prison. He
maintains his innocence. Chambers died in 1961.
   Designation as a landmark carries no obligation and no reward
other than a plaque. Some 1,800 sites nationwide have been made
landmarks.

<HEAD>Police Commissioner To Koch: Apologize For Jackson Attacks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward said Tuesday
that Mayor Edward I. Koch ought to apologize for his ``divisive''
attacks on Jesse Jackson during the New York primary.
   Ward, the city's first black police commissioner and a Koch
appointee, said the mayor's acknowledgement that he had been left
``bloodied'' but unbowed by the uproar surrounding his criticism of
Jackson did not suffice as an apology.
   ``It's not enough to say `I'm bloodied.' ... It's not a time for
more people to get bloodied! If you're bloodied, maybe you need
Florence Nightingale. You don't need somebody else with a bat and a
hatchet,'' Ward told reporters at City Hall.
   At an appearance in Washington on Tuesday, Koch offered an
apology for hurting black people's feelings but stopped short of
saying he was sorry for his remarks.
   ``When you ask me about blacks and their sensitivity, I'm sorry
that I injured their feelings but I will try to redress that as
best I can,'' he said. ``Not just with words but with programs.''
   He said his new budget on May 9 would include housing, health
and education programs aimed at helping New York's blacks.
   Asked if these programs were evolving because of the harsh
criticism to which he has been subjected, Koch, who has said he
plans to run for a fourth term next year, replied, ``Oh, sure.
Absolutely.''
   During the campaign, Koch criticized Jackson's stand on Israel
and said Jews and other supporters of that nation would be
``crazy'' to vote for him.
   He also said he thought Jackson's positions on national spending
would bankrupt the country, that his defense policy would disarm
the United States, and that he had ``lied'' about his actions the
night the Rev. Martin Luther King was assassinated.
   Ward said he did not know Koch's intentions in making those
remarks.
   ``But, whatever the mayor thought he was doing ... I'm here to
tell him, and I think the whole city community, black and white, is
saying that, `It didn't come out right, Ed. And it has a divisive
tone to it. And there is a time for some healing and consensus
playing that this city really can't afford what's come out of this.
And enough is enough and times is tough.'''

   The Treasury Department annnounced a move
Tuesday to accommodate people who get a middle-of-the-night yen to
buy a U.S. Savings Bond. Now all you need is a telephone and a
credit card.
   Beginning May 3, the government will accept VISA or MasterCard
numbers on its toll-free number: 1-800-US-BONDS.
   Subject to credit limits, callers can buy Series EE bonds around
the clock in denominations ranging from $50 to $10,000.
   ``We expect sales _ already at their highest levels since World
War II _ to surge as people learn they can buy bonds at any time,
from any phone,'' Jerrold B. Speers, executive director of the
savings bond program, said in a statement.
   Speers said the program is, in part, aimed at people looking for
a last-minute gift.
   The bonds will be mailed within three weeks, but purchasers will
earn interest from the first day of the month of their order. The
bonds cost half of the face value. When held five years or longer,
they offer market-based rates of six percent or higher.

   The United States and the Soviet Union signed
an agreement Tuesday to cooperate in regulating the safety of
civilian nuclear reactors.
   The accord was signed at the State Department on the second
anniversary of the accident at the Soviets' Chernobyl plant.
Thirty-one deaths have been attributed to the disaster near Kiev.
   The United States had its own nuclear accident at Three Mile
Island, near Harrisburg, Pa., in 1979. There were no fatalities but
questions were raised about the safety of nuclear plants.
   The agreement provides for the exchange of technical information
about the design and construction of nuclear reactors and safety
research. It will be in force for five years and can be extended
for five-year periods.
   Lando W. Zech Jr., chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, signed for the United States. Alexander N. Protsenko,
chairman of the Soviet State Committee for the Utilization of
Atomic Energy, signed for his government.
   A joint committee will convene once a year to review proposals
to enhance the safety of nuclear reactors.
   The Soviet delegation on Monday visited the Baltimore gas and
electric nuclear plant. Zech will visit a Soviet plant in August.

   Damage claims in the millions of dollars
were predicted by insurance agents Tuesday after hail the size of
tennis balls pounded cars and trucks at dealerships, shopping malls
and suburban streets.
   ``Do you know what complete havoc is?'' said Tom Hollingshead, a
State Farm insurance agent whose office was besieged by phone calls
from insured clients with pocked, pelted and smashed cars and
trucks.
   ``It looks horrible,'' car dealer Frank McGough said as he
surveyed the damage at Capitol Chevrolet in Montgomery after Monday
evening's hail storm.
   ``We've got close to 2,000 vehicles on our lot, and I would say
99 percent of them have some damage,'' McGough said. ``Hail is the
worst thing that can happen to an automobile dealership because it
dents all your vehicles up.''
   McGough said one employee estimated damages at close to
$500,000. ``We've had some people working here 40 years, and they
say this is the worst they've ever seen,'' McGough said.
   Tom McCollum, senior vice president of claims at Alfa Insurance
Co., estimated the cost of the storm will be more than $1 million
by the time all Alfa claims are submitted. He said Alfa called in
20 extra agents from throughout the state to help handle claims.
   Emergency management officials said there were numerous reports
of heavy thunderstorms and hailstorms during the afternoon and
early evening Monday but that there were no reports of any tornado
touching down. State troopers reported no fatalities or serious
injuries related to the storms.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Tuesday temporarily
enjoined the merger of two of the nation's leading spice
manufacturers pending Federal Trade Commission review of the
proposed deal.
   U.S. District Judge John H. Pratt granted an FTC request to stop
the scheduled completion on Friday of McCormick & Co. Inc's
purchase of Specialty Brands Co. of San Francisco, which makes
Spice Islands gourmet spices.
   Pratt issued the order from the bench and scheduled a May 3
hearing on the FTC's motion for a preliminary injunction against
completion of the merger.
   The FTC contended that McCormick, the world's largest spice
manufacturer, failed to comply with its requests for documents the
agency needs to determine if the deal would lessen competition.
   Specialty Brands, owned by United Biscuit, recently sold its
salad dressing and olive business to Campbell Soup Co. McCormick,
based in Hunt Valley, Md., is seeking to buy the company's Spice
Islands and Taste of Americana gourmet spice operations.
   FTC attorney Steven Newborn told Pratt that the agency had
significant questions about whether the proposed merger would
lessen competition because both companies have large shares of the
U.S. spice market.
   Newborn said the agency can't make a final determination until
McCormick furnishes the documents sought by the FTC.
   McCormick's attorneys contended that the company did comply with
the FTC's request on April 8.
   Last week, McCormick filed a lawsuit in federal court in
Baltimore charging that the FTC was illegally using the pre-merger
notification provisions of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act to delay the
merger.
   Company spokesman Mac Barrett said that since January, McCormick
has given the FTC more than 120,000 pages of documents.
   ``Our desire has always been to resolve this application in a
spirit of cooperation, but the company believes that the matter of
document production has reached an impasse,'' he said.

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chemical warfare is being waged on larger
scale than ever in the Iran-Iraq war, according to a U.N. report
released Tuesday.
   The report does not say who has been using the outlawed weapons.
Iran and Iraq have accused each other of launching chemical warfare
attacks in the 7{-year-old war.
   The report could prove a disappointment to Iran, which has been
urging the United Nations to condemn Iraq for practicing chemical
warfare.
   Investigations in past years confirmed that Iraq used chemical
weapons.
   In releasing the 26-page report, Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar expressed his ``deep sense of dismay and foreboding at
the mission's conclusions that chemical weapons continue to be used
in the conflict ... and that their use in recent days has evidently
been on an even more intensive scale than before.''
   U.N. experts examined victims in Iran and Iraq and concluded
most were suffering from exposure to mustard gas, a World War I-era
agent. A few had been exposed to a nerve gas, the experts said.
   The team said they examined 39 Iraqi victims, all military
personnel, and 66 Iranians, both soldiers and civilians.
   Iran claims Iraqi victims were exposed to poisonous gases used
by Iraq on enemy troops.
   Dr. Manuel Dominguez, the head of the team, said ``the use of
yperite (mustard gas) was unmistakably confirmed.'' Dominguez is a
colonel in the Spanish army who specializes in nuclear, biological
and chemical weapons injuries.
   Even though the report did not lay blame, Iraq said it was
satisfied.
   ``It definitely bears out our contention that Iran used chemical
weapons,'' said Mudhafar al-Amin, counselor to the Iraqi mission to
the United Nations.
   Iranian officials refused to comment.
   The U.N. team spent three days in Iran and three days in Iraq,
examining victims in an Iraqi military hospital in Baghdad and at
several facilities in Iran.
   Dominguez said that because of ``security reasons,'' the team
did not visit the Kurdish border town of Halabja, where Iran says
thousands of civilians died in Iraqi bombardment on March 16-17.
   In a 1987 investigation, U.N. experts collected weapons
fragments from the scenes of chemical warfare attacks to analyze
them to determine their origin. That investigation pointed the
finger at Iraq.
   In the most recent study, the team did not gather weapons
fragments.
   However, the experts said they were shown shrapnel from bombs
dropped on an Iranian village on March 29. The report said the
shrapnel ``was observed to bear markings in Cyrillic,'' the
alphabet used in the Soviet Union.
   The Soviet Union is Iraq's main arms supplier.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate committee on Tuesday approved a
measure sought by the small aircraft industry that would place
limits on accident liability.
   The measure, which was approved by the Senate Commerce Committee
on a voice vote, would establish a series of federal standards for
determining liability in an accident involving aircraft seating
less than 20 people and that are not flying scheduled passenger
routes.
   The measure would replace what industry officials and private
plane owners complain is a hodge-podge of conflicting state laws.
   Manufacturers argue that their insurance costs have multiplied
by 500 percent since 1981. As a result of that increase and rising
court judgments, the number of private planes produced in this
country has declined from a record 17,000 in 1979 to 1,085 last
year, the industry says.
   The bill would place no limit on the amount of money a victim
could recover in damages. But in perhaps its most controversial
provision, it would prohibit accident victims from obtaining
damages in most cases in which the aircraft was more than 20 years
old.
   Consumer groups and trial lawyers have opposed the legislation,
contending it would make it too difficult for victims to collect
damages and thus eliminate an incentive that manufacturers have to
make the aircraft safe.
   The House aviation subcommittee approved a similar bill March 3
that would limit manufacturers' liability to aircraft 12 years old
or less. But the measure faces bleak prospects in that chamber
because three full committees _ Public Works, Energy and Commerce
and Judiciary _ must complete work on the legislation before it
reaches the House floor.
   The Senate panel sent the bill to the full chamber, with Sen.
Bob Packwood objecting. The Oregon Republican complained that the
measure would make it too difficult for passengers aboard aircraft
involved in accidents to prove the plane was defective.
   The measure is sponsored by Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., whose
state is home to Cessna Aircraft Co., the Beech Aircraft Corp. and
other private plane builders.

   Ever wonder why it seems men are always
waiting for women to return from the restroom in public places?
   It's because the standard 50-50 ratio between men's and women's
toilet facilities is not fair, according to a Cornell University
undergraduate who studied the situation at highway rest stops for
the Washington Department of Transportation.
   A more equitable arrangement would be a 60-40 ratio of women's
to men's stalls, said Anh Tran, a sophomore studying operations
research at the Ivy League school who would like to work in the
hotel industry.
   The 20-year-old was one of two people hired by the Washington
department to prowl restrooms along the state's highways to see why
more women were standing in line than men.
   William Carr, Tran's supervisor in Washington, said the agency
was trying to document the long-time complaints of women having to
wait to use the facilities. The agency is now updating its criteria
for rest stop design.
   Tran said she found that men spend an average of 45 seconds in a
bathroom stall while women are there for an average of 79 seconds.
The men were timed by a male employee.
   Tran timed restroom use over the weekends last summer. She also
counted dead deer found along the roadside. She isn't sure what
she'll be doing this summer.

pie.
   The legislation was sent to the Senate on a vote of 107-3.
   ``We have been deprived too long,'' said Rep. Norman Ostrau, who
sponsored the bill. ``From sea to shining sea, we are saying `Let
there be key lime pie.'''
   The House appeared to be on a roll for designating state
symbols. On Monday, the chamber approved a bill to designate Myakka
fine sand as the official state soil.
   One of the three House members who voted against the key lime
pie bill said he had had enough.
   ``It's getting absurd,'' said Rep. Dale Patchett, who also voted
against the Myakka fine sand bill. ``It cost $500 or $600 to move
(this bill) through the House. Besides, I don't like key lime pie.''
   The pies can be made from the juice of any variety of the tart
citrus fruit, but some proponents say the only real ones are those
made with the small, greenish-yellow variety known as the key lime.
Eggs and sweetened, condensed milk are the other primary
ingredients.

<HEAD>Daughter: Mom Talked Of Copying Tylenol Poisoning Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stella Nickell, accused of killing her husband
and a second person by putting cyanide in Excedrin capsules, had
discussed copying the Tylenol poisoning case in which seven
Chicago-area people died, her daughter testified Tuesday.
   Cindy Hamilton said her mother suggested the 1982 Tylenol
episode ``would be very easy to re-enact,'' safer and less
expensive than hiring a hit man or other ways Mrs. Nickell had
discussed for killing Bruce Nickell.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Joanne Maida, who led Hamilton through
two hours of tearful testimony, asked her to explain.
   ``In her (Mrs. Nickell's) own words, it would have been `easy
because they were looking for looking for people shoplifting and
taking things from the store ... not for putting something back,'''
Hamilton said.
   The testimony occurred in the seventh day of the nation's first
trial of anyone charged with causing death by tampering with
over-the-counter medicine. The Chicago case has not been solved.
   Nickell, 52, who was Hamilton's stepfather, and Susan Katherine
Snow, 40, of suburban Kent, both died in June 1986 after ingesting
Excedrin capsules containing cyanide.
   Prosecutors say the effort by Mrs. Nickell, 44, to make the two
deaths look like random killings began to unravel when her daughter
went to authorities.
   Hamilton, 28, frequently sobbed as she described how her mother
discussed at least four ways of killing Nickell, who died in what
prosecutors say was a plot to collect insurance money.
   Government investigators found Mrs. Nickell's fingerprints in
library books about poisons, and at least one insurance policy in
Nickell's name was forged, prosecutors say.
   Hamilton said that at first she didn't think too much about what
her mother was telling her. She was an intelligent woman who
collected information on a wide range of subjects, Hamilton said of
her mother. But gradually, Hamilton said, her mother began
mentioning Nickell more often during the conversations.
   ``I know my mother very well, and basically, I knew she was
capable of it (murder),'' Hamilton sobbed on the witness stand.
``But I was hoping she wouldn't.''
   Hamilton said her mother discussed hiring a hit man, but
dismissed the idea as too expensive, and contemplated slipping him
cocaine on the theory that authorities would conclude that Nickell,
a recovering alcoholic, had switched from alcohol to drugs and had
accidentally overdosed.
   Mrs. Nickell related that the cocaine ``could be put in his tea.
It basically couldn't be tasted in iced tea,'' Hamilton quoted her
mother as saying.
   Mrs. Nickell made one failed attempt to poison her husband by
placing black seeds that she believed were toxic in capsules, and
giving the capsules to Nickell along with his morning vitamins and
orange juice, Hamilton said.
   Hamilton said her mother also asked her how much heroin was
needed for an overdose, but never linked that question to her
repeated tales of dissatisfaction with Nickell.
   When her mother initially asked about buying heroin and other
drugs, ``I thought she may have possibly been thinking about
acquiring it (heroin) to supplement her income,'' she said.
   ``I just couldn't picture my mother selling drugs,'' she said.

<HEAD>Saudi Arabia Breaks Relations With Iran</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS lede to CLARIFY Saudi Arabia breaking diplomatic
relations.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia announced Tuesday it
was breaking diplomatic relations with Iran and asked Iranian
Embassy officials to leave the kingdom within a week.
   The announcement, read on state-run television, said the rupture
came about because of several reasons. Among them were a riot by
Iranians during a pilgrimage to Mecca last year and a subsequent
attack on the Saudi Embassy in Tehran, it said.
   An informed source in Washington, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the Saudi council of ministers made the decision at
a meeting Monday night.
   Saudi Arabia, like most of the Arab countries, supports Iraq in
its 7{-year-old war with Iran.
   Iran and oil-rich Saudi Arabia have been at odds since the riots
in Mecca on July 31, 1987 that killed 275 Iranian pilgrims and the
subsequent ransacking of the Saudi Embassy in Tehran by mobs. A
Saudi diplomat later died of injuries sustained in the attack.
   The Saudis said a total of 402 people were killed in a stampede
after a political demonstration by the Iranians turned violent.
   Tehran said that Saudi police caused most of the casualties by
shooting into the crowd.
   Mecca, the birthplace of Prophet Mohammed, and Medina, site of
Mohammed's tomb, are the holiest places for the world's 850 million
Moslems.
   They are located in a western Saudi Arabian region known as
Hijaz.
   After the Mecca riots Iranian leaders called for the overthrow
of King Fahd and the Saudi royal family, the seizure of its vast
wealth and for stripping them of the custodianship of the holy
shrines.
   Officials of the pro-Western conservative kingdom accused Iran's
revolutionary leaders of terrorism.
   Two weeks ago, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini said that 150,000
Iranian pilgrims would travel to Mecca this year and stage
demonstrations against the United States and Israel.
   Saudi Arabia had said it would cut the number of pilgrims
traveling to the holy city this year but has not announced any
figures.

   President Reagan, saying ``we cannot pause too
often to give thanks to mothers,'' declared May 8 Mother's Day in a
proclamation released Tuesday.
   ``Maternal love is the first tangible bond any human being
knows. It is a tie at once physical, emotional, psychological and
mystical,'' Reagan said.
   ``The mark of motherhood ... is a devotion to the well-being of
the child so total that it overlooks itself and its own preferences
and needs. It is a love that risks all, bears all, braves all,''
the proclamation said.
   ``As it heals and strengthens and inspires in its objects an
understanding of self-sacrifice and devotion, it is the parent of
many another love as well.''
   Reagan said ``generation after generation has measured love by
the work and wonder of motherhood. For these gifts, ever ancient
and ever new, we cannot pause too often to give thanks to mothers.
   ``As inadequate as our homage may be and as short as a single
day is to express it ... Mother's Day affords us an opportunity to
meet one of life's happiest duties.''

<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department said Tuesday that
an annual push is under way to hire 100 new scientists for
top-drawer research projects.
   Under the department's Research Associate Program, now in its
ninth year, the scientists will join veteran researchers to work on
projects as diverse as biotechnology and groundwater.
   Mary E. Carter, acting administrator of the department's
Agricultural Research Service, said the program rules require job
candidates to have earned a doctoral degree in the past three years.
   ``Talented new scientists will be hired for up to two years to
work alongside top-notch researchers around the country,'' she
said. ``We will provide more than $4 million in funds for these
associates.''
   Carter said that the agency for the first time will have a
research associate based at each of four historically black
colleges and universities. Those are: Fort Valley State College,
Georgia; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State
University; Prairie View A&M University, Texas; and University of
Maryland-Eastern Shore.
   Each of the new scientists will work full-time on one of 100
projects selected from 203 proposed by agency scientists in
laboratories and research centers across the country, she said.
   The 100 new research associates will be offered salaries ranging
from $27,716 to $33,218 per year.

<TEXT>
   The Soviets have shown a ``single-minded
attitude'' in improving submarine communications and may lead the
United States in developing powerful signals, a military
publication said Wednesday.
   The 1988 edition of Jane's Military Communications said,
however, that the United States was generally believed ahead in
research into laser-aided submarine communications, the most
advanced form.
   The work has gained importance because of the key role of
submarine-launched ballistic missiles under the superpower
agreement to eliminate medium- and shorter-range land-based nuclear
missiles from Europe.
   The highly penetrating Extremely Low Frequency communications
are resistant to jamming, can operate at great depths and can
survive a nuclear explosion, said Jane's. The manuel said the
United States was ahead in the less powerful of such signals, those
that penetrate down to nine yards.
   It said the United States was also leading in finding ways to
use laser transmitters carried on board satellites to relay
messages to submarines from shore installations, aircraft or
surface vessels.
   Such light can penetrate hundreds of yards beneath salt water,
editor John Williamson said in a forward to the manual.

   A teen-age gunman burst into a high
school classroom Tuesday and took 70 students hostage, then
randomly fired bullets into a wall before he was subdued by
students, authorities said.
   No one was hurt during the noon incident at San Gabriel High
School, 12 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles.
   Jeff Cox, 18, a former student at the school, was arrested and
taken to Alhambra Police Department for questioning, police said.
   ``We don't know the motive, but no one was hurt,'' said Lucia
Alvelais, spokeswoman for Alhambra police, which responded to the
shots-fired call at 11:34 a.m. The school is on the border of the
two communities.
   ``He was holding approximately 70 students hostage in the
classroom and occasionally fired rounds from a semi-automatic
weapon,'' said Ms. Alvelais, adding the shots fired into a wall
were intended as a threat.
   ``Then the rifle jammed and some students jumped him. The rest
of the students ran from the classroom and police arrested him,''
she said.
   Cox was arrested at 12:10 p.m.
   The school was closed for the day, and classes will resume
Wednesday, Ms. Alvelais said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted
16-1 Tuesday to subpoena the private working diaries of Lt. Col.
Oliver L. North in its continuing investigation of international
drug smuggling.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., expressed concern that the originals
of the North diaries have never been turned over to government
authorities in uncensored form but remain in the hands of North and
his attorney, Brendan V. Sullivan.
   The subpoena calls for North and Sullivan to produce 2,848 pages
of handwritten diary notes in their entirety and with no deletions.
   The notes cover the period from September 1984 until November
1986 when North was fired from his position on the National
Security Council in the Iran-Contra arms and money furor.
   A version of the North diary already has been made available to
the congressional Iran-Contra committees, but Kerry said North and
Sullivan heavily censored 1,269 pages with black ink.
   Speaking of the North diaries, Kerry told the committee: ``I'm
not asserting that there's a smoking gun or something hidden or
that some of the redactions (deletions) are not appropriate. My
assertion is that given what has already been declassified, I don't
know how we can proceed with our investigation without being able
to see all of it.
   ``The issue is one of investigation,'' Kerry said. ``Should we
have the right to look at these classified documents, a work
product of a government employee?''
   Seventy-four pages of North's notes were released Tuesday. Often
interspersed in notations about logistics of the war effort of the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels are numerous references to drugs, the Drug
Enforcement Administration and the Customs Service, Panamanian
ruler Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and CIA agents.
   But Kerry complained that most such references are preceeded or
followed with large blacked-out sections.
   One note dated June 27, 1984, says, ``Drug Case _ DEA progress
on combatting cocaine,'' and refers to possible Colombian
negotiations to move drug refining to Nicaragua.
   An entry from the previous month notes that CIA Latin American
chief Duane Clarridge had called and indicated that ``(name
deleted) contact indicates that Gustavo is involved with drugs.''
It is unclear to whom ``Gustavo'' refers.
   A July 24, 1984, entry states: ``Clarridge: (paragraph deleted)
_ Arturo Cruz Jr. _ Get Alfredo Cesar on drugs.''
   The passage's meaning is unclear. Cruz is the son of a former
member of the directorate of the United Nicaraguan Opposition, at
that time the Contra political umbrella. Cesar, now a member of the
Contra political directorate, was at the time associated with the
southern front in the Nicaraguan civil war, which was at odds with
UNO.
   Kerry has made clear he believes there was a connection between
drug running and efforts to supply and arm the Contras. Some
testimony before his subcommittee on narcotics and terrorism has
focused on that possibility.
   Contra leaders, however, have denied involvement in drug
trafficking.
   Censored versions of the diaries originally were provided to the
congressional Iran-Contra committees under the grant of limited
immunity from prosecution given to North in exchange for his
testimony before the panel last year.
   Kerry said that in order to speed up the process the Iran-Contra
panels permitted North and Sullivan to block out sections they
deemed to be irrelevant to that investigation.
   But Kerry said John Nields, chief counsel of the House
Iran-Contra committee, said there were many sections that appeared
to be ``very relevant'' to the Kerry narcotics investigation.
   And he made public a letter in which Sen. Daniel K. Inouye,
D-Hawaii, chairman of the Senate Iran-Contra committee, said: ``I
share your belief that the portion of the diaries which was
withheld from the select committees may contain important
information relevant to your inquiry.''
   Sullivan's law office here had no immediate comment on the
subpoena or on whether he and North would comply with it.
   Kerry said he was ``prepared to go the distance'' in pursuit of
North's diaries. ``If they resist, it will seem to me that there is
even more reason to believe there is something there that we have
to see.''
   North is facing trial on federal charges in the Iran-Contra
affair, but Kerry said he had been assured by the staff of
Iran-Contra independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh that making the
documents available to the Foreign Relations Committee would not
interfere with the prosecution.
   North and three co-defendants were indicted by a federal grand
jury on March 16 on conspiracy, theft and wire fraud charges
centering on the secret sale of U.S. weapons to Iran and the
alleged diversion of the proceeds to the Contras.
   Additionally, North was named in nine separate counts for
allegedly obstructing Congress making false statements, obstructing
justice and a presidential inquiry, destroying official documents
and conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue Service.
   Only Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., voted against issuing the
subpoena, saying he did so because he believed that North, a
personal friend, already is bearing a too heavy legal burden.

<HEAD>Two Fugitives Arrested As Result Of TV Shows Not Yet Broadcast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival television shows about wanted fugitives have led
indirectly to the arrests of one man on Iowa embezzlement charges
and another on California rape-murder charges, and both were
ordered held without bond Tuesday.
   James C. Stark, 40, was arraigned Tuesday in Ann Arbor, Mich.,
for being a fugitive from justice. He refused to waive extradition
to California.
   California officials said they will seek the death penalty on
rape and murder charges.
   Steven Riley Hadley, who had been living in Texas for three
years under the name Richard G. Finley, is charged with embezzling
$1.1 million in 1983 from the John Deere Employees Credit Union in
Waterloo, Iowa, where he worked. He appeared before a U.S.
magistrate in Houston.
   Asked by Texas police if he was Hadley, ``he answered, `Yes, I
am.' There was a big sigh of relief and then he said, `I'll
cooperate fully however I can,''' said Police Lt. Gary Edwards in
the Houston suburb of Friendswood.
   Both men were arrested Monday, when television programs
featuring them had not yet been broadcast.
   Stark's photograph appeared on television in Ann Arbor for 15
seconds Sunday night on a promotion for the April 30 broadcast of
Fox Broadcasting's ``America's Most Wanted.'' Five people called
police and said they recognized him.
   Hadley was scheduled to be featured in NBC's ``Unsolved
Mysteries'' on May 6. The FBI said it sent out wanted posters on
him to aid authorities in anticipation of public tips and inquiries
generated by the program. A copy was seen by Edwards, who had had
his eye on the free-spending Hadley for some time.
   ``There was no doubt in my mind it was him when I saw the
flier,'' Edwards said. ``I was shocked. I probably have 600 pages
of reports on this guy from the last three years, and he looks the
same.''
   Stark was ordered held without bail pending another hearing on
May 26. Hadley was ordered held without bail pending a bond hearing
Friday.
   California authorities had issued warrants charging Stark with
the May 1, 1987, slaying of a teen-age hitchhiker in Banning and a
Feb. 24 rape in Hemet.
   Stark, formerly of Yucaipa, Calif., allegedly shot the
still-unidentified teen-age girl when she tried to escape from him
at a service station in Banning, 90 miles east of Los Angeles.
   Riverside County Sheriff's Detective Sgt. Howard Rush, whose
investigation led to the warrant on the February kidnapping-rape,
said Stark had been convicted three times of kidnapping and sexual
assault and had spent ``almost all the time between 1971 and 1985
in California prisons and a mental hospital. He'd get out and do it
again.''
   Ann Arbor police arrested Stark on Monday at his car wash job
after the telephone tips.
   Hadley was reported missing by his wife and family in July 1983,
the same time the $1.1 million disappeared from the credit union.
   He called home to alert his wife to a letter he left behind. In
part of the letter included in federal court documents, Hadley
wrote to his wife, ``If I call you to read this letter, it means
that I have successfully left the state with around $1 million from
the credit union.''
   His first wife later divorced him, and he remarried.
   FBI agents and police called Hadley, 40, and asked him to come
to the police station Monday to discuss a neighborhood juvenile
case that Hadley and his new wife had reported, then confronted him
with the poster.
   After arriving in Friendswood, Hadley obtained the birth
certificate of Richard Glen Finley, who died after birth in Houston
in February 1948, Edwards said. With the birth certificate, he got
a Texas' drivers license and a passport.
   The ``Unsolved Mysteries'' segment that led to Hadley's capture
still will be broadcast May 6, and will include an update of his
arrest, said Wendy Bailey, field producer with Cosgrove Meurer
Productions of Los Angeles.

   Sen. Bob Dole, criticizing news coverage of
his unsuccessful campaign for the Republican presidential
nomination, said Tuesday that reporters were more interested in
``gossip and nit-picking'' than in covering the issues.
   Dole, the Senate Republican leader, said in a floor speech that
overall coverage of the 1988 presidential primaries was ``issueless
and negative.''
   The senator from Kansas said a predominantly liberal press corps
gave Republican candidates ``far more negative treatment than the
Democratic candidates.''
   ``What I witnessed generally on my own campaign plane was an
aircraft filled with reporters who became each other's best
audience,'' Dole said. ``It was an ultrainsider's game of gossip
and nit-picking that turned presidential campaign coverage into
`Trivial Pursuits.'''
   Dole cited a recent USA Today newspaper study he said showed
``network television coverage of the 1988 presidential campaign has
focused 80 percent of its time on everything but issues.''
   ``There was coverage of all kinds of gossip and `horse race'
stories, and judging from my own experience, who's on or off the
Dole campaign plane, which reporter will find that one person in a
friendly audience who can serve up a juicy negative quote, and on
and on and on.''
   He said the media were more interested in ``putting political
gossip above information, and titilation above education.''
   Dole also said GOP candidates received more negative treatment
than Democratic candidates.
   ``Something is out of whack _ and something is disturbingly
unfair _ when news coverage becomes so slanted, and the issues get
lost in the daily hype,'' he said.
   ``Look at the news rooms,'' Dole said. ``Let's face it, they
tend to be liberal. In all honesty, how many Republicans are out
there covering the candidates? Or Congress? I don't think I could
guess more than a carload.''
   ``Reporters try to be objective,'' Dole said. ``But try as they
do, they just can't help but see the world through liberal colored
glasses.''
   Dole said his audiences wanted to know where he stood on
individual issues. ``Unfortunately, the American people are not
getting what they want, at least from the news media,'' he said.
   ``It's a shame the media can't keep up with the people,'' Dole
said.

   The United States and Canada will not reach
agreement on a way to reduce acid rain emissions before the Reagan
administration leaves office, a senior administration official
predicted Tuesday on the eve of a visit by Canadian Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney.
   The official, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity,
denied that President Reagan agreed during a meeting with Mulroney
in Ottawa last April to commit the United States to specific
targets and timetables for the reduction of emissions.
   Mulroney, in a conversation with American reporters in the
Canadian capital on Friday, said he was disappointed with the
administration's lack of action against U.S. smokestack emissions
that he says are killing lakes and damaging forests north of the
border.
   And the Canadian Embassy in Washington, in a booklet distributed
in advance of Wednesay's meeting between Reagan and Mulroney, said,
``Canada cannot solve the problem on its own. ... Canada is taking
action and we expect the United States to do likewise.''
   Meanwhile, 19 senators, including six Republicans, released a
letter they had sent to Reagan urging him to reach agreement with
Mulroney at the meeting on the environmental issue.
   ``It would be most fitting for you to end your last summit
meeting with Prime Minister Mulroney with an agreement to control
acid rain,'' the letter said.
   The senators, most of them from the Northeast, included George
Mitchell, D-Maine, principal author of a clean air bill awaiting
floor action, and Robert Stafford of Vermont, senior Republican on
the Senate Environment Committee.
   Reagan's agreement to seek a bilateral accord with Canada on the
issue was inserted, during his meeting with Mulroney in Ottawa, in
a speech the president made later in the day at the Canadian
parliament.
   The official, who was present at the meeting, said Reagan
``hasn't changed his mind'' about trying to reach an agreement.
   But the official said that when the United States later proposed
an accord, ``it did not meet what Canada apparently wanted in this
specific area, which is targets and timetables.''
   ``I am not aware of any time that the two leaders agreed that
the accord would include targets and timetables,'' the
administration official said.
   Instead, the official said, Reagan and Mulroney agreed to ``try
to find a bilateral accord that moved us ahead a little, but we
haven't been able to.''
   Canada proposed a draft treaty calling for a 44 percent
reduction in estimated northbound flow of sulfur dioxide, a
pollutant from coal-fired power plants and other sources that
provides a key raw material for making acid rain. Of about 23
million tons of U.S. sulfur dioxide emissions, about 4 million tons
flows north across the border _ an amount Canada proposed should be
limited to 2.2 million tons.
   Reagan and Mulroney did agree two years ago that the United
States should pursue a $5 billion, five-year demonstration effort
to move ``clean coal'' combustion technologies into commercial use
in a way that would reduce pollution flow across the boundary.
Though Congress has cooperated in providing the government's half
share of the money, few projects are under way yet and
environmentalists criticize the program as little more than a pork
barrel for the coal and utility industries.
   Asked whether the United States and Canada would be able to
reach agreement by Jan. 20, when the Reagan administration leaves
office, on an approach that will significantly reduce acid rain,
the official said: ``No, I don't. It is a difference in approach.''
   ``If you are going to put a lot of money into something, you had
better make sure you have the right technology,'' the official
said. ``You had better know there is a direct relationship between
what you are doing and where the acid deposition is coming from.''
   When asked whether this meant the administration considered the
problem too costly to tackle, the official said, ``It is too dear
if you are using the wrong technologies and when you get all done
you haven't solved the Canada problem. People are just simply very
reluctant to say, `Here we go full tilt,' and when you get done you
haven't solved the problem as it addresses itself in the
U.S.-Canadian relationship.''

   The International Court of Justice
ruled Tuesday that the United States violated its treaty with the
United Nations in its attempt to close the Palestine Liberation
Organization mission in New York.
   The court, which has no enforcement powers, sided with the
United Nations and ruled that the PLO issue must go to independent
arbitration. It rebuked the Reagan administration for its efforts
to close the PLO mission.
   The United States sought a New York federal court order to close
the mission after President Reagan signed new anti-terrorist
legislation in December. Under the law, the PLO is classified as a
``terrorist organization'' and is prevented from operating on U.S.
soil.
   The U.S. court has not yet acted.
   The world court president, Jose Maria Ruda, reading from the
25-page opinion, said the closure proceedings violated a 1947 pact
between the United States and the United Nations that assured
diplomats unhindered access to the international organization.
   That accord, called the the Headquarters Agreement, calls for
arbitration in such disputes. The United States has rejected
arbitration.
   The U.S. government maintains that the anti-terrorist law is
exempt from ``any international legal obligations that the United
States may have under the Headquarters Agreement.''
   The Reagan administration move against the PLO's American
presence has been condemned by all U.N. member nations except the
United States and Israel.
   Carl-August Fleischhauer of West Germany, the U.N.
undersecretary-general for legal affairs, told reporters after
Tuesday's ruling that he was not optimistic that the United States
would submit to arbitration.
   ``Although we want harmonious relations with our host country,
we are satisfied that the court spoke in the same sense as we
did,'' Fleischhauer said.
   ``We are ready to go to arbitration. It is now basically for the
United States government to decide what conclusions it draws from
this ruling,'' he said.
   The PLO was granted permanent observer status by the United
Nations General Assembly in 1974, and its U.N. mission has been
operating since then out of an office in Manhattan.
   The PLO's information office in Washington was closed down prior
to passage of the American legislation.
   Early this year, the U.S. government said that arbitration was
premature, noting that the anti-terrorist law would go into effect
on March 22.
   When the PLO refused to comply with U.S. Attorney General Edwin
Meese III's March 22 order to close down its Manhattan office, the
U.S. government filed suit in federal court.
   The American judge on the world court, Stephen M. Schwebel,
voted against Washington.
   In a separate opinion, Schwebel said that although he had
reservations about the court's opinion ``a state cannot avoid its
international responsibility'' by referring issues such as the PLO
mission dispute to a domestic court.
   Since only sovereign states and U.N. bodies are entitled to
bring cases before the court, the PLO has been unable to plead its
case. But confidential briefs believed to support its position have
been filed by Syria and East Germany.
   In 1986, the court ordered a halt to Reagan administration
support for the rebels fighting the leftist Nicaraguan government,
ruling that the support violated international law. But the United
States boycotted most of those proceedings, claiming the court had
no jurisdiction in the case.

<TEXT>
   Ethiopia said Tuesday its troops
and those of neighboring Somalia have begun withdrawing from their
common border as part of a plan to end a century of hostilities
between the East African neighbors.
   The government-owned newspaper The Ethiopian Herald said a joint
military committee monitored the initial withdrawals, which took
place from April 15-23.
   Ethiopia and Somalia agreed on April 4 to restore diplomatic
relations broken 11 years ago when they went to war over a patch of
land.
   They also agreed to move their forces six to nine miles from the
border to ease tensions, with redeployment to be completed by May
15.
   Neither side has said how many troops were involved. The Somali
military, however, had estimated that Ethiopia had 150,000 troops
stationed permanently on the Somali front.
   Marxist Ethiopia has the largest military force in black Africa,
more than 500,000 members, including local militia.
   Somalia has a military force of 65,000.
   Border disputes have made Ethiopia and Somalia enemies for more
than a century. In 1977-78, they fought a full-scale war after
Somalia invaded the Ogaden, a semiarid region of eastern Ethiopia
populated by ethnic Somalis.
   Ethiopia drove back the invaders with the help of thousands of
Cuban troops and arms from the Soviet Union, Ethiopia's chief ally.

<HEAD>Paper Prints Details on Removal of Stalin's Body</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In another attack on the legacy of Josef Stalin, a
newspaper gave details Tuesday about the removal of his body from
the Red Square mausoleum where the body of Soviet founder Vladimir
I. Lenin is entombed.
   The labor newspaper Trud published an article in response to a
question from an 18-year-old soldier, V. Kuzmin, who said many
young Soviets knew nothing about the removal of Stalin's body from
the mausoleum in 1961.
   Under the more open atmosphere fostered by Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev, Soviet scholars and journalists have begun
re-evaluating Stalin's record. He ruled the Soviet Union from 1927
until his death in 1953.
   Under his dictatorship, millions of people perished in purges,
forced collectivization of agriculture and rapid industrialization.
   Trud said that when Stalin died, ``many people did not know of
the circumstances connected with the gross political mistakes,
massive repression and lawlessness'' during his regime.
   Stalin's body was removed from the mausoleum and buried in the
Kremlin wall during the night of Oct. 31-Nov. 1, 1961, at the time
of the 22nd Communist Party congress.
   The party was led at that time by Nikita S. Khrushchev, who had
denounced Stalin's ``cult of personality'' during a secret speech
to party officials five years earlier.
   Col. K.A. Moshkov, who was in charge of overseeing the
mausoleum, told Trud he was called to the Kremlin for a meeting
Oct. 31 at which officials decided where to place Stalin's body.
   He said the officials had considered placing it in Moscow's
Novodevichy Cemetery, where Stalin's wife Nadezhda was buried after
she committed suicide in 1932, but agreed to place it in the
Kremlin wall.
   Moshkov told Trud that soldiers moved the body during the night,
with only Stalin's daughter Svetlana present.
   In the morning the official news media carried a one-sentence
statement that Stalin's body had been moved.
   Lenin's body has been enshrined in the mausoleum since his death
in 1924.
   In a speech last November, Gorbachev said Stalin's guilt was
``enormous and unforgivable,'' but he defended the former leader's
basic policies.

<HEAD>Defense Lawyer Criticizes Prosecutor's Attempt to Limit Access to
Documents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A defense lawyer for Iran-Contra defendant
Albert Hakim accused prosecutors Tuesday of violating a court order
by trying to limit his client's access to classified documents
compiled in the case.
   The procedures proposed by independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh
to limit Hakim's right to see certain highly sensitive government
documents ``directly contravene'' U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.
Gesell's order, defense lawyer N. Richard Janis charged in court
papers.
   Janis said Walsh's proposal also would limit access of retired
Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord, Hakim's former business
partner who also is charged with participating in the illegal
conspiracy to divert U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan
Contra rebels.
   The two brokered the arms sales through a series of Swiss-based
companies, which also funneled money to the Contras.
   Under the proposal by Walsh's office, all classified documents
turned over to the defense would be made available to lawyers for
Hakim and Secord as well as counsel for the other two defendants:
Marine Lt. Col. Oliver L. North and former national security
adviser John M. Poindexter.
   North, a fired National Security Council aide, and Poindexter,
also would be allowed to review all documents furnished to the
lawyers, according to a proposal outlined in a letter sent by
Walsh's office this week to defense counsel.
   Before they left the White House staff in November 1986, both
North and Poindexter had security clearances and access to the
nation's most well-kept secrets and presumably saw _ or generated _
much of the material collected by Walsh's investigators.
   But Walsh's proposal said Hakim and Secord would not get
automatic access to ``particularly sensitive information.''
   This material includes documents whose disclosure would
jeopardize the lives of hostages in the Middle East or compromise
U.S. intelligence methods, ``particularly sensitive military
operations'' and ``extremely sensitive foreign policy
initiatives,'' according to the letter.
   Hakim, a native of Iran who has U.S. citizenship, has never had
access to government documents. Secord, who once held sensitive
positions in the Pentagon, held a number of security clearances
before his Air Force retirement.
   Gesell ordered Walsh on April 15 to allow the defense to review
some 300,000 pages of classified material to determine if it would
help their case. An interagency task force is checking the material
before it is turned over to the defendants to see what highly
sensitive information is included.
   The sensitive documents covered by Walsh's proposal comprise
between 5 percent and 10 percent of the material reviewed so far,
defense lawyers were told at a recent meeting with prosecutors.
   Under the proposal that Janis contends violates Gesell's April
15 order, defense lawyers could show Hakim and Secord certain
sensitive documents only after obtaining the judge's permission.
   ``It would be within the court's discretion to solicit the
government for its views and to make special arrangements for
access as the court deems appropriate,'' associate independent
counsel Geoffrey Stewart wrote in the letter outlining the proposal
to defense counsel.
   During the hearing, Janis told Gesell that Hakim ``has no less a
need than the other defendants'' to review the documents.
   Gesell assured Janis that he would not bar defense lawyers from
telling their clients anything about the case, including
information in classified documents.
   In his protective order, the judge said the defendants and their
lawyers could gain access to the documents if they signed
agreements not to disclose the information.
   Gesell's order warned that unauthorized disclosure could result
in prosecution and he set stringent conditions for working with the
documents in a special secure area being constructed by the Justice
Department.
   Janis said the proposed procedures ``directly contravene the
court's protective order, which places only limited conditions on
access to classified information, all of which were met by Mr.
Hakim and his counsel.''
   ``Both judicial precedent and the pronouncements of this court
make it clear that the government must now give Mr. Hakim access to
the information in its possession or face dismissal of the
indictment against Mr. Hakim,'' Janis said.
   Under the Classified Information Procedures Act, classified
documents deemed relevant to the case could only be introduce as
evidence by either side if they are declassified by the government.
   At the April 12 hearing, Gesell warned that he would be forced
to dismiss the case if Walsh were unable to get relevant documents
declassified. ``The classification system must be adjusted to the
needs of the case or the case will collapse,'' Gesell said.

<HEAD>Saudi Arabia Breaks Relations With Iran</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with more detail, quotes.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia accused Iran of
``terrorism and subversion'' and broke relations Tuesday, ordering
all Iranian diplomats to leave the kingdom within a week.
   A statement broadcast by state-run television and distributed by
the official Saudi Press Agency cited a riot by Iranians during a
pilgrimage to Mecca last year in which hundreds of people died, a
subsequent attack on the Saudi Embassy in Tehran and attacks on
commercial shipping in the Persian Gulf.
   On Sunday, Iranian speedboats attacked a Saudi-owned tanker in
the Strait of Hormuz hours after President Reagan warned Iran to
stay clear of neutral ships.
   An informed source in Washington said privately that the Saudi
council of ministers decided Monday night to end diplomatic
relations with Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's revolutionary regime.
   Saudi Arabia and most other Arab countries support Iraq in its
war with Iran, which began in September 1980. Iran is a Moslem
nation but its people are Persian, not Arab.
   The Saudi statement said that King Fahd's government exercised
self-restraint and prudence for a long time, despite Iranian
practices that ``run counter to norms and diplomatic traditions,''
before deciding on the break.
   A memorandum about the decision was handed to the Iranian charge
d'affaires in Riyadh, the news agency reported.
   According to the published statement, ``The government of Saudi
Arabia has decided to sever its ties with the government of the
Islamic Republic of Iran and asked all personnel of the Iranian
Embassy in Riyadh and the consulate general in Jiddah to leave the
kingdom within a week.''
   Reagan warned Iran on Saturday, five days after the U.S. Navy
sank or disabled six Iranian naval vessels, against continuing
attacks on neutral shipping.
   Iran and Saudi Arabia have made virulent statements about each
other since riots in Mecca on July 31, 1987, that killed 275
Iranian pilgrims and the subsequent sacking of the Saudi Embassy in
Tehran. A Saudi diplomat died of injuries suffered in the attack.
   Saudi security officials said 402 people were killed in a
stampede after an Iranian political demonstration in Mecca turned
violent. Iran said Saudi police caused most of the casualties by
shooting into the crowd.
   Mecca, birthplace of the prophet Mohammed, and Medina, site of
his tomb, are the holiest places for the world's 850 million
Moslems. They are in a region of western Saudi Arabian called Hijaz.
   Iranian leaders, who often threaten to export their
fundamentalist revolution to Saudi Arabia and other gulf nations,
exhorted the world's Moslems after the Mecca riots to overthrow the
Saudi royal family, seize its vast wealth and take away
custodianship of the Islamic shrines.
   Officials of the pro-Western kingdom accused Iran of terrorism.
   Two weeks ago, Khomeini said 150,000 Iranian pilgrims would
travel to Mecca this year and demonstrate against the United States
and Israel.
   Government officials had said Saudi Arabia would reduce the
number of pilgrims traveling to the holy city this year but have
not given figures. Iran reacted by threatening to boycott the
annual pilgrimage.
   Saudi Arabia is the leading member of the Gulf Cooperation
Council, an economic and defense alliance that also includes
Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman.
   Arab diplomatic sources said it was unlikely other council
members would follow the Saudi lead and break with Iran, despite
Iranian missile attacks on Kuwaiti territory and raids on the
Emirates' offshore oil facilities.
   Earlier Tuesday, King Fahd decided to sign an international
treaty limiting the spread of nuclear arms. The move apparently
came in response to Israeli fears that the kingdom might arm its
missiles with nuclear warheads.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis captured 71
percent of the vote in Utah's caucuses in his strongest showing yet
in the West.
   With just over 90 percent of the vote counted Tuesday, the state
Democratic Party's unofficial tally showed Dukakis with 7,550 votes
to Jesse Jackson's 1,682, or 16 percent. Some 1,231, or 12 percent,
were uncommitted.
   Based on those tallies, Dukakis would pick up 21 of Utah's 23
Democratic delegates, while Jackson would gain two.
   Party officials said vote counting from Monday's caucuses was
progressing slowly Tuesday because of debate over a rule governing
uncommitted delegates and difficulties in contacting some county
leaders to get their returns.
   Official results were not likely to change the outcome for
Dukakis, however, who already has won commitments from three of the
state's five ``super delegates,'' bringing his Utah delegate total
to 24.
   ``We're really happy. It's his biggest victory in the West,''
said Gary Knoblock, Dukakis' state campaign coordinator. ``It's a
long way from home to be winning by this kind of margin. We've been
slowly climbing in the West, but this took a quantum leap.''
   Still, Dukakis supporters showed respect for Jackson's showing
in a state with a white population of 93 percent and where Jackson
received only 4 percent of the vote in 1984.
   ``He has moved the population that has not been involved in
politics,'' said Pat Shea, Dukakis' state co-chairman.
   ``The votes that came in for Jackson were certainly not
all-inclusive minority votes. I feel very good about what we've
done,'' said Jackson state chairman Marvin Davis.
   Republicans faced fewer choices at Monday's caucuses, which
included mainly advisory votes on their preferences for vice
president and whether they favor holding a Western regional primary
in 1992 similar to the South's Super Tuesday.
   Results of the Republican balloting will not be available for
several days, GOP Chairman Craig Moody said. ``But I know that
Elizabeth Dole, Howard Baker and Interior Secretary Donald Hodel
all were named.''

   A restructuring of federal airline and
interstate highway programs would eliminate bureaucratic practices
that interfere with aviation safety and road improvements, U.S.
Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley said Tuesday.
   When the interstate highway system is completed in the next few
years, the states should assume responsibility for their roads
because that way, the projects with the most merit would get top
priority, Burnley said.
   ``Costly and extraneous federal requirements now imposed on the
use of funds could be virtually eliminated, ensuring a greater
transportation return on every dollar spent,'' he told a convention
of the American Automobile Association.
   ``We are looking at ways to encourage and promote innovative
financing mechanisms'' such as permitting the use of tolls on
highways built with federal funds, he said.
   Burnley, who has proposed a reshaping of the Federal Aviation
Administration, told reporters that the FAA has never done an
adequate job of safety regulation and enforcement of the airline
industry because it is subjected to the federal budgetary process
and is operated through a maze of federal laws and rules.
   There is a ``morass of inhibitions on its growth and proper
management,'' said Burnley, who took over as transportation
secretary from Elizabeth Dole in December.
   He has described the FAA as a ``hybrid'' agency that combines
safety regulation and enforcement duties with the nuts-and-bolts
operation of running the air-traffic control system. Burnley would
like to separate the FAA's safety role from its operational
functions, and there is a move afoot in Congress to separate the
FAA from the Transportation Department.
   Burnley indicated he agreed with efforts to do so. He didn't say
how this should be done, but he said he would oppose turning air
traffic functions over to a privately run company.
   On airline safety , Burnley said, ``We've tried to toughen up
inspections across the board,'' pointing to the current
investigation of Texas Air Corp.'s Eastern Airlines.
   The 30-day, plane-by-plane inspection of Eastern's fleet, which
began April 13, is evaluating Eastern's ability to comply with FAA
safety standards and has resulted in a proposed $823,000 in fines
against the airline.
   Burnley, who flew to Orlando from Washington on Eastern, said
the airline is ``one of the safest, if not the safest, airlines in
America because of the attention it has received. ... I flew it
with extreme confidence today.''
   A similar inspection is also going on at Continental, another
Texas Air subsidiary.
   The transportation secretary said the FAA investigation was
under way before Eastern's pilots began a postcard campaign
detailing alleged maintenance and safety violations.
   ``I really resent the leadership of the union and the company
... using safety issues as a weapon against each other,'' Burnley
told a press conference. He said the two sides ``could duke it
out'' without resorting to safety allegations.
   In his luncheon speech to the AAA convention, Burnley said the
1987 traffic fatality rate was the lowest in history, with 2.4
deaths per 100 million miles traveled.
   ``There were just over 46,000 Americans killed on our highways
last year, which is tragic by any standard,'' he said. ``But if
fatalities were still occurring at the 1980 rate, the death toll
would have been 17,000 higher. Both numbers are mind-boggling.''
   He credited the reduction in highway accidents to the crackdown
on drunken- and drugged-drivers, the greater use of seat belts and
new safety rules affecting trucks.
   Burnley said it was too early to say what effect the new 65 mph
speed limit on rural interstate highways was having on safety.

<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration and law enforcement
groups agreed Tuesday on compromise legislation to ban undetectable
plastic handguns, using an approach that has been staunchly opposed
by the National Rifle Association and its legislative supporters.
   Joseph A. Morris, director of the Justice Department's office of
liaison, said the proposed legislation would be sent to Congress
this week.
   The compromise represents a change in position for Attorney
General Edwin Meese III, who earlier endorsed the NRA approach.
Meese now believes that the compromise language is more
enforceable, Morris said.
   The approach to dealing with plastic guns _ which are not yet
being manufactured _ has generated the latest raging debate between
the NRA and handgun control groups.
   Gun control groups _ joined by police organizations _ have been
lobbying for a bill that would require a minimum standard of metal
in any gun, so that the weapon would trigger an alarm in today's
metal detectors.
   The NRA has supported a bill by Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho,
which would ban undetectable plastic weapons but would set no
minimum standard of metal. McClure's approach, however, says that
weapons must be detectable by existing magnetometers.
   After several rounds of high-powered lobbying, full-page
advertisements, fund-raising appeals and doomsday rhetoric by all
sides, the administration has adopted the minimum metallic standard
as the best approach.
   NRA officials were not immediately available for comment on
whether they would accept the new approach.
   But last year, the NRA said a bill sponsored by Sen. Howard M.
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio _ which included a minimum metallic standard _
would make a number of small, existing handguns unlawful and amount
to ``the first federal gun ban bill in America.''
   Morris said no currently made guns would be barred under the
compromise standard, and said he hoped ``everyone can claim
victory.''
   Morris said neither the NRA nor the gun control groups were part
of the negotiations.
   McClure, commenting on the compromise, said he believes the
proposal brings all sides closer together, although he stopped
short of an endorsement.
   But he added that if the new language would not ban any existing
guns, there would be little substantive difference between the two
measures.
   ``What we were trying to make certain of is that this is a
detection bill and not a confiscation bill,'' McClure said.
   The senator said the NRA was aware of the new language, and
``reacted cautiously. They want to make certain we don't get into
the realm of confiscation of weapons owned by law-abiding
citizens,'' he said.
   The compromise was hammered out quietly by the Justice, Treasury
and Transportation departments and the Law Enforcement Steering
Committee, representing 11 of the nation's major law enforcement
groups.
   Meese said earlier this year that he backed the McClure bill.
But Morris declined to say that Meese had backtracked, commenting
instead that the attorney general ``will say, `Here's another route
that we think is optimal. We're not turning back on the McClure
bill. We think this is a better bill. It's more enforceable.'''
   Meese ``ordered a large in-house study on how detection works,''
Morris said, and administration experts accepted a metallic
standard of 3.7 ounces of stainless steel.
   That figure means any gun passing through a magnetometer must be
as detectable as one with 3.7 ounces of stainless steel. Such a
standard allows a weapon to have less metal or a different type of
metal, as long as the standard is met.
   The legislation does not specifically mention plastic guns, but
would ban any weapon that does not meet the standard.
   So far, Red Eye Arms of Winter Park, Fla., says it has a patent
for plastic weapons but won't start making such handguns for at
least two years, and then will only make them for military and
police use.
   Martha Plotkin, the chairperson of the Law Enforcement Steering
Committee, said the compromise was not aimed at opposing the NRA,
but at writing legislation that is ``workable and would protect the
public.''
   She said the NRA should be ``given an opportunity to look at
this without it being put to them as something they're not going to
like.''
   Metzenbaum, whose current bill has a slightly higher metallic
standard than the compromise, said he was ``pleased to hear the
Justice Department has listened to the very legitimate concerns of
the law enforcement community concerning undetectable weapons.
   ``From what we understand of the Justice proposal, it is fully
compatible with our legislation and I expect we will be able to
incorporate it,'' he said.
   His bill is co-sponsored by Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., who was
influential in bringing the law enforcement groups and the
administration together.
   In the House, the Judiciary subcommittee on crime has
unanimously approved a plastic gun bill sponsored by its chairman,
Rep. William J. Hughes, D-N.J.
   That measure, which went to the full Judiciary Committee, would
require that plastic guns have at least 3.7 ounces of metal _ but
has no provision that would allow lesser amounts of metal that
would also trigger the alarm.
   Hughes, asked about the compromise, said he prefers to use his
own bill as the vehicle for plastic gun legislation because it has
already begun moving through the House with bipartisan support.
   He added, however, ``I don't think there's any significant
difference,'' between the two proposals.

<HEAD>Brazil Hires U.S. Firm to Fight Oil Well Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Tuesday it has
hired the firm of U.S. oil-well firefighter Paul ``Red'' Adair to
put out a blaze at the country's largest offshore oil field.
   Carlos Pinto, spokesman for the government oil firm Petrobras,
said two employees of the Adair company, based in Houston, arrived
in Rio early Tuesday.
   He said they went directly to the Enchova oil field in the
Campos Basin, 120 miles east of Rio, where a fire has been burning
out of control at an offshore rig since Sunday.
   The Enchova field and four connected fields have been shut down,
cutting Brazil's oil production by 71,000 barrels a day. The
country's daily production is 615,000 barrels.
   Pinto said the fire started with a gas leak at an oil rig 50
miles off the coast and all 250 workers were evacuated unharmed.
   Four ships with water cannons sprayed the rig around the clock
to minimize damage but could not put out the blaze, according to
Pinto.
   ``There are two possibilities for putting out the fire,'' he
said. ``One is to dig a parallel well and draw off the oil and gas
feeding the fire. The other is the Americans' way, with an
explosion that uses up oxygen and kills the fire.''
   Petrobras plans to import an additional 60,000 barrels of oil a
day at a cost of about $1 million to cover most of the loss of
production from Enchova.
   ``The platform itself cost $330 million and is covered by
insurance. A few towers fell down, but apparently it will not be
destroyed by the fire,'' Pinto said.
   The Campos basin is Brazil's richest oil region and has produced
370,000 barrels daily. But Brazil still needs more oil, and imports
in the first quarter averaged 718,000 barrels per day.

<NOTE>EDS: UPDATES throughout to CORRECT that radio marriage proposal
not made Tuesday</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nine Soviet and four Canadian skiers arrived
Tuesday at the North Pole, their first major objective in an
attempt to become the first expedition to cross the Arctic on foot.
   ``Everybody is in great spirits, all hale and hearty,'' said
expedition radioman Tom Atkins in Toronto. ``It's a personal
victory. They're more than halfway.''
   Organizers revealed that wedding bells rather than jingle bells
were ringing for one jubilant skier as the group approached the
pole earlier this month.
   Max Buxton of Calabogie, Ontario, in a radio message relayed by
a Soviet air base in Siberia, asked his steady back home, Nancy
Burton: ``Will you marry me?''
   ``It's so much like Max, he has to do everything different,''
said Ms. Burton, a dental hygienist in Ottawa. Her answer, relayed
to Buxton, was yes.
   The team set out from the northernmost tip of Siberia on March 3
and hopes to complete the 1,100-mile trek through some of the
world's most hostile terrain by reaching Cape Columbia, on Canada's
Ellesmere Island, in early June. They arrived at the geographic
North Pole at 3:20 a.m. EDT Tuesday, the 55th day of their
adventure.
   Soviet explorer and folk hero Dmitri Shparo, Anglican priest
Laurie Dexter of Canada, and the other skiers planned two days of
rest before continuing the ``Polar Bridge'' expedition.
   From the pole, they sent a short radio message: ``The first span
of the bridge is complete.''
   The team seeks to become the first to make the transcontinental
trip across the Arctic without using vehicles or sled dogs.
   Bad weather prevented a group of Canadian dignitaries from
reaching the pole in time to welcome the skiers, Atkins said.
   Because of poor visibility at Alert, a refueling stop on the
northern tip of Ellesmere Island, the Canadians were stranded at
Eureka, 300 miles south. Their final destination was a floating
Soviet ice station within helicopter range of the North Pole,
Atkins said.
   He said a group of Soviet dignitaries, including former hockey
star Vladislav Tretiak, made it to the pole, where the temperature
was about 22 degrees below zero.
   Supplies were flown to the Soviet ice station Tuesday. Each
member of the expedition carries a 100-pound backpack with such
high-protein, high-fat food as bacon and dried fish to maintain
energy and body heat.
   The Soviet team has government sponsorship and the Canadians
found commercial backers. The Soviets proposed the expedition to
demonstrate benefits of world cooperation and peace.

<HEAD>Snow In Northern Plains; High Temperatures Across South</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A storm dumped more than a foot of wet snow on parts of the
northern Plains on Tuesday and sent temperatures plunging to record
lows, while parts of the Southwest and Florida basked in 90-degree
weather.
   Meanwhile, a cold front brought a showers to the upper Great
Lakes and into northwest Pennsylvania and western New York, and
showers hit eastern North Carolina.
   The snow showed no sign of abating as it moved from Nebraska and
South Dakota toward central and southern Wisconsin.
   The heaviest snow fell in South Dakota, with Custer and Black
Hills receiving 14 inches by Tuesday morning and Gregory getting 12
inches. Plainview, Neb. received 8 inches.
   Pipestone, Minn., got 7 inches, and a snow advisory was in
effect for the rest of southern Minnesota.
   Light rain covered central and eastern Iowa and extended into
southwest Wisconsin and northwest Illinois. The rain was expected
to change to snow over Wisconsin, with up to 6 inches expected.
   Record lows Tuesday included 11 degrees in Sheridan, Wyo.; 17 in
Havre, Mont.; and 35 in Paducah, Ky.
   By contrast, relatively sunny skies and warm temperatures
prevailed over much of Texas and up into the middle Mississippi
Valley. Highs reached the 80s and 90s across much of Texas, the
desert Southwest, the Gulf Coast and Florida.
   West Palm Beach, Fla., had a record-high 93 degrees.
   At 3 p.m. EDT, temperatures ranged from 30 degrees at
Yellowstone, Wyo., to 96 degrees at Fort Lauderdale, Fla. The
morning low was zero at Yellowstone, Wyo.
   Wednesday's forecast called for rain in much of the Midwest,
including Illinois, the Ohio Valley and lower Michigan, with rain
or snow expected for upper Michigan and Wisconsin, and along the
mid-Atlantic coast and New England; widely scattered rain and
thunderstorms from eastern Kentucky and Tennessee into the
Carolinas and Virginia; rain in coastal areas of northern
California and the Pacific Northwest; and mostly sunny skies over
most of the rest of the nation.
   Highs were expected to reach into the 40s in Michigan, Wisconsin
and the northern parts of Illinois and Indiana; the 70s and 80s
from the southern half of California to the southern Rockies and
from Texas to the south Atlantic states as far north as the
Carolinas; and in the 50s and 60s in much of the rest of the nation.

<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Following is a translation by The
Associated Press of the Saudi Arabian government's memorandum on
the rupture of ties with Iran:
   In view of the Iranian hostile attitude toward the kingdom of
Saudi Arabia, the premeditated offenses to basic Saudi interests
and as a result of the Iranian government attitude that runs
counter to the principles of international law and diplomatic
traditions;
   On account of Iran's violation of the principles of good
neighborliness and mutual respect, as exemplified in the attempt to
smuggle explosives into the Kingdom during the pilgrimage season of
the year 1406 (1986) to imperil the safety of pilgrims and the
sacred places;
   Because of Iran's manipulation of religious rituals and its
instigation of dissent and unrest among the sons of the Islamic
nation;
   Due to Iran's repeated attempts to harm the basic interests of
the kingdom, and its obstruction of free navigation by raiding
ships sailing to and from Saudi Arabia, in addition to other forms
of terrorism and subversion;
   The kingdom has resorted to the attitude of self-restraint and
prudence required between two neighboring Islamic countries. It
tried through various channels to explain to Iran that the kingdom
was eager to normalize relations on the basis of mutual respect:
   But the kingdom's positive stance gained no response whatever
from the Iranian side, which persisted in perpetrating hostile
practices;
   Foremost among these practices was the ransacking of the Tehran
embassy of (King Fahd) the custodian of the two holy shrines. One
Saudi diplomat was killed, embassy documents were looted and its
property destroyed in that attack. In addition, the Iranian
authorities had failed to provide adequate security for the embassy
personnel, who were perpetually harassed, forcing them all to leave
Tehran:
   Therefore, the government of Saudi Arabia decided to break its
ties with the Islamic Republic of Iran and asked all personnel of
the Iranian Embassy in Riyadh and consulate general in Jiddah to
leave the kingdom within a week.

<HEAD>Tough Principal Says Reagan Neglect Has Spurred Blacks To Better
Selves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTINE DONNELLY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan has denied opportunity to
blacks during his administration, but by doing so has spurred them
to improve their lives, a high school principal known for
unorthodox disciplinary tactics said Tuesday.
   ``Reagan has played a key role in the evolution of black
folks,'' Joe Clark told about 1,500 people gathered here for the
102nd Annual Convention of the American Newspaper Publishers
Association.
   ``What Ronald Reagan did was take the handout away from black
people and make us work for ourselves,'' he said, adding that the
result was massive voter registration by blacks.
   Tuesday was the second day of the three-day meeting. Later
Monday, NBC News commentator John Chancellor was scheduled to
address the convention, which has attracted newspaper executives
representing 90 percent of the daily newspaper circulation in the
United States.
   Clark, who is black, rose to prominence last year because of his
unorthodox methods of discipline at the primarily black,
3,000-student Eastside High School in Paterson, N.J.
   He told the mostly white audience that the U.S. welfare economy
had made blacks unproductive and decadent.
   ``We've lost a generation of black folks to drugs, we've lost a
generation to illegitimacy,'' he said.
   The way to reverse the decline is to provide role models, to
bring successful blacks back into the ghettos to provide
inspiration, he said.
   ``Where are the Dwight Goodens of science? Where are the Michael
Jordans of mathematics?'' Clark asked. ``They're out there,'' he
said, but must return regularly to the inner city to encourage
those left behind.
   Clark had a more physical solution for fighting crime.
   ``I think a few lynchings are in order,'' he said, adding that
the drug problem in the Unites States was so severe that sometimes
violence was the only answer.
   Such tough attitudes and his habit of carrying a baseball bat
through the halls of Eastside High have angered civil libertarians
and others who say Clark is all talk and little action. He counters
that he has the support of his students and their best interests in
mind.
   Clark's emotional and wildly applauded speech contrasted sharply
with a panel discussion on the status of minority workers that
preceded it.
   But the message was often the same: along with encouragement,
minorities need educational opportunities to help them compete in
the work world.
   Panelist Gerald Adolph, a principal with the New York management
consulting firm Booz, Allen & Hamilton Inc., said minorities and
women should be judged on their individual merits, not considered
universal representatives of their race, sex or culture.
   ``Judge people on their own merits and give them a chance to
succeed as individuals,'' he said.
   Adolph, who is black, advised minority applicants not to try to
fit into a white mold, but to ``emphasize our diversity. Try to
find companies that value our diversity.''
   David Lawrence Jr., the publisher and chairman of the Detroit
Free Press, moderated the discussion, which also included Roy
Roberts, General Motors Corp. vice president for personnel
administration and development; Barbara F. Cox, executive director
for human resources at U.S. West Business Resources Inc. of
Englewood, Colo.; and Daisy Chin-Lor, an area director of human
resources for Avon Products Inc.
   Lawrence said newspapers staffed predominantly by white males
risked ignoring the needs of many readers and becoming irrelevant
to them.
   ``It's hard for a newsroom full of white, male editors to fake
the insight you need to relate to a diverse community of readers
...,'' he said.
   Roberts said the economic survival of businesses, including
newspapers, depended on staff diversity.
   Companies ``that fail to consider minorities in their marketing
strategies ... will be the companies that lose the competitive
race,'' he said.
   Earlier Monday, Martin and Susan Tolchin, authors of ``Buying
into America: How Foreign Money is Changing the Face of Our
Nation,'' said foreigners were buying property and businesses all
over the country, without the federal government investigating the
long-term effects.
   ``Foreign investment is happening to us quicker than we can
absorb it,'' Ms. Tolchin said.

<HEAD>Attorney Claims State Department Made `Backroom Political Deal'</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The attorney for an American businessman who
claims the Soviet Union libeled him Tuesday criticized the filing
of a brief by the U.S. Justice Department in defense of the
Soviets' position.
   Attorney Jerry Kroll said he believes the U.S. State Department
has ``made a deal _ a backroom political deal'' with the Soviets to
avoid further conflict in the 3{-year-old case involving Raphael
Gregorian.
   ``They've swapped an American citizen's rights for what the
Soviets want,'' said Kroll, who seeks payment of both a libel
judgment and the cost of medical supplies which Gregorian sold to
Soviet hospitals before he was expelled from that country.
   ``Gregorian's life-saving medical equipment is being used in
hospitals in the Soviet Union and the American government is trying
to help the Soviets weasel out of paying,'' said Kroll. ``This case
has gone beyond being a simple trade case.''
   The Justice Department's legal brief, filed last week in the
U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, seeks to reopen a case which led
to an award to Gregorian for the loss of more than $200,000 worth
of medical supplies. Kroll, meanwhile, is seeking to reopen the
libel portion of the case, which was thrown out by U.S. District
Judge David Kenyon.
   Gregorian, of Palo Alto, did business in the Soviet Union for 14
years. He was operating a $10 million a year medical supply company
in Moscow when he was abruptly expelled in November 1984. Izvestia
printed an article alleging he was a spy and Gregorian decided to
sue.
   In the opening rounds of his litigation, Gregorian won by
default when the Soviets failed to come to court. But when Kroll
began seizing Soviet assets to satisfy the damage judgment, the
Soviets began to fight back, seeking a hearing in federal court.
   After long months of litigation, Kenyon reversed himself and
threw out the libel award, but the judge ruled that Gregorian must
be compensated for the medical supplies he left behind.
   The Justice Department's 49-page brief backs Kenyon's conclusion
that the Soviets should be immune from libel suits, and also argues
that they should be allowed to mount a full defense on the issue of
paying for medical supplies.
   In its brief and accompanying documents, the Justice Department
contended that the Gregorian case ``has become a significant issue
in bilateral United States-Soviet relations.''
   Kroll labeled that argument ``ridiculous.''
   ``We fail to see how forcing the Soviets to pay for medical
supplies will start World War III,'' the attorney said.
   Douglas Letter, an appellate staff attorney with the Justice
Department, said he would not comment further on the case or
Kroll's criticism. ``Our reaction is that we are not litigating the
case in the press,'' he said. ``Our position is stated in the
brief.''
   The Soviets submitted their own brief this week, stating points
similar to those raised by the Justice Department. It was filed by
New York attorney Martin Popper, who represents the Soviets in the
United States.
   A key issue raised by U.S. officials from the beginning of the
case was whether a successful libel suit against the Soviets in the
United States would leave U.S. citizens open to similar suits in
the Soviet Union.
   The Justice Department has offered this possibility as a reason
for their support of the Soviet position in the Gregorian case.

<TEXT>
   Soldiers and machines filled the
central square Tuesday, saluting a decade of Communist rule. The
parade also was a reminder of an equally long civil war the
regime's Soviet sponsors are about to abandon.
   Thousands of the 40,000 soldiers conscripted to defend the
government of Afghan leader Najib against Moslem guerrillas marched
past the leadership in a parade modeled on Red Square observances
of May Day and Revolution Day.
   Soldiers, workers and weapons coursed for more than two hours
through Ideghi Square after a night of unusually heavy rifle fire
and a guerrilla rocket strike in the hills east of the city.
Joining the parade were 10 T-62 tanks not previously known to be in
the Afghan arsenal.
   Najib led dozens of Afghan officials and a Soviet delegation to
the parade. About 500 guests and visiting journalists were
clustered under striped awnings on a reviewing stand.
   The senior Soviet official was Vladimir Orlov, head of the
Russian Republic's parliament. His minor rank appeared to reflect
the Kremlin desire for a low profile after agreeing this month to
start pulling its estimated 115,000 soldiers out of the country on
May 15.
   Yuri Sapounov, a Foreign Ministry official who accompanied
journalists from Moscow, denied suggestions that the Soviets were
snubbing celebrations of the April 1978 coup that brought
Communists to power.
   He acknowledged, however, that Soviet representation was a
contrast with a Politburo-level group that went to Addis Ababa in
1984 for the 10th anniversary of the Marxist government that
overthrew Emperor Haile Selassie.
   ``What is there to celebrate here?'' Sapounov asked. ``There is
a civil war going on.''
   A Moslem insurgency began immediately after the coup that ousted
President Mohammed Daoud a decade ago. More than 5 million Afghans
fled _ about one-third of the population _ most of them to
Afghanistan's neighbors on the east and west, Pakistan and Iran.
   Towns and refugee camps that house more than 3 million Afghans
just inside Pakistan serve as bases and supply points for the
insurgents, and the major guerrilla groups have their headquarters
in Pakistan.
   Despite a lukewarm show of Kremlin support for the Kabul
festivities, Najib's government followed the Soviet style from the
mass demonstration of worker support to taped chants and songs
blared across the parade ground through a scratchy public address
system.
   Platoons of soldiers with Soviet-supplied Kalashnikov assault
rifles parade-stepped past the leaders, over whom half a dozen
bodyguards with Uzi machine guns kept watch.
   After sunset, Afghan soldiers fired shots into the air during
private celebrations.
   Similar firing was heard Monday night but a member of the Afghan
State Committee for Peace, Solidarity and Friendship confirmed that
a loud explosion early Tuesday was a guerrilla rocket landing in
the eastern hills.
   ``It was especially noisy last night, perhaps because they (the
guerrillas) wanted to say something about the holiday,'' said the
official, who asked that his name not be used.
   On Monday, Najib proposed a withdrawal of government soldiers
from posts near the Pakistani border to create ``a non-military
line'' between the two countries. He said Afghan troops would leave
their positions if guerrillas and Pakistani soldiers did the same.
   The proposal seemed to be little more than a face-saving
admission of the difficulties the Afghan army has in fending off
guerrilla attacks.
   Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, head of the seven-party guerrilla alliance,
said Tuesday in Peshawar, Pakistan, the insurgents reject the idea
of such a zone.
   ``Afghan refugees will be reluctant to return even to those
areas that have been abandoned by the Soviet and Afghan troops,''
he told a news conference, and ``they want to be convinced that
peace has returned to afghanistan.''
   Soviet military forces entered Afghanistan in December 1979,
replaced one Communist government with another and remained to help
fight the insurgents.
   Najib became leader in May 1986, succeeding Babrak Karmal, who
is believed to be in the Soviet Union.
   On May 15, the Red Army is to begin leaving Afghanistan under a
U.N.-mediated accord signed April 15 in Geneva by Afghanistan and
Pakistan, and by the United States and Soviet Union as guarantors.
   The United States, China and several other countries have aided
Afghan guerrillas via Pakistan. Each superpower has reserved the
right to continue aid while the other does.
   Afghan insurgents were not direct parties to the Geeneva
agreement and say they will continue fighting.

<HEAD>Senators Request Ethics Review of SDI Research Contracts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES HANNAH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two senators Tuesday asked the head of the
Office of Government Ethics to determine whether any laws were
violated in the award of government research contracts to a company
with employees who served on a federal advisory committee.
   Sens. John Glenn, D-Ohio, and Carl Levin, D-Mich., said a recent
hearing by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee turned up
possible conflicts of interest.
   Those conflicts involved two members of the Eastport Group, an
eight-member panel that gives advice on computer and battle
management issues to the federal agency managing the nation's
``Star Wars'' missile defense program.
   Those two Eastport Group members, whose names were not
immediately available, are employed by Information Sciences
Institute, which has won two SDI contracts.
   In a letter to Frank Nebeker, director of the Office of
Government Ethics, Glenn and Levin said the two multimillion-dollar
contracts at issue pay for research directly related to
recommendations made by the Eastport Group.
   ``In fact, the first contract was based on an unsolicited
proposal by ISI, submitted within two weeks of the (committee)
report recommending such research,'' Glenn and Levin said in their
letter. ``Both contracts were awarded under questionable
circumstances.''
   When questioned about the contracts, the senators said, the
Defense Department ended the first contract earlier than planned
and announced it would reopen negotiations on the second.
   The senators said the Federal Advisory Committee Act requires
agencies to impose management controls on advisory committees and
that Defense Department conflict-of-interest rules require
committee members to follow certain ethical standards and file
financial disclosure forms.
   They asked Nebeker whether the committee members were subject to
federal standards of conduct at the time of the contract awards,
whether any laws or regulations governing ethical conduct were
violated and whether the matter should be referred to the Justice
Department for investigation.
   ISI is a research group affiliated with the University of
Southern California. Robert Biller, ISI's vice president for
external affairs, said the institute welcomes the review by the
Office of Government Ethics.
   ``We don't believe there is anything that represents an ethical
concern ... or a legal problem,'' said Biller. ``We believe
everyone has acted in good faith.''

<HEAD>Television Shows First Pictures of Ethnic Protests in Caucasus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet television broadcast film Tuesday of
chanting crowds of thousands in two Caucasus republics, the first
scenes it has shown of ethnic unrest two months ago that led to at
least 32 deaths.
   A 90-minute special about the trouble in Armenia and Azerbaijan
included criticism of the official press and appeared to be an
acknowledgment that reporting on the unrest was slow and
incomplete. The host was Genrikh Borovik, a journalist and head of
the Soviet Peace Committee.
   The show laid much of the blame for rioting on rumors, but also
indicated silence by the media did nothing to squelch the rumors.
   Such a program could not have been appeared before Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program of ``glasnost,'' or greater
openness. It was called ``Nagorno-Karabakh _ Reflection on Rumors''
and began with a woman from Yerevan, capital of Armenia,
criticizing lack of information from the media.
   ``I myself am not satisfied with the mass media, which
incorrectly reflected the events that took place in
Nagorno-Karabakh,'' said the woman, who was not identified.
``Central television also was silent about what happened there.''
   Borovik's broadcast, which preceded the main news program
Vremya, showed black-and-white film of thousands of chanting people
jamming open areas in Stepanakert, capital of the Nagorno-Karabakh
region of Azerbaijan.
   Signs visible in the crowd demanded that the region,
three-fourths of whose people are ethnic Armenians, be annexed to
Armenia. Nagorno-Karabakh was assigned to Azerbaijan in 1923.
   Protesters also demanded improved cultural and economic
conditions in Nagorno-Karabakh. Borovik did not reveal the origin
of the film.
   He said protests began in Nagorno-Karabakh in mid-February,
leading to demonstrations in Yerevan by hundreds of thousands of
people who heard rumors that protesting Armenians had been killed.
More demonstrations followed in Baku, capital of Azerbaijan, he
said.
   Soviet officials have rejected the demand that Nagorno-Karabakh
be annexed to Armenia, but offered a long-term program to improve
the area's economic and cultural life.
   About 15 minutes of film showed demonstrations in Stepanakert,
Yerevan and Baku. It also showed broken windows and damaged
buildings in Sumgait, the city in Azerbaijan where the deaths
occurred.
   The number of injured at Sumgait was given as 200, much higher
than the 81 reported April 13 by the newspaper Moscow News.
Officials told the program more than 80 people were under arrest on
charges of murder or participating in the ``massive disorder in
Sumgait.''
   Borovik criticized Sumgait officials for negligence and said
some lived in Baku rather than the city they governed. He did not
identify them, but the city Communist Party chief, mayor and police
chief were fired after the rioting.
   According to the program, 50 people were hurt in Agdan, a town
in Azerbaijan. Borovik said a criminal spread a rumor in Agdam that
a 12-year-old boy had been killed by Armenians in Stepanakert.
   A young man interviewed by Borovik in Yerevan criticized Soviet
media for not providing information sooner on those killed in the
ethnic rioting. Reports several weeks afterward said the dead were
26 Armenians and six Azerbaijanis.

   The drug Ritalin turned a difficult,
hyperactive 9-year-old boy into ``a zombie,'' the boy's parents
charged as they appealed to state school officials Tuesday not to
force him to take the medicine.
   Casey Jesson's parents appealed to a state education department
hearing officer, and said they will go to court if necessary to
override the Derry school district's order that he go back on drug
Ritalin, or another medication, before he is allowed back in his
third-grade class.
   ``We stopped the pills after my husband suggested that he should
get in the car with Casey and drive until they hit a wall,'' said
Casey's mother, Valerie. ``Life had become that much hell.
Everything was coming apart.''
   State school hearing officer Eric Falkenham did not indicate
when he would rule on the Jessons' appeal of the school district
requirement that he take the medication. The child is currently
being taught by a tutor provided by the school system, pending the
outcome of the hearing.
   Both sides agree Casey has serious behavior problems, but no one
has pinpointed the cause.
   With medication, Casey is manageable, school officials said in
testimony submitted earlier. Without it, they said, he is
disruptive and insults school officials, and refuses to follow the
simplest of classroom instructions.
   Outside the hearing, Derry School Superintendent David Brown
said that Casey's teacher sometimes had to call the principal to
the class to physically remove Casey from the room when he refused
to go out for lunch.
   Rachel Cobban, Casey's second-grade teacher, testified Tuesday
that when the boy quit taking Ritalin, he ``didn't stay in his seat
and pestered other children. I got no work from him.''
   ``He couldn't sit still even to do a five-minute reading task,''
she said, adding that Casey began having temper tantrums, tipped
over his desk and ate pencils and erasers.
   Ritalin is a stimulant, but paradoxically it can calm
hyperactive children, many experts say.
   Casey began taking Ritalin in the first grade when behavior
problems surfaced and continued taking it before school and during
the day for 18 months until the spring of last year.
   Off Ritalin, Casey has gained weight, sleeps better and looks
healthier, said his father, Michael. But he still does not know
right from wrong, has a very short attention span and, in general
is a ``bright but very trying child,'' Jesson said.
   On Ritalin, Casey looked and acted like a drug addict with
facial twitches, pale skin, little appetite and insomnia, his
parents said. He would sit for hours in front of the television and
rock back and forth, his mother said.
   Late in the afternoon, when the drug began to wear off, he would
begin to kick, scream, cry for hours, remain awake until after
midnight, refuse to eat, make repetitive animal noises and stare
transfixed at the faces he would make in a mirror, his parents said.
   ``He was a child in the driver's seat,'' said Mrs. Jesson. ``If
we had a good day, it was because Casey let us have a good day. He
was full of rage and it demanded our constant attention.''
   The Jessons rejected suggestions that they increase the amount
of Ritalin to keep Casey medicated at night. ``The stuff made him a
zombie. I couldn't do that to him,'' said Mrs. Jesson.
   The alternative to Ritalin is Cylert, which can cause an enzyme
buildup in the liver and would require Casey's blood to be checked
periodically, according to testimony from doctors who evaluated
Casey at Children's Hospital in Boston.
   Since taking Casey off Ritalin, the Jessons have experimented
with their son's diet, trying to see what food substances or
additives affect his behavior. Some experts have linked
hyperactivity to a child's diet.
   ``We know he craves sugar and feels better when amounts of it
are kept to the absolute minimum,'' said Mrs. Jesson.
   The Jessons have rejected the school district's proposal to put
Casey, provided he goes back on medication, in a program of
counseling and behavior therapy.
   His parents want the school district to offer Casey a
educational curriculum that includes counseling, behavior
modification, and more focus on the needs of hyperactive children,
such as special dietary needs _ but no medication.
   ``This kid had problems to begin with and then was blown apart
by Ritalin,'' said Mrs. Jesson. ``This family is through with
drugs. We need answers without drugs.''

   A paramedic was strapped a stretcher
Tuesday so he could continue trying to revive an accident victim as
the men were hoisted from the roof of a building to a helicopter.
   Construction worker V. Nelson Cruz was crushed against a wall by
a 25,000-pound crane counterbalance on the roof of a 13-story
building, said Deputy Fire Chief R.A. Gossett.
   Because the victim had suffered cardiac arrest, Tony Tozzi of
the Coral Gables Fire Department was strapped to the stretcher in a
kneeling position so he could continue to perform cardiopulmonary
resuscitation.
   Cruz was unconscious but breathing when paramedics started
working on him but was pronounced dead in the emergency room at
Jackson Memorial Hospital, Gossett said.

   Israeli troops tracked down Arab guerrillas
from Lebanon and fought them in rocky terrain and scrub brush just
inside Israel's northern border Tuesday. Two soldiers and all three
guerrillas were killed, Israel said.
   Two soldiers were wounded, one seriously with a bullet wound in
his chest, in the bloodiest border clash since Palestinian riots
broke out in the Israeli- occupied territories to the south on Dec.
8.
   The military command said Israel also deported six Palestinian
guerrillas on Tuesday. The army would not specify where the six
were taken, but neighboring Lebanon was the most likely destination.
   The army said the six were among 50 guerrillas of the Palestine
Liberation Organization's mainstream Fatah branch captured on Feb.
7, 1987. The 50 were aboard the small cargo ship Maria R, which
flew a Honduran flag and was seized midway in its journey from
Larnaca, Cyprus, to Lebanon.
   Arab guerrillas captured by Israel are usually sentenced to
prison terms in Israel. The Jewish state has expelled 20
Palestinians from the occupied territories since the unrest started
nearly five months ago.
   In the Gaza Strip, the army blocked hundreds of Palestinians
from reaching jobs in Israel by confiscating their ID cards and
requiring them to undergo checks at government offices.
   The government also temporarily revoked the press credentials of
two foreign journalists, Martin Fletcher of NBC News and Glenn
Frankel of The Washington Post, for failing to submit their
dispatches to military censorship.
   The border attack began before dawn when an Israeli patrol
discovered footprints northeast of the town of Kiriyat Shimona, an
army spokesman said.
   For hours, troops lit the skies with flares and searched for the
intruders, the spokesman said.
   The soldiers found the guerrillas about 200 yards inside the
border and fired.
   The guerrillas responded by hurling hand grenades and firing a
rocket, the spokesman said.
   Lebanese police said earlier that the attack occurred in
Lebanese territory near Kfar Shouba. But a Syrian-backed group that
participated in the firefight later said it occurred in Israel.
   A soldier involved in the clash said troops and guerrillas were
six feet away from each other when the fighting began.
   ``They were hiding on a deep slope inside a maze of trees,'' the
soldier, who would not give his name, told Israel radio. ``It was
not possible to see them. From inside the maze the terrorists
opened fire.''
   The army identified the dead soldiers as Lt. Col. Shmuel Adiv,
29, a battalion commander of the elite Givati infantry unit, and
Sgt. Ramzi Wahsh, 27, a Bedouin scout.
   Gen. Yossi Peled, head of northern command, identified the
guerrillas as Palestinians and said their target was civilian
settlements.
   Police spokesmen in Beirut said it was a seven-man guerrilla
ring belonging to two pro-Soviet groups, the Lebanese Communist
party and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine led by
George Habash.
   But Israel said there were only three infiltrators and an
Israeli military official told Israel radio that documents found on
them showed they belonged to the Syrian-backed Democratic Front for
the Liberation of Palestine led by Naif Hawatme.
   Later Tuesday, Hawatme's group said the attack occurred in
Israel and that 12 Israeli soldiers were killed.
   Both the Israeli army and Lebanese police said two Israeli
soldiers and three guerrillas were killed.
   In a communique, Hawatme's group said the attack was staged by
``Martyr Abu Jihad Wazir squad,'' referring to the PLO military
commander assassinated in Tunis April 16, apparently by Israeli
commandos.
   The communique claimed the fighting lasted from daybreak to
midafternoon and said heavy machine guns and grenades were used.
Earlier, a police spokesman said fighting broke out at 3:30 a.m.
and the ``fierce clash'' raged for about three hours.
   The incident marked the 11th infiltration or attempted
infiltration since Nov. 25, when a lone guerrilla landed a hang
glider in northern Israel and attacked a military base. He killed
six soldiers in a hail of grenades before being shot to death.
   Israeli officials have linked the attempts to the uprising in
the territories. According to U.N. figures, 173 Palestinians and
two Israelis have died since Dec. 8.
   In Gaza, Christine Dabagh, a spokeswoman for the United Nations
Relief and Works Agency, said the army had taken the ID cards of
hundreds of Gazans and had ordered them to report to three separate
offices to check if they owed money for taxes.
   The measures appeared aimed at breaking a tax boycott that has
been a tactic of the Palestinian uprising.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin was quoted as telling
parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that fighting
the uprising cost the army $257.5 million to date.

   The 8-year-old girl who hitched a ride with
her kite on an airplane has landed in a museum.
   A life-size photo of DeAndra Anrig of Dublin, along with the
12-foot kite itself, will become part of the Ripley's Believe It or
Not Museum on Fisherman's Wharf, her father, Brad Anrig, said
Monday.
   On Saturday, the Anrigs delivered their daughter's kite to the
museum, where manager Ian Iljas said it and full-size photo of
DeAndra would go on permanent display after museum is remodeled
later this year.
   ``They offered us $200. We countered with $1,000,'' Brad Anrig
said. ``They came back and said their limit was $500.''
   Last month, DeAndra was flying her hang glider-shaped kite at
Shoreline Park in Mountain View when an air ambulance headed to
Palo Alto Municipal Airport caught the kite's line, lifting DeAndra
10 feet into the air.
   DeAndra traveled about 100 feet, then let go when she saw she
was headed toward some trees. She was not seriously hurt.
   Since then, DeAndra has received attention from reporters and
gotten letters from all over the country.
   ``She handles it like an old pro,'' her father said.
   DeAndra and the owner of the kite, Steve Chase, will split the
money from Ripley's, her share going into a savings account, Anrig
said.
   Iljas could not confirm the amount the museum was paying. The
sale was handled out of Ripley's main office in Toronto, he said.

   Supporters of two rival presidential
candidates clashed in a provincial capital and police fired tear
gas to disperse the mob, officials said Tuesday. At least six
people were injured.
   Newspapers and radio stations reported one person was killed and
at least 10 were wounded by gunfire after fighting broke out in
Cuenca, 185 miles south of Quito, during a campaign visit Monday by
populist candidate Abdala Bucaram.
   Officials denied the reports of shooting, however.
   The clash in Cuenca, an Andean mountain capital and tourist
center, was the most violent in a series of scuffles so far in the
campaign. The presidential election is set for May 8.
   The chief administrator of Cuenca, Italo Ordonez, told The
Associated Press ``six or seven'' people were hurt in the fighting,
but there was no gunfire. He said witnesses confused the explosion
of tear gas canisters with gunshots.
   He said scores of Bucaram backers fought in the streets with
supporters of Rodrigo Borja, candidate of the Democratic Left Party.
   Borja was first and Bucaram, of the Roldosista Party, second in
a field of 10 candidates in the first round of voting Jan. 31. They
will compete in a runoff to succeed conservative President Leon
Febres Cordero, whose four-year term expires in August.
   Newspaper reports said police surrounded Bucaram and escorted
him to safety when fighting broke out at Cuenca. He was not injured.
   Bucaram's populist, anti-establishment rhetoric and the leftist
programs espoused by Borja have caused uncertainty in Ecuador over
what the winning candidate will do once in office.
   Rumors of a military coup have circulated for months.

   Democratic leaders put the brakes on a major
trade bill Tuesday, postponing a vote on final passage while they
scrambled for enough Republican support to override a threatened
presidential veto.
   Provisions that would limit export of Alaskan oil became a
critical stumbling block as leaders campaigned to line up enough
votes to make President Reagan think twice before reaching for his
veto pen.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., postponed until
Wednesday or possibly even Thursday a vote on the 1,000-page bill
Reagan opposes because it would require all but the smallest
employers to give notice of plant-closings and major layoffs.
   The delay gave Democratic leaders more time to beat the bushes
for Republican support.
   Reagan again signaled that he would veto the measure as it
stands, saying in a letter to Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan., that lawmakers should ``finish the trade bill process in a
way that serves America's interests _ not special interests.''
   The centerpiece of the bill would streamline the system under
which the United States imposes import restrictions to retaliate
against international trade violations and aid U.S. industries
threatened by stepped up foreign competition.
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said
he was searching for ways to take care of complaints from Alaska's
senators that the bill was too restrictive of their state's oil
exports.
   Party leaders figured that Democrats need 14 Republican votes to
demonstrate the two-thirds support needed to override a veto.
Bentsen did not tip his hand by offering a specific count. He again
said it was close.
   Both parties were bidding for support from Alaska's Republican
senators, Ted Stevens and Frank Murkowski, who reported themselves
incensed over the oil exports provision.
   ``This legislation discriminates very violently against my
state,'' Stevens told the Senate. ``It is a concept that I am
unable to accept.''
   Currently it is illegal to export any oil from the Alaska oil
pipeline, but the state does export about 4,000 barrels a day from
Cook Inlet.
   The trade bill would limit export of refined oil from a new
installation at Valdez to 70,000 barrels a day and 50 percent of
output. The limit would apply statewide and thus act as a cap on
any additional refineries built.
   Another provision would require that crude oil exports to Canada
of 50,000 barrels a day envisioned under a pending trade pact would
have to be transported first to some point in the lower 48 states,
presumably Seattle, before being sent back north of the border.
   Murkowski said it was unconstitutional to discriminate against
one state in legislation applying to the entire country.
   The crude oil provision had been sought by the maritime
industry, which currently transports the oil to West Coast ports
and would lose jobs if it were merely piped over the border to
Canada.
   Mark Murray, press secretary to Rep. Don Bonker, D-Wash., said
Bonker and other lawmakers had drawn the provision requiring
shipment of crude to the lower 48 states before export to Canada.
He said it merely echoed provisions already in the pending
U.S.-Canada free trade agreement.
   He said Bonker supported the provision because he feared
maritime unions would scuttle the free trade agreement without it
and because he was concerned about dwindling employment in the West
Coast maritime industry.
   ``It's a tempest in a teapot,'' he said. He said criticism of
the provision contained political overtones for Bonker, who is
currently running for a Senate seat against former GOP Sen. Slade
Gorton. ``This has a lot to do with Slade Gorton,'' Murray said.
   Bonker later met with Bentsen and Murkowski and issued a
statement afterward saying he believed it would be possible to
reach a compromise. He added: ``I don't think anybody in the House
or Senate wants to scuttle the entire bill on a single issue like
Alaska oil.''
   The provision requiring a stopoff in a West Coast port for
Alaska crude exports does appear in the U.S. free trade agreement,
confirmed Gary Holmes, a press aide to U.S. Trade Representative
Clayton K. Yeutter. He said it was placed in the pact at the urging
of maritime interests.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said he would vote against the bill.
He said the savings and loan industry in Texas and numerous other
industries would be crippled by the plant-closings provision.
   He acknowledged a political risk in opposing the bill because it
also calls for the repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil
companies _ a move favored by the Texas oil industry.

   The Florida Supreme Court granted a
stay of execution for convicted killer Raymond Robert Clark on
Tuesday about 20 hours before he was scheduled to die in the
electric chair.
   The justices offered no immediate reason for their decision.
   The reprieve was the second Clark had gained within the past
three months. The warrant was the third Clark had faced for the
1977 shooting of David Drake, 49, a kidnapped convenience store
clerk. He was convicted the same year.
   Clark, 46, drove Drake to a secluded area, told him to write a
$5,000 check payable to cash, then shot him twice in the head,
court records show.
   A co-defendant, Ty Johnson, was sentenced to 25 years in prison.

   Bands of young people set fire to
street barricades Tuesday after police prevented them from holding
anti-government rallies in mixed-race townships near Cape Town.
   A group of academic leaders held a news conference and issued a
statement denouncing security force actions during more than a week
of protests at township schools. ``Education cannot happen at
gunpoint,'' it said.
   Students in the townships are demanding the reinstatement of
activist teachers dismissed by the government, the release of
youths detained during protests and boycotts, and the lifting of
restrictions on political meetings.
   In at least three townships _ Athlone, Mitchell's Plain and
Bonteheuwel _ police blocked planned protest meetings Tuesday,
local reporters said.
   Several journalists were questioned by officers and ordered out
of the area under state-of-emergency regulations.
   There were unconfirmed reports that up to 20 youths were
detained.
   Last week, police sent letters to school principals saying
officers would be deployed on school grounds to enforce order if
disruptions continued. Some principals said they would close the
schools rather than allow security forces on the premises.
   At the news conference, student leaders, teachers and university
administrators accused security forces of ``provocative actions.''
   ``The security forces are effectively threatening to occupy
schools in the name of law and order,'' their statement said. ``The
response of the authorities is a recipe for chaos and
confrontation.''
   Among those signing the statement were Stuart Saunders, chief
administrator of the predominantly white University of Cape Town,
and Jakes Gerwel, administrator of the mainly mixed-race University
of the Western Cape.
   In other developments:
   _ The Weekly Mail, an anti-apartheid publication, received a
warning from Home Affairs Minister Stoffel Botha that it could soon
be closed for publishing material he considers subversive.
   Irwin Manoim, the newspaper's co-publisher, said the warning
meant Botha could act within three weeks to install an in-house
censor or close the paper for three months.
   The New Nation, another anti-apartheid newspaper, has been
closed for three months and several other publications have
received warnings from Botha. He has censorship authority under the
state of emergency imposed by the white-controlled government.
   _ Civil rights workers said the government has declared the
black township of Oukasie ``an emergency camp.'' The government is
trying to relocate the township's residents and thousands are
refusing to move.
   The civil rights workers of the Transvaal Rural Action Committee
said the emergency-camp designation meant that Oukasie, near the
northeastern city of Brits, was no longer governed by regular
municipal laws and could be abolished.
   About 5,000 Oukasie residents have complied with government
directions and moved to an area 15 miles away, but 8,000 have
defied the government and refused to leave.
   Opponents of the relocation said the government wants to
demolish Oukasie because of complaints from white residents in
Brits who say the township is too close to their neighborhoods.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
   South Africa's racial classifications include whites, blacks,
Asians and people of mixed race.

<HEAD>Pregnant Woman Views AIDS Records Under Court Order</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pregnant woman who suspects that the
father of her unborn child may have AIDS has been allowed to see
the man's medical records under a court order.
   Alison Tradup, 25, demanded the information in a suit she filed
here so she could decide whether to abort the 9-week-old fetus. On
April 22, Monroe Circuit Judge Ignatius Lester ordered the records
turned over to her.
   State Health and Rehabilitative Services officials complied
Monday in a closed hearing. Under the judge's order, Ms. Tradup
cannot reveal the contents of the records. Her lawyer said Ms.
Tradup had made her decision but would not reveal what it was.
   The suit names James Mayer, co-owner of the Key West landmark
Sloppy Joe's Bar, as the defendant. Mayer was hospitalized recently
with an undisclosed illness, and his wife died earlier this month
of causes that have been kept confidential by county officials.
   The suit said Mayer ``is reputed in the community to have the
AIDS virus, but has denied this to (Ms. Tradup) and refuses to give
(her) access to his medical records.''
   Ms. Tradup's attorney, Imogene Synon, said she was pleased with
the result of the court action, but wished Mayer had complied
voluntarily.
   She said Ms. Tradup's own AIDS test was negative and that an
AIDS test conducted on Mayer several weeks ago was negative.
However, Ms. Synon said, Ms. Tradup wanted to examine further
medical information.
   Mayer's attorney, Michael Halpern, said his client had no
objection to Ms. Tradup's access to the records, but he felt
compelled to defend the confidentiality of AIDS data.
   ``My client recognized that anybody who was tested for AIDS
would be faced with the same situation he was faced with,'' Halpern
said. ``The potential abuse is horrifying that his records could
turn up on the streets.''
   But Halpern called Lester's decision, ``a perfect balancing of
the plaintiff's right to know while protecting the defendant's
confidentiality.''

   Israeli legislators criticized police Tuesday
for failing to prevent a commuter bus hijacking in which three
Israeli nuclear workers were killed by Palestinian guerrillas last
month.
   Mordechai Virshubsky, a legislator from the left-wing Citizens'
Rights Movement, said the March 7 hijacking could have been
prevented and charged police with trying to conceal mistakes.
   Details of the police actions emerged after military censors
lifted the lid off what news media here called a ``police failure
in a security affair.''
   A three-man guerrilla squad that infiltrated from Egypt killed
three Israelis and wounded nine before being shot dead by a special
anti-terrorist police unit that stormed the bus in the southern
Negev desert.
   The guerrillas seized a military Renault-4 vehicle before
hijacking the bus carrying workers from the Dimona nuclear plant.
   Israel Radio said at the hub of ``the affair'' were three
Israeli policemen who were ordered to erect a roadblock on the
highway linking Dimona with the Negev's capital of Beersheva and
stop the Renault-4.
   It said one policeman fired at the guerrillas' car but missed. A
second policeman tried to fire but his Uzi submachine gun jammed.
   The third police officer did not fire at all because he was busy
erecting the roadblock, the radio said, adding that the guerrillas
passed through the barrier unharmed.
   ``At first they wanted to conceal all this from the public. They
made every effort so that it does not reach public knowledge,''
Virshubsky told the radio.
   Ran Cohen, a legislator of Virshubsky's movement, told army
radio the incident ``was not ... a catastrophe. But it was a
serious failure.''
   Israel Radio quoted police officials as saying ``the affair was
blown up and a simple technical breakdown presented as failure.''
It added that after the incident, instructions were given to issue
an M-14 rifle to every police patrol and check all weapons in the
police arsenal.
   Police Commissioner David Krauss told Israel Radio the police
had learned a lesson and no one should be put on trial.

   A civilian court ordered the
provisional release Tuesday of a former armed forces commander
charged with overseeing death squads, a judicial source said.
   Former Gen. Gustavo Alvarez Martinez, about 50, was put under
house arrest 10 days after he returned April 9 from four years of
exile in Miami.
   He led the armed forces and was considered the military
strongman from 1982 until the military expelled him in March 1984.
   Dishonorably discharged and stripped of his rank, he was charged
in 1984 in the disappearances of about 130 suspected leftists and
the killings of about 30 others.
   When he returned to Honduras, he said he was a born-again
Christian.
   Judge Saul Suazo Lara of the 1st Criminal Court released Alvarez
without bail but ordered him not to leave the country, said the
source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   On his return home, the former general said: ``If anyone thinks
they have evidence against me, let them take it to the courts. I
have found tranquility and fear nothing and no one except God.''
   Some subordinates may have kidnapped or killed suspected
subversives, he said, ``and now it's being placed at my feet.''
   Some legal experts said the Alvarez case would fall under an
amnesty ordered in late 1984.

<HEAD>Ortega Calls Extension of U.S. Embargo Criminal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RODOLFO GARCIA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega said Tuesday
that President Reagan's decision to extend the U.S. economic
embargo against Nicaragua reflected a criminal attitude.
   ``The embargo will not demoralize the Nicaraguan workers,''
Ortega told a group of laborers who are working to develop 26 wells
to improve the Managua area's water supply.
   ``Our response to the embargo is this production of more water
for the population of Managua,'' Ortega said.
   ``Here we have the results. The morality and conscience of the
workers is stronger than the criminal attitude of Reagan with all
his embargos.''
   Ortega said Reagan's statement that Nicaragua represented a
security threat to the United States was ``a ridiculous thing.''
Reagan ``has done this to justify his terrorist and aggressive
policy against the Nicaraguan people and workers,'' he added.
   In a statement sent to Congress on Monday, Reagan said, ``The
actions and policies of the government of Nicaragua continue to
pose an unusual and extroardinary threat to the national security
and foreign policy of the United States.''
   The embargo would have expired May 1. Reagan first ordered the
embargo in May 1985, cutting off all trade with the Central
American country and denying Nicaraguan airliners and flag vessels
access to the United States.
   The United States maintains diplomatic relations with
Nicaragua's leftist government but also has provided aid to rebels
fighting to overthrow Ortega's Sandinista government.
   On March 23 the rebels, known as Contras, and Sandinistas agreed
to a 60-day cease-fire that went into effect April 1. Under the
agreement the two sides are to negotiate a permanent truce. They
have held meetings this month in Managua.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet government said Tuesday the United
States and Pakistan would face international moral condemnation if
they violated the Geneva agreement on the civil war in Aghanistan.
   It also urged Pakistan to shut down Afghan guerrilla bases
inside that country.
   An official statement carried by the Tass news agency said
politicians and officials, who it did not identify, began making
``statements contradicting the letter and the spirit of the Geneva
accords'' immediately after they were signed April 14.
   ``Any deviation from the recorded accords can harm the cause of
the Afghan settlement and impair the moral prestige of a state that
breaks the obligation assumed before the whole world,'' it said.
   The United States, Pakistan, the Soviet Union and Afghanistan
signed the agreement, but Afghan rebel leaders did not.
   The statement carried by Tass said the Soviet Union will keep
its part of the agreement and will withdraw its soldiers from
Afghanistan. About 115,000 Soviet military personnel are thought to
be in the country.
   ``Their withdrawal will begin on May 15, 1988, and be completed
not later than Feb. 15, 1989,'' it said. ``Our country is waiting
for its sons who have helped a friendly neighboring nation that has
found itself in trouble.''
   ``The Soviet people will never forget their exploits and will
hold sacred the memory of those who have laid down their lives on
Afghan soil,'' it added.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to help the
Marxist government fight the anti-communist guerrillas.
   The statement denounced the rebels, saying their rejection of
the Geneva accords ``only shows that the sense of responsibility
for the destinies of their country and their people is lacking.''

<HEAD>Acreage Near Chernobyl Reactor To Be Planted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials have decided it is safe to cultivate
about 74,000 acres of land near the Chernobyl plant back two years
after the world's worst nuclear power accident, Tass said Tuesday.
   The Soviet news agency said in a report from Chernobyl that
radiation levels around the power plant in the Soviet Ukraine are
well within internationally accepted norms.
   In a separate report, Soviet television showed film of a
memorial gathering of relatives of those killed in the explosion
and fire at the plant's No. 4 reactor on April 26, 1986.
   At least 31 people were killed by the blast and the release of
radiation, and a cloud of radiactive material circled the Earth.
   Alexei Denisenko, deputy chairman of the Ukraine State
Agro-Industrial Committee, told Tass the land to be brought back
into cultivation lies within the 18-mile zone around the plant that
was evacuated after the accident.
   It said scientists are working in Pripyat, the former home of
49,000 people located three miles from the plant, to see if any
long-term damage was done to plant life.
   ``So far we have not detected any mutations or changes in the
chromosome systems of plants,'' said laboratory director Nikolai
Arkhipov. ``The research shows that the level of its contamination
with radionuclides does not exceed the international medical norm
for foodstuffs.''
   Tass said the radiation level near the plant's first reactor is
about 0.5 milliroentgen an hour, and about four milliroentgen near
the second reactor.
   A milliroentgen is one-thousandth of a roentgen, the standard
measure of ionizing radiation. Experts say exposure to 50 roentgens
or more per year is dangerous and 400 roentgens per year can be
fatal.
   The news agency said a power plant worker would have to stay on
the site for 50 years to receive the dosage of radiation considered
the maximum allowable by international standards.
   Soviet news media generally have given a positive picture of
work at the Chernobyl plant in a series of reports dedicated to the
anniversary of the accident.
   But on Sunday, the Communist Party newspaper Pravda blasted
sloppy repairs, drunkenness and nepotism at the plant. It said
managers there act ``as though there hasn't been an accident.''

   Sailors boarded the disabled submarine USS
Bonefish drifting off the Florida coast Tuesday and began testing
and pumping out what they said appeared to be toxic gases inside, a
Navy spokesman said.
   Earlier Tuesday, 19 of the 22 sailors injured in Sunday's
explosions and fire were discharged from a hospital in
Jacksonville, Fla.
   The five-man boarding crew planned to continue its work
throughout the night before any effort was made to enter the
submarine, said Lt. Fred Henney, a spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet
in Norfolk.
   ``Initial reports indicate the air contained high concentrations
of toxic gases,'' Henney said. He said he could not identify the
gas.
   ``They're pumping air through the ship to get the toxic gases to
leave,'' he said.
   The boarding crew did not enter the sub and had no report of the
condition inside the vessel and nothing further on the three
missing sailors.
   The Bonefish was submerged when the explosions and fire began
Sunday during a training exercise. The crew was able to get it to
the surface and the skipper ordered it evacuated because of heavy
smoke and toxic fumes.
   The frigate USS Carr and the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy,
both of which were on routine exercises with the Bonefish,
evacuated 89 of the 92 crew members.
   ``It was a very harrowing experience we went through out there,
Cmdr. Mike Wilson, skipper of the Bonefish, said on arriving in
Charleston, S.C., by plane with other injured sailors from the
Jacksonville hospital Tuesday.
   ``The acts of individual heroism by members of the crew of
getting people off that ship are just too numerous to mention,''
Wilson said. ``The crew's behavior speaks highly of the training
they went through and it was just phenomenal.''
   Lt. Cmdr. John Tull, public affairs officer at the Charleston
Naval Base, said Tuesday night that Wilson would have no further
comment because of the pending investigation of the incident.
   Earlier Tuesday, Navy salvage crews briefly boarded the Bonefish
to close an open hatch and prevent water from getting in the
vessel, but high winds and rough seas prevented them from beginning
testing.
   With winds of 21 knots, seas were running 6 to 8 feet and
washing over the deck, Henney said.
   ``The decision was to close the hatch to eliminate the chance of
water getting in,'' Henney said.
   A civilian submarine expert said the explosions and fire that
disabled the diesel-electric submarine were typical of such
pre-nuclear subs.
   ``It's the classic way the diesel-electric submarines go down
the tubes in peacetime,'' Norman Friedman, author of ``Submarine
Design and Development,'' said in a telephone interview from his
New York City home.
   In Washington, Adm. Carlisle A.H. Trost, chief of naval
operations and a former submariner, said the missing men may have
died at their posts.
   ``All three of those individuals ... were on watch in the ship's
control room and were last seen there,'' Trost said. ``So it may
well be that they simply ensured that everyone got clear and they
themselves didn't make it.''
   Friedman said the 30-year-old Bonefish, one of the Navy's last
remaining diesel-electric subs, was probably filled with toxic
chlorine gas released by fire in the forward battery compartment.
   Diesel-electric subs use diesel engines to turn the propeller
while cruising on the surface and to charge the batteries needed to
run electric motors that move the boat while submerged.
   ``The typical accident happens when hydrogen builds up in the
battery compartments while the sub is charging the batteries,''
Friedman said. ``A spark ignites the hydrogen _ and remember the
ship is full of electric motors _ and you have an explosion
followed by a fire and that fire produces the chlorine gas.''
   The Navy has refused to speculate on the cause of the explosions
and fire but confirmed a newspaper report that the first explosion
occurred while the ship was cruising at periscope depth.
   The Virginian-Pilot in Norfolk said the boat may have been
charging its batteries by using its snorkel to pull in fresh air to
run the diesels while running within 50 feet of the surface.
   According to Friedman, the last American diesel-electric sub
lost because of battery explosion was the USS Cochino, which went
down near Norway on Aug. 26, 1949. The crew was rescued.
   The frigate USS McCloy was on station with the abandoned
Bonefish and the USS Petrel arrived Monday with salvage crews from
Charleston, the submarine's home port.
   The salvage ship USS Hoist from the Little Creek Amphibious Base
in Norfolk arrived on the scene Tuesday, Henney said. The Hoist is
designed for towing disabled warships, he said.
   Of the 22 crew members injured, only two were expected to
require extended further treatment for smoke inhalation at the
Naval Hospital in Jacksonville, Fla.
   Lt.j.g. Edmund B. Collins, 34, of Forest Park, Ill., and Petty
Officer 1st Class Antone Silvia, 28, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., were
in serious but stable condition and improving, Henney said.
   Robert Silvia said Navy officials told him his son and Collins
``were the last ones down in the engine room trying to get everyone
out.''
   Petty Officer 1st Class Charless E. Evans, 29, of Madison,
Tenn., was listed in satisfactory condition and was being kept for
another day, according to hospital spokesman Nick Young.
   The other 19 were discharged Tuesday to return to Charleston,
said Lt. Cmdr. John Griffin.
   The missing sailors were identified as Lt. Ray Everts, 30, of
Naoma, W.Va.; Petty Officer 1st Class Robert W. Bordelon Jr., 39,
of Willis, Texas; and Petty Officer 3rd Class Marshall T. Lindgren,
21, of Pisgah Forest, N.C.

   U.N. officials are putting the finishing touches
on a return program for more than 5 million Afghan refugees,
potentially one of the biggest United Nations operations ever.
   The prospect of continued civil war in Afghanistan makes a swift
refugee return seem unlikely, but the world body is preparing for
several possibilities. Envoys of the Office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees have begun talks on repatriation with the
governments of the three countries involved _ Afghanistan, Pakistan
and Iran.
   Carrol Faubert, head of the Afghan repatriation unit at UNHCR,
said plans for returning the refugees are ``almost final _ and
provisional, of course, because we don't know when, how many and in
what time frame people will move.''
   ``We're trying to be ready for quick action if there is more
rapid movement than some expect,'' he added.
   Also, the refugee situation differs in Pakistan and in Iran, two
border nations harboring the displaced Afghans.
   Officials of various U.N. agencies will meet in New York
Thursday to distribute tasks in the repatriation, said UNHCR
sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar is expected to appoint a
special program coordinator shortly, as was done during the African
drought emergency.
   Perez de Cuellar told a news conference Tuesday that U.N.
observers will soon be deployed to monitor withdrawal of Soviet
troops from Afghanistan and a political settlement. He said the
Security Council authorized him to proceed with the U.N. mission.
``Our operation will be very much on in the next few days,'' he
said.
   Faubert said in an interview with The Associated Press that
UNHCR intends to supervise protection for the returnees, organize
transportation back to their place of origin, and oversee the
initial distribution of food, seeds and agricultural tools after
they return. A communications network to monitor the different
parts of the program must also be built.
   The effort is expected to cost hundreds of millions of dollars
if all Afghans return, U.N. refugee commissioner Jean-Pierre Hocke
has said.
   Perez de Cuellar is expected to launch an appeal for money soon.
   ``Our people are drawing up a number of scenarios that go from a
massive rush to people not moving very quickly. In Pakistan, there
are about 20 different scenarios,'' Faubert said.
   He said it is also difficult to predict whether the refugees
will return to several areas simultaneously or move region by
region.
   Apart from logistics, U.N. officials are evaluating what aid is
needed to rebuild roads and dwellings and restore land in
Afghanistan.
   More than a third of the population fled during 10 years of
civil war. Official figures list 3.1 million Afghan refugees in
Pakistan and 2.4 million in Iran.
   Under a U.N.-sponsored agreement signed April 14, the Soviet
Union pledged to withdraw its troops backing the Afghan government,
starting May 15. Afghanistan and Pakistan agreed to ensure the safe
and voluntary return of refugees.
   Not signing were Moslem Afghan guerrillas, who say they will
continue fighting to overthrow the communist Kabul government.
   UNHCR officials in Pakistan met with the resistance shortly
before the pact's conclusion, apparently aiming to draw them into
the repatriation plans. Faubert refused to reveal the outcome of
the talks but said they will continue.
   U.N. plans must also take into account the differences between
government policy and the composition of the refugee population in
Iran and Pakistan.
   Most Afghans in Pakistan are displaced farmers, housed in 320
refugee villages within about 60 miles of the border. They own
about 4,000 private trucks, so there could be sizeable,
unsupervised returns.
   In Iran, about 60 percent of the Afghan refugees are in cities
relatively far from the border. Many are said to have found menial
jobs. They may wait for years to return, Faubert said.
   Iran, which did not take part in the U.N. negotiations, and
Pakistan both pledge not to expel refugees. But Pakistani officials
make clear they would welcome a quick return home of the Afghans.
Many Pakistanis blame the refugees for a wide range of the
country's social and economic problems.

   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
announced Tuesday that U.N. observers will be deployed soon to
monitor withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan and a
political settlement.
   From 40 to 50 U.N. military observers are required under the
Afghan agreement signed in Geneva April 14. The nine countaries
named in the provisional list to provide observers are Canada,
Denmark, Fiji, Ghana, Ireland, Nepal, New Zealand, Poland and
Sweden.
   The estimated 115,000 Soviet troops in Afghanistan will begin
withdrawing on May 15, according to the Kremlin.
   Perez de Cuellar told a news conference the Security Council had
authorized him to proceed with the U.N. mission. ``Our operation
will be very much on in the next few days,'' he said.
   He said Undersecretary-General Diego Cordovez of Ecuador will be
his special representative on the settlement in Afghanistan.
   The secretary-general's envoy negotiated the agreement with
Pakistan and Afghanistan after acting as mediator for nearly seven
years.
   Afghan guerrilla leaders were not involved directly in the
Geneva negotiations and rejected the pact, vowing continued
warfare. The accords were signed by Afghanistan, Pakistan, America
and the Soviet Union.
   Assisting Cordovez will be Maj. Gen. Rauli Helminen of Finland
who now is in Islamabad, Pakistan, with Swedish aides. Cordovez
also will be aided by Benon Vahe Sevan of Cyprus as director and
senior political adviser.
   Besides military observers, the Afghan settlement calls for a
small civilian staff. The members will be divided into two
inspection teams in Islamabad and Kabul, the Afghan capital.
   They are to monitor the Soviet troop withdrawal, provisions for
return of Afghan refugees and other aspects of the Geneva
agreements.
   The U.N. chief told reporters the composition of the observer
team was under discussion and would be announced after Security
Council approval.
   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Soviet Union and the United States were debating the composition
from the East bloc and the West. They said the Soviets questioned
the participation of Denmark, Ireland and Canada and sought greater
representation from communist countries.
   Perez de Cuellar was asked how a small observer team of 40 to 50
men in the two capitals could successfully monitor the mass
movement of men and refugees without passports across a 1,400-mile
border.
   ``They will do their best, but they cannot go beyond their
mandate,'' he said, referring to the agreement that specifies small
units in the capitals of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
   In 1960, the United Nations sent 20,000 peacekeepers to the
Congo when Belgian troops withdrew and bloody conflicts ensued.
Perez de Cuellar was asked if a small team could keep peace in
Afghanistan, where many experts predict much bloodshed, factional
fighting among Afghan guerrilla groups and attacks on the Afghan
government.
   ``We will take decisions ... I can assure you that we will face
it if we have the necessary support of the Security Council and
member countries,'' he said. ``We have experience, but we do not
want to cross that bridge until we get to it.''
   Perez de Cuellar said Cordovez and his team ``will see if
something is going to happen ... but it (deployment of a larger
U.N. force) would be decided by the Security Council because we
cannot send troops into such a situation'' without approval.

   Michael Dukakis said his triumph in Tuesday's
Pennsylvania primary was ``a very big boost' toward the Dmeocratic
presidential nomination, but the Massachusets governor refused to
say he has won the battle.
   ``I'm going to campaign as hard as I can in the primaries
between now and June 7,'' Dukakis told reporters. ``I'm gong to
campaign in every single primary.''
   Dukakis said he was particularly pleased to win another big
state _ his fourth in a row _ in such a convincing fashion, racking
up a better than 2-1 margin over remaining rival Jesse Jackson.
   ``It's a very big boost....particuarly in a state that has been
a bellwether state in the general election,'' Dukakis added. ``It's
going to be very helpful.''
   Asked if the big win meant the nomination is now his, Dukakis
refused to claim the crown yet, refering to Democratic nominee
Walter Mondale's probelms in 1984.
   ``I reminded you several time that Fritz Mondale won New York
and Pennsylvania and then lost a string of primaries,'' he said.
   He said he would not change his campaign themes or strategy.
   `I'm going to keep it as strong and positive as I possibly
can,'' Dukakis said.
   The next round of contests comes next Tuesday, in Ohio, Indiana
and the District of Columbia. Dukakis was heading for Ohio on
Thursday.
   Earlier, Dukakis said Vice President George Bush has
flip-flopped on his pledge not to raise taxes. Bush won the
Republican primary in Pennsylvania, and the contest was expected to
yield enough delegates to give him a mathematical lock on the
nomination.
   Dukakis, bringing up the politically risky tax issue, said
Bush's pledge was a shaky one, like the claim by a comic opera
character that he never gets seasick _ ``What, Never? Hardly ever.''
   In recent days, Dukakis has been referring to Bush, his possible
November opponent, in answer to questions.
   Asked whether he would raise taxes, Dukakis gave his standard
answer:
   ``We've got to find new revenue. I don't think any responsible
candidate for the presidency can rule out new taxes. I can't make
that judgment at the present time.''
   Then he added:
   ``Even the vice president found that out. He announced on
Saturday (promising no new taxes) and then kind of like the captain
of the Pinafore, on Monday he said `Well, hardly ever,''' Dukakis
told the luncheon crowd.
   Dukakis was referring a line from the Gilbert and Sullivan
musical, ``HMS Pinafore.'' In the musical, the ship captain takes
part in this famous dialogue:
   ``And I'm never, never sick at sea.''
   ``What, never?''
   ``No, never!''
   ``What, never?''
   ``Hardly ever.''
   When Bush announced his campaign for the 1988 GOP nomination in
October 1987, he said, ``I am not going to raise your taxes.
Period.''
   But two days later, Bush said in an interview on the Cable News
Network that he might.
   ``What I have said is if I were convinced that all the spending
that could possibly be constrained or cut had taken place, then and
only then would I consider a tax increase,'' he said.
   Dukakis has been talking on the campaign trail about the giant
federal deficit and what he calls the ``fiscal mess'' the next
president will inherit from the Reagan administration. And this
mess exists even with recent tax increases, he said.
   ``The current administration has raised taxes three or four
times in six years,'' he said.

   George Bush has had a virtual lock on the
Republican presidential nomination since late March, but today's
Pennsylvania primary should make it a mathematical certainty.
   The contest, in which Bush only faces token opposition from
former television evangelist Pat Robertson, should raise his
delegate total to more than the 1,139 needed for nomination at the
GOP convention in August in New Orleans.
   Savoring the situation on the eve of that vote, Bush told an
airport rally in Scranton, Pa., on Monday: ``We got a break in this
primary process. ... I'm glad it's gone my way.''

   New declarations that the United States
doesn't want a ``serious shooting war'' with Iran come amid signs
that the Reagan administration is backing away from earlier
proposals to broaden the U.S. role in the Persian Gulf.
   The new suggestions by top administration officials come after a
week-long review of Persian Gulf policy triggered by the April 18
clash between the Navy and Iran, in which six Iranian ships were
damaged or sunk.
   Last week, U.S. officials had said the policy was under review,
specifically the rules of engagement which permitted the Navy only
to protect itself and 11 reflagged Kuwaiti tankers.

   ``But if someone wants to make an iron-clad guarantee that we

fear of any lingering ill effects from the October stock market
crash.
   The Commerce Department, in its first look at overall economic

business investment in more than four years and growing exports
kept the gross national product rising despite declines in
government spending and housing construction.
   ``So much for the recession that was supposed to occur in the

<HEAD>Raul Julia Only Saving Grace in `Onassis'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At one point in ABC's ``The Richest Man in the
World: The Story of Aristotle Onassis,'' Winston Churchill asks Ari
how he thinks history will remember him.
   Onassis demurs, but he could have predicted that he would be
immortalized in lame, exploitative made-for-TV movies to run in
sweeps months on American networks. This latest airs Sunday and
Monday.
   What starts as inconsequential pulp basically stays that way,
although, when Raul Julia takes over the title role late in the
first half, it threatens to become an interesting character study
of a powerful man who knew exactly what he wanted and just couldn't
quite get it.
   This is a sympathetic portrait of Onassis, as well as Maria
Callas, played by Jane Seymour. Jackie (Francesca Annis) and the
rest of the Kennedy clan come off as a bunch of money-grubbing ugly
Americans.
   The movie, based on the best-selling biography ``Ari,'' by Peter
Evans, isn't the first TV treatment of the Greek shipping magnate's
life.
   Anthony Quinn portrayed a character obviously based on Onassis
in the TV movie ``The Greek Tycoon'' several years ago. This time,
he plays Onassis' father, a thankless role that has him alternately
fuming and spouting fortune-cookie proverbs. Quinn's son, Lorenzo,
incidentally, plays Onassis' son, Alexander.
   Elias Koteas is adequate as the young Ari, though his role lasts
too long, and he doesn't in the least resemble Julia, whose droopy
eyelids and languid sensuality are perfect for playing Onassis, who
in real life wasn't exactly a matinee idol.
   The movie begins with Onassis as a youth in Turkey where his
father was a tobacco dealer. When the Turks begin rounding up
Greeks, attractive young Aristo avoids being sent to a labor camp
by having an affair with a Turkish colonel, no doubt with the words
of his father _ ``A wise man does what is necessary'' _ ringing in
his ears.
   But his father doesn't appreciate the way Aristo has won the
family's freedom, so Ari moves to Argentina where he sells
cigarettes and begins a habit of seducing opera stars.
   Julia shows up as Ari at 46, when he marries Tina (Beatie
Edney), the 17-year-old daughter of a shipping competitor (Anthony
Zerbe).
   Now the luscious trashiness begins in earnest.
   After having two children, Tina, who may be young but is not
stupid, notices her husband's philandering and leaves.
   Ari continues his pursuit of the volatile Callas while wining
and dining jet-setters like Lee Radziwill, and the powerful of the
world, including Churchill. Through Lee, he meets her sister, the
delicate wife of an up-and-coming U.S. senator. The short, stocky
Onassis probably would have been delighted at a yacht scene in
which Julia towers over the actor playing John F. Kennedy. Annis
plays Jackie as a symbol of respect, devoid of personality.
   After Kennedy is assassinated, Jackie, desperate for protection,
figures Onassis and his millions can provide it.
   Instead of marrying the tried-and-true Callas, Onassis opts for
symbolic triumph by wedding the world's most revered woman. His
children care for no one but their real mother and contemptuously
refer to her as ``the widow.''
   Jackie begins a spending spree that could put even Onassis in
the poorhouse, and she becomes enraged when photographers with
scuba equipment and long lenses are able to photograph her topless.
   Onassis goes back once again to Callas. He also repairs a
strained relationship with his son. But Alexander dies in a plane
crash, devastating Onassis.
   Shortly before he falls into ill health, Onassis bequeaths to
his daughter, Christina (Harriet Bagnell), his business secrets,
such as ``Write down everything, especially about people. When you
meet them again, you'll know how much time they're worth.''
   Too late for viewers, who will have already wasted almost four
hours on the miniseries.

<HEAD>Crises By Forecast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Every day since the stock market crash a
half-year ago, an economic crisis of one sort or another has been
forecast _ in trade, credit, stocks, bonds, car sales and more.
   Oddly, and offering a flash of insight about our times, none of
the ``crises'' has arrived. They fade quietly, no apologies from
their creators, and are replaced by vitally fresh hair-raisers.
   Are mortgage rates headed higher? Will the Federal Reserve clamp
down on the money supply? Can the dollar be saved?
   Economically speaking, the six months since the great stock
market crash have been unusually calm. The economy has neither
boomed nor busted. The jobless rate has trended lower. Securites
have been fairly stable.
   It has not been that way in the forecasts. Had they been right,
securities would be deeply depressed, unemployment would have
soared, home mortgages would have been unattainable, plants and
factories would be shutting down.
   In short, the economy as forecast would be in ruins.
   While forecasters suggest it is a miracle their worst estimates
haven't come true, it is equally amazing to others that some
forecasters won't give up. In almost every economic forecast there
remains a sense of punishment due. Good economic news is seldom
accepted for what it is; instead, it provokes forecasts of worse to
come. Poor economic news is almost welcomed.
   The contrast between forecast and performance is especially
obvious in the stock market, where it has become axiomatic that a
pervading bearishness in the forecasts indicates, of all things, a
higher market to come.
   Whatever the reasons, the persistent sense of fear in the
forecasts has created the impression that the past six months have
been ones of turmoil, whereas they have been closer to tranquillity.
   Why then do the fears linger?
   A sense of guilt, perhaps. If the stock market crashed why
shouldn't a recession follow?. Recessions almost always follow, so
why not now?
   A recognition that deep, and largely unresolved problems remain.
The trade and budget deficits, Third World loans, a high level of
credit at every level of the economy, the threat of trade wars, the
volatility of markets.
   But that doesn't fully explain why the good news is discounted.
   The economy, for example, has been neither strong nor weak, and
either one could cause trouble; inflation in one instance,
recession in the other. Jobs are being created. Inflation remains
in check. Interest rates, though edging higher, haven't been
jumping around as they once did. Exports are improving.
   Eventually there will be a recession, because if there is one
clearly demonstrable trait of economies is that they run in cycles.
Sooner or later expansions get out of hand, inflation begins,
recession ensues.
   While recession is viewed as an event to avoid, it can be argued
that it is necessary for clearing the way for the next expansion.
But to view it that way might be more than the human mind can
accept.
   No less acceptable, however, than the reign of terror in the
forecasts of things to come that destroy the calm of the present.

   The sound can still be heard in the city:
four or five voices working on a street corner, in a resonant

singing ``Get a Job,'' but it's never gone away.
   ``In the early '60s, this music was disappearing as a trend. But
for the past four or five years it's coming back as an underground
situation,'' said Stan Weaver, tenor with the Zip Codes.
   The hopping and bobbing doo-wop sound now turns up in
commercials for McDonalds, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Levi's blue
jeans. But Philadelphia's street corners can still attract some
harmony on a warm evening with a group of guys with nothing but a
pitch pipe to get started on the right key.
   Doo-wop was city music _ New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles _
and that's where it survives.
   In Philadelphia, Charlie Horner's ``Rhythm and Blues Show'' on
WXPN-FM keeps the flame alive. About 30 singers, who couldn't
afford instruments as teen-agers and don't want them now, were in
the studio recently to help Horner celebrate his 13th year on the
air.
   Horner travels 75 miles from his album-packed home in South
Bound Brook, N.J., to west Philadelphia to ``spin the sides'' every
Saturday afternoon.
   ``It's like having a a second job, but a good portion of my
paycheck goes into records,'' said Horner, a chemist.
   With tens of thousands of records stacked on the floor, couch
and tables of his New Jersey apartment, Horner has plenty of tunes
from which to choose.
   And with a man who spends every spare moment and all his spare
change on this music, don't call them oldies or nostalgia; they're
terms that make Horner wince. To him, these songs aren't locked in
the past, or symbols of a lost era.
   ``The type of music we play on the air is mostly from the '50s,
but that's just an accident of time,'' he said.
   Horner started in college as a deejay on Drexel University's
student-run radio station, then moved on to WXPN.
   He hasn't found any reason to leave a microphone that puts him
at the center of doo-wop singers and fans in Philadelphia.
   During his radio show, Horner fields telephone calls from
singers who recorded the 30- or 35-year-old records he plays.
   Occassionaly, he finds himself as the middleman in a reunion.
The Keystoners credit Horner with bringing the group back together
after 25 years of estrangement. Five years ago they sang in public
for the first time since 1958 and are back recording, hoping to
relive the success of their regional hit, ``Magic Kiss.''
   Most singers, though, realize doo-wop stands little chance of
ever being more than a hobby for them.
   ``You have to love to sing, because you're not going to get rich
off it,'' Horner said.
   ``We're looking forward to something very serious,'' said Harold
Shipman, baritone with Choice, a group that traveled from northern
New Jersey to sing live on Horner's show during the anniversary
special.
   While doo-wop bears the imprint of church choirs and of mellow
quartets such as the Mills Brothers, Horton says the specific
doo-wop sound can be traced to Sonny Til and the Orioles, whose
1948 hit, ``It's Too Soon to Know,'' inspired black teen-agers to
sing on the street corners, Horner said.
   ``He was to blacks what Frank Sinatra was to whites at the
time,'' Horner said.
   Til's group was among the first to use a wordless falsetto, with
other parts singing nonsensical syllables to round out the chord.
   Doo-wop legend has it that The Ravens' bass singer, Jimmy Ricks,
mistakenly started singing his part a few notes early one night,
drawing a gleeful and raucous response from the crowd at the Apollo
Theater in Harlem. The doo-wop bass lead was born. With Ricks
singing lead, the group scored a hit with ``Old Man River.''
   The Orioles' 1949 hit, ``Don't Tell Me So,'' reached No. 1 on
the rhythm and blues charts, while ``Crying in the Chapel'' hit No.
11 on the pop charts, making it one of the first R&B songs to cross
over into the white market.
   ``For black kids, it was something they heard all their lives.
It was white America that suddenly turned on to it in the
mid-'50s,'' Horner said.
   Horner isn't sure when it happened, but at some point he turned
from a fan to a historian of vocal harmony.
   With Karen Caplan, he is working on a book about the Delta
Rhythm Boys, whose style was more an extension of jazz than rhythm
and blues. The Delta Rhythm Boys went to Finland in 1960 when their
popularity in this country waned.
   ``The sad thing is, a lot of forms of American music, while they
have die-hard fans, need mass appeal. It's unfortunate a lot of
black musicians have to go to Europe,'' he said.
   Lee Gains of the Delta Rhythm Boys, ``probably one of the best
bass singers in the history of the planet'' in Horner's estimation,
died July 15, 1987. Seven days later, while singing a spiritual at
the funeral, Hugh Bryant suffered a fatal heart attack.
   With two members of the group dead, Horner is more determined to
chronicle the music and its influences.
   ``People may not appreciate it (the music) now, but might in
2050 and won't know anything about it. I'm trying to preserve the
history of this music before its lost,'' Horner said.

<HEAD>Prize For Moslem Leader Delayed For Inquiry At His Request</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Officials say the postponement in giving the
1988 Templeton Prize for progress in religion to Moslem leader
Inamullah Khan was at his request after some Jewish leaders accused
him of anti-Semitism.
   ``He himself asked for the delay so assurances could be given
that the charges were not valid,'' says the Rev. Wilbert Forker, of
Nassau, the Bahamas, vice president of the Templeton Foundation.
   ``Board members are now looking into it in this country and
abroad.'' He said the postponment was ordered April 5 and the
inquiry was not likely to be concluded until mid-summer.
   Charges that Khan was anti-Semitic came after he was named in
March to receive the $390,000 prize for advancing cooperation among
Moslems, Christians and Jews.
   It had been scheduled for presentation May 10 in London.
   Khan, 73, of Karachi, Pakistan, secretary-general of the World
Moslem Congress, said in a letter to the prize office:
   ``I request that the prize ceremony be delayed, if necessary for
several months, to allow full assurances to be given to the
Templeton judges and the public to clear away untruthful
accusations and misunderstandings.''
   The criticisms were raised by the Anti-Defamation League of
B'nai B'rith, which alleged past anti-Jewish comments by Moslem
Congress officers and in its newsletter.
   Khan says, ``The allegation that the World Moslem Congress ever
issued or mailed from its office any anti-Semitic literature is a
palpable falsehood.''
   He also said in a lengthy memorandum, answering questions
relayed to him by the New York Times:
   ``I can never support anti-Semitic feelings because I am myself
a decendant of Semitic ancestors from the Middle East...I respect
Jews as `People of the Book'; I respect Moses as a prophet of God.''
   However, mentioning a point that outrages Jews _ the United
Nations classifying of Zionism (Jewish nationalism) as racism _
Khan added:
   ``My difference is with the Zionists because the UN General
Assembly has declared Zionism a racist creed.''
   He also said the common Arab description of Israel as the
``Zionist entity'' has no significance. Jews, however,
overwhelmingly resent it.
   Noting that he is a president of the interfaith World Conference
of Religion and Peace, he said, ``I have consistently preached
inter-religious concord and understanding and promoted interfaith
meetings.''
   William P. Thompson, associate general secretary of the
interfaith conference, observed of the controversy:
   ``The prize is not because the winner is a saint but because he
has made some religious progress. Khan has made some remarkable
strides toward greater openness to other religions and respect for
them.''
   Khan had been accused by Abraham H. Foxman, national director of
the ADL, of denying Israel's right to exist. However, Khan said he
backs UN resolution 242, which supports a secure Israel, and also
Palestinian statehood.
   The New York Times said a Congress newsletter in the 1970's
advertised the ``Protocols of the Elders of Zion,'' a anti-Jewish
forgery, and carried other anti-Jewish tracts _ not mentioned in
questions to Khan.
   Foxman said Khan ``may have changed somewhat but not
sufficiently to set him up as a model of interreligious
understanding and reconciliation.''
   Particularly criticizing Khan's reference to Zionism as racism,
Foxman said, ``It reflects a mindset that hasn't changed that
much.''
   Jane Evans, a Jewish leader acquainted with Khan through the
interfaith conference, said he ``has kept open paths of
communication with other religions.''
   But she said he also has shown what Jews see as ``strongly
anti-Semitic views,'' by disparaging Zionism as distinct from
Judaism.
   He reflects a ``very difficult mixture of right and wrong,''
added Ms. Evans, executive director emeritus of the National
Federation of Temple Sisterhoods.
   Much of the criticism of Khan involved alleged Congress
newsletter items a decade or more ago. But Foxman also cited a
June, l986, item about a dinner Khan hosted for Chicago black
Moslem leader Louis Farrakhan.
   Farrakhan has called Judaism a ``dirty religion.''
   Foxman also criticized Khan for a 1985 letter of appreciation to
The Spotlight, a Washington, D.C., newsletter of the Liberty Lobby,
which Foxman describes as virulently anti-Jewish.
   Khan said his ``innocuous'' letter mentioned no religion.
   John Taylor of Geneva Switzerland, general secretary of the
World Conference on Religion and Peace, said the letter was merely
a courteous response to solicited comment.
   ``Almost identical letters were written by Jewish personalities
before knowing the anti-Semitic qualities of the publication,''
Taylor said in a telephone interview.
   ``Most of the accusations against Khan do not reflect personally
on him, but on the distant history of organizations and others...He
distances himself from these institutional aberrations.
   ``Khan has stuck his neck out in some very unfriendly climate to
build bridges of dialogue with Jews, Christians, Hindus and others.
He has risked unpopularity in his own circles to do it.''

<HEAD>The Most Comprehensive Look in 30 Years at the Mysterious Gauguin</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lurking among the canvases of langorous
Polynesian nudes in the National Gallery of Art's new exhibition of
the works of Paul Gauguin is a curious surprise, a wood carving
that tells much about the enigmatic French artist.
   It is an elaborate door frame that Gaugin sculpted from redwood
to decorate the entrance to the ``House of Pleasure,'' his
primitive hut on the remote Marquesan island of Hivaoa in the South
Seas where he spent the last three years of his life.
   Carved on both sides of the base, amid a tangle of nude figures,
tropical fruits, animals and leafy garlands, are the two simple
commandments that seemed to frame Gauguin's own scandalous life.
   Inscribed in French, one reads: ``Be amorous and you will be
happy.'' The other is ``Be mysterious.''
   They were obeyed with joyous abandon by Gauguin, who renounced
his family and his prosperous career as a Paris stockbroker to
pursue an artistic vision that led him to Denmark, Brittany,
Panama, Martinique, Tahiti and, finally, the Marquesas Islands,
where he died in 1903 at the age of 55.
   The art of Gauguin as the post-impressionist master and the
legend of Gauguin as the free-spirited libertine are inseparable in
the National Gallery's latest blockbuster, the first major
exhibition of Gauguin's works in nearly 30 years and the most
comprehensive ever held.
   The show, which took five years to assemble, opened Sunday for a
three-month engagement before traveling to the Art Institute of
Chicago, where it will be on view from Sept. 17 through Dec. 11,
and the Grand Palais in Paris, Jan. 10 through April 20 next year.
   Admission at the National Gallery is free, but passes are
required in anticipation of heavy crowds. The exhibition is
underwritten by American Telephone & Telegraph Co. in the United
States and by Olivetti in Paris.
   The curators focused on the depth and range of Gauguin's art
rather than the ``romantic mythology'' surrounding his remarkable
personal life. Gauguin's abstract images, flattened sense of space
and daring use of color, which he called ``a profound, mysterious
language, a language of the dream,'' clearly inspired Picasso,
Matisse and other 20th century modernists.
   ``You'll find Gauguin to be a fabulous and satisfying artist and
an enigmatic one,'' said Richard Brettell, director of the Dallas
Museum of Art and one of the principal curators of the exhibition.
   The 243 objects in the show include paintings, sculpture,
ceramics, prints and drawings on loan from museums and private
collections around the world, from Japan, Australia and South
America to Europe, the Middle East and the Soviet Union.
   Brettell said Soviet authorities were ``wonderfully
cooperative'' in lending 11 paintings from their country's Gauguin
collection _ the most important in the world.
   Many of the drawing and pictures, including the Soviet entries
from the Hermitage Museum at Leningrad and the Pushkin State Museum
of Fine Arts in Moscow, have never before been displayed in a major
exhibition, even in the slightly larger Gauguin memorial show that
his friends mounted in Paris in 1906.
   But Brettell said two of Gauguin's largest and most highly
prized paintings, which the curators ``wanted desperately'' for the
National Gallery show, will be absent because they are too fragile
to travel.
   Both painted in Tahiti in 1898, they are ``Rupe, rupe (Gathering
Fruit)'' at the Hermitage and ``Where do we come from? What are we?
Where are we going?'' which remains at the Boston Museum of Fine
Arts.
   A personal favorite of gallery director J. Carter Brown is ``The
Siesta,'' which is owned by American publisher Walter H. Annenberg
and has not been exhibited publicly for a quarter-century.
   Brettell and Charles F. Stuckey, curator of 20th century art at
the Art Institute of Chicago, flew to Tahiti to select two wood
carvings by Gauguin from a small museum bearing his name. One was a
bowl for eating poi, a fruit paste. The other was the missing
section of the decorative door frame which is housed in the Museum
d'Orsay in Paris.
   From Tahiti, the two curators chartered a two-engine
propeller-driven plane for a harrowing, seven-hour flight through
tropical storms at low altitudes across more than 900 miles of the
South Pacific to the Marquesas. Bretell calls them ``the most
remote islands on earth, the end of civilization in the tropics.''
   There they found Gauguin's burial site on the outskirts of a
village on Hivaoa, the artist's final refuge from the civilizing
influence of French bureaucrats and missionaries who had occupied
his beloved Tahiti.
   Gauguin, it seems, had carefully cultivated his popular image
even to the grave. The headstone he sculpted for himself was his
poetic image of an ancient Polynesian spirit called ``Oviri,''
which means ``savage.''

   Three health groups are asking the government
to begin regulating low-tar cigarettes on grounds that advertising
claims for the products make them a drug subject to federal
oversight.
   If accepted by the Food and Drug Administration, agreed to by
Congress and upheld in court, the arguments made by the three
groups on Monday would place the FDA in the ironic position of
regulating cigarettes low in tar and nicotine, but not other

   The Supreme Court has let stand an Arizona
telephone company's ban on sexually explicit dial-up message
services.
   In the first ``dial-a-porn'' case to reach the high court, the
justices without comment declined Monday to hear arguments that
Mountain Bell's refusal to carry sexually explicit message services
violates free-speech rights.
   The court's action came a week after Congress sent to President
Reagan a bill that would ban all dial-a-porn services, which are
available to callers through ``976'' exchanges and AT&T's ``900''
long-distance lines.

<HEAD>Stevens Agrees to $1.22 Billion Buyout By Pepperell, Others</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five generations of family operation will end
when West Point-Pepperell Inc. and its partners complete their
$1.22 billion buyout of textile giant J.P. Stevens & Co.
   Pepperell, which made its bid in conjunction with NTC Group,
announced Monday that it would pay $68.50 a share in cash for the
company, which has been run by Stevens family members for 175 years.
   The New York investment firm Odyssey Partners, Pepperell's rival
in the lengthy takeover contest, will purchase $530 million in
Stevens assets from Pepperell.
   Pepperell will keep most of Stevens' sheet and towel operations,
boosting its share of the home fashion textile market to 25
percent, analysts said. But about $170 million of those operations
will be sold to NTC subsidiary Bibb Co. to satisfy government
antitrust concerns.
   ``We would like to have (Stevens') bed and bath business, but we
were the ones who proposed what we would divest early on, so it's
no surprise, '' said Pepperell Chairman Joseph L. Lanier.
   Odyssey will get the company's other operations, including its
carpet and industrial fabrics plants.
   Pepperell and Odyssey went three rounds in a weeks-long, heated
auction before announcing last week they would work together to
draft a joint buyout proposal.
   Stevens initially rejected their $1.22 billion offer because of
concerns about the tentative nature of Odyssey's financing.
However, the terms were revised over the weekend to Stevens'
satisfaction.
   In the event that Pepperell cannot complete its end of the deal,
Odyssey has agreed to purchase Stevens, subject to financing.
Odyssey's outstanding $68.50-a-share tender offer has been extended
to May 20; Pepperell's offer at the same price will expire May 6,
unless extended.
   In trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, Stevens rose
25 cents to close at $67.75 a share.
   Pepperell's interest in Stevens has centered exclusively on the
company's sheet and towel operations, which include
state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities as well as top designer
brand names. Those operations account for 60 percent of Stevens'
$1.61 billion in annual sales.
   Stevens' towel and sheet lines include the brand names Ralph
Lauren, Laura Ashley, Gloria Vanderbilt, Perry Ellis, Pierre Cardin
and Givenchy, among others. Pepperell's brands include Arrow,
Martex, Lady Pepperell and Burberry.
   Should further antitrust concerns arise, the FTC has six months
to decide whether Pepperell must sell off a sheeting mill, a yarn
plant, certain designer licenses and a brand name.
   New York-based Stevens employs more than 23,000 people, mostly
in the southeastern United States.
   Pepperell's Lanier said he did not anticipate any layoffs at the
factory level, but said ``few, if any employees would be needed at
the corporate level.''
   Analysts agree that Stevens' factories are run efficiently and
are producing at near capacity, but that corporate employment is
bloated.
   Many observers were puzzled by Odyssey's aggressive interest in
Stevens. The ``greige goods,'' or unfinished fabric operations
Odyssey will acquire, are profitable, with sales of about $235
million last year.
   But the carpeting and industrial fabrics business, which had
flat 1987 sales of $334 million, competes against large, low-cost
producers in a cyclical industry, analysts noted.
   Partner Brian D. Young denied analysts' contentions that Odyssey
would be forced to cut employees.
   Odyssey's share includes 26 plants that employ over 9,000
workers with annual revenue topping $750 million. Pepperell will
acquire 15 plants, and Bibb will get eight plants. Further details
were not available.
   Stevens' own senior management headed by Chairman Whitney
Stevens, a fifth-generation member of the founding family, put the
company in play earlier this year with a leveraged buyout offer.
   Insiders say management, particularly Whitney Stevens, is upset
it will not play a role in the company after the takeover.
   ``It's not a happy day at Stevens' headquarters,'' said one
source close to the transaction.
   Meanwhile, representatives of the South Carolina and New York
attorneys general met here Monday to discuss their investigation
into whether the three companies, in combining their efforts to
acquire Stevens, violated any antitrust laws in determining what
price to pay.

<HEAD>Yields Rise on Short-Term T-Bills</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities rose in the government's latest auction, with yields on
six-month bills hitting the highest level in more than three months.
   The Treasury Department sold $6.4 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 5.92 percent on Monday, up from 5.78
percent last week. Another $6.4 billion was sold in six-month bills
at an average discount rate of 6.28 percent, up from 6.14 percent
last week.
   The rates on three-month bills were the highest since April 11,
when they sold for 5.98 percent. The rates on six-month bills were
the highest since Jan. 19, when rates averaged 6.37 percent.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 6.09 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,850.40 and 6.58 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,682.50.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield
for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making
changes in adjustable rate mortgages rose to 7.03 percent last week
from 6.92 percent the previous week.

<HEAD>Domestic Auto Makers Report Modest Mid-April Sales Increase</HEAD>

   Domestic auto sales rose slightly during
mid-April, although among the biggest automakers only Chrysler
Corp. recorded car sales gains in the period.
   Sales of U.S.-made cars and light trucks totaled 353,314 from
April 11-20, up from 308,240 a year earlier, a 1.9 percent gain in
daily sales, domestic automakers reported Monday.
   There were eight sales days in the period this year and nine
days in the period last year. The percentage changes compare
average daily sales, not straight totals.
   The daily sales rate for light trucks rose 3.2 percent, while
car sales rose 1.2 percent.
   Chrysler Corp. posted a 21.4 percent increase in car sales from
a soft performance in the year earlier period. Car sales declined
4.4 percent at General Motors Corp. and 2.6 percent at Ford Motor
Co. from strong mid-April 1987 periods.
   GM car sales totaled 112,344 in mid-April, compared with Ford's
65,626 and Chrysler's 33,842.
   ``I think that April is going to be a month in which you are
going to see auto sales go back to some sort of sustainable rate,''
said Jeanette Garretty, an industry analyst with Bank of America in
San Francisco.
   She said the easing sales were not surprising after automakers'
incentives kept sales brisker than expected for most of the first
quarter.
   Ray Windecker, an analyst at Ford, said sales incentives had
pushed industry sales to a 7.6 million seasonally adjusted annual
rate in April 1987, a year that ended up averaging a 7.1 million
rate. This year's mid-April sales were at a 7.5 million seasonally
adjusted annual rate.
   ``These are good substantial sales, against very strong sales
last year,'' Windecker said. ``It's differences in timing of
incentives more than anything else.''
   Among foreign manufacturers making cars in U.S. plants, American
Honda, which moved more production to the United States, sold
10,738 of its U.S.-made cars in the period, up from 6,488 a year
earlier.
   Nissan USA's sales of 2,950 U.S.-made cars represented a 19.3
percent drop in daily sales; Toyota sold 1,396, a 17.7 percent
increase; and Volkswagen sold 1,375, a 4.7 percent increase.
   Sales of imported cars and trucks are reported at the end of
each month.

<HEAD>Belo Reports 59 Percent Earnings Drop In First Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A.H. Belo Corp. said Monday its earnings declined
by 59 percent in the first quarter of 1988 from the same period
last year, due to higher operating costs and weak advertising
demand.
   The media company posted a profit of $896,000, or 9 cents per
share, on revenue of $87.3 million during the three months ended
March 31. That compared with earnings of $2.2 million, or 20 cents
per share on revenue of $87.5 million in first quarter 1987.
   Excluding revenue from two Denver radio stations sold in 1987,
first quarter revenue would have been up by $1.9 million from a
year earlier, Belo stated.
   The company attributed the profit decline to higher broadcast
programming costs, higher newsprint costs and weak advertising
demand.
   Belo owns The Dallas Morning News and Dallas-Fort Worth Suburban
Newspapers Inc., publisher of seven community newspapers. It also
owns and operates five network-affiliated television stations.
   The Dallas Morning News' publishing revenue dipped to $50.7
million from $50.9 million a year earlier due to a sharply lower
volume of advertising, Belo stated.
   Broadcasting revenue rose only slightly during the quarter, but
was up 6.1 percent if revenue from the divested radio stations was
excluded, the company said.

<HEAD>Boeing Profit Up 15 Percent In First Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boeing Co. said Monday its first quarter profit
rose by 15 percent from a year earlier, aided by reduced spending
on research, development and new business expenses.
   Boeing had net earnings of $136 million, or 89 cents a share, on
sales of $3.61 billion in the quarter ended March 31. That compared
with a profit of $118 million, or 76 cents a share, on sales of
$3.76 billion for the first quarter of 1987.
   Frank Shrontz, Boeing's chairman and chief execurive, said the
increase in first quarter profits was due primarily to lower levels
of research, development and other expenses for new commercial
jetliners, future military and space programs, and computer and
electronics work. A lower federal income tax rate and increases in
other income also helped, he said.
   Shrontz said the lower expenses were offset partly by higher
research, development and production costs for commuter aircraft,
performance problems on military aircraft work and a higher share
of costs on government contracts.
   During the first quarter, Boeing received orders for 129
commercial jets and six de Havilland turboprop planes, with a total
value of $4.7 billion. That compares with orders totaling $3.5
billion in first-quarter 1987.
   On Monday, Boeing announced a $1.4 billion order by
International Leisure Group, the parent company of Britain's Air
Europe, for 30 Boeing jetliners. That order includes 22 757-200s
and eight 737-400s, subject to the completion of financing, and was
scheduled for delivery beginning in 1989.
   Government and foreign military sales fell $200 million to $1.1
billion for the quarter, but Shrontz said military sales for the
year were expected to be slightly higher than in 1987.
   Boeing had a backlog of $38 billion in unfinished orders at the
end of the first quarter, up from $33.2 billion at the end of 1987.

<TEXT>
   The economy, shrugging off the effects of the October stock
market collapse, grew at a 2.3 percent annual rate in the first
three months of 1988, the government said today.
   It also said after-tax corporate profits rose an even faster 2.6
percent in the last three months of 1987. This was an upward
revision from a month ago, when the government put the increase in
business profits at 1.6 percent.
   A strong increase in consumer spending and the biggest surge in
business investment in more than four years fueled the gross
national product advance, the Commerce Department said, in its
first look at overall economic performance this year.
   The GNP report should put to rest any fears that the record
508-point drop in the stock market on Oct. 19 would topple the
country into a recession, economists said.
   In addition, the rate of inflation slowed, with a price measure
tied to the GNP rising at an annual rate of 2.4 percent, down from
a 2.7 percent increase in the fourth quarter.
   The reports came amid a continuing modest rebound in home sales
from a winter slump, a recovery experts say reflects a decline in
mortgage interest rates.
   Sales of existing homes edged up 2.5 percent last month, the
National Association of Realtors said Monday as it reported that
single-family homes sold at a seasonally adjusted rate of 3.33
million units.
   Despite the March rise, which followed a 2.5 percent increase in
February, the rate of sales remained 9.8 percent below that of
March 1987. The sales pace had dipped in November, December and
January after mortgage rates increased.
   Meanwhile, trading on financial markets was quiet as investors
awaited today's release of first quarter gross national product
figures, reflecting the economy's growth rate from January through
March.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed
22.21 points to 2,037.30. Trading was moderate.
   The dollar was mixed, and many dealers attributed the currency's
behavior partly to uncertainty about the GNP report. Bond prices
dipped, pushing interest rates higher.
   The home sales increase was expected to carry over into April,
said John A. Tuccillo, the realtors' chief economist.
   Mark Obrinsky, an economist with the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions, said interest rates likely would to rise slowly and
steadily this year, but predicted the rise would disrupt sales less
than the sharp jumps by interest rates in 1987.
   A year ago, 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages bottomed out at just
above 9 percent. They rose in spurts, topping 11.5 percent in early
October. Rates eased after the stock market crash, dipping just
below 10 percent in February and March before rising again to 10.3
percent last week.
   The March sales increase was accompanied by a 4.1 percent rise
in prices to a national median, or midpoint, of $88,700, from
$88,100 in February. Tuccillo predicted only modest increases for
the rest of the year.

<HEAD>Defense Argues Bank Policy, Not Scheme, Caused Continental Loan
Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's case against three men accused
of defrauding Continental Illinois National Bank is as shaky as a
broken three-legged stool, a defense attorney contends.
   ``If any leg is missing, it won't stand up, and at any point in
this case, one or more of the legs are missing.'' said attorney
Burck Bailey, who represents William Patterson, former head of oil
and gas lending at the failed Penn Square Bank of Oklahoma City.
   The government charged that Patterson joined with Tulsa oil
driller Jere Sturgis and another bank officer, John Lytle, in a
scheme to defraud the Chicago bank. The three men pleaded innocent
to charges of fraud and misapplication of funds.
   Closing arguments in the 6{-week trial before U.S. District
Judge Milton Shadur were expected to be completed today before the
case goes to the jury.
   In his closing argument Monday, Bailey contended that
Continental was saddled with troublesome oil and energy loans
because of an aggressive lending policy, not because of a fraud
scheme.
   Between July 1981 and 1982, when the alleged fraud scheme took
place, ``there was the widely held view that oil and gas prices
would rise so quickly that time would take care of any problems
with these loans,'' Bailey said.
   Lytle, a former Continental vice president, was accused of
taking kickbacks in exchange for funding high-risk energy loans
from Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co. to Penn Square
customers.
   The government also contended Lytle and Sturgis engaged in an
investment scheme in which Sturgis inflated the return on Lytle's
investment threefold so he could receive a favorable loan from
Continental. Sturgis never received the loan but made several
attempts, according to court records.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Ted Helwig portrayed Lytle, a 20-year
employee at Continental, as a bank officer who needed the money
because he was living well beyond his means.
   ``He had become so completely dependent on Bill Patterson, he no
longer had the interest of Continental first and foremost,'' Helwig
added.
   The indictment cited Lytle's involvement in $44 million in loans
made by Continental to 12 Penn Square customers. It did not say how
much was recovered by the Chicago bank, which came to the brink of
collapse in 1984 in part because of its troubled energy loans.
   The loans to customers of Penn Square, which failed in July
1982, were approved at about the same time Lytle received nearly
$600,000 in kickbacks from Patterson in the form of unsecured
personal loans from Penn Square, Helwig said.
   Lytle, impassive during government arguments, took notes Monday.
He sat facing the jury, wearing a brown suit and scuffed penny
loafers _ one with a hole in the sole.
   His attorney, James Streicker, noted that even when Continental
officials began reviewing Lytle's potential conflict-of-interest no
one told him to stop making loans to Penn Square customers.
   ``Because in spite of all the problems, Continental Bank wanted
the business,'' Streicker said.

<HEAD>Computer Giant May Sell Its Stake in MCI</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. may sell its 16 percent
chunk of MCI Communications Corp. back to the company over the next
several years, the head of the world's biggest computer company
said.
   The disclosure by IBM Chairman John F. Akers substantiated
earlier eports that MCI wants to repurchase the stake, which IBM
bought three years ago when the long-distance telecommunications
company was weaker than it is now. MCI's profit and revenue have
since risen significantly.
   Akers' statement also further weakened a theory that IBM's
original interest in MCI would lead to a major confrontation with
American Telephone & Telegraph Co., the long-distance phone giant
that also has been trying to develop a computer vending business.
   Since then, AT&T's performance in the computer market has been
considered disappointing, while IBM's attempts to develop its
telecommunications business also has been slow.
   Akers spoke in response to a shareholder question Monday at
IBM's annual meeting in Richmond, Va. He was asked about future
plans for the company's investment in MCI.
   ``We don't have any plans to increase our holdings with MCI,
although contractually they can ask us to, if they so desire,''
Akers said. He added that was unlikely because of MCI's desire to
repurchase the stock.
   ``I would expect that would come to pass and that will be the
action that you'll see over the next several years,'' Akers said.
   IBM initially made the investment, then valued at about $427
million, under an agreement whereby MCI acquired the assets of
Satellite Business Systems, a competing long-distance phone company
started by IBM in 1975.

   The stock market moved moderately higher today,
extending gains in the previous session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 20 points
on Monday, was up another 3.98 points at 2,041.28 after a half-hour
of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by nearly 2 to 1 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 613 up, 315 down and
525 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 20.18 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Before trading started, the government reported that the the
economy grew at a 2.3 percent annual rate in the first three months
of 1988.
   That was down from growth of 4.8 percent in the October-December
quarter, but the first-quarter growth figure was in line with most
pre-announcement forecasts.
   The Commerce Department said the first-quarter growth in the
gross national product was propelled by a strong increase in
consumer spending and the biggest surge in business investment in
more than four years.
   In addition, the government said the growth was accompanied by a
slowdown in the rate of inflation, with a price measure tied to the
GNP rising at an annual rate of 2.4 percent, down from a 2.7
percent increase in the fourth quarter.
   Among the actively-traded issues in the early going, Occidental
Petroleum was off [ at 27], Lucky Stores was up } at 54} and
American Telephone & Telegraph was unchanged at 27\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.33 to 148.54. At the American Stock Exchange, the composite
market index rose 0.60 to 299.55.
   On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 22.21 points
to 2,037.30.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 3 on the
NYSE, with 932 up, 584 down and 483 unchanged. Big Board volume
totaled 156.95 million shares, against 152.52 million in the

   OPEC is launching an effort to persuade
rival oil producers to help push up prices because the cartel is
convinced it can no longer control world oil markets by itself.
   Oil ministers from five of the 13 members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries meet tonight with representatives of
Mexico, China, Egypt and five other non-OPEC oil producers to
discuss possible production cuts.
   The meeting will mark the widest participation of non-cartel oil
exporters in direct talks with OPEC in history. But many industry
analysts say they see little chance of a firm accord this week on
joint output cuts.
   The OPEC ministers gathered at the cartel's headquarters in
central Vienna at midday today to lay the groundwork for the joint
meeting set for tonight.
   Rilwanu Lukman, the Nigerian oil minister and president of OPEC,
offered no details of the meeting's agenda as he entered the
building.
   ``We hope to have a good meeting, a useful meeting,'' he told
reporters. Other officials declined to comment.
   World oil prices have been falling as supplies exceed demand.
   Although the U.S. government was not represented, Kent Hance, a
member of the Texas Railroad Commission, was in Vienna to talk with
OPEC officials. The commission regulates that state's 2 million
barrels a day of oil production.
   Hance said in an interview today he had met with Fadhil Chalabi,
the OPEC deputy secretary general, and other members of the OPEC
staff on Monday.
   ``The main thing is to establish a dialogue'' with the OPEC
members, he said. ``The main message we'd like to get across is
stability'' for oil prices.
   The Texas economy has been severely hurt by the sharp decline in
oil prices over the past two years.
   Hance declined to be specific when asked whether he would
suggest to OPEC the possibility of Texas imposing restraints on oil
production in the state.
   But Platt's Oilgram News, a New York-based industry newsletter,
quoted him Tuesday as saying he ``couldn't make a deal on
production even if (he) wanted to,'' and that, in such a case, the
other two railroad commissioners and the Texas governor would have
to be consulted.
   ``The Saudis seem to be very much against any oil production
cuts,'' Graham Andrews, an analyst in the London office of the
investment firm Wood, Mackenzie and Co, said on Monday.
   He said in a telephone interview that one reason for the Saudi
reluctance may be to avoid allowing Iran to use increased revenues
from higher oil prices to strengthen its stand in the war against
Iraq. The Saudis indirectly support Irag in the war that began in
September 1980. On Sunday, Iranian naval gunboats attacked a
Saudi-owned tanker in the Persian Gulf.
   OPEC decided earlier this month to invite eight non-cartel oil
exporters to Vienna, saying a broader base of nations must bear the
burden of production restraint if prices are to return to OPEC's
declared target of $18 a barrel. Most OPEC oil is selling for at
least $2 a barrel less than the target price.
   The non-OPEC countries participating in the Vienna meeting are
Mexico, China, Egypt, Oman, Angola, Malaysia, Colombia and Brunei.
Their production totals about 8 million barrels a day, although
their combined exports are believed to be less than half that.
   In 1984 OPEC began inviting representatives of Mexico, Egypt and
other smaller producers to observe OPEC meetings. In March 1986 it
held direct negotiations with Mexico and four other independent
producers but no agreement was reached on production cuts.

<HEAD>Majority Backs Bid By Beazer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An investment group led by British
industrialist Brian Beazer says its $1.7 billion hostile takeover
bid for Koppers Co. has been backed by a majority of the cement
company's shareholders.
   BNS Inc., the takeover company Beazer formed with Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. and National Westminster Bank, disclosed Monday
that as of last Friday, 13.9 million of Koppers' common shares, or
53.4 percent, had been tendered in response to its $60-per-share
offer.
   If BNS were able to consummate its offer, those shares plus the
2.1 million BNS already holds, would give it 56.9 percent of
Koppers' stock.
   But BNS is barred by two federal court orders from actually
purchasing more shares unless and until legal challenges to its
offer are overturned.
   One of those challenges, which claims the takeover would violate
antitrust laws, will stand at least until May 13 when the federal
court in San Francisco hears an appear from BNS.
   Koppers declined to comment on Beazer's tally, but Koppers
spokesman Roger Beidler noted shareholders who have tendered their
shares can still withdraw them at any time before the BNS offer
expires.
   Koppers has said it is studying ways to financially restructure
in order to increase the value of its stock.

   Early contract negotiations between
Chrysler Corp. and the United Auto Workers have soured but remain
alive, despite a ``no-show'' protest by union representatives and
other frictions inside and outside of actual bargaining.
   UAW negotiators and union leaders scheduled to begin this week's
meetings with Chrysler on Monday morning instead met privately for
four hours and debated whether to continue the talks, said UAW
spokesman Bob Barbee.
   While Chrysler's team cooled its heels, union negotiators
discussed the rank-and-file's angry reaction to several
announcements last week _ such as disclosure of Chrysler chairman
Lee Iacocca's eight-figure wages for 1987 _ that seemed timed to
doom the talks.
   ``The talks may be in fatal trouble already but it's a little
too early to tell,'' said Harley Shaiken, labor and technology
expert at the University of California at San Diego.
   The union and the No. 3 automaker are negotiating a replacement
for a contract expiring Sept. 14. The contract covers at least
66,000 active and laid-off workers in 15 states and 65,000 retirees.
   Angering the rank and file were revelations of executive
compensation for 1987 that included nearly $18 million for Iacocca,
and the planned transfer of waning K-car production from two U.S.
plants to one in Mexico in 1989.
   The union will urge Chrysler to keep producing K-cars _ the
Dodge Aries and Plymouth Reliant _ at its Jefferson Avenue plant in
Detroit, said Marc Stepp, UAW vice president and head of the
union's Chrysler department.
   The Jefferson Avenue plant produces four-door K-cars while a
Toluca, Mexico factory produces two-door models.
   Chrysler is scheduled to move Omni and Horizon production from a
plant it is closing in Wisconsin to the Jefferson Avenue Plant this
summer and said last week it would consolidate K-car production in
Mexico.
   Stepp said union officials think the plant can produce both
cars. ``We would urge the corporation to change its plan,'' he said.
   At the bargaining table, talks that were supposed to last two to
three weeks as the two sides fit an industry-pattern contract to
Chrysler began to drag as Chrysler made proposals guaranteed to be
rejected.
   Chrysler Vice President Anthony St. John has publicly said he
will work within the job-protecting pattern contract already in
force at Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp., but union
officials say Chrysler bargainers are strongly resisting it.
   ``They have not come up with any pattern proposals. Chrysler's
first offer is garbage _ all take-aways. We're not going to take
any concessions,'' said Tony DeFrancesco, an official at UAW Local
624 in Syracuse, N.Y.
   DeFrancesco was among nearly 100 officials of local unions at
Chrysler plants nationwide who gathered in Huntsville, Ala.,
Thursday night and Friday. At the meeting, the local leaders heard
and booed company proposals and urged bargainers to break off
talks, according to DeFrancesco and others who attended.
   Chrysler spokesman Lloyd Northard said he still believed the two
sides would reach an early settlement, which had been intended to
mend their damaged relationship.
   Chrysler seeks a minimum age for early retirement instead of the
current ``30-and-out'' provision, which is the right to retire
after 30 years in the factory regardless of age. It wants workers
to take vacations only when plants are shut down, or lose them and
wants workers who don't join pre-paid health plans to pay $35 a
month in insurance fees.
   The automaker also wants widespread adoption of Japanese-style
plant work agreements at a time when some plants that have accepted
them are hitting snags in putting the so-called Modern Operating
Agreements into practice.
   Workers who made deep sacrifices that helped save Chrysler in
the early 1980s expected a return to normality once Chrysler
returned to profitability. Instead, Chrysler early this year
announced plans to close a 5,500-worker former American Motors
Corp. assembly plant in Kenosha, Wis., that it had said would stay
open at least five more years.
   Chrysler's later attempt to sell its 28,000-worker Acustar Inc.
met with strike threats and other strong union opposition.

   The U.S. economy, shrugging off the effects of
the October stock market collapse, grew at a respectable 2.3
percent annual rate in the first three months of 1988, the
government said today.
   The Commerce Department, issuing its first look at overall
economic performance this year, said the increase in the gross
national product was propelled by a strong increase in consumer
spending and the biggest surge in business investment in more than
four years.
   Economists said the balanced growth was good news for
Republicans in an election year and should bury lingering fears
that the 508-point drop in the stock market on Oct. 19 would topple
the country into a recession.
   ``This report presents a good, healthy picture of the U.S.
economy in the first quarter, nothing near a recession despite all
the earlier worries,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the
Boston Co. ``This is good political reading for the Republicans.''
   The administration wasted no time in boasting about the GNP
report.
   ``So much for the recession that was supposed to occur in the
first quarter,'' Commerce Under Secretary Robert Ortner said at a
briefing for reporters. ``Today's report shows the economy entering
its sixth year of expansion with inflation remaining moderate.''
   In further good news, the growth was accompanied by a slowdown
in the rate of inflation, with a price measure tied to the GNP
rising at an annual rate of 2.4 percent, down from a 2.7 percent
increase in the fourth quarter. This slowdown should help allay
fears that stronger consumer demand would push up prices and force
the Federal Reserve Board to raise interest rates to cool off
demand.
   The GNP grew at a much faster 4.8 percent rate in the
October-December quarter, but analysts said that growth masked some
dangerous imbalances that were not present in the first quarter
report.
   Almost all of the fourth quarter increase in GNP wound up as
unsold inventory sitting on shelves. At the same time, consumer
spending was taking a rare nose dive, falling by 2.5 percent, the
biggest drop in seven years. This combination has in the past been
a harbinger of a recession.
   This pattern was reversed in the first quarter with business
inventories, which had risen by $39.4 billion in the fourth
quarter, falling by $13.2 billion in the first quarter, indicating
a success by businesses in reducing swollen inventories.
   Much of the success in working down the inventory bulge occurred
in auto showrooms, as dealers were aided by a new round of sales
incentives.
   This helped boost consumer spending by $23.6 billion in the
first quarter, a 3.8 percent annual rate of increase. The report
said more than half of that growth came in auto sales.
   Business investment for capital equipment shot up at an annual
rate of 32.5 percent in the first quarter, the fastest advance
since a 39.5 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 1983.
   In other good news, the country's trade deficit, after removing
the effects of inflation, narrowed by $3.6 billion in the first
quarter, continuing the trend of improvement that began in mid-1986.
   The administration, which is forecasting that GNP will grow 2.9
percent for the full year, is counting on further improvements in
the trade deficit to supply almost half of GNP growth this year.
   Much of the rest of the increase is expected to come from higher
business capital spending as companies expand production facilities
to meet a growing export demand.
   Both of those trends were evident in today's GNP report,
providing good news for the Reagan administration, which is
counting on a sixth straight year of economic growth to boost
chances for a Republican presidential win in November.
   In another report, the government said that after-tax corporate
profits rose an even faster 2.6 percent in the final three months
of 1987. This was an upward revision from a month ago, when the
government put the increase in business profits at 1.6 percent.
   Two factors that held back GNP growth in the first quarter were
a 9.4 percent drop in residential construction spending and a 22.3
percent drop in spending by the federal government, reflecting in
large part a swing in farm subsidy payments.
   The various changes pushed the GNP, after adjusting for
inflation, up by $21.8 billion, to a new annual rate of $3.90
trillion.
   The first quarter growth was welcome news when compared to
forecasts being made at the beginning of the year. At the time,
some analysts were actually predicting that the GNP would decline
in the first quarter, signalling the start of a new recession.
   The pessimists believed that a combination of the shock to
consumer confidence from the stock market collapse and the huge
overhang of business inventories would severely depress economic
activity in the early part of this year.
   The fear was that after a loss of a trillion dollars in wealth,
nervous consumers would stop spending and manufacturers, caught
with huge inventories of unsold goods, would cut back on production
and lay off workers.
   But, those events did not occur. Instead of cutting back after
the market turmoil, employers actually boosted hiring. Since
October, an average of 362,000 new jobs have been added to the
economy each month, more than twice the size of the monthly gains
before the crash.
   The big gains in employment helped restore consumer confidence,
considered critical for the economy's health since consumer
spending accounts for two-thirds of economic activity.
   The Reagan administration is predicting that the GNP will expand
at a 2.9 percent annual rate this year, marking the third
consecutive year the economy has grown at this rate.
   This view is in line with the outlook of many private
forecasters as well. Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a Sedona, Ariz.
newsletter, said that its latest survey of 51 top economists found
a consensus forecast for growth of 2.7 percent this year, up
significantly from a 1.9 percent GNP estimate made in the month
following the market crash.

   That was down from growth of 4.8 percent in the October-December

January-March period.
   The report also said the rate of inflation had slowed, with a
price measure tied to the GNP rising at an annual rate of 2.4
percent, down from a 2.7 percent increase in the fourth quarter.
   Analysts said the report contained little that was unexpected,
and said it had little effect on the movement of stock prices.
   But by the same token, the report failed to dampen recent
expectations that the economy continues to show signs of strength
despite earlier fears that it would bog down after last October's
market crash.
   Stock prices have also benefitted in recent days from some
strong earnings reports.

<HEAD>Major Step Forward in Steel Casting Measured in Inches</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARL BOHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An industry that weighs its products by the
millions of tons and totals its sales in the billions of dollars is
measuring one of steelmaking's most promising technical
breakthroughs by the inch.
   ``The potential is there to shake up this industry,'' analyst
Charles Bradford of Merrill Lynch says of a machine that eliminates
several major steps in the shaping, or casting, of liquid steel
into slabs for further processing.
   Like other advances, thin-slab casting has the potential to
reduce production costs, including labor. It also gives minimills _
smaller scrap-melting steelmakers _ an opening to markets dominated
by the giant integrated companies that produce finished steel from
ore.
   The German firm SMS Schloemann-Siemag AG has developed a caster
that spits out a ribbon of steel two inches thick _ much thinner
than the 10-inch-thick strands produced by today's slab casters.
   The eight inches gained may not seem like much. But they're a
world of difference to anyone who ever had to hammer a thick hunk
of steel into a strip one-tenth of an inch thick or paid to have
that done by the thousands of tons per day as major steelmakers do
in conventional hot strip mills.
   Roughly half of all the steel produced in the United States
passes through hot strip mills, which convert thick slabs of metal
into thinner sheets that are used to make such things as car
fenders, office furniture and appliances.
   SMS says its thin-slab casting process was tested in Europe with
good results and offers savings in machinery, energy, time and
labor, all of which mean money.
   Nucor Corp. hopes to reap those savings at a new plant in
Crawfordsville, Ind., where SMS is preparing the first commercial
thin-slab caster for a production start next April.
   ``They've achieved things that people didn't expect them to,''
said Keith Kappmeyer, vice president of research and technology for
USX Corp.
   USX and Bethlehem Steel Corp. the nation's No. 1 and No. 3
steelmakers, respectively, aborted a $30 million, federally funded
development program after SMS announced its breakthrough more than
a year ago.
   ``We were scooped,'' he said.
   Kappmeyer said thin-slab casting has been an ambition of
steelmakers since the 19th century, when a patent for a similar
caster design was granted to Henry Bessemer, the English engineer
whose namesake furnace was the first high-tonnage steelmaking
process used by the industry.
   Until now, the thinnest slabs possible on a continuous caster
were six inches, with 10-inch slabs more common.
   ``People are struggling to get down ... to six inches. So to go
from 10 inches to two inches is enormous. It is an unknown
territory,,'' said Herbert Fastert, president of the German
company's Montvale, N.J.-based subsidiary, SMS Concast Inc.
   The limiting factor had been the caster's water-cooled copper
mold, which shapes the molten steel while cooling the surface
enough to hold the shape as the metal moves through continuously.
In conventional molds, the intake and output openings are the same
size.
   The ``ingenious idea'' that SMS engineers had was to use a
funnel-shaped mold and to put the steel through at faster rate, 250
inches per minute compared to 60 inches in conventional molds,
Fastert said.
   ``The principle is so simple people said it's crazy,'' he said.
``It is crazy to suggest you do it in a funnel, because when it
gets stuck in the funnel and you pull it out and it breaks, all
your steel will run out. You lose three or four tons of liquid
steel all over your equipment.
   ``If you do it fast enough, you can do what at slow speed you
could never achieve,'' Fastert said. ``I liken it to water skiiing.
If you don't have the courage to go fast, you'll never get out of
the water.''
   Nucor's interest in the new caster fits the style of the lean
and aggressive Charlotte, N.C., company, one of the efficient
minimill operators that helped rebuff cheap imports of concrete
reinforcing bar and other low-value products.
   ``We've always made an effort to use the latest technology,''
said Nucor Chairman Kenneth Iverson.
   The innovative caster will help Nucor break into the market for
flat-rolled steel sheet, which had been the province of integrated
companies whose excess capacity led to cut-throat competition
through most of this decade.
   ``When you go into a market that has overcapacity, you've got to
be prepared to push somebody else out,'' Iverson said. ``You've got
to have a competitive advantage.''
   The Crawfordsville, Ind., caster, Nucor's edge, will be coupled
with a streamlined mill to produce flat-rolled steel. The plant
will cost $230 million ``compared to a billion for an integrated
hot strip mill,'' he said.
   SMS says the quality of its thin-cast strip meets or beats
conventionally produced steel, and Iverson said he expects to lop
$50 to $75 off the average price of $400 per ton for strip.
   ``This is the first time that a minimill has been built for
flat-rolled products,'' Iverson said. ``There's just a whole group
of people who are looking at it and watching us.''
   The entry of a minimill operator into flat-rolled steel may not
faze some of the giants of the industry, but lesser competitors
could be challenged, analysts say.
   ``None of this is going to be a problem for the first few years,
but I know six people who want to buy the second'' SMS caster,
Bradford said.

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They're relatively young, they
wear jeans and support the anti-nuclear movement _ but swear their
new bank, the first of its kind in West Germany, will be as
financially sound as any other.
   Set to open Tuesday (May 2), the Oekobank _ or Ecology Bank _
will adhere to a new kind of political and environmental conscience.
   The Oekobank will support projects such as alternative energy
development, pesticide-free agriculture, and women's self-help
centers, but eschew investments linked with, for example, the arms
industry or South Africa.
   Dubbed the ``bankers in tennis shoes'' by the national press,
the informally dressed, leftist-oriented crew stresses it's still
adhering to traditional, profit-making goals.
   ``The main difference between the Oekobank and regular banks is
our stance on political and environmental issues. But our working
methods are the same,'' Oekobank spokesman Torsten Martin, 34, said.
   ``Good intentions are fine, but the numbers have to balance,''
Martin added, speaking in German.
   All nine staff members have years of bank or economics training
and experience behind them. Director Hans-Peter Schreiner, 40, has
served on the board of directors at two banks.
   The Oekobank is drawing considerable media attention, including
recent articles in leading newsmagazine Der Spiegel and the
conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper.
   ``The ecology bankers want a new type of money house that offers
customers a chance they wouldn't get in the big institutions,'' Der
Spiegel said in a March 21 article.
   The Frankfurt banking establishment, including the mighty
Deutsche Bank, has so far declined to comment publicly about the
upstart institution.
   ``The established banks certainly don't regard us as
competition,'' Schreiner said.
   The Oekobank, with about 7.7 million marks ($4.5 million) of
equity capital, will be a Lilliputian among financial institutions.
The Deutsche Bank, for example, has about 9.7 billion marks of
capital ($5.7 billion).
   The Oekobank's only office is located in the homey neighborhood
of North End, blocks away from the glittering towers of the
Deutsche Bank, Kommerzbank, and other giants in West Germany's
high-powered financial center.
   West Germany's overseeing body for banks, the Federal
Supervisory Office for Credit Institutions, gave the Oekobank its
final approval on March 7, but imposed several restrictions.
   The Oekobank, for example, will limit its credit volume to three
times the amount of its equity capital, although the law allows
banks to issue credit up to 18 times that amount, Martin said.
   Restrictions were necessary partly because the Oekobank has not
been accepted into a deposit protection fund, a fund among banks
which acts as a sort of insurance for bank customers.
   Several innovations will enable the Oekobank to put its
political and environmental ideals into practice, Martin said.
   One will allow customers to invest in savings certificates
linked to specific environmental or social causes.
   Another enables borrowers to form a guarantors' pool for loans.
For example, 10 people wishing to start a business could take out a
loan of 50,000 marks, each person guaranteeing 5,000.
   ``Many banks wouldn't spend the additional time needed to
administer such an arrangement,'' Martin said.
   The Oekobankers may prove there is a market gap in West Germany
for a bank with a liberal conscience.
   Enthusiasm for the environmentalist causes of the Greens Party,
for example, is still running strong, and thousands of protestors
regularly show up for nuclear disarmament demonstrations.
   But the ecology bankers say they are independent of political
parties, despite having regional Greens groups among their backers
and a ranking Social Democrat federal parliamentary deputy on the
board of directors.
   ``We're not a Greens party bank, or a bank only for liberals or
the little man,'' Martin said. ``Environmental destruction, the
arms build-up, and disasters like Chernobyl are affecting people of
all classes and political beliefs.''
   Oekobankers are also tapping into the ever-growing area of
``alternative'' businesses, a broad variety of companies often
headed by young entrepreneurs, and based on collective ownership.
   ``We'll be there for unconventional entrepreneurs whose ideas
are often rejected by established banks,'' Schreiner said.
   But the Oekobank will also help customers with non-political
causes such as car payments and home repairs, he said.

<DATELINE>MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This bustling city, the largest,
richest and most industrialized in northern Mexico, rode into the
20th century on a wave of suds from Carta Blanca, the beer that
made Monterrey famous.
   It's the granddaddy of all Mexican beers, a golden brew that
helped turn a small brewery into a major corporation and a sleepy
town into an industrial giant.
   Monterrey has come a long way since the fledgling Cuauhtemoc
Brewery first put a cap on a bottle of Carta Blanca nearly a
century ago.
   A sprawling city of 2.8 million people today, Monterrey had just
40,000 inhabitants and a few small factories in 1890 when a group
of local investors started the brewery, named for the last Aztec
emperor, Cuauhtemoc _ pronounced Cwow-tay'-moc.
   ``It was contagious,'' said the historian and author Israel
Cavazos. ``The enthusiasm to create other industries caught on.''
   The brewery's needs were large at the turn of the century and it
wasn't easy to get raw materials from Mexico City 600 miles to the
south or from the United States 150 miles north.
   Cuauhtemoc's directors created departments to manufacture the
raw materials: malt, glass to make bottles, tin for caps, paper for
labels, cardboard for cases.
   Those departments spawned seven incorporated industries that
later became catalysts for the major industrial conglomerates Visa,
Alfa and Vitro.
   ``The brewery was the cornerstone of Monterrey's industrial
development,'' said Jorge Montemayor, Cuauhtemoc's planning
director.
   The brewery, now a division of Visa, started operations with 72
workers in a house in what is now downtown Monterrey. It produced
1,500 bottles of Carta Blanca the first year.
   By 1987, Cuauhtemoc's seven breweries throughout Mexico had
4,409 employees producing about 1 billion quarts of beer each year.
   In addition to Carta Blanca, still one of Mexico's most popular
beers, Cuauhtemoc makes Tecate and Chihuahua beers, its
best-selling export products.
   Its premium Bohemia brand won first prize among 35 domestic and
foreign lager beers in a Los Angeles Times Magazine beer-tasting
contest last summer.
   If Cuauhtemoc launched what is known as the ``Monterrey
phenomenon'' _ the unique industrial development of a city so far
from the nation's capital _ it also led the way in social and
educational development programs for employees.
   Before the government created a federal medical program,
families of Cuauhtemoc employees were receiving free medical care
at company clinics. Before the federal government started low-cost
housing programs, the company was helping its employees build their
homes.
   In 1912 the brewery founded Monterrey's Cuauhtemoc Polytechnic
School, which offered primary level classes to employees' children
during the day and to workers at night. The Monterrey Technological
Institute, now one of Mexico's leading universities, developed from
the school.
   Today, the brewery also provides free dental care, low-interest
loans, savings programs and university scholarships. Its sports and
cultural center sponsors soccer teams and offers classes in
swimming, karate, singing, dancing and guitar.
   Erik Eduardo Larsen, whose grandfather came to Monterrey from
Denmark in the early 1930s to take a job at the Cuauhtemoc brewery,
is the third generation of Larsens to work here.
   ``The company doesn't think just about production. It's
concerned with people, too,'' said the 22-year-old systems analyst
whose father was Cuauhtemoc's production chief.
   ``It's like a family here,'' he said. ``And the pay is better
than at other companies.''
   Salaries for laborers start 30 percent higher than Monterrey's
daily minimum wage of 7,405 pesos, about $3.20.
   The current economic crisis, however, has been tough on the
local beer industry, and the brewery is operating at a loss.
   In 1983, the year after the crisis began, Cuauhtemoc's domestic
sales dropped by nearly 1.3 million cases as consumers watched
their salaries eaten up by soaring inflation.
   Last year, however, the brewery achieved pre-crisis production
levels and is negotiating with foreign creditors to restructure
debts while pushing exports to generate U.S. dollars.
   Although the immense popularity of Corona Extra beer in the
United States has made Cuauhtemoc's main competitor, the Modelo
brewery, even stronger, planning director Montemayor said his
company is reaping some benefits from it.
   ``Corona's success has helped us, too. It's made the American
consumer more aware of Mexican beer,'' he said.
   An aggressive sales and distribution campaign, coupled with a
new American thirst for Mexican beer, has helped Cuauhtemoc more
than double its exports sales since the economic crisis began.
   In 1987 Cuauhtemoc exported 4.7 million cases of beer,
generating $29.2 million.
   Cuauhtemoc, with 33 percent of the domestic beer market, is the
second largest of Mexico's three beer manufacturers after the
Modelo brewery.
   In 1985, the financially troubled Moctezuma brewery was acquired
by Visa's holding company Fomento Proa in an exchange of stock that
prevented Modelo from acquiring it and becoming a force too large
to deal with in the Mexican beer industry, said Montemayor.

<HEAD>Texaco Says 1st Quarter Earnings Doubled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc., the nation's third-largest oil
company, today announced that its first-quarter earnings rose by
105 percent compared with the same period last year.
   The White Plains, N.Y.-based company said it earned $242
million, or $1.00 per share, on $8.7 billion of revenue, vs. $118
million, or 49 cents per share, on $8.5 billion in 1987
first-quarter sales.
   The latest earnings included a $66 million gain on the sale of
Texaco's interest in an offshore Angola joint venture, as well as
$29 million gain on foreign currency transactions, which compared
with a $7 million loss in the same period last year, the company
said.
   It also included an increase of corporate and nonoperating
charges to $249 million from $100 million in the 1987 first quarter.
   That hike was due in part ``to the recognition in the 1987
quarter of $73 million in nonrecurring benefits relating to prior
years income tax adjustments,'' Texaco said.
   ``The legal and related costs associated with the bankruptcy
proceedings and the financing expenses incident to the company's
ultimate emergence from Chapter 11 also contributed to the increase
in corporate expenses,'' the company said.
   Otherwise, Texaco President James W. Kinnear said its
performance was helped by improved domestic refining and marketing
margins and strong petrochemical results.
   Slumping crude prices were offset by improved earnings from
natural gas operations due to settlement of certain take-or-pay
issues and higher natural gas sales prices and volumes, the company
said.
   Texaco emerged from Chapter 11 earlier this month in a
reorganization that included a $3 billion payment to Pennzoil Co.
to settle a $10.3 judgment held against Texaco by Pennzoil
resulting from a jury's decision that Texaco had improperly
interfered with a Pennzoil acquisition of part of Getty Oil Co.

   Grain and soybean futures prices opened slightly
lower today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Follow-through selling from Monday's lower close provided some
initial weakness across the board, and forecasts for rain in the
nation's midsection during the week ahead kept prices on the

<HEAD>Pilots Union Sues United Airlines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH SHOGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Airlines pilots are suing the airline, its
parent, Allegis Corp., and the Machinists union in an effort to
strike down contract provisions they say could block an employee
takeover of United.
   The lawsuit was filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Chicago
by the Airline Pilots Association, said Hank Krakowski, a union
spokesman.
   The suit challenges two provisions in a November agreement
between United and the Machinists union, Krakowski said.
   ``We want a judgment from the court to declare that these
provisions are illegal, so we can move forward in our attempts to
affect employee ownership of United Airlines,'' he said.
   One provision prohibits the union from participating in an
employee ownership plan unless the Machinists union agrees to the
terms.
   The other contested provision would give the Machinists the
option of receiving substantial pay increases, reopening their
contract or striking in the event of a change in control of Allegis.
   The pilots' lawsuit alleges that the provisions, called
``protective covenants,'' are part of an illegal campaign by United
directors to ``entrench themselves in office at the expense of
Allegis shareholders,'' the union stated.
   ``We haven't seen the suit so we have no comment,'' said United
spokesman Joe Hopkins.
   Dan Sheehy, another United spokesman, said the provisions
addressed in the suit are part of a three-year agreement between
the company and the union regarding work and wage rules.
   ``Details of it aren't for public consumption,'' he said.
   A spokesman for the Machinists union could not be reached for
comment Monday night.
   United pilots have been working toward an employee takeover for
about a year, but the Machinists union has opposed the plan.
   United pilots made an unsuccessful $4.5 billion bid for the
airline last April, opposing Allegis' diversification into a travel
services conglomerate. The offer led to a proxy fight by a New York
investor group, Coniston Partners, to unseat Allegis directors, and
Allegis Chairman Richard Ferris later resigned.
   Allegis directors agreed to sell the company's hotel and rental
car businesses and to drop the Allegis name as part of a $3.65
billion restructuring plan.

   The stock market moved broadly higher today, as
a new government report indicated the economy continues to show
some strength.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 20 points
on Monday, rose another 14.10 points to 2,050.07 by noon on Wall
Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 2 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 948 up, 368 down and
512 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 74.44 million shares as of
noontime compared with 87.93 million shares at the same point
Monday.
   Before trading started, the government reported that the the
economy grew at a 2.3 percent annual rate in the first three months
of 1988.
   That was down from growth of 4.8 percent in the October-December
quarter, but fell well within most forecasts.
   Charles Jensen, a technical analyst for MKI Securities Corp.,
said that even though the latest growth figure had been
anticipated, the market took some encouragement from it anyway.
   ``It wasn't too low to dim hopes that the economic recovery
would continue,'' he said.
   He also noted that the dollar and bond prices seem to have
stabilized in recent days, and said that has helped the psychology
of some stock investors.
   The market has also benefitted in recent days from some strong
corporate earnings reports.
   In its latest economic report, the government also said
inflation slowed, with a price measure tied to the GNP rising at an
annual rate of 2.4 percent, down from a 2.7 percent increase in the
fourth quarter.
   Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer for First Albany Corp.,
said that was a slower inflation rate than some analysts had
expected.
   But he said the stock market is less concerned about the recent
past than with the future and is already looking toward a report on
the Index of Leading Indicators scheduled for release later this
week.
   Among actively-traded issues on the NYSE, Texaco was off [ at
48], Tandem was up 1~ at 19[ and American Telephone & Telegraph was
off [ at 27[.

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was

   The number of Americans manufacturing things
for a living has fallen in this decade, although such areas as
transportation equipment, plastics and furniture are bucking the
trend, the Census Bureau reported Tuesday.
   Overall, employment in manufacturing businesses fell by 731,900
between 1982 and 1986, the bureau said.
   That represented a decline of 4 percent, to 17,086,200 workers,
according to preliminary statistics from the 1986 Annual Survey of
Manufactures.
   More recently, however, manufacturing employment has been
increasing as the devalued dollar boosts sale of U.S. goods abroad.
According to the Labor Department, manufacturing jobs rose by
400,000 between June 1987 and March 1988, a period not covered by
the Census Bureau's survey.
   Between 1982 and 1986, the hardest-hit sector was machinery
manufacturing, which lost 325,700 jobs. Imports were a major reason
for the 15 percent decline to 1,863,000 employees in businesses
making heavy industrial and construction machinery, said Kenneth
Hansen, a Census Bureau analyst.
   Another area affected by imported products in recent years _
apparel and textile products _ saw employment fall 14 percent to
1,016,500 in 1986. That represented a loss of 172,500 jobs, the
report said.
   Primary metal industries also suffered, losing 164,900 jobs to
fall to a total of 689,200 in 1986.
   Manufacture of leather goods saw a loss of 70,000 jobs,
representing a 35 percent decline to 1986 employment of 129,800.
   Tobacco products suffered a 20 percent job loss between 1982 and
1986, with employment falling to 46,100 in the continuation of a
20-year trend.
   On the positive side, companies making transportation equipment
added 173,600 workers over the period, an 11 percent increase to
1,769,500.
   Transportation equipment is a wide-ranging field including
aircraft, trucks and trailers, automobiles, ships, motor homes and
even some defense equipment such as missiles, Hansen said.
   Computer products have helped boost employment in electronic
industries slightly, the study showed. That area employed 1,941,400
people in 1986, up 26,900 from 1982.
   Printing and publishing added 84,400 people over the period and
wood products and furniture-making also showed growth.
   Nationally, while total employment in manufacturing fell between
1982 and 1986, payroll was up from $204.5 billion to $231.7 billion.
   Here is a rundown of industry groups, employment in 1986 and
change from 1982:
   _All industries: 17,086,200, down 731,900.
   Gainers:
   _Transportation equipment, 1,769,500, up 173,600.
   _Printing and publishing, 1,376,200, up 84,400.
   _Rubber and plastics products, 741,300, up 59,600.
   _Lumber and wood products, 619,500, up 43,100.
   _Furniture and fixtures, 466,700, up 30,700.
   _Electric and electronic equipment, 1,941,400, up 26,900.
   Losers:
   _Machinery, except electrical, 1,863,000, down 325,700.
   _Apparel and other textile products, 1,016,500, down 172,500.
   _Primary metal industries, 689,200, down 164,900.
   _Food and kindred products: 1,408,900, down 78,800.
   _Textile mill products, 644,300, down 73,100.
   _Chemicals and allied products, 801,600, down 71,000.
   _Leather and leather products, 129,800, down 70,000.
   _Miscellaneous manufacturing, 326,100, down 56,500.
   _Fabricated metal products, 1,419,500, down 40,200.
   _Instruments and related products, 585,400, down 38,200.
   _Petroleum and coal products, 124,500, down 27,100.
   _Stone, clay and glass products, 514,100, down 17,400.
   _Tobacco products, 46,100, down 11,800.

<TEXT>
   Southland Corp. said it plans to virtually halt
construction of new 7-Eleven convenience stores for the immediate
future and use operating cash to repay debt on the founding
family's leveraged buyout completed in December.
   The Dallas-based company, which is privately owned, revealed its
plan Monday in a corporate profile of the company.
   Southland's construction and acquisition program that added more
than 1,600 stores in the past three years should keep Southland the
nation's largest convenience store operator, a company spokeswoman
said.
   Despite the shift in strategy following the Thompson family's
$4.9 billion leveraged buyout, Southland will continue to operate
about 7,500 convenience stores in 1988, about 3,000 more than
closest competitor Circle K Corp. of Phoenix.
   Circle K earlier this month purchased 473 7-Eleven stores for
$162 million and bought 538 stores from the Charter Co.

already was bullish on takeover news.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed up
23.2 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,800.8.
   Volume was modest at 428.0 million shares, although up from the
307.1 million shares traded Monday.
   Swiss coffee and chocolate maker Nestle S.A.'s offer of 2.1
billion pounds, or $3.95 billion, for British confectioner Rowntree
PLC, dominated the market from start to finish.
   The $16.73-a-share price exceeds the $11.84 paid by Jacobs
Suchard S.A., another Swiss coffee and chocolate company, when it
increased its stake in Rowntree to 14.9 percent earlier this month
and said it was seeking a 25-percent holding.
   By the close, Rowntree was up around $3.31 to $17.45.
   The surge pulled other food stocks up with it.
   The market broadened its advance through the day, helped by the
rise in New York as London trading wound down.
   Only eight of the 100-share index stocks finished lower, while
77 finished higher, and the rest unchanged.

   The Washington Post Co. said Tuesday its
first-quarter profit soared from a year ago mainly because of a
huge gain on the sale of its cellular telephone operations in
Florida.
   The company said its profit rose to $144.8 million, or $11.25 a
share, in the quarter compared with $18.6 million, or $1.45 a
share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the quarter rose 7.7 percent to $321.2 million from
$298.4 million a year earlier.
   The latest results included a non-recurring, after-tax gain of
$115.7 million from the sale of the Florida cellular telephone
operations.
   Without that gain, the company said its first quarter results
would have risen 56.3 percent to $29.1 million, or $2.26 a share.
   Both newspaper division and television stations revenue were up
10 percent, the Post said. It said cable TV revenue increased 17
percent and Newsweek's first-quarter revenue was up by 4 percent.

   Stock prices extended their recent gains this
afternoon as traders appeared to take heart from the government's
latest economic report.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 20 points
on Monday, rose another 16.25 points to 2,052.22 with two hours
left in the session.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 2 to 1 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 958 up, 441 down and
499 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 104.72 million shares as of 2
p.m. on Wall Street compared with 121.87 million shares at the same
point Monday.
   Before trading started, the government reported that the the
economy grew at a 2.3 percent annual rate in the first three months
of 1988.
   That was down from growth of 4.8 percent in the October-December
quarter, but fell well within most forecasts.
   Charles Jensen, a technical analyst for MKI Securities Corp.,
said that even though the latest growth figure had been
anticipated, the market took some encouragement from it anyway.
   ``It wasn't too low to dim hopes that the economic recovery
would continue,'' he said.
   He also noted that the dollar and bond prices seem to have
stabilized in recent days, and said that has helped the psychology
of some stock investors.
   The market has also benefitted in recent days from some strong
corporate earnings reports.
   Among widely-held issues on the NYSE, Texaco was up [ at 48|,

<TEXT>
   British confectioner Rowntree PLC on Tuesday
rejected as ``unwelcome'' and inadequate a 2.1 billion-pound, or
$3.95 billion, takeover bid from Swiss coffee and chocolate giant
Nestle S.A.
   The $16.73-a-share price exceeds the $11.84 recently paid by
Jacobs Suchard S.A., another Swiss coffee and chocolate company,
when it increased its stake in Rowntree to 14.9 percent and said it
was seeking a 25-percent holding.
   Jacobs Suchard said it wouldn't launch a full bid for at least a
year unless another bidder emerged.
   Nestle said it already has acquired about 6.6 percent of
Rowntree's shares.
   But Rowntree recommended to its shareholders that they take no
action in regard to Nestle's offer, which it said it intends to
resist firmly.
   ``The (Rowntree) board have already stated and continue to
believe that the business of Rowntree can best be developed ... as
an independent group,'' Rowntree said in a statement.
   ``The offer from Nestle is unwelcome and does not reflect the
value of Rowntree's unique collection of international brands.''

<TEXT>
   Martin Marietta Corp. reported that its
profit jumped 15.4 percent in the first quarter from a year
earlier, boosted by improved results from all its businesses.
   The diversified aerospace and electronics company said Tuesday
that its first-quarter profit rose to $50.9 million, or 96 cents a
share, from $44.1 million, or 80 cents a share, in the first three
months of 1987.
   First-quarter sales increased to $1.3 billion from $1.1 billion
a year earlier. The company reported a record backlog of $11.1
billion in sales for the latest quarter.
   ``The improvement in first-quarter results supports our
expectation for further solid earnings progress in the balance of
the year,'' said Norman R. Augustine, the company's vice chairman
and chief executive.
   Martin Marietta delivered the first of its new Titan 4 rockets
to Cape Canaveral, Fla., in January for a planned launch in
October. The new launch vehicle can put 10,000 pounds of payload
into a stationary orbit 22,300 miles high.

<DATELINE>DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Baxter Travenol Laboratories Inc.
reported that its profit jumped 38 percent in the first quarter
from a year earlier, boosted by improved sales.
   The manufacturer of health care products and equipment said
Tuesday that its first-quarter profit rose to $91 million, or 31
cents a share, from $66 million, or 22 cents a share, in the first
three months of 1987.
   Sales expanded 12 percent, to more than $1.6 billion, including
$355 million in international sales. The dollar's weakness against
major foreign currencies contributed about $41 million to
international sales during the quarter, Baxter Travenol said. A
lower dollar makes U.S. products more competitive abroad.
   Sales of hospital products and services, the company's largest
business, contributed $880 million to revenue. All business sectors
showed improved revenue, but the industrial products division was
the best performer with sales rising 25 percent to $95 million, the
company said.
   ``Our first-quarter operating results point to another excellent
year for Baxter,'' said Vernon R. Loucks Jr., chairman and chief
executive officer. ``Our strong sales growth reflects a
continuation of an improving U.S. hospital market.''
   The company will seek shareholders' approval next month to
change its name to Baxter International Inc.

<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices rose sharply in late
trading Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, closing as much as
18 cents higher.
   The late surge on heavy trading volume followed comments made in
Washington by an Agriculture Department official that farmers
signing up for price support programs had agreed to take 3.5
million acres out of corn production instead of the 1.5 million
acres that the market had anticpated, said Victor Lespinasse, a
trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   The acreage could not be used for soybean production, which adds
new tension to a market already stressed by fears of tight supplies.
   ``That was the catalyst,'' Lespinasse said.
   He said speculation that Pakistan might be offered 50,000 tons
of U.S. soybean oil under a subsidized export program added further
fuel to the soybean rally.
   Corn and wheat futures advanced in sympathy with soybeans,
analysts said.
   At the close, wheat was } cent to 1} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.12 a bushel; corn was } cent to

<TEXT>
   California investor and television game
show magnate Burt Sugarman, whose sucesses include ``The Dating
Game,'' wants a match that will last with Media General Inc.
   But the family that controls the media empire through a special
class of stock hopes shareholders will give Sugarman's $1.6 billion
takeover bid the cutoff treatment accorded many contestants on
another Sugarman program _ ``The Gong Show.''
   The takeover fight under way in advance of Media General's May
20 shareholders meeting has been waged on three fronts _ in court,
in proxy materials and in newspaper advertisements.
   The battle is being monitored closely by major publishers
including the Washington Post Co., the New York Times Co., and Dow
Jones & Co., among other media companies that have dual classes of
stock intended to keep control in the hands of a few people. The
Graham family is seeking to tighten its grip on Washington Post
with a charter change to be voted on next month in reaction to the
bid for Media General.
   Sugarman, through two companies he heads, offered in February to
pay $61.50 a share for the nearly 90 percent of Media General stock
he does not control.
   But the family of Media General Chairman D. Tennant Bryan
declined the offer, expressing a desire to keep the Richmond-based
company independent.
   Sugarman controls just over 10 percent of the 28 million shares
of Media General's Class A common stock. But the Bryan family owns
71 percent of the more powerful 559,168 outstanding Class B shares,
which elect seven of the company's 10 directors.
   In lawsuits filed last month in U.S. District Court in Richmond,
Media General accused Sugarman of inciting speculation in the
company's stock. Management also wants the court to order Sugarman
to sell his shares.
   Sugarman, meanwhile, asked the court to allow Media General
shareholders to vote as a single class on his offer and maintained
only the three Class A directors should be allowed to consider the
buyout.
   Media General's management contends the buyout requires approval
of two-thirds of each class voting separately, but Sugarman says a
majority vote of the combined Class A and B shares is all that is
necessary for ratification.
   A hearing is set for Wednesday in the court dispute.
   After the suits were filed, Sugarman placed full-page ads in The
Wall Street Journal and two Media General daily newspapers, the
Richmond Times-Dispatch and The Richmond News Leader.
   The ads criticized the company's two-tier stock arrangement and
asked shareholders not to vote on management's proxy statement
until receiving Sugarman's proposals.
   Sugarman also is seeking to be elected to Media General's board
along with his allies, Dallas billionaire Harold C. Simmons and
David Gotterer, vice chairman of the two Sugarman companies that
control the Media General stock, Barris Industries Inc. of Beverly
Hills, Calif. and Giant Group Ltd. of Harleyville, S.C.
   Media General last week launched its own newspaper ad attack in
which it urged shareholders to back the company's slate of Class A
directors. The ads also advised shareholders against acting on
Sugarman's $61.50-per-share offer.
   In addition to Richmond Newspapers Inc., the parent of the
Times-Dispatch and News Leader, Media General also owns the
Winston-Salem Journal in North Carolina, the Tampa Tribune in
Florida, 32 weekly newspapers in southern California and a 40
percent interest in Garden State Newspapers Inc., which owns 18
dailies and four weeklies in eight states.
   Media General also owns television stations WCBD-TV in
Charleston, S.C., WJKS-TV in Jacksonville, Fla., and WXFL-TV in
Tampa, Fla.
   Sugarman's Barris Industries, which takes its name from founder
and TV personality Chuck Barris, is the maker of ``The Dating
Game,'' ``The Newlywed Game'' and ``The Gong Show.'' The Giant
Group is the parent firm of two cement companies.

<HEAD>Cartier To Acquire Controlling Interest In Piaget, Baume & Mercier</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cartier S.A. said Tuesday it will acquire a
controlling interest in Swiss watchmakers Piaget S.A. and Baume &
Mercier S.A., a move that will give the French luxury products
company a commanding share of the upscale watch market.
   Terms of the transaction were not disclosed, but Cartier
Chairman Alain Perrin said the acquisition should help boost
Cartier's sales to $840 million this year. Piaget and Baume &
Mercier had combined sales of $162 million last year.
   Perrin also said the acquisition will give Cartier control of
more than 40 percent of the $2.2 billion international luxury watch
market, and the combined company should pose a formidable challenge
to upscale watchmaker Rolex.
   The two companies will be held through Piaget Baume & Mercier
Holding, a parent company that will be 75 percent owned by Cartier
and 25 percent owned by Luxco, a Luxembourg-based holding company
that Cartier and its partners control.
   The holding company will hold 60 percent of both Piaget and
Baume & Mercier, and the Piaget family will retain the remaining
interest in each company.
   Both Piaget and Baume & Mercier, which are owned by the Piaget
family, will retain their management ``at least for the time
being,'' Perrin said.
   The move follows a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the
international luxury goods business, with further consolidation
likely in the watchmaking industry.
   Perrin disclosed Cartier hopes within the next year to gain a
controlling interest in Ebel S.A., another Swiss watchmaker.
   He also said discussions are underway with two other
privately-owned European luxury goods companies with a view to
expanding Cartier's market share in other product lines, but he
declined to give details.
   In addition to watches, Cartier is known for its jewelry,
cigarette lighters, luxury leather goods and perfumes.
   Cartier is 46.8 percent owned by Rothmans International PLC of
Britain. Sofina S.A., a unit of the Societe Generale de Belgique
group of Belgium, and the U.S. brokerage firm Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. hold up to 18 percent of Cartier. Perrin would not
identify other Cartier shareholders.
   Cartier's consolidated sales jumped by 36.8 percent last year to
$680 million from $497 million in 1986, while aggregate sales of
Piaget and Baume & Mercier were up 15 percent to $161.9 million.
   Cartier has never disclosed its earnings, but Perrin said the
company's sales could reach $840 million this year.
   Piaget, which initiated the takeover talks with Cartier, holds
the No. 1 position for luxury watch sales in the United States
despite a sales slump that hit the sector in 1986, Perrin said.

   The stock market posted some modest gains today,
although it gave back some of the morning's advance during
afternoon trading.
   The market gained strength through most of the morning, but
retreated in the early afternoon before advancing once again in the
final hour.
   Trading was relatively light.
   Before the market opened, the government reported that the the
economy grew at a 2.3 percent annual rate in the first three months
of 1988.
   That was down from growth of 4.8 percent in the October-December
quarter, but the growth estimate fell well within most forecasts.
   Analysts said the market has taken some encouragement from the
fact that the economy has not bogged down as some had feared after
last October's crash.
   But they noted that many individual investors remain leery about
getting back into the market because of the volatility that has
followed the crash.

<HEAD>UAW, Chrysler Talks Appear to be Back on Track</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Contract talks between Chrysler Corp. and the
United Auto Workers appeared back on track Tuesday after a week of
rank-and-file pressure that led to a UAW boycott of the talks a day
earlier.
   Meanwhile, Chrysler opened separate talks Tuesday with local
union leaders from Kenosha, Wis., over the closing of a
5,500-worker assembly plant and a pact covering 1,000 workers at a
remaining engine plant.
   UAW Local 72 President Ed Steagall and Chairman Rudy Kuzel,
along with national UAW representatives, were meeting with a
Chrysler team led by union relations manager James Carmichael, said
Chrysler spokesman Lloyd Northard.
   The talks were moved from Wisconsin to Detroit to make it easier
for the UAW and Chrysler to handle the negotiations. Stepp also is
bargaining with General Dynamics' Land Systems Division and several
battery companies.
   Chrysler announced early this year that it will close by year's
end a former American Motors Corp. assembly plant in Kenosha but
leave open a neighboring engine plant. The announcement angered
workers and Wisconsin officials who had assumed Chrysler would be a
strong provider of jobs.
   At the national contract negotiations, Chrysler and the UAW
continued talking Tuesday in an atmosphere that improved after a
protest Monday by UAW bargainers, who boycotted the talks for
several hours.
   Union bargainers had debated whether to break off the early
negotiations because of what they considered disruptive
announcements the previous week, including Chrysler Chairman Lee
Iacocca's $18 million 1987 earnings.
   Rank-and-file members also were angered by Chrysler's decision
to halt U.S. production of its Dodge Aries and Plymouth Reliant
K-cars at the end of the year and fill 1989 orders by increasing
production at a Mexican plant.
   On Thursday and Friday, local union leaders received detailed
reports of Chrysler's initial contract proposals, which veered
sharply from a job-protecting industry-pattern pact established
last fall at Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp.
   The contract, which covers 66,000 active and laid-off workers in
15 states and 65,000 retirees, expires Sept. 14. The two sides
agreed to early talks to prevent further deterioration in their
damaged relationship.
   Workers already angered by the Kenosha decision threatened to
cripple Chrysler with plant-by-plant strikes and general
non-cooperation when it attempted to sell its 28,000-worker Acustar
Inc. parts subsidiary.
   Chrysler backed off from the sale and asked for early talks in
March.

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed After GNP Data; Gold Also Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished mixed Tuesday after reacting
mildly to fresh economic data from the Commerce Department.
   Gold prices rose after falling in Europe and Asia. Republic
National Bank quoted bullion at $449 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT,
compared with $447.50 late Monday.
   Traders said the dollar weakened ``insignificantly'' after the
government reported that the gross national product rose at an
annual rate of 2.3 percent in the first quarter.
   The Commerce Department said consumer spending, the biggest
surge in business investment in more than four years and growing
exports kept the gross national product rising. Although the figure
was down from the 4.8 percent growth reported during the previous
quarter, it was in line with market expectations.
   ``There was minimal activity after the GNP report,'' said Curtis
Perkins, a trader at Chemical New York Capital Markets Group.
Activity picked up somewhat later in the session on technical
factors.
   Much of the day's activity centered on the buying of dollars
against the Japanese yen. But Ian Spence, chief dealer at
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., said he expects the dollar's rise
against the yen in domestic trading to be ``more than offset by
selling in Tokyo'' what currency markets open for trading.
   ``Exporters and other Japanese companies are happy with anything
at 125 yen (to the dollar) or higher,'' Spence said.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar fell 0.43 yen to a closing 124.57 yen. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 124.70 yen. In New York, the dollar finished at
125.15 yen, up from 124.735 yen.
   In Europe, the dollar ended slightly lower after trading in a
narrow range. A dealer in London noted that ``the GNP figure hasn't
given us a clear incentive to do anything new with the dollar.''
   But late in the session the dollar staged a partial recovery in
reaction to reports that Saudi Arabia might break diplomatic
relations with Iran.
   The British pound rose in London to $1.8760, from $1.8730 on
Monday. In New York it cost $1.8744 to buy one pound, more
expensive than Monday's $1.87355.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday,
included: 1.67235 West German marks, down from 1.67525; 1.38725
Swiss francs, down from 1.38735; 5.6945 French francs, up from
5.68625; 1,246.50 Italian lire, up from 1,244.75, and 1.2286
Canadian dollars, down from 1.23175.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday: 1.6747
West German marks, down from 1.6765; 1.3860 Swiss francs,
unchanged; 5.6875 French francs, down from 5.6915; 1.8765 Dutch
guilders, down from 1.8790; 1,244.00 Italian lire, down from
1,245.00, and 1.2289 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2309.
   Gold prices were mixed. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold
rose to close at $449.80 a troy ounce, from Monday's $448.90.
   In London gold fell to a late bid price of $447.50 a troy ounce,
from late Monday's $449.50. In Zurich, gold closed at a bid $448,
compared with $450 late Monday. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell
$1.19 to close at a bid $449.94.
   Silver bullion prices also varied. On New York's Comex, silver
rose to $6.381 a troy ounce, from Monday's $6.355. But in London
the metal was trading at a late bid price of $6.36 a troy ounce,
compared with Monday's $6.42.

<HEAD>P&G Quarterly Earnings Up 40 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Procter & Gamble Co. said Tuesday its fiscal
third quarter profit jumped 40 percent over a year ago, boosted by
a lower federal tax rate.
   The consumer products giant said it netted $263 million, or
$1.53 a share, for the three months ended March 31, compared with
earnings of $188 million, or $1.10 a share, last year.
   Worldwide sales also rose, to $4.8 billion from $4.2 billion.
   For the first nine months of the company's 1987-88 fiscal year,
net income totaled $880 million, or $5.14 a share, on sales of
$4.86 billion. That compared with earnings of $651 million, or
$3.82 a share, and $4.22 billion in sales.
   Procter & Gamble attributed its improved third quarter results
largely to a lower tax rate.
   Procter & Gamble produces a variety of consumer goods, including
laundry and cleaning products, personal card products,
pharmaceuticals, food and beverage products.
   The Cincinnati-based company had sales of $17 billion in its
last fiscal year.

<HEAD>Colon Free Zone: Crisis Delivers Sharp Setback</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLON FREE ZONE, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Colon Free Zone, normally one
of the world's busiest trading centers, is unusually quiet these
days.
   Huge container trucks stand unused in the zone's narrow streets,
empty cardboard boxes are piled on the sidewalks and workers sit
idle, waiting for something to do.
   Panama's political and economic crisis has dealt a severe blow
to the Colon Free Zone, considered the second largest in the world
after Hong Kong.
   Since the deepening of the nation's woes in late February, trade
has slowed dramatically, small firms have shut their doors, and
employees have been placed on unpaid leave.
   ``The situation couldn't be worse,'' said Francisco Anderson,
president of the Colon Free Zone Users Association, which
represents businesses here.
   Jaime V. Mizrachi, manager of Mizratex, said, ``We've never seen
a situation like this, ever.''
   And a truck driver, who refused to give his name for fear of
reprisals, said, ``There's nothing to do.''
   He's had little work in nearly two months, he said. There are
few buyers purchasing goods that need to be hauled outside the
zone. The total value of trade in the center was $205.4 million in
March, a 36.1 percent drop from March 1987, according to the zone's
administrative office.
   Broken down, the figures show that the value of goods imported
to the zone plunged 54.9 percent last month. Exports were off 17.4
percent.
   Anderson expects an even worse trade picture this month. He
projects a decline of 50 percent or more in the total value of
commerce.
   ``The current situation puts in imminent danger the existence of
the firms and the 8,000 permanent (jobs) of Panamanians who work in
(the zone),'' the users association said recently.
   The contraction comes after businesses rang up $4.33 billion in
trade in all of last year, the highest since the 94-acre center was
created in 1948.
   Before the crisis virtually paralyzed the nation's economy,
government officials had been projecting another banner year in
1988. Latin American countries, the zone's target group, have
shaken off some of their economic woes and been more flush with
cash in recent years.
   Located in the city of Colon at the Caribbean entrance to the
Panama Canal, the free zone acts as a channel for trade.
   Such consumer goods as televisions, jewelry, cosmetics,
clothing, liquor and pharmaceuticals flow into the zone from Japan,
the United States, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Britain, Switzerland and
elsewhere.
   Once in the zone, the products are stored, repackaged, taken
apart or put together and sent on to buyers mostly in Latin America.
   If bound for other countries, goods are free of duties,
assessments and fees. Profits are taxed at low rates.
   More than 700 companies have set up shop in the zone and
hundreds more are represented here.
   But with the nation's latest troubles, businessmen say some
small firms have already packed up and left. ``If you take a walk,
you can see a lot of places that say, `For Rent'' or `For Sale,'''
said Anderson. ``Two months ago, you couldn't get 50 meters of
space in here to rent out.''
   He is worried that, ``Those that go are not going to come back
and it's going to be very difficult to get new business.''
   The key problem for the zone was the government's March 3
closure of the nation's international banking center. The banks
suffered a cash squeeze aggravated by the freezing of official
Panamanian deposits in U.S. banks. The shortage prevented the
government from providing Panama's dozen locally owned and operated
banks with enough money to cover a run on deposits that began Feb.
26, when military strongman, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, ousted
the president, Eric Arturo Delvalle.
   Since then, the Reagan administration has imposed sweeping
sanctions on Panama in an effort to force the removal of Noriega,
who is under indictment in the United States on drug trafficking
charges.
   ``The closing of the banks has been the most damaging single
effect on the free zone,'' said Alfredo L. Maduro, general manager
of the firm Herbert Toledano.
   The trade center is highly dependent on credit. Money is lent to
firms in the zone to buy imports and to Latin American buyers who
then purchase those goods for re-export.
   ``Ninety-five percent of the business in the free zone
(involves) banking,'' said Anderson. ``We do it through banks. We
don't use cash at all.''
   The National Banking Commission, the government's bank
regulatory agency, has recently permitted the nation's
approximately 120 banks to resume limited operations.
   Late Monday, the commission announced the banks could resume,
with certain restrictions, handling letters of credit, an
instrument widely used in the free zone to guarantee payment.
   Businessmen doubted the step would have much impact on their
trade because of the restricted service and uncertainty about the
nation's future.

   The stock market posted some modest gains
Tuesday, bouncing back in the final hour of trading after the
morning's strong advance faded in the early afternoon.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 20 points
on Monday and nearly 17 points in the morning, finished with an
8.79-point gain to close at 2,044.76.
   It was the fourth consecutive gain in the market's best-known
indicator. Monday's close was revised to 2,035.97.
   Advancing issues outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 in the
overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 926
up, 551 down and 491 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 152.30 million shares compared
with 156.95 million shares on Monday.
   Before trading started, the government reported that the the
economy grew at a 2.3 percent annual rate in the first three months
of 1988.
   The first-quarter expansion in the gross national product, which
followed a 4.8 percent rise in the fourth quarter of 1987, had been
widely anticipated.
   Nonetheless, analysts said the market took some encouragement
from the fact that the economy had neither bogged down as some had
feared after last October's crash nor accelerated in a fashion that
might force the Federal Reserve to restrain it by encouraging
higher rates of interest.
   ``What Wall Street needs is moderation, not a boom or a bust but
an economy that is just chugging along,'' said Larry Wachtel, a
market analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``The GNP
numbers were just that _ chugging along.''
   Jack Solomon, a technical analyst for Bear Stearns & Co., said
the market welcomed the slower rate of growth because ``the feeling
is no one will be toying with money rates because the economy was
overheating.''
   Some recent reports of strong first-quarter earnings were also
cited as helping stock prices.
   But other analysts noted the relatively slow pace of trading,
and worried that gains recorded in such an environment could easily
be wiped out at the first suggestion of more negative economic
developments.
   Gene Jay Seagle, director of technical analysis for Gruntal &
Co. Inc., said the afternoon price pullback followed rumors that
non-OPEC members were close to an agreement with members of the
cartel on oil production cutbacks that would help keep prices up.
   Within an hour, the Dow Jones industrials retreated from being
up 16.25 points to being down about three points. The
widely-watched average recovered in the last hour of trading,
however.
   Texaco was the most actively-traded stock on the NYSE, and it
rose ] to 48~ after reporting sharply higher earnings.
   Elsewhere in the oil group, Chevron rose | to 49, Exxon rose \
to 45, Pennzoil was up ~ at 75{ and Amoco rose ~ to 79.
   Among other widely-held issues, American Telephone & Telegraph
fell { to 26}, General Electric fell \ to 40}, International
Business Machines rose ] to 114\ and General Motors rose 2 to 76|.
   Lucky Stores rose 1] to 55]. The company has been fighting a
takeover bid of $45 a share from American Stores and said it has
received other takeover proposals.
   But CNW fell 1 to 23[ after announcing it called off a leveraged
buyout.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $13.7 billion, or 0.53
percent, in value.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 177.78 million shares.
   The NYSE index rose 0.72 to 148.93.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 1.68 to 307.51, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.47 to 263.93.

<HEAD>Koppers Says Group Violated Order</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Koppers Co. on Tuesday charged an investment
group headed by British industrialist Brian Beazer violated court
orders by attempting to acquire shares in his $1.7 billion hostile
takeover bid.
   Two courts have barred BNS Inc., formed by Beazer, Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. and National Westminster Bank, from buying more
shares in its $60-per-share bid for the Pittsburgh-based cement
company.
   BNS said that as of last Friday, 13.9 million of Koppers' common
shares, or 53.4 percent, had been tendered.
   If BNS were able to consummate its offer, those shares, plus the
2.1 million BNS already holds, would give the group 56.9 percent of
Koppers' stock.
   Koppers on Tuesday asked the U.S. District Court in Pittsburgh
to order BNS to testify whether court orders involving stock
purchases have been violated.
   Koppers said BNS has taken a series of actions that ``are not
only contemptuous but a fraud on the market''
   Beazer spokeswoman Lissa Perlman said the company had no
immediate comment.
   Separately, a federal court in San Francisco also has prohibited
BNS from attempting to acquire a controlling interest in Koppers'
common stock on the grounds that the takeover might violate
antitrust laws.
   The order will stand at least until May 13, when the court is
scheduled to hear the BNS appeal.
   Koppers also asked the Pittsburgh court to order BNS to extend
its bid indefinitely. The offer, which has been extended weekly, is
set to expire at midnight Friday, unless extended again.
   Some analysts said the number of shares tendered, combined with
apparent lack of progress by Koppers' board in developing a
competing plan, could force Koppers to negotiate with BNS.
   Greg Drahuschak of Butcher & Singer Inc. in Pittsburgh, said
Koppers might have to reconsider its opposition to the bid if the
shares tendered reach 65 percent to 70 percent by the end of the
week.
   Without approval from Koppers' board, BNS would have to get 85
percent of Koppers' shares for its bid to be successful under
provisions of the anti-takeover law in Delaware, where Koppers is
incorporated.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Skyrocket On Set-Aside Acreage Talk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices soared in late trading Tuesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade, gaining as much as 18{ cents a bushel on
indications that fewer acres will be available for soybean
production. Grain futures also advanced.
   On other markets, energy and precious metals futures increased;
livestock and meat were mostly higher; and stock-index futures rose.
   The late soybean rally followed comments made in Washington by
an Agriculture Department official that the USDA expects about 9
million acres to be put into its optional program for wheat and
feed grains, analysts said.
   The price-support program pays farmers 92 percent of their
normal deficiency payments regardless of how little acreage they
plant.
   Ralph Klopfenstein, a deputy administrator in the Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service, said farmers signing up for
the program were expected to take 3.5 million acres out of corn
production instead of the 1.5 million acres the market had
anticpated, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   That acreage could not be used for soybean production, which
adds new tension to a market already stressed by fears of tight
supplies.
   ``That was the catalyst,'' Lespinasse said.
   Analyst Jerry Gidel of Chicago-based G.H. Miller & Co., said the
message was clear: ``USDA officials indicated there could be less
acreage of both corn and soybeans this spring,'' he said.
   Speculation that Pakistan might be offered 50,000 tons of U.S.
soybean oil under a subsidized export program added further fuel to
the soybean rally, Lespinasse said.
   Meanwhile the USDA announced that corn planting was under way
with about 15 percent of the crop planted through Sunday. That
compares with 11 percent on the same date last year and normal
progress of 9 percent for that date.
   Wheat settled } cent to 2 cents higher with the contract for
delivery in May at $3.12 a bushel; corn was } cent to 1} cents
higher with May at $2.00{ a bushel; oats were unchanged to { cent
higher with May at $1.65{ a bushel; soybeans were 16 cents to 18{
cents higher with May at $6.77{ a bushel.
   Gold futures ended a five-day decline, settling slighly higher
on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Silver also advanced.
   ``The gold market didn't seem to know quite what it wanted to do
today,'' said Sharon Ziemian of Citibank in New York. ``Right now
it's just kind of very quiet, trying to look for something to make
it move in one direction or the other.''
   Gold settled 90 cents to $1.10 higher with June at $451.30 a
troy ounce; silver was 1.8 cents to 2 cents higher with May at
$6.385 a troy ounce.
   Oil prices moved moderately higher on the New York Mercantile
Exchange as traders nervously watched the OPEC meetings that got
under way in Vienna, Austria.
   Officials of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
and rival producers met to discuss ways of reducing production to
boost prices.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 18 cents to 21 cents
higher with June at $18.60 a barrel; heating oil was .46 cent to
.83 cent higher with May at 52.04 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .26 cent to .41 cent higher with May at 52.42 cents a gallon.
   Most cattle futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
in reaction to higher cash prices and strong demand by beef
packers, analysts said.
   Live cattle settled .15 cent lower to .23 cent higher with June
at 70.40 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .57 cent
higher with April at 80.20 cents a pound; hogs were .50 cent lower
to .40 cent higher with June at 48.82 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .15 cent to .48 cent lower with May at 51.62 cents a
pound.
   Stock-index futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
where the contract for June delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500
index settled .95 point higher at 264.80.

<TEXT>
   America's burgeoning love affair with the
compact disk propelled the music business to a banner year in 1987,
with sales of records, cassette tapes and compact disks totaling
$5.57 billion.
   That figure _ based on suggested retail price, a somewhat
inflated estimate _ was up 20 percent from $4.65 billion in 1986,
the Recording Industry Association of America said Monday.
   The total number of disks sold also rose, in contrast to 1986
when sales of the high-priced disks pushed the dollar value up
while unit sales declined, the association said.
   The total number of records, tapes and disks shipped rose 14
percent to 706.8 million last year, but that failed to top the
all-time high unit sales of 726.2 million in 1978.
   Sales of compact disks, the high-quality, laser-read recordings
now favored by audiophiles, soared 93 percent in 1987, to 102
million disks worth an estimated $1.6 billion.
   The number of cassette tapes sold rose 19 percent to 410 million
tapes for an estimated $2.9 billion.
   Sales of record albums and extended play records dropped 15
percent to 107 million records, for an estimated $793 million.
Singles sales were down 13 percent to 82 million units, or $228
million.
   A new format, the cassette ``single,'' which contains just one
or two songs, accounted for 5 million units, or $14.3 million.

<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lucky Stores Inc., which three weeks ago
rejected a $1.74 billion takeover bid that would have created the
nation's largest supermarket chain, said Tuesday it has received
other takeover proposals.
   Lucky, California's second-biggest grocery chain, said it was
reviewing the new bids as well as other possibilities that would
benefit shareholders more than American Stores Co.'s pending tender
offer of $45 a share.
   A spokeswoman for Lucky declined to elaborate on the brief
formal statement.
   The company's soaring stock, which was trading at $32 a share a
month ago before American Stores announced its offer, closed up
another $1.37{ to $55.37{ Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
   In a separate development, American Stores _ which has extended
the deadline on its offer to Saturday _ suggested to the Securities
and Exchange Commission that Lucky hold an auction among interested
parties.
   Industry analysts said they had only vague ideas as to the
identity of Lucky's new suitors but said the company would be an
attractive acquisition.
   ``It's (one of) the largest in California with a very strong
identity of being the low-price leader and it has a meaningful
position in Florida. And it's a well-run company,'' said Ron Rotter
of Morgan, Olmstead, Kennedy & Gardner in Los Angeles.
   Lucky, based in Dublin, about 25 miles east of San Francisco,
employs 39,000 people and has 480 outlets. With 340 stores in
California, it is smaller only than Safeway among supermarket
chains based in the state.
   In March, Salt Lake City-based American Stores offered $1.74
billion to acquire Lucky's 38.6 million outstanding shares. The bid
came just 17 months after Lucky derailed a hostile takeover attempt
by New York investor Asher Edelman.
   American Stores, a grocery and drugstore chain, has 1,700
outlets in 40 states. A merger with Lucky would create the nation's
largest supermarket chain, surpassing Kroger Co.
   But Lucky turned the offer down and also rejected American
Stores' proposal to raise the bid to $50 a share, or $1.93 billion,
in a negotiated acquisition. In a statement, Lucky's board of
directors said its financial adviser, Goldman Sachs & Co.,
considered both offers inadequate.
   The Lucky board also authorized the company's management to
consider other ways to ncrease shareholder value, including a
possible reorganization of the company to focus on California, a
leveraged recapitalization with a possible special payment to
shareholders, and a negotiated sale of the company.
   Lucky Chairman John Lillie had asked interested parties to
submit bids by Monday.
   ``Just knowing management, I think they would just like to
remain independent,'' Rotter said.
   ``They are under the gun to enhance shareholders' value, maybe
through a leveraged buyout or having someone acquire them that is
not a supermarket retail company and who would let the existing
management team run the company,'' he said.

<HEAD>Poloroid Reports Drop In Quarterly Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polaroid Corp. said Tuesday that its
first quarter profit slipped nearly 50 percent from a year ago
despite a moderate rise in worldwide sales.
   The company blamed part of the poor performance on higher tax
rates and a sharp increase in expenditures linked to the planned
introduction of a new instant camera line next month.
   For the first three months of the year, net income totaled $12.8
million, or 21 cents a share, on sales of $410.1 million. That
compared with earnings of $24.6 million, or 40 cents a share, and
sales of $381.1 million in 1987.
   Polaroid said profits from operations fell to $26.2 million for
the period from $30.1 million during the first quarter last year.
   Polaroid spokesman Samuel Yanes said expenditures associated
with the introduction of the Impulse instant camera hurt earnings.
   Yanes said some of the first quarter costs involved marketing
geared toward clearing inventory of existing cameras and promotion
of the two Impluse cameras, scheduled to be introduced in stores
nationwide on May 9. Yanes said other expenditures included
research and development.
   The cameras, unveiled to the media in New York earlier this
month, are listed to sell at $89 and $69.
   The company also noted foreign currency exchange losses and a 30
percent increase in worldwide tax payments compared with the first
quarter of 1987 contributed to the profit and earnings decline.

<HEAD>GE Shareholders To Vote On Abortion Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA STOWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A General Electric Co. stockholder is
asking the company's shareholders to vote on ``refraining from
support of any organizations that counsel or perform abortion.''
   The company, whose annual meeting is Wednesday in Milwaukee,
says in its proxy statement that it recommends a vote against the
proposal.
   George Jamison, a spokesman for GE, said the company ``doesn't
knowingly support any organization that is pro- or anti-abortion.''
   The proposal is being offered in the name of Anthony Leschin of
Marshalltown, Iowa, but he referred questions to his wife, Shirley,
who said she had ``nothing to say other than what is worded in the
resolution.''
   The proposal said the ``the cumulative demographic facts of
abortion on demand ... have now begun to impact on the American
society.''
   It said abortion's consequences include ``the closing of schools
due to an absence of children, the ongoing expansion of nursing
care facilities of the elderly, and the future lack of younger
workers to sustain the Social Security system and the defense of
our nation.''
   In the proxy statement, GE said its ``board opposes this
proposal because the company does not adopt positions unrelated to
business interests ... the company has adopted no position on the
abortion issue.''
   When asked if the company offers charitable contributions to
groups on either side of the abortion issue, Jamison said, ``Not
that we know of.''
   Ned Raynolds, a senior vice president of the public relations
firm Hill and Knowlton Inc. in New York, said the anti-abortion
proposal reflects ``the basic phenomenon where people like to use
the proxy machinery to express an opinion on something.''
   ``This woman has an anti-abortion point of view, apparently,''
he said.
   Raynolds, who said he has supervised studies of company annual
reports, said ``there are all kinds of things'' showing up on proxy
statements ranging from experimental tests with animals to
protesting South Africa holdings.
   Shareholders of International Business Machines Corp., for
instance, defeated a resolution on Monday that would have
prohibited company benefit payments for abortions and related
services and required management to disclose to shareholders any
information about research and testing on animals.
   ``Nothing really surprises me in a proxy statement anymore,''
Raynolds said. ``This is a trend documented in lots of places where
institutions used to sell stock if they didn't like management, but
now they want to own stock and stay in, but get their point of
across.''

<HEAD>First RepublicBank Reports $1.5 Billion Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ailing First RepublicBank Corp., confirming an
earlier announcement, reported Tuesday a $1.5 billion loss for the
first quarter of 1988 and attributed much of it to heavy real
estate loan losses.
   The amount is the sixth-largest quarterly loss by a U.S.
corporation and is triple the amount of corporate projections.
   A preliminary announcement of the earnings loss on April 12
followed a $1 billion emergency loan extended by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. to the Dallas-based holding company on
March 19.
   In 1987, bank officials reported a loss of $656 million.
   Company officials said the first quarter loss primarily is the
result of a $1.4 billion loan loss in its real estate loan
portfolio and $126 million of losses and write-downs of assets.
   Earlier this month, Comptroller of the Currency Robert L. Clarke
urged First RepublicBank to begin restructuring and change its
leadership.
   Gerald W. Fronterhouse, former chairman and chief executive
officer, resigned April 12, when the huge loss was first indicated.
He was the second top executive to leave the firm during the
management shake-up arranged by federal regulators. Other top
officials followed Fronterhouse's departure.
   Fronterhouse was replaced by Albert V. Casey, 68, former
chairman of the board of AMR Corp., parent company of American
Airlines.
   ``The actions taken in the first quarter are consistent with our
intention that the company move ahead with its plan to restructure
and to recapitalize operations,'' Casey said in a statement Monday.
   First RepublicBank, the nation's 13th largest bank holding
company, included $235 million in its loan-loss provision for Third
World countries, increasing the provision to $612 million or 50
percent of the bank's $1.2 billion of outstanding debt to these
countries.
   The total loan loss provision exceeded what the company already
had written off in loan losses by $1.1 billion.
   The bank reported total non-performing assets increased from
$543 million in the fourth quarter of 1987 to $4.5 billion in the
first quarter of 1988 ending March 31.
   Eighty-five percent of the non-performing assets increase was
attributed to real estate-related assets, the bank said.

<HEAD>Oil Minister Says U.S. Criticism Unjustified</HEAD>

   An OPEC oil minister, reacting to U.S.
criticism of the cartel's talks with non-OPEC nations, said Tuesday
that closer ties among oil producers was in the interest of all
countries.
   ``OPEC is not against anybody,'' said Arturo Hernandez Grisanti,
the oil minister of Venezuela.
   ``OPEC is making efforts to stabilize the oil market, and this
stability is in the interests of everybody, including consumers,''
he said, adding that this was true ``even in the case of the United
States.''
   Hernandez made the unprompted remarks as he entered an evening
meeting of oil officials from six Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries and representatives of seven non-OPEC oil
exporters, including Mexico, China and Egypt.
   The two groups were exploring means of cooperation, including
possible joint cuts or restraints on oil production. Their aim is
to push prices up to OPEC's target of $18 a barrel.
   U.S. Energy Secretary John Herrington, speaking during a recent
tour of independent oil-producing nations, criticized OPEC for
seeking to collaborate with other countries. He said the Vienna
talks were ``doomed to failure.''
   ``I can't really understand why Secretary Herrington made such
aggressive attacks against OPEC,'' Hernandez said.
   The minister said OPEC's sole intention was to ``reach a
rational level in the price of oil.''
   ``I don't believe this is against the national interests of the
United States,'' he said. ``The United States is the country with
the highest cost of (oil) production.''
   He noted that proven oil reserves and production levels in the
United States have fallen sharply since world oil prices collapsed
two years ago.
   The United States was not invited to the Vienna meeting. Kent
Hance, A member of the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates
that state's oil industry, was here, however, to meet individually
with OPEC and non-OPEC oil officials.

   USX Corp. on Tuesday reported first quarter profit after
suffering a loss a year ago due to a lengthy strike, while
Bethlehem Steel Corp. said its earnings more than tripled and
Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. posted a profit after a loss a year
earlier.
   Pittsburgh-based USX posted first quarter net income of $157
million, or 52 cents per share, on sales of $4 billion. That
compared with a loss of $72 million, or 36 cents per share, and
$2.8 billion in sales in 1987.
   Financial results in the first quarter of 1987 were negatively
affected by the 184-day steel strike settled Jan. 31, 1987, and the
subsequent start-up costs, USX said.
   Wheeling-Pitt, which is reorganizing under federal bankruptcy
protection, posted a pfofit of $46.6 million, or $8.68 per share,
compared with a loss of $115.7 million in its first quarter of
1987. Sales rose to $263 million from $255 million in the
year-earlier period.
   The 1987 net loss stemmed largely from a change in the company's
accounting methods, Wheeling-Pitt said.
   Bethlehem Steel said it netted $85.4 million, or $1.13 a share,
compared with earnings of $25.6 million, or 38 cents a share, a
year ago. Sales jumped to $1.33 billion from $1.13 billion.
   The Bethlehem, Pa.-based company said steel shipments during the
first quarter totaled 2.7 million tons, up from 2.3 million tons
last year and the highest since the third quarter of 1981. The
company also noted that steel prices were up in the first quarter.
   Bethlehem Steel said its basic steel operations had a profit of
$98.1 million for the period, compared to $49.2 million a year ago.
It reported profits at its mills at Sparrows Point and Burns
Harbor, Md., and at Bethlehem.
   USX said its steel unit, the nation's largest steelmaker, earned
$167 million on sales of $1.4 billion, compared with an operating
loss of $180 million on sales of $190 million in the same quarter
of 1987.
   ``The impressive results in steel are due to reduced costs,
strong demand and modestly higher prices,'' said USX Chairman David
M. Roderick. ``We're finally putting to rest the image of a
rust-belt industry and replacing it with an image of a highly
productive, lean and profitable worldwide competitor.''
   Roderick said the company expects further profit improvement in
the second quarter and a continued strong financial performance for
the remainder of the year.
   ``We see no letup in demand nor softening of prices for steel
products,'' he said. ``We are, likewise, optimistic that results in
our energy segment will improve as crude oil prices stabilize and
refining and marketing margins improve.''
   The company said its energy segment netted $91 million on sales
of $2.4 billion in the first quarter. This compares with operating
income of $121 million on sales of $2.3 billion in the first
quarter of 1987.
   Marathon Oil reported first quarter earnings of $84 million on
sales of $2.1 billion, compared with $115 million on sales of $2.1
billion a year ago. Texas Oil & Gas Corp. reported income of $7
million on sales of $276 million in the first quarter, compared
with $6 million on sales of $249 million in the first quarter a
year ago, the company said.
   The diversified businesses segment reported income of $97
million on sales of $322 million in the first quarter, compared
with $8 million on sales of $324 million a year ago. The current
quarter's results included a favorable $43 million partial
adjustment of the restructuring provision taken in 1986, USX said.
   Wheeling-Pitt said an 8 percent increase in product prices
resulted in a 3 percent increase in net sales for the 1988 quarter,
up to $262.9 million on shipments of 548,094 tons of steel products.
   The company reported that operating costs and raw steel
production both dropped 1 percent.

<HEAD>CNW Buyout Called Off</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CNW Corp. and a New York investment firm have
canceled a planned $578 million leveraged buyout of the
Chicago-based transportation and manufacturing company because of
legal questions, the company announced Tuesday.
   The investment banking firm Gibbons, Green, van Amerongen and a
CNW senior management group had offered $31 a share to acquire the
company, in a deal that CNW spokesman James Foote said hinged
partly on CNW's plan to sell some of its local and regional routes
in Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula.
   A number of railroad companies, including CNW, are involved in
lawsuits with union workers who contend railroads have an
obligation to bargain with their employees over the sale of local
and regional routes, Foote said.
   In February, in light of the unresolved legal issues, CNW and
Gibbons, Green extended the closing date for the deal one month to
May 31.
   ``Because of continuing uncertainties concerning labor aspects
of regional line sales, the merger could not be consummated prior
to the May 31 deadline,'' James R. Wolfe, CNW's chairman and chief
executive, stated Tuesday.
   ``The board concluded that an extension of that deadline was not
in the best interests of CNW shareholders,'' Wolfe said.
   The leveraged buyout deal, approved by CNW's board on Nov. 16,
consisted of a package of cash and securities valued at $31 a share.
   CNW fell $1 to $23.12{ in trading Tuesday on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   The deal called for Gibbons, Green to own 57.5 percent of the
succeeding company's common stock. The senior CNW investment group
led by Wolfe was to hold a 7.2 percent stake, with 35.3 percent
held publicly.
   CNW owns the Chicago and North Western Transportation Co., a
leading freight hauler in the Midwest and Great Plains states.
