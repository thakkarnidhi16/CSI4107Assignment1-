   U.S. District Judge Edward T. Gignoux, who
served 26 years on the federal bench, died Friday after an illness.
He was 72.
   Gignoux, who had been in failing health for months, died at 6:30
p.m. at Maine Medical Center, the hospital said. The cause of death
was not disclosed, but a friend said Gignoux had suffered from
throat cancer.
   Born in Cape Elizabeth in 1916, Gignoux graduated from Harvard in
1937 and from its law school in 1940. He later joined a Portland law
firm and served on the City Council from 1949 to 1955.
   Gignoux, who lived with his wife Hildegarde in Falmouth, was
appointed to the U.S. District Court bench in 1957 and for 20 years
was Maine's only federal judge. He retired in 1983 but continued to
hear cases as a senior judge.
   Gignoux in 1973 presided over the contempt trial of Abby Hoffman,
Bobby Seale and the other radicals known as the Chicago Seven. He
also presided at the briber-conspiracy trial of U.S. District Judge
Alcee Hastings in Miami.
   Gignoux was honored Sept. 19 when the federal courthouse was
renamed the Edward Thaxter Gignoux United States Courthouse.

<HEAD>S&L System Not Set up to Handle Losses This Big</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Congress never intended for the savings and loan
industry to pay for the extraordinary losses now being generated by
insolvent S&Ls, the industry's top federal regulator says.
   M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,
urged Congress to delve into the history of the deposit insurance
system before deciding whether or not to spend taxpayer dollars to
rescue the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which
guarantees S&L deposits up to $100,000.
   Wall told the U.S. League of Savings Institutions on Thursday
that Congress, in setting up the deposit insurance system, set the
premiums charged to financial institutions high enough to cover only
normal losses, not catastrophic losses.
   An actuarial study at the time showed that, to cover all future
losses, premiums would have had to have been set nearly four times
higher than they were originally, Wall said.
   Some of Wall's listeners concluded he was implying that Congress
should help the industry pay the bill, but Wall said, ``I'm not
taking that step.''
   ``I'm not saying what the solution is at this point, I'm just
trying to set a historical basis,'' he said, promising to present
the bank board's recommendations after the election.
   Regulators estimate it will cost $45 billion to $50 billion to
cover the industry's red ink.
   The new chairman of the league, B.R. Beeksma, said healthy S&Ls
can't bear the cost of bailing out their insurance fund without
falling into insolvency themselves.
   Deregulation promoted by the Reagan administration and sought by
the industry allowed many S&Ls in the early 1980s to raise interest
rates offered to depositors and venture into new kinds of loan
arrangements. But many underwrote highly speculative and ultimately
disastrous loans, often in real estate, and as of midyear 497 of the
nation's 3,048 S&Ls were listed as insolvent. Another 408 were
solvent but losing money.
   Now, the industry that fought so hard for deregulation in the
early 1980s says government should have regulated it more, and it is
calling for a return to many of the controls of the past.
   Beeksma, as part of what he called the industry's ``never-again
agenda,'' said S&Ls will accept a clampdown on the kinds of lax
regulation that contributed to the red ink.
   ``I can promise you that the U.S. League will be vigorous in its
pursuit of tighter regulation and supervision,'' he said.
   Beeksma, chairman of InterWest Savings Bank in Oak Harbor, Wash.,
replaces Theo H. Pitt Jr., a North Carolina thrift executive who
served as league chairman for the past year.
   The trade group also appointed Frederick L. Webber as its new
president, the top staff position. Webber is a former assistant
secretary of the Treasury in the Ford administration and former
White House aide under Richard Nixon. He most recently was president
of the National Soft Drink Association.
   He replaces William B. O'Connell, who has held the post since
1979.
   O'Connell, in his outgoing address, warned the S&L executives
against a ``division that seems to be developing over the resolution
of the problems'' of the FSLIC.
   O'Connell said after the speech he was referring to tension
between healthy and struggling S&Ls. Some healthier S&Ls are trying
to leave the FSLIC and join the commercial bank insurance fund, the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which charges lower premiums.
Ailing institutions that can't qualify for FDIC membership resent
that.

   The Associated Press reported incorrectly on Nov.
2 that the family of John F. Kennedy had cooperated in creation of a
series called ``John Fitzgerald Kennedy: A Celebration of His Life
and Times,'' being broadcast on the Disney Channel this month.
   The Disney Channel acknowledged Thursday that the material used
in the series came from the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum in
Boston, rather than directly from the family of the late president
as it reported in an earlier news release.

<HEAD>Study Says Poverty Rate For Hispanics Up Sharply</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poverty among Hispanics has risen at a faster
rate than for other ethnic groups over the past nine years,
according to a study by a non-partisan research group.
   ``The current economic recovery appears to be benefiting
Hispanics much less than other groups. Hispanics are the only racial
or ethnic group whose poverty rate remains at or close to recession
levels (of the early 1980s),'' said Robert Greenstein, director of
the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
   The group's study found the percentage of Hispanics living in
poverty grew from 21.6 percent in 1978 to 28.2 percent in 1987,
while the poverty rate for whites grew from 8.7 percent to 10.5
percent, and from 30.6 percent to 33.1 percent for blacks. The
poverty rate for all Americans increased from 11.4 percent in 1978
to 13.5 percent last year.
   The center _ a non-partisan, non-profit research organization
that studies government spending, programs and public policy issues
affecting low and moderate-income Americans _ based its findings on
data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Labor Department. It used 1978
as a comparison year with 1987 because national economic conditions,
such as national and Hispanic unemployment rates, were nearly the
same in both years.
   During the nine-year period, the income of the typical Hispanic
family fell nearly $1,600, after adjustment for inflation, compared
with an increase of $276 for a white family and a decline of $854
for a black family, the study said.
   As a result of declines in Hispanic earnings, the study said the
median income for Hispanics equalled 62.9 percent of median family
income for whites last year, the lowest percentage on record.
   Hurt hardest by the increase in poverty and the earnings decline
have been Hispanic married families, the study said. Their poverty
rate grew by more than half, with fewer than one in eight families
below the poverty level in 1978 compared with nearly one in five in
poverty last year.
   The study also found that two in five Hispanic children were
living in poverty last year, or 39.6 percent, up from a rate of 27.2
percent in 1978.
   Raul Yzaguirre, president of the National Council of La Raza, a
Hispanic organization, said the study is further evidence Hispanics
are the poorest community of people on a per capita basis, yet
Latinos have the highest labor participation rate.
   He blamed the failure of the educational system to keep students
in school and an increase in job discrimination for the rise in the
poverty rate.
   Greenstein blamed the increase in the poverty rate and the
decline in earnings on several factors, including the sharp erosion
in the value of the minimum wage, which at $3.35 per hour has remain
unchanged since January 1981, while consumer prices have risen 38
percent over that period.
   ``Because Hispanic workers are more likely to be paid low wages
than non-Hispanics, the lack of a minimum wage increase in nearly
eight years has affected Hispanics with greater severity than it has
affected the general population,'' the study said.
   Cutbacks in state and federal budget programs also have
contributed to the increase in poor Hispanics, the study said. Only
one in 14 poor Hispanic families with children was raised from
poverty with government assistance in 1987, compared with one in
eight in 1979.

   Bobbing in the big, old-fashioned
tub, toes hooked over a water spout to keep from capsizing as tiny
bubbles effervesce up the length of a sore spine, it's hard to worry
whether this is just what the doctor ordered.
   ``If you don't have anything wrong with you, if you lead a
strenuous life, it's just for relaxation,'' says bathhouse attendant
Gertrude Zorn.
   Otherwise, says Zorn, who for 15 years has been drawing the water
for the tub then coming back to wrap the client in a hot sheet when
it's time to get out, the bubbly float on naturally carbonated water
is good for arthritis, rheumatism and bad backs.
   The bathhouses with their white tile walls, ceiling-fans and
small individual suites with the giant tubs, look as though they
haven't changed from the 1930s when the state decided the area's
carbonated waters were a natural resource.
   Nothing trendy here, especially the price: $8.75 for the soak,
room and attention.
   But elsewhere, spas are an old-fashioned idea gone Yuppie _ and a
multimillion-dollar business. For many now, spa means the chrome and
glass spot where you ride exercise machines in a fuchsia leotard. It
can mean being floated in a seawater tub or swathed in an herbal
wrap.
   Jeffrey Joseph, a New York entrepreneur who jumped in just as the
water was heating up, says his travel agency has tripled in both
staff and bookings since he began specializing in spa vacations a
year and a half ago.
   Joseph, owner of Spa-Finders Travel Arrangements Ltd., estimates
that in five years, the number of spas in this country has increased
from 30 to 150 and is still growing.
   About 1.2 million Americans spend $700 million to $800 million
annually going to spas, Joseph estimates. The majority of his
clients, who spend about $1,000 for a week's retreat, are low-level
female executives in their 30s.
   But is the new emphasis on physical conditioning simply a fad, or
is it really good for your health?
   Are you ready for this? A $1,000-$3,500 week at a spa can be as
healthful as sitting at home in your rocker or taking a hot shower,
say both a cardiologist and a sports psychologist.
   ``Does it feel good to go sit in a whirlpool or a hot mineral
bath? Of course, it feels good,'' says psychologist Eric Margenau of
New York City.
   ``Does it serve a medicinal purpose? I haven't seen any evidence
of that.''
   What about stress management? That's the new ``buzz word,'' says
Joseph.
   The experts say any form of relaxation and exercise will do if
you plan for it and do it regularly. If you go off once a year,
expecting an expensive vacation to be your lifeline for the next 12
months, you're in trouble.
   ``I like spas, they're great. But I've been to great dude ranches
that I've come back from just as refreshed,'' says Margenau, the
author of a new book called ``Sports Without Pressure.''
   Dr. James M. Rippe, the cardiologist who heads the Exercise
Physiology Laboratory at the University of Massachusetts Medical
School in Worcester, echoes that. He says people mustn't delude
themselves that ``they can go twice a year and make up for the
excesses of the rest of the year.''
   Joseph, whose agency has sent nearly 4,000 clients to spas around
the world since March 1987, says the better resorts work on behavior
modification. In other words, they don't just put you in an aerobics
class or stick you on a diet, ``they have a whole program on stress
management and healthy living _ things to take home with you.''
   Spas as places to take mineral waters go back at least as far as
the Romans.
   In Europe and Japan, people have been spa-minded for centuries.
One town in Japan _ Beppu, known for boiling ponds that shoot mud
into the air _ gets 12 million visitors each year, Joseph said.
   In this country, traditional spas with a chic clientele were
booming before the turn of the century _ places like Mineral Wells,
Texas; Hot Springs, Ark.; White Sulphur Springs, W.Va.; and
Calistoga, Calif., which stands for California's Saratoga.
   This New York town, the granddaddy of American spas whose
medicinal springs were discovered in the late 18th century, was long
a social hot spot with its added cache of a thoroughbred racing
season.
   Nowadays, Morgenau sees the proliferation of spas as part of a
burgeoning ``stress industry.''
   ``The whole business is blown up way out of proportion. There is
a whole economy built up around stress reduction, the new American
fads _ spas, contraptions, a $1,000 worth of vitamins.''
   Instead of those remedies, he recommends altering day-to-day
patterns to defuse pressure. Slow down, he says, take a longer
lunch, schedule exercise.
   ``Yes, stress exists. It always has. But most of the stresses are
very easily remedied.''
   ``Every man's spa is his shower,'' says Rippe, the author of many
medical and fitness books.
   The medical school professor cites his own studies and those of
colleagues that indicate showers and sitting in a recliner can
reduce tension and anxiety, and that blood pressure, as well, is
reduced by regular programs of walking.
   Barbara Sloan, a confirmed spa-goer, isn't interested in hearing
she could have stayed home and taken a shower.
   ``It was wonderful,'' she said of a posh Florida spa. ``A massage
was part of every day. The food, absolutely out of this world.''
   Joseph's catalog says a week at the resort Mrs. Sloan visited
also included greens fees, herbal wrap, salt-glo loofa scrub,
hairdo, makeup, manicure, pedicure and lectures _ all for $1,970.
   ``A spa,'' said Mrs. Sloan, president of a New Jersey public
relations firm, ``means attention and luxury.
   ``Plush towels, beautiful locker rooms, pampering. If you have to
wait for an massage appointment, they give you a cup of bouillon,''
she said.
   ``I can't imagine it was not good for you.''

<HEAD>International Wheat Variety Wins Belgian Prize</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A research firm headed by an American is being
awarded a Belgian prize for a new variety of wheat developed under
the leadership of an Indian scientist by crossing a Russian winter
wheat with a Mexican spring variety.
   The prize goes to the International Maize and Wheat Improvement
Center outside Mexico City, known from its initials in Spanish as
CIMMYT.
   ``Eight million people all over the world can get the grain they
need from the additional production'' yielded by the new variety,
said Donald Winkelmann, the American who heads the center.
   He explained that ``veery'' wheat varieties produce as much as 10
percent more grain than the wheats of the ``green revolution'' of
the 1970s. The extra 10 percent amounts to enough wheat to satisfy
the needs of 8 million people.
   The miracle wheats of the 1970s were developed by Norman Borlaug,
an American who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for his work at
CIMMYT. Now 74, he is still active there. Winkelmann said the veery
varieties were produced in accordance with his principles.
   They were also named after a system he established of using the
names of birds for new varieties, in much the same way as weathermen
use the first names of men and women for typhoons and hurricanes.
The veery is a small brown thrush, well-known to bird-lovers in the
Americas.
   ``If we'd known the results we were going to get, we's have named
it something grander, maybe peacock wheat,'' Winkelmann said.
   CIMMYT is one of 13 international agricultural research groups
around the world. They are coordinated by the World Bank and are
holding an annual meeting here this week under the bank's auspices.
The award was being formally presented at today's final session.
   Winkelmann spoke at the Belgian embassy on Thursday where
Ambassador Herman Dehennin announced the King Baudouin award, which
is given to one of the 13 research groups every two years.
   Work on veery wheat started in 1973. It was developed by members
of a team at CIMMYT headed by Sanjaya Rajaram, an Indian.
Researchers crossed a winter wheat called kavkaz, after the Caucasus
mountains in Russia, with a Mexican spring wheat known as buho.
Winter wheats are robust and resist disease. Spring wheats give
bigger yields.
   The cross developed into what Winkelmann called a ``wheat for all
seasons.''
   It was tested in 50 countries. Winkelmann said it is becoming the
dominant wheat in Mexico, where it was first introduced in 1981. The
first plantings in Pakistan came the following year.
   Winkelmann said it is now cultivated on at least 10 million acres
worldwide.

<TEXT>
   Venezuelans, whose fortunes rise and
fall with the price of oil, are heading into a presidential election
next month at a time when their once-robust economy is in a serious
slump.
   The seventh-month campaign for the Dec. 4 balloting has been rich
in promises by candidates who have yet to explain how they would pay
for their programs if elected.
   More than 9 million people, roughly half the population of the
country, are eligible to vote to elect their seventh president since
the nation's last dictator, Gen. Marcos Perez Jimenez, was
overthrown in 1958.
   The main candidates are former President Carlos Andres Perez, 66,
of the social democratic Accion Democratica (AD) party and Eduardo
Fernandez, 48, of the Social Christian Party, better known as COPEI,
the acronym formed by its name in Spanish.
   Recent polls give a lead of 14 points to Perez, who served as
president in 1973-78, when Venezuela was awash in oil dollars.
   Both candidates have made campaign promises ranging from
modernizing the nation's industries and placing computers in every
school to new hospital beds and free milk for school children.
   Neither has detailed where they will get money to pay for it all.
   But with the nation's once-overflowing treasury now nearly empty,
whoever wins is likely to find it difficult to fulfill campaign
pledges.
   Despite a relative success in agriculture, Venezuela's economy
has been hard-hit by persistently low prices of oil, the nation's
major source of export revenue. Oil has plunged from a high of $30 a
barrel in the 1970s to its current level of around $13.
   Current prices on world markets continue to slump, a sharp
contrast to the market boom during Perez' first term, when he
nationalized the oil industry. The slide in oil prices this year
alone may cost the nation as much as $3 billion in revenue, nearly a
third of the $10.7 billion originally expected.
   Coupled with a foreign debt of $35 billion, Latin America's
fourth largest after Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, a continuation of
this trend may pose a heavy political and social burden to the
government to be installed in February.
   According to official statistics, real income for the average
Venezuelan family has shrunk by 20 percent since 1982, when oil
prices began to fall.
   While less than 1.5 percent of the population enjoys 35 percent
of the nation's income, 40 percent do not earn enough to cover their
basic nutritional needs, according to a Venezuelan Central
University report.
   Perez and Fernandez agree that drastic changes must be
implemented to reverse this trend. But while Perez proposes to
expand public sector expenditures as a means to boost the economy,
Fernandez says he would rely more on the private sector.
   Rather than emphasizing their differences, both Perez and
Fenandez have devoted most of their efforts trying to discredit each
other.
   Intense hostility kicked off the early part of the campaign when
both candidates accused each other of receiving campaign money from
drug traffickers.
   The exchange of accusations ceased only when the Supreme
Electoral Council, which supervises the campaign, called on Perez
and Fernandez to avoid injurious attacks.
   AD and COPEI have traditionally alternated in power, with AD
winning over COPEI four out of six times in the 30 years of civilian
rule.
   Both parties together totalled 90 percent of the vote in the 1983
elections, won by the AD's Jaime Lusinchi, now the incumbent
president.
   Twenty-one other candidates also are in the running, covering a
wide range of the political and social spectrum.
   One is a witch doctor, Romulo Abreu Duarte, who professes a
fervent belief in the legendary goddess Maria Lionza, descended, her
devotees say, from a Spanish conquistador and an Indian princess.
   Others include the former pro-Castro guerrilla leader Teodoro
Petkoff of the leftist Movement toward Socialism, and Ismenia
Villalba of the centrist Democratic Revolutionary Union.
   Aware of the overwhelming strength of AD and Copei, the minor
parties are aiming instead to win some of the 229 congressional
seats at stake.
   Both Villalba, the first woman to ever run for president in
Venezuela, and Petkoff expect to improve their parties'
congressional strength, now respectively 11 and 9 seats.
   The tiny Venezuelan Communist Party is running in a coalition led
by Edmundo Chirinos, former rector of Venezuelan Central University.
   AD and COPEI stand to lose considerable legislative power if the
minor parties make gains in the congressional balloting, analysts
say.

   Secular Israelis who are a majority in the
Jewish state fear the strong election showing of ultra-Orthodox will
rekindle the ``Sabbath Wars,'' weekly battles outside movie theaters
and restaurants.
   Tensions subsided in December, after the outbreak of the
Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories, but have
re-emerged following this week's parliamentary elections.
   Four religious parties won a pivotal 18 seats in the 120-seat
Knesset and control the balance of power between the right-wing
Likud bloc and left-leaning Labor Party. They are in a position to
wring major concessions in exchange for their support.
   Non-observant Israelis fear that as a result, they could be
banned from driving to the beaches on the weekend and deprived of
pork in restaurants and Saturday afternoon soccer matches.
   ``These ultra-Orthodox are dogmatic. There will be no compromise.
How will we live together?'' asked Yoram Kaniuk, a well-known writer
interviewed on Israel television.
   He said modern Zionism, the movement that brought Jews to
resettle the land of Israel, was motivated by a rejection of the
image of religious Jews living in the ghettos of eastern Europe.
   ``Zionism was a revolution against the ghetto, a rebellion
against this blind faith that God will take care of everything,'' he
said.
   The religiously observant make up only 20 percent to 25 percent
of Israel's 3.5 million Jews.
   Some secular politicians have said an Israel governed by
fundamentalist rabbis would be as joyless as Ayatollah Khomeini's
Islamic revolution in Iran.
   Some of the alarm seems exaggerated because Orthodox parties have
held the balance of power in Israeli governments since 1981 without
forcing major changes in the lives of the non-religious.
   However, they have had some legislative triumphs such as a law
banning the national airline El Al from flying on the Sabbath.
   Experts say the current fight is likely to center in the holy
city of Jerusalem, where more than half the 340,000 Jews are
Orthodox and many more are observant.
   ``Jerusalem will be the battleground,'' predicted Daniel Elazar
of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs.
   He predicted the 1987 ``Sabbath Wars'' that became a weekend
ritual outside movie theaters, pubs and restaurants will rsume in
Jerusalem.
   In the Ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of Mea Shearim, slogans
scrawled on walls denounce police and Mayor Teddy Kollek for
refusing to close entertainment spots on the Sabbath.
   Elazar said the religious would probably not try to enforce such
bans in predominantly secular cities such as Tel Aviv.
   ``They will concentrate on Jerusalem and leave other areas until
later. They feel they will be a majority in 40 years, and do not
want to alienate too much the people they seek to convert,'' said
Elazar.
   He and other analysts said the Orthodox would likely mount a
major campaign for Jerusalem's municipal elections in February in
hopes of increasing their say in the city council, where religious
parties hold 10 of 31 seats.
   The ultra-Orthodox are the fastest growing population group in
Israel. Elazar said non-religious Israelis had an average 2.6
children per couple, modern Orthodox about four and ultra-Orthodox
more than eight.
   ``We shall grow in number because only we immigrate to Israel and
because we don't have abortions and family planning,'' said Rabbi
Menachem Porush, a lawmakers from the ultra-Orthodox Agudat Israel
party, which won five seats in parliament.
   Already Orthodox power is greater than its numbers. In addition
to holding pivotal parliament seats, rabbis can rule on personal
matters such as legality of marriages and divorces.
   The also have the support of a large but indeterminate number of
non-observant Jews who respect tradition.
   Ultra-Orthodox leaders have pledged not to try to coerce secular
Israelis. But they clearly are prepared to do battle over observing
the biblically mandated day of rest.
   ``The land of Israel will maintain its Jewish image, its Jewish
values,'' said Porush. ``In a Jewish country, the Sabbath is a
Jewish value.''

<HEAD>NASA Faces Shortages That Could Ground Shuttle In 1990</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   For the second time this year, the space agency
is facing a supply shortage that could ground space shuttles in
1990, and it is looking nervously for other potential gaps in
critical materials.
   The country's only manufacturer of rayon yarn used in shuttle
booster rocket nozzles, Avtex Fibers, began closing its plant in
Virginia on Thursday _ only two days after announcing its plans to
do so.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration faced a similar
problem in May when the Henderson, Nev., plant of Pacific
Engineering and Production Co. was destroyed in an explosion and
fire. Pepcon, as the firm is called, was one of only two producers
of ammonium perchlorate, the oxidizer in the solid fuel that powers
the shuttle's booster rockets.
   At this point, NASA is guaranteed enough booster rocket fuel to
power nine flights and has enough rayon for ten. That would take the
agency through this year when only one more flight is scheduled and
through next with seven on the calendar.
   No one at NASA headquarters or at the agency's Marshall Space
Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., would say how many other
materials used for shuttle flights have only a single supplier.
   However, sources who declined to be identified said shuttle
program boss Richard Truly would probably order a thorough study to
identify them and the potential for a cutoff of supply.
   Shuttle builder Rockwell International Corp. alone depends on
more than 250 subcontractors nationwide for various systems and
components. Some are single-source.
   For example, one metal _ NARloy-Z _ is a specially developed
alloy used by the firm's Rocketdyne division in the engine's
combustion chamber and it is made by only a single licensee.
Similarly, only one foundry makes the engine turbine blades and
there is only one set of tooling for those.
   The presidential commission that investigated the Challenger
disaster criticized the space agency for not having enough spares on
hand, which fostered a practice of borrowing parts from one shuttle
for use on another.
   That problem has not been completely solved. After the flight of
Discovery last month, engineers found evidence of a leak in one
engine. They had to borrow an engine from shuttle Columbia to
prepare Discovery for its next mission.
   Rocketdyne's Joyce Lincoln said there are 16 engines in
existence: three each on Discovery and Atlantis, two new units
undergoing acceptance testing, one being assembled after overhaul
and seven undergoing improvements. That situation is not likely to
ease until spring.
   The impact of the fuel and nozzle problems won't be felt for more
than a year. An allocation board that included the Defense
Department, NASA and other government agencies met recently to
divide up ammonium perchlorate production.
   ``We have been allocated sufficient quantities for nine flight
sets,'' said Rocky Raab, spokesman for Morton Thiokol in Utah which
builds the rocket boosters that flank the orbiter.
   ``The allocation board meets again in early 1989 to make
additional allocations, so presuming Pepcon gets the plant going
again in early or mid-1989 that would mitigate that situation,'' he
said.
   Only the late-November flight of Atlantis remains this year and
there are seven more missions scheduled for 1989.
   Pepcon is rebuilding its plant in Henderson and has broken ground
for a new facility for finishing work in Cedar City, Utah.
``Presuming everything goes as planned, our concerns about the fuel
are minimized,'' Raab said.
   It is too soon to know what will be done about Avtex which began
closing its plant at Front Royal, Va., on Thursday and letting its
1,300 employees go. ``Production, for all intents and purposes, is
stopping today,'' said Avtex spokesman Nick Nichols. ``People will
be working for the next couple of days to shut it down and secure
it.''
   Morton Thiokol, NASA, the Pentagon and other contractors were
talking with Avtex in hopes of finding a solution to the shutdown.
Raab said Thiokol had enough material for 10 flight sets.
   ``It's a possibility that rayon might be available elsewhere, but
it has to be a qualified source,'' he said. Rayon is the root stock
for what ends up as carbon phenolic, a fireproof material that lines
the inside of the booster nozzle. The same cloth is used to make
nozzles for MX missiles, small intercontinental missiles and the
Trident II system.
   ``You can't force somebody to manufacture some product,'' Raab
said.

   Toxic PCB compounds someday could be gobbled up
by bacteria during hazardous waste cleanup operations, according to
new findings from the bottom of the Hudson River.
   PCBs accumulated in sediment above Troy, N.Y. are being changed
into less toxic forms by bacteria that work without oxygen,
researchers from Michigan State University report. These less toxic
forms do not accumulate in living tissue.
   PCBs' tendency to accumulate in tissue has led several states to
advise against eating PCB-contaminated fish. New York, for example,
has banned fishing for striped bass below Troy all the way to the
ocean.
   The new findings raise hopes that highly toxic PCBs could be
changed into the less toxic, non-accumulating forms in more
locations.
   ``If it is true, it could have enormous significance,'' said
Richard D. Morgenstern, head of the Office of Policy Analysis in the
Environmental Protection Agency.
   It's too early to start looking for PCB-free striped bass, said
Darrell Banks, deputy commissioner of the state's Department of
Environmental Conservation, which plans to dredge and remove 360,000
cubic yards of PCB-contaminated sediment from the river.
   The state probably will go ahead with the dredging project, he
said. But the Michigan State findings ``cause us to hope for a
system that might be useful for hot spots we can't deal with'' by
dredging.
   ``It could in some cases make dredging unnecessary,'' said
environmental chemist Stephen A. Boyd, one of the Michigan State
authors reporting on the work in the issue of Science magazine
published today.
   He said that for dredging and other removal projects that do go
ahead, ``it would certainly lessen the risk-to-benefit ratio,'' that
is, make the work less risky than believed up to now.
   The work of Boyd and co-authors James M. Tiedje and John F.
Quensen confirms a theory advanced in 1987 by General Electric
Corp., whose legal dumping of PCB waste at Fort Edward and Hudson
Falls, N.Y., from 1951 to 1973 is the source of most Hudson River
PCBs.
   There are 209 possible PCB compounds. Each contains one to 10
chlorine atoms. GE noted that PCB sediments in the Hudson had lost
chlorine, and the proportion with only one or two atoms had
increased over what was put in the river.
   GE theorized that oxygen-free bacteria probably were responsible,
but New York government scientists said there could have been other
causes, including the possibility that sediment containing the
high-chlorine forms was washing away faster. An administrative law
judge recommended rejection of GE's proposal to leave the sediments
undisturbed in favor of a state proposal for dredging.
   The Department of Environmental Conservation expects to decide in
early January whether to go ahead with the dredging.
   Steve Hamilton, organic chemist at GE's labs in Schenectady,
N.Y., said, ``We feel pretty good'' about the confirmation of GE's
theory by the Michigan State team. He noted that PCB-laden sediments
in harbors at New Bedford, Mass., and Waukegan, Ill., have shown
similar changes but have not been studied in detail.
   GE contributed financially to the Michigan State research, but
Boyd said, ``That doesn't mean they hired us to state something they
wanted said.''
   Boyd, Tiedje and Quensen said the process works best on high
concentrations of PCBs. Sediment was doped to 700 parts per million
concentration of a commercial PCB mixture containing no
single-chlorine molecules, 9 percent with two chlorine atoms, 48
percent with three and 36 percent with four. After 16 weeks it had
changed into a mixture in which 67 percent of the molecules had no
chlorine, 21 percent had one atom, 8 percent had two and 3 percent
had three.
   Less-contaminated samples showed less change, prompting a word of
caution from the researchers.
   Since concentrations as high as 700 ppm are rare, ``I have
questions about the rates at which this process proceeds,'' Banks
said. The researchers noted that river samples range from 50 ppm to
562 ppm.
   Congress required EPA to act against PCBs because of reports of
cancer, skin disorders and reproductive damage in laboratory animals.
   Before the danger was widely known, PCBs were valued for their
ability to resist fire and act as electrical insulators. Millions of
pounds were used before EPA banned manufacture in 1977.
   Spills, discharges into rivers and equipment renovation have made
PCB contamination a massive headache for American industry _
utilities, for example, must replace transformer fluids containing
PCBs by the early 1990s.
   Up to now, incineration or burying in landfills had been the only
available techniques. The Michigan State researchers said it should
be possible to develop a new, two-step process using oxygen-free
bacteria to remove most of the chlorine, then employing normal
oxygen-using bacteria to remove the last one or two chlorine atoms.
The result should be substances that don'taccumulate in living
tissues.

   The University of Massachusetts Student
Senate has barred an avowed communist and his cohort from the
Student Government Association offices they were elected to head.
   Jason Rabinowitz and Shari Silkoff were elected co-presidents of
the student body last March, but the 47-44 vote by the Student
Senate on Wednesday prohibits them from using the title of
co-president.
   Conservatives on the Student Senate contend that two people
cannot not hold one office under the campus constitution.
   ``I think the Student Senate sent a clear message to them that
they aren't co-presidents,'' said Brian Darling, one of the sponsors
of motions to oust Rabinowitz, a member of the Young Communist
League, and Silkoff from office.
   A motion on a new election will be taken up at a Student Senate
meeting Wednesday.
   Silkoff, a self-proclaimed progressive, said after the vote:
``Most of them are new senators and for them to comprehend
everything that has gone on is impossible.''

<TEXT>
   The next U.S. president will have his hands
full trying to keep pace with Mikhail Gorbachev and finding a
formula for Mideast peace.
   The fast-moving Soviet leader is not only trying to restructure
the Soviet economy. He is permitting a diversity of views unknown in
his country since the 1917 Revolution.
   The next U.S. president must figure out how to encourage
democratic developments in a way that is consistent with American
security interests. If he goes too far, he risks leading the people
in Russia, the Baltics and Eastern Europe to expect U.S. help that
might not be there in the event of a crisis.
   The absence of a U.S. response _ apart from angry rhetoric _ to
the Soviet crackdown in Czechoslovakia in 1968 shows how limited
U.S. action might be despite cheering on democratic trends.
   But there are many steps to consider on the economic, arms
control and human rights fronts that could have an enormous impact
on living conditions.
   Will the United States provide easy credits to assist Communist
regimes in adopting Western techniques? Will arms control get the
kind of support that could take pressure off the Soviet _ and U.S. _
military? Will the United States condition its economic assistance
on tangible improvements in Soviet living standards?
   Four U.S.-Soviet summit meetings since 1985 have established a
basis for better superpower relations. As the Reagan administration
winds down, however, strains have developed over a Siberian radar
facility and new Soviet missiles and warplanes in Afghanistan.
   When the Soviets asked for a meeting in Geneva to discuss
Krasnoyarsk, U.S. officials hoped they might finally agree to
destroy the radar facility. President Reagan has complained the
radar violates the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
   But the Soviets made no such offer, and the State Department
threatened to take ``proportionate'' steps or to declare Krasnoyarsk
a ``material breach'' of the treaty.
   U.S. officials disclosed the Pentagon had circulated
recommendations within the government that include deploying a
limited ballistic missile defense or reversing the planned
dismantling of three Poseidon nuclear submarines.
   The dispute over Krasnoyarsk and U.S. retaliation could weaken
U.S.-Soviet arms control efforts even as the two sides are within
range of an agreement to reduce their long-range nuclear weapons.
   A U.S. declaration that Krasnoyarsk breaches the 1972 treaty
could lead to the unraveling of the accord, a landmark in arms
control.
   In Afghanistan, meanwhile, the State Department every day this
week has denounced the Soviets for shipping in new weapons. Half the
Red Army withdrew by Aug. 15, as promised in last Spring's Geneva
accord. But the administration is concerned the Soviets are
imperiling a political settlement between rival factions and
intimidating Pakistan, besides.
   In the Middle East, the muddled situation in Israel after
Tuesday's national elections could require a shift in U.S.
diplomatic tactics.
   They have been based on trying to persuade Israel to surrender
territory in exchange for Arab recognition _ and to elicit the
promise from Jerusalem even before peace talks are held.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir refused, despite four trips
to the region this year by Secretary of State George P. Shultz. If
Shamir heads the new Israeli government, which may take two months
to restructure, there is no reason to expect him to change his mind.
   That means either letting the situation fester, which most U.S.
analysts consider dangerous, or trying another approach. One would
be concentrating U.S. pressure on the Palestinians and Jordan to
negotiate with Israel without preconditions. The other would be a
joint U.S.-Soviet formula for peace talks. But Shamir, ever
apprehensive of Moscow's intervention, is likely to resist.

   A multimillionaire who nearly died from a
heart attack 22 years ago has spent $2 million on a crusade to
pressure food industry giants into making healthier products, but
the companies say his criticisms are misguided.
   Phil Sokolof, 65, placed advertisments in newspapers this week
depicting nine products he says are portrayed as healthy foods, but
are ``poisoning'' Americans with saturated fats.
   They include Nabisco's Triscuit crackers, Procter & Gamble's
Crisco shortening, Kellogg's Cracklin' Oat Bran cereal, Pepperidge
Farm's Goldfish crackers, Keebler's Club crackers, Sunshine's Hydrox
cookies and non-dairy coffee creamers Coffee Swirl from Kraft,
Carnation's Coffeemate and Borden's Creamora.
   Saturated fats have the effect of boosting the blood's
cholesterol level, according to scientists. An excess of
cholesterol, a waxy compound, can clog arteries, thereby
contributing to heart attacks.
   The American Heart Association recommends a daily diet with no
more than 30 percent of calories from fats and no more than 10
percent from saturated fats.
   Sokolof, the owner of a construction equipment company, blames
high cholesterol for the near-fatal heart attack he suffered in 1966
at the age of 43. His father and a brother-in-law died of heart
attacks.
   ``There were no warnings,'' he said. ``I was thin. I exercised. I
didn't smoke. The only thing wrong was I had high cholesterol.''
   In 1985, he wrote a $1 million check to establish the National
Heart Savers Association. He has spent another $1 million to spread
his warning about high cholesterol.
   Heart Savers is registered in Nebraska as a non-profit
organization. Sokolof has provided 99 percent of its funds and is
the only staff member, he said.
   Sokolof said his brush with death, combined with a 1984
government study on cholesterol, prompted his effort.
   ``It is a crusade. It is from the heart,'' he said Thursday.
   But the targeted companies said the advertisements that ran
Tuesday in The New York Times and New York Post were unfair and
misrepresented their products.
   ``It's irresponsible,'' Joseph Stewart, a senior vice president
for Kellogg's in Battle Creek, Mich., said Thursday. ``For someone
to claim it is the poisoning of the American public is a gross
exaggeration.''
   Sokolof's biggest beef is with companies that portray their foods
as healthy by proclaiming ``no cholesterol,'' ``low salt,''
``non-dairy,'' and ``made with 100 percent vegetable shortening.''
   ``McDonald's still serves 30 million people a day, but when you
eat a McDonald's hamburger, you expect to get eight or 10 grams of
fat,'' he said. ``Other people are selling foods that are inferred
to be a health food.''
   The chief culprits, Sokolof said, are palm and coconut oils,
which are highly saturated even though they are vegetable oils.
Companies use the oils because they are the most expeditious way to
extend shelf life, he said.
   Particularly upsetting to him is Cracklin' Oat Bran cereal.
   ``They (Kellogg's) came to market with Oat Bran because everyone
wants to eat oat bran to lower their cholesterol,'' Sokolof said.
``But it has coconut oil in it, which has 100 percent more saturated
fat than lard. It is worse than cholesterol.''
   He also singled out Crisco, advertised as an all-vegetable
shortening with no cholesterol. ``It has no cholesterol, but it does
have palm oil, which is high in saturated fat and again worse than
cholesterol,'' he said.
   Cholesterol itself is only found in animal products, including
meat and dairy items like cheese, whole milk and eggs.
   Kellogg's Stewart said Sokolof's ads ``confuse legitimate efforts
to educate people about the cholesterol problem.'' Fats, he said,
are a necessary part of a healthy diet.
   If consumers believe Sokolof, he said, they should eliminate
every product that contains fat, including cheese, whole milk, beef,
chicken and pork.
   ``They all have saturated fat,'' he said.
   Sokolof counters that Kellogg's is making light of the fact that
the cereal contains 3.7 grams of coconut oil serving.
   ``If you eat it for one meal of your life, that would be fine,''
he said. ``But they are providing food for millions of people who
eat it every morning. You are talking about thousands of gallons of
fat. You're talking vats of fat.''
   Ann Wainright of Pepperidge Farm said her company recently began
using 100 percent soybean oil in all its breads.
   ``The elimination of coconut and palm oils in our cracker and
cookie products is a high priority,'' she said.
   Joe Simrany, vice president of marketing for Sunshine, said
Sunshine had removed coconut oil from most of its products and wants
to eliminate all tropical oils.
   ``National Heart Savers was aware of these efforts, but
apparently they chose to ignore them,'' Simrany said. ``Recently,
even in Hydrox, we have eliminated palm oil.''
   Sokolof said he will continue placing ads.
   ``Kellogg's isn't going to listen to me, but if they get enough
flak from the American people, they are going to change the
formula,'' he said.

<HEAD>USDA Proposes To Ease Inspections Of Some Meat Processing Plants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department is proposing to get
tougher on inspections of the most troublesome meat and poultry
processing plants but ease up on those with good records.
   The prospective changes, announced on Thursday, were welcomed by
the industry as an improvement in the inspection program's focus.
   But consumer and labor groups assailed it, saying it would be
like putting ``the fox in charge of the chicken coop.''
   Thousands of plants that make hotdogs, beef stew, luncheon meats
and scores of other processed items that include meat and poultry
would be involved in the proposed program.
   Over time, officials estimated, the USDA's inspection force of
about 2,200 employees at the affected plants would be reduced by
half by retirements and resignations.
   The changes ``would strengthen USDA's inspection in the 6,300
plants that process meat and poultry by focusing inspection efforts
where they are needed most,'' said Lester M. Crawford, head of the
department's Food Safety and Inspection Service.
   Crawford said the proposal would put into effect the Processed
Products Inspection Act of 1986. The law allows the new targeted
inspection program to operate only for six years, at which time it
would be reviewed by Congress before being renewed.
   ``Under the proposal, USDA would increase inspection at
processing plants where records indicate a need for additional
oversight,'' he said. ``By the same token, plants with good records
of compliance could be visited less than daily.''
   The program could begin by mid-1989, but it likely would take
several years for the policy shift to be completed.
   Slaughter plants, where livestock and poultry are killed, would
not be affected by the plan. Those plants still would be under
continuous inspection.
   Department officials, who once called the program ``discretionary
inspection'' of processing plants, changed the name in the proposal
to ``improved processing inspection.''
   The proposal was hailed by a major industry organization, the
American Meat Institute, and criticized harshly by spokesmen for
consumers and labor.
   In a statement, the AMI said the proposal ``would adopt the
risk-based approach advocated by the National Academy of Sciences''
and would focus inspection ``at those critical points in the process
that pose the greatest risk to public health.''
   Crawford said the proposed program would use new computerized
information gathered during plant visits by USDA inspectors to
document each plant's record. Based on these records, the agency
would decide how often a plant would be personally checked by
federal inspectors.
   ``It would be like putting the fox in charge of the chicken
coop,'' said Rodney E. Leonard, head of the Community Nutrition
Institute, a non-profit Washington-based consumer watchdog agency.
   Leonard said the original intent of the 1906 federal meat
inspection program has to be considered, and that was to protect the
public's health.
   ``The companies (at that time), because they were not restrained
from selling food that would injure the public, sold foods that
injured the public,'' Leonard said in a telephone interview. ``The
whole idea of inspection is to put an individual, representing my
interests, in plants to do for me what I would do if I was there,
which is to ensure that no one is going to be exposed to products
that will injure or lead to an earlier death.''
   Allen Zack of the United Food and Commercial Workers
International said USDA's proposal appeared similar to the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration's policy of targeting
inspections to companies with poor safety records.
   ``What we discovered with that inspection program was that
companies lied on their records,'' he said. ``And so inspections (by
OSHA) were not done. As a result we've had a tragic increase in
safety and health problems (for workers) in meat packing, poultry in
particular.''
   Zack said he feared that history would repeat itself under USDA's
proposal for targeted meat inspections at processing plants.
   ``The danger here is that the size of the public that is going to
be exposed to these types of hazards is much larger,'' he said.
``It's not just the workers who work on the products, it's going to
be all the consumers who buy them.''
   Written public comments on the proposal can be submitted until
Feb. 2 to: Policy Office, Attn: Linda Carey, FSIS Hearing Clerk,
USDA, Washington, D.C. 20250.

<HEAD>Lyng Plans Meeting With EEC Officials On Trade Issues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng says he
is headed for Europe later this month for ``one last series of
meetings'' with the European Economic Community on a range of
contentious agricultural trade issues.
   Lyng said that after Jan. 20, when the new administration takes
office, he hopes to hang up his government spurs and take it easy.
   But for now, Lyng said in an interview Thursday, he will keep
pushing on international trade and will be in Brussels around
mid-month with U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter and chief
U.S. agricultural trade negotiator Daniel Amstutz.
   No firm dates have been set for the EEC talks, however, Yeutter's
office said.
   International trade, particularly involving the EEC and Japan,
has been at the top of Lyng's list of priorities all long, he said.
And that includes trade liberalization negotiations under the
96-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   Lyng said the difficult parts of GATT negotiations ``relate to
the attitudes and problems with Japan, particularly on rice,'' and
the EEC _ primarily concerning its Common Agricultural Policy, high
support prices and export subsidies.
   One of the most immediate and pressing problems Lyng hopes to
address in his talks with EEC officials is the 12-nation bloc's
determination to ban imports of meat containing growth-promoting
hormones beginning Jan. 1, 1989.
   ``They're insisting they're going to implement that ban on Jan.
1,'' Lyng said. ``That would be a very serious problem for us.''
   U.S. livestock interests have estimated an EEC ban would cost
$130 million a year in lost trade, primarily in variety meats
popular on the European market. The EEC says the ban on meat
hormones is designed to ensure consumer safety.
   The Meat Industry Trade Policy Council, which includes a number
of farm, business and commodity organizations, has asked the Reagan
administration to use authority under the new trade law to cut off
meat imports from the EEC if the Jan. 1 ban goes into effect.
   Lyng said also that he, Yeutter and other U.S. trade officials
will attend the special meeting of the 96 member countries of GATT,
which will begin Dec. 5 in Montreal.
   After the next administration takes over, Lyng, 70, said he plans
to take it easy.
   ``We have no plans to move (from the Washington area), but we
haven't made a commitment to stay where we are,'' he said. ``Have no
plans whatsoever.''
   There may be some ``special part-time jobs'' that come up from
time to time, he said, but added, ``I really want to take life at a
much slower pace.''

   The Soviet Union has bought 535,000 metric tons
of U.S. soybean meal for delivery in the 1988-89 marketing year that
began Oct. 1, says the Agriculture Department.
   Earlier this week, the Soviets bought 250,000 tons of soybeans
for 1988-89 delivery, the first of the new season.
   Although no further details were included in Thursday's
announcement, the meal sales could have a value of more than $120
million, based on average USDA market estimates of around $225 per
ton in the current marketing year.
   The Soviet Union bought more than 830,000 tons of soybeans and
1.3 million tons of soybean meal in 1987-88.

   Holiday shoppers will find adequate supplies of
turkey and plenty of ham, according to Agriculture Department
analysts.
   ``Prices will likely be higher for turkey and lower for ham than
last year,'' the department's Economic Research Service said
Thursday. ``Cold storage stocks of turkeys on Oct. 1 were 11 percent
below the record level of 1987 and will be drawn down further by
holiday demands and a fourth-quarter production under last year's
level.''
   Pork production is up about 9 percent this year, the agency said
in a new outlook report. But the rise in output is slackening and
may only average about 1 percent higher over all of 1989.
   ``As of Sept. 1, there were 5 percent more market hogs than a
year ago'' in the major pork states, the report said. ``Farrowing
intentions for September-November and December-February indicate a
moderate production increase in first-half 1989.''

<HEAD>Government Says Airlines' On-Time Performances Are Improving</HEAD>

   Despite a steady increase in air traffic,
airlines are cutting delays and there are signs that safety is
improving, according to the Transportation Department.
   The department said Thursday the major airlines have had at least
four out of every five flights arrive on time in each of the last
six months, including an 85.6 percent on-time record in September,
the best since the monthly figures became available 13 months ago.
   Complaints from air travelers to DOT's consumer affairs office
also continued their downward trend. The 1,370 complaints received
in October was 28 percent fewer than the 1,897 received in September
and 62 percent fewer than the 3,635 registered in October 1987, the
DOT said.
   At the same time, the department said, many of the ``safety
indicators'' show marked improvements this year.
   According to DOT figures, the number of near-collision reports by
pilots has dropped by 35 percent from 864 to 560 during the first
nine months of the year compared with the same period in l987. The
department did not say how many of the near-collision reports
involved commercial airlines.
   The number of air traffic controller errors, in which planes fly
closer than legally allowed, declined by 15 percent from 953 in the
first nine months of 1987 to 808 during the same period this year.
   ``The statistics indicate that our efforts to improve airline
safety and service to consumers are reaping dividends,'' said
Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley in a statement. ``They are
especially significant given that they come at a time of steadily
growing air traffic.''
   Nevertheless, officials acknowledge that there continue to be
pockets of concern in some parts of the country about air traffic
volume, controllers working long hours and too many controller
flight-handling errors.
   Last month the Federal Aviation Administration clamped tighter
traffic curbs on the Chicago airports, including O'Hare
International, because errors by Chicago controllers soared to 30
during the first 10 months of the year, compared to only 12 in all
of l987.
   The reduction of flights in and out of Chicago in turn has caused
increasing delay problems at O'Hare as well as at Chicago's smaller
Midway, which has added to delays at other airports, airline
officials have said.
   Burnley also has said that air traffic controllers in facilities
in New York, Atlanta and Los Angeles _ as well as Chicago _ are
still working more overtime than he would like.
   But the monthly on-time statistics released Thursday covered
September before the Chicago traffic curbs went into effect. During
September just over 81 percent of O'Hare's flights arrived on time
and 87 percent departed on time, the government said.
   The Dallas-Fort Worth Airport had the best on-time record with
90.8 percent of its flights arriving within 15 minutes of schedule,
while Detroit had the worst record at 69 percent.
   The figures include weather-related delays, but not those caused
by mechanical problems. The department considers a flight to be on
time if it arrives within 15 minutes of schedule.
   Between April and September, the 13 largest airlines reported an
80 percent average on-time arrival rate in each of the six months,
compared with about 74 percent between October l987 and last March,
said the DOT.
   Eastern Airlines, which throughout the year has ranked in the
bottom half of the group of airlines reporting on-time statistics,
soared to No. 1 among major air carriers in September with 90.5
percent of its flights on time.
   America West, largely a regional carrier with its hub in Phoenix,
had the overall best record with nearly 93 percent of it flights on
time, just ahead of Eastern. Northwest Airlines had the worst record
for September with 75.8 percent of its flights arriving on time.
   The airlines, meanwhile, reported receiving 5.71 reports of
mishandled baggage per 1,000 passengers carried in September, down
from 7.03 reports per 1,000 in August. The best previous month had
been May, when there were 6.16 reports per 1,000 passengers.

<HEAD>State Senator Tackles Car Thief In Early Morning Bust</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Louisiana state senator used tips from his
constituents to help police track down and recover his stolen car,
then chased and tackled one of the suspected thieves.
   ``I think people have to get involved to protect themselves or
they'll continue to be victims,'' said Sen. Ben Bagert.
   The New Orleans Democrat said his wife discovered that her own
car was ransacked and his car was missing Sunday morning. Bagert
said he put the word on the streets in his district that his car had
been stolen and soon began getting calls from tipsters.
   One constituent from Bagert's district, which includes affluent
and poverty-stricken areas, said he wanted to help because the
senator had done him a favor, Bagert said.
   ``The guy who started giving me the leads said they were getting
ready to cut it (the car) up pretty soon,'' he said.
   Using the man's information, Bagert drove to a spot where he
found his parked car covered with a tarpaulin. He called police, who
urged him to stay home. But they eventually allowed Bagert to
accompany them early Monday on a search for suspects.
   They failed to find the suspects at a grocery store parking lot
where tipsters said they had been seen. But when they hurried back
to the spot where the senator's car was parked, they spotted three
men driving off in it.
   The suspects saw the police, got out of the car and ran. Bagert,
clad in shorts, T-shirt and tennis shoes, ran after them along with
three police officers.
   Bagert tackled one of the suspects, police caught another one and
one escaped, according to Bagert, whose story was confirmed by
police.
   ``Cops and robbers at 4 o'clock in the morning,'' said Bagert.
``It was fun.''

   John Joseph Lindsay, the Senate reporter for
Newsweek magazine, died of cancer at his home in Washington. He was
67.
   Lindsay, who died Wednesday, had worked for The Washington Post
for eight years before joining Newsweek's Washington bureau in 1962.
He covered political nominating conventions and the campaigns of
major candidates in every election since 1952.
   He also covered the Watergate scandal, the National Governors
Association, the national committees of both the Republican and
Democratic parties, and the investigations into the assassinations
of President John F. Kennedy and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.
   He covered the White House during the Johnson administration and
accompanied President Nixon on his 1972 trip to China.
   Lindsay was a native of Westboro, Mass., and served in the Army
from 1940 to 1946. He began his journalism career with the Bangor
Evening and Sunday Commercial in Maine after his discharge from the
Army and joined the Post in 1954.
   He was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University in 1957-58.
   Survivors include his wife, Lorraine Lindsay of Washington, and
two children.

<TEXT>
   Terrified residents of
earthquake-scarred Central America and southern Mexico ran into the
streets Thursday when a strong temblor rattled the region. One death
and minor damage was reported.
   Later Thursday, a strong earthquake shook buildings and sent
people into the streets in Puerto Rico, but an official said there
were no immediate reports of damage or injuries in the Caribbean
island.
   The Central American quake was felt at 8:47 a.m..
   About 12 hours later, at 8:43 p.m., another earthquake measuring
4.2 on the Richter scale rattled Guatemala, the National
Seismological Institute there reported. Its epicenter was about 70
miles southeast of Guatemala City, the capital, in the Pacific Ocean.
   There were no immediate reports of casualties or damages.
   In Mexico Thursday morning, residents of the southern town of
Tapachula thought the local volcano was erupting. In San Salvador,
where a 1986 earthquake killed 1,500 and injured 20,000, thousands
of people took to the streets in panic.
   The first quake also was felt in Guatemala, where the National
Emergency Committee went on alert, and to a lesser extent in
Honduras and Nicaragua. A 1972 earthquake killed 10,000 people in
Nicaragua and caused extensive damage to Managua, the capital.
   Readings on the tremor varied. The U.S. Geological Survey in
Golden, Colo., said it measured 6 on the Richter scale. The
Institute of Seismology at the University of Costa Rica said it
measured 6.5.
   An earthquake with a magnitude of 6 on the Richter scale is
capable of doing serious damage. The Richter scale is an open-ended
gauge of energy released by an earthquake as measured by ground
motion recorded on a seismograph.
   In Guatemala City, the Guatemalan capital, a municipal worker
digging a ditch was buried alive when the quake dislodged a pile of
earth, police said. The man was identified as Jesus Pitan, 50.
   Maj. Humberto Fuentes Soria of Guatemala's National Emergency
Committee said the temblor damaged 18 homes in the western provinces
of Totonicapan and Chimaltenango. He said walls cracked in several
public buildings in western provinces.
   In Puerto Rico, the 3:42 p.m. quake measured 5.7 on the Richter
scale, said William MacCann, director of the University of Puerto
Rico's Seismological Network. An aftershock measuring 4 on Richter
scale followed, he said.
   McCann said earthquake was the strongest in Puerto Rico since
1979, when a temblor of 5.9 shook the island.
   He said the quake's epicenter was in the Atlantic Ocean in the
extreme northwestern port city of Aguadilla, 80 miles west of San
Juan. But the tremor was felt throughout the island, which is 100
miles long and 35 miles wide.
   The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake in Puerto Rico measured
5.5 on the Richter scale.
   The quake in Central America and southern Mexico was centered in
the Pacific Ocean about 60 miles off El Salvador, the Geological
Survey said, and about 70 miles south and east of Guatemala City.
   The ground shook for at least 30 seconds in the Salvadoran
capital of San Salvador, about 25 miles from the coast, and people
fled high-rise buildings. At the international airport, travelers
braced themselves or fled for the exits amid cries of ``Oh my god.
It's an earthquake.''
   The Costa Rican seismology institute reported that a second
temblor registering 4.8 on the Richter scale shook San Salvador and
Santa Ana, El Salvador's second largest city 25 miles northeast of
San Salvador, at 9:19 a.m.
   The Guatemala City seismological institute reported the second
earthquake occurred at 9:17 a.m., measured 4.7 on the Richter scale
and had the same epicenter as the first quake.
   In Tapachula, a coastal town in southern Mexico about 125 miles
northwest of Guatemala City, people thought the 13,310-foot Tacana
Volcano was erupting, the Excelsior news service said.
   The volcano is in Chiapas state, which borders Guatemala. The
Tacubaya National Seismological Institute in Mexico City said the
earthquake also was felt in the southern states of Oaxaca and
Veracruz.
   The earth shook for at least 70 seconds in Tapachula, a city of
about 200,000, the report said.
   The monitoring center in Costa Rica said the quake was along a
fault line that runs from Mexico to the border between Costa Rica
and Panama on the Pacific Ocean.

<HEAD>Emperor's Fever Increases, Further Bleeding Feared</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emperor Hirohito's fever increased slightly today as
palace doctors feared the monarch's continued high temperature might
lead to further internal bleeding.
   The temperature of the world's longest-reigning monarch was 100.6
F, up slightly from the previous evening. Hirohito's normal
temperture is about 95.9 F.
   Doctors fear the continuous high fever might lead to further
bleeding in Hirohito's upper intestinal area, where physicians
conducted a bypass operation in September 1987, news reports said
today.
   Palace spokesman Kenji Maeda said the emperor's fever could
``largely be attributed to the blood transfusions'' conducted almost
daily, but doctors are now also concerned that worsening
inflammation around the upper intestine was keeping Hirohito's
temperature high.
   Physicians have stopped giving the 87-year-old monarch
antibiotics because continuous use of the drugs could damage kidney
and liver functions. But news reports said doctors are considering
resuming the medication to alleviate infection and reduce the risk
of further bleeding.
   The bedridden monarch, who has not discharged blood since
Thursday, has received 34.2 pints of transfusions since he fell
seriously ill and vomited blood on Sept. 19.

   A computer virus infected systems from MIT to Caltech on
Thursday, afflicting major universities and federal research
centers, including NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, but officials
said they were unaware of any damage.
   The bug infected hundreds of computers but apparently didn't
destroy any files or research, said Professor James Bruce, vice
president for information systems at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in Cambridge, Mass.
   ``We're not crippled,'' Bruce said. ``It first showed up in the
middle of the night and spread very virulently during the day.''
   The virus had slowed or halted dozens of computers at the
California Institute of Technology in Pasadena by Thursday morning,
but caused no permanent damage, said Bob Logan, systems manager of
Caltech's computing organization.
   Some of the institutions affected were investigating the
incident, but there was no known criminal probe underway.
   Viruses, the communicable diseases of computers, are tiny
programs which are created in computers either as a joke or
vandalism. They can attach themselves to other programs and spread
through shared software.
   In their mildest form, a message flashes on a user's screen; as
malignancies, they can destroy data and cripple a computer.
   ``This (virus) program tries to find all the machines it can talk
to, copies itself into those machines, and then it starts doing the
same thing again,'' Logan said.
   Caltech experts believe the virus entered their computers through
ARPANET, a network established by the Defense Department's Advanced
Research Projects Agency.
   ``ARPANET is a nationwide computer network that ... reaches to
just about every university in the United States,'' Caltech
spokesman Bob Finn said. ``It lets researchers communicate data and
text very easily.''
   Spokesmen at Boston University, Stanford University, Colorado
University and the NASA-Ames Research Center in Mountain View,
Calif., also said their systems had been infected.
   ``This is electronic vandalism,'' said John Porter, associate
provost at Boston University.
   At the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, in Livermore,
Calif., spokesman Jeff Garberson said a computer problem was
discovered late Wednesday.
   ``We ... took action to contain it, which means to stop it from
spreading to other computer systems. We were successful by about 1
in the morning,'' about five hours after it was discovered.
   ``This is for unclassified, non-secured systems,'' said
Garberson. ``It did not affect our classified national defense
system at all.''
   The lab's work includes design of the nation's nuclear weapons
and key work in the Strategic Defense Initiative. ``We are now
powering back up and should have all these unclassified systems back
on line by tomorrow,'' Garberson said.
   ``It was benign it that it didn't cause any damage,'' said Gerard
Newman, a member of the technical staff at the San Diego Super
Computer Center at the University of California, San Diego. `` But
it was incredibly prolific _ it attempted to find as many computers
as it could to infect. It slowed three systems here.''
   At Stanford in Palo Alto, Calif., the virus ``was mainly just
slowing down systems and slowing data. ... It just chokes computers.
... Our people are saying no data were destroyed,'' said Bob Beyers,
a school spokesman.
   The New York Times in its Friday editions, said unidentified
computer security analysts were calling the virus ``the largest
assault ever on the nation's computers.''
   The Times said the virus apparently was released by a computer
graduate student trying to sneak what he thought was a harmless
virus onto ARPANET, where the program was supposed to remain
undetected.
   The Times said an anonymous caller identifying himself as an
associate of the student called the newspaper and said the virus
went awry because of a programming error that caused it to replicate
itself much faster than intended.
   ``The student realized his error shortly after letting the
program loose and ... was now terrified of the consequences,'' the
Times said.
   The Defense Communications Agency set up an emergency center to
deal with the problem, the newspaper said.
   ``This has the feel of somebody who was sitting around thinking
one night over a beer, `Hey, I can write a virus. Let's see what
happens,''' said Charley Kline, senior research programmer with the
Computing Services Office at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign, Ill.
   Kline said he uses the term ``virus'' to mean a self-spreading
program, though some call such a program a ``worm'' unless it does
damage. He said he knew of no damage caused by the program Thursday.
   Kline said university officials disconnected their computers from
outside networks about 8 a.m. CST, when the virus was discovered,
and connected them again about noon when the system apparently was
purged of the invading program.
   Contact with other universities showed the virus also infected
computers at Boston University, Purdue University, the University of
Wisconsin at Madison and the University of California at Berkeley,
Kline said.
   ``This is the first time that I know of that it (virus infection)
has happened on this scale to larger systems,'' Kline said.
   Kline said the virus traveled between computer systems through a
process in which computer operators usually send ``electronic mail''
to each other.
   He said once the messages were received, they linked up to
command controls, and told the local computer to make copies of the
virus. He said the copies then sought out other connected machinery.
   He said that as far as he knows, only locations using VAX
computers, made by Digital Equipment of Maynard, Mass.; or Sun
computers made by Sun Microsystems Inc., of California, were
affected.
   Kline estimated that about 75 percent of all national networks
use such computers.
   All of the affected computers use the same operating system, or
master program, that allows a computer to run other programs, Logan
said.
   The operating system, named BSD UNIX, was written by University
of California, Berkeley, computer experts and is a modified version
of the UNIX operating system produced by American Telephone &
Telegraph, he said.
   Logan said he believes the virus came through the ARPANET
connection because at least some of the times the virus entered
Caltech's computers Wednesday night, it came from computers at
NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif,. and at
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory In Berkeley.
   All the computers are connected by ARPANET, he said.
   The virus also infected a network called Science Internet that
serves many scientists and research labs, including NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, said JPL spokesman Jim Wilson.
   NASA's Science Internet office at Amers Research Center alerted
JPL computer specialists of the virus' presence in Internet shortly
after midnight Thursday, Wilson said in a prepared statement.
   ``Within an hour, JPL has disconnected from the NASA Science
Internet and also from MILNET and ARPANET, two other research and
development computer networks,'' Wilson said. ``No damage to
hardware, software or data was found.''
   He said a ``software patch'' was developed to protect against
this type of virus and the networks will be reconnected only after
the patch has been installed and tested, within a day.
   John McAfee, chairman of the Computer Virus Industry Association
in Santa Clara, Calif., said Thursday's virus was rare because it
infested computers at major institutions, not just personal
computers where most viruses are generated and duplicated.
   ``Any hacker in the world can infect personal computers,'' McAfee
said by telephone. ``But in this case, the person who did this would
have had to have been physically at the site of one of the computers
belonging to the network.''
   He said chances of identifying that person were ``extremely
slim.''

   A group of import car dealers is spending
upwards of $1 million on a last-minute boost for Republicans in four
closely contested Senate races, and Democrats say that in one case _
Florida _ the spending is illegal.
   ``These foreign car dealers are running a national political
campaign, complete with a web of pollsters, media and direct-mail
consultants, time buyers and other political operatives, all over
the country,'' charged Bob Chlopak, director of the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee.
   The ads, polls and direct-mail appeals are being paid for by the
Auto Dealers and Drivers for Free Trade political action committee,
based in Jamaica, N.Y. The group, described in a PAC guide as
representing mostly dealers of Japanese cars, says it seeks to
promote election of lawmakers who oppose import restrictions.
   The group is supporting the re-election bids of Sens. Chic Hecht
in Nevada and Malcolm Wallop in Wyoming, and is backing GOP
candidates in open seats in Florida and Mississippi, according to
documents filed with the Federal Election Commission.
   Chlopak called it the biggest effort by a single group to
influence Senate elections since 1980, when NCPAC _ the National
Conservative Political Action Committee _ spent $1 million against
six Democratic incumbents. That much money poured into tight races
late in the campaign can take on undue importance, he said.
   ``Their last-minute communications blitz is sufficient to be
decisive,'' he said Thursday at a news conference.
   Special-interest PACs, by law, can give no more than $5,000
directly to a candidate in each primary or general election. But
there is no ceiling for independent expenditures _ those made in a
candidate's behalf without coordination or consultation with the
campaign.
   The Democratic campaign committee filed a formal complaint with
the FEC alleging that in the case of Florida, the import dealers'
blitz is not truly independent of the campaign of GOP candidate
Connie Mack. The same media buyer and direct-mail consultant used by
Mack also is being used by the dealers' group in other states.
   Robert Bauer, a lawyer for the Democratic committee, said such
sharing of agents creates a legal presumption that independence has
been violated and puts a burden on the dealers to prove they have
not engaged in collusion. He asked the FEC for a quick decision on
the complaint and for an injunction to remove the Florida spots from
the air.
   The chairman of the import dealers group, Tom Nemet, said in a
telephone interview that the group had adhered to the law, and he
accused the Democrats of attempting to intimidate his organization.
   According to FEC reports, the import dealers PAC is spending:
   _ $382,473 to support Hecht's effort to defend his seat against
Nevada Gov. Richard Bryan. The money is buying a last-minute blitz
of television advertising that includes positive spots for Hecht and
an attack on Bryan on the issue of Social Security. The group also
paid for a 650,000-piece mass mailing for Hecht in the past week.
   _ $311,550 to boost Mack, who is locked in a close race with
Democratic Rep. Buddy MacKay for the Florida seat of retiring Sen.
Lawton Chiles. The money is going for TV spots comparing Mack's and
MacKay's votes on taxes, and concludes: ``A vote for Connie Mack is
a vote for lower taxes.''
   _ $319,126 in Mississippi to blanket the state with positive
spots for Rep. Trent Lott, who is trying to capture the Senate seat
of retiring Democratic Sen. John Stennis. Lott is opposed by
Democratic Rep. Wayne Dowdy.
   _ $84,860 to support Wallop's re-election bid in Wyoming,
including positive TV spots that began on Tuesday and a
150,000-piece mass mailing.
   Frank Glacken, the PAC's executive director, said the group also
is supporting two House Democratic re-election bids, spending
$45,000 for Rep. Richard Stallings of Idaho and $85,000 for Rep.
David Skaggs of Colorado.
   The group has made direct contributions to a large number of
Democratic Senate incumbents, as well as $15,000 gifts in 1987 and
1988 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, he said.
   ``Primarily we want to go in and support people who are free
traders,'' Glacken said. ``While it looks like we're spending a lot
of money, labor unions give out millions,'' he said. He added that
the giving was partly an attempt to balance the money from labor,
which he said often advocates protectionist trade legislation.
   Glacken said the group receives its money from about 2,000 of the
4,500 people who own foreign car franchises in the United States. He
said contributors include both dealers of Japanese and European
cars, and he disputed published descriptions of the group as
dominated by dealers of Japanese vehicles.

   A businessman who moved an
impoverished family from Miami to the suburbs was sentenced in
federal court Thursday to a two-year prison term on a bank fraud
charge.
   James Gisclair, 43, got the maximum jail term and was sentenced
to five years probation at federal court, where he pleaded guilty in
September to falsifying work records to obtain bank loans for a
now-defunct company.
   Gisclair, who must serve at least six months before he is
eligible for parole, also has been ordered to pay a $1.5 million
civil penalty on the charges.
   The Boca Raton businessman was besieged by creditors after his
much-publicized promise to ``adopt'' Anita Hunter, 28, and her five
children.
   The family was moved from Miami's impoverished Overtown section
to Delray Beach, but Ms. Hunter was unable to work because of
transportation and child-care difficulties.
   In September, the state Department of Health and Rehabilitative
Services put Ms. Hunter in a program that provides child care,
transportation to a job and federal rent subsidies. She now works in
an HRS office.

<HEAD>Early Look At Six-Year Fallout Study Reveals Nothing `Alarming'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PEG McENTEE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   An early look at a six-year study of the
health effects of radioactive fallout shows ``no strong evidence''
of a link between exposure and leukemia and thyroid disorders, the
project's director says.
   The $7 million study, funded by the National Cancer Institute, is
intended to determine whether people living downwind of above-ground
atomic bomb tests in Nevada in the 1950s and 1960s suffered an
increased rate of cancer.
   Because all the data has not been tabulated, it is not possible
to say definitely ``there is or is not an effect,'' said Dr. Walter
Stevens, interim dean of the University of Utah Medical School and
director of the study.
   However, he said Thursday there is ``no strong evidence that
would convince me ... that there was a relationship'' between
fallout and disease.
   Stevens emphasized that epidemiological findings still are being
analyzed and that no final conclusions would be drawn until a draft
report had been reviewed by the National Cancer Institute.
   The draft likely will be delivered to NCI by mid-November and the
finished report released next March, he said.
   For years, people living in southwestern Utah, southeastern
Nevada and northeastern Arizona have feared that exposure to about
80 open-air tests at the Nevada Test Site had increased the
potential for leukemia and thyroid cancers.
   In 1979, Dr. Joseph L. Lyon, an University of Utah epidemiologist
who is working on the current study, published a paper showing a
2.4-fold increase in childhood leukemia in the areas of southern
Utah heavily dusted by fallout.
   Meanwhile, nearly 1,200 people living downwind of the tests sued
the federal government, claiming that exposure to fallout caused
sickness and death. In 1982, U.S. District Judge Bruce Jenkins ruled
the government had failed to warn residents of radiation hazards.
   However, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the
ruling and the U.S. Supreme Court concurred, saying the government
was immune from damages.
   The latest study was conducted in two parts _ one for leukemia
and the other for thyroid disorders _ and was designed as the most
comprehensive undertaking of its kind.
   Researchers located the names of 1,177 people from all over Utah
who had died of leukemia between 1952 and 1966 and selected as
controls another 5,600 people who had died of other causes.
   The subjects were matched where possible in age, residence,
health and lifestyle to ensure valid comparisons, Stevens said.
   In the thyroid study, 2,829 subjects in southern Utah,
southeastern Nevada and southern Arizona were identified as having
been exposed, and about 280 were found to have thyroid abnormalities.
   Scientists closely researched production distribution and
consumption of milk, thought to be one of the primary ways children
might have ingested radioactive materials from fallout.
   Stevens said the research has been greatly aided by the release
of previously classified information from the Department of Energy
on the amount of radiation emitted by the tests.
   Stevens said the study could prove to be a milestone in research
on the effects of exposure to radiation, with particular
significance to safety concerns at the nation's nuclear production
plants.

<HEAD>The Moscow View: Dukakis In Trouble, And The Best Candidate Can't
Run</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Soviets have a clear favorite in next week's
U.S. presidential election. Unfortunately for them, his name is
Ronald Reagan, and the Constitution won't let him run again.
   As George Bush and Michael Dukakis make their last campaign
swings before Tuesday's election, Soviets are waxing nostalgic about
the outgoing eight-year tenant in the White House who once called
their country an ``evil empire'' and joked about bombing it into
oblivion.
   They are also looking ahead to a Bush victory, although without
apparent relish.
   ``To be quite frank, I can't say I've personally been carried
away by the statements of either Bush or Dukakis when they spoke of
Soviet-American relations,'' Nikolai V. Shishlin, a spokesman for
the Communist Party Central Committee, told a news briefing
Thursday. ``I think it's President Reagan who gave the best
statement a few days ago.''
   Reagan, once caricatured by the party daily Pravda as a
missile-toting cowboy, now is portrayed as a reliable bargaining
partner who sat down with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
negotiated a nuclear missile treaty and instigated negotiations in
Geneva for a 50 percent cut in strategic arms.
   But such expressions of respect don't mean Soviet officials have
fallen wholeheartedly for Reagan. Shishlin made a point of rejecting
outright his most recent pronouncement that the diplomatic warming
between Moscow and Washington was due to the Reagan administration
policy of negotiating ``from a position of strength.''
   Kremlin watchers have been hard-put to find a preference in
Soviet news accounts or official statements for either the
Republican vice president or the Democratic Massachusetts governor.
   ``We prefer the winner,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.
Gerasimov said Thursday when asked which candidate the Soviets
wanted to see in the White House.
   Gerasimov said the Soviets would like a prompt summit with the
next president of the United States, whoever he may be.
   Officials acknowledge their cautious non-partisanship is
motivated by fears that showing a preferance for one man could brand
him ``the Kremlin's candidate'' and doom his chances for election.
   ``Rival candidates will allegedly take advantage of our kind
words and try to discredit the opponent who `merited the praise' of
the Soviet press,'' wrote commentator Melor Sturua. ``Does anyone
seriously believe that the Soviet press can make or break U.S.
presidents? That is, to put it mildly, nonsense.''
   Sturua's article, published in the weekly Moscow News, blasted
Soviet media for overly cautious coverage of the U.S. race, and
included this unusual endorsement: ``Personally, I prefer Dukakis,
but I think Bush will win.''
   Such candor is rare but an indication of the new latitude
permitted for media that make no pretense of speaking with the voice
of the party or government.
   A telephone call Thursday to the official news agency Tass for a
copy of its most recent commentary on the U.S. presidential campaign
brought this reply from an editor: ``We have had no commentary. Why
should we? We don't want to interfere in another country's affairs.''
   That sensitivity to interfering in the internal politics of the
other superpower talk is a marked departure from previous practice
in the Soviet media's coverage of the race for the White House. In
1984, Tass condemned Reagan's decision to run for re-election,
saying his claim to have made the world safer was ``an obvious lie.''
   Reports showing Bush and Dukakis stumping are frequent fare on
Soviet television news programs, and recent reports have prepared
Soviets for a Bush victory by telling them that the Dukakis campaign
is in trouble.
   Maxim Knyazkov of the daily Sovietskaya Rossiya wrote Thursday:
``It seems to me that even at the final stage, (Dukakis') campaign
lacks solidity; it resembles not a carefully worked out
counteroffensive, but a feverish race after a hat blown away by the
wind. And when explaining to Americans why they should not vote for
Bush, Dukakis to my mind has failed to explain why they should vote
for him.''
   The Soviets have just had their own presidential elections, which
again highlighted the contrasting political systems of the
superpowers.
   With practically no warning, the Supreme Soviet, or parliament,
elected Gorbachev president on Oct. 1, naming him to replace the
retiring chief of state, Andrei A. Gromyko.
   The vote was 1,500-0 in Gorbachev's favor, and the Communist
Party chief never had to wear a funny hat or eat a blintz.

   Forty percent of the Brazilians drafted
for military service are rejected because of malnutrition, bad teeth
and other health problems, the army says.
   A report Thursday by the Army Military Service department said
701,000 Brazilians were drafted last year, but of that number,
281,000 failed to pass the physical exam.
   The report said 26 percent of the draftees were rejected for
dental problems, and 9 percent had height or weight deficiencies
caused by malnutrition.
   It also showed that recruits from southern Brazil, the country's
most developed region, were on the average 11 pounds heavier and 3
inches taller than those from the poor North and Northeast, where
most of the rejectees came from.
   The former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Waldyr de
Vasconcelos, was quoted as saying in the Rio de Janeiro newspaper
Jornal do Brasil that the report ``shows the Brazilian's quality of
life is bad and has not improved.''

<TEXT>
   The General Assembly reached unanimity
Thursday on Afghanistan, demanding a broad-based government and an
end to outside interference in Afghan affairs.
   The consensus resolution, sponsored by Pakistan and the Soviet
Union, passed by acclaimation.
   It says the war ``results from the violation of principles of the
Charter of the United Nations and of the recognized norms of
inter-state conduct,'' which could be interpreted as a slap at the
Soviets for entering Afghanistan or Moslem insurgents who operate
from bases in Pakistan.
   In previous years, the assembly overwhelmingly passed resolutions
calling for withdrawal of ``foreign forces'' from Afghanistan, with
the Soviet Union and its allies voting against.
   Moslem guerrillas began fighting in Afghanistan after a Communist
coup in April 1978 and Soviet military forces entered the country in
December 1979. The Soviets had an estimated 115,000 soldiers in the
country and began withdrawing May 15 under a U.N.-mediated agreement.
   In September, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze told
a U.N. news conference Pakistan was aiding the insurgents. He said
half the Soviet troops had withdrawn but the second phase of the
withdrawal depended on how the United Nations dealt with Moscow's
complaints.
   Ambassador Dante Caputo of Argentina, the General Assembly
president, said Thursday ``much remains to be done in order to
achieve a comprehensive solution of the Afghan question, including
the problem of the refugees and the difficulties in setting in
motion the necessary inter-Afghan dialogue aimed at establishing a
broad-based government acceptable to the Afghan people.''
   Before the war Afghanistan's population was about 15.5 million,
but about one-third have fled _ more than 3 million to Pakistan and
nearly all the others to Iran. Most of those in Pakistan live in
border cities and refugee camps that serve as bases and supply
points for the guerrillas.
   The United Nations has begun a program to resettle the refugees
and rebuild Afghanistan's shattered agricultural economy.
   Afghanistan's government invited the insurgents discuss a
coalition government, but they refused.
   Burhanuddin Rabbani, chairman of the seven-party guerrilla
alliance, said Thursday: ``The puppet regime is the shadow of the
Russian troops in Afghanistan. As soon as the Russian troops are out
of the country, the shadow will also disappear.''

<TEXT>
   The Pentagon hopes to save money on health care
for dependents and retirees by expanding many military hospitals'
capacity to treat them.
   The project is expected to cost the Army and Air Force $14.6
million but still save them $13.9 million compared with the cost of
paying to treat the dependents and retirees at civilian hospitals.
   Assistant Defense Secretary William Mayer decided to allow Army
and Air Force hospitals in 12 states to expand facilities or hire
additional nurses and other staff to provide more surgical,
obstetrics, gynecology, cardiology and psychiatry services. Similar
Navy projects are now under consideration.
   Military hospitals are required to serve dependents and retirees
on a space-available basis, giving first priority to men and women
on active duty.
   The states in which military hospitals will be expanded are
Georgia, Texas, Virginia, New Jersey, Kentucky, Kansas, Alaska,
Oklahoma, Utah, New York, Nebraska and Florida.

<HEAD>Iraq Offers Help In Detecting Chemical Weapons Use</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq, which acknowledged using poison gas
in its war with Iran, has agreed to help investigate allegations of
chemical warfare in the world, according to a U.N. document.
   The report by Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar on
chemical and biological weapons, released Thursday, includes the
responses of 17 nations that have offered the use of laboratories or
experts in chemical warfare to develop ways of detecting use of such
weapons.
   Iraq offered the services of two doctors, two chemists and a
pharmacologist, but said ``it is not possible for Iraqi laboratories
to be used'' in chemical and biological warfare investigations.
   Last summer, Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz was questioned
about alleged chemical warfare in the Persian Gulf war, and
responded that Iraq used such weapons only after Iran used them
first.
   Iran says it has the ability to make chemical weapons, but has
never used them. Investigations by U.N. experts confirmed that Iraq
used chemical weapons against Iran throughout the war, which began
in September 1980.

<HEAD>Black-White Infant Mortality Rate Gap Widens, Group Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A children's advocacy group says the gap
between the mortality rates for black and white infants born in the
United States is continuing to widen.
   The Children's Defense Fund, basing its study on data released by
the National Center for Health Statistics, a federal agency, said
Thursday it found a black-white infant mortality ratio of 2.02 in
1986, the most recent year for which figures were available.
   The findings mean a black baby was more than twice as likely to
die in infancy as a white baby. That compared to a 1.96 ratio in
1985 and 1.69 in 1940.
   It added that, while the death rates among black and white
infants for non-preventable birth defects was virtually identical,
black babies were far more likely to die of preventable causes such
as inadequate prenatal care.
   They were four times more likely to die of prematurity and low
birth weight, three times more likely to die of pneumonia, influenza
and homicide and two times more likely to die as a result of newborn
and maternal complications, infections and accidents, the fund said.
   Overall, the U.S. infant mortality rate declined slightly from
10.6 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1985 to 10.4 in 1986.
   The mortality rate for black infants in 1986 was 18 per 1,000
births and, for white infants, 8.9 per 1,000 births.

<TEXT>
   Do Americans blame the president or his party
for the weather? A case could be made _ at least statistically _
that they do.
   That's because, historically, droughts have tended to be followed
by a change in the party in charge of the White House.
   Eight times in this century the White House has changed party:
   _Four times in drier than normal years.
   _Four times in moist years that happened to come at the end of a
four-year term of drier than normal weather.
   Climate, thus, would seem to give an edge to Democrat Michael
Dukakis, although the polls indicate a lead for Republican George
Bush.
   Studies of the 1800s, when the nation was more economically
dependent on the farm population, show a regular pattern of
political upheavals at the White House in the wake of drought.
   This summer's drought came after a dry 1987 but followed several
relatively moist years before that.
   The pattern was similar _ though not as severe _ in the dry
season of 1980, when Republican Ronald Reagan ousted Democrat Jimmy
Carter.
   And Carter won office in 1976, a dry year that followed nearly a
decade of normal or above normal wetness, according to records kept
by the National Climatic Data Center.
   Republican Richard Nixon ended eight years of Democrats in the
White House in 1968, a year when rainfall was slightly above median,
but which followed dry years in 1966 and 1967.
   John F. Kennedy won in 1960, as three years of moist conditions
ended and the nation slipped into a slightly drier than normal
season.
   And 1952 marked the first dry season in eight years _ a year that
Dwight Eisenhower turned the Democrats out of the White House for
the first time in two decades.
   It was the famous Dust Bowl years of the 1930s that saw the
Democrats take up residence there, of course, with Franklin D.
Roosevelt winning the office.
   The GOP had captured the executive mansion in 1920, the second
straight moist year, but following a drought in 1917-18.
   In 1912 Democrat Woodrow Wilson took office, also in the second
year after a drought.
   In addition, it may have been clearing weather in California that
saved his second term.
   The 1916 election came just a day after a major storm struck the
Pacific Coast, delaying results from California which Wilson won by
a narrow margin. Wilson's win was helped by a strong vote in the
heavily Democratic counties in the state's northeast, an area that
had been blanketed by snow the day before.
   While many changes at the White House have followed droughts,
there have, of course, been dry years that didn't see a change in
party: Notably 1924, 1936 and 1956 which were below normal in rain

   Actress Mary Tyler Moore and TV producer Norman
Lear are among a wide range of celebrities, financiers and others
who gave large sums to the Democratic National Committee in the past
year, according to party records.
   Notables who made sizable contributions of less than $100,000
included: California stat legislator Tom Hayden, the husband of
actress Jane Fonda, $60,000; Miss Moore, $10,000; Miami Dolphins
owner Joseph Robbie, $50,000, and Lear, $25,000.
   The information was contained in DNC records filed in Austin,
Texas.
   The funds were given to the national committee's ``soft money''
account, which does not have to conform to limits imposed on the
candidates and the political parties by the Federal Election
Commission.
   The so-called soft money accounts are largely transferred by both
the Republican and Democratic National Committees to state parties.
   Democratic National Chairman Paul G. Kirk Jr. has said he would
disclose details of the committee's soft-money fund raising after
the election.
   Texas law, however, requires the parties to file either a list of
donors or a Federal Election Commission registration record when
they transfer money into the state from elsewhere.
   Since the soft money was not raised under federal limits, the
Democrats were required to submit a list of donors.
   Those listed as contributing $100,000 were:
   Andrew A. Athens, Chicago; Robert M. Bass, Fort Worth; Eli Broad
of Kaufman & Broad, Los Angeles; Ann Cox Chambers, Atlanta; Richard
D. Cohen, Boston; Marvin Davis, Los Angeles; Mark Dayton,
Minneapolis; Richard J. Dennis, president of Richard J. Dennis and
Co., Chicago;

<HEAD>Dukakis Battles to Keep Home State in His Column</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like a military general waging a campaign far
afield, Democrat Michael Dukakis has left a small garrison of
trusted aides back in Massachusetts to protect his home territory
from enemy attacks.
   The Dukakis effort to carry Massachusetts on Election Day has all
the elements of the presidential nominee's other statewide campaigns
except one: the candidate.
   ``Basically, we are running a traditional Democratic campaign in
this state, not unlike the campaigns he ran when he was running for
governor,'' said James McGovern, a spokesman for the Dukakis
campaign in Massachusetts.
   McGovern and other Dukakis aides have complained for weeks that
they are stuck between a rock and a hard place.
   If they wage a strong campaign here, they are vulnerable to
charges that the governor is so weak that he is afraid of losing his
home state. If they don't campaign hard, they are open to the rap
that they are taking the state for granted.
   ``We're in a situation where we're damned if we do and damned if
we don't,'' McGovern moaned.
   They have decided to err on the side of caution. Although the
national campaign strategists have raided the Boston headquarters
for field workers, the campaign has kept 12 paid staff working
full-time on delivering Massachusetts.
   ``We're running a campaign,'' McGovern insisted. ``By contrast, I
am unaware of any semblance of a field organization put together in
Massachusetts by the Bush camp. In fact, I am unaware of any
campaign other than what goes on in the Statehouse by a few
Republican legislators. I don't see evidence of any real outreach.''
   In fact, the Bush campaign has not written off Massachusetts.
   At the urging of Andrew Card, a former Republican legislator in
Massachusetts and a former Reagan White House aide, the Bush
national campaign has used Massachusetts adroitly to keep Dukakis on
the defensive.
   In a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans by about 4-1 and
where no Republican except Ronald Reagan has won a statewide
election since 1972, the Bush forces are overmatched on the ground
by the Dukakis team.
   But the Republicans have run a sharper campaign, offering almost
daily press conferences to undermine Dukakis' standing.
   The campaign also scored a major coup on Sept. 1 when the vice
president toured polluted Boston Harbor and attacked Dukakis' record
on the environment. The campaign was buoyed by a second Bush visit
for a showy endorsement from the Boston Police Patrolmen's
Association.
   According to published polls, the Bush effort has had some impact
in the state where Dukakis won a landslide re-election to a third
term just two years ago with nearly 70 percent of the vote.
   A series of surveys by KRC Research published in the Boston
Herald indicated that Dukakis enjoyed a 51-37 percent lead in July.
That edge disappeared by Sept. 1, when the poll showed the race a
dead heat at 42 percent.
   By mid-October, however, Dukakis had fought back to a 10-point
advantage in Massachusetts, leading Bush by 49-39 percent, only to
see Bush gain three points among undecideds and close to 49-42
percent as of Tuesday.
   James French, Dukakis' Massachusetts campaign coordinator, was
publicly more upbeat than the figures might suggest, saying, ``We're
confident of a big victory in Massachusetts.''
   To make sure of that, the Dukakis camp has mobilized its
customarily strong field organization, with 34 field offices in the
state, phone banks, sign-holding assignments in 123 cities and towns
and an extensive get-out-the-vote effort on Election Day.
   The campaign has also dropped more than one million pieces of
literature at homes statewide and plans to use 3,000 volunteers in
the Election Day operation.
   The campaign also is running short radio advertisements attacking
the Bush record on the environment, elderly and the economy, along
with some television ads in Springfield. For the most part, though,
they are relying on what campaign aides call ``free media'' _ that
is, news coverage.

   President Reagan asks Americans to ``continue
the change'' by voting Republican, and Democrats hit hard on
pocketbook issues and Dan Quayle's qualifications in the latest
barrage of political television ads.
   The national parties launched their final round Thursday, with
the Republicans showcasing Reagan and the Democrats appealing to the
average person's pocketbook in generic spots designed to drum up
support for candidates from president on down.
   Democrat Michael Dukakis' campaign unleashed its latest broadside
against GOP vice presidential nominee Quayle, a 30-second spot
featuring a well-known excerpt from his debate with Lloyd Bentsen,
the Democratic vice presidential debate.
   Onscreen appear the words, ``Before you vote, remember this,''
followed by the debate clip.
   Quayle: ``I have as much experience in the Congress as Jack
Kennedy did when he sought the presidency.''
   Bentsen: ``I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack
Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.''
   These words then appear: ``President Quayle?''
   Both Dukakis and Republican George Bush are running a varied mix
of upbeat and attack ads in key TV markets across the country. Their
themes but not their names appear in numerous generic TV and radio
spots produced by the Republican and Democratic national committees.
   The RNC entered the final phase of its $9 million media drive
Thursday with the TV message from Reagan. ``America is at peace, and
we are prosperous once more,'' Reagan says in the ad. ``On Tuesday,
I hope you will vote Republican _ up and down the ticket _ to
continue the change we began in 1981.''
   The GOP also has a 60-second radio ad in which Reagan recounts
his record and says ``our work is not yet done.'' He contends the
GOP has become ``the party of the working people, the family and the
neighborhood.''
   The DNC, contending it is the true party of the average working
person, released two pocketbook appeals designed to bolster
Democratic local, state and national candidates.
   One DNC ad, featuring festive images of the GOP convention and
headlines about nasty campaigning, says: ``What's hiding behind all
of this? The Republican tax plan ... If you make $200,000, you get a
tax gift of $30,000. ... If you're a typical middle class taxpayer _
like most of us _ the Republicans will give you a tax break, too.
Twenty bucks.''
   In the other DNC spot, an announcer bemoans foreign loans and
land purchases and the millions of U.S. jobs he says were shipped
overseas. ``Are the Republicans selling out America's future?'' he
asks.
   Both the RNC and DNC are running numerous radio commercials as
well. DNC officials won't discuss their advertising budget other
than to say this is the first time they've been able to raise enough
money for generic media.
   Each national party has produced six TV ads in all. But while
most of the DNC ads ran briefly and then vanished, the RNC is still
using spots it was airing as far back as July.
   Earlier DNC spots discussed the future of America's children,
attacked the GOP record on the federal deficit, and charged that GOP
prosperity hasn't trickled down to workers or the elderly.
   One of the RNC's long-running spots shows a little girl who an
announcer says has ``known virtually nothing but peace and economic
growth'' thanks to Republicans. Another flashes images of inflation,
gas lines and Jimmy Carter set to the tune ``I Remember You.''
   A third Republican spot, on the air since Oct. 10, shows pilot
Chuck Yeager in a defense plant alleging: ``When liberal Democrats
talk about slashing defense spending, they're not just talking about
America losing ground. They're talking about Americans losing jobs.''
   The Republicans also are using two Hispanic television ads, one
talking about Hispanic gains during the Reagan years and another
citing recently named Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos as ``a
friend in Washington.''
   The Justice Department, meanwhile, said it will investigate a
Spanish-language radio ad running in Hidalgo County in south Texas.
   Democrats complained GOP officials in the county are violating
federal voting rights laws by running ads that cite penalties for
non-citizens who vote and that twice remind listeners election
officials ``will be watching.''
   Republican officials defended the ads as proper and said they are
not an attempt at intimidation.
   And in Washington state, the Bush campaign has cut much of its
Seattle television advertising in the last days before the election,
station officials said. Dan Cumming of the state Bush campaign said
the decision was made at the national level and did not reflect any
decision to write off the state.
   A statewide poll conducted by KING-TV in Seattle and released
Thursday did show Dukakis with a 10-point advantage over George
Bush, 51-41, but the survey of likely voters had a five-point margin
of error.

   The students duel with the American
flags instead of waving them, and they cheer in the wrong place in a
speech, but George Bush is spending a lot of campaign time in high
schools.
   A desire to be the ``education president'' has little to do with
the visits. Bush campaign planners like the ready-made energetic
audiences that high schools, particularly those in Republican areas,
can provide.
   The school bands and always, always, the rows of spangled
cheerleaders on the stage with pompons, make for a colorful rally _
to be seen by the millions more who watch snippets of the events on
the local evening television news.
   Thus, Bush can appeal to blue-collar ``Reagan Democrats'' in
pivotal industrial Midwestern states without having to go into their
neighborhoods.
   ``We often go to schools which are familiar landscapes in the
communities,'' said Sheila Tate, Bush's press secretary. ``At this
time of the year, you like to have indoor events. And, often in a
community, a school is the biggest facility.''
   ``We also love the exuberance of the voters of tomorrow.''
   There lies one of the problems. When Bush tells rally
participants to go out and vote because he needs their help, more
often than not most of them aren't old enough. So Bush sometimes
adds an admonition to ``tell your parents.''
   And even though Republican campaign workers do their best to plan
every detail, the results aren't always what is expected when
audiences are so young.
   For instance, at a fieldhouse rally at Bloom Township High School
in this Chicago suburb on Thursday, muscular actor Arnold
Schwarzenegger got a far bigger cheer than did Bush.
   The vice president's reference to the ``L'' word mostly drew a
blank, and some students in the back of the hall ignored the speech
entirely and had sword fights with the American flags camaign
workers had distributed.
   Teenagers screech, scream, wave flags and constantly blow
airhorns handed out in the dozens by campaign staffers.
   They cheer sometimes indiscriminately, giving equally loud cheers
to mention of the death penalty or to a mention by Bush that a
Democratic Congress will spend more tax dollars.
   Bush apologized to students at one late-afternoon rally at
Lansing Catholic Central in Michigan this week for their being
``made to stay after school'' by their principal. ``But this is one
great rally.''
   Bush has been hitting a high school or two a day for the past few
weeks.
   High schools are picked for Bush's standard rally speech. More
serious speeches are usually delivered to college audiencies or to
meetings of national organizations.
   But with the campaign winding down, most of Bush's remaining
appearances will be at rallies _ and that more often than not means
more high schools.
   Bush isn't the only presidential candidate to use high school
rallies as a frequent forum for campaign appearances. President
Reagan did it and so does Democrat Michael Dukakis.
   ``This is not a campaign about (prison) furloughs and flag
factories,'' Dukakis said recently at a high school in another
Chicago suburb. ``This is a campaign about the future of America.
And especially about young people.''
   National public opinion polls show there is an age gap, usually
in the double digits _ with Bush generally enjoying more support
among the youngest voters than Dukakis.

   Republican vice presidential candidate
Dan Quayle says Michael Dukakis' tough talk on drugs ``rings
hollow'' because the attorney general of Massachusetts has
complained of losing ground against narcotics traffickers.
   Seeking to counteract Dukakis' attacks on Vice President George
Bush's record in the Reagan administration anti-drug abuse fight,
Quayle used an Oklahoma State University speech to label the
Massachusetts governor soft on crime.
   Quayle, standing before a crowd of more than 4,000 college
students and citizens of this Oklahoma college town, sent a
long-distance challenge to Dukakis to explain a statement by the
Massachusetts attorney general, James Shannon, a Democrat.
   ``We're losing the war on drugs in the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts,'' Quayle quoted Shannon as saying. An aide to the
senator said that Shannon's statement had appeared in June 10
editions of The New York Times.
   ``With five days to go before the election, Mr. Dukakis is coming
out with a lot of tough talk about a war on drugs,'' Quayle said.
``But as with so many other areas of tough talk, the governor's
position on drugs rings hollow.''
   ``If Mr. Dukakis can't fight drugs effectively in his own
backyard, how can he make claims to do so for America?'' he asked.
   Late Thursday, Shannon issued a statement through the Dukakis
campaign, saying: ``The reason we have a drug problem in
Massachusetts and 49 other states is because George Bush blew the
one job Ronald Reagan gave him, and that was to spearhead the
administration's war on drugs.
   ``While Governor Dukakis led the nation in bringing early drug
education into the schools and spending more money on drug
enforcement, George Bush was asleep at the wheel.''
   Quayle said that Dukakis' opposition to the death penalty and
tough mandatory sentences for narcotics traffickers shows the
governor is unequipped to succeed in the battle against drug
trafficking and drug use.
   Quayle gave his speech to an enthusiastic crowd on the OSU
campus, although there were Dukakis-Bentsen signs and some hecklers
in the audience. As a blue balloon prematurely escaped its net and
sailed over Quayle's head, the senator quipped, ``Good night, Mike.''
   The Indiana senator was traveling to Louisiana and Alabama today
before heading back to Washington for a one-night stay.
   Quayle will campaign in Maryland and West Virginia on Saturday,
but no schedule has been announced for Sunday. He will travel to
Indianapolis on Monday, cast his vote and return to Washington for
Tuesday night's election returns.
   Quayle's speech here came at the end of a rocky campaign day in
which his Boeing 727 jet was grounded on an airport runway in
Owensboro, Ky., for several hours and he had to scrub two
appearances in the Greenville-Spartanburg, S.C., area. Instead,
Quayle flew to the Greenville airport and met with reporters from
the area, shook a few hands in a small crowd and got back on the
plane for the trip to Oklahoma.
   Meeting with reporters from various news organizations in
Oklahoma, Quayle signaled what responsibilities he might have in a
Bush administration.
   Although he said he thought it was ``bad luck'' to talk about
such a scenario before Election Day, Quayle did say that Bush had
talked to him about heading a space council.
   He also noted previous talk of Quayle heading the anti-drug abuse
effort, although the senator also said that legislation passed by
Congress in its waning days would require that a drug czar be a
Cabinet officer.
   Quayle also said that his experience on the congressional foreign
relations panels would make him a valuable member of the National
Security Council and said he considered himself particularly well
equipped to provide advice on education and job-training programs.

<TEXT>
   The chairman of Latvians for Bush has resigned
his post following charges that he belonged to a World War II group
with Nazi ties, the Bush campaign said.
   Akselis Mangulis, who was also a volunteer with the vice
president's Coalition of American Nationalities, has ``suspended his
membership'' in the coalition, said Alixe Glen, a spokeswoman
traveling with the Republican presidential nominee.
   Mangulis is the eighth person connected with Bush's ethnic
council to step down following reports of connections to Nazi or
anti-Semitic groups.
   Editors at The Philadelphia Inquirer said Thursday night that
they were planning a story for Friday's editions on Mangulis'
membership in the Latvian Legion, a group which had connections to
the German SS, the quasi-military unit of the Nazi Party.
   Bush campaign spokesmen in Washington and on the campaign trail
told reporters Thursday evening of Mangulis' ``suspension'' and his
resignation of the Latvians for Bush post.
   Mark Goodin, a Bush spokesman, said the Mangulis' family
confirmed the association with the Latvian Legion, but said he was
conscripted in that group against his will.
   ``The charges lodged against Mangulis deserve to be clarified by
him away from the Bush-Quayle campaign,'' said Goodin. ``As of this
time, his volunteer membership in the Coalition of American
Nationalities is suspended as he pursues that right.''
   A woman who answered the phone at the Mangulis residence in
Andover, Mass., denied that he had been asked to resign from
Latvians for Bush or had been a member of a group sympathetic to the
Nazis.
   ``He was not resigning and he will run until Mr. Bush is
elected,'' said the woman who identified herself as Mrs. Mangulis
but refused to give her first name. ``Bush campaign did not ask him
to resign. He did not resign because he did not have reason to
resign.
   ``He is not in any group in World War II,'' said the woman, who
spoke with a heavy accent. ``He was a young man and he is not a Nazi
and he is not anti-Semitic. I'm telling you honest and truthful. All
are lies, never did he resign, never was it no shame.''
   She said the family is seeking legal assistance and ``I am going
to take action for this harassment.''
   She said her husband was not home.

   A model has filed a $480,000 lawsuit against
former New York Jets football star Mark Gastineau, claiming he broke
promises and lied to her during their three-year relationship.
   Jodee Dominici of Phoenix claims in the suit filed Thursday in
Maricopa County Superior Court that Gastineau, whom she met in
February 1985, talked her into quitting her modeling job to help
manage his business and personal affairs.
   Ms. Dominici, who appeared on the television show ``Star Search''
in October 1985, says Gastineau told her he was single when he
actually was married and failed to tell her about his marital status
until they had dated about a month. The suit says Ms. Dominici was
18 years old at the time.
   It also claims Gastineau took $12,000 she received in personal
injury settlements and never returned it to her.
   Gastineau and Ms. Dominici ended their relationship in January
1988 when Gastineau began seeing actress Brigitte Nielsen. Gastineau
resigned from the Jets last month after Ms. Nielsen said she had
cancer of the uterus.
   A biopsy last week showed Ms. Nielsen did not have cancer but had
dysplasia, a cellular irregularity, that was treated with
cryosurgery.
   Gastineau, who reportedly has been living in his boyhood home in
eastern Arizona, did not immediately return phone calls from The
Associated Press.

his company's board of directors here to visit the new Diamond-Star
Motors Corp. auto assembly plant, but the trip wasn't all business.
   Iacocca took time from the monthly board meeting Wednesday to
take a spin in a couple of new Plymouth Lasers around Diamond-Star's
test track.
   ``He was very excited,'' said G. Glenn Gardner, chairman of
Diamond-Star, a joint venture between Chrysler and Mitsubishi Motors
Corp. of Japan. ``He took out a couple different cars and really
enjoyed it.''
   Chrysler Motors Chairman Gerald Greenwald and some of the 21
other board members also had some fun test-driving new Lasers, said
Robin Skiles, a Diamond-Star spokeswoman.
   ``They were really whipping around the test track,'' she said.
``They are like new toys to them.''
   Iacocca is scheduled to drive the first car off the assembly line
at the plant's formal opening ceremony next week. The plant also
produces the Mitsubishi Eclipse.

   Veteran actor Sir Alec Guinness has returned to the
London stage for the first time in a decade.
   Guinness, 74, appeared in Thursday night's opening of ``A Walk in
the Woods,'' by American writer Lee Blessing, playing a Soviet arms
negotiator coming to terms with nuclear weapons. The play closed on
Broadway in New York earlier this year.
   Most of Guinness' recent work has been in films and television.
   He last appeared in a London theater in Alan Bennett's ``The Old
Country'' in 1977-78.
   In 1984, he was Shylock in William Shakespeare's ``The Merchant

   Singer-songwriter Van Stephenson claims
in a lawsuit that Penthouse Forum magazine made him look like a
sexual deviant by using one of his album covers to illustrate an
article about transvestites.
   Stephenson, who lives nearby in Williamson County, contends in
the U.S. District Court suit filed this week that the magazine
invaded his privacy and defamed his character.
   The suit seeks $500,000 in damages. Among those named as
defendants are Forum International Ltd., the magazine's publisher;
Bob Guccione, the magazine's chief executive officer; and MCA
Records, which released Stephenson's album.
   Penthouse publicist Leslie Jay said she had not seen the lawsuit
and could not comment. MCA officials did not return telephone calls
seeking comment.
   The photo shows Stephenson's face with an agonized expression
superimposed on a woman's back. It was the cover for his 1984 album
``Righteous Anger.''
   Stephenson's songs include ``Your Kisses Will,'' recorded by
Crystal Gayle, and ``China Girl,'' recorded by John Cougar
Mellencamp.

   Jeremy Thomas, the British producer of the
Oscar-winning movie ``The Last Emperor,'' says he was forced to seek
investment abroad for his new films after investors from his own
country refused to fund him again.
   ``It's a great shame that British banks would not back us this
time,'' said the 39-year-old producer. ``A lot of money for `The
Last Emperor' came from British institutions and they all got their
money back.''
   He told reporters Thursday he raised $120 million in Japan and
Europe for his next six movies, a sum he claimed was a record for an
independent British producer.
   The first movie, ``Everybody Wins,'' will be based on a
screenplay by American playwright Arthur Miller, whose last film
script was for the 1961 classic ``The Misfits,'' starring Marilyn
Monroe and Clark Gable.
   ``Everybody Wins,'' which is to be shot in Connecticut and North
Carolina in January, will be directed by Briton Karel Reisz and
feature American stars Nick Nolte and Debra Winger, said Thomas.
   Thomas said the other films he will be making as part of his

   Soviet spy satellite photographs can
now be purchased from a Munich company.
   ``We use Soviet, U.S., and French satellite photographs for
research. You can get them from us, but we're not officially
marketing them,'' Rupert Haydn, managing director of the Company for
Applied Remote Sensing (GAF), said Thursday.
   Haydn said GAF works closely with the Moscow-based Soyuzkarta
company, from which the satellite photographs are obtained.
   The GAF staff uses modern digital processing to develop data from
satellite photographs for environmental and climate surveillance,
forestry, agriculture and other areas of research, Haydn said.
   The company recently obtained a photograph of a 37-square-mile
area surrounding Munich from Soyuzkarta that had been taken from
about 125 miles high by a Soviet Kosmos satellite.
   It shows highways, streets, buildings and objects as small as 16
feet in size.
   ``They are of good quality,'' Haydn said. He said the photographs
``were several years old, and no doubt at one time they could have
been used for military reconnaissance.''
   Haydn said the cost of a Soviet satellite photograph is about
$980, or nearly equal to the $1,000 charged for a U.S. version.

   George Bush holds a 21-point lead over
Michael Dukakis in a new poll of North Dakota voters.
   The telephone survey of 506 respondents earlier this week gave
Bush 53.7 percent compared with 325 percent for Dukakis and 14
percent undecided. The results were similar to one taken two weeks
ago.
   The poll released Thursday was commissioned by Bismarck-based
Meyer Broadcasting Co. and KTHI-TV of Fargo. It was conducted by the
University of North Dakota's Bureau of Governmental Affairs and had
a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

<HEAD>U.S. Middle East Expert Tried To Free Hostages, ``Nightline''
Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. expert on the Middle East with ties to
George Bush's presidential campaign met with Syrian officials in
August in an attempt to free the U.S. hostages in Lebanon, ABC-TV's
``Nightline'' reported Wednesday.
   After the U.S. government learned of the meeting, Secretary of
State George Shultz told Syria that the expert, Paul Jureidini, in
no way represented the government, the program reported. Shultz also
told Jureidini to end any such contacts.
   A spokesman for Vice President Bush, Mark Goodin, denied that
Jureidini's meeting was in any way sanctioned by the campaign. As
late as July, Jureidini served as an unpaid consultant on the Middle
East to the campaign, ``Nightline'' said.
   Jureidini, who has been a frequent Pentagon consultant and has
top-level U.S. security clearance, said on the program that he told
his Syrian hosts during the meeting in Damascus that he was acting
on his own. Joining Jureidini at the meeting was his partner, Ronald
McLaurin.
   ``Nightline,'' quoting Syrian sources, reported that during the
Aug. 16 meeting, Jureidini and his hosts discussed options for
securing the release of the nine American hostages and what the
impact of any such release would be on the U.S. presidential
election.
   ``Nightline'' also reported that the release last month of
hostage Mithileshwar Singh, an Indian professor who is a legal
resident of the United States, followed third-party contacts between
the United States and Iran.
   The program said the intermediary was West German Foreign
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher. Through this channel, Shultz told
Iran that the U.S. hostages must be freed if there is to be real
progress in improving U.S.-Iranian relations.
   Following this contact, substantial pressure was exerted on the
Hezbollah, the radical group in Lebanon believed to be holding the
hostages, ``Nightline'' reported. That pressure led to Singh's
release, it said.
   Following his release, the U.S. government sent word to Iran via
the Japanese government that all the U.S. hostages must be released,
and that there would be no deal and no negotiations, ``Nightline''
reported.
   Iranian officials said that response was an insult; that Iran was
not trying to make a deal, only start a process that would lead to
the release of the other hostages, the program reported.
   From the Iranian perpective, the Singh release was a gesture that
could have led to more releases, ``Nightline'' said. But the U.S.
response, in the Iranian view, resulted in the door slamming shut,
it reported.
   U.S. officials told the program that the response was consistent
with U.S. policy on the hostages.
   ``Nightline'' reported that the West German contact was just one
of many such contacts regarding the hostages between Iranian
officials and people who claimed to represent either the U.S.
government or the presidential campaigns of Bush or Michael Dukakis.
   Spokesmen for both campaigns denied they had authorized any such
contacts.
   The number of such contacts was so great that in October, the
Iranian government complained in an official message to the U.S.
government, ``Nightline'' reported. Iran refused to provide the
names of those it claims made such contacts, the show reported.
   In early October, Shultz announced that such contacts were
unauthorized and that those making them should ``butt out'' and let
the State Department handle the hostage situation.

   Democratic vice presidential candidate
Lloyd Bentsen combined a little Capitol Hill politics with his
national campaign by endorsing Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., to
become the next Senate Democratic leader.
   Campaigning in Louisiana, one of the few Southern states where
polls show the Democrats are within a few points of the Republicans,
Bentsen spoke at a rally Thursday night in favor of Johnston.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, this fellow is going to be the new
majority leader of the United States Senate,'' said Bentsen.
``That's a public pledge and commitment right there.''
   It was the first time the Texas senator has taken a public stand
on the race to replace Robert C. Byrd, who is retiring as majority
leader this year.
   Johnston and Sens. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, and George Mitchell,
D-Me., are competing for the powerful post. The position will remain
with the Democrats if they retain a majority in the chamber.
   Asked about Bentsen's statement afterward, Johnston said his
colleague had made his preference known privately but never before
in public. Asked how he was doing in the race, Johnston held up his
hand to show his thumb and forefinger held a little bit apart.
   Bentsen planned to stop in Houston today before heading to
California for a quick campaign swing.
   Bentsen's stand on the Senate leadership issue marked an abrupt
change from the down-home East Texas politics that occupied most of
his day on Thursday.
   Bentsen toured by bus more than 200 miles through the rural
communities near the Louisiana and Arkansas borders. The goal was to
win Reagan Democrats to the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket.
   In speeches in Longview, Paris and Sulphur Springs, Bentsen
highlighted the Democratic campaign's theme that he and presidential
nominee Michael Dukakis were on the side of the middle class and
were willing to stand up for American workers in international trade
negotiations.
   Talking to reporters on his bus, Bentsen said he still thought
the Democrats could eke out a victory next Tuesday. But he also
speculated on the kind of relationship George Bush might have with
Congress if elected president, in light of the Republicans' negative
campaigning.
   ``I don't see how... a president has any kind of mandate if he
wins by the amount of negative advertising,'' he said.
   A new president usually has a ``honeymoon'' with Congress, but in
Bush's case ``it would be an awfully short one, if you had that,''
he said.
   Bentsen drew crowds at his events with the help of actor Rob Lowe
and singer Gary Morris, who accompanied him for the trip. Morris, a
Texan who has also campaigned with Dukakis, introduced Bentsen after
warming up the crowds with a few songs.

   Struck down by bad luck and last year's stock
market crash, a once-rising star among entrepreneurs is trying
desperately to save his business with a 12-day-old hunger strike in
an illegally parked van opposite the New York Stock Exchange.
   ``I've come to the seat of capitalism, the New York Stock
Exchange, to be heard,'' Jan Stuart said Thursday.
   Stuart said he has not eaten since he left his Cliffside Park,
N.J., apartment on Oct. 24 to live in a van on Wall Street, just
feet away from where George Washington was sworn in as the first
president of the United States.
   The 34-year-old owner of Jan Stuart Skin Care Co., who was once
featured on the cover of Entrepreneur Magazine, was viewed
skeptically at first as police ticketed the van for each of the
first four days and passers-by told him he was crazy.
   But as the days passed _ and Stuart's weight dropped from 190
pounds to 175 _ police left him alone and onlookers started writing
encouraging notes on his van, which features posters that read:
``Wake Up America'' and ``Help Me Save My Company.''
   Dozens of people have already signed a petition, attached to his
van, that Stuart hopes to present to the stock exchange to show that
there is concern for the small business owner in America.
   ``I have to do something drastic to keep my business going. I'm
desperately in need of funding,'' Stuart said.
   ``Small business people need help. We are the future of this
country. Big business has put me down. In the small business world,
anything can cause destruction,'' he added.
   Eight years ago, Stuart invested $2,000 in a line of
natural-ingredient men's shaving and skin care products, and turned
it into a business that had annual sales in the millions.
   As his product began showing up on the shelves of Bloomingdale's,
A&S, Lord & Taylor, Macy's and other major department stores, he
attracted national media attention.
   He built a staff of 60 workers and expanded his line to 30 skin
care products for men sold in 2,000 department stores in the United
States, Canada, England, Australia, Puerto Rico and the Caribbean.
The Entrepreneur article called him the ``Father of the Men's Skin
Care Industry.''
   But Stuart's luck turned when he attempted to raise $9.2 million
so the company could continue to grow. He said a major underwriter
went out of business and a second company that offered necessary
financing went down in the stock market crash last year.
   Some companies showed interest in teaming up with him but
``corporate constipation'' got in the way, he said, meaning he would
have to wait until lengthy feasibility studies were completed.
   ``My dream has been to build a business, become a viable part of
the American economy,'' Stuart said.
   Now, Stuart said he is left with a $2 million debt and just
enough of his products to supply mail-order clients.
   In a full-page advertisement in The New York Times on Aug. 3,
Stuart pleaded with the public to ``Please Help Me Save My
Company!'' He said the ad resulted in hundreds of letters and phone
calls but no financing.
   Now, he sits in the van he has rented for $600 a week, outfitted
with a bed and toilet, and watches as people sign their name and
offer opinions on his plight.
   ``Please eat,'' wrote Lorne Williams.
   ``Wish you all you are wishing for comes true, love you, mom,''
reads another note.
   Michael J. Basel, who works on the floor of the stock exchange,
tapped on his window and shouted him luck.
   ``He's trying to say, `I've got an idea. I want you to take me to
the moon,''' Basel said.
   ``Guys like him aren't going to make it right now,'' Basel said,
explaining that Wall Street is not funding risky ventures until it
is clear which way the economy is headed after Election Day.
   Doug Colitz, a 23-year-old Coast Guard worker in New York, said
Stuart ``must be out of his mind.''
   ``There's a lot less fortunate people in the world than him.
Business comes and goes every day in New York. It's survival of the
fittest. He's a loser, but, heh, he's got some spunk.''

<TEXT>
   The FBI agent who began a successful
class-action discrimination lawsuit against the bureau says he and
other Hispanic agents have since been harassed, and they are asking
a judge to bar such retaliation.
   A 32-page document filed Thursday in U.S. District Judge Lucius
Bunton's court contains affidavits from three Hispanic agents who
contend they have been singled out and treated unfairly since Bunton
ruled Sept. 30 that the FBI discriminates against Hispanics in
promotions and job conditions.
   FBI spokesman Gregory Jones in Washington denied the allegations,
saying ``any intimidation or retaliation would be illegal and
intolerable, and would result in an FBI inquiry.''
   Bernardo ``Matt'' Perez, who initiated the class-action lawsuit
in January 1987, contended in his affidavit that many of his duties
as No. 2 man in the El Paso office have been taken away, and that
his boss has intimidated another agent for talking to reporters
about the case.
   An agent in Miami, Fernando Mata, said in his affidavit that he
needs psychiatric care for a traumatic stint as an undercover
foreign counterintelligence agent, but that the bureau has refused
to grant security clearance to a psychiatrist outside the FBI.
   Mata, who received the FBI's highest award in 1983 for his
overseas work, said he prefers to see a psychiatrist who doesn't
work for the bureau.
   James Garay, an Albuquerque agent, contended in his affidavit
that his gun and car were stripped from him under the pretext of a
medical condition. He said the bureau claimed he was too badly
injured in an on-the-job car accident.
   The three agents who submitted the affidavits testified in the
two-week, non-jury trial before Bunton in August.
   The 311 Latino agents who joined the suit successfully argued
that the FBI assigned them less desirable jobs, promoted them too
slowly and didn't give them the recognition they deserved for their
successes.
   Bunton will rule on damages in future hearings. He implied in his
Sept. 30 decision that monetary damages might be small or
non-existent, and that he might order the FBI to change the way it
operates.
   In his affidavit, Perez contended that since the verdict was
announced, ``I have been purposely divorced from many of the
administrative operations of the office, and from my day-to-day
management responsibilities.''
   Perez' boss, agent-in-charge Richard Schwein, said the allegation
is ``not true.''
   ``He carries out the day-to-day operations in this office, and
everyone in this office reports to him except me,'' Schwein said
Thursday.
   Schwein said he saw a TV interview of one Hispanic agent in El
Paso on the night of the decision, and that he talked to the man
about it later.
   ``I said, `Hey, pal, you didn't say you were speaking as a
citizen and not as a special agent of the FBI,''' Schwein said.
   He added that he dropped the matter when the agent explained that
such a comment had been edited out.
   Schwein said he feels more hurt than angry about Perez'
allegations.
   ``I resent having my integrity challenged,'' he said. ``I don't
like falsehoods and I consider these falsehoods. I've had no one
walk in the door and say, `Boss, you're retaliating against me.'
This (affidavit) was a stunning shock to me.''

   Kitty Dukakis says she feels healthier but
plans to use common sense to protect her health as she resumes
campaigning for her husband, Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis.
   Before leaving her hospital room Thursday, Mrs. Dukakis received
a telephone call from her husband and wished him a happy 55th
birthday. They had planned to campaign together in Waterbury, Conn.,
Thursday before she was hospitalized Monday night with a temperature
of 102 degrees.
   Mrs. Dukakis was treated for a bacterial and viral infection at
the University of Minnesota Hospital.
   ``I feel much better,'' Mrs. Dukakis said as she left the
hospital. ``I'm looking forward to resuming campaigning ... I'm
going to do what I can, but I'm going to use common sense as well.''
   Her press secretary, Paul Costello, said Mrs. Dukakis meet her
husband in Chicago late today and that she would keep a limited
schedule Saturday, with appearances tentatively scheduled in Texas
and Colorado.
   If possible, Mrs. Dukakis will resume a full schedule with her
husband on the West Coast Sunday and Monday for the final two days
of the campaign, Costello said.

   A 10-year-old boy who may have feared
being reported for truancy shot a school bus driver in the head,
critically wounding her, police said.
   Russell Jean Hampton, 40, was shot in the base of the skull
Thursday with a small-caliber handgun, police said. She remained in
critical condition early today at St. Mary's Hospital here.
   The boy was taken into custody at his grandparents' house, near
the site of the shooting, after his grandmother called police. He
could go before a state district judge today and face charges,
authorities said.
   ``I talked to one of the assistant superintendents who is
familiar with the boy, and he said everyone was quite surprised,''
said Joe M. Pitts, superintendent of the Port Arthur schools. ``He
was an all-around student and did a good job participating in
school.''
   The youth was seen running from the bus shortly before Ms.
Hampton was found, police said. Another bus driver found her slumped
over the steering wheel and called an ambulance.
   The shooting occurred after Ms. Hampton had dropped off students
at Dick Dowling Elementary School and was returning to the
district's bus storage barn, police said.
   ``Apparently this boy had missed the bus earlier in the day and
she had seen him riding his bicycle along the road on her way
back,'' said police Lt. J.W. Fontenot. ``We don't know whether he
was riding his bike to school or playing hooky.''
   Police speculated that Ms. Hampton had told the boy to get on the
bus, with the intention of returning him to school and possibly
reporting him for truancy.
   Fontenot said the boy also may have been afraid school officials
would discover the weapon. A .22-caliber handgun and the boy's
bicycle were recovered from the bus, Fontenot said.
   The shooting victim's father, Russell DeJohn of Port Arthur, said
he was shocked by the incident.
   ``She was a housewife and a mother and she never bothered
anybody,'' DeJohn said.

   Doctors are letting alcoholics use hospitals as
``revolving doors'' by ignoring their drinking problems, even though
experience shows that alcoholism can be effectively treated,
researchers reported today.
   At a Connecticut hospital's emergency room, not a single patient
was referred for alcohol evaluation or assistance out of 47 who were
found to have at least double the legal blood-alcohol limit, the
researchers said.
   The subjects were among 346 motor-vehicle accident victims whose
cases were reviewed at the unidentified hospital's trauma center,
said the researchers, led by Dr. Grace Chang of Yale University
School of Medicine in New Haven.
   Only about one-fourth of the 346 patients were even tested for
alcohol, with 53 of them testing positive, the researchers reported
in today's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   Forty-seven had levels of at least 200 milligrams of alcohol per
deciliter of blood _ double the legal limit for drivers in
Connecticut, the researchers said. Levels went as high as 550
milligrams per deciliter, they said.
   Blood-alcohol levels of 200 milligrams per deciliter ``are
unusual in the course of ordinary social drinking'' and are
considered an indication that a drinker has ``an alcohol problem,
however infrequent his inebriation,'' the researchers said.
   While unable to generalize about all physicians, the researchers
said this study and others indicate that recognition of alcohol
problems in hospital emergency departments ``is limited, as is
referral for treatment.''
   ``Despite evidence that alcoholism treatment success rates can be
as good as or better than those for many medical problems,
alcoholics are permitted to use medical centers as revolving doors,
with the witting and unwitting complicity of the institutions,'' the
researchers said.
   Studies show that when doctors advise patients that their alcohol
consumption is dangerous, ``there is a high probability that the
patient will cut back on use of the drug,'' said an accompanying
editorial in the Journal.
   ``Studies of patients treated for alcoholism show that brief
relapse, peaking around six months after treatment, is common, but
long-term improvement usually is the ultimate outcome,'' added the
editorial by Dr. Julian R. Waller of the the University of Vermont
College of Medicine in Burlington.
   A separate study in today's Journal found that people who usually
consumed five to eight drinks per occasion were almost twice as
likely to die of an injury as non-drinkers or those who consumed one
or two.
   That study also found that people who consumed nine or more
drinks per occasion had more than triple the risk of the
low-consumption groups.
   ``The important finding in this study is that what people tell us
about alcohol use related strongly to their future risk of dying
from an injury,'' said Dr. Robert F. Anda, co-author of the study
and a researcher at the national Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta.
   ``We hope that this finding will help physicians become more
involved in asking patients about their alcohol use,'' Anda added in
a telephone interview Thursday.
   Motor vehicle accidents accounted for about one-fourth of the
deaths among the study's subjects, 13,251 adults who answered
questions about their drinking habits and then were tracked for nine
years.
   Eighty-one subjects suffered fatal injuries _ 24 in motor vehicle
accidents, 20 in suicides, nine in homicides, six in falls, four in
fires, three each in drownings and poisonings, and the others in
miscellaneous ways, the researchers found.

   A shootout between rival labor factions inside
a luxury hotel sent guests fleeing to their rooms and left two
people dead and 21 wounded, authorities said.
   Identities of those killed Thursday night at the Hotel Presidente
Chapultepec were not immediately available. But Marta Ramirez, hotel
shift supervisor, said today that all guests and employees were safe
and accounted for.
   Hotel spokesman Federico Gonzalez said factions of the Mexican
Workers Federation and the Revolutionary Confederation of Workers
and Campesinos clashed inside the lobby. The brawlers surged into
the bar, attacking a group of Revolutionary Confederation-affiliated
musicians.
   The pro-government Workers Federation lost a bid to win the
musicians' contract to the Revolutionary Confederation in an
arbitration ruling earlier Thursday, the Excelsior news service
reported.
   The shootout was the second involving the Federation this week.
On Monday, a fight between Federation activists and the Acapulco
hotel workers union left two people dead, 18 injured and Acapulco's
union headquarters in flames.
   Gonzalez said he did not know who began shooting first. Employees
of the popular hotel near Chapultepec Park quickly ushered guests to
their rooms after the shooting broke out.
   Humberto Pena, a Red Cross spokesman, confirmed two died from
gunshot wounds.
   The Red Cross said 21 people suffered wounds from the gunfire or
beatings with clubs. Among the wounded was a policeman shot in the
leg, Red Cross spokesman Rafael Aguila said.
   Receptionist Edgar Bringas said the hotel had received anonymous
telephone calls warning of trouble at the hotel.
   It took police an hour to break up the melee, Bringas said.
   Roberto Garcia Sanchez, a duty officer at 9th precinct police
headquarters, said 167 people were arrested.
   Paul Gregory, a design consultant, and Lou Lindauer, both of New
York, were inside the bar when the melee began.
   ``There was a lot of screaming. We heard gunshots. We looked up
and the lobby was filled with white smoke,'' Gregory said.
   Said Lindauer: ``I don't take this as a normal thing. I was more
fascinated than anything.''
   In the aftermath, hotel employees mopped up shards of glass and
took down barricades of furniture set up when the shooting began.
Papers were strewn throughout the lobby. The lobby offices of the
Avis car rental agency and Mexicana Airlines also were destroyed.
   Gloria Rodriguez, a receptionist, said the 37-story hotel was
about half-booked.
   ``There are desks, smashed furniture and paper all over the
place,'' she said. ``It's a real mess.''

   Radicals firebombed a U.S. Army
facility and a ruling party office and seized a government building
today, demanding the arrest of a former president and withdrawal of
American troops.
   The incidents came a day after thousands of students took part in
nationwide rallies against former President Chun Doo-hwan in one of
the worst street protests in South Korea in recent months.
   Chun has been under public fire for alleged misuse of power,
corruption and violation of human rights during his seven-year
tenure that ended in February. Chun, a former general, seized power
with military backing in 1980.
   U.S. authorities said a dozen youths today threw six firebombs
into the compound of a U.S. Army engineering installation and fled,
shattering windows but causing no injuries.
   Radicals have demanded the withdrawal of 42,000 U.S. troops in
South Korea as part of their anti-U.S. campaign.
   About 20 students hurled firebombs at an office of the governing
Democratic Justice Party in the western port of Inchon, shattering
windows, police said. No injuries or arrests were reported.
   In another attack, on the Office of National Tax Administration
in downtown Seoul, five students demanding Chun's arrest seized a
third-floor office for a half-hour before being overpowered by
police.
   Two of the students jumped onto mattresses placed by police on
the ground outside the building. Police said the two were slightly
injured.
   Up to 380 people, mostly police, were injured and about 100
protesters are under questioning after more than 29,000 people took
part in anti-Chun rallies across the country Thursday, newspapers
reported today.
   About 9,200 rounds of tear gas were used against 18,700 firebombs
hurled by students, police said, adding that students attacked six
government party offices, eight police substations and two
government buildings.
   Student leaders said today they would continue an anti-government
campaign to press for Chun's arrest and punishment for alleged
corruption and human rights abuses.
   Students also vowed to join another march Saturday to Chun's
house, called by dissident groups.
   Chun has been under parliamentary investigation on various
charges, including his alleged role in putting down a 1980 civil
uprising in the southern city of Kwangu. About 200 people died in
the military suppression of the uprising.
   Radicals are also demanding the overthrow of President Roh
Tae-woo and claim the government is a front for military rule. Roh,
who has introduced broad democratic reforms, took over from Chun
after winning presidential elections in December.
   The radicals have little or no public support, but they are a
powerful presence on college campuses and frequently stage violent
anti-government protests.

<HEAD>Suit Demands Adjustment To Avoid Undercount In 1990 Census</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN SHANAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York, Los Angeles and other major cities have
sued the federal government claiming that undercounting in the 1990
census could cost them billions of dollars and deprive minorities of
their political clout.
   ``This is one of the most important civil rights issues in the
country today,'' said Peter Zimroth, New York City's chief attorney.
``To the extent minorities, black and Hispanics in the inner cities
are undercounted, their vote is diluted.''
   The cities contend in the suit, filed Thursday, that the Census
Bureau was prepared to make adjustments to compensate for
undercounting, particularly of minority groups, but that it was
overruled last year by the Commerce Department, its parent body.
   Congressional seats and federal grants are allocated on the basis
of population. If an area is undercounted, it may have fewer
representatives in the House and lose millions of dollars from
Washington.
   The census as now structured misses many members of minority
groups and illegal aliens, the suit contends, because many of them
do not respond to the mailed census forms.
   The suit says they could be counted if census takers visited
homes in selected areas and projected the results.
   Also joining in the lawsuit were Chicago and Dade County, Fla.,
which includes Miami; as well as the states of California and New
York; the U.S. Conference of Mayors; the National League of Cities;
the League of United Latin American Citizens; and the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   The suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn with the
Department of Commerce, the Census Bureau and President Reagan among
the defendants.
   The Census Bureau has acknowledged it undercounts the population,
although the best estimates suggest that only about 1 percent of the
total was missed in the last 1980 census. But the bureau estimates
the undercounting of blacks is 5 or 6 percentage points higher,
since it is hard to reach the inner-city neighborhoods where many
share addresses and distrust the government.
   The Commerce Department referred all calls to the Justice
Department. Amy Brown, a spokeswoman, said the department had not
yet received the complaint and therefore could not comment.
   In Los Angeles, according to City Attorney James K. Hahn, the
population was undercounted by 4.6 percent in 1980. Blacks living in
Los Angeles were undercounted by 9.1 percent, Hispanics by 9.8
percent and Asians by 7.3 percent.
   ``What makes this problem of undercounting particularly
troublesome _ and even tragic _ is that the people most affected are
the ones in the most dire need of adequate representation and
help,'' Hahn said.
   Zimroth, New York's corporation counsel, said the city was
undercounted by about 500,000 people in 1980 and that he expects the
1990 census to be even less accurate.
   New York state lost five of its 39 representatives as a result of
the 1980 census and is expected to lose three more because of the
1990 count, according to Election Data Services Inc.
   In Chicago, officials said the undercount costs the city more
than $10 million a year in federal aid for social programs, a seat
in the state House of Representatives, half a seat in the state
Senate, and one-fourth of a congressional seat.
   New York state Attorney General Robert Abrams said an inaccurate
census violates the principle of one man, one vote.
   It would mean that ``states, cities and, in particular, minority
communities will be shortchanged on funds for housing, education,
health, nutrition, community development, drug enforcement and other
vital services,'' he said.
   Zimroth said the city based much of its case on an affidavit by
Barbara Bailar, the Census Bureau's associate director for
statistical standards, who resigned after 29 years to protest the
Department of Commerce's decision not to go ahead with plans for an
undercount correction.
   Ms. Bailar was the federal government's chief witness against the
city in an unsuccessful similar suit New York brought to correct the
1980 census. She said then that the technology to make an accurate
count was not available, but later concluded it could be done.
   No date has been set for a hearing in the case.

   Two black men were shot to death by
police during unrest in a Natal Province township, officials said
today.
   The shootings took place in separate incidents during the night
at Mpumalanga, according to a police statement. It said the shots
were fired to disperse hostile crowds outside homes in the township,
but no details were given about the people involved or the cause of
the disturbance.
   Natal Province has been the site of a prolonged conflict between
members of Inkatha, a relatively conservative Zulu organization, and
supporters of the United Democratic Front, a militant anti-apartheid
coalition. More than 1,000 people have been killed in violence in
Natal the last two years.
   In Durban Supreme Court, 11 men linked to Inkatha went on trial
this week charged with abducting and killing seven youths in March
1987. The assailants allegedly suspected that the youths were United
Democratic Front supporters.

<HEAD>U.S. Middle East Expert Tried To Free Hostages, ``Nightline''
Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Middle East expert who advised George Bush's
presidential campaign made an unsuccessful attempt to free the U.S.
hostages in Lebanon by meeting with Syrian officials, ABC-TV's
``Nightline'' reported.
   After the U.S. government learned of the meeting, Secretary of
State George Shultz told Syria that the expert, Paul Jureidini, in
no way represented the government, the program reported Thursday.
Shultz also told Jureidini to end any such contacts.
   A spokesman for Vice President Bush's campaign, Mark Goodin,
denied that Jureidini's Aug. 16 meeting was in any way sanctioned by
the campaign. As late as July, Jureidini served as an unpaid
consultant on the Middle East to the campaign, ``Nightline'' said.
   ``Nightline'' also reported that the release last month of
hostage Mithileshwar Singh, an Indian professor who is a legal
resident of the United States, followed third-party contacts between
the United States and Iran.
   The intermediary was West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher, the program said.
   Jureidini, who according to ``Nightline'' has been a frequent
Pentagon consultant and has top-level U.S. security clearance, said
on the program that he told his Syrian hosts during the meeting in
Damascus that he was acting on his own.
   He said he did not consider his meeting improper since he was
acting as a private citizen. Joining Jureidini at the meeting was
his partner, Ronald McLaurin.
   ``Nightline,'' quoting Syrian sources, reported that during the
meeting Jureidini and his hosts discussed options for securing the
release of the nine American hostages and what the impact of their
release would be on the U.S. presidential election.
   Before the release of Singh, Shultz used Genscher to tell Iran
that the U.S. hostages must be freed if there is to be real progress
in improving U.S.-Iranian relations, ``Nightline'' reported.
   Following this contact, substantial pressure was exerted on the
Hezbollah, the radical group in Lebanon believed to be holding the
hostages, the program said. That pressure led to Singh's release, it
said.
   Afterward, the U.S. government sent word to Iran via the Japanese
government that all the U.S. hostages must be released, and that
there would be no deal and no negotiations, ``Nightline'' reported.
   The program quoted Iranian officials as saying they considered
that response an insult; that Iran was not trying to make a deal,
only to start a process that would lead to the release of the other
hostages.
   From the Iranian perspective, the Singh release was a gesture
that could have led to more releases, ``Nightline'' said. But the
U.S. response, in the Iranian view, resulted in the door slamming
shut, it reported.
   U.S. officials told the program that the response was consistent
with U.S. policy on the hostages.
   ``Nightline'' reported that Iran said it was contacted about the
release of the hostages by numerous people who claimed to represent
either the U.S. government or the presidential campaigns of Bush or
Michael Dukakis.
   Spokesmen for both campaigns denied they had authorized any such
contacts, and Iran refused to provide names or other details, the
show reported.
   The number of such contacts was so great that in October, the
Iranian government complained in an official message to the U.S.
government, ``Nightline'' reported.
   In early October, Shultz announced that such contacts were
unauthorized and that those making them should ``butt out'' and let
the State Department handle the hostage situation.

<HEAD>Socialist Mayor Wages Strong Campaign for Vermont's Lone House Seat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MEG DENNISON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In his five previous statewide campaigns,
Bernard Sanders has been called spoiler and fringe candidate. Now in
his sixth political campaign, he's sporting a new label: contender.
   The socialist mayor of Vermont's largest city is running as an
independent for the state's lone seat in the U.S. House. He is
campaigning on the theme of shaking up Washington. And polls
indicate voters are buying his message.
   ``We have reached the stage where people are prepared to vote
their conscience, and for me that is a great step forward,'' Sanders
said this week while he held his signs and waved to motorists in
front of an IBM plant.
   His candidacy's strength is showing in campaign financing:
Sanders has raised $224,059, less than the $309,226 raised by
Republican Peter Smith, but more than the $199,577 raised by the
Democratic nominee, House Majority Leader Paul Poirier.
   And his strength is shown by a growing number of hard-line
Democrats who are switching to Sanders. Former Attorney General M.
Jerome Diamond, the 1980 Democratic gubernatorial nominee, said he's
backing Sanders over Poirier.
   ``I'm not willing to throw my vote away,'' said Diamond. ``Paul's
candidacy at this point is not one in which we can give our vote and
expect it not to be lost.''
   An independent poll of likely voters conducted in early October
gave Sanders nearly 25 percent of the vote, behind Smith's 39
percent. Poirier had 17 percent.
   A Sanders' tracking poll early last week showed Sanders closing
the gap on Smith, with undecided voters going to Sanders and Poirier.
   Sanders has worked in Vermont as a carpenter, youth counselor,
free-lance writer and film maker. He produced 25 films on New
England history, two television productions, one on socialist Eugene
V. Debs and one on poverty in Vermont, and several radio programs on
Vermont history.
   In the 1970s, he was a perennial candidate of the Liberty Union,
a leftist party in Vermont. He ran for governor and U.S. Senate, but
garnered few votes.
   In 1976 Sanders quit the party and later began concentrating his
political efforts in Burlington. In 1981 he ran for mayor as an
independent and ousted the longtime Democratic incumbent by 10
votes, an election that shocked the political establishment.
   He proved his election was no fluke by winning re-election in
1983, 1985 and 1987 and gaining national acclaim for his work as
mayor.
   Two years ago Sanders returned to statewide politics, as an
independent, winning 14 percent of the vote in a three-way race for
governor.
   If he won, Sanders would be one of the few socialists in Congress
and the only one to be elected as an independent. Other socialists
who have gone to Congress have been elected on the Republican or
Democratic tickets. The last time a representative won election as a
socialist was in 1929.
   Sanders has campaigned on promises of shaking up Capitol Hill
just as he's has made some waves in Vermont, and he's argued that
he'd be good for Vermont precisely because he has no debts to a
party.
   Though he wins widespread praise for being an effective mayor,
his style is often criticized as too confrontational. But some who
have worked with him call him an adroit politician.
   ``The people who don't deal with him are the people who think
he's an ineffective radical with hot matches stuck between his
toes,'' said Stephen Jeffrey, executive director of a lobbying group
representing most Vermont municipalities.
   ``You're just about to say, `I'm going to fight this guy to the
bitter end,' and you find yourself linking arms with him,'' said
Jeffrey.

   The General Assembly has overwhelmingly
condemned Israel for beating, wounding, killing and deporting
Palestinans since the uprising began Dec. 8 in the occupied
territories.
   Only the United States and Israel voted Thursday against the
resolution, while 130 nations voted for it. Sixteen abstained,
including Britain and Canada.
   The resolution said the assembly ``condemns Israel's persistent
policies and practices violating the human rights of the Palestinian
people in the occupied territories, including Jerusalem.''
   Every year, the General Assembly overwhelmingly condemns Israeli
human rights practices in the occupied territories.
   U.S. Ambassador Herbert S. Okun, the deputy permanent
representative, said the resolution ``is an unbalanced document,
condemning one of the parties for its actions without taking into
account acts of violence by the other side.
   ``The security of the state of Israel must be assured. At the
same time, the legitimate political rights of the Palestinian people
must be recognized,'' Okun said.
   The resolution criticized Israeli troops and settlers for
shooting and wounding ``defenseless Palestinian civilians, the
beating and breaking of bones, deportation, imposition of
restrictive economic measures, demolition of houses, collective
punishment and detentions, as well as denial of access to the
media.''
   It also ``demands that Israel, the occupying power, abide
immediately and scrupulously'' by the 4th Geneva Convention on
protection of civilians in time of war.
   M. Nasser al-Kidwa, the PLO's deputy U.N. representative, said
that since the uprising began nearly 11 months ago, 411 civilians
were killed through Oct. 30 and 4,500 wounded.
   The toll, he said, includes 273 people who were shot by the army,
37 shot by Israeli settlers, 36 killed in beatings or under
``mysterious conditions'' and 65 by tear gas.
   He charged that 11,400 Palestinians were detained without trial.
   Other estimates place the death toll at 306 Palestinians and 10
Israelis.
   Israeli Ambassador Johanan Bein responded by condemning
Palestinian guerrillas for burning families alive in firebombings,
bombing civilian buses and throwing grenades at sidewalk cafes and
toy shops full of children.
   An annual U.N. report released Thursday said the human rights
situation in Israel's occupied territories has deteriorated
dramatically since the Palestinian uprising began.
   The report said Israel's occupation of the West Bank, Gaza Strip
and Jerusalem since the 1967 Middle East war is itself a violation
of human rights.
   It cited shootings and abuse of civilians, including women and
children, deportation of activists, detention of thousands of
Palestinians under harsh conditions, the bulldozing of houses,
imposition of extended curfews, economic sanctions, restricted
freedom of expression, religion and travel.
   The report said several thousand Palestinians still are detained
and denied a fair trial.
   Israel does not cooperate with the special committee, which bases
its reports on interviews and reports from numerous sources,
including respected Israeli newspapers.

<HEAD>Snow Covers The Rockies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A storm packing at least 6 inches of snow and strong winds moved
through the Colorado Rockies today as a tornado downed trees in
Florida and showers and thunderstorms fell over much of the Midwest.
   Winter Park and Echo Lake, Colo., each received 6 inches of new
snow, and an additional 1 to 3 inches was expected.
   An advisory for snow and blowing snow was in effect for the
northern and central mountains of Colorado. Strong winds were
expected to cause blowing, drifing snow in mountain passes.
   A tornado spawned by a strong thunderstorm felled trees, some
onto houses, in a residential neighborhood just south of Fort Myers,
Fla., officials said. There were no reports of injuries, said Lee
County Sheriff's Deputy Alan Bromley.
   Showers and thunderstorms fell from southern Minnesota to
southern Missouri, and showers dampened parts of western Nebraska,
western Kansas and eastern Colorado.
   Scattered showers fell over Illinois, Indiana, eastern Ohio and
western Pennsylvania.
   In southeast Wyoming, a high wind watch was in effect. Winds
gusted Thursday night to 50 mph in Laramie and 49 mph in Cheyenne.
   Scattered light rain fell in lower elevations of Washington state
and in northwest Oregon. A snow advisory was posted for passes in
the Cascades in Washington state over 4,000 feet.
   Today's forecast called for rain from the upper Great Lakes to
the middle Mississippi, lower Ohio and Tennessee valleys; showers
and thunderstorms across the South from the lower Mississippi Valley
to the southern Atlantic Coast; scattered rain from the northern
Plains to the lower Great Lakes and upper Ohio Valley; scattered
showers along the northern Pacific Coast; and sometimes-gusty winds
from the northern and central Rockies to the middle and lower
Missouri Valley.
   High temperatures were predicted to be in the 60s or 70s across
much of the nation; the 50s from the Pacific Northwest to the
northern Rockies, northern Plains, lower Great Lakes and the
northern half of New England; the 40s over the upper Mississippi
Valley and the upper Great Lakes; the 80s acorss central and
southern Florida and from Louisiana to central and western Texas and
the desert Southwest; and the 90s in southern Texas and southwest
Arizona.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 24
degrees at Lebanon, N.H., to 81 degrees at Key West, Fla., Naval Air

   The likelihood Yitzhak Shamir will head a
right-wing government increases the prospect of more confrontation
with Palestinians and promises little real movement in the overall
Arab-Israeli conflict.
   On Thursday, Shamir turned down the most extreme proposals on the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip _ expelling Palestinians from the
land and annexing it outright.
   But according to aide Yossi Ahimeir, the prime minister promised
potential partners in a coalition led by his right-wing Likud bloc
that he would build more Jewish settlements in the occupied West
Bank.
   Already, much of the violence in the occupied lands begins with
stoning or firebombing of Israeli cars as Jewish settlers drive from
their enclaves through land whose 1.5 million Arab residents want as
an independent Palestinian nation.
   Often the settlers are armed. The army also responds with gunfire
and by tearing down Palestinian homes when firebombs are thrown.
More than 300 Arabs and 10 Israelis have died in the nearly 11-month
Palestinian uprising.
   Now, more than 70,000 Jews live in about 130 settlements. The
settler movement Gush Emunim, or ``Bloc of the Faithful,'' said
Thursday it hopes to start 11 more this month and build a total of
50 within three years.
   In addition to the potential for violence inherent in more
settlements, Shamir will be under intense pressure to forcefully put
down the ``intefadeh,'' the revolt against Israel's 21-year
occupation.
   Among those he is talking to as coalition partners are far-right
and religious parties, some of which want to expel the Arabs and
take over the West Bank and Gaza Strip as part of biblical Israel.
   They are not likely to be conciliatory toward the Palestinians,
who are themselves angry their uprising brought no political gains.
   Said Kenaan, a pro-PLO West Bank businessman, said Tuesday's vote
showed Israelis don't want peace and added: ``We will hit back. The
moderate voice in the Palestinian camp is finished.''
   Eytan Gilboa, a Hebrew University political science professor,
said an escalated cycle of violence could grow out of Palestinian
anger and pressures on the government to end the uprising.
   ``If the levels of violence go up, if there are more firebombs,
if weapons are used, Israel will respond with fire,'' he said.
   Much of the election campaign focused on the future of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. The vote was advertised as a crucial choice
between the left-leaning Labor Party's plan to give up land for
peace and Likud's hard-line refusal to do so.
   In the end, the balloting gave a boost to religious parties but
left unanswered the question of what to do with the occupied lands.
Likud and Labor each got only about one-third of the vote.
   Analyst Yosef Goell, writing in the English-language Jerusalem
Post, called the outcome ``a recipe of continued paralysis.'' Shamir
will likely head a right-wing coalition or bring Labor in as a
junior partner.
   His ideas will dominate and they do not promise movement. He has
rejected an international peace conference urged by the Arabs and
endorsed by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of Labor.
   He refuses to give up occupied land, his mentor Prime Minister
Menachem Begin's way of making peace with Egypt in 1979. He offers
``autonomy'' to the Palestinians under the Camp David accords, with
the future status of the occupied lands to be worked out later.
   Shamir said last week that his election would signal the Arabs
that peace could only be achieved if Egypt, Jordan and moderate
Palestinians join in direct talks with Israel based on the 1978
U.S.-sponsored accords.
   But Hanna Siniora, a Palestinian moderate and editor of the
pro-PLO Al-Fajr newspaper, said the Arabs will reject Shamir's
effort to resuscitate the Camp David peace formula.
   When asked how Palestinians would deal with a Likud-led
government, he replied: ``We will have to cope with a difficult
situation and make these parties abandon the ideas of Camp David,
which are not acceptable to anyone in the Arab world.''

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis has pulled within 4 percentage
points of George Bush in Michigan, according to a poll in today's
editions of The Detroit News.
   The News poll of 1,021 registered voters gave Bush a 48 percent
to 44 percent edge over Dukakis. The survey was conducted Monday
through Wednesday for The News by Gordon S. Black Corp. and has an
error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
   ``This state is up for grabs. This weekend will determine who
wins Michigan,'' said Anthony M. Casale, a spokesman for the
Washington-based Gordon S. Black.
   Both candidates are scheduled to campaign in Michigan the next
few days. Bush was to appear at Schoolcraft College in Livonia
today, while Dukakis is to appear in Taylor on Saturday.
   President Reagan will campaign on Bush's behalf on Saturday at
Macomb Community College south campus in Warren.
   In mid-October Bush held a substantial lead over Dukakis in most
Michigan polls, but Dukakis has apparently been able to erase most
of that advantage.

<HEAD>Pro-PLO Daily Publishes Draft Declaration Of Independence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pro-PLO daily newspaper Al Fajr today
published a draft declaration of independence for a Palestinian
state.
   The Arabic-language newspaper said speaker Abdul Hamid Al Sayeh
would present the document for approval to the 453-member Palestine
National Council, or PLO parliament in exile, on Nov. 14 in Algeria.
   A map accompanying the document shows the land to be divided into
two states, one Israeli and one Arab, on the basis of a 1947 U.N.
partition resolution, the mainstream Palestine Liberation
Organization newspaper said.
   Israel rejects the 1947 partition plan, which awards key areas of
what is now Israel to the Arabs as well as the Israeli-occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip. It also calls for international control of
Jerusalem, which Israel has proclaimed as its capital.
   However, Palestinian commentators said the PLO's expected
acceptance of two states would be a step toward peace because it
implicitly recognized the right of a Jewish state to exist.
   Al Fajr Editor Hanna Siniora said the expected formation of a
right-wing Israeli government in the wake of this week's elections
would discourage the PLO from making a clearer statement about its
willingness to recognize Israel and make peace.
   ``There is nothing on the Israeli side to indicate there would be
a reciprocation,'' he said. ``It would create dissention in the PLO
camp for nothing.''
   Daoud Kuttab, a leading Palestinian journalist, said the
declaration was positive because it would recognize two states, one
Arab and one Jewish. This would be a change from the PLO's previous
demand for a single, secular state.
   ``I think it's very good, but the problem for peacemaking is that
you need a partner,'' he said, adding that boundaries were a
question that could be settled by negotiation.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who is expected to form a
right-wing government in the coming days, said such a document would
be harmful for the peace process.
   ``It will become an additional obstacle to improving the
situation. After such extreme declarations, it will become for them
painful to retreat,'' Shamir told The Associated Press Oct. 28.
   He said Israel would never accept creation of a Palestinian
state, which he claimed was merely a step toward the PLO's goal of
taking all the land for itself.

<TEXT>
   A television show on ``hatemongers'' being taped
by Geraldo Rivera erupted into a brawl that left the host with a
broken nose and what he said was a hard-earned lesson: ``Throw the
first punch next time.''
   The melee broke out Thursday when a young white supremacist
uttered racist remarks, prompting black civil rights leader Roy
Innis to grab him by the neck. Pushing and shoving followed,
``skinheads'' stormed the stage and chairs and punches were thrown.
   ``I've been in plenty of scrapes before, but never in a studio,''
Rivera said afterward. ``I never expected this. I anticipated heated
words, but I didn't know it would boil into violence.''
   Rivera concluded the taping and taped two more shows before
having his nose X-rayed. He said his nose was broken. ``It clicks
when I move it,'' he said.
   During the brawl, which last about a minute, Rivera got into a
toe-to-toe fistfight with a burly man who threw a chair. At some
point, he was hit in the nose by another chair, he said.
   ``It was like a bench-clearing brawl at a hockey match,'' Rivera
said. ``About a dozen of them came out of the audience. The three
punks on stage would have been easy to handle.''
   The brawl started when one of the guests on the show, John
Metzger, the 20-year-old leader of the White Aryan Resistance Youth,
complained about ``kikes'' and called Innis an ``Uncle Tom.''
   Innis walked across the set to Metzger, his fists balled, then
turned to another panelist who was warning him off. Metzger then
began to stand and Innis put his hands around Metzger's neck.
   ``I moved on him,'' Innis said. ``A guy's gonna jump up in my
face, I'm not going to wait for damage. He got the Sharpton
treatment.''
   Earlier this year, Innis had a run-in with New York City activist
Al Sharpton, shoving him to the floor on the Morton Downey Show.
   When Metzger resisted, his supporters moved toward Innis. Punches
were thrown, several people were wrestled and pushed to the floor
and audience members _ ``skinheads'' among them _ stormed the set,
the videotape showed.
   Pushing and shoving matches continued as order was restored.
   ``It confirmed to me that these (supremacists) are roaches, and
the only way to get rid of roaches is to turn the lights on,''
Rivera said.
   The show featured members of the White Aryan Resistance Youth,
The American Front and Skinheads of the National Resistance. Many
ultra right-wing group members have adopted close-cropped hairstyles.
   Other guests included Rabbi A. Bruce Goldman; Innis, the national
chairman of the Congress of Racial Equality; and Bayonne, N.J.,
resident Bill Stump and his wife, who said they were attacked and
terrorized by skinheads at a train station in Manhattan Saturday
night.
   Rivera defended Innis' actions, saying, ``The only lesson I
learned is to throw the first punch next time.''
   Police spokesman Janice Swinney said Rivera declined to press
charges. She said no one was arrested and no other injuries were
reported.
   Meanwhile, in Tampa, Fla., Rivera's syndicated hour-long program
was tied to a murder.
   Jonathan Cantero, 19, charged in the knifing death of his mother,
told police he got the courage to kill after watching Rivera's
syndicated program on Oct. 6, in which Satan-obsessed youths
described the horrors of occult animal sacrifices.
   He gave a detailed account of his own obsession with Satanism and
events leading up to the Oct. 12 slaying, authorities said this week.

<HEAD>1,400 Workers Checked For Plutonium Contamination</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Savannah River Plant officials checked 1,400
workers for contamination after discovering that three more workers
had inadvertently come into contact with radioactive material.
   All 1,400 came up clean Thursday, said Becky Apter, a spokeswoman
for Du Pont, which runs the nuclear weaponry fuel plant here for the
U.S. Department of Energy.
   Wednesday's discovery brings to 17 the number of workers who have
come into contact with plutonium in an outside area near the plant's
chemical separations facility. Contamination was found on the shoes
of the first 14.
   On Wednesday, three construction workers discovered a ``very low
level'' of plutonium on their hands as they left one of the chemical
separations buildings, said Bill Reinig, Du Pont health protection
superintendent.
   He said officials still do not know the source of the plutonium
contamination. The plant is the nation's sole producer of
weapons-grade plutonium and tritium.
   Reinig said monitors show none of the contamination was carried
off the plant site.
   Since April, all three of the plant's reactors have been closed
for maintenance amid safety questions.
   Concerns about safety increased dramatically in early October,
when it was disclosed that a number of near-accidents and releases
of radioactive materials at the plant over the last three decades
were not reported to Energy Department headquarters or to the public.
   Plant and government officials say they are working to correct
the problems.

<HEAD>Company To Build Frozen Blood Center In Memphis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A company plans to build a storage center
for people who want their own blood frozen and available for quick
delivery if they need it, but a doctor says the concern is preying
on people's fear of AIDS.
   Daxor Corp. of New York will store blood for individuals at the
Federal Express nationwide shipping hub in Memphis, Daxor Vice
President Allen Gelb said Thursday.
   ``It is aimed at anyone who wants to store their own blood or
blood for their family because they are afraid of or reluctant to
get blood from the general population because of the risk of
transfusion,'' Gelb said.
   But Dr. Edward Scott, director of LifeBlood, the Mid-South
Regional Blood Center, said the odds are one in 100,000 of
contracting acquired immune deficiency syndrome from a blood
transfusion.
   ``They undermine public confidence in the blood supply and
exaggerate the risk of transfusion to promote their service,'' said
Scott.
   Federal Express spokesman Armand Schneider said he couldn't
discuss details of his company's agreement with Daxor. ``We will
provide some logistic services, including storage and
transportation,'' he said.
   Federal Express, an international package courier service,
contracts with about 135 other customers to stockpile items for
emergency shipment.
   Daxor says it was the first company to market individual blood
storage, opening a New York facility in 1985. Gelb declined to say
how many customers the New York center had or how many Americans
they expect will buy the service. Plans call for operating centers
in New York and Memphis.
   The company recommends that individuals store two units each of
red blood cells and plasma, Gelb said. There would be a $170
one-time fee for drawing and processing that blood. It would then
cost an additional $492 annually to store those blood components.
The person also would pay any transport costs.
   Lifeblood will also store an individual's red blood cells for up
to 10 years, Scott said. The center's total charge for two units
would be $300 for that time period. If the blood were needed outside
Memphis, the center would charge $150 for transportation. Scott said
the center could also store plasma and estimated that might cost
another $80.
   Daxor promises Federal Express delivery of the frozen blood
products anywhere in the nation within six hours. ``Less than 5
percent of people getting transfused are transfused within the first
couple of hours,'' Gelb said.
   Scott said that in an emergency a person would need and receive
blood immediately from a blood bank.

<HEAD>New Afrikaans Newspaper Is Launched, Predicts Mandela Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new Afrikaans-language weekly
newspaper went on sale today, with a front-page story predicting
African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela will soon be freed.
   Called Free Weekly, the newspaper describes itself as politically
independent and gave extensive coverage in its premier issue to
controversial political topics.
   On its front page, in addition to a story speculating Mandela
might be freed Nov. 14, it carried a photograph of two liberal
Afrikaners at a recent meeting in West Germany with leaders of the
outlawed African National Congress.
   The ANC is fighting the white-led government and its policies of
apartheid, or racial segregation.
   The two Afrikaners flanked Joe Slovo, an ANC executive committee
member who is head of the outlawed South African Communist Party and
is depicted by South African government officials as a terrorist.
   South Africa's daily Afrikaans newspapers generally support the
government, although Beeld _ the largest-circulation Afrikaans daily
_ has differed with President P.W. Botha on several issues in recent
months.
   Botha's National Party is dominated by Afrikaners, the mainly
Dutch-descended whites whose forebears arrived in South Africa
beginning in 1652 and who now make up 60 percent of the 5-million
white minority.
   The majority 26 million blacks in South Africa have no vote in
national affairs and are separated from whites by housing, schools
and health services.
   Free Weekly said, without attribution, that Nov. 14 was a
possible date for release of Mandela, 70, has been imprisoned since
1962 and is serving a life sentence for plotting sabotage to
overthrow white-minority rule.
   Mandela is considered the most popular leader among the black
majority and there has been a worldwide campaign seeking his release.
   The newspaper also suggested Mandela might be freed in
conjunction with possible visits to South Africa by British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher or President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire.
   Mandela was stricken with tuberculosis in August and is
recuperating at a private clinic in Cape Town. Botha has said he
would prefer Mandela not be returned to Pollsmoor Prison.
   Mandela is the past has turned down offers to go free in exchange
for renouncing the use of violence by ANC guerrillas.

   A fallen whiz kid testified that he tried to
hang himself in prison after he became despondent over demands
placed on him by organized crime figures.
   Barry Minkow, on trial in U.S. District Court on 57 counts of
securities, credit card and mail fraud stemming from the failure of
his ZZZZ Best carpet-cleaning firm, disclosed his suicide attempt
Thursday during cross-examination.
   The prosecutor later dismissed Minkow's claim as a fabrication.
``It's the first anybody's heard about it,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney
James Asperger said.
   Defense attorney David Kenner, when told the prosecutor had
suggested Minkow had invented the suicide attempt, said he had heard
about it.
   Minkow, 22, was totally distraught, Kenner said, adding, ``My
understanding was he decided to just end it all.''
   He was 16 when he started the company in his parents' garage and
21 when it collapsed. Major banks and private investors lost at
least $25 million invested in the firm, according to the government.
   Minkow has argued that he was forced to swindle investors out of
millions by mobsters who took control of his company.
   He admitted to many lies under Asperger's cross-examination, and
at one point, U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian asked: ``When
did you start lying?''
   ``In 1983,'' said Minkow.
   ``When did you stop lying?'' asked the judge.
   ``At Terminal Island (prison) after I tried to hang myself,'' he
said.
   Minkow added that afterward his attorney, Kenner, ``told me
either face this or you go to jail for 500 years _ that's when I
stopped lying.''

   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
unveiled a memorial today to a British plane crew shot down in 1944
while trying to aid the Polish resistance. The only survivor of the
crash, 65-year-old LLoyd Lane, looked on.
   Mrs. Thatcher, on the final day of her three-day visit to Poland,
cut a ribbon encircling a rough stone memorial with a bronze plaque
erected on the spot where six Royal Air Force crew members died.
   The British prime minister then laid a wreath at the base of the

brief ceremony in a park in the city's eastern Praga district.
   Lane, now a farmer in Cornwall, southwest England, earlier
described how the Liberator bomber was hit by German anti-aircraft
fire as it flew low on an August night.
   ``We were taking supplies from Italy to the Polish Home Army, who
were rising against the Germans and were short of ammunition, guns,
medical equipment and food,'' said Lane, accompanied to the ceremony
by his wife Trevis.
   ``We ran into heavy anti-aircraft fire and were hit at about 400
feet,'' he said. ``I woke up about four hours later. Amazingly, I
had no broken bones, just burns to my face and knees.''
   He said, ``I was either blown out, thrown out or fell out of the
gun apertures either when the aircraft crashed or when it was in the
air. I had no parachute and I shall never know what happened.''
   He called for help and was captured by the Germans, who
eventually took him to a prisoner-of-war camp.
   After the memorial ceremony, Mrs. Thatcher left for Gdansk to
meet Lech Walesa, leader of the banned Solidarity trade union.

<HEAD>Seniors Mistrust, Avoid Flu, Pneumonia Vaccines, Study Says</HEAD>

   Many elderly people who are fearful of adverse
effects from flu vaccine or skeptical of its effectiveness don't get
recommended annual flu shots, which could save thousands of lives,
according to a government report.
   About 60,000 deaths are reported from flu and pneumonia in the
United States each year, mostly among people 65 and over, the
national Centers for Disease Control said Thursday.
   ``Although safe, effective and inexpensive vaccines are available
for these diseases, only about 22 percent (of people 65 and up
nationwide) receive influenza vaccine annually,'' the CDC said.
   For pneumococcal vaccine, designed to prevent pneumonia and its
complications, the numbers are even lower: only 10 percent have ever
received the one-time-only shot.
   Influenza and pneumococcal vaccines are recommended by federal
health officials for all persons 65 and over, because of seniors'
increased risk of complications or death from pneumonia and flu.
   One study conducted this summer in metropolitan Atlanta indicated
the reason for low vaccine use among seniors may be mistrust of the
vaccines, not ignorance.
   Among 716 senior citizens surveyed in Fulton and DeKalb counties,
90 percent were aware of flu vaccine and 53 percent were aware of
pneumococcal vaccine. But only 55 percent received annual flu shots,
and only 38 percent had received pneumococcal vaccine.
   ``Many individuals may refuse the vaccines over concerns over
adverse effects,'' said Dr. Walter W. Williams, a CDC immunization
specialist. ``If there's one thing that may influence someone to
take or not take a vaccine, it's fear of side effects.''
   Seventy-three percent of the senior citizens in the Atlanta
survey who were aware of influenza vaccine reported ``negative
attitudes'' about it _ usually the feeling that it causes illness,
doesn't work, or isn't necessary, the CDC said.
   ``A lot of those fears are unfounded,'' Williams said, adding
that today's flu vaccines are much safer than vaccines of a
generation or two ago.
   The negative attitudes remained even among those getting flu
shots; half of those with such attitudes reported they'd had their
flu shots anyway.
   In the Atlanta survey, doctors' recommendations appeared to carry
a lot of weight with the older patients. Seventy-five percent of
those to whom a health-care provider had recommended flu vaccine
reported getting their annual shot, compared to just 7 percent of
those who had not received such a recommendation. For pneumococcal
vaccine, the percentages were similar: 76 percent and 6 percent, the
CDC said.
   ``It's very, very important for health care providers to ...
discuss those issues with patients,'' Williams said.
   While the Atlanta results cannot be projected for the nation as a
whole, they are of importance to researchers because ``they are
similar to other findings'' from more comprehensive studies,
Williams said.
   Flu kills about 20,000 Americans each year, while another 40,000
deaths result from pneumonia; more than 80 percent of those deaths
occur in people over 65, according to the CDC.
   In younger adults, flu vaccine is as much as 90 percent effective
in preventing flu entirely, Williams said. Absolute effectiveness is
lower in older persons _ between 40 and 60 percent _ but the
effectiveness in preventing serious complications and death remains
around 75 percent, he said.
   Pneumococcal vaccine is believed to be between 60 and 95 percent
effective in preventing pneumonia, Williams said.

<HEAD>Injuries to Steinberg's Companion Shock Jurors in Child-Killer Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jurors in the trial of a man accused of killing
an illegally adopted child watched in horror as a videotape showed
extensive bruises, lacerations and other injuries suffered by his
live-in companion.
   Some jurors put their hands to their faces and others turned
their heads Thursday as the 5{-minute tape revealed Hedda Nussbaum's
bruises, open wounds, patches of missing hair and a discolored left
leg.
   The tape, shot at a police station by a technician from the
Manhattan district attorney's office, showed the 46-year-old woman a
short time after she and Joel Steinberg were arrested Nov. 2, 1987,
in connection with the death of their illegally adopted daughter,
6-year-old Lisa Steinberg.
   The tape was used to buttress testimony of police officers,
paramedics and social workers that on the morning the child was
taken unconscious from the Steinberg household, Ms. Nussbaum
appeared battered and bruised, passive and lethargic.
   Prosecutors believe the videotape would show jurors the allegedly
violent conditions in the household and explain why Ms. Nussbaum did
not call for help for at least 10 hours after Lisa fell unconscious.
   ``Steinberg totally dominated Ms. Nussbaum both physically and
psychologically,'' said Assistant District Attorney John McCusker,
one of the prosecutors.
   But Steinberg's lawyer, Ira London, objected to the tape, calling
it ``inflammatory and prejudicial.'' London said there was no proven
connection between his client and Ms. Nussbaum's injuries, and even
if there were, it would be irrelevant to the murder trial.
   ``I don't see how this (tape) can come in (as evidence), since
there is no evidence that physical abuse had anything to do with her
(Ms. Nussbaum's) behavior,'' he said.
   Ms. Nussbaum has never said she failed to call for help for the
child because she feared Steinberg's retribution, he said. ``It was
her mistaken belief that Joel had powers to heal Lisa,'' London said.
   The color videotape showed Ms. Nussbaum raising her black
turtleneck sweater and pulling down her jeans while a female police
officer pointed with a ruler to show the size and location of
bruises and open wounds.
   When Ms. Nussbaum held her head forward, the tape revealed
patches of hair were missing from her scalp. Her right eye was
blackened; she had an open wound over the bridge of an apparently
broken nose; her lips were swollen and one was split; and she had
other injuries on her torso.
   Her buttocks were bruised, her left thigh was almost totally
discolored, and her left leg had open wounds and discoloration. Ms.
Nussbaum's right leg was ulcerated from the knee down to the ankle,
with bandages in various places.
   Charges against Ms. Nussbaum, Steinberg's live-in companion for
12 years, were dropped two weeks ago. She is expected to testify for
the prosecution about alleged violence that led to the fatal
injuries of the child.
   Lisa was taken to nearby St. Vincent's Hospital on the morning of
Nov. 2, 1987 and died three days later of a head injury.
   A 16-month-old boy, Mitchell, was found in the apartment sitting
in a dirty diaper and tethered to a playpen, authortities said. He
also was illegally adopted and now lives with his biological mother.
   Steinberg, 47, a disbarred lawyer, is on trial for second-degree
murder. He denies that he hit the child. He said she choked on
vomited food and the bruises on her chest and back resulted from his
trying to revive her. He is jailed without bail.
   Ms. Nussbaum, a former children's book editor, has had several
operations for injuries her lawyer, Barry Scheck, said she suffered
at Steinberg's hands. She also has been under psychiatric care for
nearly a year at a Westchester County facility.

   A man who sneaked into a wild animal park
to steal meat was caught and devoured by lions, a Zimbabwe newspaper
reported today.
   The unidentified intruder's remains were found last week by a
warden at the Lion and Cheetah Park near Harare, The Herald
newspaper said.
   ``He got into a cage with four very bad lions,'' Vivian Bristow,
owner of the park, was quoted as saying. She told the newspaper the
man was believed to have entered the cage to steal meat left for the
animals. There are 32 lions at the park.
   All that remained of the man were bones, an identity card and a

<HEAD>Six Charged In Scheme To Smuggle Rhinceros Horns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEAN GOLEMBESKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two South African army officers were among
six people indicted on charges that they smuggled precious
rhinoceros horns, skins of other endangered animals and AK-47
machine guns into the United States.
   The six were caught in an undercover investigation that began in
February, U.S. Attorney Stanley A. Twardy Jr. said Thursday. More
arrests are possible, he added.
   Twardy said he had no idea how long the smugglers had been in
business, nor was he able to say how many others did business with
the group. But those charged in the scheme indicated they had enough
rhino horns to earn hundreds of thousands of dollars.
   ``This is something that is unique, at least in my experience,
and from what I have been unable to uncover from the (Justice)
Department,'' Twardy said.
   The rhino horns are valued by some Orientals for their purported
medicinal and aphrodisiac properties. In the United States, rhino
horn powder can sell for up to $450 an ounce, Twardy said.
   Arrested were John C. Lukman Jr., 34, and Russell D. Beveridge
Jr., 32, both of Newington; and Mary Ann McAllister, 33, of West
Hartford, Twardy said.
   Also named in the complaint were Marius Meiring, a major in the
South African Defense Force; his wife, Pat Meiring; and Waldemar
Schutte, a South African sergeant major, Twardy said. All are South
African citizens and U.S. officials were seeking to have the three
extradited to the United States, Twardy said.
   The importation of rhino horn is illegal in most countries,
including the United States, because the animal is nearly extinct.
   Still, an illicit trade reportedly worth $3 million a year
flourishes in the Middle East and eastern Asia, where dealers pay
$450 a pound for it.
   Rhino horn is not actually a horn, but densely compacted fibers
of keratin, a protein found in hair and fingernails. In the Far
East, it is ground into traditional medicines that supposedly reduce
fever and stop nosebleeds. It is also treasured in Yemen, where it
is carved into dagger handles that sell for up to $15,000 each.
   Rhinoceroses are one of the more endangered animals in the world.
At one time 120 species lived, but only five species remain,
including black and white rhinos. Fewer than 4,000 black rhinos
remain today; about 85 percent of them live in South Africa, Nambia,
Zimbabwe and Kenya.
   A. Eugene Hester, the northeast regional director of the U.S.
Fish & Wildlife Service, said the seizure and purchase of the rhino
horns by undercover agents was the largest haul of its kind in the
United States.
   Each defendant was charged with conspriracy to commit an offense
against the United States, a crime that can be punished by up to
five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Twardy said other charges
would be filed.
   Lukman, McAllister and Beveridge appeared Thursday in U.S.
District Court in Hartford, where McAllister and Beveridge each were
released on $25,000 non-surety bonds.
   Lukman's case was to continue today. Twardy said authorities want
Lukman held without bail because they think he might leave the
country.

   It's 10 p.m. _ do you know where your inmates
are?
   That's how Allegheny County officials discovered there's a slight
loophole in their house arrest system, which uses electronic
bracelets to monitor inmates: No one is keeping tabs on prisoners
after 10 p.m.
   As a result, probation authorities said, they didn't know that
inmate Donald E. Knudson Jr. left his suburban Bethel Park home
without permission at 11:56 p.m. Friday, leading police on a
two-hour car chase.
   The special electronic bracelet Knudson was wearing properly
notified authorities that he had left his home, but no one was
watching the monitoring equipment, said John Kolesar, director of
the Allegheny County Adult Probation Office.
   ``I have six staff, and we don't have enough people to have
someone in the office after 10 p.m.,'' he said.
   Inmates assigned to house arrest wear bracelets on their ankles
or wrists that send signals through a special telephone receiver in
their homes. If they leave the range of the receiver, a signal
notifies a computer in the county probation office.
   Kolesar said he needs two more staff members, at a cost of about
$50,000, to monitor house-arrest prisoners 24 hours a day.
   But he said the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Deliquency
will not approve additional staff members under its grant to start
the program and the county has refused to hire them.

<TEXT>
   The United Nations should devise an emergency
system to protect small nations such as the Maldives from invasion
by foreign troops, mercenaries or terrorists, Commonwealth
Secretary-General Sir Sridath Ramphal says.
   ``If they can get away with it in the Maldives, no small state in
the Pacific, in the Caribbean, (or) in the Indian Ocean is safe from
this kind of mercenary insurgency and incursion,'' Ramphal said
Thursday in a television interview.
   Ramphal is the top official of the 48-nation commonwealth of
Britain and its former colonies.
   The British government said the Maldivian government's request
Thursday for military assistance to help fight off a coup attempt by
foreign mercenaries had been overtaken by India's decision to rush
in troops.
   At least 12 people were reported killed in battles between the
gunmen and loyalist troops.
   About 500 Britons were believed to be vacationing on the tropical
Indian Ocean archipelago, but there were no reports of British
casualties, the spokesman said. The islands were under the
protection of the British crown until 1952.

<TEXT>
   The National Council of Churches, long
identified with liberal Protestantism, is increasingly finding
itself on the sidelines in the country's political discourse, the
organization's board said in voting to reorganize.
   The governing board also approved a statement Thursday that calls
for the council to consider joining forces with more conservative,
but growing, Protestant evangelical and Roman Catholic groups.
   ``Such a process would entail a willingness on the part of the
N.C.C. and its programs to die in order that new life might spring
forth as a stronger witness to our unity in Christ,'' the statement
said.
   The N.C.C., founded in 1950, has grown to represent 32
Protestant, Anglican and Eastern Orthodox denominations. It has
adopted a number of liberal positions, including opposition to
prayer in public schools and the death penalty, and has spoken out
against President Reagan's Central American policies and apartheid
in South Africa.
   However, the Rev. Arie R. Brouwer, the council's general
secretary, told the board that the number of liberal Protestants is
declining, that they are donating less to their churches and that
their agenda was never less in vogue.
   The council's research office reported a 53 percent decrease in
member contributions since 1976.
   ``Today, we are likely to be known as the old-line or even the
sideline churches, instead of mainline,'' he said.
   The board created a 15-member panel to work out a reorganization
plan and told it to have a report ready by May.
   It also approved a $53 million budget for 1989 that officials
said included deep cuts in staff and programs, although they were
not specified.

<TEXT>
   A former police officer was convicted of
first-degree murder in the contract killing of a businessman whose
body is still missing.
   Robert Von Villas, 44, of Simi Valley also was found guilty
Thursday of conspiracy to murder. His murder conviction carries
special allegations for which he could face the gas chamber.
   Von Villas was convicted of the death of Thomas Weed, 52, of
Northridge, who disappeared from his San Fernando Valley apartment
Feb. 23, 1983.
   Von Villas and co-defendant Richard Herman Ford, 48, also a
former police officer, were accused of taking $20,000 from Weed's
ex-wife, Janie Ogilvie, to kill Weed.
   Ford was convicted of Weed's murder on Oct. 11. The penalty phase
of his trial begins Monday. The penalty phase of Von Villas' trial
is scheduled to begin Nov. 28.
   Ms. Ogilvie pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and is serving
a 15-year-to-life sentence.
   Ms. Ogilvie, who said Weed beat her, testified she hired the
former policemen to kill her husband and that they told her no one
would ever find the body. It is believed to be buried in the Mojave
Desert.
   Defense attorneys called Ms. Ogilvie ``crazy'' and said she was
trying to escape the death penalty in testifying against the former
officers. They also said prosecutors failed to prove Weed was killed.
   In January, Von Villas and Ford were convicted of attempting to
murder a nude dancer in order to collect $100,000 in life insurance.
They also were found guilty of staging a $210,000 jewelry heist in
1982.

   Flora Rheta Schreiber, who wrote the best seller,
``Sybil,'' about a woman with multiple personalities, has died of a
heart attack at age 70.
   Schreiber, a professor of English and speech at John Jay College
of Criminal Justice, died Thursday at Beth Israel Hospital in
Manhattan.
   ``Sybil,'' a 1973 case study of a woman with 16 distinct
personalities, was turned into a two-part NBC-TV movie in 1976.
   Her book, ``Shoemaker,'' about Joseph Kallinger, a shoemaker who
killed three people in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, was published in
1983.
   It was intended to show ``it's even more important to prevent the
development of psychosis that leads to crime than to get tough with
criminals after the event,'' she said while researching the book.
   But Schreiber was sued by the family of one of Kallinger's
victims under a so-called Son of Sam law in New Jersey that required
money owed to a criminal or his representatives as a result of his
crimes go to the victims.
   A judge ruled that the family was entitled not only to the 12.5
percent promised to Kallinger for his cooperation but also money
earned by Schreiber and her publisher.
   An appellate panel reversed the decision after publishers argued
it violated First Amendment freedoms.

<TEXT>
   For 12 years, Hank Oscar's toll-free
business telephone number was 1-800-243-2546, which meant little to
him. But to the Hyatt hotel chain, the number spelled out
1-800-CHECK-IN.
   That meant easy advertising for Hyatt and big bucks for Oscar.
   The Chicago-based Hyatt Corp. recently paid him $40,000 for
rights to the number.
   ``It felt like I won the lottery,'' said Oscar, owner of
Oscarvision Systems Inc.
   Oscar began using the toll-free number 12 years ago when he and
his wife, Marie, went into business supplying movie and slide
projectors to companies.
   ``We had a number assigned to us. We didn't choose it,'' said
Marie Oscar.
   Some other hotel chains also have easy-to-remember, toll-free
numbers.
   A spokesman for American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said AT&T has
no records on how often a company pays to get the rights to a
particular 800 number. Numbers are transferred through arrangements
between the parties, in which one releases the number at the same
time that the other requests it.
   ``AT&T doesn't sell 800 numbers. We loan them or assign them to
somebody,'' said company spokesman Pete Webster.
   Hyatt agreed to cover the cost of printing brochures with
Oscarvision's new number and to have its operators provide the
number to any caller who requests it during the next year.
   Hyatt operators began answering the Oscars' former toll-free
number this week. But because Hyatt has yet to begin promoting the
number, employees still answer that number by saying,
``Oscarvision.''

<TEXT>
   A Texas group headed by one of the
Bass brothers has bought 40 percent of the voting stock of the
parent company of the St. Petersburg Times, Florida's second-largest
newspaper.
   The Robert M. Bass Group purchased 200 of the 500 voting shares
in the Times Publishing Co., Andrew Barnes, the paper's president
and editor, said Thursday.
   The four Bass brothers of Fort Worth have holdings that Forbes
magazine valued at $6 billion before last year's stock market crash.
   ``It basically means nothing,'' said Barnes. He said the
transaction represents only 6 percent of the total 3,500 shares of
stock.
   ``It is a privately held company in which the majority wins,'' he
said, adding that as chief executive officer he controls the
majority. ``We have every intention of going on without missing a
beat.''
   Barnes, 49, added the title of chief executive officer to his
positions at the Times Publishing Co. on Monday upon the retirement
of Eugene Patterson, 65, after a decade at the helm.
   Patterson had been appointed by the late Nelson Poynter, the last
individual owner of the newspaper and founder of a non-profit
organization that trains journalists.
   The sale was completed Aug. 25, according to Merritt A. Gardner,
who represented the sellers, Anne Poynter Jamison Parker and Mary
Alice Jamison Griffin. He would not disclose the purchase price.
   The 104-year-old Times is a morning newspaper with a circulation
of more than 300,000 daily and 400,000 on Sunday.

   Eastern Airlines says it will contest a $1 million
fine imposed after federal agents found cocaine aboard one of its
jets for the second time in as many weeks.
   ``We have one of the most comprehensive programs in the industry
to intercept drugs,'' said spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak. ``We spend
three and a half million dollars a year.''
   The Customs Service on Monday found 68 pounds of cocaine aboard a
flight from Colombia hidden in a box of ground coffee in the baggage
compartment. On Thursday, the agency fined the airline but did not
impound the Boeing 727.
   ``Customs, at the present time, is not seizing the 727, since
Eastern appears to be making serious efforts to improve its security
measures against drug smuggling,'' said Customs spokesman Cliff
Stallings.
   Last week, Customs seized an Eastern L-1011 and fined the airline
$896,000 after finding 56 pounds of cocaine in a mail bag. Eastern
protested the seizure of the plane, saying its tip led to the
discovery of the drugs, but Customs denied that.
   The plane was released after Eastern posted bond for the value of
the fine.
   Ms. Ceremsak said that despite the recent seizures, Eastern has
no plans to discontinue service to Latin America and the Caribbean.
The Colombian national airline, Avianca, ended all cargo flights
after repeated drug seizures on its planes.

<HEAD>Texas Democrats Hope for Repeat of Kennedy-Johnson Feat</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 4th graf, Kennedy and, to CORRECT vote margin to 46,000,

   The Kennedy-Johnson bumper stickers have surfaced
after 28 years of dormancy as Democrats hope for a miracle on
Election Day similar to the one that gave them the White House in
1960.
   ``I hope we're not all fooling ourselves,'' said George
Christian, an Austin consultant who served as Lyndon Johnson's press
secretary.
   Fragments of statistics and a nostalgic history of unexpected
election outcomes keep Democratic hopes alive that vice presidential
candidate Lloyd Bentsen can deliver its 29 electoral votes for
running mate Michael Dukakis.
   Kennedy and Johnson won the state by only 46,000 votes, and in
1982, Democrat Mark White won the governorship over Republican Bill
Clements by six percentage points even though he was trailing in the
polls by the same margin the day before the election.
   ``I think we're gonna do it,'' says Bob Slagle, the Texas state
Democratic chairman.
   ``I think it's going to be a squeaker, very close, but we're
going to win it,'' insists Bentsen.
   Dukakis picked Bentsen as his running mate in hopes of repeating
the Kennedy-Johnson feat of 1960. But the immensely popular man from
McCook, Texas, has had trouble transferring some of his popularity
to the Massachusetts governor.
   Going into the final weekend of the campaign, the closest recent
poll puts the ticket seven points behind Republicans George Bush and
Dan Quayle, while others show a margin of more than 20 points.
   Democrats, who have never won the White House without winning
Texas, cling to the lowest number. They believe a strong
get-out-the-vote program can make up the difference, and cite
Bentsen's strong political organization in the state.
   ``This election isn't going to be won or lost now by Michael
Dukakis or Lloyd Bentsen. It's all in the turnout,'' said Ann
Richards, the Texas state treasurer.
   Tom Cosgrove, the Dukakis-Bentsen campaign chief in Texas, even
suggests that the opening of hunting season last weekend may help
the Democrats because some of the gun owners who oppose Dukakis may
be out hunting on Election Day.
   ``When you were looking at 15 points down, even nine or seven is
a big improvement,'' said Christian, who has been advising Bentsen
on the campaign.
   The dismal position of the Democratic campaign in Texas is a
reflection of the problems Dukakis has had nationwide.
   As elsewhere, Democrats had high hopes after their convention in
July of carrying Texas and bringing home the state's conservative
Democrats who helped give Ronald Reagan 64 percent of the vote in
1984.
   Early polls were encouraging, and the party dealt with peripheral
issues, such as Bentsen's dual candidacies for the U.S. Senate and
the vice presidency. He says he'll resign the former if he wins the
latter.
   The dual candidaciesvoters chosing to cast their
ballots twice for Texas with Bush, a former Houston congressman, and
Bentsen.
   ``I think it probably helped him in the vice presidential race,''
said Dick Leggitt, a Washington political consultant working for
Beau Boulter, Bentsen's Senate opponent.
   Dukakis then put non-Texan Cosgrove in charge, alienating many
locals.
   Soon after, Texas Democrats watched helplessly as the issues
picked by Bush for his broadsides against Dukakis _ flag-factory
patriotism, gun control and crime _ hit at the heart of the rural
Texas voters the Democrats wanted to win back.
   The charges went unanswered for many weeks. Too long, the
candidates now concede.
   Both Bentsen and Dukakis spent precious time in Texas, with the
senator spending about 40 days in the state since the convention.
   The campaign got a lift after Bentsen's debate with Quayle.
Grumbling among state Democrats, who had been getting more vocal in
criticizing the Boston-run Dukakis campaign, was replaced by a new
spirit of cooperation.
   But Dukakis' second debate with George Bush a week later was a
downer in Texas, as elsewere.
   The campaign in mid-October launched a full-scale ad campaign to
counter the Republicans, with Bentsen and Dukakis hammering Bush for
conducting a negative campaign. Heartened again, the Texas Democrats
seemed to pick up some vigor.
   But the Bush campaign continued its ads, and the issues lingered,
especially gun control, in which the Bush campaign had allies such
as the National Rifle Association to spread the word against Dukakis.
   And, with just more than a week left in the contest, Dukakis
acknowledged he was indeed a liberal and the Texas Democrats were on
the defensive again.
   ``It's not the best word in the world,'' said Slagle, who
insisted it wasn't that bad in the context of Harry Truman and John
Kennedy that Dukakis used it.
   But the Republicans were gleeful again.
   ``I don't know what his handlers were thinking,'' said Reggie
Basher, the Bush-Quayle campaign spokesman in Texas.

Classified Flight</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The five Atlantis astronauts poked a
little fun at the secrecy surrounding their upcoming classified
shuttle mission by donning Lone Ranger-style masks for reporters.
   ``We're probably going to get in all kinds of trouble for this,''
the mission commander, Robert ``Hoot'' Gibson, said with a laugh
Thursday.
   Atlantis, which sits on a launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center
in Cape Canaveral, Fla., is scheduled for liftoff late this month on
a mission during which it will send a spy satellite into orbit.
   On regular shuttle flights, the crews usually hold a news
conference and give individual interviews about a month before the
launch date.
   Details about the upcoming mission, however, are classified and
the exact launch time won't be given until nine minutes before
liftoff. The crew members also aren't allowed to discuss their
duties on the mission and were not giving interviews.
   But there were many interview requests for the second
post-Challenger mission, so the Air Force agreed to let the five
astronauts meet briefly with several reporters Thursday _ as long as
they said nothing about their mission.
   When they arrived, the five wore big smiles and black masks. NASA
employees at the Johnson Space Center's public information office
laughed and applauded their masked arrival.
   The masks, mission specialist William Shepherd said, were
included in a press kit given to the astronauts.
   Gibson added that the crew also received flash cards with joke
answers, including: ``Yes. No. I don't know. I can't tell you. I can
tell you, but I'd have to kill you.''
   The other Atlantis crewmen are pilot Guy Gardner and mission
specialists Richard ``Mike'' Mullane and Jerry Ross.

<BYLINE>Quayle's `Abortion Alternative' Medically Shaky, Experts Say
^By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dan Quayle's assertion that a surgical procedure
done immediately after a rape can prevent conception is probably
wrong, experts say.
   The procedure is called dilation and curettage, or D-and-C. It
involves scraping of the lining of the uterus. The procedure has a
variety of medical uses.
   The procedure, which Quayle described as an alternative to
abortion, may stop early development of an embryo, scientists said
Thursday, but conception itself can occur in less than an hour after
intercourse.
   Moreover, said Ruth Schwartz, a member of the health care
commission of the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists, a D-and-C is done in the uterus, while conception
occurs in the Fallopian tubes.
   ``It is not preventing a pregnancy from happening,'' Schwartz
said.
   Development of the embryo in rape victims is blocked through the
use of medications, which are preferable to the surgery, the experts
said.
   Doing the surgical procedure right after rape would be ``adding
great insult and injury on an already severely traumatized woman,''
Schwartz said. ``I think it would be a ridiculous notion to do as a
routine basis,'' she said.
   Surgical abortion removes an embryo after it has implanted itself
in the uterus wall, an event that occurs about a week after
conception. D-and-C can be used for first-trimester abortions,
although a suction procedure is more common.
   Quayle, who opposes abortion, brought up D-and-C when asked
Wednesday about abortion in the case of a rape.
   ``My position is that I understand from a medical situation that,
immediately after a rape, that is reported, that a woman normally,
in fact, can go to the hospital and have a D-and-C at that time,
that is before the actual forming of a life,'' he said.
   ``I understand that the medical procedure, a normal D-and-C,
right after rape, that you would not even get into a conception and
life would not even be formed,'' he said.
   W. LeRoy Heinrichs, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the
Stanford University Medical Center, said he knew of no evidence that
an immediate D-and-C would prevent conception.
   Perhaps there could be some effect on conception because of
anesthetic in the blood, or blood or other fluids pushed into the
Fallopian tubes, he suggested. But the whole idea is probably
incorrect, he said.
   Sperm reach the Fallopian tubes within minutes of intercourse and
can fertilize the egg in less than an hour if the woman has already
ovulated, Heinrichs said. Sperm can remain viable for 48 hours, so
they can also fertilize an egg if ovulation occurs within that
period after intercourse, he said.
   An immediate D-and-C would probably stop later embryonic
development by making the uterus wall resist implantation by the
embryo, Heinrichs said, adding he knows of no evidence for that idea.
   But women who have just been raped are generally given drugs
rather than surgery to block that implantation, Schwartz and
Heinrichs said. A D-and-C would be ``heavy-handed'' and probably not
work as well as the drugs, Heinrichs said.
   If a D-and-C done after implantation removes the embryo, it
amounts to a standard abortion, Schwartz and Heinrichs said.

<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said today that more than
90 percent of the nation's voters approved constitutional changes
designed to shift power away from the single political party that
has ruled for 26 years.
   The referendum was held Thursday, one month after anti-government
riots shook Algeria to its foundation.
   ``The Algerian people have chosen the road to reform,'' Interior
Minister Hedi Khediri said while announcing the results. ``The
Algerian people are as attached to freedom as to the building of
their country _ in unity.''
   The ministry said 92.27 percent of those voting in the referendum
said ``yes'' to changes promised by President Chadli Bendjedid.
   The referendum shifted some power from the president to the
premier. It also made the premier responsible to the National
Assembly, or parliament, so daily governmental operations could be
removed from direct control of the National Liberation Front, the
only legal party.
   Bendjedid has suggested independent candidates be allowed to run
for seats in the National Assembly. Until now the Front had to
approve all candidates.
   Kamel Belkacem, publisher of the pro-reform weekly newspaper
Algerie Actualite, said Bendjedid's ultimate goal is to open the
country to free, multiparty elections.
   The large vote in support of Bendjedid's reforms gives him a
strong mandate to push through other changes he hopes to make when
the party holds its congress at the end of the month.
   The front led the fight against French colonial rule. Since
independence in 1962, it has controlled the country's political,
economic, social, cultural and judicial life.
   About 26 million people live in Algeria, a country roughly three
times the size of Texas.
   The Interior Ministry said 83.08 percent of the country's 12
million voters cast ballots. The ministry said 9.3 million voted in
favor of the proposals to modify 14 articles of the constitution.
   The president was expected to appoint a new government in the
next 10 days, according to Western diplomats and Algerian sources
close to the government, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The sources said the composition of the next government will be a
test of the president's sincerity in initiating genuine reforms.
   ``They are having trouble finding people with experience to serve
as ministers who are not contaminated by association with previous
governments,'' one diplomat said.
   Algerians took to the streets Oct. 4 to protest shortages of food
and jobs and a declining standard of living, blamed on the
plummeting price of oil, Algeria's chief source of export earnings.
   The Interior Ministry says 176 people, mostly young men, were
killed in the six days of violence that rocked Algiers and a number
of provincial towns.
   The first task of the new government will be to deal with the
crisis that spawned the riots, instituting reforms expected to
include decentralizing control of the economy and privatizing most
non-strategic industries, diplomatic sources said.
   Khediri said the nation's ``economic problems can be attacked by
a program of austerity.'' Austerity measures taken earlier by the
government inspired the October riots.
   Algeria has a $20 billion foreign debt. Revenue from oil exports
has fallen 40 percent since 1981.
   The naming of the new government will be followed by a party
congress Nov. 27 which will consider a series of further reforms
that could redefine the party's role, Algerian and Western
diplomatic sources said.

   City commissioners have rejected a proposal allowing
police to arrest homeless people, jail them for 10 days and fine
them up to $100.
   ``We're catching hell for it,'' Commissioner J.L. Plummer said of
the proposal, which was unanimously rejected Thursday but will be
reconsidered Dec. 15. ``We have existing laws that can be enforced.''
   The ordinance, aimed at curbing the annual influx of homeless
from Northern cities, would have banned sleeping on sidewalks and
cooking and urinating in streets and parks.
   After rejecting the measure, the five commissioners requested a
less harsh revision and promised to appoint a task force to help
street people. The revision should not call for the arrest of
homeless people, officials said.
   ``That's out,'' Mayor Xavier Suarez said. ``It actually can be
viewed as an attempt to harass the homeless.''
   The proposed ordinance had caused an uproar among advocates for
the homeless. Critics said the city was trying to clean up the
streets near the Miami Arena before the city's new NBA team debuts
there Saturday.
   The Arena is a few blocks from the city's overflowing shelter for
the homeless, whose director, Brother Paul Johnson, applauded the
commission decision.
   ``I think the idea that Miami could stop homelessness by a law
that arrests them is ridiculous,'' Johnson said. ``I think everyone
realized this morning that that cannot be done.''
   The ordinance was proposed by the Police Department. Police said
it was prompted by complaints from businessmen.
   Suarez said that despite its rejection, the ordinance had a
beneficial effect. ``The reaction to it has actually helped the
commission look at the problem of the homeless,'' he said.

   Thousands of starving cattle found along
with more than 60 carcasses at a northern Texas ranch had been moved
there because of the drought and probably had not been fed since
July, authorities said.
   ``Their ribs were showing. A lot of them were completely down.
Some can't even see _ they're starved so much that they're blind,''
said Kaufman County Sheriff Robert Harris. He called it the worst
case of animal cruelty he had ever seen.
   The discovery of the malnourished Santa Gertrudis cattle
Wednesday has prompted a search for the person responsible for their
condition.
   ``It isn't something that happened overnight,'' Harris said.
``I'd say they haven't been fed since they've been up here'' in
July. ``This has been progressing.''
   The King Ranch in southern Texas owned the estimated 3,000
cattle, but they had been under the care of a Dallas man, Harris
said.
   The cattle ended up in Forney because of the drought in southern
Texas, said Ken York, who operates the American Livestock Management
Co. of Marshall.
   The person responsible for taking care of the cattle never
notified the King Ranch of trouble when northern Texas also was
stricken by drought, York said.
   ``The reports kept coming in and every indication was that things
were OK,'' he said.
   Feed has been brought to the site and Harris said authorities
would care for them.
   Some cattle were so malnourished they could not walk, and feed
had to be put in front of them.
   ``They're high-bred cattle,' Harris said. ``They're Santa
Gertrudis, they're not just scrub cattle.'' In the 1920s and 1930s,
the King Ranch crossed Shorthorns and Brahmans to develop the Santa
Gertrudis.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. unemployment rate fell to 5.3 percent in October, the
government said today in its last major economic report before
Tuesday's election.
   The decline from September's 5.4 percent returned the rate to
June's 5.3 percent, the lowest since May 1974.
   The Labor Department said employers added 325,000 jobs last
month, compared with average monthly increases of 240,000 in August
and September.
   Nearly 100,000 of the new jobs were on assembly lines, more than
double the drop of 45,000 manufacturing jobs over the two previous
months, the department said.
   On Thursday, retailers and automakers reported improved October
sales over a year ago, when the 1987 stock crash was sending tremors
through the buying public.
   The sales reports had little effect on the financial markets, but
stocks and bonds were helped by a steadying of the dollar against
major foreign currencies.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 13.51 points to
2,170.34 on Thursday, while advancing issues outnumbered declines 4
to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Bond prices also rose. The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond
rose { point, or about $5 per $1,000 face amount, while its yield
fell to 8.74 percent from 8.78 percent late Wednesday.
   In addition to the dollar's steadiness, the bond market was
helped by a decline in precious metals prices and a perception that
the retail and auto sales were fairly weak. Bond traders fear the
inflation that often accompanies strong sales, which can be a sign
of a strong economy.
   But the pace of bond trading was restrained as many investors
stayed out of the market in advance of today's scheduled government
report on U.S. unemployment during October.
   The dollar's leveling followed several days of decline. In New
York, the dollar rose to 124.68 Japanese yen Thursday from 124.40
yen the day before.
   Stocks have come under some pressure from the dollar's persistent
decline in recent days, which has raised fears that the Federal
Reserve could bolster the currency by nudging interest rates higher.
   U.S. automakers said they sold 7.9 percent more cars and light
trucks in late October this year compared with the same period last
year, when the initial impact of the stock market crash was being
felt.
   Analysts said the retail sales report indicated continued
sluggishness, though some predicted a healthy Christmas season.
   ``There was some gradual improvement in the pace of sales from
August and September with particular strength noted in some of the
apparel categories,'' said Jeffrey Feiner, a retail industry analyst
with the investment firm Merrill Lynch & Co.
   But Jeffrey Edelman, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
said, ``The numbers were a little below expectations.''

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of leftists burned an
American flag outside the U.S. Embassy today to condemn the recent
agreement extending U.S. bases in the country and demand the
government refuse to negotiate a new treaty in 1991.
   Protesters, representing several labor and student groups,
carried banners reading ``No to U.S. Bases'' and ``U.S. Imperialism
_ Cause of Poverty.''
   Police estimated the crowd at 1,000. But reporters said the
numbers dwindled in half as rain fell. The group dispersed without
incident at the end of the protest.
   ``Dismantle U.S. bases in the country now,'' Crispin Beltran,
leader of the left-wing May First Movement, told the crowd. ``We
condemn the talks. ... This is an historic sellout of Philippine
sovereignty.''
   Beltran was referring to a U.S.-Philippine agreement Oct. 17 that
reaffirmed the presence of the six bases in this country until
September 1991.
   The United States agreed to provide $962 million in economic and
military aid over the final two years of the agreement. Previously,
Washington paid $180 million a year for use of Clark Air Base, Subic
Bay naval base and four smaller installations.
   After 1991, any extension of the bases must be under a formal
treaty ratified by two-thirds of the 23-member senate, where
opposition to the installations is strong.
   Under the agreement, either the Philippines or the United States
can unilaterally terminate the agreement after Sept. 16, 1991, with
one year's notice. That could extend the bases until September 1992.
   President Corazon Aquino, however, said this week the Philippines
considers the agreement void on Sept. 16, 1991, unless the treaty
has been ratified.
   Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
United States also wanted negotiations completed and a treaty
ratified before the September 1991 date.

   A pregnant woman has died in a rare case of
pig-to-human transmission of swine flu, according to the Centers for
Disease Control.
   The 32-year-old Wisconsin woman had visited a pig barn at a
county fair that had been the site of a flu-like illness in the
animals, the CDC reported Thursday.
   She fell ill days later, and although she gave birth to a healthy
baby on Sept. 17, she died on Sept. 21. Under CDC policy, neither
the woman nor the site of the infection was released.
   CDC researcher Nancy Arden said there has been no indication of
further spread in the Wisconsin case.

   President Reagan today hailed October's decline
in the unemployment rate as ``very, very good news for all
Americans.''
   Reagan's comments came as he prepared to leave for a campaign
swing in behalf of Republican presidential candidate George Bush.
   Minutes earlier, the Labor Department announced that the nation's
civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.3 percent in October from 5.4
percent a month earlier. The October unemployment rate matched's
June's as the lowest since May 1974.
   ``The future is bright and its getting brighter because we've
been bringing good jobs and hope and opportunity to all the citizens
in this country,'' Reagan said.
   ``America is hard at work and growing. I believe George Bush is
going to be the next president because, as every day passes, it
becomes ever clearer that our policies have worked, are working and
will continue to work. Nothing's going to stop us now,'' Reagan said.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud
bloc appeared to be in the best position to form a new government
after the final vote count was announced today in Israel's
parliamentary elections.
   The count released by the Central Elections Committee indicated
Likud won 40 seats in the 120-member Knesset, or parliament, and the
left-leaning Labor Party won 39 seats, spokeswoman Sarah Yitzhaki
said.
   The result of Tuesday's vote means neither party has the majority
needed to form a government and both parties have been wooing the
right-wing religious bloc in an effort to gain control of the
Knesset.
   The National Religious Party, which has five seats in the
Knesset, has pledged its support to Likud, Israeli radio said.
   Shamir held bargaining meetings Thursday with two other
right-wing religious parties, Moledet (Homeland) and Tzomet
(Crossroads), whose support he needs.
   Tzomet and Moledet, which won two seats each, favor annexing the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Moledet's founder,
retired Gen. Rehavam Zeevi, also favors the expulsion of all Arabs
from Israel.
   Shamir said he would allow more Jewish settlements to be built in
the disputed lands but rejected the potential coalition partners'
demands for annexation and expulsion of the Palestinian residents.
   Zeevi has asked Likud to hold a referendum on the annexation
issue as a precondition for his joining a Shamir-led coalition,
Israel radio said.
   A Likud Cabinet minister raised the prospect that the Labor Party
might be invited to join in a government because the religious
parties that hold the balance of power were pressing too hard for
Orthodox causes.
   Labor and Likud now share power in a contentious coalition
government.
   ``The religious parties are presenting many demands and difficult
conditions. We will not be able to respond to them all,'' Moshe
Katzav, welfare and labor minister, told the newspaper Hadashot.
   The religious parties have asked to ban driving, movies and
soccer on the Jewish Sabbath and are demanding that conversion to
Judaism be recognized only if it is performed by an Orthodox rabbi.
   Israeli newspapers have said that the ascension of Orthodox
legislators worried Israel's non-religious Jews.
   The daily Maariv carried a poll that showed 60 percent of
Israelis were concerned about the rising power of the Orthodox. The
poll also indicated, however, that 65 opposed a ``unity government''
of Labor and Likud such as has governed since 1984 following an
inconclusive election.
   The liberal daily Haaretz, meanwhile, quoted sources in Shamir's
office as saying the prime minister was seeking the ouster of Labor
leader Shimon Peres as a price for forming a unity government with
the opposition party.
   Labor party officials who demanded anonymity said a rebellion
against Peres was brewing within his party's ranks after Labor's
poor showing.
   However, Likud minister Katzav said Peres could be invited to
join the government if he dropped his endorsement of Arab calls for
an international peace conference on the Middle East.
   Seats won by other right-wing parties in the election were:
Tehiya, 3; Tzomet, 2 and Moledet, 2.
   Seats won by leftist parties: Shinui, 2; Mapam, 3 and and
Citizens' Rights Movement, 5.
   Seats won by the religious parties: Shas, 6; Torah Flag, 2;
Agudat Israel, 5 and National Religious Party, 5.
   Seats won by Arab-oriented parties: Communists, 4; Progressive
List for Peace, 1 and Arab Democratic Party, 1.
   In another development, the pro-PLO newspaper Al Fajr today
published a draft declaration of independence for a Palestinian
state, which called for founding a state on the basis of U.N.
Security Council resolution 181 of 1947. The U.N. resolution is an
implicit recognition of Israel because it calls for both an Arab and
a Jewish state.
   On Thursday, 11 Palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes
with soldiers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Arab hospital
officials said. The nearly 11-month-old uprising against Israeli
control of the lands has claimed the lives of 306 Palestinians and
10 Israelis.

<HEAD>Bakker, Top Associates Notified They Are Grand Jury Targets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors examining PTL's finances have
notified Jim Bakker and several former associates they are targets
of a grand jury investigation, an indication indictments may be
imminent, a newspaper reported today.
   ``A target of the grand jury investigation is a person as to whom
the prosecutor or the grand jury has substantial evidence linking
him to the commission of a crime and who, in the judgment of the
prosecutor, is a putative defendant,'' federal prosecutor Charles
Alexander wrote, The Charlotte Observer reported.
   The newspaper said Bakker, PTL chief builder Roe Messner; and
Richard Dortch, Bakker's former top deputy, received the letter. All
three have been invited to testify before the grand jury the week of
Nov. 28.
   Alexander's Oct. 24 letter to Bakker cites Justice Department
guidelines in inviting Bakker to testify, including a requirement he
give up his right against self-incrimination and consent to a full
examination under oath.
   ``Any and all testimony which you provide can be used against you
by the grand jury and in subsequent legal proceedings. ... This
letter is not a subpoena, and you are not compelled to appear,'' the
newspaper quoted the letter as saying.
   Alexander has refused even to acknowledge the grand jury's
existence. He declined comment Thursday.
   Bakker said in a statement that he would not appear before the
grand jury.
   Bakker resigned from PTL in March 1987 in a sex-and-money
scandal. The grand jury has been investigating the evangelical
empire for possible mail and wire fraud, conspiracy and tax
violations since August 1987.
   Bakker has denied any wrongdoing and said in August that if he is
indicted, ``it'll be because somebody framed us and set us up.''
   Bakker attorney Jim Toms said that despite the target letter, he
doesn't think prosecutors have decided to indict Bakker. Toms said
he hopes to meet with prosecutors ``to reach a just and equitable
solution to this distressing situation.''
   ``I do sense they are to the point where they know pretty well
where they want to head,'' Toms said, ``and it's time to open a
dialogue.''
   Bill Diehl, who represents Dortch, said the letter is a clear
signal prosecutors are going to indict the targets. ``It's a done
deal,'' he said.
   Former federal prosecutor Kenneth Andresen, who represents
Bakker's former secretary, agreed. He noted the investigation has
gone on for 16 months.
   ``If prosecutors don't think they've uncovered evidence of
wrongdoing, there's no need to give the targets an opportunity to
explain their conduct,'' he said.

   When Mayor Ken Cleveland discovered his
Lincoln Continental had been stolen, he knew exactly how to contact
the thieves.
   He dialed his car phone.
   ``I called it and they answered it. They're so dumb,'' he said.
``It was a guy who answered. He said, `Hello,' and I said, `How you
doing?'
   ``Then he said, `OK,' and hung up.''
   The mayor's TV set, a camera, boxes of fireworks and cases of
beer and wine were also stolen, taken by intruders who entered while
he, his wife and their guests slept, Cleveland said. He discovered
the theft Thursday morning.
   ``I'm just glad no one got hurt,'' he said.

   President Reagan today paused on the campaign
trail to approve legislation providing for U.S. participation in an
anti-genocide treaty signed by Harry Truman in 1948 but long blocked
by conservatives.
   ``I am delighted to fulfill the promise made by Harry Truman to
all the peoples of the world _ and especially the Jewish people,''
Reagan said in a statement released at the White House in advance of
his action.
   Reagan recalled the Nazi death camps that claimed millions of
Jews, Slavs, Gypsies and others in World War II, and noted that
similar horrors have occurred in Cambodia, the Ukraine and Ethiopia.
   These events ``only renew our rage and righteous fury and make
this moment all the more significant for me and all Americans,''
Reagan said.
   The president signed the bill at O'Hare International Airport
outside Chicago while on his way to a rally for Vice President Bush
and his running mate, Dan Quayle.

   As he left the White House, Reagan was asked about criticiam that
the GOP has engaged in a negative campaign.
   ``It's a little bit like what Harry Truman once said, `We've just
been telling the truth, and they think it's negative,''' he replied.
   Bush ``is the guy to lead us forward,'' Reagan said in remarks
prepared for delivery in Palos Hills, Ill, where he was speaking at
a Bush rally.
   Reagan said that ``the last eight years have been good years, but
I've got a hunch that, when George Bush gets in the saddle ... we
ain't seen nothing yet.''
   ``I know the fellow at the top of the other ticket is going
around saying he's on your side. Well, I know who's on your side
because he's been on my side _ it's George Bush. ... So, if you want
to know who's on the side of the little guy, well, I'll tell you _
it's the big guy, the big guy from Texas,'' Reagan said in a
referenc to Bush.
   ``And, as for the other fellow _ he's been going around lately
comparing himself with some of the great Democrats of the past, men
like FDR and JFK, but I have to tell you, if he's Harry Truman, I'm
Roger Rabbit,'' Reagan went on.

   After the rally at Moraine Valley Community College, Reagan was
traveling to New Jersey for a Republican Party fund-raiser in
Voorhees Township.
   The genocide treaty was ratified by the Senate in 1986, handing a
personal triumph to Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., who made than
3,000 Senate speeches over 19 years urging ratification. Proxmire is
retiring from the Senate this year.
   After the ratification, implementing legislation was still needed
to give the treaty the force of American law. It is this
legislation, passed by the Senate Oct. 14, that Reagan agreed to
sign.
   Like the treaty itself, the legislation was opposed by many
conservatives. It makes genocide a crime under U.S. law and imposes
life imprisonment as the maximum punishment. Genocide is defined in
the treaty as the intentional destruction of national, ethnic,
racial or religious groups, in whole or in part.
   On Saturday, Reagan travels to the Detroit area for a Bush-Quayle
rally at Macomb Community College and to Mesquite, Texas, near
Dallas, for a GOP gathering in a rodeo arena.
   After that, his plans were uncertain, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said.
   Fitzwater at first said Reagan would return from Texas to
Washington and spend Sunday at the White House, possibly going out
for another one-day pre-election foray on Monday.
   Late Thursday, the president's spokesman said that was still
under consideration, but officials also were looking at the
possibility of Reagan flying on from Dallas to California, a crucial
state with 47 electoral votes, and returning to Washington on
election eve.
   ``No place is sealed up,'' Fitzwater said. ``We're running like
we're 10 points behind, going every place.''
   Reagan has made seven campaign appearances in California since
Bush became the Republican nominee for president.
   He spoke in Long Beach and Irvine Aug. 23, in Thousand Oaks and
Santa Barbara Aug. 27, in San Diego Oct. 27 and in Fullerton and San
Bernardino on Wednesday.
   Fitzwater said Reagan would watch election returns at the White
House on Tuesday night. Asked whether the president would make any
public appearances or statements, he said, ``At this point, we just
don't have his plans available.''
   He said he did not believe Reagan would deliver a television
speech on Bush's behalf before the election.

   '
   WASHINGTON (AP) _ ``Love Me Tender'' dolls are being recalled
because the plastic eyes could come off and pose a threat of choking
children, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
   Tonka Products launched the recall after receiving 76 reports
from consumers about cases in which the eyes had come off the dolls.
No injuries were reported in any of the cases, the company said.
   More than 100,000 dolls, model numbers 8900 and 8901, have been
sold nationwide since July 1987. They cost between $18 and $30.
   Parents were urged to take the dolls away from young children and
return them to the place of purchase or to Tonka for a refund. The
address to mail back the dolls is Tonka Products, Attention
Department K, 2950 Robertson Ave., Cincinnati, Ohio, 45209.
   Those needing more information can contact the company at
1-800-548-7262 or the safety commission at 1-800-638-2772.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An opposition legislator resigned from parliament
today because of a growing insider trading scandal. His action put
pressure on members of the governing Liberal Democratic Party who
are tied to the affair.
   They include Japan's Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.
   ``I accept responsibility, resign from my parliamentary seat and
apologize deeply to the people,'' said Takumi Ueda of the Japan
Socialist Party. ``I cannot allow my name to be used by some people
to hinder our party's battle to reveal the entire scandal.''
   Ueda, who like other lawmakers blames the stock transactions on
an aide, is the first legislator to resign because of the scandal.
   Dozens of prominent people reportedly were offered bargain-priced
shares of Recruit-Cosmos, a real estate firm, before the stocks were
traded publicly. The stocks quickly rose in value after trading
began and inside purchasers made as much as $960,000. The government
says that was legal. But opposition parties say the practice is
unethical.
   Ueda's resignation is likely to increase pressure on leaders of
the governing Liberal Democratic Party linked to the affair,
including Takeshita, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and former
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone. All have acknowledged aides bought
the stock in their names. But they deny direct personal involvement.
   Political analysts doubt that prominent Liberal Democratic Party
politicians will step down. But they say Ueda's resignation will put
pressure on them to clarify the degree of their involvement and
stoke public criticism.
   Since the scandal surfaced in July, parliamentary debate over a
key tax reforms pushed by the governing party has been paralyzed by
resistance from opposition parties.

<TEXT>
   A former firefighter has been indicted on
charges he set 14 fires that terrorized the town of Jefferson for
months.
   A Coos County grand jury Thursday charged Lance Lalumiere, 23, of
Jefferson, with 14 counts of arson and two of attempted arson.
   The rash of fires, which began in brush and fields and progressed
to barns and homes, had terrorized the community of 850 since May.
No serious injuries were reported, although one family narrowly
escaped their burning home May 27.
   Lalumiere was working as a dishwasher in Jefferson at the time of
his arrest Oct. 12 on charges he set fire to his brother's cabin
Aug. 23. Police said at the time they would seek indictments against
him for 15 other fires.
   The attorney general's office said Lalumiere had admitted to
setting 16 blazes.
   Court documents show that authorities found a hand-drawn map of
several arson sites in Lalumiere's trailer and a propane-type torch
in a car he owned.
   The documents also indicate that on the day of the fire at his
brother's cabin, police used dogs to track Lalumiere's scent on a
path from the cabin to his trailer. Lance reportedly said he had not
used the path since 1987.
   He remained jailed without bail.

   Opponents of a measure that would make English the
state's official language won support from the U.S. Justice
Department in their effort to persuade a federal court to remove the
measure from Tuesday's ballot.
   A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on
Thursday heard arguments and said it probably would rule before the
vote on Amendment 11.
   The Justice Department argued that the petition drive that put
the measure on the ballot violated the Voting Rights Act by not
distributing petitions in Spanish as well as English in six heavily
Hispanic counties.
   At Thursday's hearing, Mark Dienstag, attorney for the group
Florida English, which collected more than 500,000 signatures,
attacked the government's position.
   ``The Justice Department brief is incompetent and misleading,''
Dienstag said. ``(They) chose to ignore all the cases we're talking
about which created the body of law surrounding the Voting Rights
Act.''
   Following the hearing, Don Middlebrooks, attorney for Speak Up
Now, which challenged the ballot measure, said the Justice
Department decision could be a boost.
   ``Generally courts give some deference to the agency responsible
for enforcing the act, and that's the Justice Department,''
Middlebrooks said.

<TEXT>
   To cheers of support from thousands of
workers, Margaret Thatcher and Solidarity leader Lech Walesa laid a
wreath today outside the Lenin Shipyard to honor Poles slain during
1970 riots.
   Shipyard workers in hard hats, their hands raised in
V-for-victory salutes, chanted ``Solidarity! Solidarity!'' as the
British prime minister and Walesa placed the flowers at a towering
monument near the shipyard.
   The monument honors dozens of Polish workers who died when
security forces opened fire to quell riots over food prices.
   Mrs. Thatcher is the first Western leader to meet Walesa at the
shipyard, where Solidarity began eight years ago.
   Polish media have been giving heavy coverage to Mrs. Thatcher's
visit but have been omitting references to her ``private program'' _
the code for her visits with Solidarity supporters.
   However, newspapers today did print the full text of her rather
sharply worded dinner speech Thursday calling for dialogue with
Solidarity.
   A crowd estimated at 20,000 thronged the square around the
monument and shouted, ``Down with communism!'' and ``Out with
Rakowski!'' Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski has ordered the
shipyard closed for financial reasons.
   ``Mrs. Thatcher Don't Let the Shipyard be Closed,'' read one sign.
   ``See how many have come despite their efforts to stop them? They
have filtered through somehow,'' Walesa told reporters. ``We will
not be defeated. This is a monument of hope.''
   Mrs. Thatcher periodically disappeared into the crowd. There was
no sign of communist government officials nor of Polish security
police who have followed her throughout most of her three-day visit.
   The trip to the shipyard, which the government plans to close
Dec. 1, was the high point of Mrs. Thatcher's visit, which ended
today. The British leader has publicly endorsed the banned
Solidarity trade union federation.
   After the wreath-laying, Mrs. Thatcher visited St. Brygida's
church, where she had lunch in the rectory with Solidarity leaders.
   Mrs. Thatcher thanked the crowd for its reception. ``I had to
come here and see for myself the spirit of the Polish people,'' she
said.
   After meeting with Mrs. Thatcher, Walesa said, ``I am very
satisfied. We discussed all the problems that the prime minister
wanted to hear about and we wanted to raise.''
   Earlier, crowds lined the British leader's route, pressing
flowers into her hands while she toured the Old Town and Gdansk's
reconstructed Long Market, whose ornate architecture reflects the
city's wealthy past at the major Baltic seaport of the 16th century.
   Mrs. Thatcher was greeted by city authorities when she arrived by
plane from Warsaw. She then departed for a ceremony where she joined
the country's leader, Wojciech Jaruzelski, to honor Polish defenders
of the Westerplatte penisula, scene of the first shots of World War
II.
   She dedicated a monument in the city's eastern Praga district to
British flyers who died trying to ferry food and weapons to the
Polish-resistance movement in the failed Warsaw Uprising of 1944.
The rebellion against the Nazi occupiers cost 200,000 Polish lives.
   On Thursday evening, Mrs. Thatcher told communist leaders they
must negotiate with Solidarity as the price for long-term Western
aid, including the rescheduling of a $39 billion foreign debt.
   Solidarity leaders today praised her for that.
   ``It was beautiful what she said,'' senior Solidarity adviser
Bronislaw Geremek said in an interview. ``For this speech, Mrs.
Thatcher gets a great deal of thanks from us.''
   Mrs. Thatcher said it was ``vital there should be a real dialogue
with representatives of all sections of society, including
Solidarity.''
   ``You will find your friends ready, not just to stand and cheer,
but to help in practical ways,'' she said.
   Gen. Jaruzelski, in a guarded speech, complained Poland
``suffered much'' from Western embargoes after the government's 1981
declaration of martial law and outlawing the following year of
Solidarity.
   He hinted he resented carping from wealthy Western countries that
have not shared the long history of foreign invasions and economic
straits endured by Poland.

<HEAD>Norway Confirms Diversion of Heavy Water to India</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fifteen tons of heavy water that could be
used to make nuclear weapons were illegally diverted to India,
authorities said today. They fear India may have used the material
in a secret weapons program.
   India did not sign the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and
is known to have tested nuclear devices. The Indian government,
however, has denied that it operates a nuclear arms program.
   Tor Axel Busch, Norway's deputy public director of prosecutions,
today confirmed reports that heavy water was flown from Norway to
Basel, Switzerland, where it was rerouted via Dubai to Bombay,
India. The reports were published last summer in the Oslo newspaper
Verdens Gang.
   A West German firm bought the heavy water in 1982 for scientific
use in West Germany. It denies any diversion.
   The New York Times reported in today's editions that the
Norwegian heavy water, while en route to India, was combined with a
shipment of 6.7 tons of Soviet heavy water purchased by the same
broker.
   Busch was away from his office in northern Norway today and not
available for comment. But his office relayed a statement to The
Associated Press in which said he has heard unconfirmed reports of
the Soviet shipment but that he knows nothing about it.
   The Norwegian company, Norsk Hydro, sells the heavy water for use
as a coolant in nuclear power reactors and for scientific research.
   However, it can also be used in the chemical process that turns
uranium into plutonium, a component of nuclear weapons.
   Norwegian officials say they are trying to find out who took
delivery of the heavy water in Bombay and what it was used for.
   Norway is also negotiating with Israel to determine how 20 tons
of heavy water exported there in 1959 and 1960 have been used.
Israel also has not signed the non-proliferation treaty.
   Two other countries, Pakistan and South Africa, failed to sign
and are also suspected of possessing atomic weapons.

   Union members at Walt Disney World
have overwhelmingly rejected a three-year contract covering 9,000
employees.
   ``This has never happened, not in 17 years,'' said Harvey Totzke,
president of the six-union Service Trades Council, whose negotiators
had recommended approval.
   The pact was defeated 1,558 to 96 on Thursday. Negotiators were
to return to the bargaining table today. The old contract has been
extended until midnight Monday.
   The union council includes food servers, custodians, store
clerks, stagehands, bus drivers, monorail and watercraft pilots,
meat cutters and those who portray the Disney characters at the
amusement park.
   The agreement would have provided for a 5 percent raise in its
first year and 4 percent increases in each of its last two years.
   Union leaders said many members wanted bigger raises.

<TEXT>
   DAYTON, Ohio AP) _ A mysterious substance is eating away at the
clothing and furniture at a house, investigators say.
   Firefighters who entered the home of Ethel Black on Thursday
reported throat irritation and a burning sensation on their skin,
but the four occupants, who noticed the phenomenon Saturday,
apparently suffered no ill effects.
   Lt. Bruce DeVelbiss of the Montgomery County Hazardous Materials
Team picked up a pair of jeans to reveal a tear in the legs. Using
his finger like a knife, he easily sliced through the material.
   ``All the fabric in the house is like that,'' he said. ``I've
never seen anything like it in my 14 years here.''
   ``The odor smells acidic and leaves a metallic taste in your
mouth,'' said District Fire Chief Jerry Dyer. But he said tests
showed the house to have a high alkaline concentration, not acid.
   Dyer said that he is trying to locate an air sampler and that the
clothing would be analyzed by laboratories. ``We will strongly
suggest to the occupants that they don't return until someone can
come with a finding on what it is,'' he said.
   Firefighters checked neighboring houses but found no other
evidence of contamination.

   An elderly couple claims objects flew
mysteriously around their home at night and asked police to
investigate.
   The French news agency Agence France-Presse quoted police sources
as saying a doctor examined the woman and determined she was
mentally disturbed. The sources, who were not identified, said they
had no plans to pursue the case.
   ``We've lived here for 50 years and nothing like this ever
happened before,'' 76-year-old Raoul Fournier told reporters
Thursday.
   Fournier said dishes, jars of jelly and other items flew around a
room on the ground floor of the house from 11 p.m. Tuesday until 4
a.m. Wednesday.
   ``It's unimaginable what happened,'' he said. ``Trinkets, dishes
and even our holy candle brought back from Lourdes flew around at
high speed and crashed against the walls.''
   He said his wife Angele, 73, was still shocked by the experience
and did not want to talk about the events. ``Someone cast a spell on
my wife,'' he said. ``But we don't have any enemies.''
   AFP quoted the police sources as saying the man did not see the
events themselves but was old about them by his wife.

   Federal prosecutors have indicated that defense
consultant William Parkin will be among the first people charged in
the massive Pentagon bribery case, a source says.
   The source, speaking Thursday on condition of anonymity, said
Parkin has been told he ``will be indicted unless he comes in and
cuts a deal, which he is not going to do.''
   Parkin has told reporters that he believes he broke no laws in
running his Alexandria, Va., consulting business. Although the
source would not reveal details of the plea bargain offer, he said
the terms were stiff.
   Last week, Henry E. Hudson, the U.S. attorney in Alexandria, Va.,
said the first indictments in the investigation into the
$150-billion-a-year defense procurement business could come later
this month.
   The 2-year-old investigation centers on allegations that
consultants paid bribes to Defense Department officials to gather
inside information that was useful to companies bidding on the
multimillion-dollar projects.
   Sharon Dibbley, a spokeswoman for Hudson, said the prosecutor
would not comment on reports that plea-bargain arrangements had been
offered. Earlier, however, government and defense sources indicated
that Hudson's assistants had been kept waiting for responses from
some potential defendants to offers of plea bargains.
   Prosecutors are known to be looking at a broad variety of charges
in the investigation, including bribery, fraud, conspiracy, theft of
government property and tax violations.
   Hudson is running the bribery investigation that came to light in
June when FBI agents staged raids at more than 40 locations around
the country. Justice Department officials who spoke on condition of
anonymity predicted that about a half dozen people will be indicted
initially by a grand jury. Hudson said indictments could continue
over a year.
   Attempts to reach Parkin for comment were unsuccessful. No one
answered his telephone on two occasions, and his lawyer, Gerard
Treanor, declined to comment.
   In interviews with The Wall Street Journal last summer, Parkin
said he paid Fred Lackner, a California-based consultant, more than
$15,000 to obtain inside information on a Navy contract for
anti-aircraft equipment.
   Lackner said he received some information from Stuart Berlin, a
Navy engineer, but he said the information was public knowledge.
   The Journal, quoting unnamed sources, reported Thursday that
prosecutors also would seek an indictment against Lackner, who could
not be reached for comment. Lackner also was offered a plea
bargaining deal, the paper said.
   Lackner's attorney, William Dougherty, was out of the country and
was unavailable for comment.
   Parkin has told reporters that he and Lackner shared consulting
fees from Teledyne Electronics of Newbury Park, Calif.
   One source familiar with the case has said the Teledyne aspects
were the furthest along in the investigation.
   This source, speaking anonymously, also said Jack Sherman, a
Marine Corps official, was believed to have reached or be near
reaching a plea bargain with prosecutors.
   The Journal's sources said prosecutors have evidence that Sherman
accepted more than $40,000 in cash from defense consultants and
their associates in a one-year period. Sherman's lawyer, Louis
Koutoulakos, did not return telephone messages.
   In a related development, the Defense Contract Audit Agency has
found the Pentagon's procurement regulations are so vague that major
defense contractors have been allowed to bill the government for
millions of dollars for outside consultants without justifying or
explaining their work.
   In a review of 12 of the top 100 defense contractors, the
auditors labeled as ``questionable'' claims for $43 million out of
the $236.5 million they charged to the government over the past year
for consultant services.

   The nation's civilian unemployment rate fell to
5.3 percent in October as the economy created more than 300,000
jobs, the government said today in its last major economic report
before Tuesday's presidential election.
   The 0.1 percentage point drop in the rate from September's 5.4
percent matched June's rate as the lowest since May 1974.
   President Reagan, leaving the White House to campaign for George
Bush, said the report was ``very, very good news for all Americans''
   ``The future is bright and its getting brighter. ... Nothing's
going to stop us now.''
   Employers added 325,000 jobs last month, more than the average
monthly increases of 240,000 in August and September but comparable
to last spring's gains of 300,000 a month.
   Nearly 100,000 of October's new jobs were on assembly lines, more
than double the drop of 45,000 manufacturing jobs over the two
previous months.
   The figures sent both bond and stock prices down in early trading
as investors gave up hopes that the Federal Reserve Board would move
to reduce interest rates after the election, according to analysts.
   ``There's no chance of that now,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief
economist for Prudential Bache Securities Inc. ``But, at the same
time, I don't think that the Fed is going to tighten either so
interest rates will be flat the rest of the year.''
   Long-term bonds opened more than a point lower and the Dow Jones
average of 30 industrial stocks was down at 11.59 at 10 a.m.,
largely on the falling bond prices, Yardeni said.
   Today's figures showed 193,000 more Americans at work than in
September, with the number of jobless people totaling only 6.5
million.
   The report said that the percentage of working-age Americans with
jobs remained at a record 62.4 percent.
   The number of women holding jobs grew by 320,000 while the number
of working men fell by 99,000, according to the Labor Department's
monthly survey of 58,000 households.
   Yardeni and other private economists agreed with Reagan's
assessment that the economy is picking up steam again after slowing
from a growth rate of 3.4 percent in 1987 to 2.2 percent in the
third quarter of this year.
   ``A good case is developing that the fourth quarter will show
stronger growth than the third,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, chief
economist for the National Association of Manufacturers.
   Jasnowski said companies are telling him that their factory
orders, which fell 1.9 percent in September according to the
government, bounced back again last month.
   The slowdown in growth over the summer was more ``drought-related
than most people believed,'' he said. ``It was the most
extraordinary summer in decades and it did slow the pace of things a
bit more than the government's seasonal adjustments did.''
   William Dunkelberg, an economics professor at Temple University
who surveys small businesses, said a record high 34 percent of them
anticipate making major capital investments in the fourth quarter
and an expansion-high 25 percent of them reported unfilled job
openings last month.
   ``Even if you go back to the late 1970s, you don't get numbers
that good,'' he said. ``The unemployment rate is more likely to keep
going down rather than up.''
   Food processing paced the unusually large manufacturing job gains
with 25,000 new jobs logged in October. The department said,
however, that the seasonally adjusted increase in those jobs
reflected fewer fall cutbacks than would normally be the case
because of light summer hiring caused by the drought.
   After ``several months of drought-related slowdowns, the one
month pickup in manufacturing jobs may thus be somewhat
overstated,'' said the commissioner of labor statistics, Janet L.
Norwood.
   Nonetheless, she told the congressional Joint Economic Committee
that there are 422,000 more factory jobs now than had been the case
a year ago.
   Despite October's strong growth, the department said, employment
in just nine of the 20 manufacturing industries was above July's
levels. Other industries showing significant gains included lumber
and wood products, steel and aluminium, machinery, motor vehicles,
and rubber and plastics.
   The 231,000 new jobs on the services side of the economy were
paced by gains of 50,000 in retail trade, 47,000 in health services
and 21,000 in wholesale trade.
   Grocery stores, restaurants and bars all posted healthy gains.
Department store employment, however, edged downward for the fourth
straight month.
   Despite the large manufacturing gains and a drop in new orders
last month, factory workers continued to average four hours a week
in overtime.
   Average hourly earnings rose five cents last month to $9.49, an
increase of 3.8 percent over the last 12 months. In terms of
purchasing power, however, those wages were buying 1 percent less
than they had a year earlier.
   Among the various population groups, the Labor Department
reported these unemployment rates:
   _Men, 5.3 percent, up from 5.2 percent.
   _Women. 5.2 percent, down from 5.5 percent.
   _Whites, 4.6 percent, down from 4.8 percent.
   _Blacks, 11.0 percent, up from 10.8 percent.
   _Hispanics, 7.7 percent, up from 7.4 percent.
   _Teenagers, 14.9 percent, down from 15.7 percent.
   _Black teenagers, 26.5 percent, down from 32.2 percent.
   An alternate unemployment rate, including the 1,687,000 members
of the armed forces stationed in the United States, stood at 5.2
percent last month, also down 0.1 percentage point from September.
   On the eve of today's report, both economic and political
analysts saw little chance that the new numbers would affect next
week's presidential election.
   The last time the jobless figures had any impact was in the 1982
midterm election at the depth of the worst recession since the
1930s. Republicans lost 26 seats in the House six years ago, a week
after the government announced that unemployment had hit 10.4
percent.
   ``That was a major indicator then that what President Reagan had
led the country to expect did not come to pass,'' said Richard
Brody, a political science professor at Stanford University.
   This year, Brody said, the economic numbers contribute to a
popular feeling that the president is doing a good job. That
translates into support for the candidate of the president's party,
Bush.

   A top Foreign Ministry official today said the
Soviet Union has suspended its troop withdrawal from Afghanistan
because of heavy attacks by rebels, and he hinted the pullout might
not be completed by a Feb. 15 deadline.
   Heavy attacks by insurgents with arms supplied by the United
States, Pakistan and other countries ``does not provide conditions''
for the pullout, First Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander
Bessmertnykh told a news conference.
   ``The withdrawal of the troops is being suspended,'' he said,
adding that the date at which the withdrawal is completed is not
important.
   Bessmertnykh also said the Soviet Union ``is now delivering to
the military forces of Afghanistan additional and more powerful
means of destruction.''
   Reports have said MiG-27 fighter planes and SS-1 Scud missiles
have been introduced by the Soviet Union in Afghanistan in recent
weeks and used in attacks on the Afghan resistance.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
Soviet actions ``can only increase tensions in the region and raise
speculation that they are't going to live up to the Geneva
accords,'' which call for Soviet troops to be out of Afghanistan by
Feb. 15.
   The Soviet Union says supplies of arms to the rebels violate the
April 14 Geneva agreement under which the Soviet Union agreed to
withdraw its more than 100,000 soldiers. It has pulled out half the
troops.
   Bessmertnykh criticized an ``unremittant flow of armaments of
U.S. and other origins'' to the rebels.
   ``The Soviet Union intends to stand by its obligations under the
Geneva accords,'' he said. But in order for the Geneva agreement to
be fulfilled, all four countries that signed it _ the United States,
Soviet Union, Afghanistan and Pakistan _ must obey its provisions,
he said.
   ``If none of the countries violate them, the accords will be
fulfilled by the Soviet Union,'' Bessmertnykh said.
   He said that although the Soviet Union was introducing more
powerful weapons in Afghanistan, the quantities of soldiers and
weapons remained constant.
   Repeating an earlier warning, State Department spokesman Charles
E. Redman said, ``If the introduction of this weaponry is an attempt
to intimidate Pakistan, then Moscow should know that Pakistan enjoys
our full support. The use of the weapons represents a further
escalation in the level of violence.''
   A senior Western diplomat in Moscow, briefing reporters on
condition of anonymity, said new weapons were more a means of
political than military pressure.
   ``It is difficult to win a war against guerrillas with
ground-to-ground missiles, long-range bombers, or even ground-attack
aircraft based close by,'' said the diplomat. ``Some of what is
happening is intended to convey a political message rather than
achieve a military objective.''
   Bessmertnykh said 230 Afghan civilians were killed and 580 were
wounded in raids by insurgents in October alone.
   He said Soviet forces also have suffered casualties in hundreds
of artillery and rocket attacks by the insurgents but refused to say
how many Soviets had been killed or injured. Bessmertnykh reiterated
that Soviet soldiers were not engaged in offensive actions against
the insurgents.
   Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979, replaced
one pro-Soviet government with another. They remained to fight the
insurgency.

   A man accused of raping his 12-year-old
stepdaughter took the girl and her sister hostage in an attic,
shooting to death the stepdaughter and wounding himself and the
other child, police said.
   The shootings occurred Thursday when officers attempted to arrest
Emanuel Shoulders for the alleged rape, said police Sgt. Chip Pippen.
   Shoulders had apparently learned of the arrest warrant sworn out
by his wife and picked up the girls at school, taking them to a
brother-in-law's home, Pippen said.
   Pippen said about a half-hour after police knocked on the door,
they heard gunshots.
   Shoulders was in critical condition at Hinds General Hospital
with a head wound, said hospital spokeswoman Donna Ritchey.
   Six-year-old Latasha Shoulders was in intensive care after
surgery today at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. Dawn
Shoulders died at the hospital.

   An immigration judge has ordered that a
Winnetka, Ill., man be deported to Australia because he persecuted
Jews and other civilians while serving in a Nazi execution squad
during World War II, the Justice Department announced today.
   Konrads Kalejs has until Nov. 14 to appeal Tuesday's decision by
immigration judge Anthony D. Petrone of Chicago.
   In a case brought by the Justice Department's Nazi-hunting unit,
the Office of Special Investigations, Petrone found that Kalejs
served in Nazi-occupied Latvia as a company commander in the Arajs
Kommando. Kalejs was found to have commanded guards at the Nazi
concentration camps of Salaspils in Latvia and Porkhov in Russia
where thousands of civilians died.
   Along with the Kalejs case, OSI is prosecuting cases against
Edgards Inde of Minneapolis, Minn.; Valdis Didrichsons of Seattle;
and Mikelis Kirsteins of Syracuse, N.Y., who are alleged to have
served with Kalejs.
   Petrone found that Kalejs concealed his service in the Arajs
Kommando when applying to enter the United States from Australia.
Kalejs, who came to this country in 1959, remains an Australian
citizen. Petrone ruled that Kalejs' involvement in acts of
persecution rendered him ineligible to immigrate to the United
States.
   Kalejs also maintains a residence in St. Petersburg, Fla., said
Justice Department spokesman John Russell.

<HEAD>Bush Hits Massachusetts ``Mess,'' Dukakis Says He's Gaining</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with Bush comments on fund-raiser's firm, subbing 4
grafs for 3rd graf, ``The test</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush accused rival Michael Dukakis today of ``borrowing
like mad'' to deal with a fiscal mess in Massachusetts, while
Dukakis declared he is coming back in the presidential race as
voters realize he ``will stand up for them.''
   With the election just four days away, both candidates were
hitting hard in campaign stops and in television appearances and
advertisements. Polls continued to show Bush with a lead, but
Dukakis and his aides said the race was getting closer.
   Also today, in an interview with The Associated Press, Bush
criticized a private firm's effort to win a public relations
contract with the government of Haiti by touting the connections of
one of the firm's partners, Bush fund-raiser Fred Bush, to the vice
president.
   ``I denounce it. I don't like it. I think it's wrong,'' the
Republican nominee said, adding that he had spoken about it to Fred
Bush, who is no relation to him. Fred Bush had said previously the
contact with Haiti was made without his knowledge.
   The vice president said in the interview that voters ``know I've
been in public life for 20 years, and no one has ever made any
allegations about impropriety on my part, because they know how
strongly I feel about ethics and government.''
   Dukakis, on NBC's ``Today'' program, said, ``The test of a good
president isn't who comes up with the best commercial. In the last
two or three weeks people are getting a much better sense of who
Mike Dukakis is, who wants to be president of the United States, and
I think that's one of the reasons frankly why we're doing better and
closing this gap.''
   ``I think they see in Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen a very
strong team that will stand up for them and I think that's the
fundamental issue,'' he said.
   His voice sounded improved from the previous day when it grew
hoarse as he spoke at rally after rally.
   Bush, meanwhile, traveled to Fairfield, Conn., to take a poke at
fiscal problems in Dukakis' neighboring Massachusetts.
   The Republican nominee held up a Boston newspaper labeling the
fiscal situation ``a mess,'' and he accused Gov. Dukakis of
``borrowing like mad'' and ``kiting checks.''
   State officials said this week they were planning to cut state
spending to head off a potential budget deficit after learning of a
revenue shortfall in October.
   Bush said Dukakis got into the situation ``by overspending. How
did he get out of it, or try to? By raising taxes a total of $180
million this year alone. ... Now he's borrowing like mad, writing
checks that he doesn't even have enough money in the bank to cover.''
   Dukakis was campaigning in New York and Kentucky and ending the
day with a walk in Chicago's torchlight parade, a traditional show
of Democratic Party unity.
   Bush was traveling to four states today _ Connecticut and the
industrial battlegrounds of Ohio, Michigan and New Jersey.
   According to sources in both parties, Republican and Democratic
tracking polls showed Bush leading nationally by a margin of seven
to nine percentage points, within the range of the nationwide
surveys released earlier this week. Democrats contended there was
still opportunity for Dukakis, with sizable numbers of undecided or
weakly committed voters.
   By states, private polls pointed to a significant Republican lead
in Ohio; Dukakis held a narrow margin in one New York survey and a
slight advantage in Washington where he was ahead by 10 points in a
statewide poll with a five point margin of error. Both Illinois and
California, where Dukakis will wind up his campaigning, were rated
close.
   Meanwhile, the Bush campaign announced late Thursday that the
eighth person connected with the vice president's ethnic council had
resigned his post following reports of ties to Nazi or anti-Semitic
groups.
   In Washington, Bush spokesman Mark Goodin confirmed reports that
during World War II Akselis Mangulis had been a member of the
Latvian Legion, a group which had connections to the German SS, the
quasi-military unit of the Nazi Party.
   Mangulis had been chairman of Latvians for Bush.
   Across the country there was yet another round of new television
commercials.
   Dukakis was airing a tough new ad that zeroed in on Republican
vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle. It shows the most remembered
moment of Quayle's debate with his Democratic counterpart, when
Bentsen said, ``Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.'' On the screen
appear the words, ``President Quayle?''
   The Republican Party aired a new ad featuring President Reagan
and the boast of good times.
   ``America is at peace, and we are prosperous once more ...'' the
president says. ``I hope you will vote Republican _ up and down the
ticket _ to continue the change we began in 1981.''
   Today, in remarks prepared for delivery in Palos Hills, Ill,
where he was speaking at a Bush rally, Reagan said, ``The last eight
years have been good years, but I've got a hunch that, when George
Bush gets in the saddle ... we ain't seen nothing yet.''
   The Justice Department, meanwhile, said it it will investigate
Democratic complaints that a Republican ad in South Texas is
intimidating Spanish-speaking voters. The ad, in Spanish, says
``voting officials will be watching closely'' and warns of penalties
for non-citizens who try to vote.
   Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, unveiled a new $400 million
program to fight drugs in the schools. He renewed his charge that
Bush ``cut deals with foreign drug runners'' and failed in leading
the administration's anti-drug war.

   One in eight medical students suffers from major
symptoms of depression because of the ``pressure-cooker'' atmosphere
in medical school, scientists report.
   ``The study documents what many medical educators have long
assumed, which is that medical school is a depressing place to be if
you're a medical student,'' Peter Zeldow, associate professor of
psychiatry at Chicago's Northwestern University Medical School, said
Thursday.
   The four-year study, reported in today's Journal of the American
Medical Association, followed a class of 121 students at Rush
Medical College in Chicago.
   At any point in four years of medical school, at least 12 percent
of the doctors-in-training showed signs of depression. At the end of
the second year, the figure rose to about 25 percent and then
receded.
   By contrast, about 5 percent of the U.S. population suffers from
depression, the researchers said.
   The students' symptoms of depression included sleep disturbance,
pessimism, sense of failure, suicidal wishes and loss of sex drive.
   ``The majority of medical students are quite unhappy or
miserable, whether they are suffering from depression or not,''
Zeldow said.
   The study's authors, Zeldow and David Clark, associate professor
of psychiatry at Rush, pointed to medical school itself as a major
cause of the depression.
   ``It's just a pressure cooker and if we dropped any cross section
of the population into it they would get depressed,'' Clark said.
   ``The curricula they provide are too dense with information,''
Zeldow said. ``There's no doubt inadequate attention is paid to the
emotional needs of the students.''
   The type of people in medical school is also a factor, Clark said.
   ``The qualities that make you a conscientious, fanatical student
have a cost,'' Clark said.
   The researchers differed on whether medical students' depression
would influence the care they give patients when they become
practicing physicians

   Iranians marched in the streets of Tehran
today shouting ``Death to America!'' to mark the ninth anniversary
of the takeover of the U.S. Embassy by militants who held 52
Americans hostage for 444 days.
   Tehran Radio, monitored in Nicosia, said the crowds converged on
Tehran University for a rally and prayers on the ``anniversary of
the takeover of the den of spies and the struggle against global
arrogance.''
   It did not give an estimate of crowd size but broadcast tapes of
people shouting in Farsi: ``Death to America!''
   On Nov. 4, 1979, militants stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and
seized 65 hostages. They released 13 hostages within 16 days but
held 52 for 14 months.
   The militants claimed the embassy was used for spying.
   A similar march was held Wednesday outside the former embassy
compound, which Revolutionary Guard troops took over after the
hostages were freed.
   Officials decided to mount that march two days before the
anniversary so it would not interfere with prayers on Friday, the
Moslem sabbath. Today's demonstrators marched to a prayer service
held every Friday.
   Hashemi Rafsanjani, Parliament speaker and commander-in-chief,
led today's prayers. He called for unity among Moslems against
``global arrogance,'' a term often used for policies of the United
States.
   Iranian officials have made such appeals since a U.N.-sponsored
cease-fire halted their eight-year war with Iraq on Aug. 20. The
calls are part of a campaign to restore normal relations between
Iran and neighboring Arab states.
   Also speaking at today's ceremony was Sheik Mohammed Hussein
Fadlallah, spiritual guide of Lebanon's pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or
Party of God. That group is believed to be an umbrella for Moslem
fundamentalists holding 14 foreign hostages, including nine
Americans, in Lebanon.
   In his speech, Fadlallah said militants in Lebanon would continue
to fight Israeli soldiers in south Lebanon, Tehran Radio said.
Israel maintains its own security zone up to 10 miles into
neighboring Lebanon and sometimes clashes with local militias.

<TEXT>
   George Bush today assailed a long-time
associate's public relations firm for trying to capitalize on ties
to the vice president. ``I denounce it,'' Bush said.
   The vice president said in an interview that he had spoken to
Fred Bush, a top Republican fund-raiser who is not related to him,
about the solicitation to the Haitian government made by Fred Bush's
partner, Michael Govan.
   ``I denounce it. I don't like it. I think it's wrong,'' Bush
said, giving his first comment on the matter during an interview
aboard Air Force Two en route to Cincinnati.
   Asked why voters should believe he would fill a Bush
administration with people who were not intent on influence
peddling, Bush replied, ``They know I've been in public life for 20
years, and no one has ever made any allegations about impropriety on
my part, because they know how strongly I feel about ethics in
government.''
   The GOP presidential nominee, who rarely mentions the White House
ethics office he proposed early in the campaign, said he sitll
intends to set up one if elected.
   On another matter, Bush said he would favor taking steps toward a
free trade agreement with Mexico, along the lines of the one with
Canada, but he siad he would not favor that arrangement with Japan
at this point.
   ``Mexico might be a very good place for the next major step of
that nature. Japan is a little more complicated,'' he said.
   On the Haiti matter, Fred Bush has said his partner acted over
his veto and without his knowledge in seeking a contract for Bush &
Company to represent Haiti. He called it a ``rotten, rotten thing to
happen'' to him and to the Bush campaign.
   The firm's letter touted Fred Bush's connections to the vice
president.
   A former vice presidential staffer, Fred Bush was deputy finance
director of the presidential campaign and is now a fund-raising
consultant working with the Republican National Committee on the
general election.
   At a rally in Fairfield, Conn., earlier today, Bush brandished a
headline that labeled the Massachusetts budget situation ``a mess.''
   Seeking to undermine rival Michael Dukakis' support in the
governor's home territory, Bush accused Dukakis of ``borrowing like
mad'' and ``kiting checks.''
   ``Bank overdraft $373,000,'' Bush said, reading from Wednesday's
front page of the Boston Herald, as he addressed a rally at
Fairfield University in neighboring Connecticut. The Herald headline
read ``What a Mess.''
   ``And that's what's happening in what used to be called the
Massachusetts miracle. Regrettably it turns out to be a mirage,''
Bush said.
   The news story referred to a $49 million shortfll in state
revenue during October. State officials said this week that a plan
to slash state spending to head off a potential budget deficit was
in the offing.
   Bush said Dukakis got into the situation ``by overspending. How
did he get out of it, or try to? By raising taxes a total of $180
million this year alone. ... Now he's borrowing like mad, writing
checks that he doesn't even have enough money in the bank to cover.''
   ``He may want to be on your side, but I don't think the American
people want to be on his side,'' Bush said.
   Bush's regional campaign director, Ron Kaufman, said the campaign
hoped to capitalize on new polling that shows Bush trailing by only
7 points in Dukakis' home state. ``All we've been doing in
Massachusetts in this campaign is holding up a mirror,'' Kaufman
told reporters.
   He said the campaign is mailing ads to Democrats and independent
voters in counties where President Reagan won in 1984, focusing on
the state's economic situation.
   In Connecticut, Kaufman said Bush leads by nine percentage points.
   The GOP presidential nominee is hopscotching back and forth among
a handful of states where the race is close, focusing on the Midwest
and ``going to places where we think it's a little bit soft,'' said
Bush's chief of staff Craig Fuller.
   Those places included Illinois, Ohio and New Jersey on Thursday.
Today's schedule calls for campaigning in Connecticut, Ohio,
Michigan and back to New Jersey.
   ``At this stage in the campaign George Bush has secured a broad
base of supporters and is trying to broaden it still further by
indicating that his views and his values are consistent with
mainstream America,'' Fuller said.
   Thus, while Bush spent earlier weeks painting Dukakis as a
liberal who is out of step with the mainstream, he now is taking the
next step to portray himself as the mainstream candidate.
   Bush uses the word dozens of times a day in rally after rally.
   ``I represent the mainstream, the mainstream views and values and
these are your views and values and we are the change and we are the
mainstream,'' Bush told a rally at Farleigh Dickinson University in
Hackensack, N.J..
   ``It is the people of America who will decide what victory means.
What I am asking the people to give me on November 8 is not just a
political victory but a mandate from the mainstream,'' he added.
   The outreach to those beyond the Republican faithful includes
invoking the names of popular Democratic presidents Franklin D.
Roosevelt, Harry Truman and John F. Kennedy.
   Bush told a rally at Bloom Township High School outside Chicago
that those presidents ``were talking mainstream values,'' but that
Dukakis has too narrow a vision to encompass their mantle.

   The family of a college student who died after
drinking nearly a quart of a toxic solution as part of a class
experiment has sued for $2.5 million.
   A student who fell ill but survived sought damages of $10,000 in
the negligence suit filed Thursday in state court against Pierce
College, two hospitals, the state and the manufacturer and
distributor of the solution.
   The 27 students in the anatomy and physiology class June 1 were
conducting an experiment, which called for drinking simple saline
solution to test urinary output.
   Two volunteers, Dawn Collins, 29, and Shellie McCallen, 18, drank
the liquid.
   Instead of swallowing simple saline solution, the women were
given isotonic buffered saline solution containing the toxic sodium
azide.
   Ms. Collins lost consciousness, vomited and suffered diarrhea.
She died June 5.
   The college has denied irresponsible behavior.
   Geoffrey Fenton, a spokesman for the product's distributor,
Baxter Healthcare Corp. of Deerfield, Ill., said the solution is
clearly marked for external use and meets federal standards.

who alleged that Iraq attacked them with chemical weapons, the
provincial governor said Friday.
   A second group of 1,800 Kurds would be transferred to houses in
this eastern city in the next few days, Gov. Adil Yazar said.
   The Kurds had been living in tents.
   About 60,000 Kurdish refugees fled from Iraq during its

   The refugees were moved to 444 houses that had been vacant

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Subway trains rolled into the St. Augustin station
this week to the tinkling of triangles while waiting commuters made
music by waving their arms.
   The strange phenomenon was the work of Christopher Janney, an
sound engineer from Boston who installed a light-sensitive computer
synthesizer on opposite sides of the subway platform to create ``an
interactive sound environment.''
   ``This is not about playing with computers,'' Janney said in an
interview Friday, the last day of the three-day show. ``This is
participatory art, and if I could do it with rubber bands and pencil
and paper, I'd do it.''
   Instead, he uses the latest in computer and sound technology.
Known as ``Reach,'' Janney's creation is composed of electronic
sensing devices placed above the heads of waiting commuters. As they
reach up, they break the light beams, triggering the sensors and
activating various consonant notes recorded digitally on the
sampler-synthesizer.
   Janney, 38, says his goal is to get people to communicate with
each other, to create an interesting experience for people waiting
for the subway and ``to chip away at the old alienated crowd
behavior.''
   Responses from commuters have been mixed. One elderly woman told
him he had no right to ``smash our ears,'' while another
congratulated him for his genius.
   Currently a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Janney studied piano at 11 but turned to jazz and the
drums at 14. He later graduated from Princeton University with a
degree in architecture.
   ``Reach'' is the latest in a series of projects that experiment
with sound in space. In December, he will pump sounds into four
passenger elevators in Miami. Each will have its own individual
sound environment and certain melodic elements will change depending
on the floor it's on.
   ``I'm sure some people will feel invaded, but it's a question of
putting sound in spaces that's harmonious or soothing,'' he said
adding that there is no such thing as absolute silence.
   Last year, Janney's ``Soundstair'' toured the United States and
Europe, transforming the steps of Faneuil Hall Marketplace in Boston
and Rome's Spanish Steps into musical staircases.
   His work is subsidized largely by grants and his equipment
donated or loaned by major corporations. Each project installation
costs about $5,000.
   Janney says Parisians can forget about reproducing familiar tunes
because he has grouped the instruments in unconventional groups that
change every hour.
   ``The project not about creating melodic forms, rather it's more
about ideas of Indian music, drones, and harmonies that somehow
change the nature and quality of the space they're put in,'' he said.
   Janney is hoping the Paris transit authority will find a
permanent home for ``Reach.'' The Mississippi Museum of Art and the
Boston Museum of Science have two of Janney's site-specific projects
in their permanent collections.

<HEAD>Voters In Four Bay Area Counties To Consider Rent Control Ballot
Measures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER McNULTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rent control will be on the ballot in four
northern California communities: Santa Cruz wants to ban it,
Berkeley and San Francisco want to expand it and Sonoma wants to
limit it to certain low-income residents.
   In Santa Cruz County, voters will consider a proposal banning
future rent control measures. It would repeal an ordinance
protecting residents of mobile home parks and a law requiring a
percentage of new construction to be ``affordable housing.''
   In San Francisco, Measure U would extend existing rent control to
vacant residential units.
   Current law limits rent increases on occupied residential units
to 4 percent to 7 percent annually. Measure U would put the same cap
on vacant units, a move supporters say is needed to stem the tide of
wrongful evictions and ``massive rent hikes'' that have occurred
since rent control was established in 1979.
   Without limiting rents on a unit that becomes vacant, current law
leaves a ``loophole'' which supporters say many landlords find
irresistible.
   Critics including Mayor Art Agnos and even some housing activists
say Measure U is drafted so strictly that it is doomed to fail. They
call it an extreme measure that would penalize landlords who have
not raised rents for longtime tenants and would result in a loss of
rental units.
   Opponents plan to spend about $800,000 to defeat Measure U. Less
than a week before the election, supporters had raised about $18,000.
   The Sonoma County proposal would change the existing mobile home
rent control ordinance to apply only to low income tenants. If
approved, Measure H would allow park owners to raise mobile home
space rents by a maximum of nine percent per year for a period of
two years following approval.
   Berkeley voters will decide among three rent control-related
measures. Measure K, the broadest, would require landlords to
register with the city, listing current rents being charged for all
units. Tenants would be notified when registration fees and
penalties went unpaid for more than six months and, beginning in
1989, would let landlords set the initial rent for single family
dwellings.
   It would also tighten restrictions on allowable evictions and
rent increases.
   Measure L, placed on the ballot by the Berkeley City Council
after Measure K qualified for the ballot, would make similar but
fewer changes. It contains several provisions designed to create
incentives for rental property owners including removal of punitive
criminal penalties and the elimination of merely technical
violations, according to supporters who include Mayor Loni.
   A third Berkeley proposal, Measure I, would allow rent board
commissioners who own rental property to participate in all Rent
Board decisions except those involving rent adjustments on their own
units.
   If approved, all board members would be treated the same, whether
they are tenants or owners. Critics, who call Measure I ``special
interest legislation,'' say the existing law prevents landlords from
voting on issues in which they could enjoy substantial monetary
benefits.

<HEAD>Board Says It Will Place Insurance Commissioner On Leave</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief of the state Board of Insurance
has been placed on leave while the board investigates allegations of
foot-dragging in the largest insurance company insolvency case in
Texas history.
   The board also said Thursday that the Travis County District
Attorney's Office will review the agency's handling of the National
County Mutual Fire Insurance insolvency case for any criminal
wrongdoing.
   National County Mutual, a Dallas company with 125,000 auto
insurance policyholders statewide, was declared insolvent last week
and taken over by the insurance board. The company was $54 million
in the debt.
   The board said recent criticism prompted it to initiate the
investigation into the department's delay in taking control of
National County Mutual.
   Several lawmakers complained the insurance board's staff knew of
the company's problems since at least 1986 and should have moved
earlier to protect its policyholders.
   During the examination, Commissioner Doyce Lee will be placed on
leave, board members said.
   Board members said Lee recommended doing the independent audit
and contacting the district attorney. But they said complaints by
state lawmakers and consumer interest representatives forced them to
put him on leave.
   Lee, 47, commissioner since 1985, said he agreed with the
decision.
   ``I think it takes the pressure off of me and the board, and the
agency can go about its business of regulating the industry. That
will give time for the air to clear,'' he said.
   State Rep. John Gavin, D-Wichita Falls, chairman of the House
Insurance Committee, supported the board's action.
   ``Most of the problem seems to be a lack of communication within
the agency. The left hand and the right hand don't seem to work very
well together,'' he said.
   Insurance board members attribute many of its problems to a major
reorganization of the agency and rapid expansion of the staff, from
about 850 employees to 1,300 in the past 18 months.

traffic daily from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. at the request of businesses.
   City Council approved the change Thursday. While hotels and bars
wanted the change approved Thursday by City Council, some souvenir
shops opposed it, saying the mall lures tourists.
   Even with the mall, delivery and service vehicles are allowed on
Bourbon each day from 6 a.m. to 11 a.m.
   The new schedule takes effect in three months and will be
re-evaluated after six months.
   Sal Panzeca, a Bourbon Street property owner who said he
represented bars, hotels and some shops, said the mall hasn't worked
and Bourbon has steadily lost business to other streets with regular
traffic.
   Twenty clubs or other businesses along Bourbon Street have closed
in the last five years, he said.

<HEAD>President Says Lazy Cabinet Ministers Will Be Fired</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zambia's 16 new Cabinet minister were sworn
in Friday with a warning from President Kenneth Kaunda that they'll
be fired if they're lazy.
   The Cabinet, reduced from 22 to cut state spending, was announced
by the head of state on Wednesday. Kaunda was re-elected to a sixth
term last week.
   Zambia is suffering from record unemployment, galloping inflation
and a $5 billion foreign debt that drains 40 percent of export
income.
   ``Inertia is stopping us from reaching the heights that we should
have reached by now,'' Kaunda said at the swearing-in ceremony. ``We
must stop and arrest it.''
   Kaunda has pledged that the new government will introduce
sweeping reforms to revive the economy, battered by a 1970s slump in
price of copper, which accounts for 90 percent of all export
earnings.

<HEAD>Catholic Bishops May Ask Vatican to Reconsider Document</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Council of Catholic Bishops may
ask the Vatican to reconsider a recent document that called for
curtailing the role of such councils.
   At a meeting later this month, the group will consider a report,
drafted by a panel of leading bishops, asking for reconsideration.
   The panel has termed the document ``deficient'' and criticized it
for making ``rigid and confusing'' distinctions without grounds in
church law or from the Second Vatican Conference.
   A two-thirds vote of the bishops will be needed to transmit the
concerns of the group to Rome.
   National conferences of bishops relate the teachings of the Roman
Catholic Church to the people of their nations. However, on occasion
the bishops in one nation take different positions from those in
another on social or political issues such as nuclear disarmament or
income distribution. Such instances cause concern in Rome.
   The Vatican working paper sent to bishops conferences worldwide
for comment warned of the potential for disharmony with Rome and
harm to the appearance of automomy of local bishops.
   The U.S. bishops' response seeks a reconsideration of the matter,
terming the initial draft ``deficient enough to suggest that a new
draft should be framed.''
   Members of the U.S. committee writing the response were
Archbishop John May of St. Louis, retired Cardinal John Krol of
Philadelphia, Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago, Archbishop John
R. Quinn of San Francisco, Archbishop John R. Roach of St. Paul and
Minneapolis and Bishop James W. Malone of Youngstown, Ohio. The late
Cardinal John Dearden of Detroit also participated.

<HEAD>Dead Bullets May Have Saved Public Housing Director's Life</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six dud bullets may have saved the life
of the city's public housing chief, police said.
   A woman who had been threatening tenants with a handgun Thursday
pointed it at Housing Authority Executive Director Larry Cole when
he went out to deal with her, and pulled the trigger several times.
The gun merely clicked.
   Cole said he figured the gun was unloaded, but police discovered
later that the six-shot .22-caliber revolver was fully loaded and in
good condition _ only the ammunition was bad.
   ``That's the only thing they can see that kept the gun from
discharging and him from getting shot,'' said police Sgt. Carl
Thompson. Each bullet had three or four dents in it from the hammer,
so the trigger had been pulled at least 18 times, he said.
   Police knew of no motive for the incident, in which Cole
confronted a woman threatening tenants standing on their balconies
at a housing complex.
   ``I kept telling her to put the gun down and step back,'' he
said. ``She was about 25 yards away, and she was drunk. So I figured
the odds were pretty good that I wouldn't get shot.''
   Eventually, he said, the gun slipped from her hand.
   Police charged Elaine Harris, 33, with attempted murder. She was
jailed on $100,000 bail. Cole said the woman told him she was not a
tenant of the housing project and had recently had been released
from a state mental hospital.
   ``It's just part of the job. It was not a big thing,'' Cole said.
``You've got to get the attention away from the tenants. I was more
concerned about my tenants.''

   Seven bombs, including some concealed in
sewing machines, killed 26 people and wounded 50 in the Punjab town
of Batala today, police said.
   ``We suspect Sikh terrorists are behind the explosions,'' Batala
police chief S.M. Sharma said.
   Late Thursday, 11 people were killed when Sikh gunmen ambushed a
bus in northern Punjab, police said.
   A police spokesman in Punjab's state capital Chandigarh said 26
people were killed when the bombs exploded in rapid succession at a
crowed market place in a Hindu neighborhood.
   ``There were seven explosions. They were so powerful that limbs
of victims flew all over the place,'' said the spokesman, who cannot
be identified under briefing rules, said.
   Sharma said some of the explosives were concealed in two sewing
machines which were left on bicycles 200 yards apart.
   ``They were very powerful. Some of the injured are in critical
condition,'' Sharma said in a telephone interview. Sharma said the
victims were 22 Hindus, three Sikhs and a Christian.
   ``We have imposed a curfew in the area and more police are being
set to counter any retaliation'' in case of a Hindu backlash of
violence, Sharma said.
   The police spokesman in Chandigarh said the state's borders with
Haryana and Jammu-Kashmir were sealed after the blasts. ``We have
also announced a new state-wide alert,'' he said.
   He said police and paramilitary troops were searching the Batala
area. No arrests were reported.
   Batala, 30 miles north of the Sikh holy city of Amritsar, has a
population of 150,000. Hindus outnumber Sikhs in the town and
control the trade.
   Late Thursday, Sikh attackers fired on a bus after the driver
ignored their warnings to stop near Gujarpura, 30 miles northeast of
Amritsar, police said.
   Six people were killed inside the bus and five were slain after
they jumped out of the bus and tried to flee, a police spokesman
said. Six people were injured.
   The attackers, armed with AK-47 semi-automatic assault rifles,
escaped in a jeep, authorities said.
   Sikh radicals are fighting for an independent nation in Punjab
state. They claim they are discriminated against by Hindus, India's
religious majority, and need a separate homeland to preserve their
religion and culture.
   Sikhs make up about two percent of India's 880 million people,
but they are a majority in Punjab.

   A helicopter carrying oil company
workers crashed in the Gulf of Mexico early today, and four people
were missing and believed dead, officials said. Two other passengers
were rescued by a workboat.
   A search was under way for the missing after the helicopter went
down near an oil rig about 120 miles south of Cameron, Mobil Oil
Exploration & Producing Southeast said in a statement.
   The two rescued men were in serious condition at St. Patrick's
Hospital with leg and chest injuries, said spokeswoman Debbie Serra.
   Michael O'Malley, a Mobil spokesman in Dallas, said four
passengers were Mobil employees and one was a welder employed by a
contractor.
   Chuck Johnson, executive vice president of ERA Helicopters, which
owned and operated the craft, said the ERA pilot was among those
missing.
   He said the pilot's radio calls did not indicate any trouble.
``It was right on takeoff,'' he said. ``We don't believe weather was
a factor in this. The weather was good out there. We had a 25-knot
wind.''
   He said the National Transportation Safety Board would
investigate.

   Russ Pengelly figured the only way to protect
public land was to get the public out there using it, so he and his
hiking buddies set out to create a hiking corridor from Mexico to
Canada _ in the desert.
   ``You can't see the country unless you get out and walk,'' said
Pengelly, a retired high school biology teacher who is president of
the Desert Trail Association, which focuses on the arid eastern side
of the Cascades and Sierra Nevada.
   He spoke while following a game trail through brush in the
Diamond Craters, a volcanic area about 35 miles south of Burns.
Along the way he kicked at a broken obsidian arrowhead, pointed out
a bleached cow bone and examined bobcat tracks.
   ``I always quote John Muir, who said you can't really study
nature rushing through the country 40 miles a day in a stagecoach,''
Pengelly said.
   ``If you get people out looking at the land, I think they will
want to protect it,'' he said.
   Though the Desert Trail Association was formed 25 years ago, it
is far from its goal. It has mapped out about 150 miles of trail in
southeastern Oregon, 25 miles in Nevada and about 50 miles in
southern California.
   Much of the land along the route, using existing trails where
possible, is controlled by the federal Bureau of Land Management,
which has cooperated with the association although its trail has no
official status.
   The guide for the trail through Nevada's High Rock Canyon hasn't
been issued yet because the association doesn't have the money to
produce a full-color brochure. A black-and-white guide for the
latest section of Oregon trail is due out soon.
   The first section of Oregon trail, which runs from the Nevada
border at Denio 25 miles north to Fields, is marked by stone cairns,
spaced within sight of each other.
   But they never built cairns for the next five sections of trail,
which runs across the Alvord Desert to Frog Springs, over the Steens
Mountains to Page Springs, past Diamond Craters to Highway 78 near
the Malheur-Harney county line.
   ``I don't think they're necessary,'' said Pengelly. ``And we
haven't had the manpower to do it.''
   Unlike the well-known Appalachian Trail and its Western
counterpart, the Pacific Crest Trail, Pengelly doesn't want the
desert trail to be a line on the ground that people adhere o without
question. Instead, he thinks of it as a corridor through which
hikers can wander.
   ``It's a trail that leads to a great deal more adventure and
freedom than a designated tread that leads from one point to
another,'' he said.
   The first white men to see this country were trappers from the
Hudson's Bay Company, in 1826.
   Later in the 19th century, cattle barons were drawn by the grassy
hills. One lasting mark of those times is the Round Barn near Riddle
Mountain. It was built in 1880 by Pete French, who built the P Ranch
to 132,000 acres before he was shot by a competitor in 1897.
   The conical roof is built around a tall juniper trunk and covers
a stone corral 60 feet in diameter. The idea was to break horses
inside the barn during the winter, but the horses wouldn't buck
until they got outside, so the idea was abandoned.
   Hikers through this country of grassy hills, rocky buttes and
deep gorges can see antelope and mule deer, red-tailed hawks and
horned larks, as well as the purple blossoms of monkey flower and
the yellow of blazing star.
   ``All this land you can wander over,'' Pengelly said. ``You do
own it. The public owns it. That's one of the things about when
people talk about selling off the public lands to pay off the
national debt. They would be selling off their legacy.''

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bill Kovach, editor since 1986 of The Atlanta
Journal and The Atlanta Constitution, resigned today in a dispute
with the newspapers' management.
   Kovach's abrupt departure came nearly two years after he left the
post of Washington bureau chief of The New York Times to take over
the newspapers. His appointment was widely seen as part of an
attempt by the papers to achieve national prominence.
   Publisher Jay Smith said ``an irreconcilable difference in
management styles'' emerged in a discussion earlier today and
prompted Kovach's departure.
   However, Smith said he felt he and Kovach were in accord
philosophically over the direction the newspapers have taken under
Kovach.
   ``I am proud of the progress we have made under Bill,'' Smith
said. ``It is my commitment that we will continue to grow, continue
to find better ways to serve readers and continue to add to the
stature of the newspapers and Atlanta.''
   Kovach said in a statement that his resignation ``was the
culmination of two years of effort to develop a set of shared values
and mutual trust with the senior managers of the company.''
   ``Unfortunately I was unable to do that. It became clear this
week that no such relationship existed,'' he said. ``The continuing
challenge to realize the real potential of the Atlanta newspapers is
too great to attempt under those conditions.''
   Kovach's plans were not immediately known.
   His resignation was announced to the Journal-Constitution
newsroom by Assistant Managing Editor Wendell ``Sonny'' Rawls, who
followed Kovach from The New York Times.
   The news stunned reporters who in 1986 had greeted word of his
appointment with jubilation.
   Kovach grew up in Tennessee reading the Atlanta papers, then
under the leadership of civil rights advocate Ralph McGill.
   He said he took the editorship of the Cox Newspapers' flagship to
``strengthen McGill's newspaper and to practice journalism the way I
envisioned it.''
   He stressed hard news and aggressiveness, and among his successes
was a series outlining how some Atlanta banks were refusing loans to
residents of predominantly black neighborhoods.
   The Democratic National Convention gave the newspapers a chance
to shine to a national audience, and their coverage was favorably
commented on.

<HEAD>US Distressed by Suspension of Soviet Troop Withdrawal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan registered disappointment
Friday over a Soviet decision to suspend troop withdrawals from
Afghanistan.
   Administration officials called the move disturbing and accused
Moscow of raising tensions in the war-torn country, but they
stressed that the Soviets could still meet their commitment to pull
out by Feb. 15.
   During a political campaign stop in Chicago, the president noted
that the Soviets had renewed that pledge even while announcing the
suspension in Moscow.
   At the end of a week of U.S. complaints about new Soviet weapons
shipments to Afghanistan, White House press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater said Soviet actions ``can only increase tensions in the
region and raise speculation that they are't going to live up to the
Geneva accords.''
   The Soviets pulled out by Aug. 15 half the 100,000 or more troops
they had in Afghanistan. The accords require the others to quit the
country by Feb. 15, but it leaves the timetable up to the Soviets.
   In Moscow, a top Foreign Ministry official said the withdrawal
had been suspended because of strong attacks by anti-government
rebels.
   ``The Soviet troops are being withdrawn due to the good will of
the Soviet government,'' First Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander
Bessmertnykh told a news conference. ``They will be withdrawn in
honorable conditions.''
   But, Bessmertnykh said, the current atmosphere of heavy attacks
by rebels with arms supplied by the United States, Pakistan and
other countries ``does not provide conditions for such a withdrawal
of Soviet troops.''
   Reagan, asked about the statement, said:
   ``I think we are all disappointed by that. At the same time, I
think we should recognize that this is something they have said is
necessary and they have repledged to bring the troops out by Feb.
15.''
   When asked if the United States planned to take any steps as a
result of the Soviet announcement, the president said, ``We haven't
had a chance to sit down and talk it over.''
   Fitzwater, who was traveling with Reagan, said Soviet actions
``raise speculation that they aren't going to live up to the Geneva
accords.'' He added, ``We expect them to ... and hope that is what
their intentions are.''
   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman called the
suspension ``disturbing.'' He also said the Soviets had fired a few
more SS-1 Scud missiles at rebel forces near the border with
Pakistan.
   Redman said the United States had urged the Mujahedeen rebels not
to ``launch actions'' that might delay the withdrawal of Soviet
forces. But, he said, the escalation of violence was bound to
``harden the attitudes'' of the guerrillas.
   He said Bernhanuddin Rabbani, leader of the Islamic Society rebel
group, would arrive in Washington on Monday and meet with Reagan and
Secretary of State George P. Shultz on Wednesday.
   A senior administration official, meanwhile, said that before the
withdrawal suspension the Soviets had discussed starting the pullout
on Nov. 15.
   ``To say they are suspending now raises a question about what
they mean,'' the official said. ``Are they going to resume on Nov.
15, or later?''
   He said the United States continues to urge the Soviets ``to
follow the timetable they have set for themselves, and to meet their
obligations to pull out by the 15th of February.''
   The official added: ``We continue to believe they will do so.
They are engaged more in bluster and efforts to persuade the
Pakistanis to rein in the Mujahedeen and to buck up their own
clients.''

   Dawn Collins was taking a biology course at Pierce
College last spring when she unwittingly drank a toxic solution
during an experiment. Four days later she died, a tragedy that
months of investigation have failed to fully explain.
   Her family blames not only the solution's manufacturer but
health-care workers who, they contend, botched the 29-year-old
woman's treatment. On Thursday, they filed a $2.5 million lawsuit in
Pierce County Superior Court seeking damages for negligence and
outrageous conduct.
   Ms. Collins, of Puyallup, and Shellie McCallen, 18, of Tacoma,
were part of a 27-student anatomy and physiology class at Pierce
College, in the Tacoma suburb of Lakewood about 30 miles south of
Seattle.
   As part of a urine test experiment, the two women drank what was
supposed to be a simple saline solution. Instead, what they
swallowed was isotonic buffered saline solution containing the toxic
preservative sodium azide.
   Both soon became nauseated, Ms. Collins more so because she had
drunk more of the liquid, nearly a quart. Some people become ill
from ingesting as few as 20 milligrams of sodium azide, and Ms.
Collins was believed to have swallowed 700 to 800 milligrams,
according to Pierce County medical examiner Dr. John Howard.
   Ms. Collins lost consciousness, vomited and had diarrhea before
she was taken to Lakewood Hospital, where she was treated and
released the next day. Four days later, on June 5, she fell ill and
died in another hospital. The formal cause of death: sodium azide
poisoning.
   The compound, according to Dr. Bill Robertson of the Seattle
Poison Center, attacks all cells in the body and usually kills
within six hours. In Ms. Collins' case, the dose was not great
enough to do that but did fatally damage her heart, said Robertson,
who as medical director for the Washington Poison Network was
consulted in the case.
   Ms. McCallen, who recovered, has joined in the Collins' family
lawsuit, seeking $100,000 damages, said the plaintiffs' attorney,
Vern Harkins.
   Named as defendants are the state of Washington; Lakewood
Hospital; Multicare Medical Center; the product's manufacturer,
Harleco, owned by E.M. Diagnostics of Gibbstown, N.J.; and American
Scientific Products, a division of Baxter Healthcare Corp., the
product distributor.
   The college and individuals in the case _ including the course's
lecturer, the lab instructor and technician and a college nurse _
are named in court filings as involved parties, but not as
defendants.
   Harkins said Ms. Collins' survivors _ a mother, four sisters and
two brothers _ ``want to see recognition of liability on behalf of
the state and other defendants that errors were made in the death of
Dawn Collins. The're also interested in hopefully seeing that
certain procedures at Pierce Collee are changed.''
   The college said only that it expressed regret for the tragedy.
But Sandy Lewis, who taught the lecture portion of the class, said
the pain on the defense side is pretty bad, too.
   Investigations by the sheriff's department, the county medical
examiner and state attorney general's office turned up conflicting
versions of what happened, according to published reports.
   First there is the question of how the mistake occurred. Geoffrey
Fenton, a spokesman for product distributor Baxter Healthcare Corp.
of Deerfield, Ill., said the solution containing sodium azide is
clearly marked for external use and meets federal standards.
   When the women fell ill, lab technician Nancy Bonenfant reported
that she called the Tacoma Poison Control Center and described the
solution as containing sodium azide and was told that the amount
wasn't significant enough to cause harm.
   But Lind Simonsen, spokesman for Multicare Medical Center, which
operates the poison control center, said an internal review of the
taped conversation with the lab technician proved that the solution
had been described as isotonic buffered solution, not isotonic
buffered saline solution.
   The non-saline solution, he said, is non-toxic, and so the
college was legitimately advised.
   Then there were reports the college nurse didn't arrive on the
scene for 45 minutes and that Ms. Collins wasn't taken to a hospital
for several hours, in part because two of her sisters weren't sure
family insurance would cover medical care.
   The college has denied irresponsible behavior, and the sisters
contend they wanted Ms. Collins helped right away.
   It also remains unclear what information Lakewood Hospital worked
with in treating Ms. Collins. Hospital spokeswoman Genie Latta said
the hospital would have no comment.
   A response to the lawsuit must be filed by in-state defendants
within 20 days and by out-of-state parties within 60 days, then
formal pretrial investigations will begin, according to Senior
Assistant Attorney General Mike Tardis, whose office represents the
college. A trial date may not be set for two or three years because
of court backups, and a settlement could be reached in the interim,
he said.

   Algeria's only political party said
Friday the overwhelming approval of reforms in a referendum show the
time has come for it to stop controlling everything and open
elections to independent candidates.
   The Interior Ministry said 92.27 percent of those voting in
Thursday's referendum, called after bloody riots a month ago,
approved constitutional changes designed to limit the the power of
the National Liberation Front. It said 83.03 percent of the more
than 12 million voters participated.
   Abdelhamid Mehri, chief of the party secretariat, said Friday:
   ``Responsiblities have already been given to citizens who are not
members of the party. The question posed now is that as a matter of
theory we have to throw off this yoke which makes the front appear
to be a party that monopolizes everything,''
   Mehri is No. 2 man to President Chadli Bendjedid in the National
Liberation Front, known in Algeria as the ``parti unique,'' or
single party.
   The front led Algeria to independence from France in 1962 and
since then has run every aspect of political, economic, judicial and
social life. It must approve every candidate for the parliament, the
People's National Assembly.
   After further reforms are adopted, Mehri said, ``all eligible
citizens will be able to run for all elected posts, at both the
municipal or national levels.'' He spoke in an interview with the
French television network Antenne 2.
   Bendjedid chose Mehri last week to replace Mohamed Cherif
Messaadia as head of the party secretariat. Messaadia led the party
old guard and was believed to oppose the reforms put forth by the
presiddent.
   A party congress that begins Nov. 27 is to consider more reforms,
not yet spelled out. Mehri said he believes party members ``will
understand the necessary changes.''
   ``At this congress we will have tough discussions, very hard, but
once the decisions are taken all the party activists will go with
conviction into the battle for change,'' he said.
   The referendum gives Bendjedid a clear popular mandate to pursue
plans at the congress for steps toward eventual free elections and
opening the economy to private enterprise.
   One change adopted Thursday gives new, still unspecified duties
to the premier and makes him answerable to parliament rather than
the president.
   Bendjedid is expected to name a new premier in a few days to
replace Abdelhamid Brahimi. The new man would choose a new Cabinet
and begin work on economic reforms needed to pull Algeria out of a
crisis that spawned the week of riots last month.
   Huge crowds of young Algerians protested food shortages,
unemployment and a declining standard of living. The Interior
Ministry said 176 people were killed, most by soldiers firing into
crowds, but unofficial reports put the death toll at 400 or more.
   Violence ended as abruptly as it began when Bendjedid promised
reform. Groups of doctors, lawyers, journalists, intellectuals and
others have demonstrated since about the alleged torture of those
arrested.
   More than 3,300 people were arrested during the riots, and the
government said Thursday all had been freed.
   In an interview on French TV Thursday night, Interior Minister
Hedi Khediri acknowledged some cases of torture.
   ``Acts of torture were committed, but I can tell you this torture
was by individuals, security agents, on their own initiative and not
in an organized fashion under orders,'' Khediri said.
   ``The army had the task of restoring order. The army restored it
and that's that. I believe that is what was most important.''

   West Germany's Supreme Court on
Friday upheld the conviction of a former U.S. serviceman with AIDS
who failed to use a condom during sex and kept his disease a secret
from his homosexual partners.
   In its decision, the court upheld the November 1987 conviction of
Linwood Boyette, a former U.S. Army cook, for attempting dangerous
bodily harm. But it ordered a lower court to reduce the two-year
sentence imposed a year ago.
   ``In light of the deadly danger of an infection, every
intentional risk on the part of an AIDS-infected person is
punishable,'' the Supreme Court in Karlsruhe said in its judgment.
   The conviction was for attempted bodily harm because it was not
shown that Boyette's two sex partners had in fact contracted the
virus. They have not been identified, and court papers say only that
they met the former serviceman in a club frequented by homosexuals.
   West Germany's AIDS-Help group issued a statement calling
Friday's ruling ``a slap in the face'' for victims of the disease
and ``catastrophic'' for future counseling efforts. The group had
objected after the conviction that it would make some AIDS victims
avoid counseling for fear of criminal prosecution.
   Karl Heinz Becker, who represented Boyette before the Supreme
Court, said the case would have nationwide impact but not set a
binding legal precedent. It was the West German high court's first
ruling in a criminal case involving AIDS.
   Court sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Boyette,
47, served in the U.S. Army's 1st Armored Division in Nuremberg and
had been living in the northern Bavarian city before his arrest.
   Supreme Court officials declined to release Boyette's hometown in
the United States.
   Nuremberg prosecutor's spokesman Gerhard Holzheid said the
conviction in Bavarian State Court stemmed from two cases in which
Boyette had sex without using a condom, even though he was aware of
his illness.
   According to a report in the Munich-based Sueddeutsche Zeitung
daily newspaper, the former soldier was first informed that he was
carrying the AIDS virus by a U.S. military doctor in June 1986.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a deadly affliction in
which a virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread mainly by sexual
contact between homosexual men, the use of contaminated needles
among drug abusers, and transfusion of tainted blood.

   Pro-Iranian kidnappers today accused the
United States of delaying the release of American hostages in
Lebanon by reneging on its ``pledges and promises.''
   The charge came in a statement signed by Islamic Jihad, or
Islamic Holy War, and was accompanied by a photograph of American
journalist Terry A. Anderson, the longest-held of the 14 foreign
hostages in Lebanon.
   It was delivered in a sealed envelope to a Western news agency.
   The photo, which was different from the previous 13 pictures of
Anderson released by the kidnappers, showed him wearing glasses, a
white t-shirt and with a mustache. In a videotaped message released
Oct. 30, he had no mustache.
   In the photo, Anderson was facing a birthday cake with candles
and looked straight into the camera. His right hand appeared ready
to clasp a knife to cut the cake. The kidnappers did not say when
the photo was taken.
   Anderson marked his 41st birthday, his fourth in captivity, Oct.
27.
   ``The only safe way to the freedom of the captives and their
safety is the implementation of our just demands. This is the
essential cornerstone in this issue, nothing else,'' the statement,
typed in Arabic, said. It did not spell out the demands.
   The statement stressed that the release of the hostages was not
connected with the Aug. 20 cease-fire that halted the eight-year
Iran-Iraq war.
   ``We repeat for a thousandth time that the issue of the captives
altogether is not in any way linked to what happens in the (Persian)
gulf. The hope that prevailed in the past has gone forever,'' the
statement said.
   ``Failure to free the hostages is a result of the American
heresy, procrastination and reneging on pledges and promises,'' the
statement said.
   It rebutted President Reagan's assertion that the kidnappers
forced Anderson to read his latest videotaped statement, in which
the hostage accused the U.S. government of interfering to stop his
release.
   In that statement, Anderson read a message accusing Reagan and
Vice President George Bush of failing to do enough to secure his
release.
   It said, ``I've been very close to being released several times
over the past two years. But each time it seems that the U.S.
government uses its influence to stop any agreement from being made.
And I don't understand this.''
   Reagan denied his administration was bargaining with terrorists,
saying: ``I don't think that was Terry speaking. I think he had a
script that was given to him.''
   The message Anderson read said Reagan and Bush negotiated with
terrorists in the Iran-Contra affair and the 1985 hijack of a TWA
jetliner to Beirut.
   Bush has denied he was involved in the Iran-Contra affair or in
any negotiations with the TWA hijackers, who held 39 Americans for
17 days. More than 700 Arab prisoners were released from a northern
Israeli prison in the weeks following the hijacking.
   Today's Islamic Jihad statement said, ``The videotape,
irrespective of its contents, has been issued directly by Terry
Anderson without any pressure.''
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman stood by
the administration's contention that Anderson's taped remarks were
made under duress. ``Anytime you have people being held hostage _
tapes, letters those kinds of things _ are by definition under
duress,'' he said.
   Asked whether the United States had gone back on a deal, as the
kidnappers alleged, for the release of the hostages, Redman said:
``Absolutely not. There have ben no deals. We don't make deals.''
   The Islamic Jihad statement promised that Anderson ``will make an
adequate answer'' to the denials made by Reagan and Bush, but did
not specify when.
   The statement said Islamic Jihad's hostages ``are not isolated
from he outside world.
   ``They see and hear the news from newspapers, magazines and
television stations. They are aware of everything that happened or
will happen about their situation.
   ``What Reagan has said in this regard is like the ostrich that
hides her head in the sand so that the hunter will not see her.''
   The statement also said: ``The U.S. administration, represented
by its president, his vice president, staff and aides carried out
all the deals concerning the hostages.
   ``Otherwise who negotiated in the TWA hijack and why were the 40
passengers and 735 prisoners in Israeli jails freed? Who also
negotiated in the Iran-Contra affair? Who gave the weapons and took
the money and funneled its to the Contras?''
   The 14 foreign hostages in Lebanon include nine Americans.
   Anderson, the chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   Here is the full text of Islamic Jihad's
statement Friday. It was translated from Arabic by The Associated
Press.
   In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate,
   To the free men of the world,
   To the American people,
   To the families of the hostages,
   Day after day the American administration is cheating, lying and
misleading the American people and the families of the hostages to
head off any pressure on the American government to embark upon
realistic steps to resolve the question of the hostages in order to
preserve their (government leaders') posts, privileges and personal
interests. After the American comment by Reagan and Bush about the
contents of the videotape recorded by Terry Anderson, we wish to
clarify the following:
   1. The videotape, irrespective of its contents, has been issued
directly by Terry Anderson without any pressure. It was made in
response to the written and photographed messages which were sent to
him through news agencies. The tape was made after sharp exchanges
between him and us about all the ideas he introduced, which we
considered very lacking. Anderson will make an adequate answer to
these (Reagan's) claims.
   2. America is constantly evading the contents of the videotape
and the messages, which form an irrefutable and incontestable
reality, by casting direct doubts about the tape's contents and by
claiming it was issued by the kidnappers.
   3. The hostages we hold are not isolated from the outside world.
They see and hear the news in newspapers, magazines and television
stations and are aware of everything that happened or will happen
about their situation. What Reagan has said in this regard is like
the ostrich that hides her head in the sand so that the hunter will
not see her.
   4. The U.S. administration, represented by its president, his
vice president, staff and aides carried out all the deals concerning
the hostages. Otherwise who negotiated in the TWA hijack and why
were the 40 passengers and 735 prisoners in Israeli jails freed? Who
also negotiated in the Iran-Contra affair? Who gave the weapons and
took the money and funneled it to the contras? It is strange that
Reagan has lately declared that he does not know so far who offered
the arms and the origin of the money in the Irangate. Isn't it the
American administration? Or are they at a cattle ranch with each
seeking his own ends? If they really knew, that will be an
undeniable calamity, and if they didn't, that will be an even
greater catastrophy.
   5. It has also been said that the cease-fire in the gulf will
speed up the release of the captives with us. We repeat for a
thousandth time that the issue of the captives altogether is not in
any way linked to what happens in the gulf. The hope that prevailed
in the past has gone forever. Failure to free the hostages is a
result of the American heresy, procrastination and reneging on
pledges and promises.
   The only safe way to the freedom of the captives and their safety
is the implementation of our just demands. This is the essential
cornerstone in this issue, nothing else.

   Discouraged workers facing layoffs in less
than a month had their spirits lifted Friday when British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher visited the birthplace of the banned
Solidarity trade union.
   Workers inside pressed against the closed gates of the Lenin
shipyard to get a glimpse of Mrs. Thatcher, the first Western head
of state to travel to Gdansk to meet with Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa.
   ``We love Mrs. Thatcher! We love Mrs. Thatcher!'' shouted the
hard-hatted workers who had climbed atop buildings for a better view
of her placing a wreath at a monument near the gates honoring
workers killed in 1970 food price riots.
   Mrs. Thatcher arrived in the midst of a struggle for the future
of the famous shipyard, where Solidarity sprang to life in August
1980. The government announced it is to be closed beginning Dec. 1.
   ``The shipyard is ours! Lenin is yours!'' the crowd shouted,
referring to the name of the yard. ``Mrs. Thatcher, don't let the
shipyard be closed,'' one banner implored.
   Solidarity has said it will fight the closure, contending the
decision was made for political reasons, not economic ones as the
government says.
   The officially recognized union and management have formed for
the first time a common front with the yard's illegal Solidarity
organization in order to oppose the decision.
   Despite various police barriers, Solidarity supporters were able
to reach the front of the monument for Mrs. Thatcher's visit, mixing
with crowds that had been bused in from official organizations.
Reporters estimated 20,000 people turned out to see her.
   Inside the shipyard, workers climbed on the gates and on the
roofs of administrative buildings in defiance of a warning by strike
committee leader Alojzy Szablewski not to be too aggressive and risk
police response.
   As soon as Mrs. Thatcher emerged from her limousine, the crowd
and the workers began to shout ``Solidarity! Solidarity!'' and
``There is no freedom without Solidarity!''
   Walesa accompanied Mrs. Thatcher to the 130-foot monument
consisting of three soaring steel crosses, which Solidarity erected
in its heyday in 1980 to commemorate the scores of workers killed by
police on the Baltic coast during the 1970 riots.
   Workers went on a rampage in that year after authorities raised
food prices just before Christmas. Security forces answered with
gunfire, killing a still unknown number of people.
   Visibly moved at her reception, Mrs. Thatcher waved to the crowd
around the monument and Walesa helped her mount a small stepladder
so she could reach over a metal barrier and shake hands with a few
of the people.
   The authorities had done their best to spruce up the Baltic port
and discourage unofficial crowds from forming. Streets were washed
Thursday night even though a light snow already had washed away much
of the grime.
   Scores of police trucks and jeeps clogged the narrow side streets
near the monument and hundreds of police patrolled the port. Still
the crowd followed Mrs. Thatcher's car to St. Brygida's church where
she had lunch with Walesa and union leaders.
   ``Solidarity Gdansk welcomes Mrs. Thatcher,'' said a large sign
on the church.
   Spectators said they stood behind Mrs. Thatcher's position on
human rights, but they were less enthusiastic about her attitude
toward trade unions.
   ``She is a courageous woman. She would give us nothing. But we
still have to respect her,'' said one of the workers inside the yard.
   Others admired her firm will, saying her style of leadership was
needed in Poland.
   ``If Poles are wise they will learn a lot from this visit,
because she is the Iron Lady who knows how to govern,'' said Bernard
Kowalewski, an invalid and retiree.
   Mrs. Thatcher got a roar of applause for her short speech of
thanks in St. Brygida's that was carried over loudspeakers.
   After she departed, the crowd tried to march back to the
monument, but police already had sealed off the streets. They
dispersed peacefully after several minutes.

   Deposed Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos
says he feels betrayed by the American system he once admired and
worries more about his place in history than going to jail.
   ``I am not afraid to go to jail,'' Marcos told The Associated
Press in an interview at his home Thursday. ``I would probably be
dead by the time the trial is over. I'm feeling in pain every day.''
   Marcos and his wife, Imelda, were indicted Oct. 21 by a federal
grand jury in New York on criminal racketeering charges accusing
them of plundering more than $100 million from their homeland and
funneling it into Swiss and Hong Kong bank accounts, Manhattan real
estate and fine art.
   Mrs. Marcos pleaded innocent to the charges in New York on
Monday, but her husband's arraignment was delayed pending the report
of a government physician who examined him Monday.
   Defense lawyers contend the 71-year-old Marcos, who remained in a
wheelchair during the interview, is too frail to make the 10-hour
flight to New York and hinted his poor health may cause his trial to
be suspended altogether.
   Marcos, who seemed tired but alert during the interview, said he
would comply with a federal court order requiring him to submit
fingerprints, palm prints and handwriting and voice samples to the
FBI by Wednesday or face contempt charges.
   ``I'll take my destiny, whatever that may be, but I'm going to
fight for my dignity and my honor,'' Marcos said in his first
meeting with the press since being indicted.
   ``They've offered me nothing,'' Marcos said of prosecutors. ``For
guidance, I turn to God. I pray for the best and expect the worst.''
   A staunch U.S. ally during his 20 years in power, Marcos said he
held no animosity toward President Reagan, who once hailed him as a
valuable friend and helped him resettle here, but said he felt
betrayed by the U.S. justice system.
   ``It's nothing personal ... we just feel that the worship of the
Statue of Liberty was misplaced,'' he said. ``We feel betrayed by an
American system that we believed to be fair and just ... now it
seems that is not true.''
   Although the Manhattan grand jury indictment was handed up after
nearly two years of investigation, and grand juries in Honolulu and
Alexandria, Va., are also investigating him, Marcos said he was
confident he would be vindicated.
   ``I don't think they have any evidence,'' said Marcos, offering
the results of past investigations in the United States, the
Philippines and Japan that cleared him of similar charges.
   The interview was held at Marcos' hillside home overlooking
Honolulu as he prepared to leave for an appointment with an eye
doctor. Wearing a dark suit and tie, Marcos greeted a reporter with
a firm handshake and smiled wanly when asked about his health.
   ``I'm tired and in pain, I'm on the way to the doctor right
now,'' he said.
   Since being exiled here in 1986, Marcos has complained of chest
pains that caused his hospitalization, and of an eye ailment and
flare-ups of old war injuries of the leg and the knee.
   During the interview, Marcos' face appeared puffy and his eyes
watery. An aide said early Friday Marcos sought medical help for
severe headaches, which his eye doctor said may be attributed to
deteriorating vision.
   Defense lawyers for Marcos have presented letters from two
Honolulu doctors and Marcos' personal physician, saying Marcos
suffers from an enlarged heart and a thickening of the heart muscle.
   Mrs. Marcos, visiting Thursday at the New Jersey home of tobacco
heiress Doris Duke, who posted her $5 million bail, said her
husband's health was her chief concern.
   ``He is my biggest worry now. His health has been deteriorating
throughout these three years of stress, shock and frustration of an
injustice and a betrayal,'' she told The Star-Ledger of Newark.

   Pop singer Whitney Houston, whose songs have
earned hundreds of millions of dollars, is a hometown girl at heart.
   Ms. Houston, a native of Newark, has decided to help rehabilitate
her birthplace by investing in a $100 million housing development
geared toward low- and middle-income residents, her father and a
city official said Thursday.
   ``Here's a young lady that's become very successful ... and she's
coming back to her roots, to where her heritage is from and she's
saying, `I did not forget you, Newark,''' said Henry Martinez, City
Council president and a supporter of the project.
   He said the council is considering calling the project Houston
Estates.
   ``It's her city,'' said her father and business manager, John
Houston. ``She's concerned. A lot of her friends are there.''
   Also born there were her mother, Cissie Houston, and her cousin,
Dionne Warwick, well-known singers in their own right.
   The project involves rehabilitating old structures and building
new ones on about 180 acres of the east ward of Newark.
   It involves about 2,000 housing units, including 600 to 800 units
to be set aside for low-income renters, senior citizens and
handicapped people. The project also includes recreational and
shopping areas.
   Ms. Houston, 25, might end up paying as much as 40 percent of the
total investment cost, her father said.

   Cathedral bells rang out Friday as Queen
Elizabeth II arrived in this northern city to celebrate the
restoration of York Minster after a devastating fire four years ago.
   The queen participated in a morning service to bless a new roof
over the south transept and the reconstructed 16th-century Rose
Window nearly lost in the blaze begun by lightning on July 9.
   Before an audience of 1,500 in the large, 500-year-old Gothic
cathedral, the queen unveiled a plaque to ``remember with
gratitude'' those who helped in the $5.3 million restoration job.
   Fire at one point had threatened to spread across the building,
but the collapse of the vaulted transept roof onto the stone floor
saved the cathedral from destruction.
   Craftsmen used 160 ancient English oak trees donated from across
the country to build a new carved wooden roof.

   Actor Jim Varney, the long-faced rube who
says ``Hey Vern'' in a variety of television commercials, says he
drew inspiration from Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton.
   ``Physical comedy is a comedy that works in any language, and
Chaplin knew that,'' Varney said in an interview. ``His success was
based on the fact that he never opened his mouth to get a laugh. I
think people like physical comedy, which is why cartoons are so
successful.''
   Varney, portraying rubber-necked Ernest P. Worrell, stars in the
Saturday morning CBS-TV show, ``Hey Vern, It's Ernest!''
   His second movie, ``Ernest Saves Christmas,'' will be released
next weekend. He said the motion picture includes physical comedy
like ``walking into walls and falling off ladders.''
   ``I was inspired a lot by Chaplin and Buster Keaton,'' he said.

   Art Carney, who won three Emmys as Jackie
Gleason's sewer worker buddy in ``The Honeymooners'' and a Best
Actor Oscar for ``Harry and Tonto,'' quietly celebrated his 70th
birthday Friday, a spokesman said.
   ``He's treating it like any other day,'' said the spokesman, who
asked not to be identified because Carney is publicity-shy.
   Carney planned to spend the day quietly with his wife, Jean, at
their Connecticut home, he said.
   Carney rose to fame as Gleason's wisecracking neighbor Ed Norton,
a lovable sewer worker, winning three Emmy awards for the character
in both ``The Jackie Gleason Show'' and ``The Honeymooners'' in the
1950s.
   He continued to work in television and films, winning an Oscar in
1974 for his role as a roving widower traveling with his cat in
``Harry and Tonto.'' Some of his other films included ``A Guide for
the Married Man'' and ``House Calls.''
   Carney recently completed a guest spot on the TV series ``The
Cavanaughs.'' He can also be seen still strutting his Norton swagger
in a current Coca-Cola commercial.

<HEAD>Unemployment Hits 14-Year Low as Economy Rebounds From Summer
Drought</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unemployment fell to 5.3 percent in October _
matching a 14-year low _ the government said Friday, as employers
added 325,000 new jobs and floored the accelerator on an economy
that had been slowed by the summer drought.
   In its last major economic report before Tuesday's presidential
election, the Labor Department said the 0.1 percentage point drop
from September's 5.4 percent jobless rate was accompanied by 99,000
new manufacturing jobs, the biggest monthly increase in that
employment category since February 1984.
   But Janet L. Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor
Statistics, cautioned that the October pickup in factory employment
``may be somewhat overstated'' because of a seasonally adjusted
increase of 25,000 jobs in canneries and other food processing
plants.
   Factory jobs had declined by 45,000 in August and September.
   The Labor Department said there were fewer fall cutbacks than
usual in food industry employment ``following light summer hiring
due to the drought.''
   But even discounting all of the seasonal gain there, payroll
growth in October returned to the 300,000 monthly rate it had
averaged in 1986, 1987 and the first seven months of this year after
falling to 240,000 new jobs monthly in August and September.
   The 5.3 percent jobless rate in October matched June's rate as
the lowest since May 1974.
   ``The future is bright and it's getting brighter,'' President
Reagan said of the figures as he was leaving the White House to
campaign for Vice President George Bush. ``Nothing's going to stop
us now.''
   Private political and economic analysts agreed.
   Only a dramatic change in the employment numbers ``indicating
some fantastic failure or crisis'' could have helped Democratic
nominee Michael Dukakis, said Richard Brody, a political science
professor at Stanford University.
   Instead, economists said, the October job numbers foretell an
economy returning to a growth rate of 3 percent or more annually in
the fourth quarter after it slowed to 2.2 percent over the summer.
   ``A good case is developing that the fourth quarter will show
stronger growth than the third,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, chief
economist for the National Association of Manufacturers.
   Jasinowski said companies are telling him that their factory
orders, which fell 1.9 percent in September, according to the
government, bounced back again last month.
   The manufacturing employment gains plus figures in Friday's job
market report showing that assembly line workers continued to work
on average 4 hours of overtime each week last month buttress that
scenario.
   The slowdown in growth over the summer was more ``drought-related
than most people believed,'' Jasinowski said. ``It was the most
extraordinary summer in decades and it did slow the pace of things a
bit more than the government's seasonal adjustments did.''
   William Dunkelberg, an economics professor at Temple University
who surveys small businesses, said an ``expansion-high'' 25 percent
of small businesses reported unfilled job openings in October.
   ``Capital spending is on a tear'' with 34 percent of small
businesses planning to make new capital expenditures in the next six
months, Dunkelberg said. ``Even if you go back to the late 1970s you
don't get numbers that good. The unemployment rate is more likely to
keep going down rather than up.''
   ``Absent the effects of the drought and with all this capital
spending going on, the first half of 1989 is going to be very
strong,'' he added. ``It's hard to see how you're going to get into
a recession until 1990.''
   Ms. Norwood told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress there
are now 422,000 more factory jobs than there were a year ago, even
though the net increase over the past three months amounts to only
54,000.
   Manufacturing industries other than food processing, including
lumber and wood products, steel and aluminum, machinery, motor
vehicles, and rubber and plastics, showed significant gains in
October.
   Retail trade and health services, with 50,000 and 47,000 new
jobs, respectively, paced a payroll increase of 231,000 in October
on the services side of the economy.
   However, department store employment fell for the fourth month in
a row. Economists viewed that as a healthy omen that consumer
spending may be slowing, relieving some inflationary pressure, while
savings are rising to fuel even more capital investment for
productivity improvements.
   ``My feeling is that the economy, real GNP (uninflated gross
national product), is growing by 3 percent and that inflation will
stay around 4 percent,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief economist for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Friday's employment figures sent both bond and stock prices down
as investors gave up hopes that the Federal Reserve Board would
reduce interest rates after the election, analysts said.
   ``There's no chance of that now,'' Yardeni said. ``But, at the
same time, I don't think that the Fed is going to tighten either.''
   Analysts also attributed the decline in stock and bond prices to
a recurring fear on Wall Street that continued falling unemployment
is going to push up wages and ignite inflation.
   Friday's report showed average hourly earnings rising 5 cents
last month to $9.49, an increase of 3.8 percent over the past 12
months. In terms of purchasing power, however, those wages were
buying 1 percent less than they had a year earlier, the government
said.

   Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd
Bentsen on Friday visited a science program founded after the
explosion of the space shuttle Challenger to highlight the
Democratic ticket's commitment to the space program.
   But Bentsen, the man Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis has said
would head a new cabinet-level council on space, incorrectly told an
audience of school children that the next shuttle mission would be
unmanned.
   Bentsen was campaigning in Houston on his way to California, with
a stop in New Mexico en route.
   Space is big business in Texas, where the Democrats still hope to
pick up 29 electoral votes.
   The Texas senator toured the Challenger Center at the Houston
Museum of Natural Science. The center was founded, in the wake of
the Challenger tragedy that claimed the lives of its seven-member
crew, to boost interest in science and technology among the young.
   Bentsen stopped first at a mock space station to watch fourth
graders operate robots, and work on a science project with special
gloves mounted through a transparent panel.
   In a rare instance where the ``character'' issue could be
scientifically measured, a girl held wires to Bentsen's finger to
measure the electric activity on his skin, in what was explained to
be a stress test. He measured only 1.6 on a scale where five is
normal.
   ``That means I'm cool,'' Bentsen concluded.
   Afterward, in the museum auditorium, Bentsen took questions from
an audience of school children who seemed most interested in whether
he was having a good time.
   ``How did you get to be vice president,'' one asked.
   ``I haven't done it yet,'' he answered.
   ``Is if fun to be a vice president?'' said another.
   ``I don't know yet,'' he replied. ``I'll tell you, I've had fun
running for vice president.''
   Explaining the progress of the space shuttle program, he said,
``They tell me that later this month we're going to put another one
up in space called Atlantis,'' he said. ``But that not going to have
any people on it.''
   Actually, the Atlantis will carry a crew of five on its
classified military mission. The next unmanned shuttle mission will
be launched by the Soviets.
   Bentsen's press secretary, Mike McCurry, said the error was on a
briefing paper given to Bentsen just before the event. The Texas
senator was unsure if the information was correct, but referred to
it anyway, McCurry said.
   Bentsen took a poll of the children, and about half said they
wanted to be astronauts. He told them other jobs would be good too,
including public service.
   He told them to tell their parents to vote next Tuesday. ``They
must go and be part of it,'' he said.
   The kids raised their hands to indicate they would tell their
folks to go to the polls, including Bentsen's grandson, Lloyd M.
Bentsen IV.
   ``You're going to do that too? That's good,'' said Lloyd M.
Bentsen Jr.

<TEXT>
   French President Francois Mitterrand
and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl met Friday for talks that
focused on developing common policies toward the Soviet Union.
   At a joint news conference, Kohl told reporters he briefed
Mitterrand on his meetings with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev in September in Moscow. Mitterrand is scheduled to visit
Moscow later this month.
   Kohl said earlier this week that the two countries should work
together to develop a ``joint European policy'' toward the Soviet
bloc because of ``new developments in the East ... that are filling
us with hope.''
   On Friday, the second day of the 52nd summit between a French and
West German leader, Mitterrand characterized relations between the
two nations as ``good and healthy.''
   Kohl said the two leaders also discussed preparations for an
upcoming meeting of European Economic Community leaders on the Greek
island of Rhodes.
   Kohl assured Mitterrand of his government's support for French
efforts to reduce its trade deficit, Ost said. He said West German
advisers will help in these efforts, but did not elaborate.
   Kohl said his country and France also are planning a joint
military brigade, which should be in place in two years.
   The West German chancellor also held talks with French Premier
Michel Rocard.
   The two men discussed obstacles that remain to the EEC plan to
remove trade barriers among its member countries by 1992, as well as
environmental protection and cooperation in high-technology, Ost
said.
   West German Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer said Friday that
an agreement had been reached to set up a joint environmental
advisory council.

<HEAD>Bush: `It's Wrong' for Associates to Try to Use Political
Connections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush said Friday ``I
think it's wrong'' that a consulting firm run by a long-time
associate used its political connections to try to drum up new
business.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Bush also said he is
weary of campaigning and would rather be home playing horseshoes but
denied that Americans are turned off by negative campaigning.
   ``The idea that this campaign is so different from others _ I
don't believe it. I don't think the American people believe it, all
this stuff about being turned off. You can always go out and find
people to say that. Our people don't say that when I get off this
airplane,'' Bush said in an interview aboard Air Force Two.
   Bush expressed dismay at the disclosure that a consulting firm
headed by Frederick M. Bush (no relation) had sought business with
the new government of Haiti citing its ability to influence a new
GOP administration.
   ``I denounce it, I don't like it, I think it's wrong,'' the vice
president said.
   Frederick Bush also disavowed the effort, saying it had been
initiated without his knowledge by his partner, Michael Govan.
   Asked how Frederick Bush could have allowed it to happen, George
Bush said: ``Ask him how he could allow it to happen.''
   ``How could the chief education adviser to Mr. Dukakis end up in
jail?'' he added, referring to Gerald Indelicato, convicted in July
of skimming money from an adult education program he ran.
   Bush said the lobbying episode should not be taken as an
indication of things to come if he is elected. Voters, he said,
``know I've been in public life for 20 years, and no one has ever
made any allegations about impropriety on my part because they know
how strongly I feel about ethics in government.''
   The vice president has said he would establish an ethics office
in the White House if elected.
   At rallies on Friday, Bush attacked rival Michael Dukakis'
handling of Massachusetts' fiscal management and suggested that the
Democrat might have to seek another tax increase to finance the
state's budget shortfall.
   At a speech at Fairfield University in Stamford and at a rainy
downtown rally here, Bush held aloft a copy of the Boston Herald,
whose front-page headline read: ``What a Mess'' in referring to the
state's budget crisis.
   In the AP interview, Bush said he expected his gesture would get
more attention than just talking about the issues.
   ``This man has been claiming there is a miracle in Massachusetts.
I have to hold up a little graphic to get peoples' attention. ... I
think that's fair, it's factual. ... It's a little shot people can
see. Does that mean I shouldn't do it? Not as long as it's accurate,
and it is. So I don't have any regrets about it.''
   The vice president, interviewed on his plane between events in
Connecticut and Ohio, dismissed suggestions that his campaign was
easing off in anticipation of victory.
   ``We can't do any more, we just can't,'' Bush said, claiming he
was still waging an exhausting campaign. He said he'd ``rather be
home more. Play horsehoes. ... I get tired. You know, we've been
doing this a long time.''
   ``But it's important to do,'' he added. ``And you learn. I'll be
a better president because I've done that (campaigning).''
   Bush said he was ``real proud'' of the way his campaign has been
conducted with the election now only four days off.
   ``I can only hark back to when (the news media) were writing
entirely different views of my chances and my character and where I
stood. I think it's dramatically changed.''
   ``I'm just going to keep on going'' until Election Day, Bush
said. ``I'm reasonably upbeat but not overconfident.''
   Also in the AP interview, Bush said:
   _ If elected, he would support a free trade pact with Mexico
similar to the one recently negotiated with Canada, calling Mexico
``a very good place for the next major step of that nature.'' But he
said he opposes such an arrangement at this time with Japan.
   ``Japan is a little more complicated and I would have to be
satisfied that _ going that route, that we had total access to the
Japanese markets,'' Bush said.
   _ Predicted a surprise of next Tuesday's election might be
stronger-than-expected support for him from young blacks and
Hispanics he said were disenchanted with the Democratic Party
because of its treatment of Jesse Jackson. ``I think they feel
they've been taken for granted,'' he said.
   Asked why he wasn't spending more time campaigning in areas where
blacks and other minorities live, Bush said, ``Historically, I think
everybody knows this is a very difficult area for Republicans to get
a lot of votes. And I'm trying to get a lot of votes.''
   _ Praised Friday's unemployent figures showing the jobless rate
to have dropped to 5.3 percent, a 14-year low.
   He said it was further evidence that a recession is not at hand.
And, Bush added, ``If my programs are adopted, that would be a very
good guarantee there wouldn't be a recession.''

<HEAD>UN Chief Says Iran-Iraq Talks `Extremely Useful'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar on
Friday met separately with the foreign ministers of Iran and Iraq
for U.N.-mediated peace talks and said they were ``extremely useful
discussions.''
   The separate meetings follow a face-to-face session of technical
experts of both countries Thursday which he praised for doing ``some
excellent work in terms of clarification'' of details.
   Perez de Cuellar did not elaborate on his talks with Iran's Ali
Akbar Velayati and Iraq's Tariq Aziz, nor on the work of the experts.
   He said he planned to return to New York on Monday.
   A joint plenary session with both ministers and their delegations
was set for Saturday. The session to consolidate the fragile truce
in the 8-year-old war is the third since the talks went into their
third round last Monday.
   The talks still are bogged down over the question of the common
border. Point one of the 10-point U.N. cease-fire resolution calls
for the withdrawal of forces to ``internationally recognized
borders.''
   Both sides claim patches of their territory still are occupied.
   Aziz told reporters his talk with the U.N. chief was
``constructive as usual.''
   Velayati said discussions focused on a U.N. compromise proposal
to break a deadlock in negotiations that started Aug. 25, five days
after the U.N.-brokered cease-fire.
   That plan links troop withdrawal and the exchange of an estimated
100,000 prisoners to Iranian assurances to cease searching ships in
the Persian Gulf for war-related cargo and to the dredging of the
Shatt-Al-Arab.
   The waterway, called the Arvand river by the Iranians, is blocked
by ships stranded by the war, unexploded shells and silt. It is
Iraq's only navigable outlet to the gulf.
   The waterway is also the most contentious issue between the two
states because Iraq in 1980 repudiated a 5-year-old treaty that set
the border down the middle of the Shatt. Iraq wants to regain full
sovereignty, moving the border back to the Iranian shore where it
was before 1975.
   Iranian and Iraqi experts Friday also had separate meetings with
officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross to discuss
repatriating prisoners of war.
   A Foreign Ministry legal expert from Iraq later repeated to
reporters his country's rejection of Iran's insistence that an
exchange of all POWs go hand-in-hand with a troop withdrawal, as
provided by the U.N. resolution.
   Ryad El-Kaisy called the Iranian argument fallacious and strange.
   Iraq maintains that a prisoner exchange could take place
immediately under the Geneva conventions, which say a prisoner
exchange should come after the cessation of hostilities.
   The Iranian side made no comment after its meeting.

<HEAD>East Germany Grants Permission For Mormon Missionaries</HEAD>

   East Germany has granted the Mormon Church
permission to conduct missionary work within the Soviet Bloc country
and will allow converts to serve missions outside the border, the
church said Friday.
   Thomas S. Monson, second counselor to Mormon Church President
Ezra Taft Benson, recently returned from meetings in East Berlin
with top German Democratic Republic officials, including Erich
Honecker, chairman of the State Council, and State Secretary of
Religious Affairs Kurt Loeffler.
   ``Both Chairman Honecker and Mr. Loeffler agreed that allowing
missionaries from other countries to serve (in East Germany) and
permitting Latter-day Saints from (the GDR) to serve as missionaries
in other countries will strengthen friendships among nations,''
Monson said.
   Monson said the principles of the church-state agreement were
reached last week. Details will be worked out in further meetings
next month between European Mormon officials and Loeffler's office.
   ``The government has also granted our members the right to use
various facilities for youth conferences and other church
meetings,'' Monson said.
   Loeffler indicated that Mormons have the communist government's
respect because they are ``law-abiding, loyal citizens who believe
in strong families, have a strong work ethic and support the desire
for world peace,'' Monson said.

   Here are excerpts from the remarks of
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the Democratic presidential
nominee, at a rally Friday in the Forest Hills section of New York
City:
   ``I like your spirit and I think we're going to win on the 8th of
November, don't you. ... Look at the diversity around us. ... Only
in the Democratic Party could this happen, a son of immigrants the
nominee of his party.
   ... I know the Republicans were celebrating a little prematurely
a couple of weeks ago, popping those champagne corks in their
penthouses. ... We're the ones who are going to be celebrating.
   ... I think Mr. Bush is coasting, we're fighting back all across
the country. He's slipping; we're surging.
   He thinks you can inherit the White House, I think you've got to
earn the right to be president of the United States.
   ... (Republicans) want the American people to forget that they
stole from our children in piling up the biggest debt in history.
... They stole from our future by trashing our environment.
   ... Yesterday, if you can believe this, Mr. Bush took a furlough
from the truth by saying that he was on the side of working American
families, can you believe that. Four days before the election, after
all the symbols and slogans, four days before the election he tells
you he's on your side. Who's he kidding.
   ... 28 years ago, another son of Massaschusetts challenged us to
win the race to the moon and we did. As president, I want to
challenge the people of American to one fundamental goal: drug free
schools in the 1990s.
   ... I'll be damned if I'm going to let them send that stuff into
our country and poison our kids and destroy our neighborhoods.
   ... This election is about the future. It's about our children
and our grandchildren. It's about our neighborhoods and communities.
... and yes, it's about the Supreme Court and who the next
president's going to appoint.
   ... We have four days to go and much to go and remember, the best
American is not behind us, the best America is yet to come.

   Robbie Chaney had to bare his belly in
court before he was convicted of aggravated robbery.
   A Ross County common pleas court jury looked at his stomach and
agreed Thursday it went with the man who walked into a fast food
restaurant Aug. 17 and demanded money.
   The exposure was important because the man who tried to rob the
restaurant had his shirt pulled up and over his head, exposing his
midsection.
   Restaurant worker Sherry Arledge told the court that shortly
before the robbery she refused to serve a shirtless man. During the
attempted stick-up, she said, she recognized the man's stomach as
that of the shirtless man. She later identified that man as Chaney.
   Chaney, 29, of Chillicothe, faces five to 25 years for aggravated
robbery when he sentenced Dec. 12.

<HEAD>Soviets Suspend Withdrawal, Send More Weapons to Afghanistan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union said Friday it has suspended
military withdrawal from Afghanistan and sent in sophisticated
weapons because of unrelenting pressure from Moslem guerrillas.
   Witnesses have reported MiG-27 ground-attack jets and SS-1 Scud
missiles in Afghanistan.
   Alexander Bessmertnykh, first deputy foreign minister, repeated
Soviet accusations that the United States and Pakistan violate the
withdrawal agreement by sending a constant flow of arms to the
insurgents.
   ``The Soviet troops are being withdrawn due to the good will of
the Soviet government,'' Bessmertnykh told a news briefing. ``They
will be withdrawn in honorable conditions.''
   He said an atmosphere of bombing, mortar and rocket attacks on
civilians, government soldiers and the departing Soviet forces
``does not provide the conditions for such a withdrawal of Soviet
troops,'' and declared: ``The withdrawal of the troops is being
suspended.''
   His comments reflected Soviet frustration over how the Afghan
army has handled the fight in the nearly three months since the Red
Army reached the halfway point in withdrawning its estimated 115,000
men.
   Bessmertnykh also appeared to indicate the withdrawal might not
be completed by the Feb. 15 deadline set in the April 14 Geneva
agreement mediated by the United Nations. The withdrawal began May
15.
   While reiterating Soviet commitment to the agreement, he said:
``If none of the countries violate the accords, they would be
fulfilled by the Soviet Union.''
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
Soviet action ``can only increase tensions in the region and raise
speculation that they aren't going to live up to the Geneva
accords.''
   President Reagan was asked about Bessmertnykh's comments and
replied: ``I think we are all disappointed by that. At the same
time, I think we should recognize that this is something they have
said is necessary and they have repledged to bring the troops out by
Feb. 15.''
   When asked whether the United States planned steps in response,
he said, ``We haven't had a chance to sit down and talk it over.''
   Soviet officials have repeatedly threatened the guerrillas and
their supporters with serious consequences but have not been
specific.
   Half the Soviet forces were withdrawn by Aug. 15 under terms of
the Geneva agreement signed by Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Soviet
Union and United States. The insurgents were not parties to the
negotitions and continued the war.
   Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in April
1978 and Soviet military forces entered the country in December
1979. More than 5 million Afghans fled, most of them to border
cities and refugee camps in Pakistan that have served as bases and
supply points for the insurgents.
   Soviet generals say more than 13,000 of their soldiers were
killed and 35,000 wounded.
   A pause in the Soviet withdrawal has been evident since Aug. 15,
so the immediate effect of Bessmertnykh's announcement was not
clear. A senior Reagan administration official said privately in
Washington the Soviets had discussed renewing the pullout Nov. 15.
   Bessmertnykh said Friday: ``What is important is not the date at
which the withdrawal will be continued but when it will be
completed.''
   He said the insurgents get a steady ``flow of armaments of U.S.
and other origins,'' in violation of provisions in the Geneva
agreement against non-interference in Afghan affairs.
   New troops are being rotated into Afghanistan with more
sophisiticated arms and ``the Soviet Union is now delivering to the
military forces of Afghanistan additional and more powerful means of
destruction,'' he said.
   Bessmertnykh added, however, that the number of weapons and
soldiers is not increasing and Soviet personnel do not participate
in attacks on guerrillas.
   Soviet soldiers have been subjected to 555 shelling attacks,
including 88 with rockets and mortars, he said, and Soviet outposts
have come under attack 400 times. Bessmertnykh said the Soviet
forces had suffered casualties, but he would not say how many.
   Insurgent attacks killed 230 civilians in October, Bessmertnykh
said.
   Witnesses said earlier this week they saw MiG-27s attacking
guerrilla positions near the southern city of Kandahar, and Scud
missiles were seen in Kabul for the first time.
   Scuds have a maximum range of about 180 miles and are intended
for use against ``concentrations of hardware and arms used against
Soviet military units and towns in Afghanistan,'' not against
Pakistan, Bessmertnykh said.
   A senior Western diplomat in Moscow said privately: ``It is
difficult to win a war against guerrillas with ground-to-ground
missiles, long-range bombers or even ground-attack aircraft based
close by. Some of what is happening is intended to convey a
political message than achieve a military objective.''

   Final election results issued Friday gave
Yitzhak Shamir's Likud bloc 40 parliament seats and the prime
minister pressed ahead to form a majority coalition with rightist
and religious parties.
   His aides brushed aside calls for a new version of the 4-year-old
``national unity'' coalition with the center-left Labor Party of
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, which won 39 of the 120 Knesset
seats. The fractious Likud-Labor arrangement was made after the
indecisive 1984 election.
   Al Fajr, a newspaper that supports the Palestine Liberation
Organization, published a draft declaration of independence for a
Palestinian state in the occupied territories, which is expected to
be approved at a meeting later this month of the Palestine National
Council, the PLO legislature.
   How to make peace with the Arabs and end the 11-month-old
rebellion among the 1.5 million Palestinians of the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip were the focus of Tuesday's election, in which
the conservative religious parties gained strength.
   Palestinians say the draft declaration is a step toward peace
because it implicity recognizes Israel's right to exist. Avi Pazner,
a Shamir aide, discounted the document and said: ``We are not asking
the PLO to recognize Israel and we will not give them anything.''
   Shamir opposes giving up land captured in the 1967 war, favors
building more Jewish settlements in occupied territory and rejects
an intrernational conference on Middle East peace demanded by the
Arabs. Labor supports both a conference and trading some land for
peace.
   Israeli soldiers shot and wounded 18 Palestinians Friday in the
West Bank Gaza, Arab hospital officials reported.
   Since the uprising began Dec. 8, 1987, more than 300 Palestinans
and 10 Israelis have been killed. At least 7,000 Palestinians have
been wounded.
   Traditionally, Israel's president asks the leader of the largest
party in the Knesset to form a government. Shamir has held
preliminary coalition talks with four religious and three far-right
parties that won a total of 25 seats. Likud must add 21 seats to its
own 40 to obtain a majority.
   Peres also courted the religous parties, but his chances of
forming a majority are seen as slim. Some in his party said he
should end negotiations and accept an opposition role because
competition for support of the religious parties strengthens their
bargaining position without benefiting Labor.
   Among the demands of religious parties, which have a total of 18
Knesset seats, are changes in the law defining who is a Jew for the
purposes of granting automatic citizenship, and banning driving,
movies and soccer games on the sabbath.
   A Likud member of the Cabinet, Moshe Katzav, also expressed
concern about religious pressure.
   ``The religious are presenting many demands and difficult
conditions,'' the newspaper Hadashot quoted him as saying. ``We will
not be able to respond to them all.''
   Katzav raised the prospect of inviting Labor into a Likud
government as a junior partner to weaken reduce the clout of
religious parties, but said Labor would have to drop its support of
an international peace conference.
   Peres appeared to dismiss the possibility of another coalition
with Likud. ``We will not join any government that has no peace
plan,'' he said on Israel radio.
   Pazner, the Shamir aide, said such a government ``is not
something realistic right now. Labor would not agree to join as a
junior partner.''
   A poll published in the daily Maariv indicated 65 percent of
Israelis opposed another ``national unity'' government and 60
percent were concerned about the rising power of the Orthodox
religious.
   Al Fajr's report said the Palestinian declaration of independence
will be presented to the Palestine National Council on Nov. 14. It
calls for a Palestinian stat based on U.N. Security Resolution 181
of 1947, which calls for both a Jewish and an Arab state.
   Israel rejects the 1947 partition plan, which gives the occupied
lands and key areas of what is now Israel to the Palestinians. The
plan also calls for international control of Jerusalem, which Israel
has annexed and declared to be its capital.

   Prosecutors ordered the arrest of a man
convicted of Nazi war crimes by the Soviet Union after they learned
through news reports he had fled to West Germany from the United
States, a prosecutor said Friday.
   Boleslav Maikovskis is in investigative custody in a prison in
Bochum, although no charges have been filed in West Germany.
   ``We heard the news reports on the weekend, and the investigation
was started the next Monday,'' said Klaus Schacht, the Dortmund war
crimes prosecutor handling the West German investigation of
Maikovskis.
   ``Until then, we didn't know he was here,'' Schacht told The
Associated Press in a telephone interview.
   Maikovskis, 84, was picked up at his Muenster apartment on Oct.
19, two days after the investigation began, Schacht said. He had
lived in Mineola, N.Y., and West German authorities say he came here
in November 1987.
   The Soviet Union in 1965 sentenced Maikovskis to death in
absentia for his role in burning down a village and participating in
the murder of more than 130 men, women and children in his native
Latvia. The charges say the deaths occurred while he commanded a
pro-Nazi police force during World War II.
   On Thursday, West German officials defended issuing an entry visa
to Maikovskis, saying he had valid travel documents and had not been
charged in the United States. Bonn officials said the visa was
issued for a three-month stay to allow Maikovskis to pursue legal
matters.
   He also applied for political asylum in West Germany, which
allowed him to remain here while the case was pending.
   Last month, the U.S. Justice Department's Office of Special
Investigations said it had lost track of Maikovskis and had just
discovered he left the country.
   The United States began trying to deport him in 1976, but the
case was delayed by several appeals. His latest appeal was denied by
the U.S. Supreme Court in 1986.
   West German officials have said they would consider extraditing
Maikovskis to the Soviet Union if it waives the death penalty.

<TEXT>
   An estimated 20,000 Poles gave a tumultuous
and emotional welcome Friday to British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, who met Lech Walesa at the doomed Lenin shipyard and said
she felt ``the spirit of Poland.''
   Crowds shouted slogans against communism and Poland's premier as
Mrs. Thatcher _ the first Western leader to meet Walesa at the
shipyard _ came to Gdansk after telling the government it must
negotiate with the banned trade union Solidarity before it can
receive long-term Western aid.
   Mrs. Thatcher later returned to Warsaw for a final round of talks
with Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski at the end of a
three-day visit. She then boarded a Royal Air Force jet for London.
   Her emotional reception in Gdansk was heightened by her tough
attitude to Jaruzelski and by the government's annnouncement this
week that it will close the Lenin shipyard, the birthplace of
Solidarity, on Dec. 1 as part of an economic austerity program.
   ``I came to see and to have a long talk with Mr. Walesa. ... I
knew that I had to come and feel the spirit of Poland for myself,''
said Mrs. Thatcher, referring to the port city of Gdansk that is the
heartland for the long struggle by workers for a free trade union.
   At a farewell news conference, Mrs. Thatcher said if the
government recognizes Solidarity, Britain will respond. ``We shall
not be found wanting when Poland makes the progress toward freedom
and democracy its people clearly seek,'' she said.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said officials were not
convinced. ``We are skeptical of such attempts to define conditions,
and of such promises,'' he said.
   Polish leaders have told Mrs. Thatcher the country is crippled by
a $39 billion foreign debt, but she has said Poland must show
evidence of real economic and political reform before it gets more
aid.
   Shipyard workers in hardhats climbed on surrounding rooftops and
crowds burst into deafening chants of ``Solidarity! Solidarity!'' as
Mrs. Thatcher laid a wreath with Walesa at a towering monument to
scores of workers slain here in 1970 price riots.
   As security police trucks ringed surrounding streets, Mrs.
Thatcher had lunch with Walesa, his Roman Catholic confessor the
Rev. Henryk Jankowski, and 14 other leaders of the union at St.
Brygida's Parish Church near the shipyard.
   Crowds poured into the streets around the church and shipyard and
shouted, ``Viva Thatcher!'' to the British leader who has curbed the
power of trade unions in her own country.
   At the shipyard and monument, a section of the crowd yelled
``Down with Communism!'' and ``Out with Rakowski!'' _ the new Polish
premier Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, who announced the closing of the
yard Monday.
   Walesa said security police tried to stop the crowds by clogging
streets with police trucks and stopping Solidarity leaders from
getting to the monument until shortly before Mrs. Thatcher arrived.
   ``See how many came despite the efforts to stop them,'' said
Walesa. ``They have filtered through somehow. We will not be
defeated.''
   At a service in St. Brygida's after lunch, the high red-bricked
church and its nearby streets echoed with chants of Solidarity
supporters.
   With Walesa standing beside her in the sacristy, his arm raised
in a V-for-victory sign, against a background of red, white and gold
Solidarity banners, Mrs. Thatcher was visibly moved as the
congregation broke into a traditional national hymn, ``God Watches
Over Poland.''
   ``Thank you for coming out and giving me and everything I believe
in such a warm welcome,'' said Mrs. Thatcher, her eyes glistening.
   A British official, who declined to be identified by name, said
that at the lunch in the rectory _ with the priest's bedroom turned
into a bar _ Walesa and Mrs. Thatcher joked often in between serious
political discussion.
   And at the end, she wished him success in his ``historic
endeavors,'' the official said.
   Before the meeting with Walesa, Mrs. Thatcher visited the
Westerplatte monument on the bay of Gdansk, scene of the first shots
of World War II, accompanied by Jaruzelski. The solemn wreath-laying
ceremony recalled the Polish-British wartime alliance.
   Mrs. Thatcher's evident doubts about the pace of reforms by
Jaruzelski and government attempts at setting up talks on Poland's
future, her public support for Solidarity and her huge welcome in
Gdansk cast doubts over the success of the visit for her communist
hosts.
   Official media in Poland gave the visit heavy coverage, but
pointedly omitted any mention of Mrs. Thatcher's contacts with
Walesa on the national TV news Friday night.
   At a state banquet Thursday night she told Jaruzelski that it was
vital he negotiate with oppostion groups including Solidarity.
   The Solidarity leadership responded with gratitude.
   ``It was beautiful what she said,'' said historian Bronislaw
Geremek, one of Walesa's closest advisers. ``For this speech Mrs.
Thatcher gets a great deal of thanks from us.''

   An opposition lawmaker resigned Friday in a
burgeoning stock scandal that reaches as high as Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita and taints others in the governing party.
   Takumi Ueda became the first politician to give up his seat in
the Japanese Diet, or parliament, because of the scandal. His
resignation increases pressure on implicated leaders of the
governing Liberal Democratic Party, including former Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone. He led the government when the stock profiteering
took place in 1986.
   The affair involves top ruling and opposition party members who
purchased unlisted shares of Recruit Cosmos Co., a real estate firm.
They reaped massive profits after they began trading them publicly
in October 1986.
   ``I accept responsibility, resign from my parliamentary seat and
apologize deeply to the people,'' said Ueda of the leading
opposition group, the Japan Socialist Party.
   He is the 15th legislator linked to the scandal, including
Takeshita and Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party.
   Ueda's party has led opposition parties in demanding a
parliamentary investigation of the scandal despite reluctance by the
governing party.
   Ueda, like many others implicated, denied knowledge of the
transaction in which a former aide was said to have used his name to
purchase 5,000 shares in September 1986, just one month before they
were listed on the over-the-counter market in Tokyo.
   In Japan, public share offers usually rise substantially in the
first few days after trading begins. People can be legally invited
to purchase pre-listed shares and often make hefty profits.
   The government has said the trading of the shares was legal under
Japanese securities laws, but opposition parties have raised ethical
questions anyway.
   Socialist Party Chairwoman Takako Doi hailed Ueda's decision to
resign and described the Recruit scandal as ``worse than the
Lockheed scandal'' in which the U.S. Lockheed Corp. allegedly gave
millions of dollars in bribes to Japanese politicians for aircraft
sales.
   The Lockheed scandal broke in February 1976 and led to the
conviction of former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka.

<HEAD>Quayle Says Massachusetts' Financial Woes Show Dukakis Unable to
Manage</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sen. Dan Quayle on Friday cited a nearly $190
million overdraft in Massachusetts current bank account as evidence
that Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis is ill-equipped
to manage the federal government.
   Campaigning for support in Louisiana, where the energy industry
has been beset by hard times in recent years, Quayle pounced on the
revelation that Massachusetts tax receipts had fallen considerably
below expectations, causing the multimillion-dollar shortfall.
   ``We thought it was bad when Massachusetts had to borrow another
$600 million in the first months of the fiscal year just to stay
afloat,'' the Republican vice presidential candidate told a
flag-waving crowd gathered in a park here.
   Quayle said that ``despite the totally false denials made by
Governor Dukakis in his last debate with George Bush, we knew the
fiscal situation was bad.''
   ``The American people are not only just beginning to find out how
bad it really is, but they are finding, as we are, that the fiscal
situation in Massachusetts is a time bomb set to explode in the
faces of its citizens,'' he said.
   Dukakis, questioned about the state's fiscal problems, told
reporters at New York's LaGuardia Airport: ``We don't have deficit.
What we have is 10 balanced budgets in a row.''
   Quayle delivered the broadside a day after accusing Dukakis of
making ``phony'' tough statements about cracking down on drug
abusers, saying the government had been disengenous because Dukakis
opposes such anti-crime measures as capital punishment for drug
kingpins and mandatory prison sentences for drug-related felonies.
   ``This week, the citizens of Massachusets awoke to find out that
their state's bank accounts have been overdrawn up to $190 million
for the past 30 days,'' he said. ``So it turns out that Governor
Dukakis has been writing hot checks to keep his state's finances
afloat.''
   The state constitution of Massachusetts requires a balanced
budget. But the amount of tax receipts coming into the state's
coffers have been considerably less than anticipated by the office
of state treasurer Robert Crane. Consequently, the balance in the
current accounts fell into arrears by nearly $190 million.
   Governors faced with less than expected state tax revenues often
issue what are called revenue anticipation bonds _ meaning they
borrow money against revenues they expect to come in subsequently
and thus close such gaps in bank accounts.
   But in the Massachusetts situation, state officials evidently
opted to pay the interest on the $190 million overdraft rather than
face a higher prevailing interest rate on the floating of such bonds.
   The state has over $1 billion in separate accounts, but these
monies are untouchable; they involve funds raised through other bond
issues for such things as highway and capital improvement projects.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the Democratic vice presidential candidate,
had used a ``hot checks'' charge against Quayle during their Oct. 13
debate in Omaha, Neb., saying the Reagan administration had allowed
the federal budget to fall more than $200 billion in arrears.
   ``You know, if you let me write $200 billion worth of hot checks
every year I could give you an illusion of prosperity, too,'' he
told Quayle.
   Under the Reagan administration the federal debt has more than
tripled, to more than $2.63 trillion.
   Quayle said that Dukakis ``likes to talk about a Massachusetts
miracle. But the only miracle involving Massachusetts will be the
one he needs to get out of the mess he's created for his state.''
   En route to the airport from the Louisiana rally Quayle stopped
at a predominantly black elementary school and visited with several
children, engaging in light banter and talking about opportunities
for Americans under Republican rule.
   He was traveling on to Alabama later to address a rally on the
campus of Auburn University before returning to Washington. Quayle
will make campaign appearances Saturday in Maryland and West
Virginia but no schedule had been announced for Sunday.

<TEXT>
   Cambodia's Prince Norodom Sihanouk and
Vietnamese-backed Prime Minister Hun Sen meet in France next week to
try to agree on how to organize a future Cambodia without the Khmer
Rouge.
   Main absentees at the new talks, scheduled for Monday in
Fere-en-Tardenois, 70 miles northeast of Paris, will be the Khmer
Rouge. The movement caused the deaths of a quarter of Cambodia's 8
million people in an agrarian form of communist revolution that
began 1975.
   In 1978, Vietnam invaded Cambodia and ousted the Khmer Rouge.
   The Sihanouk-Hun Sen meeting, the third of its kind here in the
past year, was to begin Saturday in Paris. Hun Sen asked for the
delay, according to a spokesman for Sihanouk who volunteered no
reasons.
   The non-communist international community refuses to recognize
the Vietamese-backed regime that has run Cambodia for 10 years.
   But Sihanouk, who ruled 1941-1970, has made little headway in
arranging an acceptable coalition excluding the Khmer Rouge. He has
resigned ``once and for all'' as leader of the anti-Vietnamese
coalition because it included a Khmer Rouge element.
   The Hun Sen regime has the backing of the Soviet Union while the
Khmer Rouge _ the biggest and most effective force fighting the
Vietnamese _ retain the backing of China.
   Hun Sen and Sihanouk first met in Fere-en-Tardenois last December
and in St.Germain-en-Laye in the New Year. They came ``closer than
ever to agreement,'' said Son Sann, prime minister in Sihanouk's
resistance government.
   In reality the three parties remain far apart. Not even a meeting
between high-level Chinese and Russian diplomats broke the deadlock.
   Sihanouk has met most Western leaders, including President
Reagan, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and French
President Francois Mitterrand. They see in him the main hope for
agreement on an acceptable Cambodian government, which he would lead.
   Sihanouk is demanding the Hun Sen government step down before
free elections, while Hun Sen wants the elections to come before any
change to his regime. Neither side has realistically tackled the
Khmer Rouge problem.
   The Khmer Rouge are believed to have at least 40,000 well-armed
men in the field, compared with Sihanouk's 15,000. When Vietnam's
120,000 regular soldiers leave Cambodia as promised, by 1990, the
Khmer Rouge surely will try to make a comeback.
   To prevent this, the United States gives Sihanouk open and covert
aid of $20 million a year, though reluctantly because it is afraid
of upsetting China. Southeast Asian countries, including Malaya and
Singapore, also help Sihanouk.
   The Khmer Rouge are the only crucial pawn China still holds in
the struggle for Cambodia. To abandon them, the Chinese leadership
expects concessions from Moscow.

   A former TWA hostage said Friday
he received a mysterious telephone call from Beirut about a month
before testifying at the trial of confessed hijacker Mohammed Ali
Hamadi.
   Ralf Traugott, who was aboard the plane hijacked in 1985, also
described how the Shiite Moslem calmly said, ``This is the man we
killed,'' after he read an article about the American Navy diver
slain aboard the TWA jetliner.
   Traugott, 36, a German-born American citizen, said he received a
telephone call about four weeks ago in which a man identified
himself as ``Mr. Hamadi'' and said he was calling from Beirut.
   ``I thought it was kind of strange,'' Traugott said. ``The man on
the other end of the line said `Hello Mr. Ralf.'''
   ``I said, `Who's this?' and he said, `Mr. Hamadi. This is Beirut,
Lebanon calling,''' Traugott said. The man then hung up, he said.
   Hamadi comes from a family of 11 children. One of his brothers,
Abdul-Hadi, is the security chief for Hezbollah, or Party of God, a
radical Shiite Moslem group backed by Iran and believed to be
holding the foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   Hamadi has denied being a member of Hezbollah, but has admitted
to taking part in the hijacking of TWA Flight 847, which was seized
on an Athens-to-Rome flight and diverted to Beirut and Algiers.
Thirty-nine Americans were held hostage for 17 days and U.S. Navy
diver Robert Stethem, 23, of Waldorf, Md., was shot and thrown out
of the plane to die on the tarmac at Beirut airport.
   Hamadi is charged with murder and air piracy.
   Traugott showed the court a Lebanese newspaper, An-Nahar, dated
June 16, 1985.
   The newspaper included photographs of the hijacked plane and of
Stethem's body on the tarmac. Traugott said Hamadi had been reading
the newspaper aboard the plane.
   ``I asked him what was in it,'' Traugott said. ``He said, `This
is the man we killed.' I asked him, `Did you shoot him?'''
   ``He said, `No, my friend shot him,''' Traugott said. ``He said
it very nonchalantly, like it was no big deal.''
   Court documents have identified Hamadi's accomplice as Hassan
Ezzeddine, who is at large.
   When he asked Hamadi why the hijackers shot Stethem, Traugott
said Hamadi replied: ``This man was a Marine.''
   Other witnesses have also testified the hijackers apparently
mistook Stethem for a U.S. Marine.
   Traugott said he did not witness the shooting. ``I don't think
anyone saw the shooting,'' he said.
   The slain diver's parents, Richard and Patricia Stethem, watched
attentively as Traugott described the scene. They have followed the
trial regularly since it started in July.
   Traugott told the court that Hamadi held a gun and a grenade
against his head and told him he was a member of Hezbollah and
trained in Iran.
   When Traugott told him he was not afraid, Hamadi ``twisted the
pistol against my forehead and I said, `OK, I am afraid,''' the
witness said.
   Chief Judge Heiner Mueckenberger opened Friday's session by
announcing Hamadi's parents arrived from their home in Beirut and
were expected to testify Tuesday.
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport in January 1987 when
customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage.

   Mayor Pietro Giubilo has been forced to shelve his
plan to reduce Rome's heavy traffic because of city council
opposition to the alternate license plate scheme, newspapers
reported Friday.
   ``Twelve Years of Only Promises,'' lamented the Rome daily La
Repubblica, referring to a long series of unrealized plans to ease
what the mayor called the city's ``traffic emergency.''
   Giubilo had proposed cars be allowed to enter the center on
alternate days, depending on even or odd license plates.
   Opponents of the plan charged it would hurt business, could not
be enforced and would favor those owning more than one car.

   A free-for-all with white supremacists that left
talk show host Geraldo Rivera with a broken nose will be civil
rights leader Roy Innis' last television brawl, Innis said Friday.
   ``Let me say that I, in relation to my wife, I have retired from
fighting on television,'' Innis said on the WWOR-TV program,
``People Are Talking.''
   The latest episode _ the second time a television interview
involving Innis turned violent _ occurred Thursday during the taping
of Rivera's talk show.
   Racist remarks prompted Innis, chairman of the Congress of Racial
Equality, to grab a young white supremacist by the neck; other
supremacists stormed the stage, and chairs and punches were thrown.
   Earlier this year, Innis had a run-in with New York activist the
Rev. Al Sharpton, shoving him to the floor on the Morton Downey Show.
   ``I don't want to use the term culprit, but you have the same
person making the first move'' on both programs, said Bill Boggs,
executive producer of the Downey show.
   ``I surely didn't need a confrontation after the Sharpton
situation,'' Innis conceded. ``I've had two incidents because of a
new phenomenon that is hitting America in the last couple of years:
increased public indecency.''
   ``There are certain racist types, blacks and whites, who feel
they have a constitutional right to verbally abuse and physically
abuse people,'' Innis said. ``I think it is immoral for decent
people to acquiesce to that.''
   Rivera's show featured members of the White Aryan Resistance
Youth, The American Front and Skinheads of the National Resistance,
the latter named for their close-cropped hair.
   Other guests included Innis, Rabbi A. Bruce Goldman and a
Bayonne, N.J., couple who said they were attacked and terrorized by
skinheads.
   The brawl started when John Metzger, 20, leader of the White
Aryan Resistance Youth, complained about ``kikes'' and called Innis
an ``Uncle Tom.''
   Innis got up from his seat and began choking Metzger. Innis said
he ``gently massaged his neck.''
   The result, Rivera said, was ``like a bench-clearing brawl at a
hockey match. About a dozen of them came out of the audience.''
   Rivera was first struck on the back of the head with a chair,
said his spokesman, Jeff Erdel. His nose was broken either when he
fell or when he was struck by a second chair while lying on the
floor.
   Afterward, Rivera called for calm, concluded the show with a
smaller panel and then taped two more shows. He was examined by a
doctor and may undergo surgery, Erdel said.
   The skinheads had been isolated from the audience by burly, armed
guards, Erdel said.
   ``No one wanted violence on the program and we took every
precaution imaginable to ensure that,'' Erdel said. ``But once the
violence happened, Geraldo fought back _ and he fought well. He got
in some terrific punches.''
   Innis said that, violence notwithstanding, programs featuring
controversial guests should be allowed to continue.
   ``To have these kinds of people spew their hate out in the gutter
and in the basement is more dangerous. I think that's how the brown
shirts in Germany got started,'' Innis said. ``You (need to) expose
those guys quickly: the Sharptons, the Maddoxes, the Masons, the
skinheads, the klan.''
   The program will be broadcast late this month on 178 television
stations around the nation. The exact date has not been chosen.
   ``No question, it's big ratings. People are going to want to see
the show when it airs,'' Boggs said. ``But I can assure you Geraldo
and his producers did not set out for Geraldo to get his nose
broken.''

   A seven-man team of British bobbies Friday
climbed 1,575 steps to defeat their American counterparts in a
stair-climbing race at the Empire State Building, but neither team
ever left the 86th floor.
   ``They promised the people in England that they would climb the
stairs of the Empire State Building if they contributed (to a
hospital fund-raising drive), and they did,'' said Robert Udowitz, a
spokesman for the event.
   Members of Britain's West Bar Police Station in Sheffield
competed against officers from Brooklyn's 67th Precinct in a race
that fulfilled a fund-raising obligation.
   Well, sort of.
   Instead of actually climbing the steps to the top of the
102-story landmark, the officers raced on a ``Stairmaster''
computerized stair-climbing machine that simulated the same number
of steps.
   The machine was on the 86th floor deck of the Empire State
Building, so Udowitz figures that was nearly the top of the building.
   The bobbies won the race in just under 30 minutes, completing all
131 flights of stairs while the Brooklynites finished 128.
   During the contest, team members passed a baton shaped like the
Empire State Building to their successor after approximately 225
steps.
   The Sheffield force has raised more than $10,000 in England for
the Rotherham District Hospital. The drive was started by an officer
whose daughter was born with cerebral palsy and is being treated in
Rotherham Hospital.

<HEAD>Reagan Pocket Veto of Wilderness Bill Could Work Against GOP, Dems
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE DENNISON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HELENA, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan's decision to pocket veto a
wilderness bill that would have released 4.1 million acres of land
for development could backfire against state GOP candidates, say
hopeful Democrats.
   But Republicans, who sought the veto claiming the bill did not
free up enough land, are looking to harvest votes from Reagan's
action _ only the second such veto in his eight years in office.
   Reagan announced Wednesday he would not sign a bill designating
1.43 million acres of roadless national forest land in Montana as
federally protected wilderness. It was only the second time he has
vetoed a state wilderness bill. He has signed more than 30.
   More than 6 million acres of Montana wilderness have been closed
to development because of federal court decisions in the late 1970s
and early 1980s. A wilderness bill from Congress is needed to
release any of this land for other use; the bill vetoed by Reagan,
by protecting 1.43 million acres, would have freed up the remaining
land.
   The White House denied the veto decision was political. But first
word of the veto came not from the White House but from Conrad
Burns, the GOP challenger to Sen. John Melcher, D-Mont., who
sponsored the wilderness legislation.
   Polls show Burns in a close race with Melcher, and Burns
campaigned heavily in recent days on what he said would have been
the legislation's negative impact on Montana jobs.
   ``As our next senator, I will hold hearings across Montana on
this critical issue and work to pass wilderness legislation that is
in the best interest of all Montanans,'' he said in a statement
released with the veto announcement.
   Burns and the Republican candidates for the state's two
congressional seats all asked Reagan to veto the measure, saying it
would cost jobs by locking up too much land as wilderness and
wilderness study areas, putting miners and loggers out of work.
   Reagan offered the same explanation in his veto message and also
noted the bill designated almost twice the amount of wilderness
recommended by the U.S. Forest Service.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Thursday the veto
resulted from ``a variety of economic and environmental reasons,''
not politics.
   But Democrats and environmentalists said the move was political
manipulation, pointing out that nearly all wilderness bills signed
by Reagan have had more wilderness acreage than recommended by the
Forest Service.
   ``This whole veto is simply part of an effort to reduce the
possibility that there might be more Democrats in the U.S. Senate
next session,'' said Sherm Janke of Bozeman, chairman of the Montana
chapter of the Sierra Club. ``The real reason is to embarrass the
candidacies of those who have supported the wilderness legislation.''
   Some Democrats predicted a backlash, noting the issue of
wilderness preservation in Montana has been debated for a decade,
with this year's bill the first potential resolution.
   ``We're looking at a process that's been going on for 13 years,
and with a lack of a stroke of a pen, Ronald Reagan has just dumped
all that in a dumpster,'' said Ron Richards, a Melcher aide. ``I
would think there's going to be some resentment among some folks.''
   Democrats say releasing the 4.1 million acres is needed to
stabilize Montana's mining and timber industries, which are
recovering from recession in the early 1980s.
   Tom Daubert, press secretary for the Dukakis-Bentsen campaign in
Montana, expressed hope that the veto might convince more Montanans
to vote against Vice President and GOP presidential nominee George
Bush, who Democrats say advised Reagan on the veto.
   ``George Bush has added insult to injury here,'' Daubert said.
``We've had eight years of voodoo economics, and the icing on the
cake is prolonged instability in the mining and timber industries. I
think Montanans know that jobs are at stake here.''

<HEAD>High Lead Levels Found in Alaska Town; Blood Tests Planned</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tests on dust and soil in the southeast
Alaska town of Skagway show lead levels 560 times above normal, and
officials are offering free blood tests for all residents.
   Officials stressed Thursday there was no cause for alarm and no
evidence that any of the town's 790 residents were poisoned.
   The lead is believed to be linked to an ore terminal at Skagway
harbor operated by Bowhead Equipment Co. of Seattle and owned by
White Pass Transportation Ltd.
   Bowhead stores and loads ore concentrates, mostly lead and zinc
sulfide, that are mined in the Yukon by Curragh Resources Inc. of
Canada. The powdery ore is shipped from Skagway to Japan, Korea,
Europe and Australia.
   The normal level of lead in Skagway's soil is about 50 parts per
million, said Dick Stokes, southeast regional supervisor for the
state Department of Environmental Conservation. The tests showed
lead levels as high as 28,000 parts per million, said Jim Cronin, a
consulting engineer with a company hired by Bowhead.
   However, officials said they did not know what level of lead in
soil poses a threat.
   ``It's very dependent upon the form of the material, the location
of the material and the potential pathways to human exposure,'' said
Carl Lautenberger of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
   Until 1982 the ore was transported to the terminal by rail. Since
1986, when the terminal reopened, the ore has been taken through
town on trucks.
   Terminal employees have undergone tests for several years to
comply with federal safety rules.
   Children, pregnant women and families of workers at an ore
terminal at Skagway Harbor are most at risk of lead poisoning, said
Dr. Katherine Kelly of the state Health and Social Services
Department.
   Lead poisoning can cause headaches, anemia, colic, paralysis and
cramps. It also can stunt growth in children and cause birth defects.
   Cronin said soil tests also revealed high levels of zinc, which
is less of a health concern, and lower levels of mercury, cadmium,
copper and silver.

<TEXT>
   The ex-wife of a man sentenced to two years in
prison for threatening the life of Jesse Jackson received a 20-month
sentence Friday in connection with the case.
   Tammy Williams, 27, of Washington, Mo., had pleaded guilty to a
charge of possessing an unregistered automatic weapon in exchange
for the government dropping charges of intimidating and threatening
a witness.
   U.S. District Judge Edward Filippine placed Mrs. Williams on
three years' supervised release following her prison term and
ordered to pay $50. He also ordered her to enter a substance abuse
program during that period.
   Filippine said Mrs. Williams, jailed since May, would be credited
with the time she has already served.
   In seeking leniency, defense lawyer Cynthia Short told the court
that Mrs. Williams had divorced Londell Williams, effective Oct. 31.
   ``I think that signifies her willingness and desire to start
again,'' Short said. The lawyer asked that her client be sentenced
at the low end of the scale so that she could ``put the last six
months behind her.''
   ``I ask that you return me to my children as soon as possible so
I can raise them, because they are without parents right now,'' Mrs.
Williams told Filippine.
   Mrs. Williams faced a maximum penalty of 24 months in prison and
$30,000 in fines.
   Her former husband was sentenced Monday to 24 months in prison
and ordered to pay $100 on charges of threatening Jackson's life and
possessing the automatic rifle, which authorities found buried in a
wooded area near Washington. Williams, 30, had pleaded guilty to
those charges in August.
   Williams, who has said that he grew up with ``prejudices against
anything that isn't white,'' allegedly told a government informant
that he planned to kill Jackson, who was then seeking the Democratic
presidential nomination.
   In a taped conversation with the informant, Williams said the
black civil rights leader should be killed because he was ``trying
to make a fool out of us white people.''
   The Williamses were arrested May 13 at their apartment in
Washington, about 50 miles west of St. Louis.

<HEAD>Ohio Congressman Wants Fernald Site on Superfund List</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An Ohio congressman on Friday asked the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency to add the Fernald uranium
processing plant to the nation's Superfund cleanup program of toxic
waste sites.
   Democratic Rep. Thomas Luken, a persistent critic of the Fernald
plant, said putting it on the cleanup list may be the only way to
pressure its owner, the U.S. Department of Energy, into cleaning up
radioactive contamination at the plant's 1,050-acre site in Fernald,
18 miles northwest of Cincinnati.
   The plant, formally known as the Feed Materials Production
Center, processes uranium for the government's production of nuclear
weapons, which are produced elsewhere.
   Nearly 13 million pounds of uranium-containing waste have been
dumped into the environment since the plant opened in 1951,
according to the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. The DOE has
admitted the dumping and says it plans to clean up the area.
   ``To make Fernald a Superfund site may be the only way we can get
the ball rolling on cleaning up the Fernald site,'' Luken said.
   The request will be directed to EPA Administrator Lee Thomas.
   In Washington, Energy Department spokeswoman Gail Bradshaw said
her department was unaware of Luken's request. She said other Energy
Department sites have already been added to the Superfund list.
   ``I don't think we'd have any comment other than it is our intent
to bring them all into compliance,'' Ms. Bradshaw said of Luken's
proposal.
   Residents near the Fernald plant and the state of Ohio have
separate lawsuits pending, alleging that the plant has polluted its
environment with radioactive materials and created a public health
threat.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's huge reception
from the Polish people and her outspoken calls to recognize
Solidarity and pull down the Berlin Wall won praise and front-page
headlines in Britain.
   Mrs. Thatcher's boldness, and in particular her statement that
economic cooperation with the West would come only when basic human
rights were a way of life in Poland, surprised even her supporters
in the media.
   The pro-Thatcher Times of London called her statement in Warsaw
on Thursday ``remarkarble,'' saying it showed ``greater boldness
than expected.'' The Daily Telegraph called it ``forthright'' and
The Independent said it was ``a remarkably hard-line speech to the
Polish government.''
   The tabloid Daily Express, which supports Mrs. Thatcher's
Conservative government, had a front-page headline saying:
``Thatcher Freedom Speech Is Censored.''
   It said by the time her speech was beamed to the Polish people on
television, ``out had gone all the references to the Berlin Wall,
the Helsinki agreement, human rights, Solidarity and Warsaw Pact
chemical weapons.''
   The Daily Mirror, which supports the socialist opposition Labor
Party, had a brief story on page 2, focusing on Mrs. Thatcher
shopping in a Warsaw market. It then reported here comments on
Western aid.
   The Times said: ``Mrs. Thatcher's words were clearly aimed at a
much wider audience. It was an important address on East-West
relations significantly timed at the moment when the U.S.
presidential election leaves her as the dominant voice in the West.''
   Under the headline ``Thatcher Preaches Polish Pluralism,'' the
liberal Guardian said: ``Mrs. Thatcher has decided to deliver a
magisterial lesson to both sides in deeply divided Poland, warning
the government that it must give its people freedom, but preparing
to tell Lech Walesa that strikes offer no solution.''
   The tabloids focused more on her reception. The conservative
Daily Mail said in its front-page headline: ``Thousands Cheer Maggie
on her Polish Pilgrimage.'' The independent daily Today, under the
headline, ``Poles Sob as Maggie Calls for Freedom,'' said:
``Cheering crowds mobbed Premier Maggie Thatcher yesterday as she
made a triumphant visit to Warsaw.''
   The British Broadcasting Corp. quoted Neil Kinnock, leader of the
Labor Party, as saying Friday that Mrs. Thatcher's exhortation for
the Polish government to talk with Solidarity was insincere because
Mrs. Thatcher herself did not talk to any sections of society.
   The Guardian said in an editorial Friday that the Department of
Trade and Industry had suddenly postponed an expected announcement
about the future of a British shipyard under threat of closure.
   A department spokesman, unidentified in keeping with British
practice, said only that discussions were under way with the
shipbuilders.
   The paper said the alleged delay was likely ``a political move to
avoid embarrassment for Mrs. Thatcher'' when she went to Gdansk,
where the government has announced it is closing the Lenin shipyard.

<TEXT>
   An Air Force logistics center in Georgia paid
an estimated $104 million for spare parts that did not meet contract
specifications, amounting to 89 percent of its inventory, according
to a Pentagon audit.
   A draft copy of a Pentagon Inspector General's report concluded
``the Air Force did not receive the quality parts it paid for.''
   A spokesman for Air Force Logistics Command at Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, took sharp issue with the draft
report, which was obtained from the Pentagon and distributed by the
Project on Military Procurement, a private watchdog group in
Washington.
   ``The figure is very misleading,'' said Air Force spokesman Ken
Perrotte. ``They tested a sample and made projections,'' he said,
challenging both the methods and the calculations used by the
Inspector General's office.
   He was unable to offer an alternative estimate of the percentage
or value of the spares that did not conform to contract
specifications. He said that detailed calculations were likely to be
included in a report that was being prepared at Air Force
headquarters at the Pentagon in response to the draft Inspector
General's report.
   To make their estimate, auditors from the inspector general's
office visited the Warner Robbins Air Logistics Center, 18 miles
south of Macon, Ga., and checked samples of 46 inventory items,
ranging from a bolt costing $6.95 to more complicated hardware
costing thousands of dollars per item.
   The center is one of five maintained by the Air Force around the
country. Together, the five employ 20,000 people and warehouse spare
parts and components worth $2.09 billion, the report said.
   The total value of the items checked was $114.4 million, of which
$48.4 million worth were found to have major ``nonconformances''
which made them unfit for service and $55 million had less problems,
known as minor nonconformances.
   The auditors checked 1,027 samples of 46 different items, and
projected their results against a total of 685,925 spare parts
calculated to have been at the center. Those projections showed that
89 percent of the spares did not meet contract specifications.
   ``We projected that the Logistics Center paid about $103.8
million for spare parts that had major nonconformances and minor
nonconformances to contract specifications,'' the Inspector
General's report said.
   ``Since the same acquisition and quality assurance procedures
used to purchase spare parts at the Logistics Center are also used
other Air Force Logistics Centers, the same probability exists that
the other centers have acquired nonconforming spare parts in supply
classes that we audited,'' it said.
   Perrotte, the Air Force spokesman, also challenged that finding,
saying that the inspectors classified as nonconforming many items
which had only slight defects ``and were fully serviceable.''
   The Inspector General's report was the first to deal specifically
with Air Force spare parts.
   However, the report listed seven previous audits, dating back to
1983, which indicated widespread quality control problems in the
military. Those audits found that:
   _A contractor shipped $3 million in defective spare parts to an
Army depot in Corpus Christi, Texas, in 1983.
   _Defective parts on Navy helicopters were ``not always reported
or investigated,'' in 1984.
   _More than 50 percent of the quality deficiency reports sent to
the Defense Logistics Agency were inaccurate or inadequate, in 1986.
   _Defense Department field offices did not always ensure that
supplies and services conformed to contract specifications, in 1986.
   _The number of known defective items going unreported was small,
in 1987.
   _The Air Force was experiencing problems with the quality of
fiber optic cables, but failed to follow through, in 1988.
   _Four classes of Navy missiles failed to conform to contract
specifications, in 1988.
   The latest audit showed that ``Contractors that supplied the
parts failed to satisfactorily control quality, the Department of
Defense did not identify the quality control problems, and
nonconforming parts were accepted by the government and not
identified for corrective management actions,'' the Inspector
General's report said.

<TEXT>
   The captain of a Philippine ship that
sank in Typhoon Ruby with 500 people aboard did not heed repeated
weather warnings, an official told a hearing on the Oct. 24 disaster.
   Juanito Lirios, deputy director of the Philippine Atmospheric,
Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration, gave the
testimony at the opening of a government hearing on the sinking of
the Dona Marilyn.
   The Maritime Industry Authority, which conducted the hearing,
said it would order owners Sulpicio Lines to show cause why it
should not lose its franchise because of the disaster, the second
within 10 months involving a Sulpicio passenger ship.
   Officials say 161 passengers and 39 crewmen have been rescued so
far from the Dona Marilyn. At least 76 people are confirmed dead.
   On Wednesday, President Corazon Aquino said she was suspending
Sulpicio's passenger service indefinitely.
   But Sulpicio Vice President Vicente Gambito said Friday he had
received no such order and service was continuing. Philip Tuazon,
chief of maritime authority, said the suspension meant all Sulpicio
vessels would be held in port until they and their crews passed
inspection.
   Lirios said the weather center issued 21 advisories on the
approach of Typhoon Ruby starting Oct. 23, the day before the Dona
Marilyn sailed from Manila to Tacloban on Leyte island.
   The first bulletin warned the typhoon was threatening the eastern
Visayas islands, where the vessel sank, he said.
   The advisories go to the center's 64 coastal radio stations,
which relay them to ships at sea.
   ``It is the duty of the captain to monitor the weather,'' Lirios
said.
   Coast guard officials said they cleared the Dona Marilyn for
sailing because weather in Manila was good.
   On Thursday, shipowners appealed to Mrs. Aquino to reconsider
suspending Sulpicio, the country's largest domestic shipping
company. It operates 22 passenger and cargo ships which carry 20
percent of domestic traffic among the country's 7,200 islands.
   ``We would like to caution the government against taking hasty
decisions,'' said Pacencio Balbon, president of the Conference of
Interisland Shipowners and Operators.
   Figures on the Dona Marilyn's casualty toll vary widely because
of conflicting reports on the number aboard. The skipper, Capt.
Eliodoro Salgado, is among the missing.

<TEXT>
   Swiss authorities said Friday that
billions of dollars may have been laundered through Switzerland for
a Middle Eastern drug ring, and they said nine people were arrested.
   A statement from the Ticino state prosecutor's office said those
arrested included six Lebanese, one Syrian, one Swiss of Turkish
origin and one Turk.
   It said two Lebanese were in investigative custody, accused of
falsifying documents, complicity in fraud and violating Swiss
narcotics laws. The others were released on bail. The suspects were
not identified.
   The communique also said authorities seized 220 pounds of heroin
in Bellinzona, capital of Ticino state, in connection with the
money-laundering investigation. It said the drugs were seized Feb.
24, 1987.
   Ticino state prosecutor Dick Marty said authorities have evidence
that ``billions of Swiss francs'' in drug money may have been
laundered by the ring.
   The prosecutor said the money was carried to Switzerland by
couriers from the Middle East and the United States. It said the
investigation was ``unusually complex.''
   The comments came in response to a Swiss newspaper report that a
Lebanese-Turkish ring had $1 billion laundered through Swiss banks
and foreign-controlled companies in Switzerland.
   The Zurich newspaper Tages-Anzeiger said four Lebanese nationals
brought ``suitcases full of cash'' into Switzerland before they were
arrested in July.
   Zurich District Attorney Peter Gasser confirmed that four men
were arrested in Zurich in July. He also said that accounts held
with several big Swiss banks had been ordered frozen and that
``funds of suspicious origin'' were seized. He did not elaborate.
   Money laundering is not yet a criminal offense in Switzerland
unless the funds are used for criminal purposes.

   Students firebombed government
buildings and a U.S. military facility Friday, demanding that
officials arrest former President Chun Doo-hwan and withdraw U.S.
troops.
   In an effort to defuse growing political instability, the ruling
party chairman met with Chun and asked him to respond to allegations
of corruption.
   Yoon Giel-joong, chairman of the Democratic Justice Party, said
after the three-hour meeting that Chun may make an open apology for
misrule and act to allay public sentiment against him.
   U.S. authorities said a dozen young people threw six firebombs
into the compound of a U.S. Army engineering installation in Seoul
and fled before police arrived. Windows were broken but no one was
hurt, they said.
   In Seoul and elsewhere, radical students staged anti-Chun
demonstrations and lobbed firebombs at a government party building
and branch office of a U.S.-South Korea joint venture bank. No
injuries or arrests were reported.
   Five students demanding Chun's arrest seized a third-floor office
in the Office of National Taxation in Seoul. It took police half an
hour to overpower them.
   Police said two students were injured slightly when they jumped
onto mattresses placed on the ground outside the government building
to prevent suicides by the protesters.
   In southern Kwangju city, 300 students hurling firebombs clashed
with riot police for more than two hours.
   As part of their anti-government campaign, radical students are
pressing for Chun's arrest for alleged corruption and human rights
violations during his presidency, which ended in February.
   The students' demand for the withdrawal of 42,000 U.S. troops
stationed in South Korea is part of their campaign against the
United States. Several U.S. government buildings have been their
targets recently.
   On Thursday, more than 29,000 people took part in rallies or
street protests against Chun, newspapers said.
   Officials said about 380 people, mostly police, were injured and
about 100 protesters detained Thursday, a day of the worst
anti-government protests in recent months.
   Police fired 9,200 rounds of tear gas against 18,700 firebombs.
Students attacked six government party offices, eight police
substations and two government buildings, police said.
   Police maintained tight security around Chun's house, where
students threatened to march Saturday.
   Chun, who took power with military backing in 1980, has been
under parliamentary investigation on various charges, including his
alleged role in putting down a 1980 civil uprising in Kwangju. By
official count, about 200 people died in the military crackdown, but
dissidents put the number much higher.
   Radicals also are demanding the overthrow of President Roh
Tae-woo and claim his government is a front for military rule
despite the democratic reforms he has instituted.
   The radical students have little public support, but are
influential on college campuses.

   More than 500 Nicaraguans fleeing the
hurricane-devastated Atlantic coast have sought refuge in Costa Rica
in recent days, the government said Friday.
   ``Immigration officials are expecting a landslide of new
Nicaraguan refugees in the next weeks and that concerns us because
all the refugee camps in Costa Rica are already filled with
Nicaraguans,'' said Luis Alberto Cordero, an aide to President Oscar
Arias.
   Hurricane Joan destroyed the port of Bluefields as it blasted
into Nicaragua on Oct. 24, killing more than 100 people, leaving
another 200,000 homeless and striking another blow at Nicaragua's
already devastated economy.
   Cordero said the new arrivals are mainly from the Bluefields
area, which is about 200 miles north of the Costa Rican port of
Puerto Limon. He did not say whether they came by land or by sea.
   More than 10,000 Nicaraguans live in Costa Rican refugee camps
run by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. But there are
actually more than 200,000 Nicaraguans in Costa Rica, according to
Carlos Jose Arce, chief of the Costa Rican immigration office.
   ``We are facing one of the strongest floods of inmigrants and we
are not prepared to receive them, because we have our own
problems,'' Cordero said.
   Hurricane Joan's torrential rains also hit Costa Rica, destroying
at least 1,500 towns and villages and flooding many more.

<HEAD>German Tourist Gets Death Penalty In Insurance Slaying Of
Girlfriend</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A West German was sentenced Friday to die in
Florida's electric chair for the murder of his girlfriend in Miami
Beach more than a year ago.
   After hearing his sentence, 44-year-old Dieter Riechmann told
Dade Circuit Judge Harold Solomon: ``I was found guilty but there
was not one shred of evidence that proved my guilt. I don't accept
any kind of penalty _ the death penalty or imprisonment. ... I am
sure the verdict will not stand up under appeal.''
   Riechmann was found guilty of first-degree murder on Aug. 12 in
the shooting of Kirsten Kischnick, 31, on Oct. 25, 1987.
   Prosecutors said the murder was committed to collect more than $1
million in insurance.
   Riechmann had claimed that a pedestrian shot Ms. Kischnick in the
head with a .38-caliber pistol after the two stopped their car to
ask directions in downtown Miami.
   He said he then drove frantically around Miami and finally to
Miami Beach looking for a policeman. But police and prosecutors
doubted the story.
   The state noted that a .38-caliber weapon similar to the one used
in the killing was found in Riechmann's luggage.
   On Aug. 30, by a 9-3 vote, the jury recommended the death penalty.
   In a plea for his client's life, attorney Edward Carhart said
that in the penalty phase of the trial, evidence was presented that
the motive for the crime was insurance, but there was no proof that
there was ``cold calculation and premeditation'' and that there was
``a question that he did it for the insurance.''
   Carhart also said he was ``troubled by the fact that the jury
didn't realize the serious possibility that a mistake has been
made.''
   He then asked the judge to overrule the jury's recommendation and
sentence Riechmann to life imprisonment with no possibility of
parole.
   In sentencing Riechmann to death, Solomon said he had carefully
considered the testimony.
   ``I find that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the
mitigating circumstances,'' he said, ``and that the crime was
committed in a cold, calculating and premeditated manner.''

   A 10-year-old boy who allegedly shot a bus
driver in the head for trying to take him back to school probably
won't face criminal charges, an attorney said Friday.
   Instead, if the boy is judged to be delinquent at a civil trial
he could become a ward of the Texas Youth Commission, which oversees
punishment of juveniles, until he is 21, said Roger Fry, an
assistant district attorney
   The boy will remain in the Jefferson County Detention Center for
at least 10 days, State District Judge Gary Sanderson ruled.
   Meanwhile, Russell Jean Hampton, 40, remained in critical
condition in a Port Arthur hospital with a gunshot wound to the head.
   The shooting occurred Thursday after Ms. Hampton had dropped
students off at school and noticed the boy on her way back to park
the bus.
   Ms. Hampton apparently told the boy to get on the bus, with the
intention of returning him to school or reporting him for truancy,
authorities said.
   A .22-caliber handgun was recovered from the bus, police said.

<HEAD>Dukakis Says He Would Talk to Terrorists</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential candidate Michael
Dukakis said Friday there's nothing wrong with talking to terrorists
holding U.S. hostages as long as no concessions are made.
   The Reagan administration has said it will not negotiate directly
with groups holding Americans hostage in Lebanon, although public
investigation of the Iran-Contra affair showed that secret deals
were made with Iranian officials who apparently had influence with
the kidnappers.
   ``I've never said that you don't negotiate,'' Dukakis said in an
interview on NBC's ``Today.'' ``You talk, you make every effort to
get those hostages back home, but you never make concessions to the
hostage takers.''
   ``Mike Dukakis is going to work as hard as he possibly can,'' he
said. ``First to have an anti-terrorism policy that's real and,
secondly, to do everything he can to get those hostages and reunite
those families, but never, never do the kind of thing that we did
when we traded arms to the ayatollah.''
   He said the decision to trade arms to Iran during the Reagan-Bush
administration was ``one of the worst things that ever happened.''
   ``You can't make concessions to terrorists if you're serious
about fighting terrorism and stopping this hostage taking,'' Dukakis
said.
   Bush, in his presidential campaign, has spoken of a need to
strike back at terrorists. He said in the first presidential debate
that the administration has made ``vast improvements in our
anti-terrorism'' since the arms-for-hostages dealing.
   On efforts for peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors,
Dukakis said he might travel to the Middle East as president ``if I
thought it would make a difference,'' but he expressed a preference
for leaving such talks to his secretary of state.
   ``There has been no progress for eight years, since the Camp
David Accords,'' he said. ``We're going to make it a priority.''

   Many former Nazis are still living who
never were ``brought to account'' for ransacking Jewish synagogues
and businesses in a 1938 pogrom known as ``Crystal Night,'' an
expert on war crimes said.
   ``You will find hardly anyone who has been prosecuted who
participated in Crystal Night,'' Robert M.W. Kempner was quoted as
saying in a newsletter published Friday by the opposition Social
Democratic Party.
   ``Many people who were involved are living among us and receiving
social assistance,'' said the 89-year-old Kempner, a deputy
prosecutor at the 1945-46 postwar trial of Nazi war criminals in
Nuremberg.
   On the night of Nov. 9-10, 1938, Nazi sympathizers destroyed more
than 250 synagogues and 7,500 businesses across Germany. Dozens of
Jews died in the pogrom, known as ``Crystal Night'' for the
shattered glass left on the streets. ``Many of those responsible for
the pogrom were not brought to account,'' Kempner was quoted as
saying.
   He did not say whether he knew of any individuals who were
involved in the pogrom and are still alive.
   Kempner, a lawyer who worked in the German Interior Ministry and
lost his job after Nazi leader Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933,
left Germany in 1935 and moved to the United States. He returned
after World War II, participated in the Nuremberg trials as a
prosecutor and now has a residence in Frankfurt.
   Also on Friday, the Social Democratic Party announced that two
leading West German politicians plan to visit East Germany and
Poland to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Crystal Night.
   Gerhard Jahn, a Social Democrat and member of Parliament, is to
participate in the Nov. 9 anniversary observance of Crystal Night to
be held in the East German Parliament. Jahn was invited by the East
German government, the Social Democrats said.
   The main Crystal Night anniversary in West Germany will take
place in Frankfurt on the same day and will be attended by President
Richard von Weizsaecker and Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Another leading Social Democrat, Annemarie Renger, is to lay a
wreath on Monday at the site of the Nazi concentration camp in
Auschwitz.
   An estimated 6 million Jews were killed in the Nazi Holocaust.

   Four high-ranking officials resigned
Friday from their posts in a province where Serbian nationalists are
demanding a purge of the Communist leadership, an official report
said.
   The resignations brought to five the number of members of
Kosovo's ruling Presidium that have stepped down after a meeting
Wednesday. At that session, Communist leaders of the republic of
Serbia, which includes Kosovo, argued over Serbian demands.
   Serbian Communist party leader Slobodan Milosevic blames Kosovo's
leadership for tension between the province's ethnic Albanian
majority and its Slav minority. Milosevic is trying to amend
Yugoslavia's constitution to give Serbia more control over Kosovo,
which is nominally autonomous.
   Mass rallies over the past few months, combined with labor
strikes over economic demands, have brought down the leadership in
Serbia's other province, Vojvodina.
   The news agency Tanjug said Milan Gvozdic, a Slav, stepped down
from Kosovo's 13-man Presidium. Two ethnic Albanians, Ekrem Arifi
and Rahman Dedai, and another Slav, Vojislav Zajic, later announced
their resignations, Tanjug said.
   Presidium member Uros Seslija, also a Slav, resigned Thursday
night.
   Tanjug did not say why they resigned, but indicated further
resignations could be expected. It was unclear if it was refering to
Azem Vlasi, Kosovo's most prominent ethnic Albanian leader and the
main target of Serbian complaints.

   A major Jewish organization, B'nai B'rith, on
Friday presented a menorah to Secretary of State George P. Shultz in
recognition of his support for human rights and opposition to
terrorism.
   Shultz accepted the award from Seymour Reich, the president of
B'nai B'rith, at a State Department ceremony.
   Reich said the menorah, an ancient Jewish symbol of freedom,
``symbolizes for us all that you have done as secretary of state in
behalf of human rights everywhere, in behalf of seeking peace, not
only in the Middle East but throughout the world, of facing the
Soviets and determining it was appropriate to engage in an INF
(Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces) treaty.''
   Also, the B'nai B'rith president said, ``We are very proud of
your stand on terrorism, something that you have condemned publicly
and courageously and emotionally.''
   Shultz said he would add the menorah to the one in his home that
he lights at Christmas, Easter and on other holidays.
   ``I have lived with a menorah practically all my life,'' Shultz
said.
   He explained that his mother kept in her dining room a menorah
she had inherited from an uncle, an Episcopalian priest who
displayed the Jewish symbol as an expression of his ecumenical
convictions.
   B'nai B'rith is a service organization that maintains ties with
Jews in 41 countries and supports civil liberties for minority
groups.

   A coroner's inquest ruled Friday that Maj. Hugh
Lindsay died accidentally in an avalanche in the Swiss Alps that
nearly engulfed Prince Charles and others in their ski group in
March.
   The inquest said that although the group probably caused the
avalanche as it skied off the main trail, no individual was at fault.
   Lindsay, a 34-year-old career army officer and former aide to
Queen Elizabeth II, was skiing with the party at the Swiss resort of
Klosters on March 10 when the avalanche happened.
   Charles, the 39-year-old heir to the British throne, and several
others skiied clear and escaped injury.
   But Lindsay and another skier, Patti Palmer-Tomkinson, were swept
away. She suffered broken legs and lung injuries.
   Coroner John Burton recorded the verdict after a 40-minute
inquest in which he read an official Swiss report. It said Lindsay
was probably killed by a block of ice that hit him on the head.

<TEXT>
   A mysterious substance that erodes clothing
and furniture has forced a family to flee their home and has baffled
hazardous-materials investigators, officials said Friday.
   ``Yesterday, the furniture started falling apart, and their
clothing started falling off their body,'' said Ray Hughes, chief of
the Dayton Fire Department's suppression bureau. ``The clothing _
you could run your fingers through it.''
   ``We're worrying about long-term health effects,'' said Lt.
Thomas Whipp of the city's hazardous materials team.
   Hughes said firefighters spent about five hours at the home of
Ethel Back on Thursday. He believes the problem is caused by an acid
or a caustic, but that's about all investigators know.
   ``We can't figure out where it's coming from or how it got in
there,'' said Hughes. ``Right now, we're stymied.''
   He said he asked the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency to
investigate.
   Firefighters who entered the house reported a burning sensation
on their skin and an irritation in their throats.
   ``The odor smells acidic and leaves a metallic taste in your
mouth,'' said District Fire Chief Jerry Dyer.
   Ms. Back, her daughter and two grandchildren had left the house
and could not be reached for comment.
   Firefighters checked neighboring houses but didn't find other
evidence of contamination.
   Hughes said a quarter-sized hole that had appeared on one of the
family's mattresses last Saturday had grown to two feet in diameter
by Thursday.
   Whipp said that shortly after the family moved into the house a
month ago, the washing machine overflowed in the basement, soaking a
carpet on the floor. He speculated that the soap and water may have
reacted with something that was spilled on the carpet.
   Shortly after that incident, Whipp said, Ms. Back's daughter put
on a new dress.
   ``When she tried it on, the material started to fall away,'' said
Whipp. ``From this point on, every bit of clothing in the basement
... started to react.''
   Whipp said a grandson came home from school wearing a new pair of
blue jeans. ``The whole front thigh fell off of them,'' said Whipp.
   ``(Then) the cushion on the couch and arm on the couch started to
go away,'' he said.

   About 200 demonstrators gathered outside
Vienna's famed Burgtheater on Friday to protest the premiere of a
play critical of the Nazi past and Austria's treatment of Jews.
   Police increased security around the theater, but the
demonstration was peaceful and no incidents were reported.
   The tumult over Austrian playwright Thomas Bernhard's new play
``Heldenplatz'' _ or ``Heroes' Square'' _ has grabbed headlines for
weeks in a nation that takes its culture at least as seriously as
its politics.
   The title, ``Heldenplatz,'' is the name of a large Vienna square
where Adolf Hitler appeared in triumph to an estimated 1 million
jubilant fellow Austrians after the Nazi annexation in March 1938.
   Newspapers and state-run television have indulged in debates
about the freedom of the arts, which are heavily sponsored by
Austria's 7.5 million citizens in a country that sees subsidized
world-class opera, music and drama as part of the national heritage.
   During the first two acts of ``Heldenplatz'' Friday night, some
people in the theater called out ``Outrage!,'' but the interruptions
were immediately drowned out by demonstrative applause in support of
the performance, spectators said.
   Outside, protesters conducted heated discussions about the
freedom of art.
   Police officials said security has been stepped up inside and
outside the Burgtheater, a 100-year-old structure at the edge of the
Hofburg palace complex from which the Hapsburg family once ruled.
   Controversy over Bernhard's play first erupted when two popular
tabloids published what they billed as excerpts from his tale of a
Jewish family that emigrated in 1938, the year the Nazis annexed
Austria to the Third Reich, and returns to Vienna 50 years later.
   ``In Austria, you must be either National Socialist or
Catholic,'' one Jewish character was quoted as saying. ``Nothing
else is tolerated, everything else is destroyed.''
   Another widely attacked quote said to be from Bernhard's script
depicted Austria as ``a stage where everything has run to seed,
turned bad and decayed. A collection of 6{ million abandoned extras
who hate one another, 6{ million feeble, angry people who
continually shout for a director.''
   The storm of protest that ensued did nothing to hurt ticket
sales. Friday's premiere sold out in half an hour, and tickets for
the next 10 performances are hard to get.
   President Kurt Waldheim, whose own record as a German soldier in
World War II has sparked fierce debate about the Nazi past,
denounced Bernhard's play as ``a crass slander of the Austrian
people.''
   According to an excerpt from rehearsals broadcast Thursday on
Austrian radio, the play at one point brands Waldheim himself as ``a
cad.''
   Joerg Haider, head of the conservative Freedom Party, first
attacked Bernhard's play, then reputedly ordered tickets for the
premiere, sparking a running public argument with Burgtheater
director Klaus Peymann over who got the coveted first-night seats.
   Peter Sichrovsky, a respected Jewish author who has read
Bernhard's unpublished play, wrote a long article attacking the
drama in Friday's issue of Der Standard.
   ``It is a terrifyingly bad play,'' wrote Sichrovsky. ``Banal,
polemical, one-sided, falsifying, stupid and dangerous,'' he added,
attacking Bernhard's use of a ``synthetic'' Jew to attack Austria.
   Neither Bernhard nor Peymann are strangers to controversy in a
city that savors scandal in its world-renowned arts.
   Bernhard, an award-winning author in West Germany and his native
Austria, has been shocking his compatriots since 1955, when he wrote
what was considered a scandalous article criticizing the hallowed
musical scene in Salzburg, native town of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
   Peymann, a German, became embroiled in fierce controversy this
summer after he denounced the historic Burgtheater, its actors, and
Austrian politicians and cultural figures in a long interview with
the Hamburg weekly Die Zeit.
   The actors in his troupe split into two embittered camps whose
divisions were barely healed before scandal erupted anew over
Bernhard's play.

   President Reagan accused the
Democrats Friday of ``a new lack of civility'' and portrayed Michael
Dukakis as an inept governor who runs a state that is ``getting
sloppier and sloppier by the day.''
   The president campaigned for votes on behalf of the GOP ticket in
the battleground states of Illinois and New Jersey, mixing
get-out-the vote pitches with a Chicago bill-signing ceremony making
genocide a crime.
   In an afternoon stop at the Main Street Mall in this suburban
southern New Jersey community, Reagan bemoaned the mud-slingling
that has marked the Senate campaign between Sen. Frank R.
Lautenberg, who is seeking a second term, and his Republican
challenger Pete Dawkins.
   The match has been one of the most rancorous in the nation _
Dawkins has accused the senator of being a left-winger with a record
of little achievement while Lautenberg painted his rival, a one-time
Army brigadier general, as a carpetbagger.
   Reagan described both Dukakis and Lautenberg as ``far-out''
liberals who oppose a strong defense, tough judges and budget cuts.
   Reagan added: ``We've seen a lack of civility creeping into the
way the opposition in Congress operates.''
   Reagan made no mention of the charges voiced repeatedly by
Dukakis and his running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, that Bush
has pursued a campaign based on distortions and lies.
   In the same speech, Reagan did not mention Dukakis by name, but
he charged the Massachusetts governor with allowing his state to
rank ``an abysmal 30th'' in the annual rate of job growth in 1986
and 1987, and with overdrawing his state's bank ``by as much as $190
million for a month.''
   ``The Massachusetts mess is getting sloppier and sloppier by the
day,'' Reagan said. ``... You tell me, who's on your side, that
liberal governor or George Bush?''
   Earlier in the day, Reagan turned one of Dukakis' favorite
slogans to GOP use in a speech to several hundred GOP partisans at
Moraine Valley Community College about 20 miles from downtown
Chicago.
   The Democrats, Reagan argued, ``say they're on your side, but
that's just an empty promise. They promise _ but you know we
deliver.''
   ``If you want to know who's on the side of the little guy, well,
I'll tell you, it's the big guy, the big guy from Texas,'' Reagan
said.
   In his prepared remarks about the genocide treaty, Reagan made no
mention of the fact that U.S. participation in the pact had been
held up for nearly 40 years, primarily by a group of hard-core
conservatives unwilling to submit, as they argued, to a treaty that
sublimated American interests to an international pact.
   Others argued the language of the pact contained uncertainties
that could undermine the Constitution.
   While the United States signed the Genocide Convention in 1949,
legislation implementing the pact didn't pass the U.S. Senate until
last month.
   The bill makes genocide a crime, punishable by life in prison,
and defines it as the intentional destruction of national, ethnic,
racial or religious groups, in whole or in part.
   ``We gather today to bear witness to the past and learn from its
awful example to make sure we are not condemned to relive its
crimes,'' Reagan said at an impromptu signing ceremony staged at
Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.
   Instead of holding the ceremony in Washington on Thursday, as
White House officials had once indicated might be the case, Reagan's
schedulers opted for the Chicago site, only miles from the suburb of
Skokie, Ill., the community rocked by turmoil when right-wing Nazi
enthusiasts won the right to march in the streets of heavily Jewish
neighborhoods.
   The treaty marked a triumph for Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis.,
who had given more than 3,000 speeches over the past 19 years in
favor of the treaty. Fitzwater said the White House invited Proxmire
to the ceremony, but the senator was unable to attend.
   On Saturday, Reagan travels to the Detroit area for a Bush-Quayle
rally at Macomb Community College and to Mesquite, Texas, near
Dallas, for a GOP gathering in a rodeo arena.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president also
will make a one-day, cross-country trip on Monday for two events in
Southern California, a state with the largest electoral prize of 47
votes. The locations have not yet been announced, Fitzwater said.

   A funeral director accused of
mishandling 49 corpses, some of which were stacked for years in a
closet, pleaded guilty Friday to felony charges and was sentenced to
a year and a day in prison.
   Circuit Judge Lawrence P. Haddock also ordered him to surrender
his license.
   Lewis J. Howell, owner of the Howell Morning Glory Funeral
Chapel, pleaded guilty to three counts of grand theft as part of an
agreement with the district attorney's office. He was accused of
accepting money for burials that were never carried out and of
accepting money from the city for cremations that were never
performed.
   Prosecutors dropped two other grand theft counts and 36
misdemeanor counts of fraud.
   Howell wasn't ordered to make restitution because he doesn't have
the money, said E. McRae Mathis, assistant state attorney.
   In June, inspectors discovered 41 bodies at the funeral home.
Several were in a hearse parked outside, but most were found inside
the building, which lacks refrigeration equipment. None had been
embalmed, and some had been there so long only the bones remained.

<HEAD>Attorney: Bakker Not Surprised To Learn He's Target of Grand Jury</HEAD>

   PTL founder Jim Bakker was not surprised
when prosecutors sent him a letter telling him he was the target of
a 15-month federal grand jury investigation into the television
ministry's finances, an attorney said Friday.
   ``Obviously, when you're notified in writing, it's a cause of
concern,'' Ryan Hovis said when asked for his client's response to
the Oct. 24 letter from federal prosecutor Charles Alexander.
   ``This is not news to us, it's been known for the better part of
a year (that Bakker was a target),'' he said, adding it was not a
foregone conclusion that he would be indicted.
   The grand jury has been impaneled since August 1987 to
investigate allegations of mail and wire fraud, conspiracy and
criminal tax violations.
   Since that time, prosecutors have subpoenaed thousands of
documents to try to learn how Bakker operated the PTL and how he and
his aides spent millions of dollars in contributions from 1980-87.
   Bakker resigned as PTL president in March 1987 in the midst of a
sex-and-money scandal.
   Prosecutors are trying to determine whether Bakker and his
associates raised money on television and through the mail for one
purpose and spent it on another. They also want to know whether any
of the money was used for personal benefit.
   The Charlotte Observer reported Friday that PTL chief builder Roe
Messner and Richard Dortch, Bakker's former top aide, also received
letters informing them too were being investigated. Bakker, Messner
and Dortch were invited to appear before the 23-member grand jury
later this month. The letters said they were not compelled to
appear, but if they did, their testimony could be used against them.
   Hovis said he advised Bakker not to testify.
   Alexander, who has repeatedly denied the existence of the grand
jury investigation, was in Washington, D.C., on Friday, his
secretary said. He did not return phone calls.
   Bakker also did not return phone calls Friday.
   ``After careful review with my lawyers, I am respectfully
declining the invitation to appear before the PTL grand jury,'' he
said in an earlier statement.
   In August, Bakker denied any wrongdoing and said he doubted he
would be indicted.
   ``If I am, I'll be shocked,'' he said. ``If there is an
indictment, it'll be because somebody framed us and set us up.''
   Attorneys for Messner and Dortch did not return calls Friday
afternoon.

   The group holding Terry Anderson captive
said Friday the Reagan administration is blocking the release of
hostages by ignoring its messages.
   A statement delivered to a Western news agency said Washington
would not take ``realistic steps'' to end the ordeal of the 14
foreigners held hostage in Lebanon, nine of whom are Americans. It
said President Reagan was like ``the ostrich that hides her head in
the sand so that the hunter will not see her.''
   The typewritten statement in Arabic signed by Islamic Jihad, a
Shiite Moslem group loyal to Iran, was in a sealed envelope with a
blurry instant photograph of Anderson, the longest-held captive.
   It was the 14th photograph released of Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent of The Associated Press, since his abduction
March 16, 1985. He is shown with a mustache, wearing glasses and a
white T-shirt.
   He is behind a two-tier birthday cake with candles and appears
ready to cut into it. Oct. 27 was Anderson's 41st birthday, his
fourth in captivity.
   The picture apparently was made before a videotape released
Monday, in which Anderson said Reagan and Vice President George Bush
had not done enough to win his release.
   Anderson was clean-shaven in the videotape, in which he said the
date was Sunday.
   Islamic Jihad, Arabic for Islamic Holy War, also says it holds
Thomas Sutherland, 56, acting dean of agriculture at the American
University of Beirut, who was kidnapped June 9, 1985.
   It said in the statement delivered Friday: ``The only safe way to
the freedom of the captives and their safety is the implementation
of our just demands. This is the essential cornerstone in this
issue, nothing else.''
   No demands were given, but the group has said in the past that
Israel must free Arab prisoners and withdraw from a ``security
zone'' it maintains in south Lebanon.
   Another demand previously made is the release of 17 people
convicted and held in Kuwait for bombing the U.S. and French
embassies Dec. 3, 1983.
   Friday's document said the release of hostages is not connected
with a truce that began Aug. 20 in the 8-year-old Persian Gulf war
between Iran and Iraq.
   ``It has been also said that the cease-fire in the gulf will
speed up the release of the captives,'' it said. ``We repeat for a
thousandth time that the issue of the captives altogether is not in
any way linked to what happens in the gulf. Failure to free the
hostages is a result of the American heresy, procrastination and
reneging on pledges and promises.''
   The statement denied Reagan's assertion that the kidnappers
forced Anderson to read the videotaped statement, in which the
journalist accused Washington of interfering to stop his release. He
also said Reagan and Bush negotiated with terrorists in the
Iran-Contra affair and the 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner to
Beirut.
   Reagan denied bargaining with terrorists and said: ``I don't
think that was Terry speaking, I think he had a script that was
given to him.''
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said: ``Anytime you
have people being held hostage, tapes, letters, those kinds of
things are by definition under duress,'' he said.
   Bush denied involvement in Iran-Contra or negotiations with the
TWA hijackers, who held 39 Americans for 17 days and killed a U.S.
Navy diver. Israel released more than 700 Arab prisoners after the
hijackers freed the Americans, but denied a link.
   On Friday, Islamic Jihad said: ``The videotape, irrespective of
its contents, has been issued directly by Terry Anderson without any
pressure. ... The tape was made after sharp exchanges between him
and us about all the ideas he introduced, which we considered very
lacking.''
   The hostages ``are not isolated from the outside world,'' it
said. ``They see and hear the news from newspapers, magazines and
television stations. They are aware of everything that happened or
will happen about their situation.
   Hostages released previously reported having limited access to
news reports.
   Anderson ``will make an adequate answer'' to Reagan and Bush, the
statement said, but did not say when.
   Islamic Jihad accused the Reagan administration of ``cheating,
lying and misleading the American people and the families of the
hostages to head off any pressure on the American government to
embark upon realistic steps to resolve the question of the
hostages.''

<HEAD>FOMC Decided to Keep Interest Rates Unchanged in September</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Policymakers at the Federal Reserve, viewing
evidence that U.S. economic growth was slowing, decided at their
September meeting to leave interest rates unchanged, according to
minutes of the session released Friday.
   The Federal Open Market Committee, which establishes monetary
policy for the central bank, voted 12-0 to make no further moves to
tighten credit conditions.
   But officials let it be known that the central bank still
considered higher inflation a greater threat to the economy than a
possible recession.
   The Fed, whose main economic job is to guard against inflation,
began a series of credit-tightening steps late last March that
culminated in August with a one-half percentage point increase in
its discount rate, the interest it charges to make bank loans. The
discount rate now stands at 6.5 percent.
   But since that increase, many economists believe the central bank
has been willing to sit back and see if the credit-tightening moves
already initiated would be enough to dampen demand and cool any
dangers of overheating.
   The minutes of the Sept. 20 minute showed that Fed officials were
still taking a wait-and-see approach. The Fed officials said they
were encouraged by indications that economic growth was slowing from
the robust pace in the first half of the year.
   Indeed, the government has since reported that the overall
economy, as measured by the gross national product, expanded at a
modest 2.2 percent annual rate from July through September, down
from a 3.2 percent rate in the first half of the year.
   But even with signs that the economy was slowing, Fed officials
argued that it was too soon to declare a victory in the fight
against inflation.
   ``All of the members indicated that the balance of risks in the
economy were such that they favored or could accept a market
directive that would more readily accommodate a move toward firming
than an adjustment toward easing in the weeks ahead,'' the minutes
said.
   The FOMC minutes are used to direct the open market operations of
the Federal Reserve Bank in New York. Through the purchase of
government securities from banks, the Fed influences the amount of
reserves the banks have to make bank loans and thus the price of
those loans _ interest rates.
   While the vote for leaving monetary policy unchanged was
unanimous, the minutes indicated there was some dispute over just
how much further the Fed should go in fighting inflation.
   Some members of the policymaking group ``were less persuaded that
inflationary pressures would intensify, especially given the degree
of policy restraint that already had been implemented over the past
several months,'' the minutes said.
   These officials argued that the troubled condition of many banks
and savings and loan institutions could be adversely affected by
further increases in interest rates.
   Many economists expect that the Fed will begin pushing interest
rates up again sometime after Tuesday's election. They said the
report Friday that unemployment dropped to 5.3 percent in October,
matching a 14-year low, would renew concerns at the central bank
concerning tight labor markets and rising wage demands.
   ``Because the employment report was clearly strong, there is
little reason to believe that the Fed will back off any time soon
from its current policy of monetary restraint,'' said Thomas
Carpenter, chief economist for ASB Capital Management, a Washington,
D.C., investment firm.
   Fed officials met again this week to discuss monetary policy. The
minutes of that meeting will not be released until after the next
FOMC meeting on Dec. 13-14.

   The nation's largest defense contractors are
routinely billing the Pentagon for hundreds of millions of dollars
spent on outside consultants, frequently without justifying or
explaining the work they perform, a special audit has found.
   The Defense Department is itself partly to blame because its
procurement regulations are so vague, according to the report
released Friday by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.
   But the internal business discipline one would expect at a large
company for hiring outsiders is, ``in most cases, non-existent,''
the auditors added.
   In a review of 12 of the top 100 defense contractors, the
auditors labeled as ``questionable'' claims for $43 million out of
the $236.5 million charged to the government over the past year for
consultant services.
   If anything, the total for questionable claims is
``understated,'' the audit adds.
   The 12 companies picked by the auditors included the Boeing Co.,
General Dynamics Corp., Hughes Aircraft Co., IBM Inc., Litton
Industries Inc., Lockheed Corp., Martin Marietta Corp., McDonnell
Douglas Corp., Northrop Corp., Raytheon Co., UNISYS Corp., and the
United Technologies Corp.
   ``At five locations we encountered specific facts which caused us
to suspect irregular activity and referred the matters to the
appropriate investigative agencies,'' the audit said. It did not
identify the five sites.
   An IBM spokeswoman, Suzanne Garvey, said the company had been
told by the auditors that IBM ``is not among five companies facing
criminal investigation over use of consultants.''
   Often, contractors simply could not explain what work their
consultants had performed, the auditors wrote. And in some cases, it
appears the consultants performed lobbying or publicity work that
should not have been reimbursed.
   The DCAA audit, spawned by a massive fraud investigation at the
Pentagon, paints a picture of a clubby atmosphere in which major
contractors rarely ask that consultant contracts be put in writing
and frequently hire consultants without soliciting competitive bids.
   The DCAA also expressed concern about the number of consultants
it encountered ``who were former high-level ... military and
civilian personnel'' at the department.
   ``We found that contractors were spending considerable sums
supplementing and complementing virtually every in-house activity
with professional and consultant services,'' the auditors wrote.
   Under existing regulations, the auditors continued, a defense
contractor may bill the government for its expenses on outside
consultants as long as it can show ``evidence of the nature and
scope of the service furnished.''
   That standard is so loose that it does not force contractors to
truly document what they are paying for or to demonstrate how the
work benefits the military, the audit concluded.
   The Pentagon, in releasing the audit, announced it had already
written new regulations to address the DCAA's concerns. A public
comment period on the new regulations will end Dec. 5, at which
point they can be made final, the Pentagon said.
   The DCAA audit was ordered last July 25 by Defense Secretary
Frank C. Carlucci in the aftermath of disclosures that federal
prosecutors were conducting a wide-ranging fraud investigation
focusing on contractors and their outside consultants along with
selected Pentagon employees.
   The 2-year-old investigation centers on allegations that
consultants paid bribes to Defense Department officials to gather
inside information that was useful to companies bidding on
multimillion-dollar projects.
   While no charges have been filed as yet, indictments are now
expected later this month.

<TEXT>
   The military government on Friday dismissed
political party demands that an interim government be formed to
supervise a proposed general election.
   Government spokesman Kyaw Sann told a news briefing, ``Some
parties are demanding formation of an interim government to hold a
free and fair election. With 104 parties now registered, with whom
do they intend to form an interim government? This government,
independent of party politics, is the best interim government for
the country.
   ``We will definitely hold a free and fair general election as
soon as law and order is restored.''.
   He said that from 1958-60, the army served as a caretaker
government, held a free election and handed power to a civilian
government.
   ``Some parties are even advocating armed revolution and liaising
between above-ground and underground elements. We are prepared to
meet such a challenge,'' he said, without elaborating.
   Pro-democracy groups began calling for a provisional government
after street protests toppled hard-line ruler President Sein Lwin on
Aug. 12.
   Opposition leaders believed they were close to getting
concessions from new President Maung Maung, but military commander
Gen. Saw Maung seized power in a Sept. 18 coup and ordered his
troops to fire on protesters in a bloody crackdown on dissent.
Hundreds were killed.
   Saw Maung promised that elections pledged by Maung Maung would be
held, but set no date. He allowed formation of political parties,
ending a quarter century in which only one legal party existed in
Burma.
   No foreign countries have officially recognized Saw Maung's
government.
   In London on Friday, Britain's minister for overseas development,
Chris Patten, told the House of Commons that Britain has frozen $1.8
million in development aid to Burma as a result of the political
situation in the Southeast Asian country.
   Patten said the Burmese military regime's pledge to hold
democratic multiparty elections should be honored ``as soon as
possible.'' He also said the military government was continuing to
purge those involved in August and September demonstrations.

<HEAD>Appellate Panel Keeps Official English Measure on Ballot</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal appellate panel refused Friday to take off
the ballot a proposal to make English the state's official language,
rejecting the argument that the citizens' initiative violated voting
rights law.
   Opponents of the initiative, backed by a Justice Department
brief, had asked the three judges at a hearing Thursday to block
Tuesday's vote on the measure. They contended that official English
backers violated the Voting Rights Act by not distributing their
petitions in Spanish in heavily Hispanic precincts.
   The 2-1 appellate ruling, announced by the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Atlanta, upheld a lower court decision keeping
the proposal, Amendment 11, on the ballot.
   Florida English, the initiative's sponsor, contended that the
petitions were a private action and not subject to the Voting Rights
Act's provisions ensuring that the government provide equal access
to the ballot box for all citizens.
   That was the conclusion of U.S. District Judge James W. Kehoe in
his ruling last week, and was also the decision of a federal appeals
court hearing a similar Colorado case.
   Florida English collected more than 500,000 signatures to put the
initiative on the ballot, and according to the latest polls, it is
favored by a large majority of the state's voters. Many top state
officials are campaigning against it, however.

   ``Today'' show weatherman Willard Scott
fulfilled a promise, even though he didn't make the promise, with a
half-day visit Friday that made up for a hoax.
   ``What do you say, gang?'' Scott called out to about 100
autograph hounds at a bookstore in the town of about 3,500.
   After about 30 minutes in the store, the jovial television
personality emerged with his lapels draped with Georgia Bulldogs
stickers and buttons. ``Yeah, I'm a bulldog, a hot dog,'' he said.
   Asked if he predicted the warm, overcast weather, he replied:
``Well, at least it isn't snowing.''
   In late July a woman visited the St. Marys-Kingsland area for 10
days and said she was with NBC.
   Local officials said she began making plans for Scott and NBC
newsman John Palmer to do a documentary on the community impact of
the Navy's Kings Bay submarine base.
   Residents were looking forward to greeting Scott.
   But NBC officials said the woman did not work for the network.
The plan was a hoax.
   Of the mystery woman, Scott said: ``Little did she know that she
was dealing with King Kong when she made a promise in my name. I've
never let anybody make a promise in my name that I didn't fulfill in
some way.''
   St. Marys Mayor Ward Hernandez said the town ``enjoyed having
Willard down with us'' and said Scott was considering a return visit.

<TEXT>
   Police found and defused a homemade
bomb near General Electric Co.'s administrative office Friday, three
days after a bomb explosion slightly damaged the building.
   Jesus Garcia, head of the police department's explosives
division, said the bomb found Friday near a building adjacent to the
General Electric office was much more dangerous than a pipe bomb
that exploded Tuesday, shattering windows in the company's downtown
building.
   An obscure pro-independence group claimed responsibility for
Tuesday's explosion, which caused no injuries.
   No group claimed responsibility for the device found Friday, but
police said both bombs where placed at the same time.
   ``This device, based on our evaluations, was placed the same
night as the one that exploded in the facilities of General
Electric,'' Garcia said, adding that the second bomb ``could have
exploded at any time if it was bumped or disturbed.''
   On Wednesday, a group calling itself the Pedro Albizu Campos
Revolutionary Forces claimed responsibility for the explosion. The
group is named after a Puerto Rican nationalist of the 1930s.
   A communique from the group left near a San Juan news agency said
the act was ``in support of the just struggle of our people against
the criminal Yankee corporations that daily contaminate and poison
our waters ... slowly killing us.''
   Puerto Rico, an island of 3.3 million mostly Spanish-speaking
people, has been a U.S. territory since 1898 and a commonwealth
since 1952. Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, but they pay no U.S.
taxes and cannot vote for president.

<HEAD>Italian Claims British Soccer Fans Intended To Kill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Italian survivor of the Heysel
stadium riots said in a statement read Friday at the trial of 24
Britons charged with manslaughter, ``I was convinced they really
intended to kill someone.''
   Stefano Galliciani said British fans rampaged across terraces at
the stadium wielding sticks, bottles and iron bars.
   Galliciani had come to the Brussels stadium on May 29, 1985 to
support Juventus Turin, playing in the European soccer cup final
against Liverpool. Before the game started, 39 people, mostly
Italians, died in a stampede which has been blamed on a charge into
their ranks by British supporters.
   Twenty-four Liverpool men are on trial, charged with
manslaughter. Two more stayed in England, where they are facing
other charges.
   Galliciani identified Stephen McDonald, a 21-year-old apprentice
electrician, from newspaper pictures as one leading suspect, saying
``I was shocked by the hate and ferocity with which he attacked
people who were just trying to escape.''
   McDonald denied he took part in any violence.
   ``I did not go to Belgium with the intention of causing any
trouble,'' he told the court. ``I was distressed at the tragedy that
happened. But I don't feel responsibility. I feel sympathy for the
Italian families.''
   McDonald earlier told British police he just tried to help
English supporters under attack from Italians.
   He told Judge Pierre Verlynde he found himself among Italian
supporters and suggested to another Liverpool fan, Terry Wilson,
that they move into the Liverpool section because Italian fans were
staring at them. ``I felt threatened and uneasy,'' McDonald said.
   The third week of the trial ended Friday with no clearer evidence
that any British supporter was directly and personally responsible
for the death of the Italians. The Britons were charged after being
identified on videotapes made at the 1985 match. The trial is
expected to last until Christmas.
   Belgian law does not acknowledge collective guilt.
   Three Belgian officials and two police officers are also on trial
for criminal neglect in organizing the match. So are two European
Soccer Union officials.
   The Heysel tragedy was the bloodiest event in the history of
European sports. It created such a shock in Belgium that the
government later resigned.

   President Reagan, signing legislation implementing
U.S. participation in a treaty banning genocide, noted Friday that
the timing was ``particularly fitting'' because Wednesday was the
50th anniversary of Kristallnacht, a mass attack by Nazis against
Jews in Germany and Austria.
   Along with the legislation, the president signed a proclamation
declaring this week as a Week of Remembrance of the event, which
many consider the beginning of the Holocaust.
   Kristallnacht is translated as ``night of the broken glass.'' On
that night, the windows of many Jewish-owned shops were shattered
and Jewish homes and synagogues were desecrated.

<HEAD>World War II Bombing Ace Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air Marshal Sir Harold Martin, one of the daredevil
pilots who made the famous ``dam buster'' raid on Germany in World
War II, has died at age 70, his family announced Friday.
   His family said the war hero, whose decorations included three
separate awards of the Distinguished Flying Cross, the highest Royal
Air Force honor, died Thursday at his home in London. No cause of
death was given.
   Martin and his comrades, all experts at low-level bombing, flew
into a wall of enemy fire at a height of only 60 feet in 1943 and
dropped bouncing bombs in a night raid intended to breach dams and
flood the industrial Ruhr Valley.
   Their exploits were recorded in the 1954 movie named ``The Dam
Busters'' for the nickname of RAF Squadron 617.
   Martin was born in Australia and as a young man was ruled unfit
to fly in that country because he suffered from asthma.
   He came to Britain and became a bomber pilot, first with a
squadron of Australian Hampden bombers operating with the RAF, then
with an RAF squadron flying Lancasters. Martin quickly realized the
value of flying low to evade enemy fighters and set about perfecting
low-level skills.
   In 1943, he joined Squadron 617, the Dam Busters team assembled
by the late Wing Commander Guy Gibson to attack the heavily defended
Mohne, Eder and Sorpe dams.
   Martin helped train the team in dangerous maneuvers that included
dodging power lines and treetops, and on May 15, 1943, flew one of
the 18 Lancaster bombers that made the raid.
   The planes carried bombs invented by scientist Barnes Wallis that
were designed to be dropped exactly 60 feet, bounce across the water
to avoid anti-mine nets, then sink against the dam and explode.
   In the attack on the Mohne dam, Martin's bomb struck accurately
but German gunners hit his plane. Two shells exploded in a wing fuel
tank, but it was empty and the plane flew on.
   Despite repeated attacks, the Mohne dam appeared to have held,
but then water began pouring through a widening breach and Martin
was heard shouting: ``Hell, it's gone! It's gone!''
   The Mohne and Eder dams were breached and the Sorpe dam damaged,
causing widespread destruction but not the hoped-for mortal blow to
power and water supplies.
   Later in the war, Martin became a master of low-level night raids
on airfields and of low-level marking, dropping flares to indicate
targets for heavy-omber attacks.
   Martin was RAF commander in West Germany and chief of NATO's 2nd
Allied Tactical Air Force in 1970-73 and retired in 1974.
   His wife and two daughters survive.

   Here are excerpts from the remarks of Vice President George Bush,
the Republican presidential nominee, at appearances in Fairfield,
Conn., Cincinnati and Livonia, Mich.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   
   Fairfield:
   
   ``Dukakis has led his state into what the Boston Herald headline
on Wednesday called an economic `mess'.
   ``That's what's happening to what used to be called the
Massachusetts miracle. Regrettably it turns out to be a mirage.
   ``He got into it by overspending. How did he get out of it or try
to? By raising taxes a total of $180 million this year alone. ...
Now he's borrowing like mad, writing checks that he doesnt' even
have enough money in the bank to cover.
   ``He may want to be on your side but I don't think that the
American people want to be on his side.''
   
   Cincinnati:
   
   ``My pitch to Democrats in Ohio and independents and Republicans
is vote for the mainstream. Do not vote for the extreme.
   ``Vote for the mainstream and I represent your values, your
neighborhoods, your families. And so I am asking the American people
in these four days before the election, give me a mandate for the
mainstream.''
   
   Livonia:
   
   ``This national election has got the clearest philosophical
choice of any in modern times. And the differences between me and
the governor are deep as the Great Divide.
   ``I figured it out on the plane. We've got about 72 hours more of
campaigning before the campaigning part ends. And the pundits talk
about who's going to win, but let me tell you something. It's the
people who decide.
   ``You're looking at three tired people, here Barbara my wife and
me and our daughter, Dorothy. And we've been going all over this
country. But it has been a tremendous experience. We have a
wonderful country and its heart beats true and it is still a place
of wonder. And I love this country. And I want to stand beside her
and guide her. And I ask for your vote.''

   Sikh militants killed 42 people and
wounded 54 Friday in a series of bombings at a crowded market and an
attack on a farm in Punjab state, police and news reports said.
   A police spokesman in the state capital of Chandigarh said 26
people were killed and 50 wounded when seven bombs exploded in rapid
succession at the crowded market of a Hindu neighborhood in Batala,
north of Amritsar. He blamed the blasts on Sikhs.
   Five hours later, six Sikh gunmen in a truck opened fire, killing
16 workers and wounding four at a seed farm near Lawdohwal in the
Ludhiana district about 80 miles southeast of Amritsar, the United
News of India and the Press Trust of India reported.
   The Sikh militants' campaign of violence for a separate nation
has claimed at least 2,206 lives in Punjab state this year.
   Friday's attacks came four days before Diwali, a major Hindu
holiday. Authorities have stepped up security for fear of an
escalation of sectarian attacks timed to disrupt festivities.
   The police spokesman in Chandigarh, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the bombs in Batala were so powerful that many of
the victims were dismembered.
   Batala police chief S.M. Sharma said some of the explosives were
concealed in two sewing machines which were left on bicycles 200
yards apart.
   He said 4,000 paramilitary troops were deployed in the Batala
area in case of a Hindu backlash of violence.
   ``We have imposed curfew in the area. The situation is very, very
tense,'' Sharma said. He said 22 Hindus, three Sikhs and a Christian
were killed in the blasts.
   The police spokesman said the state's borders with Haryana and
Jammu-Kashmir were sealed after the blasts and a state-wide alert
had been announced. No arrests were reported.
   Batala, 32 miles north of the Sikh holy city of Amritsar, has a
population of about 150,000. Hindus outnumber Sikhs in the town and
control the trade.
   Sikh radicals in Punjab claim they are discriminated against by
Hindus, India's religious majority, and need a separate homeland to
preserve their religion and culture.
   Sikhs make up about two percent of India's 880 million people,
but they are a majority in Punjab.
   On Thursday, Sikh radicals ambushed a bus and killed 11
passengers at Gujarpura, 27 miles northeast of Amritsar.

   Michael Dukakis pulled to within seven points of
George Bush in a national survey Friday, trimming the Republican's
lead from double digits earlier in the week.
   With four days before the presidential election, Dukakis narrowed
the gap by improving his standing among older Americans and by
attracting two-thirds of the voters who decided this week, the CBS
News poll found.
   There was room for other changes: Of the 1,343 probable voters
who were surveyed from Tuesday through Thursday, 24 percent either
said they could change their minds, only leaned toward a candidate
or were undecided.
   The poll put the race at 51-44 percent, including leaners. That
was down from a 12-point Bush lead, 53-41 percent, in a CBS News
poll done Oct. 29 through Monday.
   The election is Tuesday.
   Only about 4 percent of the probable voters made up their minds
in the last few days, but two-thirds of them went for Dukakis, the
poll found.
   The Democrat trailed just by 47-45 percent among probable voters
aged 45 and over; younger voters favored Bush by 54-42 percent.
   Bush and his running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle, won support from 87
percent of the Republicans in the poll, 55 percent of independents
and 22 percent of Democrats. Dukakis and his running mate, Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen, were backed by 73 percent of the Democrats polled, 34
percent of independents and 11 percent of the Republicans.
   Eleven percent of the independents were undecided, as were 5
percent of the Democrats and 2 percent of the Republicans.
   The poll's margin of error was plus or minus three percentage
points.

<HEAD>Union Brawl Points Up Mexican Governing Party's Problems</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rival union factions turned a leading tourist
hotel into a blazing battleground _ the second such incident this
week _ in what was seen Friday as a dramatic sign of struggle inside
Mexico's weakened governing party.
   One man died of a gunshot wound to the head and seven were
injured Thursday night in a huge brawl and shootout at Mexico City's
37-story Hotel Presidente Chapultepec that left the lobby a sea of
shattered glass and broken palm trees.
   Authorities said 189 people were arrested. They estimated up to
600 unionists took part in the fracas.
   Hotel officials and police said no guests or employees were hurt.
   ``The workers movement is trying to enhance its political
position using disorder and violence,'' Jose Maria Alverde, a
leading businessman in the capital, was quoted as saying by the
Excelsior news service.
   Witnesses and officials said gangs from rival union factions
charged into the hotel lobby through separate entrances at about
9:30 p.m. Thursday.
   The unionists lobbed firebombs, fired shots, broke plate glass,
rampaged through offices and struggled with police.
   Guests ran for their rooms. Hotel employees took cover or tried
to barricade the shattered entrances with furniture.
   ``There was a lot of screaming. We heard gunshots. We looked up
and the lobby was filled with white smoke,'' said Paul Gregory, a
lighting designer from New York City.
   Police and Red Cross officials had said Thursday that two people
had died, but on Friday the official toll from the prosecutor's
office was revised to one dead and the number of injured was put at
seven.
   The hotel on Chapultepec Park is one of the city's finest.
   The battle came four days after a union clash at the Acapulco
Plaza resort hotel in Acapulco left two dead. Violence there flared
after the national Mexican Workers Federation tried to replace a
local union leader.
   ``Nobody is in control anymore. Everybody is fighting for his own
survival,'' political analyst Adolfo Aguilar said.
   The confrontation pits members of the Mexican Workers Federation
against one of its own affiliates, the Revolutionary Federation of
Workers and Campesinos. The Revolutionary Federation holds the
musician's contract at the Presidente Chapultepec.
   The unions are key blocs in the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which was shaken by heavy losses in the
July 6 election. The Workers Federation lost strength in Congress
and union leaders fear that reforms promised by President-elect
Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who takes office Dec. 1, will further sap
their power.
   Jockeying for power and membership within the unions was viewed
as one result.
   ``It is a sign of deterioration, that the confrontation is
worsening,'' said analyst Aguilar in a telephone interview from
Washington, where he is on a Carnegie Foundation fellowship.
   Fidel Velasquez, 88-year-old head of the Workers Federation,
denied his group was at fault, saying the union had ``abolished its
programs of violence.'' He did not say what those programs were.
   ``We will reply blow-for-blow to anything they want to dish
out,'' said Isidoro Mendoza de la Cruz, a congressman and member of
the Revolutionary Federation.
   Cesar Garcia Lara, a spokesman for the national Confederation of
Chambers of Commerce, called on Salinas to curb the unions before
they hurt Mexico's vital tourism industry and tarnish the country's
international image.
   PRI officials had no immediate comment Friday, but they have
repeatedly denied any rift between the new party leadership and the
unions.

<HEAD>Church Suspends Lord Chancellor for Attending Mass</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Scottish Protestant church suspended
the lord chancellor, Britain's highest-ranking law officer, from his
post as a church elder Friday because he attended the Roman Catholic
funerals of two colleagues.
   Lord Mackay, the lord chancellor, also was barred from taking
Communion.
   The small Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland regards the
Catholic Mass as idolatrous and the pope as the anti-Christ. It
acted after a court of elders heard that Mackay attended two
Catholic funerals.
   Mackay, 61, an elder of the church's Edinburgh kirk, or church,
said that in attending the funerals of Lords Russell and Wheatley,
``I did nothing to indicate support for the doctrine of Roman
Catholicism.''
   ``I went there purely with the purpose of paying my respects to
my dead colleagues and to give public expression of sympathy to
their relatives,'' Mackay said.
   He said he had no regrets about attending the funerals and would
appeal the sentences.
   The lord chancellor is a Cabinet member and presides over the
House of Lords, the unelected upper house of Parliament, including
the Law Lords, the highest court of appeal in the British legal
system.
   Mackay's church has between 4,000 and 5,000 members and 20
congregations. It was formed in 1893 when it broke away from the
Free Church of Scotland, itself a splinter of Scotland's main
denomination, the Church of Scotland.

   Leftist guerrillas bombed four banks and shot
it out with police Friday in the heaviest urban guerrilla violence
in months, leaving three rebels and three officers wounded, police
said.
   They said rebels from the pro-Cuba Tupac Amaru Revolutionary
Movement exploded six bombs at the state-owned banks in morning
attacks, breaking windows and damaging doors and furniture but
causing no injuries.
   The bombings were carried out in two working-class neighborhoods.
   Later, rebels in cars fired machine guns in two attacks at two
pairs of officers, who returned fire, police said.
   Three rebels in one car were wounded when a patrolman raked the
car with machine-gun fire, but the guerrillas escaped, the police
said.
   The police said the rebels left leaflets protesting government
austerity measures and hailing the 208th anniversary Friday of a
failed rebellion against Spanish rule staged by Tupac Amaru, a rebel
Indian leader and national hero.
   It was the worst rebel violence in Lima since the Tupac Amaru
fired mortars at the U.S. Embassy residence June 9, causing minor
damage but no injuries.
   Attacks by the organization have been infrequent since government
forces arrested key leaders and crushed a guerrilla front in the
eastern jungles a year ago.
   The Tupac Amaru group began its attacks in 1984. It is smaller
and considered less violent than the Shining Path, a fanatical,
Mao-inspired movement that has been fighting since 1980 to overthrow
Peru's elected government. No known links exist between the groups.
   Urban attacks by the Shining Path also have dropped off in recent
months.

   A tornado inflicted an estimated $1 million in damage in
southwestern Florida on Friday while rain fell over much of the
East, the northern Plains and the Northwest.
   Colorado's mountains received snow, and police said two people
died in a weather-related car accident 40 miles west of Denver.
   In Fort Meyers, Fla., county disaster officials estimated damages
at $1 million Friday after a tornado spawned by overnight heavy
thunderstorms touched down after 1 a.m. in a residential area.
   Nearly 100 homes were damaged, but no serious injuries were
reported in the Gulf Coast community, authorities said.
   Small hail fell near Cape Girardeau, Mo., and marble-size hail
hit Mountain Home, Ark.
   A high wind warning was posted in southeast Wyoming, where winds
were expected to gust to more than 60 mph. A wind advisory also was
posted over the mountains of central California.
   Advisories for snow along with blowing and drifting snow were
posted over the northern and central mountains of Colorado, with 2
or 3 inches of snow expected Friday, with winds reaching 20 to 40
mph with stronger gusts.
   Gusty winds and snow also continued over the Laramie Range in
southeast Wyoming. About an inch of new snow was reported Friday
morning near Vedauwoo and near Crystal Reservoir.
   In San Antonio, Texas, the temperature reached 92 degrees,
breaking the city's 90-degree record for the date, set in 1948.
   The low in the nation Friday morning was 21 degres at Concord,
N.H.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 31
degrees at Yellowstone, Wyo., to 96 degrees at McAllen, Texas.
   Saturday's forecast called for snow extending from eastern
Minnesota into northwest Wisconsin, changing to rain over the
remainder of the Great Lakes, from Illinois through the Ohio Valley
and across the Appalachians and the Atlantic states from Maine
through the Virginias.
   Showers and thunderstorms will extend from the Carolinas across
much of Florida, the Tennessee Valley and eastern Alabama, and over
the northern Pacific coast. Winds will be strong and gusty over the
central Plains and the mid-Mississippi Valley.
   Highs will be in the 30s over much of Minnesota and eastern North
Dakota; in the 40s and 50s from New England across the Appalachians,
the Ohio Valley, much of the Great Lakes, upper and middle
Mississippi Valley and central Plains, upper Missouri Valley,
northern Rockies and northern Washington state.
   Temperatures will reach the 80s over much of the Florida
peninsula and southern Texas, and from the southern half of
California across southern Nevada and southern Arizona. Highs will
reach near 90 degrees from the Los Angeles area through the desert
Southwest. High temperatures over the remainder of the nation will
generally reach the 60s and 70s.

<TEXT>
   A group of Greek and West German human
rights activists gathered at an Ankara court Friday and unfurled
banners calling for amnesty for hundreds of prisoners charged with
political crimes.
   Officials said 24 people were detained.
   Twenty of those arrested will be deported Saturday and the four
others will await a court hearing Monday, the semi-official Anatolia
News Agency said.
   It quoted Mehmet Agar, the Ankara chief of security, as saying 12
Greeks and eight West Germans would be deported Saturday, placed
aboard the first flights out of Ankara.
   The agency reported Agar said four Greeks being held until Monday
will be prosecuted on charges of staging a political demonstration
during a trial. If conviced they could be sentenced to at least six
months in jail. Anatolia identified them as Georgios Kuidis,
Nikolaos Beladilas, Georgios Kurtis and Kostantinos Nikiforakis.
   Four other foreigners, two West German paliamentarians, a West
German journalist and Gerasimos Zarkadis, a correspondent for the
Athens News Agency, also were picked up but were released after a
few hours, Anatolia said. It did not identify the West Germans.
   Aristidis Kalegeropoulus Stratis, press attache at the Greek
Embassy, said the activists were in Ankara to observe the Dev-Yol
trials that have been going on for seven years.
   Dev-Yol, or Revolutionary Road, was one of the largest leftist
underground groups before the 1980 military takeover. Most of its
members were arrested after the coup and others fled abroad.
   More than 700 suspected Dev-Yol members are being tried on
charges of political killings and attempting to stage a communist
takeover. Seventy-four face death sentences if convicted.
   Legal authorities say the court will not be able to announce the
verdicts for another year. The defense is now presenting its case.
   In a related development, hundreds of prisoners are participating
in hunger strikes at Turkish jails to protest long legal proceedings
and demand better conditions, it was reported Friday.
   Gulten Sesen, who acts as a spokeswoman for the prisoners'
relatives, told The Associated Press that about 300 inmates in the
central province of Eskisehir began fasting 17 days ago.
   She said at least 250 prisoners in the southeastern province of
Diyarbakir began fasting 13 days ago, and on Wednesday 300 inmates
in Istanbul's Sagmalcilar prison joined the hunger strike.
   She said the prisoners are taking liquids only and among their
demands are more access to lawyers and relatives and permission to
write letters and use musical instruments.
   The Istanbul newspaper Milliyet said Friday that 12
hunger-striking inmates in Eskisehir had been hospitalized.
   About 50 friends and relatives of the fasting inmates held a
sit-in at Parliament to protest what they called ``inhuman
restrictions'' in prisons. Officials reported 20 were detained and

   A Virginia photographer jailed in Spain on
cocaine trafficking charges that U.S. officials say stemmed from his
set up by drug smugglers will be transferred to the U.S. on Monday,
U.S. and Spanish officials said Friday.
   Helga Soto, spokeswoman for the Spanish Embassy, said Conan Owen
of nearby Annandale, Va., would be released from a Barcelona prison
and turned over to U.S. authorities. She could not provide any
further details on the release.
   A U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told
The Associated Press on Friday that Monday is the expected date of
transfer for Owen to the United States.
   ``We do not discuss prisoner transfers at this time,'' said John
Russell, a Justice Department spokesman. Russell said it is the
department's policy not to discuss such matters until the transfers
take place.
   Family members were not immediately available for comment.
   Spanish Embassy officials announced Oct. 28 that Owen, 24, would
be transferred to the United States to complete his six-year
sentence. U.S. officials have the authority to parole him after he
serves one-third of his prison sentence.
   The Owen family has waged a campaign to convince U.S. authorities
that their son had been duped into acting as a drug courier.
   Their efforts eventually led a federal prosecutor in Alexandria,
Va., a Drug Enforcement Administration agent in Madrid, DEA
Administrator John C. Lawn and ultimately then-Attorney General
Edwin Meese III to conclude that Owen was innocent of the
trafficking charges.
   An Alexandria resident, George Barahona, admitted in February
that he and others _ without Owen's knowledge _ hid four pounds of
cocaine in a false bottom of a suitcase that they then asked Owen to
take to Barcelona.
   In April 1987, however, a court in Barcelona found Owen guilty of
drug trafficking, sentencing him to six years and a day in prison
and imposing an $18,000 fine. In a written opinion, the judges said
they rejected Barahona's confession because it was obtained as part
of a plea bargain, which is illegal in Spain.
   Owen became eligible to return to the United States under an
international treaty governing exchanges of sentenced prisoners.

<HEAD>Crackdown on Diplomats Has Reduced Unpaid Parking Tickets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Diplomats in London have been more careful about
paying their parking tickets since the government launched a
crackdown that led to the expulsion of a Tunisian envoy in August.
   The Foreign Office said Friday that the diplomatic corps held 42
percent fewer unpaid parking tickets in the first half of 1988
compared to the same period last year.
   But some offenders have been slow to clean up their act.
   A Foreign Office spokesman said Egypt still leads the list for a
second year although it had fewer unpaid traffic tickets this time _
368 in the first half of 1988 compared with 426 in 1987.
   He said the Soviet Union ranks second, with an increase from 271
to 324 tickets, and Poland is third, with an increase from 150 to
213 tickets.
   The spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Britain
would be ``underlining our concern'' to the 10 worst offenders, who
accounted for 35 percent of the total unpaid tickets.
   He said diplomats had 5,838 unpaid tickets in the first six
months of 1988, compared with 10,096 in the same period in 1987 and
nearly 67,000 in 1984.
   The drop follows a Foreign Office campaign against law-breaking
diplomats. In August, Britain expelled a Tunisian envoy who failed
to pay hundreds of dollars in parking fines. A standard parking
ticket in London costs $21.
   Three diplomats _ Cuba's ambassador, a Cuban attache and a
Vietnamese envoy _ also were expelled during one week in September
for firearms violations.

<HEAD>Lisa Steinberg's Biological Mother Breaks Silence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The biological mother of Lisa Steinberg, whose
beating death focused national attention on child abuse, said Friday
she is attending the adoptive father's murder trial because she
feels she must, despite her hatred of him.
   Michele Launders, 27, who had Lisa as a teen-ager, gave her up to
Joel Steinberg thinking the lawyer would find her a good home.
Steinberg kept and raised the girl, and is accused of killing the
6-year-old girl with a severe beating last November.
   ``I hate the man. He's not a man to me _ he's not human,'' said
Ms. Launders, breaking her silence to discuss the case.
   Ms. Launders, who lives in an undisclosed Nassau County town,
attends the trial daily. A family friend, retired police officer
Steve Dickson, serves as her armed bodyguard.
   ``It's just something I have to do,'' she said, adding that she
is undergoing psychotherapy, feels tremendous guilt and thinks of
the child every night.
   Steinberg, 47, a disbarred lawyer, is on trial for second-degree
murder. He denies that he hit the child. He says she choked on
vomited food and maintains the bruises on her chest and back
resulted from his trying to revive her.
   When Ms. Launders and Steinberg make eye contact, as they have
several times during the trial, ``I just stare right back,'' she
said. ``I do expect and hope that there will be a conviction; that
would be justice, because I feel he's guilty.''
   She added that 25 years to life in prison, the maximum sentence
that Steinberg faces, would be inadequate.
   Ms. Launders watched Thursday as a 5{-minute videotape revealed
the bruises, open wounds, patches of missing hair and discolored
left leg that Hedda Nussbaum, 46, then Steinberg's live-in
companion, suffered around the time of Lisa's death.
   Prosecutors believe the videotape shows the allegedly violent
conditions in the household and offers an explanation as to why Ms.
Nussbaum did not call for help for at least 10 hours after Lisa
became unconscious.
   ``It was very disturbing. She suffered a lot herself,'' Ms.
Launders said of Ms. Nussbaum.
   ``I don't blame her. But I still feel she (Ms. Nussbaum) could
have prevented it,'' she said of Lisa's death. ``I wouldn't say I
feel sorry for her. She put herself in that situation.''
   Asked about an agreement to drop charges against Ms. Nussbaum in
exchange for her testimony, Ms. Launders said: ``I wasn't happy with
it. But if it will help convict Steinberg, sure.''
   Lisa, whom Steinberg obtained as a newborn, was taken to St.
Vincent's Hospital shortly after 6:30 a.m. on Nov. 2, 1987. She died
three days later of a head injury.
   Ms. Launders, an insurance underwriter, said she has worked only
1{ months in the past year. ``My mind just isn't there yet. I can't
concentrate on work.''

   The narrow hallway that leads to the ``Today''
show studio is suddenly filled with guys in blue suits.
   Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis is swept down
the hall within a phalanx of advance men, advisers and Secret
Service agents. Trailing slightly behind the group is his makeup
woman.
   Dukakis' live appearance Friday morning capped two full days of
NBC's ``Today'' show devoted to the presidential election. Friday's
show was on the the Massachusetts governor, Thursday's on the
Republican nominee, Vice President George Bush.
   When it's close to time for Dukakis' interview with host Bryant
Gumbel, the candidate comes into the studio during a commercial
break and chats with weatherman Joe Witte. Then he settles into a
chair opposite Gumbel. Somebody hands him a cup of coffee in a
``Today'' show mug. He and Gumbel exchange small talk while Witte
does the weather, helpfully describing conditions for Dukakis' later
appearance at a rally in Queens as, ``if I remember my tourist
Greek, `kala,' which is `good.'''
   Underdog Dukakis has been blitzing the talk shows in the waning
days of the campaign, though Bush has often been matching him show
for show. Live interviews with the two took up the last half hour of
the respective Thursday and Friday ``Today'' shows.
   ``It's something we felt we had to do as a service to the
voters,'' said ``Today'' executive producer Marty Ryan. ``All the
campaign rhetoric that has gone on, we felt it was important to do
something specific for the voters, not for political junkies or
anything else, but just for voters, you know, what the issues are,
what these people would do, so they had a clear idea of who they
were and what they stood for and what their vote really meant.''
   These were shows not just for the voters, but by the voters, who
asked their own questions of the candidates via videotape. They
wanted to know what Bush would do about the deficit and day-care,
what Dukakis would do to combat terrorism and what job would Jesse
Jackson have in his administration.
   Television has been accused of accentuating style over substance
in its campaign coverage. But the ``Today'' shows were a lesson in
how television can stick to its style and still offer substance.
   There was plenty for political junkies on the ``Today'' shows,
and who's kidding? It's more fun to hear pundits poke fun at
campaign ads than to listen to theories about the deficit.
   For the interviews, Dukakis was in New York. Bush was in a hotel
room in Columbus, Ohio. Typically, the candidates were mostly vague
with their answers, but not for Gumbel's lack of trying.
   Gumbel asked tough follow-ups and couched most questions in the
accessible, ``I am a voter interested in X, why should I vote for
you?''
   Bush said he would reduce the deficit by cutting spending. ``If
you won't tell me what you'll cut, why should I vote for you?''
Gumbel insisted.
   Gumbel asked Dukakis, ``If I sit there and don't think you have
managed your campaign competently, why should I vote for you?''
Dukakis said that being a good president is more than coming up with
good campaign ads. ``But it goes beyond ads,'' Gumbel insisted.
Dukakis was left speechless for a beat.
   But within the comfy confines of the top-rated morning show with
an audience mostly in houseshoes and breakfast nooks, the toughest
question for Dukakis came from a woman in Atlanta: ``My first
question would be, `Is he going to stop Kitty from smoking?'''
   Dukakis grinned sheepishly and shook his head. No campaign
promises here.
   ``I've been trying for a long time,'' he said. ``Somebody asked
me the other day whether or not I was going to have a smoke-free
White House, and I said, not and maintain the kind of domestic
tranquility I've had with my wife for 25 years.''

<TEXT>
   In a major victory for the Reagan
administration, a federal judge ruled Friday that a conservation
organization was not entitled to challenge the removal of use
restrictions on federal land in the West.
   U.S. District Judge John Pratt decided that the National Wildlife
Federation had not shown enough injury to members to give it
standing to sue.
   The Bureau of Land Management, an arm of the Interior Department,
in 1981 began revoking restrictions _ called ``classifications'' or
``withdrawals'' _ that govern almost all the 174 million acres it
administers in the 17 westernmost states of the lower 48.
   Classifications and withdrawals generally amount to the same
thing. They can ban a single activity on a federal parcel, such as
mining; may keep the the parcel in question from being sold or
exchanged; or may impose several restrictions at once.
   The federation filed suit in 1985, alleging among other things
that the department was violating federal law by proceeding without
recommendations to Congress and the president, without preparation
of plans to guide its actions and without public involvement.
   Its members' recreational use of the land would be ``irreparably
injured'' if the government were allowed to proceed, the federation
said.
   Pratt subsequently granted an injunction that froze all
restrictions pending further consideration of the case. On Friday,
he dissolved that injunction and dismissed the case.
   ``We are ecstatic,'' said Bob Johnson, a spokesman for the
bureau. He said officials would immediately began a review of
decisions held up by the injunction.
   Norman Dean, the federation's staff lawyer handling the case,
said he had not seen the decision and could not comment on details.
He added, ``This is not the end of it. It's back to the Court of
Appeals for us.''
   The lifting of the injunction means the government is free to
sell or trade whatever parcels have no restrictions on them, and
miners may stake claims on millions of acres, Dean said.
   In December 1987, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia upheld the injunction against an attempt to
dissolve it by the Mountain States Legal Foundation, a
conservatively oriented advocacy group based in Denver, and the
department.
   In so doing, the appeals court ruled that the federation, on
behalf of its members, was entitled to seek the injunction. The
federation need not be as specific in its allegations at such a
preliminary stage as an injunction as it might have to be when a
judge reached the underlying merits of the case, the appeals judges
said.
   To prevail on the merits, the federation must ``allege facts
showing that one or more of its members is among the persons injured
by the challenged agency action.''
   According to Pratt's ruling, the federation faied to make such a
showing.
   Affidavits aimed at establishing standing of the federation to
sue _ submitted by members Peggy Peterson and Roger Erman, whose
hometowns were not given _ were ``vague, conclusory and lacked
factual specificity,'' Pratt wrote.
   ``They do not and cannot show injury in fact with respect to the
two specific areas in Wyoming and Arizona in the vicinity of which
these affiants claim to be located.
   ``More important, standing alone, these two affidavits do not
provide any basis for standing to challenge as violative of (the
law) the legality of each of the 1,250 or so classification
terminations and withdrawal revocations.''
   The Peterson affidavit covered land in the Green River area of
Wyoming and the Erman affidavit concerned land near Grand Canyon.
   For example, ``There is no showing that Peterson's recreational
use and enjoyment extends to the particular 4,500 acres covered by
the decision to terminate classification and to the remainder of the
2 million acres affected by the determination. All she alleges is,
she uses lands `in the vicinity.' The affidavit on its face contains
only a bare allegation of injury.''

<HEAD>Miami Paper Files Amendment To Extend Joint Operating Agreement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A joint operating agreement between The Miami
News and The Miami Herald would be extended from 1996 until Dec. 31,
2021 under an amendment to the agreement released Friday by the
Justice Department.
   Under the amendment filed Thursday with the government, Cox
Enterprises Inc., which owns The News, would continue to share in
the operating income of The Herald until the year 2021.
   The sharing of net annual operating income would continue if The
News is sold or stops publication, Cox chairman James Kennedy said
in a letter to the Justice Department outlining the amendment.
   The amendment filed with the Justice Department also would
require Cox to absorb all losses of The News beginning in 1990; and
reduce Cox's share of the Herald's income beginning in 1989.
   After the first $7.5 million in net annual operating income,
which goes to The Herald, Cox in 1989 would receive 14 percent of
the income; 13 percent in 1990; 12 percent in 1991; 11 percent in
1992; and 10 percent from 1993 to 2021.
   Kennedy's letter said The News has sustained losses of more than
$90 million since the JOA was instituted in 1966 with The Herald,
owned by Knight-Ridder Inc.
   It was announced Oct. 14 that The News would close Dec. 31 if no
buyer is found. Company officials cited declining circulation _
which now stands at less than 48,000 _ and continuing financial
losses at the 92-year-old daily.
   In announcing the decision to sell or close The News, Cox
officials had said a continued JOA would not be a part of the deal.
   Cox Enterprises has fielded more than 30 inquiries from
prospective buyers, and meetings with several of them are scheduled
within the next few days for fact-gathering by both sides.
   The News' production, advertising, circulation and promotion
departments are owned by The Miami Herald Publishing Co.

<HEAD>Special Commission Clears Former Oil Chief Of Corruption</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A special congressional commission cleared
former government oil chief Mario Ramon Beteta on Friday of union
allegations that he embezzled about $49 million.
   The Mexico City daily Excelsior said the commission split along
party lines.
   It said the 15 commission members who voted for Beteta's
exoneration belong to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party.
Beteta also is a PRI member.
   Of seven commissioners who voted against exoneration, six belong
to opposition parties and the seventh was PRI member Adolfo
Barrientos, head of the oil union that was at odds with Beteta when
he was chief of the government oil monopoly Pemex, the paper said.
   Beteta left Pemex in January to become governor of Mexico state,
which borders Mexico City.
   Barrientos presented the allegations against Beteta on Sept. 27,
hours after Beteta and other political leaders met with
President-elect Carlos Salinas de Gortari and endorsed Salinas' call
for modernizing the PRI.
   Such modernization could include probes into union corruption and
has been opposed by some of PRI's key labor sectors.
   Oilworkers crowded into Chamber of Deputies galleries to cheer
Barrientos when he accused Beteta of defrauding Pemex through a 1985
leasing deal for two Yugoslav-built tankers.
   But the special commission ruled Friday that ``no illicit conduct
existed.''
   The Federal Comptroller's Office cleared Beteta of any wrongdoing
in the deal in a published report it released Thursday, the
government newspaper El Nacional said.
   Beteta became Pemex chief in December 1982 as part of President
Miguel de la Madrid's anti-corruption campaign. He replaced Jorge
Diaz Serrano, who was convicted for embezzling $58.7 million in a
1980 tanker deal.

   The young sisters of a newborn abducted from
their mother's arms by a woman posing a nurse want to know where
their brother is and don't understand why he is missing, their
father said Friday.
   More than $16,000 in reward money has been posted for information
leading to the return of Christopher Michael Jones, who was abducted
Tuesday night from Doctors Hospital.
   Willie Jones, the baby's father, said he has told his daughters,
Janelle, 5, and Crystal, 8, that ``the baby was kidnapped and we
believe that Christopher will be returned.''
   ``They want to know why she did it and when will he be back,'' he
said.
   The boy's mother, Annette Thomas-Jones, answered questions Friday
with her husband at her side in a hospital interview with The
Associated Press. She credited her equanimity to her faith in God.
   ``We have a serious belief that Christopher will be O.K.,'' said
Mrs. Thomas-Jones, 32. ``I just trust in him. He's going to bring
Christopher home to us.''
   Mrs. Thomas-Jones said the woman, dressed in a white skirt and a
white sweater, came to her room about 10 p.m. Tuesday and asked to
weigh the baby. She said the woman asked the baby's name and said
she needed to take the blanket and the pacifier with her.
   The woman also said she heard some nurses coming and looked out
into the hallway to make sure no one was there, Mrs. Thomas-Jones
said.
   After the woman left, a real nurse came and was told the baby
already had been taken to the nursery, Mrs. Thomas-Jones said. A
short time later, four hospital administrators told her the baby was
gone.
   ``The lady's going to have a conscience,'' she said of the woman.
``The Lord's going to give her a conscience and that's going to be
the start to his coming home to us.''
   Her husband said that he believed the baby was just lost in the
hospital when he was first told of the child's disappearance.
   ``You go from being ecstatic about the birth of your first son to
being shocked because your son has been kidnapped,'' he said.
   The couple said they were not angry at the woman or the hospital,
but Jones said he was glad hospital officials planned to re-evaluate
their security procedures.
   ``I don't hate this woman. I feel sorry for her,'' Mrs.
Thomas-Jones said.
   All leads in the case have dead-ended, said Officer Jason Shook
of the Little Rock Police Department.
   Dr. Whit Hall of Doctors Hospital said Christopher, who was born
six weeks' premature and weighing only four pounds, could die if not
given proper treatment.
   Police have released a composite sketch of the kidnapper,
described by Mrs. Thomas-Jones as black, 135 pounds, 5-foot-4, with
shoulder-length black hair.

<HEAD>Latvia Joins Estonia in Opposing Gorbachev's Constitutional Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nationalist groups in Estonia and Latvia on Friday
denounced President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's plan for reforming the
Soviet government. Human rights activist Andrei Sakharov called for
guarantees of human rights.
   In Estonia, the ruling Presidium called a special session of the
legislature for next week to consider complaints that the reform
would weaken the self-administration of the 14 non-Russian
republics, according to an editor at the newspaper Sovietskaya
Estonia.
   The Estonia Peoples' Front declared that the reform, which would
create a new national parliament and a powerful presidency, leaves
the republics ``with fewer rights than a province of Czarist
Russia,'' Sovietskaya Estonia said.
   The Estonia People's Front is a political organization created
last spring in an effort to oppose domination of the Baltic republic
by the Kremlin. It claims to have 60,000 members.
   Complaints in Latvia also centered on the loss of local control,
said Janis Dinevich, a leader of the Latvia People's Front in a
telephone interview from Riga.
   The constitutional reform is a key part of Gorbachev's attempt to
drive out members of the old guard and replace them with supporters
of perestroika, his plan for economic restructuring, and glasnost,
greater openness in some areas.
   But the reform is drawing strong opposition from some republics.
   Under the present constitution the 15 republics have their own
constitutions, governments and self-administration not expressly
reserved to the central government.
   Sakharov, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975, said the revised
constitution should provide clear guarantees of human rights.
   ``Society needs dissidents,'' Sakharov said in an article in
Friday's edition of New Times magazine. He also suggested greater
public involvement in overseeing the government.
   ``For example, without the sympathy of the people, we could not
have made decisions like sending troops into Afghanistan,'' Sakharov
wrote.
   He had condemned the Soviet decision to send troops into
Afghanistan in 1979 and that criticism was one reason he was forced
to live in internal exile in the closed city of Gorki for several
years.
   Sovietskaya Estonia said in editions earlier this week that the
Estonia Peoples' Front sent a telegram to Gorbachev saying the
reform drafts ``are a step backward in the development of electoral
democracy,''
   ``Their adoption undoubtedly will lead to unforeseen consequences
for the strengthening of the unity of the U.S.S.R. and the
democratic development of perestroika in our country,'' the telegram
said, according to the report.
   The newspaper said the front called for removing the reform
propoosal from the agenda of the Nov. 29 session of the national
Supreme Soviet, or parliament, which was called to pass the
amendments.
   The duty editor at the paper said the Estonian Presidium on
Friday called for a special session of the republic's legislature
for Nov. 16 to consider the reform plan.
   The editor said Estonian Prime Minister Bruno Saul offered his
resignation Friday. It was not known if any action was taken. Some
Estonians have accused Saul of being pro-Moscow.
   An Estonian journalist, speaking on the condition he not be
identified, said Estonians and Latvians fear the reform would shift
control over the republics' economies and many other critical areas
to the central government.
   He also said under the reform the number of seats the Russian
republic would have in the national parliament would increase from
32 percent to 43 percent.
   The representative of the Latvia Peoples' Front said the reform
issues are too complex for only a month's consideration and the
front wants discussions of the plan in the republics' legislatures
and then a national constitutional convention.

   The editor of The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta
Constitution resigned Friday, citing a lack of ``shared values and
mutual trust'' with the newspapers' senior management.
   Bill Kovach, who left the top post at the Washington bureau of
The New York Times to take over the papers in December 1986, was
welcomed enthusiastically then as he set a goal of making the
Journal and Constitution _ essentially one newspaper, with different
editorial pages _ into ``world-class journalism.''
   The news of his resignation came suddenly, in a brief story at
the bottom of Page One in late editions of the afternoon Journal.
   Publisher Jay Smith said ``an irreconcilable difference in
management styles surfaced in a discussion Friday morning,''
according to the story. Smith said that while he and Kovach were
``in accord philosophically over the direction the newspapers have
taken,'' the management difference caused him to accept the editor's
resignation.
   Kovach, in a statement, said his resignation brought to an end
``two years of effort to develop a set of shared values and mutual
trust with the senior managers of the company. ... It became clear
this week that no such relationship existed.''
   Exactly what precipitated Friday morning's developments was not
clear. Neither the Journal's story nor Kovach's statement went into
detail about the discussion, and representatives of Smith and Kovach
said the men would not discuss the matter with reporters.
   Likewise, there was no word on Kovach's plans, or replacement.
   The resignation was announced to the Journal-Constitution
newsroom by Assistant Managing Editor Wendell ``Sonny'' Rawls, who
followed Kovach from the Times. The news stunned the staff.
   A petition, signed by 119 staffers in the five hours it was
posted in the newsroom, urged Smith and other senior newspaper
executives to reconsider their acceptance of Kovach's resignation
and persuade him to stay.
   ``Many of us have worked here under previous management (led by
former editor James G. Minter) and perhaps we have an even greater
appreciation for his (Kovach's) ability, his sound news judgment and
his enthusiasm,'' the petition said.
   Minter, who became a senior editor when Kovach was hired, retired
earlier this year.
   In addition to the petition, a group of Atlanta newspaper
employees purchased a full-page advertisement in Saturday's combined
editions to protest Kovach's resignation.
   His appointment had been seen in journalism as a sign that Cox
Enterprises Inc. wanted more from its flagship newspaper, which some
felt had been coasting for almost two decades on the reputation of
Ralph McGill, the editor of the morning Constitution whose civil
rights crusades won a Pulitzer Prize in 1959.
   Kovach stressed hard news and aggressiveness. Among the successes
under his leadership was a series outlining how some Atlanta banks
were refusing loans to residents of predominantly black
neighborhoods.
   The Journal-Constitution had five Pulitzer finalists in Kovach's
first year, more than any other newspaper in the country.

<HEAD>Woman Pleads Guilty To Murder In Love Triangle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JUNCTION CITY, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former church secretary has pleaded
guilty to murder charges in the 1983 slaying of her husband and
admitted that she gave her former minister the handgun used to kill
him.
   The alleged love triangle formed the basis of a television
miniseries.
   Lorna Anderson Eldridge, 35, entered the plea to second-degree
murder Thursday, telling the court that she and Thomas Bird plotted
the 1983 slaying of Martin K. Anderson.
   Mrs. Eldridge said she and Bird hatched a plot in which she
stopped her van on a rural highway and pretended to lose her keys so
that her husband had to get out and look for them. The Lutheran
pastor then shot her husband, she said.
   The slaying and Mrs. Eldridge's reputed love affair with Bird
were dramatized in the CBS miniseries ``Murder Ordained'' in 1987.
   Mrs. Eldridge and Bird, 38, already are serving prison terms. She
pleaded guilty in 1985 to criminal solicitation in an earlier,
unsuccessful plot on her husband's life and was sentenced to five to
18 years.
   Bird, who has not been charged in Anderson's death, was convicted
in 1984 of criminal solicitation in the unsuccessful plot. He was
sentenced to two-and-a-half to seven years in that case, and to life
in prison for murdering his wife, Sandra, in 1983.
   Sheriff Bill Deppish said Mrs. Eldridge's statement was an
``important breakthrough'' that could lead to new charges against
Bird.
   Mrs. Eldridge, who remarried, originally was charged with
first-degree murder but accepted a plea bargain under which the
prosecution will seek a 10-year prison term at sentencing Jan. 3.
   Second-degree murder carries a maximum penalty of 20 years to
life in prison.
   Jack Focht, Mrs. Eldridge's attorney, called the case ``kind of
the great American tragedy _ that people romantically come apart
sometimes and get involved romantically and violence sometimes
happens.
   ``And when it happens as it did on Nov. 4, 1983, lives get
stamped indelibly, lots of lives,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   About 100 people gathered at Santiago's
general cemetery Friday for the burial of a 30-year-old leftist who
officials said drowned while fleeing police.
   At the end of the ceremony a few shots were fired into the air in
a salute to Raul Pellegrin, whose casket was draped with guerrilla
banners including the red and black flag of the Manuel Roderiguez
Patriotic Front.
   Police said Pellegrin belonged to the Front, Chile's main
guerrilla organization which is linked to the banned Communist Party.
   Police officers were stationed around the cemetery near downtown
Santiago but not near the site of the service. They did not
intervene. The crowd dispersed without incident.
   Pellegrin's body was found in a river near a rural police station
that underwent a machine-gun attack and was burned by guerrillas two
weeks ago. The station's duty officer was killed.
   Police said Pellegrin led that assault in Los Quenes, 140 miles
south of Santiago, and drowned while fleeing police. They said the
body of a woman, Cecelia Magni, also was found in the river and that
she also had participated in the attack.
   Relatives and human rights activists called for an investigation
into the deaths, disputing police reports that the two drowned
accidentally.

<HEAD>Stations Won't Run Anti-Measure 8 Ads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four local television stations have refused
to broadcast a political commercial that shows a boy being placed in
the foster care of two homosexual men.
   The commercial was produced by supporters of Ballot Measure 8,
which would repeal Gov. Neil Goldschmidt's 1987 executive order
prohibiting discrimination by state executive agencies on the basis
of sexual orientation.
   ``The spot is extremely inflammatory and distasteful,'' said
Steve Currie, manager of broadcast operations at KOIN.
   The commercial also was rejected by KATU, KGW and KPTV.
   A chief sponsor of the initiative, Mike Wiley, called the
rejection of the advertisement ``out-and-out censorship.''
   Measure 8 needs a simple majority to pass. A statewide poll
released Friday of 400 registered voters commissioned by The
Oregonian in Portland and KOIN showed 50 percent were against the
ballot initiative and 44 percent in favor. The poll, conducted by
Griggs-Anderson Research of Portland from Oct. 28 to Nov. 1, has a
4.9 percent margin of error.
   The 30-second commercial shows a young boy with a social worker
who says, ``Well, Ryan, shall we meet your new parents?''
   The camera briefly shows two men sitting on a bench together, and
the spot ends with the boy asking, ``But where is my mommy?''
   ``The governor's order removes any discretion state agencies have
in refusing to place foster children with homosexuals,'' a voice in
the ad says.
   Goldschmidt has said his order has been distorted from its
original intent and that it doesn't give special treatment to anyone.
   Station officials saying they did not believe the executive order
had a direct bearing on the state's foster-parent program. Nothing
in the language of the order deals with foster care.
   ``The spot implies that if Measure 8 were to pass, gays would no
longer be able to be foster parents in the state, and that's not the
case,'' said Elizabeth Fetsch, operations manager for KGW.
   Station executives said they were generally required to
broadcast, without editing, political spots from qualified
candidates, but they said they had a greater obligation to review
ballot measure advertising for inaccuracies.
   Skip Hinman, general manager of KATU, said attorneys for his
station began looking into the accuracy of the advertisement because
``we just looked at it as a very inflammatory piece.''
   Wiley said the commercial was running on some stations in
southern Oregon.
   Officials at Portland's other TV station, KPDX, said they had not
been asked to run the ad.

<TEXT>
   A state law limiting people to 10 minutes
in the voting booth was struck down Friday by a federal judge, who
citied a long and complex ballot.
   ``A fundamental constitutional right is being denied to a large
part of the California voting population ... and the 10-minute limit
is unreasonable given the size and the complexity of today's
ballot,'' said U.S. District Court Judge Robert P. Aguilar.
   Civil rights activists won the temporary restraining order after
three counties announced that, due to usually lengthy ballots, they
would attempt to enforce some measure of the 67-year-old law for the
first time in memory.
   The Mexican American Legal Defense Fund, the Northern California
Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union and the Legal Aid
Society of Santa Clara argued that the time limit violated the
federal Voting Rights Act.
   They said it effectively discourages people with languages from
voting.
   Aguilar agreed, saying the time limit served as a virtual
literacy proficiency test, which is specifically outlawed by the act.

   Britain on Friday criticized
Czechoslovakia for using police to break up a banned rally in Prague
a week ago and for its treatment of two activists.
   Peter Summerscale, deputy head of the British delegation, told
the 35-nation conference on European security and cooperation that
the police action contradicted ``the purposes which guide the work
of this conference.''
   Hundreds of helmeted riot police used tear gas, water cannon,
batons and dogs to scatter a peaceful crowd of 5,000 on the 70th
anniversary of Czechoslovak independence on Oct. 28.
   ``The fact is that the police brutally dispersed ... peaceful
citizens,'' Summerscale said in his address. ``Why, I must ask, was
force deemed necessary? Why also were 87 people arrested?''
   He also singled out the cases of Ivan Polansky, a Czechoslovak
activist who published underground literature, and Augustin
Navratil, who organized a petition that collected 500,000 signatures
for religious freedom this year.
   A district court in Slovakia sentenced Polansky in June to four
years in jail for subversive activity against the Czechoslovak
republic. The supreme court in Bratislava upheld the sentence in
August.
   ``What books could have been so horrifying, so dangerous as to
merit the attentions of the Czechoslovak authorities in this way?,''
Summerscale asked in his speech.
   Navratil, a Roman Catholic activist, was removed from his home in
central Czechoslovakia on Oct. 28 by two policemen and two doctors
and taken to a nearby psychiatric clinic where he previously had
been ordered to report.
   Navratil was confined ``no matter that his wife, a psychiatric
nurse until her retirement, believes him to pe perfectly sane and .
.. that a Swiss psychiatrist ... did not find him mentaly ill,''
Summerscale said.
   The conference nations reviewing compliance with the 1975
Helsinki Act are the United States, the Soviet Union, Canada and all
European nations except Albania.
   The conference opened in November 1986 to discuss security,
economic and cultural cooperation and human rights in Europe.
   Broad agreement has been reached on a mandate for new East-West
talks on reducing conventional arms. But disagreement persists over
human rights, particularly over political prisoners in the Soviet
Union and a Kremlin proposal to hold a conference on human rights in
Moscow in 1991.

   A Soviet official said Friday his
government very much wants to meet the Feb. 15 target for withdrawal
of all Soviet troops from Afghanistan.
   The official, who spoke on condition he not be identified, was
asked about the Soviet announcement earlier Friday that the
withdrawal had been suspended.
   Alexander Bessmertnykh, first deputy foreign minister, told
reporters in Moscow the reason for the suspension was that
anti-communist rebels continued to attack civilians, government
troops and withdrawing Soviet forces. He also accused America and
Pakistan of keeping up a constant flow of weapons to the rebels.
   Burhanuddin Rabbani, a rebel leader who was in New York for the
annual U.N. meeting on Afghanistan, said:
   ``We believe that the new threat by the Russians that they will
postpone the withdrawal of their troops is only an excuse. The
Russians knew from the beginning that with the withdrawal of their
troops the puppet regime (of Afghan President Najib) would fall
down, so it is not something new.''
   Rabbani is chairman of the seven-party Islamic Unity of Afghan
Mujahedeen alliance. He was interviewed in a New York City hotel
room.
   ``The Mujahedeen (holy warriors) have announced that if the
Russians do not bombard the villages on their withdrawal, the
Mujahedeen will not create any obstacle for their troops,'' he said.
``As a matter of fact, the Mujahedeen gave permission to the
Russians to leave certain areas in security.''
   He was asked about the Soviets moving MiG-27 ground-attack jets
and SS-1 Scud missiles into Afganiistan. He said such actions ``are
all indications that the Russians are continuing their dangerous war
policy in Afghanistan, which is not only a threat to Afghanistan but
to the region as a whole, and they want to find an excuse for their
war policy.''
   The Soviet official in New York, commenting on the new Soviet
arms shipments, said the Kremlin was sending more powerful weapons
to Afghanistan because Soviet troops and civilians were being
attacked by Afghan rebels, some using U.S.-made Stinger rockets.
   ``Now, unfortunately our troops are attacked and also the
peaceful population of Afghan cities is also attacked and so we have
to do something specific in this military field,'' he said.
   ``The Stinger attacks against our troops required some reaction
from our side.''
   He said the Soviet Union was taking strong measures in hopes of
improving the situation so all of its troops would be out of
Afghanistan by Feb. 15. That is the date stipulated in the
U.N.-sponsored acords signed in April in Geneva by Afghanistan,
Pakistan, the Soviet Union and United States. The Afghan rebels were
not included in the negotiations.
   The Soviet Union sent troops into Afghanistan in December 1979 to
help the Marxist government battle the guerrillas.
   Moscow had an estimated 115,000 military personnel in Afganistan
and began the withdrawal May 15. The Soviets reported half of the
force had been removed by Aug. 15.
   The official did not define what the Soviets meant by the word
``suspended.''
   He said the first phase of withdrawal was completed by Aug. 15
and the ``second phase has not started, but that does not mean we
are not aiming for the date of Feb. 15.''

   Archbishop Desmond Tutu said Friday that
black South Africans would be disappointed by a Republican victory
in next week's presidential election.
   ``We would rather see a Democrat in the White House than a
Republican,'' Tutu said. ``We have suffered a great deal from the
Reagan administration's policy of constructive engagement.''
   Tutu, leader of the Anglican Church in southern Africa and winner
of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, made the comments in Nairobi while
attending the annual conference of the All-Africa Council of
Churches.
   He is council president and chairman.
   Tutu did not mention either Democrat Michael Dukakis or
Republican George Bush by name. He also did not single out policies
advocated by either candidate that would be harmful or helpful to
blacks in South Africa.
   The Reagan administration preferred a policy on South Africa that
became known as constructive engagement _ dialogue with the
white-led Pretoria government rather than the diplomatic and
economic confrontational tactics pursued by former Democratic
President Jimmy Carter.
   Tutu said President Reagan's policy had failed.
   ``We are now virtually being ruled by martial law,'' he said.
   The archbishop said South African authorities had declared a
state of emergency three times during Reagan's tenure at the White
House. During that period, he said, more than 2,000 people were
killed, many by security forces.
   Tutu is a key activist against apartheid, the policy of racial
segregation under which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no
vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy
and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   Unidentified gunmen on Friday opened fire
on a procession led by the mother of Pakistan's populist opposition
leader Benazir Bhutto, but she was unhurt.
   Begum Nusrat Bhutto, who shares the leadership of the Pakistan
People's Party with her daughter, was en route to the airport in the
central city of Multan when the shooting began.
   Twenty-five people were injured when people began throwing
stones, Ms. Bhutto told a news conference when she arrived in Lahore.
   No one claimed responsibility, but she accused the opposition.
   Benazir Bhutto, contacted at her Larkana home in the southern
province of Sind, echoed her mother's accusation that the shooting
was ordered by a candidate of the opposition Pakistan Muslim League.
   ``We are not afraid of these sort of attacks on our life,'' said
Ms. Bhutto. ``We will continue with our struggle. Begum Bhutto is
like a mother of the people of Pakistan.''
   Bhutto's party and the Muslim League are thought to be the
leading contenders for power in the Nov. 16 general elections.
   President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq called the elections shortly before
his death in an airplane crash Aug. 17.
   Zia came to power in 1977 after overthrowing Begum Bhutto's
husband, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in a bloodless coup. Bhutto was
executed in 1979 for plotting to kill a political enemy.

   A performing killer whale at Sea World of
Florida gave birth Friday to her second calf, a 6{-foot-long female
weighing about 350 pounds.
   ``It was a picture-perfect birthing process, and mother and baby
are doing just fine,'' said Jack Pearson, curator of mammals at the
Orlando marine park.
   The birth was the third at Sea World parks by performing killer
whales.
   The mother, named Kandu, also had given birth to Baby Shamu,
which was born September 1985 and is now one of the park's top
performers. A third calf was born last month at a Sea World park in
San Diego.
   Another of the giant mammals at the Orlando park is pregnant and
expected to give birth soon.
   Pearson said Kandu began bonding with her offspring immediately
after the birth in a special 6-million-gallon breeding tank.
   The whale was in labor for a little more than three hours. The
newborn, which has not been named, was expected to begin nursing
several hours after birth.
   Kandu continued to perform before crowds at the park's marine
stadium until Thursday, when trainers noticed some behavioral and
body changes.
   ``She was very slow and didn't eat all her food. She did not
perform but spent a quiet night. This morning, she refused to eat,
which is a tell-tale sign that birth is imminent,'' Pearson said.

   Indian navy ships Friday night
surrounded a boat filled with foreign mercenaries who seized
hostages and fled the Maldives after trying to overthrow its
government, according to reports from the archipelago.
   A doctor and a pharmacist contacted by telephone in Male, the
capital, said Maldives television reported the Indians were trying
to negotiate on the high seas for the hostages' release.
   The mercenaries, thought to be Tamils from nearby Sri Lanka, fled
early Friday after Indian paratroopers landed to help President
Maumoon Abdul Gayoom and his lightly armed security forces.
   About 20 hostages, including a Cabinet minister and his family,
were hustled aboard the 5,000-ton boat when gunmen fled through
blasts of Indian machine-gun fire, said a senior Indian air force
officer.
   The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity after returning
from Male, said an unknown number of mercenaries and their
sympathizers also were on the boat.
   In Singapore, former President Ibrahim Nasir of the Maldives
strongly denied any involvement in the coup attempt and threatened
to take legal action against anyone who implicated him directly or
indirectly, the Straits Times reported Saturday. Several Western
diplomats in Colombo said earlier they suspected Nasir, Gayoom's
predecessor, of involvement.
   The attempted coup began shortly before dawn Thursday when gunmen
attacked the presidential palace in Male. Gayoom appealed to India,
the biggest military power in the region, for help.
   India's state-run television Friday showed bullet-pocked
government buildings in Male, including the headquarters of the
1,200-man Maldivian security forces.
   Gayoom was shown smiling and looking fit. He said he requested
India military assistance ``in order to minimize casualties among
the civilians.''
   Ahmed Abdullah Aziz, Maldivian high commissioner in Colombo, said
12 people were killed during the attack. But Baldev Kapoor, a
photographer for the Sygma agency, quoted Foreign Minister Fathulla
Jameel as saying 30 people died.
   Kapoor was one of several Indian journalists taken with Indian
troops to Male. He quoted Kapoor as saying the deaths included
civilians.
   The foreign minister said Indian and Maldivian troops conducted
house-to-house searches and combed dozens of atolls in Indian Ocean
nation of coral islands and islets.
   Radio Male said five mercenaries were arrested.
   Several foreign diplomats in Sri Lanka, about 500 miles northeast
of the Maldives, said the invaders numbered no more than 150.
   Radio Male said about 700 Indian paratroopers were sent in.
Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi did not say how many there were,
but he said they would be withdrawn soon.
   The identity of the abducted Cabinet minister was not known.
   The Indian air force officer said he did not know the man's name.
   Several Male residents said Transport Minister Ahmed Mujithaba
was abducted.
   The Kuwaiti news agency KUNA quoted Sheik Mohammed Rashid, an
adviser to Gayoom, as identifying the abducted official as
Communications Minister Mujtabi Hussein.
   Gayoom, who has survived three coup attempts since he was elected
president in 1978, said an investigation was under way to determine
who was behind the latest attack.
   In Sri Lanka, a spokesman for the biggest Tamil militant group,
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, denied involvement. Tamils, a
minority in Sri Lanka, have been waging a war there for an
independent nation.
   The Straits Times quoted Nasir as saying in a statement through
his lawyer, ``I categorically deny and reject any suggestion that I
was at any time or in any way involved in the reported coup
attempt.''
   Nasir and his family have lived in Singapore since December 1978.
He was quoted as saying he no longer retained any interest in the
Maldives, nor did he have any dealings with any party in Sri Lanka.
   Most of the gunmen who landed in Male spoke Tamil, according to
residents and officials.
   The Maldives, with a population of 182,000, were ruled by a
hereditary sultan until 1968. The proclamation that declared a
republic in 1968 also proclaimed Nasir president.
   He became increasingly authoritarian, and in 1975 he fired his
prime minister, who was placed in detention with 25 associates.
   Under Gayoom, the Maldives have sought a course of non-alignment.
When he was transport minister under Nasir, Gayoom led opposition to
Soviet attempts to lease a former British military base in the
Maldives.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis is pulling
slightly ahead of Republican George Bush in Rhode Island, but his
lead is not yet statistically significant, a new poll of
presidential candidates preferred by likely voters indicates.
   The latest poll, released Friday by WPRI-TV, showed Dukakis
leading 48 percent to Bush's 42 percent, statistically too close to
call with a five percentage point margin of error.
   The Massachusetts governor, who had maintained a steady lead in
neighboring Rhode Island in late summer, first fell back late last
month when two successive polls by WPRI showed Dukakis and Bush
nearly even.
   The latest poll was conducted Wednesday and Thursday by Joseph T.
Fleming & Associates and involved a telephone survey of 411 likely
voters.

   Four days of riots touched off by the
killings of 14 fishermen by Venezuelan troops last week claimed
their first death, an 18- year-old laborer struck by a
demonstrator's rock, press reports said Friday.
   The victim, Javier Antonio Belloso of Maracaibo, 250 miles west
of Caracas, was riding in a public bus Thursday when demonstrators
began throwing rocks, according to El Universal, a Caracas
newspaper. One rock hit Belloso in the head and he died shortly
after, the paper said.
   The riots followed the shooting by Venezuelan border troops last
Saturday of 14 fishermen the military claimed were Colombian
guerrillas.
   Students at major universities in Caracas and elsewhere went on a
rampage, sacking stors and banks, burning vehicles, blocking traffic
and battling police and National Guard units.
   At least 50 students and seven police have been injured,
according to student groups and press reports. No official figures
have been released.
   On Friday the protesters scaled down their demonstrations, but
promised to keep protesting in the face of what they called a
government effort to cover up a massacre and protect the killers.
   President Jaime Lusinchi met Friday with relatives of the 14
fishermen and promised they would receive justice.
   In a press briefing, Lusinchi vowed that a military investigation
would get to the truth about the incident near El Amparo, 360 miles
southwest of Caracas.
   ``This grave incident will be investigated with all seriousness
... you can be confident that justice will be done, that
responsibilities will be handed out and the story will be told as it
happened,'' Lusinchi said.
   Relatives of the fishermen have said the men were not involved
with guerrillas and instead were militants of the governing party,
Accion Democratica, out on a picnic when they were ambushed.
   Appearing at the news conference along with Lusinchi, the
commander of the army brigade involved denied innocent civilians had
been massacred, insisting the army had proof of links with Colombian
guerrillas.
   ``Many, many of them had antecedents not only in Venezuela, but
in Colombia,'' Gen. Humberto Camejo Arias said.
   Camejo said army troops had found on the men maps of oil
installations, a list of cattle ranchers in the area, and six or
seven rifles, including a West German-made G-3 rifle used by the
Colombian military.
   Colombian officials have denied the men were guerrillas.

<TEXT>
   Officials of the European Economic
Community and the Soviet Union held two days of ``very
constructive'' talks on a possible trade and cooperation agreement,
an EEC spokeswoman said Friday.
   The discussions marked the first exploratory contacts between the
12-nation trading bloc and a Soviet delegation led by Ivan Ivanov,
vice president of the Soviet state commission for foreign economic
relations.
   The spokeswoman, who demanded anonymity, said further talks would
be held but no time or place had been set.
   A statement from the trading bloc said the Soviets described
economic reforms under way or planned in the communist nation. In
particular, it said, the officials ``underlined the important role
that foreign commerce should play in the Soviet economy in the
future.''
   The EEC expressed the need for better facilities for business
people working in the Soviet Union, such as help in finding office
space and local staff, the spokeswoman said.
   In previous contacts, the Soviets indicated they would be
interested in a cooperation agreement with the European countries
covering a wide variety of areas, including high technology. The
transfer of such sensitive technology to Moscow is tightly
controlled.
   Before the talks, Willy De Clercq, the community's top trade
official, said an eventual agreement with Moscow could cover
cooperation in such areas as the environment, energy, transportation
and exchange of information and statistics.
   The community, also known as the Common Market, signed in June a
declaration establishing official relations with the Soviet-led
socialist economic bloc, called the Council for Mutual Economic
Assistance.
   Moscow's partners in Comecon are East Germany, Poland,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania, plus Vietnam, Cuba
and Mongolia.

   Leftist guerrillas attacked army
positions, the City Hall and civil defense headquarters in a village
northeast of San Salvador Friday, wounding three civilians, the
military reported.
   Also Friday, about 3,000 leftist trade unionists, politicians and
students marched through San Salvador and held a vigil in front of
the U.S. Embassy to protest the Reagan administration's policies in
Central America.
   The armed forces press office said the rebel attack on Villa
Victoria, 56 miles northeast of San Salvador, began at about 4 a.m.
and ended two hours later when army reinforcements arrived.
   It said a woman and two children were injured when their vehicle
was struck by shrapnel from anti-personnel mines left by the
guerrillas on the outskirts of Villa Victoria.
   Local radio broadcasts said five members of the civil defense
were kidnapped but a national police agent said he had no
information about any abductions.
   The group at the U.S. Embassy said the protest was aimed at
calling for the end of U.S. intervention in El Salvador. The United
States backs the government and military with $1.5 million daily for
its war against Marxist-led rebels.
   Protest organizers dubbed the march: ``Reagan Goes, The Fight
Continues For National Liberation.''
   The walled U.S. Embassy was surrounded by riot police wearing
bullet-proof vests and toting rifles and tear gas canisters.

   A man who blamed his wife for allowing
their 8-week-old son to starve to death was convicted of involuntary
manslaughter six weeks after his wife was convicted of the same
charge.
   It took a Manistee County Circuit Court jury about two hours
Thursday night to find Edward Giddings, 26, guilty in the death of
Raymond LeRoy Giddings in December 1986.
   Giddings was sent to the Manistee County Jail to await
sentencing, a date for which has not been set. His 23-year-old wife,
Mildred, remains in the Mecosta County Jail awaiting sentencing Dec.
5.
   Involuntary manslaughter is punishable by a maximum sentence of
15 years in prison.
   Doctors who testified at the trials said an autopsy ruled out
medical causes for the infant's death, and contended the child
simply wasn't fed.
   Edward Giddings' attorney, Gordon McLellan, argued that Giddings
did not know his son was starving and that his wife told him she was
feeding the child.
   ``It never dawned on me that she could starve my kid,'' Giddings
testified Thursday. ``She told me she knew what she was doing.''
   The couple has another son, who is living with grandparents in
Washington state.

   Share prices rebounded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
despite a decline early Saturday during half-day trading.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 32.01-point
loser the previous trading day, gained 93.50 points, or 0.33
percent, to close at 28,046.75.
   Dealers said the index recovered from its early 99.21-point loss
because of last-minute selective buying of large capital issues
including steels and real estate issues.
   ``Investors, especially institutional ones, are still strongly
interested in buying stocks with prospects for higher share
prices,'' said one dealer.
   The main economic barometer started lower following a 2.89-point
decline in the Dow Jones industrial average in New York. Dealers
also attributed the early Nikkei loss to a lower-than-expected U.S.
jobless rate.
   The U.S. Labor Department reported Friday that the October
unemployment rate stood at 5.3 percent, 0.1 percentage point lower
than September's 5.4 percent.
   ``But investors were expecting the rate to be somewhere around
5.5 percent,'' said a dealer with Daiwa Securities, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Volume on the first section stood at 750 million shares.
   The foreign exchange market is closed Saturdays.

   Zookeepers hoping for little gorillas
have brought big gorillas Colossus and Muke together, but so far it
seems that the primate couple is still in the dating phase.
   Colossus, at 6-foot-2 and some 570 pounds is said to be the
largest gorilla in captivity, but he's inexperienced in the gorilla
mating game. He hadn't seen another gorilla since infancy until he
was introduced to Muke.
   Muke (pronounced Moo-key) is one of the largest female gorillas
in captivity at 4-foot-8, and she knows how to throw her 274 pounds
around. She has a reputation for being ornery, said Pat Quinn,
director of The Zoo.
   ``He's exerting his male dominance, but she takes care of
herself,'' Quinn said Thursday. ``He gets a scratch or a snitch from
Muke everytime he gets hold of her. She's not too intimidated by
him.''
   Both gorillas are about 22, and began sharing the large gorilla
yard at The Zoo last month. Muke is on breeding loan from the St.
Louis Zoo.
   If the two don't mate, Colossus' keepers won't take it to heart.
The main purpose of Muke's visit is to socialize Colossus to gorilla
ways, said Quinn. If they appear unlikely to mate, a known breeding
female will be obtained, he said.
   It may just be a matter of time.
   It's a good sign, said Quinn, that Colossus herds Muke into her
separate sleeping quarters, and he pointed out both animals have
become slimmer and trimmer since meeting.
   ``They say when you're in love you lose weight,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis said Friday his underdog bid for
the White House is gaining steam in the campaign's final days and
accused rival George Bush of taking ``a furlough from the truth'' in
proclaiming support for average Americans.
   ``He's slipping and we're surging,'' the Democratic nominee told
a rally in New York before heading to Kentucky and to Illinois.
   In Chicago he joined four former rivals for his party's
nomination in the Democrats' traditional torchlight parade. Marching
with him were Illinois Sen. Paul Simon, Chicagoan Jesse Jackson,
Tennessee Sen. Al Gore Jr. and former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt.
   Also joining Dukakis was his wife, Kitty, who was hospitalized
earlier this week with a viral infection.
   Dukakis had been growing increasingly hoarse in this final week,
but Friday at a rally after the Chicago parade his voice came back.
He was also responding to a CBS poll that showed George Bush's lead
narrowing to seven points.
   ``In 1960, John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson went into that last
weekend down eight points in the polls,'' he told an audience that
went to its feet more than a dozen time. ``We're doing better than
that. You can feel that surge and you can feel that excitement.''
   Dukakis aides say that state polls show the race is tightening in
the key battlegrounds of the Midwest and that Dukakis also has drawn
within striking distance in New Jersey, a state he had all but
written off until this week.
   Dukakis campaign vice chairman John Sasso said Dukakis likely
would add a second campaign stop in Texas on Saturday and was
considering returning to Ohio.
   His New York rally in the city's Forest Hills section was a bid
to block recent Bush inroads among white middle-class voters in
traditional Democratic areas.
   Dukakis, who has dedicated the closing month of the campaign to a
populist appeal with the rallying cry ``I'm on your side,''
ridiculed Bush for borrowing the line in a speech Thursday.
   ``Yesterday, if you can believe it, Mr. Bush took a furlough from
the truth by saying that he was on the side of working American
families. Can you believe that?'' an indignant Dukakis told a crowd
of several thousand people. ``Four days before the election, after
all the symbols and slogans, four days before the election, he tells
you he's on your side. Who's he kidding?''
   The Massachusetts governor's derisive use of the word
``furlough'' also was a slap back at Bush. The word has figured
prominently in Bush's speeches and advertisements in references to a
convicted murderer who escaped while on furlough from a
Massachusetts prison and attacked a Maryland couple.
   Dukakis also criticized Bush's call for a capital gains tax cut,
calling it an unfair windfall for the rich.
   ``He wants to help people who already have it made,'' Dukakis
said. ``We're going to help every American family make it.''
   Dukakis resumed that criticism before a crowd of about 1,500
people who braved a steady rain and gusting winds to attend and
airport rally in Lexington, Ky.
   ``We know whose side he's on,'' Dukakis told the enthusiastic
crowd. ``He's for a $30,000 tax break for the wealthiest 1 percent
of the people in this country.''
   And in New York, Dukakis listed as well his proposals for health
care, economic development and a higher minimum wage and assailed
Bush's record on deficit spending, the environment and the drug war.
   ``They want the American people to forget that they stole from
our children in piling up the biggest debt in history,'' Dukakis
said of the Republicans. ``They stole from our future by trashing
our environment.''
   He also said it was time for a Democratic administration to
``take back our government from the influence peddlers and sleaze
merchants.''
   Dukakis invoked the legacy of Harry Truman and Kennedy in
predicting a close win Tuesday.
   ``Twenty-eight years ago, another son of Massachusetts challenged
us to win the race to the moon, and we did,'' Dukakis said. ``As
president, I want to challenge the people of American to one
fundamental goal: drug-free schools in the 1990s.''
   He repeated his promise to halt foreign aid to countries refusing
to cooperate in international efforts to curb drug trafficking,
again using the strong rhetoric he began on Wednesday.
   ``I'll be damned if I'm going to let them send that stuff into
our country and poison our kids and destroy our neighborhoods,''
Dukakis said.
   In an interview Friday with ABC-TV, Dukakis again brought up
drugs when answering a question on why he thought Bush was running a
negative campaign.
   ``The real question is, `Why has he done this?' and I think it's
to divert attention from a failed record on the war against drugs,
from the kind of sleaze and corruption that we've seen in
Washington,'' he said. ``I think that's what's going on.''

<TEXT>
   The government decided Friday to cut
subsidies to state-owned production by more than two-thirds over the
next four years and increase unemployment benefits for those likely
to lose their jobs as a result, a spokesman said.
   The plan was approved at a meeting of the Council of Ministers
under the chairmanship of Vice Premier Peter Medgyessy, but only
after ``sharp debate,'' the official news agency MTI quoted a
spokesman as saying, without elaboration.
   Zsolt Bajnok, editor-in-chief of the government daily Magyar
Hirlap, acting as spokesman, told Hungarian journalists that the
ministers decided to cut subsidies from the present $2.6 billion a
year to $800 million over the next four years.
   Bajnok said that in 1989, subsidies to the mining industry,
agriculture, consumer goods and other economic sectors would be cut
by $580 million.
   Beginning Jan. 1, an employment fund is to be doubled to $48
million in an attempt to buffer those who will lose their jobs if
unproductive firms are closed when subsidies stop, he said.
   The measures are part of an austerity and economic reform program
begun last year to try to reduce Hungary's $18 billion foreign debt
and stimulate the stagnating economy by providing incentives for
private enterprise and foreign capital investment and introducing
market competition.

   A West German ship turned back by Turkey
because it carried waste material returned to the Black Sea on
Friday after a month in Istambul because of rough seas, a port
source said.
   The source, who spoke on condition he not be identified, told The
Associated Press that the Petersberg, accompanied by three Coast
Guard ships, crossed the Bosporus into international waters of the
Black Sea Friday.
   He said he did not know if the ship would go elsewhere or would
drop anchor in international waters, where it had been from mid-July
until Oct. 4.
   Efforts to reach the ship's captain by radio proved unavailing.
   Ayla Yenidunya, a spokeswoman for the Marti shipping agency, said
Marti stopped representing the Hamburg-based Nielsen shipping
company last month. Nielsen had contracted the ship.
   Turkey barred the Petersberg from its waters when it arrived in
May, intending to dump the waste in Turkey.
   The ship manifest listed the 1,300-ton cargo as industrial sand,
but Turkey's Atomic Energy Commission said an examination showed the
cargo to be a mixture of rubble, pitch, mud, sand and rotten plants.
   The waste originated in Vienna. In a Bonn-datelined dispatch,
Turkey's semi-official Anatolia news agency said West Germany asked
Austria on Friday to take the cargo back.

   Universities and research centers turned computers back on Friday
after purging a ``virus'' from infected machines across the country,
and The New York Times reported that the rogue program was written
by a 23-year-old graduate student.
   The FBI said it was launching a preliminary inquiry to determine
whether federal law had been violated.
   The Times reported that the ``virus'' program was created by a
Cornell University graduate student whose father is one of the
government's most respected computer security experts.
   The Times' Saturday editions quoted two sources with detailed
knowledge of the case as saying that Robert T. Morris Jr., 23, wrote
the program as an experiment that went haywire and jammed more than
6,000 computers nationwide.
   The elder Morris is chief scientist at the National Computer
Security Center in Bethesda, Md., the arm of the National Security
Agency devoted to protecting computers against outside attack.
   Morris, 56, told the Times that the virus ``has raised the public
awareness to a considerable degree,'' he said. ``It is likely to
make people more careful and more attentive to vulnerabilities in
the future.''
   The younger Morris could not be reached for comment Friday, the
Times said.
   At government and university computer centers across the nation,
the big systems were up and running Friday after their operators
finished purging the virus instructions from their machines.
   ``Everything seems calm this morning,'' said Bob Logan, systems
manager at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
``It's just a lot of aggravation right now. ... We want to look and
make sure that besides doing what it (the virus) did it didn't leave
some little time bomb that's going to go off.''
   The virus, a sort of rogue program that reproduced in computers
and apparently instructed them to send copies of itself to other
machines through a research network, ARPANET, slowed computers and
used up memory space. But most operators said the biggest problem
was the time wasted while eliminating it.
   About 1,000 hours of staff time was spent cleaning up some 200
computers at the University of Colorado, said public relations
director Pauline Coker.
   ``There was no real damage. The program is not the big deal _ the
big deal is that it happened,'' said Hans Werner Braun, chief
programmer for the University of Michigan.
   The Times reported Friday that an anonymous caller to the
newspaper claimed that a graduate student had created the virus as a
harmless experiment and became terrified of the consequences when it
got out of hand.
   Once Caltech's computers were disconnected from ARPANET's
electronic mail system and turned back on Thursday night, ``we could
watch the virus trying to spread from infected machines on the
network,'' Logan said.
   ARPANET, established by the Defense Department's Advanced
Research Projects Agency, is used by researchers and defense
contractors to share data at high speed.
   The virus also spread into some government computers, from NASA's
Langley Research Center at Hampton, Va., to the Los Alamos National
Laboratory in New Mexico. Computers used for classified work are
separate from those affected by the virus.
   Computers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, one of
the nation's nuclear weapons design centers, were shut down late
Wednesday, but turned back on and reconnected to ARPANET Friday
morning, said spokeswoman Bonnie Jean Barringer. No data was lost
but research was disrupted for the day, she said.
   Dr. Raymond S. Colladay, the director of the Advanced Research
Projects Agency, told a Pentagon briefing the virus had been
defeated in roughly 24 hours' time.
   Colladay said the computer experts and researchers who use the
system had concluded the virus program, while fairly sophisticated,
did not contain any ``Trojan horse'' bug that could crop up again at
a later time.
   He also said he thought computer experts ultimately could
pinpoint the general geographic location from which the bug was
delivered, but would probably be unable to pinpoint a specific
individual user as the perpetrator.
   In Washington, FBI spokesman William Carter announced the
preliminary inquiry and said a criminal investigation ultimately
would be launched if it is determined federal law was violated.
   The bureau will review the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which
deals with unauthorized access to government computers or computers
in two or more states.
   If records within the computer systems that were ``infected'' are
found to have been destroyed or harmed, the FBI could conduct a
full-scale investigation, Carter said.
   Purdue University computers also were restarted Friday, but
slowly. ``We hope there are no Trojan horses hidden,'' said Steve
Hare, research facilities manager of Purdue's computer science
department.
   Boston University computers were back on Friday but had not been
linked back up with the network, said Mary Riendeau, coordinator of
user services for the computer science department.
   Many institutions didn't discover the virus until Thursday, but
Los Alamos scientists detected it Wednesday evening and isolated
their computers from the network.
   ``It was noticeable, but not catastrophic,'' said Los Alamos
computer security officer Jimmy McClary. He said there was no damage
but a few hundred scientists suffered delays in their work.
   ``We were warned yesterday morning to board up the windows and
protect ourselves,'' said Leslie Maltz, director of computing and
communication resources at Stevens Institute of Technology in
Hoboken, N.J. He would not say who gave the warning.
   ``We'll keep systems removed 'til all clear is sounded, several
days at most I would think,'' Maltz said.
   Carnegie Mellon University computers in Pittsburgh were
inoculated five years ago with programs that recognized the virus
and tried to send the messages back to their return address. When
that proved to be an improper format the system channeled the virus
messages to a file to be examined by humans, said Bob Cosgrove,
director of computing services at CMU.
   But at the University of Illinois, the virus was still causing
trouble Friday.
   ``We went home last night thinking it wouldn't come back because
we had closed the hole it was coming in through, but it apparently
has multiple ways of attacking the system and we got hit again,''
said Charley Kline, senior research programmer at the university.
   It appeared that most infected machines were either Digital
Equipment Corp. VAX or Sun Microsystems computers, and all used BSD
UNIX operating system, the master program that lets a computer run
other programs, said Logan at Caltech.
   It was ``one of the most complex viruses we've seen,'' said John
McAfee, director of the Computer Virus Industry Association in Santa
Clara, a group of 11 computer companies that market anti-viral
programs.
   ``It's been a royal nuisance ... but of the spectrum of things
that could have happened it was the least destructive thing that
could have been done,'' said Bill Johnston, a computer scientist at
the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, part of the University of
California-Berkeley.
   McAfee said the virus took advantage of a little-known flaw in
the send-mail feature of the UNIX operating system as modified by
UC-Berkeley. ``The perpetrator was an extremely sophisticated
individual,'' he said.

   Thousands of moths are dying daily
inside Australia's new Parliament house after being attracted by its
powerful lights, causing a terrible stench and distracting lawmakers
from their work.
   The moths are blocking windows and doorways, littering corridors
and entering the building's air-conditioning system.
   Legislators complained that the tiny flying creatures make it
hard for them to concentrate.
   Minister for Science Barry Jones believes the insects are drawn
to a brightly lit flagpole on Capitol Hill and that the building's
stone-lined walls and recessed windows provide a perfect environment
for the moths, who are killed when they fly into the lights.
   The moths are en route to their summer breeding grounds but
apparently are confused by the bright lights of the building, said
Ebbe Nielsen, a leading Australian moth and butterfly expert.
   An estimated 40 million moths now are in the vicinity of the new
Parliament, which was opened this year.

   Researchers today tried to trace a ``virus'' that infected
computer systems nationwide, slowing machines in universities, a
NASA and nuclear weapons lab and other federal research centers
linked by a Defense Department computer network.
   By Thursday night, the virus had infected hundreds of computers
on what one expert said was the largest scale ever, but authorities
said it apparently destroyed no data even though it temporarily
halted some research.
   Viruses are tiny programs introduced to computers either as a
prank or vandalism. They can attach themselves to other programs and
spread through shared software or ``electronic mail'' systems that
link computers.
   Mild viruses may flash a message on a user's screen, while
``deadly'' forms can destroy data or cripple a computer. This virus
apparently did its damage by rapidly duplicating itself, thereby
slowing computers' processing speed and taking up their memory space.

he feels ``betrayed'' by the American system but will comply with a
judge's order in his federal racketeering case and ``take my

   Marcos and his wife, Imelda, were indicted Oct. 21 by a federal

of plundering more than $100 million from their homeland and
funneling it into Swiss and Hong Kong bank accounts, Manhattan real

   Mrs. Marcos pleaded innocent to the charges in New York on
Monday, but her husband's arraignment was delayed pending the report

   The FBI agent who began a successful
class-action discrimination lawsuit against the bureau says he and
other Hispanic agents have since been harassed, and they are asking
a judge to bar such retaliation.
   A 32-page document filed Thursday in U.S. District Judge Lucius
Bunton's court contains affidavits from three Hispanic agents who
contend they have been singled out and treated unfairly since Bunton
ruled Sept. 30 that the FBI discriminates against Hispanics in
promotions and job conditions.
   FBI spokesman Gregory Jones in Washington denied the allegations,
saying ``any intimidation or retaliation would be illegal and
intolerable, and would result in an FBI inquiry.''
   Bernardo ``Matt'' Perez, who initiated the class-action lawsuit
in January 1987, contended in his affidavit that many of his duties
as No. 2 man in the El Paso office have been taken away, and that
his boss has intimidated another agent for talking to reporters

   New York, Los Angeles and other major cities have
sued the federal government claiming that undercounting in the 1990
census could cost them billions of dollars and deprive minorities of
their political clout.
   ``This is one of the most important civil rights issues in the
country today,'' said Peter Zimroth, New York City's chief attorney.
``To the extent minorities, black and Hispanics in the inner cities
are undercounted, their vote is diluted.''
   The cities contend in the suit, filed Thursday, that the Census
Bureau was prepared to make adjustments to compensate for
undercounting, particularly of minority groups, but that it was
overruled last year by the Commerce Department, its parent body.
   Congressional seats and federal grants are allocated on the basis
of population. If an area is undercounted, it may have fewer
representatives in the House and lose millions of dollars from
Washington.
   The Commerce Department referred all calls to the Justice
Department. Amy Brown, a spokeswoman, said the department had not
yet received the complaint and therefore could not comment.

   President Reagan registered disappointment
Friday over a Soviet decision to suspend troop withdrawals from
Afghanistan.
   Administration officials called the move disturbing and accused
Moscow of raising tensions in the war-torn country, but they
stressed that the Soviets could still meet their commitment to pull
out by Feb. 15.
   During a political campaign stop in Chicago, the president noted
that the Soviets had renewed that pledge even while announcing the
suspension in Moscow.
   At the end of a week of U.S. complaints about new Soviet weapons

   Universities and research centers turned computers back on Friday
after sweeping out a ``virus'' epidemic that infected machines
across the country, a ``royal nuisance'' that slowed research but
apparently caused no damage.
   The virus, a sort of rogue program that reproduced in computers
and apparently instructed them to send copies of itself to other
machines through a research network, ARPANET, slowed computers and
used up memory space. But most operators said the biggest problem
was the time wasted eliminating it.
   About 1,000 hours of staff time was spent cleaning up some 200
computers at the University of Colorado, said public relations
director Pauline Coker.

   President Reagan's signature Friday on
legislation giving a treaty banning genocide the force of American
law marks the end of a 40-year struggle and represents the final
feather in the political cap of retiring Sen. William Proxmire,
D-Wis.
   Proxmire delivered more than 3,300 daily speeches over 19 years
before the Senate voted on Feb. 11, 1986, to ratify the treaty. That
act turned back four decades of opposition by conservatives who
contended it would undermine rights of Americans under the
Constitution and infringe U.S. sovereignty.
   But it took another two-year struggle to win congressional
passage of the legislation needed to implement the treaty by making
genocide _ the deliberate destruction of a specific population _
punishable under U.S. law and setting stern penalties for violators.
   The Senate version of the genocide implementation bill is
officially called ``The Proxmire Act'' to honor the long crusade of
the senator who is closing out a 31-year Senate career.

   Unemployment fell to 5.3 percent in October _
matching a 14-year low _ the government said Friday, as employers
added 325,000 new jobs and floored the accelerator on an economy
that had been slowed by the summer drought.
   In its last major economic report before Tuesday's presidential
election, the Labor Department said the 0.1 percentage point drop
from September's 5.4 percent jobless rate was accompanied by 99,000
new manufacturing jobs, the biggest monthly increase in that
employment category since February 1984.
   But Janet L. Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor
Statistics, cautioned that the October pickup in factory employment
``may be somewhat overstated'' because of a seasonally adjusted
increase of 25,000 jobs in canneries and other food processing
plants.
   Factory jobs had declined by 45,000 in August and September.

<HEAD>Skirmishes in Detroit-Windsor Relations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRETEL WIKLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The smokestack of Detroit's planned trash-burning
incinerator is but another protrusion among the steeples and water
towers rising in an area just north of downtown.
   But in neighboring Windsor, Ontario, the smokestack ranks high on
a growing list of irritants straining relations between the border
cities.
   Fear that the $438 million incinerator's smokestack will send
clouds of acid rain over Canada troubles Windsor, but it's far from
the only problem for the city across the Detroit River from the
sixth-largest U.S. city.
   In the last several months, the cities' ability to get along also
has been challenged by the behavior of Americans in Windsor, concern
about a spill over of drugs and crime from Detroit and the expansion
of Detroit City Airport.
   Even so, Windsor's 200,000 residents acknowledge the benefits of
being Detroit's foreign neighbor.
   The two cities celebrate their friendship every year with the
Freedom Festival, which coincides with Canada's Dominion Day, July
1, and the Fourth of July.
   It was shortly after last year's festival that the incinerator
issue ignited.
   Numerous protests, including one at the construction site in
which 19 demonstrators were arrested, have kept the attention high.
The province of Ontario has sued Detroit to force the city to add
$10 million to $20 million worth of pollution controls, including
lime scrubbers, which remove acidic gases produced when plastic bags
and table salt burn.
   The legal challenge was dismissed in U.S. District Court in
February, but the Canadians appealed to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in Cincinnati, and Jim Bradley, the province's
environment minister, said Ontario will appeal to the U.S. Supreme
Court if necessary.
   Detroit Mayor Coleman Young has predicted defeat of the action,
which he calls ill-conceived. He said the demands would require
spending money on pollution equipment that is yet to be proved
effective.
   ``Obviously when and if it's proven we'll be willing to take a
hard look at it because whatever falls in Windsor falls first in
Detroit,'' Young said.
   Said Windsor Mayor David A. Burr: ``We recognize that when he
(Young) makes up his mind on something, it's very difficult to get
something changed.''
   Burr cited the expansion of Detroit City Airport as another
example of Young's stubbornness.
   The Windsor mayor, concerned about increased air traffic and the
potential for a collision over Windsor, said he asked for a joint
meeting of the two cities' governing boards to discuss the airport
issue and other concerns but never received an answer. Young notes
that planes heading for Windsor fly over Detroit, too.
   Detroit does not seem to be exporting its violent crime across
the border. The three homicides in Canada's City of Roses last year
translate to about 1.5 per 100,000 people. That compares with 645 in
Detroit, or about 54 for every 100,000 people.
   ``I don't really think at this point we can see an increase in
crime,'' said Staff Sgt. John Abbey of the Windsor Police Department.
   Earlier this year, when Windsor police began setting up roadside
stations Friday and Saturday nights where randomly selected drivers
are tested for alcohol consumption, the crackdown raised complaints,
but not from the U.S. side.
   Canadian bar owners said it would scare off young American
patrons who cross the border because they can legally drink at 19,
two years younger than in Michigan.
   A U.S. Customs Service program to tighten control over the
cross-border transport of illegal drugs has resulted in scores of
arrests and seizures of vehicles. Most of those arrested have been
Americans returning from Canada.
   In general, the cross-border passage is cooperative, and now
there's a proposal for a pedestrian ferry.
   Alexander Pollock, an architect for Detroit's Community and
Economic Development Department, said the ferry would make access to
Windsor hotels easier for people attending conventions in Detroit.
   It's a welcome idea in Windsor, where two large hotels are being
built.
   Canada bought $19.2 billion in merchandise in 1986 from Michigan
and four other Great Lakes states, said Paul Bondy, director of the
Windsor and Essex County Development Commission.
   In turn, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Ohio and Wisconsin bought
$16 billion worth of goods from Canada, Bondy said.
   ``Windsor being a lot closer to downtown Detroit than the suburbs
makes us a direct beneficiary of overflow from conventions,'' said
Sergio Grando, general manager of Windsor's visitor's bureau, adding
that Windsor's shops and restaurants, especially the outdoor cafes
along Ouellette Avenue, draw Americans with their European style.
   The Detroit mayor's response: ``Our prosperity reflects itself in
Windsor, and so cooperation would be to me what we ought to be
about.''

   Tyka Nelson's songs come from a very private
world.
   ``I kind of locked my mind away in a bubble. There's a place
where nobody can touch me,'' said Nelson, 28, whose debut album is
called ``Royal Blue.''
   ``The drunks on the street, the killings, the kids with no homes
_ there's a place I can go. The songs come out of that,'' she said.
   Her first single is called ``Marc Anthony's Song.''
   ``Marc Anthony lives in that world, Paris lives there. I imagine
that it's true that they are there.''
   Nelson's romantic streak dates back to her childhood in northern
Minneapolis, when she would watch Shirley Temple and Barbra
Streisand movies. Music runs in the family. Her father, John Nelson,
was a pianist and composer while Mattie Nelson, her mother, was a
singer.
   Then, of course, there was her older brother: Prince.
   ``Mom was singing and daddy playing,'' she recalled. ``My mother
would play her music. I got to listen to lots of different things,
Dionne Warwick and Nancy Wilson. Daddy would listen to Top 40 songs
on the radio. He would have to learn those songs.''
   Nelson recalled seeing her brother's first feature movie,
``Purple Rain.''
   ``I cried through the whole movie,'' she said. ``It was him on
film, like Elvis Presley. It was one of the first times it hit home
that he was really doing something. I just saw his face and tears
started running down my face.''
   Nelson has settled down a bit since ``Purple Rain.'' When ``Sign
O' the Times,'' Prince's latest film, was released, she didn't even
see it.
   ``I don't want to be influenced. He sent me the tape and I
decided I was going to wait,'' she said.
   Nelson also declined to make use of ``Paisley Park,'' Prince's
$10 million recording studio outside of Minneapolis. In fact, she
wouldn't even let Prince help at all.
   ``Prince didn't hear the album until it was finished. They look
and have an idea, then you start doubting yourself.''
   Given her obvious connections, some resentment might have been
expected among the studio personnel. But Nelson said she had no
problems.
   ``Everybody's been very receptive,'' she said. ``I did it away
from him and that was intentional. I've got a lot of pride. I wanted
to know I could do it on my own.''
   Her greatest obstacle was singing with other people in the
studio. ``As soon as people walk in, my heart flutters a little bit.
I turn out all the lights so that's fine. I have to remind myself
they can't see me. The hardest thing is a bunch of eyes peering at
you.''
   Five of the nine tracks on ``Royal Blue'' were produced in
Minneapolis by David Rivkin, a.k.a. David Z., who has worked with
Jody Watley and Sheila E.
   The remaining songs, recorded in Los Angeles, were produced by
Preston Glass, who has worked with Aretha Franklin and Earth, Wind &
Fire, and Larry Graham, the bassist for Sly and the Family Stone.
   The songs on ``Royal Blue,'' co-written by Nelson and Jimmy
Matherly, are a mixture of pop, soul and Princely funk. Nelson calls
it ``A Different Kind of Blues.''
   ``I wanted it to be soothing,'' she said. ``I wanted someone to
be able to put it on and write a letter and talk on the phone and it
wouldn't interfere.''
   Nelson wrote her first song when she was 9 years old and found it
natural to enter the music business.
   ``I thought everywhere around the world, kids when they got into
their teens got into bands.''
   But she doesn't feel like a celebrity. ``I haven't accepted a lot
of things,'' she said. ``It's hard to accept that I can go into a
store and get my album.''
   And there's still the matter of performing live. Nelson will have
many eyes on her when she begins her tour this fall. Her experience
on stage is limited.
   ``I sang at the Hollywood Palace the day after the `Purple Rain'
premiere,'' she said. ``It's fine while you're singing but
afterwards everyone's touching you, saying, `Oh, you've got such a
beautiful voice.'
   ``That's the only time I've sung in my adult life in front of
people.''
   But in her own private way, Nelson is a show business veteran.
   ``I've been doing this for years in my room with my bed as my
audience,'' she said. ``I talk to the people. I dance. I don't stand
still. I look at them but I look through them.
   ``I can't wait to tour.''

   After the Redgraves, the
Carradines and the Douglases, what acting clan could be next?
   Try the Ironses, as the British star Jeremy Irons joins his son
and his father-in-law on-screen in a new film.
   ``It's like a professional home movie,'' he said during a break
in filming ``Danny, the Champion of the World,'' a $3 million
feature due for release in Britain next Easter and in the United
States at a time yet to be decided, either in theaters or the Disney

   The movie is based on Roald Dahl's best-selling children's story
about a father and son bonded together in a morality tale which sees
good winning out over evil. Gavin Millar directs from John
Goldsmith's screenplay.
   The movie brings together for the first time three generations of
thespian talent. Ten-year-old Sam Irons, in his film debut, plays
the resourceful and protective Danny, who lives with his father,
William, in a Gypsy caravan in the country.
   Jeremy Irons, Sam's real-life father, plays his on-screen one.
The veteran Irish actor Cyril Cusack, Sam's grandfather and Irons'
father-in-law, plays the eccentric village doctor, Spencer, who
tends William's foot after it is injured in a trap for pheasant
poachers.
   On the set, the young Irons scampers about in baggy gray shorts,
demonstrating a pocket calculator to his stand-in, Simon Spaull, and
asking excitedly whether it's lunchtime yet.
   The boy seemed outgoing and voluble, but his 40-year-old father
adamantly shielded Sam from the press. He prefers to leave all
dynastic queries to the senior family members, who are accustomed to
such questions.
   The 77-year-old Cusack said he disliked the term ``dynasty'' to
describe a family almost universally smitten with the desire to
perform.
   But with four daughters _ all of whom are actresses _ he
acknowledged such career decisions are often inevitable.
   ``I think it's not so much an inheritance from the genes but an
environmental influence that persuades children,'' Cusack said in an
interview at Twickenham Studios in the West London suburb of St.
Margaret's.
   His daughters are seen regularly on the British stage.
   Nineteen-year-old Catherine is touring England in a theater
adaptation of Emile Zola's novel, ``Geminal.'' Niamh, 28, is
appearing in London's West End opposite Rex Harrison in J.M.
Barrie's ``The Admirable Crichton.''
   Sorcha, 38, ended a one-woman show, ``Baglady,'' in London on
Oct. 1. Sinead, 39, Irons' wife, appeared on Broadway in 1985 with
the Royal Shakespeare Company and this summer in an acclaimed London
production of Brian Friel's ``Aristocrats.''
   Cusack spoke fondly of his grandson's entry into the profession,
which technically began in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1986 with a bit
part alongside his father in Shakespeare's ``The Winter's Tale.''
   ``To begin with, I thought, `Well, what are we going to have here
(on the film)?''' Cusack said. ``Then I noticed the way Sam reacted
to everything. He seems to take acting quite in his stride, without
any stress.''
   Jeremy Irons said acting opposite his son afforded a kind of
shorthand: ``The emotions are unspoken, unplanned, in everything you
do together. That is the plus, I think.''
   He hopes the movie will be ``a little jewel,'' the kind of family
film too rarely seen nowadays.
   ``I know as a parent it's pretty hard to find films to take kids
to,'' said Irons, who is winning raves in the current psychological
drama, ``Dead Ringers,'' a movie distinctly not meant for children
with its themes of gynecology, sex, emotionally disturbed twins and
drug abuse.
   ``We've been through the Spielbergian fantasies, and certainly my
lot are getting bored with them,'' said Irons, referring to the
movies of Steven Spielberg.
   ```Danny' is that rare film I think parents will enjoy as much as
children,'' he said.
   Irons said he hoped ``Danny'' wouldn't push Sam toward being a
full-time actor: ``I don't think you ever wish upon a child a life
that requires you to cope with so many rejections, so many
uncertainties.
   ``He won't do any more of this until he's 17, if he even wants
more of it then.''
   And might Sam's 3-year-old brother, Max, get bitten by the acting
bug?
   His grandfather said: ``Max is splendidly spontaneous and may
shoot into the stellar regions overnight.''
   But his father was more cautious.
   ``He hasn't told me,'' Irons said wryly. ``(But) he may be
harboring it secretly.''

<HEAD>Spectacles Make `War and Remembrance' Worth Watching</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Director Dan Curtis had his work cut out for him
with ABC's ``War and Remembrance,'' a sequel to one of the
most-watched television events of all time, the 1983 epic he also
directed, ``The Winds of War.''
   Based on the first 18-hour installment of ``War and
Remembrance,'' Curtis has himself a masterpiece of a war movie,
interrupted too often by tedious subplots and silly romantic
interludes.
   The $110 million budget bought a heck of a production. The
locations, sets, costumes, cars and special effects are spectacular.
   ABC rushed the first 18 hours of the 32-hour monster onto the
screen this month, three months early, because of scheduling gaps
caused by the summer writers' strike. ``War and Remembrance''
commences Sunday, Nov. 13. The rest will air in 1989.
   Both miniseries were based on Herman Wouk's epic novels. ``The
Winds of War'' followed Victor ``Pug'' Henry and his family through
the events leading up to World War II. ``War and Remembrance'' takes
them through the war.
   Wouk kept control of his work, co-writing the screenplay and
restricting the number and types of commercials ABC could air. Wouk
wisely felt it would be inappropriate to juxtapose powerfully
graphic material with pitches for burgers and fries.
   There have been cast changes since ``The Winds of War.'' Is your
scorecard handy?
   Robert Mitchum, now 70, is back as Pug. He was too old for the
role five years ago, and although he doesn't dodder, he is so
profoundly taciturn, you wish someone would take his pulse _ or at
least offer him an eyelift. Now commander of a cruiser in the
Pacific fleet, he has broken off his almost-affair with plucky Pam,
played nicely again by Victoria Tennant, who is off on a world tour
with her BBC commentator uncle, Alistair Tudsbury (Robert Morley).
   Polly Bergen is also back as Rhoda, Pug's ditsy wife. She has
resumed her inexplicable affair with the remarkably dull Palmer
Kirby (Peter Graves). Their romantic scenes qualify as high camp.
``Palmer, take me to your apartment!'' ``Is that what you really
want?'' ``What do you think, you fool!''
   Steven Berkoff is a kitschy, full-tilt Hitler, blood vessels
popping. Ralph Bellamy does his impression of Franklin Roosevelt as
cheerful nitwit.
   It's hard to imagine pining for the screen charisma of Ali
McGraw, but Jane Seymour is boring as Natalie, the Jewish older
woman married to Pug's son, Byron. Byron is now played by the
capable Hart Bochner, replacing Jan-Michael Vincent. Natalie and her
famous-author uncle _ Sir John Gielgud replacing John Houseman _
traipse tediously about Europe trying to escape the Nazis. Bill
Wallis is wonderfully oily as the German official who poses as their
protector.
   Michael Woods successfully replaces Ben Murphy as son Warren.
Leslie Hope replaces Lisa Eilbacher as daughter Madeline, but
doesn't have much to do this time around. David Dukes returns as
Leslie Slote, the State Department drone who yearns to prove the
rumors of Nazi atrocities.
   Although the miniseries is fraught with too many comings and
goings and so-nice-to-meet-yous, Curtis has managed to keep things
apace with spectacle in just about every episode. The battle scenes
are stunning. The first episode includes some of the best submarine
scenes since ``Das Boot.'' Barry Bostwick gives a first-rate
performance as Byron's buddy and commanding officer, cigar-chomping
Carter ``Lady'' Aster.
   In the third episode, Pug and Warren fight in the battle of
Midway. Again, the scenes are worthy of a theatrical film, even in
the rough cut given to reviewers. The scenes should be even more
spectacular in the final version.
   The concentration camp scenes are the most powerful such
depictions television has ever seen. They are so graphic, ABC will
run advisories before episodes 2 and 7 warning viewers. Adding to
the palpable evil is the knowledge that Curtis filmed at actual
concentration camp sites.
   Although they are rather rotund for concentration camp internees,
Topol and John Rhys-Davies are compelling as Berel and Sammy,
relegated to a dwindling work detail that is forced to dig up
decaying bodies from a mass grave so the Nazis can burn the evidence
of the massacre.
   At the end of seven episodes, viewers are left in 1943 with
Natalie and her uncle in peril, Pug reunited with Pamela in Moscow,
Hitler's generals considering assassinating him, Berel making a
desperate escape, and Byron a reflective war hero.
   Tune in next year.

   You've never heard of Jim Bergthold.
Transformed into an angry bully, he's punched his wife and
threatened everyone in sight, including his bosses. It was either
leave his last job or risk jail for hurting someone. He hasn't
worked since.
   You have heard, almost certainly, of Robert T'Souvas. Two months
ago, he died the most pitiable of deaths, shot in the head under a
Pittsburgh bridge after arguing with his girlfriend over a bottle of
vodka. He was 39, and a bum.
   Twenty years ago, Bergthold and T'Souvas were among thousands of
young Americans sent halfway around the world to fight a war.
Bergthold was a 21-year-old laborer from Niagara Falls, T'Souvas a
19-year-old dropout from San Jose, Calif.
   Chance propelled them into the Vietnamese village of My Lai with
Charlie Company on March 16, 1968. There they took part in the
frenzy that resulted in the slayings of more than 400 Vietnamese
men, women and children. Bergthold and T'Souvas were among 25 men
originally charged in the barbaric attack, although only six stood
trial and just one, Lt. William L. Calley Jr., was convicted.
   The massacre, when exposed a year later, brought home to
Americans the horrors of the distant war and gave a surge to rising
sentiment against it. Bergthold, T'Souvas and other veterans in My
Lai that day were damned and doomed forever.
   Official Army records list only one American casualty at My Lai,
a man wounded by his own rifle. But many more suffered emotional
wounds in the aftermath of a raid made in the mistaken belief that a
Viet Cong battalion was lying in wait.
   Some, like Bergthold, now 41, came home walking wounded _ drunks
and addicts for whom the booze, acid, hash, grass and speed couldn't
blot out the shame and guilt. Shunned by the public, they took
refuge within themselves, becoming suspicious and secretive.
   The memory that most haunts Bergthold is of the Vietnamese woman
he shot point-blank. She was already wounded and lay bleeding and
moaning.
   ``I put her out of her misery,'' Bergthold said. ``I can see her
lift up off the ground after I shot her. It bothers me, knowing what
I did and then have kids of my own. ... Why did the government train
me to kill people?''
   Bergthold has not worked since August 1985 because of post
traumatic stress disorder, the delayed shock of combat. ``Nothing
seems to help,'' he said. ``I can't concentrate. I have no respect
for authority. Little things set me off.''
   He and his wife, Nancy, and two daughters, 16 and 13, live in a
run-down rented house on $698 a month from disability and Social
Security checks. A 20-year-old son lives on his own.
   He has stopped the drugs and drinking. Now tranquilizers keep his
rage in check. The last time he threatened his wife was seven years
ago when he had a flashback and fired a shotgun at her. The pellets
hit the wall.
   ``He kept calling me his enemy,'' she recalled. ``He yelled to
some of the guys in his platoon to look out when he shot at me.''
   Six months later, he tried to stab his son, Tim, then 12. A big
man at 257 pounds, Bergthold has awakened in the middle of the
night, shoving his wife out of bed. ``He was screaming at the guys
to hide,'' Mrs. Bergthold said.
   Life had been downhill for T'Souvas since he was charged with
killing two children at My Lai. The children were already wounded
and T'Souvas wanted to end their suffering, according to his
attorney from the hearings.
   While awaiting court-martial, he lived in an Atlanta commune and
married. He then drifted, working fitfully as a cook, baker, painter
and laborer. He spent eight months in a Birmingham, Ala., jail for
marijuana possession. His wife and son, now 13, left him seven years
ago because of his drug and alcohol abuse.
   After that, T'Souvas hooked up with a carnival worker named
Kathlynn, who uses his last name and has been charged with his
murder. Police say the couple arrived in Pittsburgh late in the
summer of 1987, with T'Souvas hoping for construction work. But the
offer fell through, and he and Kathlynn lived under a bridge, fished
in the rivers, sold their blood for spending money and worked part
time in a food kitchen for the homeless.
   Some veterans saw My Lai as a curse, a jinx.
   ``I got a permanent reminder,'' said Paul Meadlo of Terre Haute,
Ind. ``I got my foot blowed off the very next morning (by a mine).
It must have been God's plan.''
   The 41-year-old Meadlo, who testified under immunity at Calley's
court-martial that he helped Calley shoot villagers because he
considered them Viet Cong, is bitter. When he left the Army, he says
his missing foot made him unemployable. He eventually found work in
a factory that makes plastic film but was recently laid off.
   Four My Lai veterans, all officers, came home in coffins. Even in
death, they were dishonored. Accusations in an Army report ranged
from supervising the systematic killing of civilians to allowing
their men to rape Vietnamese women.
   For some who survived, the My Lai horror crushed careers, even
though they were acquitted or never tried.
   Ernest Medina, commander of Charlie Company, was acquitted of
murder and having over-all responsibility for the massacre yet was
forced to resign his commission after 16{ years' service. Now 52,
Medina owns a real estate company in Marinette, Wis.
   Kenneth Schiel, 41, given an honorable discharge under the
condition that he not re-enlist or join the reserves, says he
probably would have made the Army a career. He is a police patrolman
in Corunna, Mich.
   The stigma of My Lai made a drinking problem worse for Kenneth
Hodges, a squad leader who had 10 years' service before he was
forced out. Unskilled and alcoholic, Hodges said he had to fight
just to get a driver's job with the Veterans Administration in his
hometown, Dublin, Ga. Alcoholism led to two divorces; he has married
a third time and says he has been sober since 1985.
   Charles Hutto, now 39, says he also overcame a drinking problem
that developed as he struggled with the burden of My Lai. He repairs
televisions in Monroe, La.
   Bergthold, T'Souvas, Meadlo, Medina, Schiel, Hodges and Hutto
were among the 25 soldiers first charged with My Lai crimes, ranging
from premeditated murder to assault and rape. Six were eventually
tried, including Medina and Hutto.
   Calley, the one man convicted, was a platoon leader. He served
three years under house arrest for the first-degree murder of at
least 22 villagers, including a boy he tossed into a ditch and shot.
Now 45, he works in his father-in-law's jewelry store in Columbus,
Ga. He will not talk about My Lai.

   People who race today's thin-skinned, knee-high solar-powered
vehicles don't expect the sun to propel commuter traffic anytime
soon.
   But two of Michigan's corporate giants say other benefits make
solar cars worthwhile.
   Dow Chemcial Co. has been the primary sponsor for the last two
years of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology program that built
the winner of the America Solar Cup race in September in California.
   General Motors Corp.'s Sunraycer won the world's first
transcontinental solar car race, held in November 1987 in Australia.
   Dow and GM aren't talking about mass solar-powered transit, any
more than the Wright brothers with their fragile sand-dune flyer
envisioned cargo and passenger-carrying jumbo jets.
   At today's efficiency levels, solar cars are fair-sky vehicles
ideal for the sun-baked Australian outback or Southern California.
   In Michigan, for example, the glimmer of a winter day when the
sun is mostly a memory would scarcely move the specialized race
vehicles, let alone power the all-out daily four-lane sprint to work
or end-of-the-day dash home.
   GM and Dow are enthused, nevertheless. While neither company
divulges what it spends on the special programs, both said the
benefits go beyond the advertising value of having their names on
cars that skitter to racing wins.
   MIT senior James Worden, 21, heads the Dow-supported design team
that built Solectria V, a 12-foot-long racer that basically
resembles a flat array of solar cells topped by a bubble canopy.
   Dow Automotive Materials Group provided materials, technical help
and money for the car, one of the stars of an ESPN television
feature on solar-car racing.
   Dow spokesman Rick Proskow said the car represents an opportunity
to try out its superthin chromaloy tubing, carbon fiber composites,
epoxies and magnesium and aluminum components.
   It weighs just 340 pounds and can travel more than 70 miles an
hour using a power system that generates only 10 horsepower. It
finished the 159.3-mile California race in just over three hours,
averaging 53.1 miles an hour.
   ``There is a great similarity between the car James Worden drives
and what has been done with similar materials in the general
automotive field,'' said spokeswoman Linda Water, who accompanied
the racing team.
   Worden is improving the car, Water said, though ``James is very
close-mouthed about these things. He keeps his briefcase very close
to him.''
   GM's teardrop-shaped vehicle is 20 feet long and weighs 390
pounds. It chalked up a 2{-day victory in a 5{-day World Solar
Challenge race across Australia in November 1987.
   Making it provided lessons in lightweight structures and
materials, efficient lightweight motors and aerodynamics, Bruce
McCristal, a GM spokesman said.
   The Sunraycer is the most aerodynamic land vehicle that has ever
been tested in GM's wind tunnel, he said.
   It has been taken on tour, appearing at more than 130 different
events, and has proven a powerful lure in piquing interest among
school children in science studies, McCristal said.
   A GM educational program based on the car _ including teachers
manuals, students' workbooks and a computer game that simulates
driving it _ has brought strong response from science teachers
across the country.
   ``There isn't really a commercial payoff,'' Proskow agreed.
``We're certainly not going to go out and sell thousands and
thousands of pounds of resin for solar cars. Not today.''
   But he said Dow also values the educational potential.
   ``It gives us an opportunity to support an alternative type of
power and to support a person in college with a good idea. As a
chemical company we are an inventive group. Technology is important
to Dow,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   George Bush was a solid favorite to pick
up Alabama's nine electoral votes Tuesday, but Republicans had
little hope of making substantial gains in state and local races.
   A record 274 GOP nominees were running for office in Alabama, but
state GOP political director Steve French predicted only modest
coattails from the national ticket even in a landslide.
   Alabama went for President Reagan in 1980 and 1984, and Bush was
the lopsided favorite over Democrat Michael Dukakis in a series of
polls over the past two months.
   The makeup of the state's congressional delegation _ five
Democrats and two Republicans _ was not expected to change. The
closest race was in the 1st District between Republican Rep. Sonny
Callahan and Democratic challenger John Tyson.

<HEAD>Heated Battle over Weicker's Seat, Bush Favored</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Democratic Senate contender Joseph I.
Lieberman, once considered a long shot in his challenge to
three-term Republican Lowell P. Weicker Jr., put the seat up for
grabs in the closing weeks of the campaign with an aggressive TV
campaign.
   Republican George Bush led Democrat Michael Dukakis for the eight
electoral votes offered by Connecticut, Bush's boyhood home and
next-door neighbor to Dukakis' home state of Massachusetts.
   A series of attack ads depicting the burly, 6-foot, 6-inch
Weicker as a bear who slept through Senate votes helped Lieberman
wipe out Weicker's commanding summer lead.
   A poll conducted for The Hartford Courant by the Institute for
Social Inquiry at the University of Connecticut and released Tuesday
showed Weicker with 38 percent, Lieberman with 37 percent and 25
percent undecided. The survey, the last major independent poll in
the Senate race, had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5
percentage points.
   The two set a record for spending; Weicker expected to spend
about $2.8 million to Lieberman's $2.5 million.
   In congressional races, the three Democratic and three Republican
incumbents were all heavily favored.

   Michael Dukakis carried a wide lead over
Republican George Bush into Tuesday's balloting for the District of
Columbia's three electoral votes.
   No polls have been conducted in the nation's capital to gain a
sense of the voting, but the Democratic candidate has carried the
city by a wide margin in each of the last fiv presidential
elections. For example, Walter Mondale received 85 percent of the
vote in 1984, as he was being trounced nationally by President
Reagan.
   Walter Fauntroy, the city's non-voting delegate to Congress, was
expected to easily retain his seat. The Democrat, a black minister
and veteran of the civil rights movement, had only token opposition
to his bid for a tenth term.

<HEAD>Bitter U.S. House Race Highlight of Georgia Ballot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House race called one of the nation's nastiest
came to a close Tuesday with Republican Rep. Pat Swindall fighting
both to save his political career and stay out of jail.
   In the presidential race, Republican George Bush was expected to
win Georgia's 12 electoral votes, despite a late surge of
campaigning on behalf of Democrat Michael Dukakis by popular Sen.
Sam Nunn.
   Swindall was expected to lose his 4th Congressional District seat
to Democratic challenger Ben Jones, a recovered alcoholic who played
``Cooter'' in television's ``Dukes of Hazzard'' series.
   Jones narrowly lost to Swindall in 1986. This year's race was
marked by Swindall's repeated references to Jones' arrest record,
especially an assault conviction. Jones, who says he has not had a
drink since 1977, said the incident dates to his drinking days and
involved shoving his second wife in a bar.
   Last month, Swindall was indicted on federal perjury charges
stemming from his testimony to a grand jury investigating a
money-laundering case. He sought a trial before the election as
polls showed Jones a 2-1 favorite in the suburban Atlanta district,
but the jury was dismissed after Swindall's campaign sent out
leaflets saying he had passed a lie detector test.
   Democrats currently hold eight of the state's 10 U.S. House seats.

   A spirited fight over a statewide lottery
dominated the attention of Idaho voters, who were virtually certain
to award their four electoral votes to Vice President George Bush.
   Rep. Richard Stallings, outspending GOP businessman Dane Watkins
by three-to-one, was all but assured of becoming the first Democrat
to win three straight congressional elections in the conservative
southern district. Four-term Republican Rep. Larry Craig was favored
to hold onto the state's other U.S. House seat.
   Opponents of a constitutional amendment allowing a state lottery
spent $500,000 in an effort to turn the voters around from 1986,
when a lottery initiative captured 60 percent of the vote. That
measure was voided by the state Supreme Court on grounds as an
attempt to circumvent the constitutional prohibition against any
lottery.
   Supporters pushed the proposition on economic grounds, arguing
that Idahoans were spending money on lotteries in neighboring
Washington, Oregon and Montana that should remain in the state.
   Critics said a lottery would strip the poor of money they need
for necessities and open the door to casino gambling and the moral
ills that go with it.

   Illinois voters decided Tuesday whether to hand 24
electoral votes to George Bush or Michael Dukakis from a critical
swing state that has sided with the winner in all but two 20th
century contests for the White House.
   Polls showed the Republican vice president with a narrow lead
over the Democrat Massachusets governor. Bush was favored by 46
percent of the state's registered voters and Dukakis by 40 percent
in a Chicago Sun-Times@Channel 7 poll taken in late October. Both
candidates pulled in 44 percent in a similar poll in September.
   Illinois voters also decided whether to call a state
constitutional convention to consider revising the charter adopted
in 1970.
   All nine Republican and 12 of the 13 Democratic representatives
in the U.S. House faced opposition, including House Minority Leader
Bob Michel. Democrat Cardiss Collins in the 7th District near
Chicago was unoppposed.

<HEAD>GOP Hopes to Pick Up Deep South Senate Seat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican Rep. Trent Lott hoped to put
both of Mississippi's Senate seats in the GOP column for the first
time this century, as he battled Democratic Rep. Wayne Dowdy for the
seat of the retiring John Stennis.
   Vice President George Bush appeared to have the state's seven
electoral votes locked up. Democrat Michael Dukakis trailed since
the beginning of the campaign and made little headway among blacks
who supported Jesse Jackson in the March Super Tuesday primary.
   Lott stressed his links to the Reagan administration and Bush in
his bid for the Senate seat. Dowdy, who like Lott surrendered a safe
congressional seat for the race, tried to avoid tying his campaign
to Dukakis. He spent $1.5 million on the election _ half of what
Lott spent.
   Thad Cochran's election in 1978 made him the state's first
Republican senator in more than 100 years. Stennis campaigned for
Dowdy by appealing to voters not to turn both seats over to the GOP.
   Three Democratic congressmen seeking re-election all were
expected to win, including Mike Espy, the state's first black
congressman in more than 100 years. Voters will pick two new
congressmen to fill the seats vacated by Lott and Dowdy.

   Republican Sen. Chic Hecht battled for a
second term against popular Democratic Gov. Dick Bryan on Tuesday,
the incumbent buoyed by polls that showed him climbing from underdog
to virtually even.
   In the presidential race, state Republican Chairman Steve Wark
predicted George Bush would take Nevada's four electoral votes with
a victory margin as high as 25 percent. But Democrats said
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis still had a chance.
   The Senate race had opened with Hecht trailing as much as 30
points in opinion polls. But it ended a tossup, with Bryan claiming
a lead of 10 percent or more and Hecht, helped by President Reagan's
last-minute visit, releasing polls showing a 2-point edge for the
governor.
   Bryan suffered late in the campaign when Dukakis reversed himself
and said he accepted Congress' designation of Nevada as the site for
the nation's first high-level nuclear waste repository.
   Democratic Rep. Jim Bilbray and Republican Rep. Barbara
Vucanovich both appeared headed for re-election.

   Gov. Jim Martin was favored to become the
first Republican chief executive ever re-elected in North Carolina
on Tuesday after a tough campaign against Democratic Lt. Gov. Bob
Jordan.
   In the battle for the state's 13 electoral votes, Republican
George Bush led Democrat Michael Dukakis.
   Martin, 52, a former college chemistry professor and six-term
congressman, fended off charges by the challenger that his
administration had been unethical and incompetent.
   Jordan, 56, is a millionaire lumber company executive who
presides over the state Senate, where he served four terms before
his 1984 election as lieutenant governor.
   A recent Mason-Dixon Opinion Research survey showed Martin
leading Jordan 51 percent to 43 percent with 6 percent undecided.
Bush led Dukakis 52 percent to 40 percent with 8 percent undecided.
The telephone survey of 826 likely voters was conducted Oct. 24 and
25 for several news organizations and had a margin of error of 3.5
percentage points.
   In the hottest congressional race, Rep. Howard Coble, a
Republican from Greensboro, faced a stiff challenge from former
state legislator Tom Gilmore, a Democrat. Coble won a second term in
1986 by 79 votes in one of the nation's most volatile districts. The
state currently is represented by eight Democrats and three
Republicans.

   Sen. Quentin Burdick expected to lead a
Democratic sweep of key statewide offices Tuesday, even though
Republicans counted on keeping the state's three presidential
electoral votes in the GOP column for George Bush.
   In addition to the Senate seat, Democrats were favorites
according to public opinion polls to hold on to the state's lone
U.S. House seat and the governor's office.
   Burdick maintained a 2-1 lead in University of North Dakota polls
over Republican state legislator Earl Strinden, despite GOP
accusations that the 80-year-old incumbent isn't mentally and
physically fit to serve a fifth full term.
   Rep. Byron Dorgan and Gov. George Sinner also had commanding
leads in their races for re-election.
   The presidential race was rated a toss-up at Labor Day, but both
sides acknowledged that George Bush's success in portraying Dukakis
as a liberal helped the Republican mount a probably insurmountable
lead.

   A proposal for the strictest statewide
anti-smoking law in the nation went before Oregon voters Tuesday, as
did a presidential race rated too close to call.
   The initiative measure would ban smoking in virtually all
workplaces and public accommodations. It made Oregon a key
battleground for tobacco companies, which put $2 million into their
fight to defeat the proposal.
   In the presidential race, Democrat Michael Dukakis held a slim
lead over Republican George Bush in a poll four weeks before the
election. But state GOP Chairman T.J. Bailey predicted Bush would
win 55 percent of the vote to capture the state's seven electoral
votes.
   Oregonians also will vote on measures to repeal Gov. Neil
Goldschmidt's order barring state government discrimination against
homosexuals, require seat belt use by all motorists and increase
cigarette and beer taxes to help finance college sports.
   The three Democrats and two Republicans in the Oregon House
delegation all sought re-election.
   Portland Mayor Bud Clark, an exuberant tavern owner, was favored
to win a second four-year term in a race against a former police

   Two spirited congressional races topped the
ballot in South Carolina, where Republican George Bush's dominance
in the presidential race over Democrat Michael Dukakis was never in
doubt.
   Bush's efforts in the state, which offered eight electoral votes,
were bolstered by Gov. Carroll Campbell, his Southern campaign
chairman, and Aiken native Lee Atwater, his national campaign
manager.
   In the 2nd District, Republican Rep. Floyd Spence came from
near-death and a double-lung transplant in May to lead Columbia
banker and attorney Jim Leventis. Spence, seeking his 10th term,
attacked Leventis as a liberal, while the challenger accused Spence
of being ineffective.
   Fourth District Rep. Liz Patterson, a first-term Democrat, faced
a tough challenge from Republican Knox White, a Greenville attorney
and city councilman. White accused Ms. Patterson of being too
liberal for the district, while the incumbent called herself an
independent thinker running against an opponent with a ``bumper
sticker mentality.'' Republicans were intent on reclaiming the seat
held by Campbell until his successful 1986 run for governor.
   Currently, Democrats hold four of the state's six congressional
seats.

   Bitter debates on a proposed tax limit and
two measures aimed at protecting the Black Hills from surface mining
dominated the campaign in South Dakota, where the presidential race
appeared very close heading into Tuesday's election.
   State party officials described the battle between George Bush
and Michael Dukakis as a tossup, and the two candidates made late
campaign appearances to bid for the farm vote that could decide who
takes South Dakota's three electoral votes.
   The harshest words of the campaign were exchanged by supporters
and opponents of a proposed constitutional amendment to limit
property taxes and two measures calling for stricter reclamation
standards and higher taxes on surface mines. A plan to allow limited
gambling in Deadwood faced no organized opposition.
   Democratic Rep. Tim Johnson appeared to have a comfortable lead
as he sought a second term as South Dakota's lone member of the U.S.
House.

   Former Democratic Salt Lake City Mayor Ted
Wilson, riding the crest of voter dissatisfaction with Gov. Norm
Bangerter, carried a shrinking lead in the polls into Tuesday's
election against the Republican incumbent and a tax-cutting
independent.
   Vice President George Bush, meanwhile, was expected to have no
trouble taking Utah's five electoral votes from Democrat Michael
Dukakis, and GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch was the prohibitive favorite for a
third term over Democrat Brian Moss.
   The first-term Bangerter angered voters with a record $166
million tax increase in 1986 and trailed Wilson by as much as 30
percentage points in polls. But he closed the gap to 40 percent to
32 percent in a Salt Lake Tribune poll released Oct. 30. Merrill
Cook, a Republican-turned-independent who has championed three
tax-cutting ballot initiatives, polled 26 percent.
   Those initiatives, which would reduce state and local government
revenue by more than $300 million, appeared headed for defeat.
   Republican Rep. Howard Nielson and Democratic Rep. Wayne Owens
appeared headed for re-election. But the state's third congressman,
GOP Rep. James Hansen, was in a tough fight with Democrat Gunn
McKay, whom Hansen ousted in 1980.

   Republican Rep. James Jeffords was

Tuesday, while Bernard Sanders, a self-described socialist who said
he wanted to shake things up on Capitol Hill, made a strong bid for
Jeffords' old seat.
   The presidential race for Vermont's three electoral votes was

   Democratic Gov. Madeleine Kunin appeared headed for a third
two-year term as the state's first woman governor.
   With the state's lone House seat open for the first time in 14

   Sanders, the mayor of Burlington, pointed to an in-house poll

Sanders by 30 and Democrat Paul Poirier by 18 percent, with the rest
undecided.
   Jeffords, a moderate Republican, was heavily favored in the

   In the presidential race, a sizable lead in public opinion polls

   The Senate race was marked by heavy campaign spending, a sharp

   Polls had shown Kohl with a healthy lead, but the race appeared

   Phil Reibel went to Vietnam, a gentle man
in a time of war. He returned, a violent man in a time of peace.
   So began his odyssey from platoon to prison.
   Today, the Marine veteran passes his days behind gates, his
nights behind bars, doing time for brutally assaulting his son. He's
not sure Vietnam put him there, but he has no doubts the war turned
him inside out.
   ``Before I went to Vietnam, I never had any violent streaks,''
said the bearded, 41-year-old Reibel. ``When I came back, I had
nothing but violent streaks. ... The day I came home and the day
before I left, I was a completely different person.''
   Reibel is among thousands of Vietnam veterans in prisons
nationwide who wonder whether their time as warriors in jungles half
a world away helped turn them into criminals on the streets at home.
   Five years ago and long after he came home, Reibel beat his
teen-age son and pushed him over a stool. The boy's head hit the TV,
temporarily paralyzing him. Reibel's sentence: 6 years, 8 months, to
10 years.
   ``I had no control over myself at that time,'' Reibel said. `` As
far as guilt, shame, I'll have to suffer that forever. ... I'm doing
a life sentence.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Like other Vietnam veterans, Reibel's war story began in a
distant land. A generation later, it's still being written _ back
home, in a prison cell.
   ``They're one of the forgotten legacies of the war,'' said Wayne
Smith, membership services director of Vietnam Veterans of America
and a former Army medic who served time for manslaughter.
   ``There are those who are missing in action, and there are those
who are missing in America ... the incarcerated veteran,'' he said.
``The problem is very real. It's one we don't look at daily because
of the height of the walls. Nevertheless, they're there. There's a
key turned every day.''
   These men have become prisoners of war of another sort. At the
end of 1987, state prisons held 20,876 veterans who served in
Southeast Asia in the Vietnam era, Justice Department records show.
Another survey, taken in 1979, found 12,957 inmates in such prisons.
Federal prison officials have no such breakdown.
   Thousands more Vietnam vets have previously served time or are on
probation or parole, experts say. And a recent survey found 470,000
vets, one in seven, suffer from post traumatic stress disorder, a
psychological condition sometimes marked by flashbacks and
nightmares that has been cited in criminal defenses.
   That condition was linked to two vets who have been executed. One
argued that flashbacks drove him to kill a rookie policeman. The
second man, who killed two people in a robbery, dug foxholes beneath
his house and locked himself in his room after he returned from the
war.
   Some experts suspect a higher proportion of Vietnam veterans
ended up in prison than those who served in other wars, although no
statistics support that.
   The reasons they give for the perceived higher incidence of
imprisonment: the nature of the war _ no clear enemy lines _ and
lack of decompression time.
   ``Vietnam combat veterans were guerilla fighters and (moved) from
the theater of war to their home porch often in less than 36
hours,'' said John Wilson, a Cleveland State University psychology
professor and expert on post traumatic stress.
   ``It's almost like a deep sea diver coming up too quickly and
getting the bends,'' explained Charles Figley, Purdue University
professor of family therapy and psychology.
   Many still thought like warriors. ``A lot of the men were walking
around with jungle-trained survival instincts,'' Wilson said. ``They
were prepared to react to stress incidents as they did in Vietnam.''
   One Michigan inmate, Jim Armstrong, explains: ``You go over there
and you kill as many of them as you can before they kill you. The
whole time in your training ... it was ... kill, kill, kill. What
you don't kill, burn down. So when you come home, it's, `No, man,
don't kill no more. Go back and build Chevrolets.' How can you do
that?''
   Some experts also point out that many young Vietnam soldiers were
poor, with few job skills. When they returned, ``they had two
strikes against them,'' said Michael Boivin, psychology professor at
Spring Arbor College in Michigan.
   ``A lot of these guys were at risk anyway,'' he said. ``I don't
blame Vietnam'' for the criminal acts committed. But for some,
``Vietnam pushed them over the edge.''
   At times, vets say, the war even worked against them in court _
prosecutors portrayed them as Rambos, trained killers, adept with
guns.
   The road from combat soldier to convict is a concern to scholars
and veterans groups, who are conducting studies, testifying before
lawmakers about effects of post war stress and working to establish
halfway houses and a clearinghouse to track these so-called
``forgotten warriors.''
   Vets-turned-inmates do support each other. Of 373 Vietnam
Veterans of America chapters, 24 are in prisons, with 3,000 members.
More are being organized. A Missouri chapter unites inmates with
vets who work at the prison, including the warden, who served five
tours in Vietnam.
   Here in Jackson, two prisons have nearly 200 members in three
chapters. They are grouped by security level.
   In one group, inmates at the State Prison of Southern Michigan,
the world's largest walled prison, speak of a society they say has
victimized them twice _ first branding them murderers, now
stigmatizing them as convicts.
   ``The media and the American people ... (felt) a Vietnam veteran
... was either a babykiller or a walking timebomb,'' said inmate
Armstrong. ``When he lost control once ... they said, `OK, let's put
this timebomb in prison where if he explodes, all he can hurt is
other criminals.'
   ``There's no thought about, well, did the war have anything to do
with it? Should we offer this guy an alternative? Should we put him
in therapy? Should we try to readjust him to society that he didn't
get readjusted to from coming from Vietnam?' No, let's just lock him
up.
   ``We ain't no criminals,'' added Armstrong, who shot his wife in
the jaw during a fight. ``We just made a mistake. ... We as a group
try to figure out how did we end up doing what we did, how did it
happen? Everybody else in (prison) is trying to figure out ... how
did I get caught?''

   In some ways, imprisoned Vietnam vets do differ from other
inmates _ they tend to be more cooperative, more reclusive, less
involved with gangs, said Wilson, the Cleveland State professor.
   While some are hardened convicts, he said, others have no
criminal mentality but their post-war lives have unraveled. Wilson
said there's a direct link between post traumatic stress and drunken
driving, disorderly conduct, assault and weapons charges.
   Reibel, who was found guilty but mentally ill of child torture,
said his anger simmered for years. Records show he had a history of
assaulting his son before his arrest. ``I thought about (Vietnam)
everyday for 10 years and was afraid to say anything,'' he said.
   Some also say the public's intense anti-war feelings made their
return all the more traumatic.
   ``Everybody that came back from World War II was a war hero,''
Armstrong said. ``When I come home, (I thought) `Man, I'm a war
hero.' (But) you're one of the four horsemen. You're death riding on
a horse.''
   Most Vietnam vets readjusted well, but Armstrong and others got
into bar fights, drank heavily, drove recklessly. Some called it
their death wish. Others say Vietnam destroyed their priorities.
   ``Things that were important before I left weren't important
anymore _ friends, family, success,'' said George Fisher, who robbed
a shoe store to support a drug habit he picked up in Vietnam.
   The notion of right and wrong blurred, too.
   ``When you grow up and they teach you ... don't hit a girl ...
when you get over there ... what if this little 16-year-old kid
happens to be a girl and firing that Mauser at you?'' asked inmate
Ken Everhart, convicted of criminal sexual conduct against his wife,
from whom he was separated.
   ``People look and say, you're ... sick, pathetic,'' said
Everhart, who's been married five times. ``I say, you beat me down.
You've got me down. I'm tired. I'm tired. I'm 41 ... years old. I've
been fighting Vietnam for 21 years now. Vietnam destroyed my value
system.''

   The Karens, an ethnic group in Burma, have been
fighting a guerrilla war against the Burmese government for four
decades. This year's political upheavals in Rangoon have given them
and other rebel groups new hope for success. An Associated Press
correspondent recently travelled with Karen guerrillas inside Burma
and filed this report.

<TEXT>
   The rebel commander, chewing betel nut
and quoting the Bible, pulls up the pants legs of his fatigues and
points to scars from mortar and bullet wounds he said he suffered
when the fighting began 39 years ago.
   As he remembers battles past, the crunch of an exploding mortar
shell rolls through the river valley like thunder; a heavy machine
gun opens up with short bursts. Nearly 1,500 feet above us, among
thick jungle and jagged limestone, his guerrilla unit of the Karen
National Union (KNU) is trying to dislodge some 500 Burmese
government holdouts from their last positions.
   His chin studded with gray stubble, a green beret on his thinning
hair, 65-year-old Brig. Gen. Hla Htoo is leading yet another
operation in one of the world's longest-lasting and least known
conflicts.
   The mission at hand is to retake Mae Tah Waw, an encampment
ringed by hills the Burmese troops seized from the Karen rebels in a
1984 offensive. Astride one of several major smuggling routes
between Thailand and Burma, it provided the Karens with substantial
income from taxes on the illegal flow of gems, teak, livestock and
basic consumer goods.
   But the ultimate objective of the Karen rebels, going back to
1949, is greater autonomy from the central government in Rangoon and
the right to maintain their distinct Sino-Tibetan language and
culture, which includes Christianity, in the wake of inroads by the
Burman majority, which is Tibeto-Burman and almost totally Buddhist.
   Upheavals this past summer in Rangoon, featuring the rise of a
democratic movement following 30 years of authoritarian rule, has
given the Karens new hope. In the wake of the disorders and
bloodletting, more than 5,000 anti-government students and others
have fled cities in Burma's heartland to the Thai-Burmese border,
where the Karens have carved out their domain.
   The Karens today operate in 1,350 miles of border area extending
from northern Thailand down into the Burmese strip on the Andaman
Sea to the border of Malaysia.
   Merely to close with one's enemy requires gruelling effort in the
frontier areas of eastern Burma where Htoo's group operates.
   For three hours we climb the embattled hill of Mai Pan Le, using
bamboo ladders to scale vertical cliffs and clinging to vines and
bamboo on hillsides turned to slick mud by monsoon rains.
   On a trail hacked through the jungle, we meet a line of silent
guerrillas each hauling a single rocket that will take hours to
deliver to frontline positions and just seconds to be fired.
   Barefoot porters soaked in sweat materialize from the gloomy,
humid netherworld carrying the almost naked body of a young rebel
fighter strapped hands and feet to two bamboo poles. A neat reddish
spot marks where a bullet entered his forehead.
   Atop the rooster-comb ridge, a dozen Karen soldiers crouch behind
rocks overlooking a saddle where the Burmese have dug in. Rifle
bullets whine over the outpost where the soldiers have already spent
10 difficult days.
   Burmese soldiers can be seen scurrying around their bunkered
positions below and one guerrilla pops up from his cover and arches
a shell from his M-79 grenade launcher towards them. From another
Karen outpost, hidden from sight on a hilltop far behind us, the
heavy machine gun tries to rake the same target.
   But by most standards, the Karens are stingy with their
ammunition.
   ``Every mortar shell we fire costs us 1,000 baht ($40),'' says
one officer. ``We are poor revolutionaries.''
   The soldiers on the hilltop, says a medic, have received only
plain rice for rations which they supplement with leaves and berries
gathered from the stony escarpment. Water has to be portered from
below in plastic cans and there is virtually no shelter from the
alternating heat and monsoon rainbursts.
   As we move along the ridgeline, the young medic stops to tighten
the shoelaces he has tied around his boots to keep the soles from
falling off.
   Gen. Hla Htoo estimated that at any one time a quarter of his men
are down with malaria, which is endemic in territory under Karen
control and strikes him almost every year.
   The Burmese army _ product of a wrecked, isolated economy _ also
wages war on a shoestring. From the ridge, we see the jungle
stretching westwards to the horizon, and through it the Burmese must
resupply their forward positions over ambush-prone trails and roads
passable by vehicles only in the dry season.

   Whereas the Karens buy their ammunition and other supplies in
Thailand, across the swift flowing Moei River below us to the east,
the closest Burmese rear base from the beleaguered troops is 40
tortuous miles away miles away. Porters who fled the Burmese lines
said they had been rounded up in Rangoon, threatened with execution
and made to haul supplies without being provided with either pay or
food. The shoulders and backs of some were worn raw and bloody.
   The Karens say banana leaves, a sign of a lack of food supplies,
were found in cooking pots when they overran several Burmese bunkers
after close quarters combat which often climaxes days or weeks of
slow advances and preparatory fire.
   On one of three hills already taken by the Karens around Mae Tah
Waw, Karen officers say they had to literally pry the Burmese from
the rocks. A special commando unit reportedly scaled sheer cliffs
seeded with mines as the defenders desperately hurled grenades
downwards. Later, the bodies of the dead Burmese were thrown off the
hilltop.
   After trapping Burmese inside a cave, the Karens said, they
sealed off its mouth with branches and leaves and set a bag of
chillies afire. An hour later two gasping, red-eyed soldiers emerged
to surrender.
   There are no known statistics, but thousands are believed to have
died on both sides in what some historians call a ``civil war'' that
erupted when the Karens and later the Kachins, Shans and other
minority groups felt betrayed by a central government that was,
after independence from Britain in 1948, to have granted them some
autonomy under a federal union.
   The Karen National Union set up its capital and military
headquarters in Manerplaw, a quiet village set along the Moei River
with thickly forested, mist-streak hills as a backdrop. Simple
wooden buildings housing the KNU's 12 administrative departments, a
jail, church and the home of President Bo Mya ring a parade ground
where a bugler daily sounds reveille and retreat.
   Nearby, the young are recruited into the KNU and trained. There
is a separate barracks for women soldiers, with wooden rifles used
in training stacked outside. Inside, an girl still of the age to be
playing with dolls sits on the wooden communal sleeping platform
among her few possessions, sadly holding a baby chick in the palm of
her hand.
   Soldiers and their families receive free rice, salt, fish paste,
sometimes tobacco and chillies, as well as the rudimentary education
and medical care the KNU can provide. Widows of those killed are
helped until they remarry. But there is no pay for enlisted men or
officers.
   Many of the current leaders, including Gen. Hla Htoo, joined the
rebellion in 1949, although enmity between the Karens and Burmans
stretches back far longer.
   British colonials in the 19th century found the Karens able
soldiers, ever willing to help put down Burman uprisings and
banditry. American Baptist missionaries gained many converts among
them, descendents of whom carry names like Maj. Aaron and Col.
Sampson and credit the Christian God with their victories.
   Hla Htoo, himself a Baptist, is not yet ready to declare the
battle won and if he does take all of Mae Tah Waw the military
situation will simply revert to what it was before the big Burmese
attack in 1984.
   It is now evening, a light rain falls but the gunfire above
continues. The dead guerrilla tied to the bamboo poles _ one of five
Karens killed over the past 24 hours _ finally reaches a ramshackle
monastery where Hla Htoo has set up his command post.
   ``There will be no retirement for me,'' says the general,
spitting out betel nut juice and studying his campaign maps.

   After waging a backwater rebellion for
four decades, Burma's Karens hope the flight of thousands of
students to their remote jungle bases will slot their cause into the
broader struggle against a harsh military government in Rangoon.
   Since the government crushed a popular uprising in September,
more than 5,000 students and others have fled cities in the
heartland to the Thai-Burmese border. Here, the the Karens have
carved out a domain complete with schools, tax collectors, soccer
teams and a fighting force said to number 17,000 guerrillas.
   The Karen National Union, probably the strongest of a dozen
ethnic minority rebel groups, claims to control most of the
1,350-mile frontier and administer roughly 1 million of Burma's 6
million to 7 million Karens. The KNU's weapons are purchased on the
black market of neighboring Thailand with income largely derived
from taxes on massive, cross-border smuggling.
   ``The Burmese population will now have a better view of the
ethnic revolutionary groups because of the students,'' KNU President
Bo Mya said in an interview. ``Together with the students and God's
help we will win the war.''
   Karen leaders also say the recent mass killings of demonstrators
and other human rights violations in Burma may make the
international community and the majority Burmans realize they and
other ethnic minorities have had just cause in fighting the Rangoon
government.
   ``The students will offer some harassment but not enough to make
a difference against a tough, battle-hardened force that has shown
itself to be unified,'' a Western diplomat based in Rangoon said
recently. To date the students have received minimal military
training and malaria has already cut a swath through their ranks.
   The Karens themselves have scored victories in recent months,
taking advantage of the Burmese army's preoccupation with putting
down internal revolt. But the turmoil has also disrupted the massive
cross-border smuggling which funds the KNU.
   KNU territory is administered by 12 departments including those
handling foreign affairs, agriculture and justice. The latter
punishes adultery by 10 years' imprisonment and bans all liquor
sales.
   The strict moral outlook appears to originate from 19th century
American Christian missionaries: KNU leaders are invariably fervent
Baptists or Seventh Day Adventists, attributing their victories to
``God's grace.''
   After Burma was granted independence by Britain in 1948, Karens
rose up in revolt, feeling betrayed by a Rangoon government that was
to have granted ethnic minorities considerable political autonomy
and the right to foster their individual cultures and languages.

   As a century's soot and cobwebs are wiped
from millions of stored-away records, a preservation project is
beginning to document the birth, growth and demise of what some
historians consider America's once most influential company _ the
Pennsylvania Railroad.
   The Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission has undertaken
the project with nine other institutions around the nation to save
the company's records, from locomotive blueprints to the personal
correspondence of executives.
   Their goal, according to Robert Dructor, director of the
commission's division of archives and manuscripts, is to organize
the records into a cohesive collection accessible by computer.
   The effort should also help answer questions about the
corporation that was the United States' largest until World War I.
   It started in 1846 as a transportation company but steamrolled
across the Northeast and into the Midwest, consuming competitors,
until it eventually operated steel, oil and coal companies, too.
   While the outlines of the Pennsylvania Railroad's history are
well known, the old documents are revealing intriguing historical
details that fill out the picture.
   One recently discovered 1899 note to the railroad president
threatened to sabotage the rails.
   ``I have blackmailed the PRR Co. for $50,000,'' said the writer,
who signed as Red Mail. ``Don't put me down as a crank or insane, I
am as responsible for what I do as you. I am getting old, poor and
desperate. I may put a limited express over a dump any time.''
   Dructor said archivists have yet to discover whether the
extortionist carried out his threat.
   ``It's still a mystery,'' he said.
   The decline of industry in the Northeast, the growth of the
country's highway systems and development of the commercial air
industry have all been identified as contributors to the
Pennsyvlania Railroad's demise. The paper trail could help show more
precisely how and why, Dructor said.
   Ian S. Fischer, a mechanical engineering professor at New Jersey
Institute of Technology, has delved into some of the documents to
find information about rail freight cars, a long-time fascination
that he hopes, someday, to turn into a book.
   The memoranda, he says, put researchers ``inside things that
happened years ago.'' One example was how freight car designers had
to make changes to accommodate the ``huge demand for industrial
goods by the warring nations of Europe'' just before America entered
World War I.
   The volume of documents is staggering.
   The first phase of the project required the appraisal of some
300,000 cubic feet of records, or about 900 million pages of paper,
Dructor said. Of that, about 8,000 cubic feet were identified to be
saved and approximately 3,600 cubic feet were assigned to the state
archives for processing.
   The two-year project is expected to be completed by February 1990
at a cost of about $260,000, Dructor said. The National Endowment
for the Humanities is providing a $100,000 grant; other
contributions of cash, goods and services completed the funding.
   Documents in the collection range from blueprints and tracings of
Pennsylvania Railroad locomotives, station buildings, bridges and
routes, to photographs of trains, war-era posters, and design
sketches for conductor uniforms. There are also real estate and
accounting books as well as legal papers.
   ``I just couldn't possibly have imagined that there was so much
material going back as far as the 1860s still existing,'' said Joe
Acri, who contacted the state archives looking for details of trains
to help him make accurate models at home.
   After viewing thousands of tracings and blueprints, he said,
``They made drawings of individual nuts, bolts, screws, coat racks,
coat hooks, even the layout of lanterns and tools kept in locomotive
tenders. The detail is phenomenal.''
   Two project archivists and several full-time commission staff
members are sifting the records.
   Documents since 1968, when the railroad merged with the New York
Central to become Penn Central (later Conrail) remain sealed, under
the railroads' policy requiring a 25-year moratorium on opening
corporate papers, Dructor said.
   The documents preceding that time are more than enough to keep
the researchers busy, however. Once completed, they hope the
collection will prove useful to genealogists, archivists and
railroad buffs alike, Dructor said.
   Jean Morris, editor of a magazine for the Western Pennsylvania
Genealogical Society, said the collection could help fill gaps in
family histories of railroad workers.
   ``You can get some insight into the men that worked for the
railroad .. where they lived, how they worked, what jobs they had
with the railroad,'' Mrs. Morris said. ``There are very little
traces of many of them in county records because many of the people
who worked for the railroad moved around so much.''

<HEAD>S&Ls Trying To Have It Both Ways</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the eyes of some industry observers, the
nation's savings industry, facing an expensive internal crisis, is
trying to have it both ways _ more government protection and less
government regulation.
   The industry's oldest and largest trade grop _ the U.S. League of
Savings Institutions _ says Congress should preserve S&Ls as a
separate system because they're important to home lending.
   On the other hand, S&Ls don't want to give up the new investment
powers they acquired through the Reagan administration's program of
deregulation.
   At the trade group's 96th annual convention in Honolulu last
week, its leaders promised to push for tougher supervision.
   But last month when banking regulators asked Congress for power
to levy daily fines against rule-breaking institutions, the industry
didn't support the request.
   S&Ls say they don't want their regulator, the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board, merged with commercial bank agencies. But, neither do
they want the government to block healthy S&Ls from fleeing the
problems of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. by joining
the banks' deposit insurance fund.
   ``They want to have their cake and eat it both,'' said H. Joe
Selby, a Dallas consultant and former top regulator in the Federal
Home Loan Bank of Dallas.
   The FSLIC, which insures deposits in the nation's 3,048 savings
and loans is in deep trouble. Sixteen percent of its member
institutions are insolvent and another 13 percent are dangerously
close to it, with capital levels of less than 3 percent of their
loans and other assets.
   S&L executives say they can't provide the estimated $45 billion
to $50 billion to that will be needed to prop up the insurance fund
without toppling the healthy institutions into insolvency too.
   But, they also know that if taxpayers pay, Congress will attach
conditions designed to prevent a repeat of the disaster.
   Fearful that those conditions will spell the end of a savings
industry separate from banking, the U.S. League is portraying S&Ls
as partners in the American dream of home ownership.
   ``They're trying to tug on the heart strings of Congress in order
to loosen up the purse strings,'' said R. Dan Brumbaugh, a private
analyst who was formerly chief economist of the bank board.
   But, Brumbaugh said, the S&L organization will be handicapped
next year by the belief in Congress that it has been ``tacking back
and forth somewhat erratically.''
   In 1986 and 1987, when the administration pushed for a $15
billion, industry-funded bond issue to provide cash to the insurance
fund, the lobby group tried to hold it to $5 billion, eventually
compromising on $10.8 billion.
   ``The perception is that the U.S. League understood the problem
was greater but disengenously argued for less than was needed,''
Brumbaugh said.
   While S&L leaders at the convention called for a return to basic
mortgage lending, few were willing to go back entirely to the old
days of tight restrictions on thrifts' investments.
   ``Some of these areas need to be looked at, but we don't want to
see a wholesale rolling back of what an S&L can do,'' said Roy
Green, president of County Savings Bank, Santa Barbara, Calif., a
former U.S. League chairman.
   Sandra K. Johnigan of Coast-to-Coast Financial Corp. of New York
says thrifts need power to invest in a variety of higher-earning
ventures in order to attract money from new private investors.
   ``It's not possible to get thrifts out of trouble with just
mortgage lending,'' she said.
   U.S. League leaders say they would accept some new restrictions,
including limits on commercial real estate lending and on
investments in junk bonds, but the better answer is strong
supervision by federal examiners.
   Theo H. Pitt Jr., a North Carolina S&L executive who just
finished his term as U.S. League chairman, said the Reagan
administration in the early 1980s ignored industry pleas for more
examiners.
   However, at the same time, U.S. League promotional material brags
about newspaper stories calling it a ``formidably effective'' lobby.
   M. Danny Wall, chairman of the bank board, said S&L leaders are
engaging in ``revisionist history'' if they claim they were strong
proponents of more supervision.
   ``If they are the lobbying power they would have people believe,
they either opposed enforcement or they failed to be effective in
assisting us,'' Wall said in an interview.
   He said the league missed an important opportunity last month to
help regulators get an enforcement tool somewhere in between
shooting _ closing an S&L down _ and a slap on the wrist _ a warning
letter.
   A bill authorizing regulators to impose fines died before
Congress adjourned.
   Brumbaugh, who believes that S&Ls have closer ties with their
regulators than perhaps any other industry, said the U.S. League is
striving to maintain a separate thrift system because its leaders
believe they will lose power if they don't.
   However, the league also defends the right of better off S&Ls to
leave the FSLIC, which charges insurance premiums 2{ times the
premium charged by the banks' fund.
   Frederick L. Webber, a former Ford administration assistant
Treasury secretary installed Thursday as the U.S. League's new
president, acknowledged his group has a ``credibility problem'' with
Washington.
   ``Without passing judgment on what happened before I got here ...
I'm going to do everything I can to restore our credibility. ... I
along with my staff and my elected leaders are going to tell the
truth,'' he said in an interview.
   Webber also acknowledged tension within the league between
institutions that have stuck primarily with mortgage lending and
those who have ventured into new areas.
   ``I'm not saying we don't have room for the other people (who
have diversified) but they have to understand that both for
political and business reasons, we have to stick to our knitting,''
he said.

<HEAD>Dukakis' Gun Control Stance Provides Ample Ammunition for Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis' long-time support for tighter
government controls on handguns provided ample ammunition for George
Bush and the National Rifle Asociation.
   Dukakis, who supports a federal seven-day waiting period on
handgun purchases and a ban on ``Saturday Night Specials,'' accused
his opponent of distorting his stance on gun control.
   ``I've always supported the right of hunters and sportsmen to own
weapons and (for) people to protect themselves in their own homes,''
the Democrat said.
   Dukakis backed the so-called Brady amendment to impose a uniform,
mandatory seven-day waiting period on handgun purchases in all
states. Bush opposed the Brady amendment, which went down to a
228-182 defeat Sept. 13 after intense lobbying by the NRA.
   Bush, a lifetime member of the NRA, elicited cheers from crowds
across the South and West whenever he declared his opposition to new
federal gun controls.
   ``I'm a sportsman, I'm a hunter, (I) like to do it, and I don't
believe we need the federal government going forward with gun
control legislation,'' Bush told a rally in Billings, Mont.
   In opposing a federal waiting period, Bush found himself on the
opposite side of several national police organizations, worried
about the vagaries of state laws. Only 22 states now bar instant gun
purchases.
   Dukakis vehemently denied ever telling a gun owners' lobbyist,
``I don't believe in people owning guns, only the police and
military. And I am going to do everything I can to disarm this
state.''
   In 1976, Dukakis supported a Massachusetts referendum to ban
private ownership of handguns. The referendum failed.
   Dukakis currently favors the ban on Saturday Night Specials, as
well as ``additional efforts to keep guns out of the hands of the
criminally or mentally dangerous, including background checks.''
   Dukakis boasts that as governor he supported a law setting a
mandatory one-year prison sentence for those illegally carrying a
gun, and stiffened penalties for felonies commited with a firearm.
He says 22,000 Americans are killed each year with handguns.
   At one point the Dukakis campaign threatened a lawsuit against
the NRA over ads berating the Democrat's record on guns and crime.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, long a favorite of the NRA, came to
the defense of his running mate, saying, ``I saw those ads about
Mike Dukakis going to take the guns away from you. I sure wouldn't
be running with any fellow if I thought he was going to take my
shotgun away from me.''
   Bush said he supports ``mandatory sentences for those caught
using a gun during a crime.'' But in a letter to the NRA, the
Republican attacked what he called the ``gun control myths.''
   ``Those who invent these myths threaten more than the rights of
our 70 million gun owners and 25 million hunters,'' Bush said.
``Federal licensing, gun registration, background checks, or a ban
on firearms to name a few, would only restrict the rights of the
law-abiding, leaving criminals free to commit crimes with illegal
weapons.''
   Dukakis told a crowd in Pueblo, Colo., that the charges he is
against gun ownership are ``a lot of baloney.''
   ``What I'm concerned about is teen-agers in major cities of this
country running around with Uzis and AK-47s (automatic military
weapons) and killing people'' in street gangs and drug deals,
Dukakis said. ``That's the kind of thing that's got to be
controlled, not innocent sportsmen who have a perfect right to
hunt.''
   Bush, as a congressman from Houston, voted for the original
federal Gun Control Act of 1968. That law, enacted after the
assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., barred convicted
felons from buying or owning guns and banned interstate and
mail-order sale of handguns.
   But Bush says he also supported the 1986 McClure-Volkmer Act that
allowed the interstate sale of rifles and shotguns.
   Bush, in his campaign literature, says, ``I have always opposed
federal gun registration or licensing of gun owners.'' But he added,
``We must balance the legitimate interests of gun owners with the
rights of society. ... We must do all we can to keep guns out of the
hands of convicted criminals.''
   In a debate with other Republican candidates before the Gun
Owners of New Hampshire last Feb. 2, Bush said, ``I'm not only a
hunter but I'm a lifetime member of the NRA. I do have a deep
appreciation for the Second Amendment rights'' to keep and bear arms.

   Crime would have been a big issue in the 1988
presidential race even if convicted murderer Willie Horton hadn't
gotten out of a Massachusetts jail on a weekend furlough.
   The cocaine epidemic, gang warfare and escalating street violence
in big cities all helped push the crime issue onto center stage with
an urgency unseen in a presidential race since Richard Nixon's
law-and-order campaign of 1968.
   Both George Bush and Michael Dukakis vowed to ``take back our
streets'' and promised new assaults against drug traffickers,
hoodlums and white-collar criminals.
   Some criminologists expressed surprise that crime commanded such
attention in the race. Crime rates have fallen during most of the
1980s and, despite a recent turn upward, remain much lower than in
the late 1970s.
   ``There's just a widespread sense among the public that people
are seriously at danger, even though they are at less danger than
they were five or eight years ago,'' said Alfred Blumstein, dean of
the School of Urban and Public Affairs at Carnegie Mellon University.
   Drug use is off among teenagers, according to
government-sponsored surveys, but the cocaine and crack trade has
spawned violence that shocked the public, like the assassination
last spring of a New York City policeman, Edward Byrnes, who was
guarding the home of a witness in a drug case. Byrne's father
recently gave Bush his son's shield.
   ``The violence and the drug problem run together,'' said Hubert
Williams, president of the Police Foundation and former police
director in Newark, N.J. ``People have felt the sting. They see a
deterioration in our society in our ability to deal with it.''
   ``I see that violent crime is a great civil rights question of
our time,'' Bush told students at the University of Notre Dame. ``An
old woman who is afraid to go out for a break after dark is every
bit as oppressed as a political prisoner in some totalitarian
country.''
   Dukakis, for his part, said, ``I've led the fight against crime
and drugs in my own state and I intend to do so as president.''
   But despite Dukakis' boast that crime in Massachusetts has
dropped 14 percent in the past four years and the state has a
homicide rate 50 percent below the national average, the governor
found himself under constant attack by Bush on two emotion-laden
crime issues: the death penalty and the Horton furlough.
   Bush's advocacy of the death penalty for cop-killers, drug
kingpins, terrorists, traitors and others, and his pillorying of
Dukakis over the furlough program won him the endorsement of police
groups in Boston, New York City and elsewhere.
   Dukakis opposes the death penalty under any circumstances. Polls
indicated the public viewed the Democrat as soft on crime.
   James Lynch, an assistant professor of justice at American
University, said, ``Crime often becomes a lightning rod for people's
frustrations. ... I think it's possibly a code word for something
else. It could be racism.''
   As Republican fliers and ads made clear, Willie Horton is black.
His victims were white.
   Horton, serving a life sentence without parole for fatally
stabbing a 17-year-old gas station attendant in a 1974 robbery,
never returned from his 10th weekend furlough in June 1986. Ten
months later, he broke into an Oxon Hill, Md., home, attacking
Clifford Barnes and his fiance. Later captured in a shootout, he now
is back behind bars serving two life terms plus 85 years in a
Maryland prison.
   Dukakis sought to blunt the Bush attack by pointing out that
every other state and the federal government has a furlough program.
   Citing crime sprees by other furloughed prisoners, including one
from a Houston halfway house that Bush once honored, Dukakis said:
``I think when you use human tragedy for political purposes, that's
kind of the ultimate cynical act in politics.''
   But Bush said the Massachusetts furlough program, begun in the
1970s by a Republican governor, Francis Sargent, was the most
liberal in the nation and the only one that allowed lifers not
eligible for parole out on passes.
   Dukakis vetoed a 1976 bill that would have made first-degree
murderers ineligible for furloughs and defended the policy against
mounting criticism until it was suspended by his state Department of
Correction last December. Dukakis signed legislation last April
revoking furloughs for first-degree murderers.
   National crime statistics show crime up 1.8 percent last year,
ending a five-year decline. And 34.7 million people were victimized
by criminals.
   More than 200,000 furloughs were granted last year for 53,000
inmates across the United States.
   There are 800,000 inmates in U.S. prisons and jails, and prison
reformers say that only the Soviet Union and South Africa have
higher incarceration rates than the United States.
   Many prisons are overcrowded and the problem is getting worse.
   ``The big question is how can we deal with the volume of cases
flooding our judicial systems and our penal institutions,'' said
Williams. ``Furlough programs are a release valve.''
   Bush has promised to double federal spending on prison
construction in his first term, providing an extra $250 million a
year. There are now 44,000 prisoners in 51 federal institutions;
84,000 are expected by 1995 because of tougher sentences.
   The Republican also wants to convert idle military bases into
state and federal prisons, and ``make the criminals help pay the
rent on their prison stays'' by using the confiscated assets of drug
traffickers and racketeers to help pay for prison construction.
   Bush promises to create an anti-gang unit in the Justice
Department, and says no one should be allowed out of prison until
they test drug-free.
   Bush vows to ``throw the book at inside traders and other
white-collar criminals,'' and promises to appoint judges who ``have
a little more sympathy for the victims of crime and a little less
for the criminal.''
   Dukakis promises to ``fight a real war, not a phony war, against
drugs.''
   He charges Bush botched his assignment in the Reagan
administration to coordinate anti-drug efforts in Florida. He also
ridicules Bush's involvement as Central Intelligence Agency director
and as vice president with Panama leader Manuel Noriega, now under
U.S. indictment for drug trafficking.
   Dukakis has vowed to cut off U.S. aid to countries that ``send
their poison into the United States.'' Bush has not ruled out
cutting off foreign aid as a tool in the war on drugs, but he has
suggested he is skeptical of such a move.
   Dukakis says he, unlike Bush, has a proven record in
Massachusetts in fighting crime. ``I didn't learn my lessons about
crime from a Clint Eastwood movie. I've been out there with you,''
he told Hispanic officers in Los Angeles.
   Dukakis also emphasizes his support for compensation for victims
of crime, and says he would create a National Anti-Crime Council to
help coordinate the fight.
   Dukakis also promises to crack down on tax evaders whom he says
cheat the Treasury out of $110 billion a year.
   The Republican scoffs at that, saying it would mean ``an IRS
auditor in every kitchen.''
   ``I have confidence in the honesty of the American people,'' says
Bush.

Tax</HEAD>

   George Bush, an oilman before he became a
politician, aims to revive the ailing U.S. oil industry with tax
incentives and encourage alternative fuel sources, including nuclear
power.
   Michael Dukakis, his rival for the presidency, says a strong
domestic energy industry ``is vital to the security of our nation,''
and he promises to target assistance to small and medium producers.
He has fought efforts to license the controversial Seabrook nuclear
plant in New Hampshire, just over the Massachusetts border.
   Both presidential candidates oppose oil import fees or tariffs.
Both also oppose increasing the federal tax on gasoline.
   Both see a larger role in America's future for natural gas and
coal, and both favor pressing ahead with research on ways to burn
coal cleanly. The two laud alternative fuels such as methanol from
natural gas, and ethanol from grain.
   While energy issues have not received the same attention in the
presidential race as has the environment, each candidate has laid
out detailed positions on energy issues:
   Here is an overview:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BUSH</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Republican says oil and gas will remain America's main source
of energy for a long time. He says the nation must ``find more and
conserve more,'' applying ``our best technology and ingenuity''
while protecting the environment.
   Bush says almost 100,000 oil wells ``have been abandoned because
they are not economic at low prices and high taxes.'' He says he
will try to reverse the fortunes of the domestic oil industry with:
   _Tax incentives for stripper wells.
   _A 10 percent tax credit for oil and gas exploration up to $10
million of costs and 5 percent above that.
   _Expanding the research and development tax credit to include
enhanced recovery techniques.
   _Eliminating 80 percent of intangible drilling costs as subject
to the alternative minimum tax for independent producers.
   Bush says he will keep filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve,
with a goal of 740 million barrels by 1993.
   Although Bush has called for a moratorium on drilling in
environmentally sensitive tracts such as parts of northern
California, he generally favors oil drilling on the outer
continental shelf.
   ``There is no way to meet our energy requirements without
offshore drilling,'' Bush says. But, he adds, ``A few tracts ... are
so sensitive environmentally, aesthetically or commercially that
they should not be leased.''
   He wants Congress to decontrol natural gas prices. ``We should
fully decontrol natural gas and seek more competitive transportation
of gas,'' Bush says. ``Gas decontrol alone will save the average
consumer household $25 to $40 a year.''
   On nuclear energy, Bush says, ``As long as the highest safety
standards are maintained, nuclear power must be a part of our energy
mix.''
   He supported the law this year that gave states the right to
raise their speed limits to 65 miles per hour, which increases fuel
consumption.
   Bush headed a Reagan Regulatory Task Force that was instrumental
in repealing federal requirements for energy efficiency in new
buildings.
   Bush also favors repealing fuel economy standards for automobiles.
   Bush advisers say the tax incentives favored by Bush could
increase production by 600,000 barrels a day and cost $600 million
in annual tax revenue.
   Domestic oil production is currently about 8.2 million barrels a
day, or 9 percent below 1985 levels. The industry has lost 300,000
jobs since then.

<HEAD>DUKAKIS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Massachusetts governor says, ``We have no national energy
policy today _ only a morass of conflicting ideologies and regional
interests.''
   He has promised to take steps to:
   _Insure ``against the economic catastrophe of a disruption in
foreign oil supplies.''
   _Encourage a strong, health energy industry.
   _Promote conservation and fuel efficiency.
   _Make sure that energy policies do not conflict with
environmental goals, including reduced acid rain and urban ozone
levels.
   Dukakis says he would keep filling the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve and seek closer ties with such oil-supplying nations as
Canada, Mexico and Venezuela as insurance against disruption of
Middle East supplies.
   To stimulate oil and gas drilling, Dukakis promises ``a
counter-cyclical program to assist ... energy-producing regions when
times are tough.''
   He said he will ``target assistance on small and medium producers
who do most of the exploratory drilling,'' and phase out the program
when oil prices and rig counts move back up.
   He would tie the federal aid ``to comparable assistance or tax
relief by the state,'' and suggested one possibility would be ``a
temporary abatement of federal taxes'' on income produced from new
wells.
   Another possibility, he said, is to restrict a portion of the oil
purchased for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to oil from new
fields, and to pay a $5 per barrel premium for it.
   Dukakis says he would expand the $10 million federal research
budget for enhanced oil recovery techniques.
   On natural gas, Dukakis says he would seek ``to remove the
barriers that prevent distribution companies, utilities and large
industrial customers from bargaining directly with producers.''
   Dukakis would use price incentives and regulations ``to spur the
use of ethanol and methanol,'' and maintain rules requiring auto
producers to build more fuel-efficient cars.
   Dukakis says he will appoint Nuclear Regulatory Commissioners
``dedicated to strong enforcement of safety standards.'' He says the
federal liability limit that protects the nuclear industry in the
event of accidents is ``outdated and unnecessary.''
   He opposes building new nuclear plants until safer reactors are
designed and safe ways are found to treat and dispose of waste.
   Bush favors exploration of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in
Alaska, a good drilling prospect. Dukakis opposes it.

<HEAD>Gun Control, Car Insurance, Abortion Among Ballot Issues Facing
Voters</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Retransmitting to CORRECT cycle designator.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters in 41 states will have their say Tuesday on 238 ballot
contests addressing some of the nation's most emotional social and
pocketbook issues: abortion, gun control, taxes, strip-mining,
nuclear power, AIDS, smoking, even auto insurance.
   Nowhere are ballot issues more numerous nor the stakes higher
than in California, where voters will wade through 29 statewide
measures on Election Day and scores of additional local propositions.
   Topping the list, Californians will decide among five conflicting
measures aimed at curbing auto insurance premiums and reforming the
rate setting process. Supporters and foes have spent $60 million on
the contest. Insurers alone, fearing the start of a nationwide
``insurance revolt,'' have pumped in $42 million to sway voters.
   Californians will also consider an AIDS measure promoted by Paul
Gann, an AIDS sufferer himself and author a decade ago of the
landmark tax-cutting Proposition 13. Opposed by the medical
establishment, the measure would, among other things, do away with
the state's anonymous testing program and require state officials to
trace the contacts of anyone testing positive for the virus.
   Among notable local initiatives, Fort Collins, Colo., voters will
decide whether to affirm homosexual rights. Cape Cod, Mass.,
residents will consider curbs on development, as will some two dozen
California towns. Nevada City, Calif., citizens may ban steel traps.
The college towns of Berkeley, Calif., and Cambridge, Mass., may
endorse Palestinian rights.
   Other key contests:
   _ Abortion: A close vote is forecast over a bitterly-fought
Michigan measure outlawing tax-financed abortions for the poor. A
proposed Arkansas amendment would ban tax-financed abortions and
protect life from conception. Voters in Colorado could decide to
repeal a similar amendment.
   _ Smoking: In Oregon, voters may toughen that state's
already-strict anti-smoking ordinance with a measure banning smoking
in most public places. Californians will decide whether to boost the
cigarette tax from 10 cents to 35 cents a pack and use proceeds to
promote health.
   _ Gun Control: A $4 million media blitz by the National Rifle
Association has apparently tightened the battle over the possible
repeal of a 6-month old state law banning cheap handguns known as
``Saturday Night Specials.''
   _ Taxes: Colorado Amendment 6 reducing income and property taxes
could cut state revenues by $700 million. South Dakota and Utah
voters will also decide tax-limiting measures. In Arkansas, the
``Fair Tax Amendment'' supported by Gov. Bill Clinton would make it
easier for the legislature to increase the income tax.
   _ Gambling: Kentucky, Idaho and Minnesota voters could clear the
way for a state lottery. Proceeds from the Minnesota lottery would
be earmarked for environmental and wildlife preservationl if under a
companion measure. Indianans will consider legalizing both a lottery
and parimutuel betting, while in South Dakota, voters will decide
whether to allow gambling in Deadwood, the town where Wild Bill
Hickok was shot 112 years ago while playing poker.
   _ Nuclear Power: Massachusetts voters could force the shutdown of
its two nuclear power plants. Nebraskans will consider whether to
become the first state to pull out of an interstate nuclear waste
disposal compact.
   _ Strip-mining: In Kentucky, the coal industry is fighting a
proposed amendment limiting the right to strip-mine. A South Dakota
measure would require strip miners to restore land to original
contours where possible.
   _ ``English Only:'' Florida, Arizona and Colorado voters could
declare English their states' official language. A last-minute court
challenge could block the Florida referendum.
   _ Gay rights: An Oregon initiative would revoke Gov. Neil
Goldschmidt's year-old order forbidding discrimination against state
employees because of sexual orientation.
   _ Seat belts: Under the banner of personal freedom, Montanans
will get the chance to repeal a year-old law requiring motorists and
passengers to wear seat belts. Oregon voters may pass a new seat
belt law.
   _ Crumbling roads: New York Gov. Mario Cuomo is strongly backing
a proposed record $3 billion borrowing to fix roads and bridges.
   _ Family farms, Animal rights: South Dakotans will decide whether
to allow only family farmers to operate hog confinement facilities.
In Massachusetts, a proposed measure would direct the state to
ensure that farm animals were protected from cruelty.
   _ Wages and Benefits: A Massachusetts referendum could repeal the
state's 74-year old ``prevailing wage'' law requiring communities to
pay union wages and benefits on public projects. In California,
Proposition 97 would require restoration of funds for the California
Occupational Safety and Health Agency, which was dismantled by Gov.
George Deukmejian last year.
   _ Bottle bill: Montanans will decide whether to become the tenth
state to mandate return deposits on beverage containers.
   _ Hazardous Waste: Environmental groups are backing Washington
Initiative 97 giving the state unilateral authority to order
hazardous waste sites cleaned up, impose stiff fines and pursue
criminal sanctions against polluters who balk. Rival Initiative 97B
backed by the business community and most state legislators would
allow business time to negotiate.
   _ Tort Reform: Florida residents will consider a proposed
constitutional amendment limiting damages for bodily injury claims
to $100,000 for non-economic losses such as pain and suffering or
mental anguish.

<TEXT>
   The scarred and bruised valleys of Wales
are turning green again.
   The proud but downtrodden Celtic nation has painfully weaned
itself from the coal and steel industries that once made it the
energy capital of the world.
   It has wrought a dramatic economic revival based on service
industries and manufacturing that have changed not only the physical
face of Wales but also the way of life of its citizens.
   Many of its 2.8 million people are enjoying a new prosperity, a
new optimism, born of the ecomomic revival of the 1980s.
   The key to its success has been its ability to attract outside
investment and foster local entrepreneurship, both of which are
creating much needed jobs, above ground.
   ``It is probably the fastest changing and fastest growing economy
in Western Europe,'' Peter Walker, the British government's Welsh
secretary, said in an interview. ``I think it's a very exciting
scene.''
   ``All the signs are that the economy is more prosperous than at
any time in the last half century,'' said Roger Mansfield, director
of the University of Wales' Cardiff Business School. ``A complete
change from an industry dominated by coal and steel to a very mixed
economy has opened up a lot of opportunities.''
   The physical transformation is most obvious in its southern
valleys where coal was once king.
   The scarring and bruising were described by the late Welsh writer
Richard Llewellyn in his heart-wrenching, 1939 classic, ``How Green
Was My Valley.''
   ``The first thing I saw was the slag heap,'' said the main
character, a miner's young son called Huw Morgan, about his first
outing after a long convalescence.
   ``Big it had grown, and long and black, without life or sigh,
lying along the bottom of the Valley on both sides of the river. The
green grass, and the reeds and the flowers, all had gone, crushed
beneath it.''
   But today, in a Rhondda Valley spot once covered with coal slag,
you now can find a cluster of luxury homes overlooking two man-made
lakes nestled in green hills.
   This is part of a multimillion-dollar government program to
reclaim and landscape slag heaps all though the valleys.
   ``We're trying to get away from that image of Wales as black and
grimy,'' said Stephen White, a Welsh Development Agency official.
   The revival also is physically visible in the Welsh capital,
Cardiff, where an ambitious, estimated $2.7-billion,
government-supported redevelopment program is under way in the south
side docklands, an area covering 3,000 acres or one third of the
city.
   Meanwhile, men who once went down into the dark mines _ where, as
Huw Morgan well knew, the work was hard and dangerous _ now have
jobs in such places as an insurance company's claims-processing
office or a Japanese-owned television assembly plant.
   Said Lyn Arnold, another Welsh Development Agency official: ``In
most communities, there is somebody doing well, and everybody is
hearing about it.''
   Ian Kelsall, head of the Confederation of British Industry in
Wales, said: ``The shopping centers are flourishing in south Wales,
holiday travel is up. You can see it in membership of golf clubs.''
   Numbers underscore how big a wrench it has been: One man in 100
works in Wales' coal industry today compared with one in three in
the early 1920s.
   Today, the service sector accounts for 65 percent of employment,
manufacturing 24 percent, primary industries such as coal mining 6
percent and construction 5 percent.
   Wales' gross domestic product grew almost 7 percent in 1986, the
most recent year for which the statistics are available, after a
15-percent spurt in 1985. Its manufacturing index stands at 115.9 in
contrast to 100 in 1980.
   The unemployment rate has fallen to 10.3 percent, representing
125,300 people, from a peak of 16.8 percent, or 172,000 people, in
March 1986.
   The turnaround, however, is not without critics.
   They hold that too many Welshmen remain jobless and that the
improvement is confined to the southeast and northeast regions of
Wales, which covers a total area of 8,018 square miles, about the
size of Massachusetts.
   Critics also say Wales' jobs are particularly vulnerable to
cutbacks because they are dependent on inward investment by
companies that are headquartered elsewhere.
   ``It seems a very dangerous situation to have your whole economy
based on outside investment which can be whipped out at any time,''
said Dafydd Williams, general secretary of Plaid Cymru, the Welsh
nationalist party. ``It has been said that most schemes are to take
advantage of cheap labor.''
   The new-found prosperity also has exacerbated a shortage of Welsh
managers, and of skilled workers in general.
   Wales already was running short because the mines didn't create
many managers or teach a wide variety of skills, and because
ambitious Welshmen tended to emigrate in the past.
   The Welsh have consistently supported socialist political parties
and many critics blame Wales' economic problems on Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's capitalist economic policies. Nationalists blame
what they see as Wales' loss of independence.
   Wales was brought under English rule by King Edward I in 1282 and
united with England in 1536. Today it sends 38 members to the House
of Commons, eight of whom are Conservative.
   It was the recession of the early 1980s that broke the backs of
the long-declining, overmanned coal and steel industries.
   Wales was harder hit by that downturn than other areas of
Britain, as intertwined pits and foundries were closed.
   Massive layoffs cut the number of coal workers from 30,000 in
1979 to 7,500 today, and the number of steel workers from 55,000 to
20,000, the Welsh Office said.
   Overall employment levels since have been helped by the
significant amount of job-creating inward investment in
manufacturing and services by the Japanese and other foreign
investors, some of whom have been seeking a European foothold before
1992, when the European Economic Community is to become barrier-free.
   Last year, Wales became the favorite location in Britain for
overseas investors, who also have been attracted by financial lures
and by the proximity to London, which is under 150 miles to the east.
   Wales won 302 investments in 1987, or one-fifth of all the
investment that came into Britain, according to the Invest in
Britain Bureau.
   Many jobs have also been created by the emerging Welsh
entrepreneurship.
   ``It used to be said at one time that the Welsh aren't
entrepreneurs, that they are teachers and preachers,'' Kelsall said.
   But, ironically, severance payments gave laid-off miners the
capital to start their own businesses.
   As a result, Wales counted 152,000 self-employed people last
December, compared with 115,000 in 1975, the Welsh Office said.
   These optimists have created a mixed bag of farming and local
service companies, and small manufacturers are starting to export
their products, Arnold said, with pride.
   Walker said: ``Now bright young men are staying in Wales and a
lot of bright young Welshmen who left are coming back.''
   As little Huw Morgan would have said, ``There is lovely.''

   RJR Nabisco Inc.'s management are making a
sweetened $20.7 billion cash-and-stock offer for the food and
tobacco giant, raising the stakes from an earlier record bid from a
powerful New York buyout firm.
   Management and its financial partners said Thursday they would
pay $84 in cash and $8 in securities for each share of RJR Nabisco,
slightly more than the $90-a-share tender offer launched by Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts & Co. and higher than an initial $75 a share buyout
proposed by management.
   Either deal, if successful, would rank as the largest U.S.
takeover ever.

   After months of strong resistance, Macmillan Inc.
threw its support behind British publisher Robert Maxwell's $2.51
billion takeover offer for the publishing and information services
giant.
   The move Thursday paved the way for Maxwell's successful
completion of his tender offer for all of Macmillan's shares and his
biggest step yet toward his goal of creating a global communications
powerhouse.
   It came one day after the Delaware Supreme Court effectively
blocked Macmillan from proceeding with an agreement to sell the
company to an investment group that included the buyout firm
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and Macmillan's senior management.

   Long-dormant apparel sales continued reviving during October, but
consumers still spent gingerly on other merchandise, the nation's

   Sears, Roebuck and Co. said Thursday its overall sales were up

Drexel from assisting anyone in acquiring, directly or indirectly,
Stevens or its business assets for a term of one year.''

   A prominent trader with ties to financial giant
American Express Co. is the latest target of a federal crackdown on
Wall Street crime, but his lawyer has denounced the charges and
accused prosecutors of abuse.
   The 22-count indictment announced Thursday against Salim B. Lewis
and the brokerage he owns, S.B. Lewis & Co., charged him with
manipulation and other frauds in connection with American Express's
sale of Fireman's Fund Corp. stock more than two years ago.
   The indictment, which carries enormous potential penalties, is an
indirect outgrowth of the Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal, and
Manhattan U.S. attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani said others might be
charged.
   Stanley Arkin, Lewis's attorney, said his client was innocent and
would fight the charges. Arkin harshly denounced Giuliani's office
for prosecuting the matter.
   ``The allegations are totally off the wall,'' Arkin said.
``Twenty-two counts of this piece of garbage reflect a kind of
mindless abusiveness of the people who brought this case. There's no
possible justification.''
   He added: ``There's a great difference between being a tough
prosecutor and being ruthless, and this over here is ruthlessness,
completely unjustified on any basis.''
   American Express was not named in the indictment, but was
portrayed as the intended beneficiary of the alleged manipulation
scheme. The company quickly denied any wrongdoing and said it has
been cooperating fully with federal investigators.
   Giuliani, whose office has been leading a crackdown on Wall
Street corruption that has resulted in numerous indictments, told
reporters Lewis allegedly conspired with others to manipulate upward
the stock price of Fireman's Fund, an insurance concern partly owned
by American Express.
   The prosecutor said the manipulation took place when American
Express was about to price an offering of Fireman's Fund stock it
wished to sell. One of the objectives, Giuliani said, was ``to make
sure that American Express maximized the proceeds that it received
from that offering.''
   He would not elaborate on whether anyone inside American Express
participated in the alleged scheme.
   Lewis, 49, has a close working relationship with American
Express, one of the nation's biggest financial services firms and
parent of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., a leading Wall Street
investment house.
   American Express retained Lewis to conduct major transactions in
the past, At the time of the alleged manipulation, it had a
substantial investment in S.B. Lewis and has about a 20 percent
stake in the firm now.
   The indictment alleged that Lewis requested two unidentified
employees of the Los Angeles-based brokerage firm Jefferies & Co.
buy more than 400,000 shares of Fireman's Fund on the New York and
Pacific stock exchanges on May 8, 1986, in attempt to drive its
price up to $38 a share, substantially above its price at the time.
   The indictment also accused Lewis of promising to reimburse the
Jefferies employees for any losses they might incur and of hiding
his role in the transactions through phony records.
   The day after the alleged manipulation, American Express said it
would sell 8 million shares of Fireman's Fund at $41.50 a share. It
eventually realized a gain of $88 million from that sale.
   Giuliani acknowledged that some information used to obtain the
indictment was provided by Boyd L. Jefferies, the founder of
Jefferies & Co., who settled civil securities-law violations with
the Securities and Exchange Commission last year and has been
cooperating with federal investigators.
   Jefferies originally was implicated by Boesky, the most famous
insider trader in U.S. history. Now imprisoned, Boesky also has been
cooperating with the government in other securities fraud
investigations.
   Lewis and his firm were charged with various counts of
conspiracy, stock manipulation, mail fraud, wire fraud, phony record
keeping and margin violations. For an individual, each count carries
a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. For a company, the
penalties range from $500,000 to $2.25 million per count.

   Here is a list of important dates in the takeover
fight for the publishing and information services giant, Macmillan
Inc., which agreed Thursday to be acquired by British publisher
Robert Maxwell for about $2.5 billion.
   May 17 _ On the eve of its annual meeting, Macmillan Inc. says it
has received an unsolicited takeover proposal of $64-a-share from a
group led by the Texan Robert M. Bass, who already owns a 9 percent
stake in the company.
   May 18 _ Macmillan Chairman Edward P. Evans tells shareholders
that the company is not for sale, but takes no immediate position on
the Bass offer.
   May 31 _ Macmillan's board proposes a restructuring plan that
would split the company into two companies, publishing and
information services, and give shareholders a stake in each as well
as a cash dividend of $52.35 a share.
   June 4 _ The Bass Group boosts its offer to $73 a share or, as an
alternative, a restructuring that was the same as the company had
proposed except that the cash dividend would be $58 a share.
   June 8 _ Macmillan rejects the Bass Group's proposals to pay $73
a share for the company or participate in its restructuring plan.
   June 10 _ A Delaware Chancery Court judge, acting on a suit filed
by the Bass Group, temporarily blocks Macmillan from proceeding with
its restructuring plan.
   July 14 _ The Delaware Chancery Court judge issues an injunction
against the Macmillan restructuring plan, and the company says it
would appeal.
   July 17 _ The Bass Group sweetens its buyout offer to $75 a
share, and launchs a tender offer.
   July 21 _ Macmillan says it received an unsolicited proposal from
British publisher Robert Maxwell to acquire the company at $80 a
share.
   July 29 _ Macmillan's board rejects the Bass' $75 a share offer,
but authorizes management to explore other transactions.
   Aug. 12 _ Maxwell tells Macmillan he plans to launch a tender
offer at $80 a share, but offers to drop it if the company sells him
the information services company it planned to create for not less
than $1.1 billion.
   Aug. 26 _ Macmillan's board rejects Maxwell's offer as inadequate.
   Sept. 9 _ Maxwell says his company may increase its $80-a-share
bid, or pay $1.4 billion for specified information services
businesses alone.
   Sept. 12 _ Macmillan announces it agreed to a buyout by a group
including the investment banking firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
and Macmillan senior management for $85 a share in cash and
securities.
   Sept. 15 _ Maxwell boosts his offer to $86.80 a share in cash.
   Sept. 16 _ Kohlberg Kravis launches its tender offer. The Bass
Group drops its $75 a share offer.
   Sept. 27 _ After an auction, Macmillan agrees to a bid of $90.05
a share cash and securities by Kohlberg Kravis, snubbing a sweetened
$89 a share cash offer by Maxwell. It also gives Kohlberg Kravis the
right to buy four of its businesses for $865 million should their
merger agreement collapse.
   Sept. 29 _ Maxwell sweetens his bid to $90.25 a share in cash,
and says he would pay $900 million for the same four businesses.
   Oct. 5 _ Macmillan's board recommends that shareholders reject
Maxwell's latest bid because it contains conditions that would
include invalidating the lockup provision on selling four businesses
to Kohlberg Kravis.
   Oct. 17 _ The Delaware Chancery Court denies Maxwell's request
that it throw out the Macmillan's lockup agreement with Kohlberg.
   Nov. 2 _ The Delaware Supreme Court reverses the lower court and
effectively blocks the merger agreement between Macmillan and
Kohlberg, calling the bidding process ``tainted.''
   Nov. 3 _ The Macmillan board throws its support to the Maxwell
tender offer, and Kohlberg drops its tender offer.

<TEXT>
   West Point-Pepperell Inc. has taken the offensive
in its battle to thwart a takeover by Farley Inc., seeking a federal
court order blocking the $1.4 billion offer.
   Pepperell filed suit in federal court in Georgia seeking to stop
Farley's $48-per-share offer, on the grounds that the company is
financially unable to go through with its offer and that its
financial partner, the investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
legally can not participate in the deal.
   In papers filed Thursday with the Securities and Exchange
Commission in Washington, Pepperell claimed Drexel was violating
terms of March 3 standstill agreement with Pepperell.
   The agreement prohibits Drexel from ``assisting anyone in
acquiring, directly or indirectly, (J.P.) Stevens (& Co. Inc.) or
its business assets for a term of one year,'' the filing stated.
   Earlier this year, Drexel advised the investor group Odyssey
Partners during its efforts to buy Stevens. Pepperell and Odyssey
eventually jointly acquired the company, with Pepperell retaining
Stevens' bed and bath textile operations.
   ``We were never a party to any standstill agreement, and in our
opinion, the suit is totally lacking in merit,'' said Drexel
spokesman Steven Anreder in New York.
   Jack Albertine, a Farley spokesman in Chicago, said the company
would have no comment until it had studied the allegations.
   The SEC filing also alleged that Farley's offer violates Federal
Reserve Bank regulations because of the amount of debt involved and
says Drexel has failed to identify itself as a ``bidder'' under
security regulations and has not filed necessary documents.
   Also Thursday, West Point said it had delayed until Nov. 15
enacting its ``poison pill'' provisions which grant shareholders
special rights in the event of a takeover bid. Separate trading in
the rights had been scheduled to begin Thursday.
   Thursday's filing with the SEC repeated Pepperell's contention
that Farley's offer ``does not reflect the long-term value
achievable by the company as an independent entity.''
   Pepperell's board on Wednesday said Farley was trying to purchase
the company before its stock price reflected the full value of the
Stevens acquisition.
   The Stevens assets must be held separately until early December
under an agreement with the Federal Trade Commission, company
officials have said.
   Pepperell stock fell $1.37{ to $43.87{ a share Thursday in
composite New York Stock Exchange trading, following a 25-cent a
share drop on Wednesday.
   Also Wednesday, the Pepperell board authorized management to
explore other alternatives for the company, a possible sale of the
company or some of its businesses to a third party.
   ``The company is not currently engaged in negotiations with any
third parties with respect to any such transaction, although it may
commence such negotiations at any time,'' the company's SEC filing
said.
   The company said it would have no statement on any such
negotiation until or if they were completed.
   Pepperell manufactures Arrow shirts and Martex towels, and as a
result of the Stevens acquisition has about 25 percent of the
nation's home fashion textile market.
   Subsidiaries of Farley, a privately owned conglomerate headed by
William Farley, manufacture Fruit of the Loom underwear and Acme
boots.
   Farley notified Pepperell in May it was seeking up to 25 percent
of Pepperell's 29.4 million outstanding shares and, as of last week,
had spent $88 million for 9.8 percent of the stock.

<HEAD>Pioneer Seed Corn Prices Rise An Average 11.8 Percent, Drought
Blamed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN P. ROSENFELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The impact of last summer's drought has
come home again for corn farmers, with the world's largest seed corn
producer announcing a double-digit price hike for 1989 sales to
farmers.
   Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc. said Thursday the average
increase of 11.8 percent, which it said was mandated by higher
production costs, would come to about $7.39 a bag, something that
would bring the cost of an average bag of corn to about $70.
   But because the company sells a wide variety of seed, some
farmers still will pay less than $70 and some will pay more.
   An executive said the price announcement Thursday should relieve
farmer fears of an even steeper hike in seed costs for next spring's
planting.
   ``This should be good news to those who've heard rumors that
Pioneer seed corn would be selling for well over $100 a bag,''
Charles S. Johnson, senior vice president for the company's North
American operations, said in a prepared statement.
   Based on the average increase announced, a farmer would spend
about $220 more next spring than last for each 100 acres planted if
he used a Pioneer variety that is designed to seed 3.4 acres per bag.
   Pioneer seed corn is sold in packages ranging from 60,000 kernels
a bag to 110,000 kernels, and the company said most increases will
range from $5 to $10 a bag.
   ``The reason for the increase is very heavily related to the
drought,'' Pioneer spokesman Dave Knau said in an interview.
   The blistering summer of 1988 shriveled Pioneer's harvest of corn
grown for farm seed to little more than half of what it had planned
to grow, Knau said. As a result, the company had to plan expensive
winter production _ half of it spread through the states of Arizona,
California, Florida and Texas and half in the South American
countries of Argentina and Chile.
   But he said Pioneer believes the increase will be curbed somewhat
because the outlook for the winter harvest is good and because it
was able to carry over unsold seed corn from previous harvests
equivalent to 57 percent of last spring's sales.
   Johnson said the company is projecting that nearly one-fourth of
its supply for next spring will be in five new hybrids that
``demonstrated a strong performance advantage over the competition
this past growing season, even with the drought.'' Those hybrids are
designated 3751, 3585, 3379, 3343 and 3140.
   Meantime, Pioneer and others are forecasting stepped up sales for
1989 plantings because the government, in response to drought damage
suffered by farmers, will not require corn growers to leave as much
land idle as they did this year to qualify for federal subsidies.
   Knau said the prices for 1989 seed were announced a few weeks
later than usual because company officials had to factor in winter
production. He also said the company may slightly reduce 1989
spending on advertising or on premium giveaways to promote sales,
such as caps and jackets.
   But he said the company will continue offering discounts of 1
percent to 14 percent based on the dollar volume of sales and
discounts ranging from 2 percent to 7 percent for orders paid for in
advance.

<HEAD>October Auto Sales Up From Weak, Year-Earlier Month</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Automakers sold 8 percent more cars and light
trucks in the United States last month than in October 1987, partly
because of the stock market crash and partly because of lighter than
normal sales in the year-earlier month.
   U.S. and foreign automakers on Thursday reported selling
1,215,402 vehicles during October of this year, compared with
1,169,067 a year earlier. The percentage change is based on daily
sales rates, because there were 26 sales days in October this year
and 27 during the month last year.
   Weak sales of foreign-made cars and light trucks were more than
offset in October by strong sales of U.S.-made cars and especially
tucks.
   Auto sales, like the rest of the economy, slowed immediately
after the Oct. 19, 1987, stock market crash as consumers held off on
big-ticket purchases. But over time, the crash proved to have little
if any effect on car sales. The 1988 model year ended Sept. 30 was
the third-best on record.
   Also coloring sales comparisons were consumers' reactions to
dealer incentives.
   During August and September 1987, automakers offered big cash
rebates or low financing to lure buyers into showrooms. But those
incentives ended Sept. 30, 1987, and some consumers who planned to
buy cars in October accelerated their plans to take advantage of the
deals.
   The effects of the crash and lackluster buying last year were
most noticeable in comparing sales during the Oct. 21-31 period with
the entire month for both years.
   In late October, General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and
Chrysler Corp. reported car sales rose 6.1 percent, on a daily
basis, with a total of 187,249 sold during the period this year and
196,015 during the same time last year.
   But for the month, which takes into account sales before the
crash, sales for the Big Three jumped 17.5 percent, to 542,373 cars
last month from 479,176 in October last year.
   ``Consumers essentially sat out the latter part of October and
early November (last year) in everything, not just autos,'' said
auto analyst Jeannette Garretty of the Bank of America in San
Francisco.
   Tom Webb, a senior economist with the National Automobile Dealers
Association outside Washington, said the sales swings resulted less
from the crash than from depressed purchasing during October of last
year, compared with the same month this year.
   ``Last year's real depressed sales during the 10-day period was
more of a payback,'' he said, from accelerated buying in August and
September of 1987. But he acknowledged that the crash damaged
consumer confidence for a short time.
   During late October, U.S. automakes sold 7.9 percent more cars
and light trucks compared with the same period last year.
   Domestic manufacturers sold 334,237 cars and light trucks,
compared with 344,190 during the same time last year. The comparison
is based on a daily selling rate, and there were nine selling days
in this year's period and 10 last year.
   Ford reported that during late October, it sold 61,883 cars, up
15.6 percent from the 59,502 cars it sold during the sae period in
1987. The nation's No. 2 automaker said its monthly sales rose 29.3
percent to 179,903 cars last month from 144,499 during October last
year.
   Chrysler's sales went to 30,538 cars during late October this
year, compared with 32,736 last year, a 3.7 percent gain based on
the number of cars sold per sales day. And for the month, Chrysler
said it sold 84,373 cars this year, 13.3 percent more than the
77,359 it sold in October 1987.
   GM said it sold 94,828 cars in late October this year, up, on a
daily sales basis, 1.5 percent from the 103,777 cars the nation's
No. 1 automaker sold during the same period last year. In October,
GM has sold 278,097 cars, 12.2 percent more than the 257,318 cars it
sold during October 1987.

   Here are sales results for the seven major U.S.
automakers for Oct. 21-31.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals. There
were nine selling days in the period this year and 10 last year. For
the month, there were 26 selling days this year and 27 last year.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota and Mazda are counted as domestic. Mazda began manufacturing
cars at its Flat Rock, Mich., plant in October 1987.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and Chrysler
names are counted as foreign.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises, Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar rose against most major currencies
this morning in moderate European trading as the market cautiously
eyed the upcoming U.S. presidential election.
   Gold prices drifted lower as a rally in platinum, caused by tight
supplies, lost momentum and as the dollar remained steady.
   Foreign exchange dealers predicted the dollar would rise ahead of
the U.S. balloting next Tuesday, although it would trade in a narrow
range.
   ``The market is very cautious right now,'' said a dealer at a
major West German bank in Frankfurt. ``People are liquidating
exposure on the downside, fearing the market might turn around and
head higher before Tuesday is over.''
   But dealers said market players agreed the dollar is bound to
decline after the elections.
   In London, the dollar strengthened against the British pound. It
cost $1.7783 to buy one pound, cheaper for buyers than $1.7805 late
Thursday.
   Other mid-morning dollar rates in Europe compared with late
Thursday's prices, included: 1.7820 West German marks, up from
1.7760; 1.4920 Swiss francs, up from 1.4863; 6.0830 French francs,
up from 6.0565; 2.0098 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9990; 1,325.00
Italian lire, up from 1,317.50; and 1.2220 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.2234.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 124.63 yen, down 0.05 yen from
Wednesday's close. Japanese markets were closed Thursday for a
national holiday. In London, the dollar was trading Friday at 124.45
yen.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $422.25 a troy ounce,
unchanged from the late bid price Thursday. At mid-morning, London's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $419.50.
   In Zurich, the metal fell to $419.60 bid from $421.85 bid late
Thursday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid $421.86, down from
$422.99 bid at Thursday's close.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid of $6.40 a troy
ounce, down from $6.51 bid late Thursday.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar edged down today against the
Japanese yen, while prices fell moderately on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The dollar closed the week at 124.63 yen, down 0.05 yen from
Wednesday's closing. After opening at 124.72 yen, the U.S. currency
moved between 124.60 and 124.85 yen during the day.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which declined
28.41 points Wednesday, shed another 32.01 points, or 0.11 percent,
to finish at 27,953.25.
   Traders said the Bank of Japan stepped into the market this
morning, buying 30 million to 50 million dollars when the U.S.
currency was trading at about 124.80-124.85 yen.
   But today's central bank action, the fourth such intervention
this week, was ineffective in triggering a dollar rally, with the
U.S. currency continuing to trade around pre-intervention levels.
   The Bank of Japan does not publicly comment on its market
interventions.
   Traders said market participants were awaiting the release of
U.S. employment figures for October, due later Friday.
   Stock and foreign exchange markets in Tokyo were closed Thursday
for Culture Day, a Japanese national holiday.

<HEAD>Pillsbury Silent After Board Meeting</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Lead prospects uncertain.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pillsbury Co.'s board of directors held an
all-day meeting, but the food and restaurant giant was silent about
how it would counter a $5.23 billion takeover bid from Britain's
Grand Metropolitan PLC.
   Johnny Thompson, vice president of public relations, would not
disclose where the board met for its regularly scheduled meeting
Thursday, but said at 5:30 p.m. it had adjourned.
   On Oct. 17, Pillsbury's board rejected as inadequate Grand Met's
$60-a-share, all-cash tender offer, but the food company has not
offered shareholders an alternative and has not met with Grand Met
officials to discuss the offer, which its suitor has said is
negotiable.
   Pillsbury Chairman Philip Smith said Oct. 18 an alternative to
the tender offer would be announced before shareholders are required
to decide whether to sell to Grand Met. The offer expires Tuesday,
but Grand Met could extend the offer for a second time. The original
expiration date was Nov. 1.
   Some analysts and investors said the company planned to announce
a recapitalization plan today to try to beat Grand Met's offer, or
prompt the British company to increase its price.
   Grand Met, a British distiller and consumer products company,
intends to start buying Pillsbury shares Tuesday.
   ``I expect to hear them coming out with a plan to shareholders
(Friday),'' said Stephen Carnes of Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood Inc.
Pillsbury management told shareholders they'll give them adequate
time to decide between Grand Met's offer and whatever plan Pillsbury
develops, Carnes said.
   Pillsbury's stock dropped 62{ cents Thursday to close at $60.82{
per share on the New York Stock Exchange, as speculators continued
to anticipate a richer offer. The stock was selling for about $37
per share before Grand Met made its offer.
   Pillsbury and its four New York investment bankers have been
talking to bankers, other potential financiers and other parties
about possible deals.
   ``I think that's why we haven't heard anything,'' said Craig
Carver of Dain Bosworth Inc. ``If four of the Wall Street wizards
can't come up with something, there ain't nothing.''
   Smith has said management was instructed by the board to pursue
alternatives including a dividend to shareholders, a leveraged
buyout, or the acquisition of Pillsbury by a third party. In a
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Pillsbury also
said it would consider buying shares of Grand Met stock as a defense
against the takeover bid, which was launched Oct. 4.
   A group of dissident shareholders is suing to force Pillsbury to
negotiate the tender offer with Grand Met or come up with an
alternative of equal or greater value.
   Hennepin County District Court Judge Thomas Carey on Wednesday
granted a request by the dissident group that all shareholders of
record as of Oct. 17 be represented as a class in the lawsuit.

   Overall sales again were sluggish in October for the nation's
largest general retailers, but apparel lines continued the recovery
they began in September.
   ``Sales for the month were good _ obviously it was led by
apparel,'' said Monroe H. Greenstein, a retail industry analyst with
the investment firm Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc.
   However, Greenstein said Thursday, October's results looked
better than they really were because they were being compared
against the very weak sales of October 1987.
   Jeffrey Feiner, a Merrill Lynch & Co. analyst, said, ``We still
characterize the overall retail environment as somewhat sluggish and
don't expect any significant improvement going into this important
Christmas selling season.''
   But Walter Loeb of Morgan Stanley & Co., saw cause for optimism.
   ``I don't see any reason to compare (the sales) with last year,''
because most of the weakness in October 1987 came in the week
following the stock market crash, he said.
   ``I think Christmas will be quite substantial,'' Loeb said.
   Analysts and retailers reported improvement in apparel sales,
which have been in a slump since August of last year because of
customer reluctance to buy shorter skirts and clothes they felt were
boring. Clothing sales had shown some signs of life in September,
boosting hopes that a recovery finally was under way.
   Limited Inc., a leading specialty apparel retailer, reported its
overall October sales rose 20 percent while sales at stores open at
least a year _ known as same-store sales _ rose 15 percent.
   ``We're starting to see some pickup at the rest'' of the apparel
retailers, said Fred Wintzer, an analyst with Alex. Brown & Sons
Inc. in Baltimore.
   Beyond fashion troubles, retailers in general have suffered
through sluggish sales for more than a year and a half as consumers
paid more for necessities and services and tried to pay down their
high debt levels.
   Several retailers again reported sales gains well under the rate
of inflation, which has increased by 4.5 percent so far this year.
   The nation's largest retailer, Sears, Roebuck and Co., which
earlier this week announced a restructuring and overhaul of its
selling strategy, said its overall sales were up 7.5 percent last
month and 5.9 percent for the first 39 weeks of the fiscal year.
Sears' same-store sales rose 2.5 percent in October and 2 percent
for the year so far.
   Retailers and industry analysts believe same-store sales are a
more accurate yardstick of a company's performance than figures that
include sales from new stores. But not all retailers report both
overall and same-store results.
   K mart Corp. said its overall sales rose 5.8 percent in October
and 5.7 percent for the first 39 weeks of the year. The company's
same-store sales rose 1.8 for the month and 2 percent for the year
to date.
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. reported its overall sales were up 24
percent last month and 29 percent so far this year. Its same-store
sales were up 9 percent for the month and 11 percent for the year to
date.
   J.C. Penney Co. Inc. said its overall sales rose 8.1 percent last
month, and 0.4 percent for the year so far. Its same-store sales
were up 6.9 percent in October, but fell 0.7 percent over the 39
weeks.
   Dayton Hudson Corp. said its overall sales rose 8.8 percent last
month, and 16 percent for the 39-week period. Same-store sales were
up 1 percent in October and 1.7 percent for the year to date.
   May Department Stores Co. reported a 22.8 percent jump in overall
sales in October and a 15.4 percent rise so far this year. May's
same-store sales were up 3.7 percent last month and 1.8 percent for
the year to date.
   Montgomery Ward & Co. reported a 3.2 percent rise in October
sales, and a 3.1 pickup during the 39-week period.
   F.W. Woolworth Co. said its overall October sales rose 11.7
percent, while year-to-date sales improved 12.1 percent. Woolworth's
same-store sales were up 5.7 percent for the month, and 5.9 percent
so far this year.
   The results reported Thursday were from the biggest general
merchandise and apparel retailers. Unlike monthly retail sales
figures released by the federal government, they do not include
sales at auto dealers, supermarkets or restaurants.

<HEAD>With PM-Computer Virus, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Just as a biological virus disrupts living cells to cause
disease, a computer virus invades data processors and disrupts
normal operation of the machines.
   Biological viruses are pieces of the hereditary code that take
over a cell's machinery to trick it into making thousands of
duplicates of the original virus that spread from cell to cell.
Viruses cause diseases such as AIDS.
   In a similar fashion, a computer virus is a computer program that
carries in its code instructions for replicating itself perfectly.
   Once it invades a computer, the virus temporarily takes control
of the operating system, which is the master program that allows the
computer to run other programs, such as word-processing software.
   The virus spreads into other programs in the computer and spreads
from one computer to the next as users give each other floppy disks
or link up over telephone lines.
   Some viruses are created by pranksters and do no more than
deliver a message to an unsuspecting user. Others can wipe out
stored data and slow or damage a computer's hardware.

<TEXT>
   A proposed $1.9 billion merger between San Diego
Gas & Electric Co. and Tucson Electric Power Co. was called off ``in
the best interests of the respective companies,'' the utilities
announced jointly.
   Officials from both firms said Thursday the deal was terminated
because they could not agree on an approach to defeat efforts by
Southern California Edison Corp. to block the merger.
   SCE, a holding company for the Southern California Edison Co.
utility, made a $2.2 billion hostile bid for SDG&E last month. The
offer was contingent on the San Diego utility not acquiring the
Arizona utility.
   ``These issues led the boards of directors of TEP and SDG&E to
conclude that it was in the best interests of the respective
companies and their stockholders, employees and customers to
terminate the merger agreement,'' SDG&E spokesman Fred Vaughn said.
   Under the terminated agreement, SDG&E and TEP would have
exchanged stock, leaving SDG&E the surviving company.

   The stock market was sharply lower in early
trading today, pressured by new unemployment data that showed
surprising strength in the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 14.58 points at
2,155.76 after a half-hour of trading at 10 a.m. EST.
   Declining issues outpaced advancing ones by around 4 to 1 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 804 issues down, 185 up and 458
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 21.01 million shares.
   The government reported today that the nation's civilian
unemployment rate fell to 5.3 percent in October as the economy
created more than 300,000 jobs.
   The unexpectedly low jobless rate fueled concern that the economy
could be heating up, and the Federal Reserve could move to rein in
inflation by nudging interest rates higher.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks had
fallen 0.79 to 156.29.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was down
1.23 at 298.57.
   On Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 13.51 points

<HEAD>Market Not Expected to Fete Bush Victory</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wall Street already has cast its vote: for George
Bush.
   But the anticipated victory of its favored candidate doesn't seem
likely to set off any raucous celebrations in the stock market. In
fact, many analysts say, a Bush win in Tuesday's presidential
election could bring a mild downturn on Wednesday.
   The market has been anticipating a Bush victory for quite some
time now, and has calculated that event into its thinking. That sets
up a classic case of ``buy the rumor, then sell the fact'' after the
election if the vice president wins.
   ``What's factored into the market is that Bush will win,'' said
Monte Gordon, vice president and director of research at Dreyfus
Corp.
   Investors who bought stocks earlier on the assumption of a
Republican victory will sell and take their profits on post-election
Wednesday, under this scenario.
   In addition, the market could be hit by the realization that Bush
``isn't going to create a miracle in 24 hours and the economy's
still got problems,'' suggested Bill Raftery, a stock analyst for
Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   The sell-off isn't expected to be massive, and some market
watchers even anticipate a rally.
   In the event that Michael Dukakis wins, on the other hand, the
market could be shaken more severely.
   Wall Street sees Dukakis, among other things, as a big-spending
liberal Democrat and someone who would be prone to raise taxes _ one
of the market's biggest bugaboos.
   ``The investment community views Bush as an extension of Reagan,
and Reagan was considered healthy for the market,'' said Philip
Puccio, a senior vice president at Dillon, Read & Co.
   A Dukakis White House, by contrast, would be expected to pursue
economic policies similar to those of the Carter administration,
Puccio added. Wall Street was no fan of Jimmy Carter.
   While it sees Bush as a safe bet, the market doesn't believe he
has the election completely sewn up. That's why trading stalled last
week and volume on the New York Stock Exchange slowed to a trickle
amid uncertainty ahead of the election.
   You don't have to scratch hard to find pre-election jitters under
the market's surface.
   On Oct. 19, the one-year anniversary of last year's stock
collapse, the market was knocked off a post-crash high by a rumor
that the Washington Post was about to publish a story potentially
damaging to Bush's campaign. The Post denied it. But traders who had
made profits in the market's earlier rise were primed to sell, and
they did.
   The market dislikes uncertainty _ almost as much as it hates
taxes.

   The stock market was recovering in early trading
today, after a sharply lower start sparked by new unemployment data.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 4.44 points at
2,165.90 at 11 a.m. EST. The blue-chip indicator had lost more than
14 points an hour earlier.
   Declining issues edged out advancing ones by around 7 to 4 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 694 issues down, 438 up and 580
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 46.72 million shares.
   The government reported today that the nation's civilian
unemployment rate fell to 5.3 percent in October as the economy
created more than 300,000 jobs.
   The unexpectedly low jobless rate fueled concern that the economy
could be heating up, and the Federal Reserve could move to rein in
inflation by nudging interest rates higher.
   ``It was a negative surprise,'' said Michael Metz, an analyst for
Oppenheimer & Co. ``I think the market is on the defensive right
here.''
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks had
fallen 0.28 to 156.80.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was down
1.25 at 298.55.

   Soybean futures prices surged at today's opening
on the Chicago Board of Trade on news of a large, unexpected export
sale of soybeans and soybean meal, but later turned mixed.
   Grain futures also opened higher but then turned mostly lower in
early trading.
   The markets were surprised by the Agriculture Department's
announcement late Thursday that the Soviet Union had purchased
535,000 metric tons of U.S. soybeans and that another 540,000 metric
tons of soybeans and soymeal had been sold to undisclosed
destinations, analysts said.
   Rumors of such large export sales usually reach the futures
markets before the sales are officially confirmed.
   ``We didn't see a whole lot of commercial trade yesterday and in
light of that, it was somewhat surprising to see this type of deal
made,'' said Walter Spilka, grain market analyst with Smith Barney,
Harris Upham & Co. in New York.
   Trading activity was much lighter in the grain markets, where
there was little news to sway prices, he said.
   In early trading, wheat was 2\ cents lower to 1 cent higher with
the contract for delivery in December at $4.14} a bushel; corn was
1\ cents to 2} cents lower with December at $2.79} a bushel; oats
were 1\ cents to 2 cents lower with December at $2.20 a bushel;
soybeans were 1} cents lower to 2 cents higher with November at

   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .10 cent higher with December at
72.85 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .15 cent
higher with November at 81.35 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent
lower to .28 cent higher with December at 41.17 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .10 cent lower to .18 cent higher with
February at 45.65 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled sharply lower on Thursday.

   Researchers today tried to trace a ``virus'' that infected
computer systems nationwide, slowing machines in universities, a
NASA and nuclear weapons lab and other federal research centers
linked by a Defense Department computer network.
   By Thursday night, the virus had infected hundreds of computers
on what one expert said was the largest scale ever. Authorities said
the virus apparently destroyed no data but temporarily halted some
research.
   The New York Times reported today that an anonymous caller to the
newspaper claimed that a graduate student had created the virus as a
harmless experiment and became terrified of the consequences when it
got out of hand.
   Viruses are tiny programs introduced to computers either as a
prank or vandalism. They can attach themselves to other programs and
spread through shared software or ``electronic mail'' systems that
link computers.
   Mild viruses may flash a message on a user's screen, while
``deadly'' forms can destroy data or cripple a computer. This virus
apparently did its damage by rapidly duplicating itself, thereby
slowing computers' processing speed and taking up their memory space.
   Many research centers shut down their computers Thursday in an
effort to purge the rapidly spreading virus, but not all experts
were confident they had eliminated the program, which could linger
in electronic mailboxes. In the past, ``antidote'' programs have
been developed to seek out and destroy viruses.
   ``The very scary thing is that this is a very sophisticated
computer program, and shutting them down may not be enough,'' said
Richard LeBlanc, associate professor in Georgia Tech's School of
Computer Sciences.
   At Lawrence laboratory in Berkeley, Calif., computer scientists
noticed their computers operating very slowly Wednesday afternoon.
   They turned off the machines, flipped them back on again and
within 30 seconds the virus was spreading again, said Lynn Yarras, a
spokesman at the research center.
   The computer problem also was discovered late Wednesday at the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, Calif. The
laboratory's work includes design of the nation's nuclear weapons
and key work on the Strategic Defense Initiative, or ``Star Wars,''
program.
   However, spokesman Jeff Garberson said the virus affected the
unclassified, non-secured computer systems and not the classified
national defense system.
   At the Los Alamos, N.M., National Laboratory, the virus infected
only unclassified computers, said spokeswoman Barbara Mulkin.
   Computer experts at the lab were analyzing the situation to
determine what damage might have occurred and to find a cure. Ms.
Mulkin said that might take a day.
   At Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif., the virus was
``mainly just slowing down systems and slowing data,'' said Bob
Beyers, a school spokesman.
   ``The developer was clearly a very high order hacker,'' or
computer buff, said John McAfee, chairman of the Computer Virus
Industry Association in Santa Clara, Calif.
   ``He used a flaw in the operating systems of these computers'' to
enter the electronic mail system of ARPANET, a computer network
established by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the
research arm of the U.S. Defense Department, McAfee said.
   ARPANET links nearly every university in the United States,
allowing researchers to ``communicate data and text very easily,''
said Bob Finn, a spokesman for the California Institute of
Technology.
   The virus also infected a network called Science Internet that
serves many scientists and research labs, including NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said JPL spokesman Jim
Wilson.
   Also attacked were computers at Harvard University, Boston
University, Purdue University, the University of Wisconsin in
Madison, Georgia Tech, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
other major research centers.
   The Times reported today that the anonymous caller to the paper
said his associate was responsible for the attack and had meant it
to be harmless. The caller said the hacker was a graduate student
who made a programming error in designing the virus, causing the
program to replicate much faster than expected.
   The caller said the student realized his error shortly after
letting the program loose and now was terrified of the consequences,
the Times said.
   The Defense Communications Agency set up an emergency center to
deal with the virus, the newspaper said. But no known criminal
investigations were under way.
   In September, a former Fort Worth, Texas, programmer was
convicted of planting a virus in his employer's computer system in
the first such conviction in the nation. Two days after the employee
was fired, the virus activated, erasing 168,000 company records.
   Charley Kline, senior research programer at the University of
Illinois, said Thursday's virus traveled between computer systems
through a process in which computer operators usually send
electronic mail to each other.
   He said once the messages were received, their coding told the
computer to make copies of the virus. The copies then sought out
other connected computers, he said.
   ``This is the first time that I know of that it has happened on
this scale to larger systems,'' said Kline.
   Whether the virus ultimately would have destroyed computer data
won't be known until its program is more thoroughly studied, McAfee
said.
   In 1986 and 1987, two brothers in Pakistan who sold inexpensive
copies of computer software let loose a virus known as the Pakistani
Brain through surreptitious coding in the software.
   ``It eventually was found in every country in the world, every
state in the union, every university computer,'' McAfee said.
   At Boston University, Associate Provost John Porter called
computer viruses ``electronic vandalism.''
   ``It's childish and infantile, done with no knowledge of the
results,'' Porter said.

<TEXT>
   British publisher Robert Maxwell's persistence in
pursuing Macmillan Inc. has paid off, and with his success has come
another big buyout of a U.S. media company by foreign-controlled
interests.
   The publishing and information services giant, which spurned
Maxwell's advances repeatedly since mid-July, gave in Thursday and
threw its support behind his latest $2.51 billion takeover offer.
   The move paved the way for Maxwell's completion of his tender
offer.
   Maxwell's tender offer of $90.25 cash a share expired at midnight
Thursday, and he said today that about 27.5 million of Macmillan's
29 million fully-diluted shares were tendered.
   In London today, his Maxwell Communication Corp. PLC said it
planned a restructuring to focus more on publishing and less on
printing following its takeover of Macmillan.
   Maxwell Communication said in a statement that it plans to sell
BPCC, Britain's largest commercial printing business, perhaps to its
management. In addition, Maxwell Communication said it is
considering selling its newspaper printing business.
   Maxwell is to retain his privately held Mirror Group Newspapers,
which owns the national Daily Mirror.
   ``These moves represent a major strategic refocusing of our
businesses in the publishing arena on both sides of the Atlantic,''
said Maxwell, who serves as chairman of Maxwell Communication.
   Macmillan shares closed at $90.12{ a share Thursday, up 62{ cents
in New York Stock Exchange trading.
   Maxwell's acquisition is the latest example of the importance
that European publishing companies have placed on getting into the
lucrative American market.
   For Maxwell, it is his biggest step yet toward his often-repeated
goal of creating a global communications powerhouse.
   The Macmillan board's change of heart came one day after the
Delaware Supreme Court effectively blocked it from proceeding with
an agreement to sell the company to an investment group led by the
buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and Macmillan's senior
management.
   In a terse, midafternoon announcement, Macmillan said its board
had determined the Maxwell offer was ``in the best interest of all
shareholders'' and recommended that they tender their shares.
   The board also said its poison-pill defense against the Maxwell
offer was inapplicable.
   Shortly therafter, Kohlberg Kravis said it was dropping its
tender offer of $90.05 a share in cash and securities and wished
Maxwell and Macmillan well.
   Macmillan became a takeover target in mid-May when a group led by
the wealthy Texan Robert M. Bass proposed a $64-a-share buyout. The
company's shares were trading at about $50 a share at the time.
   Maxwell joined the fray in mid-July and had been embroiled since
mid-September in a bidding war with Kohlberg Kravis.
   Maxwell's top financial adviser, Robert S. Pirie of Rothschild
Inc., said earlier he was confident Maxwell would get sufficient
shares to secure control of the company.
   He said the Bass group had advised him it planned to tender to
Maxwell its 2.5 million shares, which is about 9 percent of
Macmillan's shares.
   The Bass group was believed to have acquired its stake for about
$60 a share, giving it a $75 million profit on the investment before
expenses.
   The takeover fight included a series of rancorous courtroom
battles, but Wednesday's action by the Delaware Supreme Court gave
Maxwell the edge.
   The court ruled Macmillan management had unfairly tipped Kohlberg
Kravis about Maxwell's latest offer during a bidding auction in late
September, enabling Kohlberg Kravis to submit a higher bid and
obtain an option to buy four key Macmillan operations for $865
million if the merger fell through.
   The court called for an injunction against the Macmillan merger
agreement with Kohlberg Kravis and its ``lockup'' provision on the
sale of the four businesses.
   Bert Boksen, who follows the publishing business for Raymond
James Financial Corp. in St. Petersburg, Fla., said Maxwell's buyout
effort amounted to the ``the first successful hostile takeover of a
domestic publishing operation.''
   Among recent acquisitions were the $3 billion acquisition of TV
Guide publisher Triangle Publications Inc. by Rupert Murdoch's News
Corp.; Pearson PLC's $283 million buyout of Addison-Wesley
Publishing Co.; and Hachette SA's $450 million takeover of Grolier
Inc.
   Maxwell has frequently stated his intention of making Maxwell
Communication Corp. PLC into a global communications giant. The
London-based company had revenue of about $1.5 billion last year.
   He was thwarted two years ago in an effort to acquire Harcourt
Brace Jovanovich Inc., a Florida-based textbook publisher that
underwent a costly recapitalization plan to thwart him.
   Maxwell is the second largest U.S. printer, and announced plans
last week to buy the airline guides operation of the Dun &
Bradstreet Corp. for $750 million.
   Macmillan earned $70.7 million on revenue of $955.8 million in
1987.
   Its publishing operations accounted for about 46 percent of its
sales and 41 percent of its operating income in 1987, while
information services such as legal databases and directories
comprised 24 percent of sales and 40 percent of operating income.
   The remainder comes from instructional, reference and retail
operations.

<HEAD>Texas Air Posts $114.1 Million Loss in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Air Corp. reported Friday a net loss of
$114.1 million during a third quarter that traditionally is strong.
   The nation's largest airline company said its loss in the three
months ended Sept. 30 widened from the $72.8 million it lost in the
third quarter of 1987.
   Third-quarter revenue declined to $2.13 billion from $2.20
billion a year earlier.
   Texas Air is the parent of Continental Airlines and financially
troubled Eastern Airlines. It recently agreed to sell Eastern's
profitable shuttle service to developer Donald Trump for $365
million in cash.
   Houston-based Continental posted a third-quarter profit of $15.2
million, compared with a net loss of $10.2 million a year earlier.
Its revenue for the quarter rose to $1.2 billion from $1.1 billion.
   ``Continental's modest profit signals that financial progress
continues to be made at the company. However, in view of the fact
that the quarter is traditionally one of the company's strongest,
the results are clearly unsatisfactory,'' Texas Air said in a
statement.
   Miami-based Eastern had a net loss of $112.9 million before a
$12.3 million charge for dividends payable to holders of its
preferred shares. That was widened from a loss of $67.4 million,
before a $14 million charge for preferred dividends, a year earlier.
   Eastern's third-quarter revenue declined to $912.7 million from
$1.1 billion.
   ``Eastern's results reflect its labor situation as well as severe
competitive pressures on the revenue side,'' Texas Air said.
``However, Eastern also is showing marked operational improvement,
as indicated by Department of Transportation statistics, which is a
tribute to the outstanding performance of Eastern's employees during
this difficult period.''
   Eastern has been locked in a prolonged bitter battle with its
unions.
   In the first nine months of the year, Texas Air had a net loss of
$494.3 million, widened from a loss of $200.5 million in the same
period of 1987.
   Texas Air's nine-month revenue was unchanged at $6.4 billion.
   Continental's results for the first nine months amounted to a net
loss of $216.3 million, including an adjustment of $131 million in
the second quarter related to its air traffic liability account.
That compares with the first nine months of 1987, when Continental
had a net loss of $179.2 million.
   Nine-month revenue for Continental jumped to $3.4 billion from
$2.9 billion.
   For the same period, Eastern lost $233.7 million, widened from a
loss of $38.2 million a year earlier. Its nine-month revenue fell to
$3.0 billion from $3.4 billion.
   Eastern also announced that it will not renew its contingency
pilot and flight attendant replacement training program with
Continental. Eastern officials said there are no plans to resume the
program, which expires this month, in light of expectations that a
work stoppage is considered unlikely.

<TEXT>
   Share prices finished lower on London's Stock
Exchange Friday, as the release of stronger-than-expected U.S.
unemployment figures curbed the market's earlier gains.
   The London market followed Wall Street downward after the release
of the report. It also followed Wall Street back up, when New York
staged a partial recovery.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed down
3.3 points, or 0.2 percent, at 1,834.3. Volume was 566.7 million
shares, up from 507.5 million shares a day earlier.
   Several traders said they were cautiously optimistic during the
morning session, but the release of the unemployment data knocked
the market lower in the afternoon. The news that the U.S. jobless
rate fell to 5.3 percent in October from 5.4 percent in the previous
month rekindled fears that the U.S. economy might be overheating.

   The stock market was lower in afternoon trading
today, pressured by new unemployment data that showed surprising
strength in the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 10.84 points at
2,159.50 at 2 p.m. EST.
   Declining issues edged out advancing ones by around 9 to 5 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 909 issues down, 451 up and 551
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 99.79 million shares.

<HEAD>Company Improves Drought Insurance Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chubb Corp., facing a class-action lawsuit by
farmers in 10 states who say they were unfairly denied drought
insurance, has offered another $43.7 million in coverage to some
farmers whose applications it had rejected this year.
   The company said Friday it is willing to proceed to reach a
settlement with farmers who applied for drought insurance, but were
rejected and filed suit against Chubb.
   The company made the offer Thursday in U.S. District Court in
Cincinnati where the lawsuit against Chubb is filed.
   The offer is subject to approval of Judge Carl B. Rubin, who is
presiding over the class-action lawsuit. It potentially represents
about 8,000 farmers in Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Tennessee, Illinois,
Minnesota, Michigan, Missouri, Iowa and Wisconsin.
   Chubb said it would be willing to reach an agreement similar to
one proposed in Minnesota, in which eligible applicants would
receive amounts equal to losses that would have been paid if an
applicant had been a policyholder, reduced by applicable premium
amounts and any goodwill payments already made.
   If such a settlement is accepted, Chubb said it would result in
an after-tax charge against earnings of $13 million, or 30 cents per
share, in the fourth quarter of 1988.
   Stanley M. Chesley, lead lawyer for the farmers, complained to
Rubin that Chubb was trying to outmaneuver Chesley by making
separate offers to farmers in Indiana and Minnesota.
   ``Then the judge challenged them to make it available to all the
states,'' said lawyer Janet Abaray, an aide to Chesley.
   After a recess, Chubb attorneys came back with the $43.7 million
proposal. Ms. Abaray said the farmers' lawyers will use the figure
as a starting point for new negotiations.
   She said farmers whose rain insurance claims were honored would
get nothing more. Also ineligible would be farmers whose premiums
were rejected, but whose land got too much rain to qualify if they
had had policies.
   Ms. Abaray said payments would go to farmers whose applications
were rejected, but who would have received payments as drought
victims. The payments would be made in those cases only where the
amounts exceed the premiums and the ``good-will'' payments already
made by Chubb to rejected applicants.
   Whatever settlement is reached will be shared by all of the
members of the class, she said.
   Chubb, based in Warren, N.J., began rejecting payments in
mid-year when it said brokers sold more coverage than planned. Chubb
lawyers said the company was prepared to sell about $40 million
coverage and brokers sold more than $300 million.
   Chubb spokeswoman Gail Devlin said Friday the company has made
$11 million in goodwill payments and plans no further such payments.
   Chubb said in an Oct. 17 statement that its Federal Insurance Co.
subsidiary issued 1,176 policies in seven Midwestern states in the
1988 drought insurance program, extending a total of $43 million in
policy coverage. Chubb said Federal Insurance suffered $20 million
in losses on those policies and has paid virtually all of them to
the policyholders.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
lower Friday in a quiet finish to a volatile session on the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   The markets had opened higher on strength from the soybeans,
which took off like a shot in response to the Agriculture
Department's surprise announcement late Thursday that the Soviet
Union had purchased 535,000 metric tons of U.S. soybeans and that
another 540,000 metric tons of soybeans and soymeal had been sold to
undisclosed destinations.
   But soybean prices fell rapidly as the market absorbed the news.
Grain futures also dropped.
   Soybeans finished mixed on strength stemming from ideas that
additional soybean sales to the Soviets would be forthcoming,
analysts said.
   ``There does seem to be a feeling that some more business will be
transacted,'' said Joel Karlin, a research analyst with Research
Department Inc. in Chicago.
   But traders saw little chance for large export sales of corn or
wheat in the near future, he said.
   At the close, wheat was \ cent to 2 cents lower with the contract
for delivery in December at $4.15{ a bushel; corn was 1{ cents to 4
cents lower with December at $2.78{ a bushel; oats were unchanged to
5 cents lower with December at $2.17 a bushel; soybeans were 2\

   Stock prices made a quick recovery in the morning but later slid
back, in what analysts said was a close tracking of bond prices.
Activity remained subdued, as it has through most of the week, by
anticipation of Tuesday's presidential election.
   ``We're kind of held captive to the bond market,'' said Philip
Puccio, a senior vice president at Dillon, Read & Co.
   Like stocks, bond prices were gutted by fears of higher interest
rates.
   Earlier in the week, many observers had been expecting the Fed to
keep credit policy and interest rates stable in the near future.
Recent signs that the economy is slowing and inflationary pressures
are easing would make the central bank loathe to push interest rates
higher, they believed.
   But a recent slide in the dollar raised concern that the Fed
could nudge interest rates higher in order to bolster the U.S.
currency. The dollar steadied late in the week, but the fear of
higher rates was rekindled by today's unemployment figures.

<TEXT>
   Britain's investigation of Minorco SA's $4.7
billion takeover bid for Consolidated Gold Fields PLC makes it
unnecessary for the United States to look into whether a merger of
the two companies would endanger the supply of strategic minerals,
U.S. officials said Friday.
   Under British, law Minorco's bid for Consolidated Gold Fields, a
British company, lapsed on Oct. 25 when it was referred to the
British Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
   ``That won't prevent a U.S. investigation if there is a new
bid,'' Treasury spokesman Robert Levine said.
   The British government decided to investigate the offer after a
federal judge in New York issued an injunction against the deal
because it might violate U.S. antitrust law.
   Sen. Robert Dole, R-Kan., the Republican minority leader, wrote
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady on Oct. 25 urging an
investigation on the ground that U.S. national security was at risk.
   ``I view with concern the possibility of control by the South
African conglomerate of U.S. gold reserves, coal and other
significant business interests,'' Dole wrote.
   He added that the proposed merger would give South African
interests a substantial percentage of the world supply of platinum
and of feedstocks for titanium, used in alloys for jet engines, and
for zirconium, used in the cores of nuclear reactors.
   ``Continued access to these minerals is of vital strategic
significance to the national security interests of the United
States,'' he said.
   Similar letters were written by at least 20 other members of
Congress.
   On Oct. 5 Consolidated Gold Fields and Newmont Mining Corp. asked
President Reagan for the investigation under the new Trade Act,
which allows him to forbid a merger that threatens national security.
   Consolidated Gold Fields owns 49.3 percent of Newmont, this
country's largest gold producer. It also produces the titanium and
zirconium feedstocks.
   Minorco, based in Luxembourg, is controlled by the big South
African gold and diamond mining firms, Anglo American Corp. and De
Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. Minorco already owns 29.6 percent of
Consolidated Gold Fields.
   The law gives the president 30 days from the filing of the
request to decide on an investigation. Those 30 days were up on
Friday.
   Levine said Consolidated Gold Fields was informed of the decision
not to investigate by a letter from Stephen J. Canner, director of
the Treasury's office of international investment.
   The Treasury refused to release copies of the letters.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished higher Friday following a
better-than-expected improvement in the nation's unemployment rate
during October.
   Gold prices were little changed after falling overseas. Republic
National Bank of New York said gold bullion was bid at $421.50 a
troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, slightly higher than $420.85 an ounce
late Thursday.
   The dollar rose overseas following release of the Labor
Department employment data, which indicated the economy is not
slowing. The currency continued to gain ground when trading shifted
to the United States.
   The government said the unemployment rate fell to 5.3 percent in
October, from 5.4 percent in the previous month. Traders said the
news might lead the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy, a
move that would push up interest rates and make dollar-denominated
investments more attractive.
   Jesse Torres, chief dealer at the Bank of Boston's New York
office, noted that institutional investors had a large appetite for
the dollar. ``The employment report renewed hope in the U.S.
economy,'' he said.
   The belief that Vice President George Bush will win the
presidential election Tuesday and continue current economic policies
also boosted traders' optimism, Torres said.
   But Yani Budiman, vice president of Chemical New York Capital
Markets Group, speculated there is still some concern heading into
the election. He questioned whether market participants would ``have
the nerve to keep their positions'' as polling approaches.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 124.63 yen, down 0.05 yen from
Wednesday's close. Japanese markets were closed Thursday for a
national holiday. In London, the dollar traded Friday at 125.35 yen,
and in New York, the dollar rose to 124.93 yen from 124.68 yen on
Thursday.
   In London, the dollar gained strongly against the British pound.
It cost $1.7655 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.7805 late
Thursday. In New York it cost $1.7661 to buy one pound, less
expensive than Thursday's $1.7775.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's prices, included: 1.7910 West German marks, up from
1.7778; 1.5013 Swiss francs, up from 1.4906; 6.1188 French francs,
up from 6.0726; 1,330.50 Italian lire, up from 1,322.25, and 1.2230
Canadian dollars, up from 1.2212.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday,
included: 1.7955 West German marks, up from 1.7760; 1.5060 Swiss
francs, up from 1.4863; 6.1215 French francs, up from 6.0565; 2.0253
Dutch guilders, up from 1.9990; 1,332.50 Italian lire, up from
1,317.50, and 1.2223 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2234.
   Gold prices were mixed. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold
bullion was unchanged at $421.50 a troy ounce.
   Earlier, gold fell in London to a late bid price of $420.25 a
troy ounce, compared with late Thursday's $422.25. In Zurich, gold
closed at a bid $420.50, down from $421.85 bid late Thursday.
Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid $421.86, down from
$422.99 bid at Thursday's close.
   Silver finished at $6.425 a troy ounce on New York's Comex, up
from Thursday's $6.410. In London, the metal was trading at a late
bid price of $6.40 a troy ounce, compared with from $6.51 bid late
Thursday.

<HEAD>Cocoa Prices Soar On Tight-Supply Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cocoa futures prices roared to three-month highs Friday on New
York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange on panic buying amid
speculation that the world's leading producers were planning to
withhold supplies from the market.
   On other exchanges, livestock and meat posted strong gains;
precious metals were mixed; energy futures were mixed; grains and
soybeans were mostly lower and stock-index futures retreated.
   Cocoa for delivery in December, which had hit a 13-year-low near
$1,100 per metric ton in late September, soared above $1,400 Friday
and settled at $1,403, $94 above Thursday's final price. It was the
highest close since Aug. 12.
   ``It seems that everybody was buying _ the trade, the
speculators, the locals _ everybody was buying and nobody was
selling,'' said Arthur Stevenson, a cocoa market analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   Analysts said two factors sparked the rally and both of them were
related to the Ivory Coast, the world's largest producer and source
of the most highly prized cocoa beans.
   For much of this year, the Ivory Coast has withheld its cocoa
from the world market, hoping to force prices higher. But with the
new crop now being harvested, the West African nation was running
out of storage space and had to find more room or sell some cocoa.
   On Friday, a rumor surfaced that the Ivory Coast and at least one
French trading firm had reached an agreement that would allow the
Ivory Coast to withhold another 400,000 metric tons of cocoa from
the market, Stevenson said.
   Meanwhile, the Ivory Coast's official newspaper reported Friday
the 11 other nations in the Cocoa Producers Alliance, a group that
accounts for more than four-fifths of the world's cocoa output, were
considering adopting withholding policies similar to the Ivory
Coast's. The alliance is scheduled to meet next week.
   ``Naturally, all of this coming out on one day induced a panic
reaction,'' Stevenson said.
   Live cattle and live hog futures finished strongly higher on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, partially reversing Thursday's sharp
losses and continuing the volatile trading pattern of the past week.
   Both the cattle and pork markets are struggling between
conflicting perceptions of their future direction, said Thomas
Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp. in Arlington Heights,
Ill.
   In the cattle market, heavy slaughter weights and slack demand on
the cash markets signal that prices will weaken. But cattle supplies
typically decline and prices normally rise during the three weeks
before Thanksgiving, and bullish traders expect the market to follow
that pattern, Morgan said.
   The pork markets normally hit a seasonal low at this time of
year, he said. Bullish traders keep trying to pick the bottom while
the bears see near-record supplies of pork bellies in cold storage
and believe pork prices must move lower.
   The choppiness of both markets ``signifies the level of
uncertainty right now and the fact that there are two sides to the
story,'' Morgan said.
   Live cattle settled .10 cent to 1 cent higher with December at
73.75 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .50 cent higher
with November at 81.50 cents a pound; hogs were .25 cent lower to
.75 cent higher with December at 41.75 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .02 cent to .65 cent higher with February at 46.30
cents a pound.
   Precious metals futures were mixed in uneventful trading.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled 20 cents lower to
20 cents higher with December at $423.50 a troy ounce; silver was
1.5 cents to 2.7 cents higher with December at $6.465 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures finished mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange
in trading dominated by technical factors in the absence of fresh
news.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 9 cents lower to 14
cents higher with December at $14.04 a barrel; heating oil was .24
cent lower to .05 cent higher with December at 44.08 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .48 cent to 1.14 cents higher with December at
46.34 cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures prices ended mostly lower in a quiet
finish to a volatile session on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat settled \ cent to 2 cents lower with December at $4.15} a
bushel; corn was 1{ cents to 4{ cents lower with December at $2.78 a
bushel; oats were \ cent to 5 cents lower with December at $2.17 a
bushel; soybeans were 2\ cents lower to 2\ cents higher with
November at $7.92 a bushel.
   Stock-index futures fell sharply on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange with the contract for December delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 off 3.35 points at 276.25.

<TEXT>
   Long Island Lighting Co. shareholders
adopted an agreement Friday that would close the Shoreham nuclear
power plant and give LILCO guaranteed rate increases over the next
10 years.
   After a two-hour meeting, the vote was announced: 78 million
share-votes in favor of the settlement and 1.2 million against.
   ``The time has come to remove the uncertainty created by the
controversy and to look ahead,'' LILCO Chairman William Catacosinos
said.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo worked out the settlement with LILCO as a way of
resolving the issue of the Shoreham plant, a $5.4 billion project
whose opening has been opposed by state and Suffolk County officials
on grounds there would be no way to evacuate that part of Long
Island if nuclear accident occurred.
   The plant, completed in 1985 a decade late and at seven times the
original estimated cost, has been prevented from operating at full
power because of state and county refusal to join in emergency
evacuation planning.
   Recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court and the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission have said a utility can impose its own
emergency plan, which would open the way for Shoreham to operate.
   LILCO's deal with Cuomo expires on Nov. 18 without shareholder
and legislative approval.
   Cuomo said Thursday the deadline may have to be extended because
the state Legislature will not convene until late this month or
early December.
   Catacosinos said he would recommend the board of directors grant
an extension on the settlement until at least Dec. 1.
   The governor has had a tough time convincing Long Island's
legislators in Albany to approve the deal. The Long Islanders
maintain the utility's customers can't afford the rate increases
provided in the plan _ about 5 percent a year for the next 10 years.
   If the agreement goes through, the state Power Authority would
pay $1 for Shoreham and then build non-nuclear electric-generating
stations to supply the power that would have been produced by
Shoreham.
   The deal also provides for LILCO to resume paying dividends on
its common and preferred stock. The utility, teetering on the edge
of a bankruptcy filing, suspended dividends in 1984.
   In addition to the decade of 5 percent annual rate increases, the
deal would permit LILCO to recover all remaining costs of the plant
through electric rates over the next 40 years.

<TEXT>
   Computer viruses are disrupting the information
age the same way AIDS has cooled the sexual revolution.
   Viruses strike at the promise that people can manipulate massive
projects from their own keyboards while trading time-saving programs
freely with friends and colleagues.
   Although viruses spread by pranksters and criminals have caused
little damage so far, they have the potential to wreak havoc by
destroying data or impeding the computers that are increasingly
important to business and government.
   As a result, security measures are sure to increase, which will
make computers less convenient and accessible.
   ``The brave new world of computing, I think, is still becoming a
reality. But there's a (need for a) gatekeeper,'' Richard tenEyck,
telecommunications director of the Boston Computer Society, said
Friday.
   A virus that swept across the country this week temporarily
crippled the computing centers of several major universities and
research centers. Business began to return to normal Friday as
computer operators cleaned out copies of the rapidly multiplying
program.
   In attempts to control viruses, there will be much stricter
limits on who can use certain programs and databases and under what
conditions. This will make it harder for people to work together in
computer networks.
   New pieces of software, no matter how seemingly beneficial, will
be tested at length, especially if they come from insecure sources.
   Certain programs that check for evidence of contamination will be
run every time someone sits down to use a piece of software, causing
frustrating delays.
   There could even be delays in everyday activities such as using a
credit card.
   In short, steps to protect against computer viruses will drain
computers of two of their most important attributes: speed and
accessibility.
   ``What I think it does is spell the end of the user-friendly
era,'' tenEyck said.
   Even with time-consuming and expensive precautions, viruses will
remain a problem.
   Once a computer has been contaminated with a virus it is almost
impossible to ensure that every trace of the virus has been
eradicated, said Mary Carol Chruscicki, program manager for system
reliability work at a Rome, N.Y., institute that performs studies
for the Defense Department.
   Some people have expressed concerns that the danger of computer
viruses will turn the clock back to the days when the only computers
were mainframes in locked ``glass houses,'' operated by people in
white coats.
   Ms. Chruscicki said she does not think that will happen.
   ``The world of information is here and computer users don't want
to go back to where they're sheltered from what's out there, whether
it's a low-cost product or a free product,'' she said.
   ``The key issue is that with proper precautions, one can continue
to live a normal existence,'' said Delbert Jones of the National LAN
Laboratory in Reston, Va.
   More than 60 companies this week endorsed a set of guidelines
drafted by the National LAN Laboratory that are intended to prevent
and control viruses.
   Among the recommendations:
   _All software should be purchased from known, reputable sources.
   _New software should be quarantined on an isolated computer for
testing.
   _Back-up copies of all master software and computer data should
be made at least once a month so the back-ups can be used if the
current versions are corrupted by a virus.
   ``It's very much like the AIDS virus: The best solution is
precaution,'' Jones said.
   A computer virus is a program that ``infects'' other programs by
modifying them to include a copy of itself. It can spread from one
computer to another and alter or destroy data.
   Viruses are usually communicated by data transmission over phone
lines, or by someone inserting a contaminated floppy disk into a
computer.
   However, computer viruses have been found in packaged software
from Aldus Corp. At one Texas company, a computer ``time bomb''
planted by a fired employee wiped out 168,000 payroll records three
years ago.
   Last December, International Business Machines Corp. had to shut
down its worldwide network to eradicate a multiplying piece of code.
   Jones said precautions will inevitably, but necessarily, delay
the work done by computers.
   ``You're going to find some hard choices having to be made
between a user's ability to produce top-quality output and the costs
of providing that user with free access,'' tenEyck said.
   Many of the precautions that will be put in place are long
overdue, analysts said.
   Even the Defense Department, which keeps its most important
computers locked in vaults, does not seal the machines from the
outside world, said Ms. Chruscicki, of the IIT Research Institute's
branch in Rome, N.Y.
   ``The problem is with these viruses, while you are in the non-top
secret mode, that virus could be getting in there. We don't have
mechanisms in place to detect that,'' she said.
   She said the Defense Department's attempts to improve security
were being delayed by budget cuts. ``Everyone knows what to do.
It's, who's going to pay for it?''

   Sun Oil Co. has agreed to divest petroleum
stocks and sales operations in two counties of New York and
Pennsylvania as part of its takeover of Atlantic Petroleum, the
Federal Trade Commission announced Friday.
   The company signed a consent agreement promising to dispose of
operations in the Williamsport, Pa., and Binghamton, N.Y. areas to
settle charges the merger would reduce competition in the sale of
gasoline and other light petroleum products.
   Sun, based in Radnor, Pa., has proposed buying the stock of
Atlantic Petroleum from Maatschappij BV, a Netherlands company. Sun
will pay $513 million for the stock and an additional $113 million
for the Atlantic Petroleum inventories. Atlantic is based in King of
Prussia, Pa.
   Under terms of the agreement, Sun has six months to dispose of
facilities in the two areas, including 15 Arco service stations in
Broome County, N.Y. and Lycoming County, Pa.

   The stock market fell Friday in subdued trading,
pressured by new unemployment data that showed surprising strength
in the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials lost 24.54 points to end
at 2,145.80, its low point of the day. That gave the blue-chip
indicator a net loss for the week of 4.09 points.
   In the broader market, declining issues outpaced advances by
about 5 to 2 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed
stocks, with 1,003 issues down, 450 up and 522 unchanged.
   Stocks started off sharply lower in response to the government's
report that unemployment fell to 5.3 percent in October, the lowest
level in 14 years, as the economy created more than 300,000 jobs.
   The unexpectedly low jobless rate fueled concern that the economy
could be heating up, and the Federal Reserve could move to rein in
inflation by nudging interest rates higher.
   ``It was a negative surprise,'' said Michael Metz, an analyst for
Oppenheimer & Co.
   Stock prices made a quick recovery in the morning but later slid
back, in what analysts said was a close tracking of bond prices.
Activity remained dampened, as it has through most of the week, by
anticipation of next Tuesday's presidential election.
   ``We're kind of held captive to the bond market,'' said Philip
Puccio, a senior vice president at Dillon, Read & Co.
   Like stocks, bond prices were hurt by fears of higher interest
rates. The yield on the Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond,
which moves inversely to its price, surged to 8.87 percent from 8.74
percent late Thursday.
   Earlier in the week, many observers had been expecting the Fed to
keep credit policy and interest rates stable in the near future.
Recent signs that the economy is slowing and inflationary pressures
are easing would make the central bank loathe to push interest rates
higher, they believed.
   But a recent slide in the dollar raised concern that the Fed
could nudge interest rates higher in order to bolster the U.S.
currency. The dollar steadied late in the week, but the fear of
higher rates was rekindled by the unemployment figures _ the final
economic report before the election.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE totaled 143.58 million shares,
down from 152.98 million in Thursday's session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at
regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled
173.76 million shares.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.38 to 155.70.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, Sears Roebuck dropped
1] to 44| after surging Thursday on takeover speculation, RJR
Nabisco fell } to 85|, IBM declined ~ to 120\, AT&T slipped [ to 28|
and Ford Motor lost ~ at 49|.
   Tenneco was up { at 50\, Kraft was unchanged at 103\ and DPL was
flat at 27.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was down
2.28 at 297.52.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index fell 3.42 to 318.09, and S&P's
500-stock composite index was down 2.89 at 276.31.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slipped 1.75 to 381.02.
   The Wilshire Associates Equity Index, the market value of NYSE,
American and OTC issues, was down $22.485 billion, or 0.82 percent.

   Bond prices tumbled and interest rates soared
Friday after the government reported the October unemployment rate
fell to the lowest level in more than four years.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond fell nearly 2 points, or
about $18.75 per $1,000 face amount.
   Its yield, which moves inversely to its price and often is a key
indicator of the direction of interest rates, jumped to 8.90 percent
from 8.74 percent late Thursday. Shorter-term rates also moved
higher.
   Analysts said the lower-than-expected jobless rate and healthy
growth of new jobs last month fueled investor concern the economy is
not slowing down as anticipated.
   ``It's a straight forward story. The market has been rallying
precisely because the labor market for August and September were
weaker than the economics profession suggested,'' said Maury Harris,
an economist with PaineWebber Inc.
   ``Then suddenly the economic data are revised up and now we're
talking about the economy not being as weak as everbody said it
was,'' he said.
   Analysts said prices started out lower as caution gripped the
market in advance of the labor report. Then, almost immediately
after the Labor Department's 8:30 a.m. announcement that October's
jobless rate fell 0.1 percentage point to 5.3 percent _ the lowest
level since May 1984 _ a selloff began.
   ``It was a knee-jerk reaction to these employment numbers,'' said
Marshall B. Front, an economist at the Chicago investment and
mutual-fund management firm of Stein Roe & Farnham. ``They were a
surprise to most people who felt that they would be a continuation
of a trend toward a less robust business.''
   F. Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist for Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets Inc. said the credit markets were unnerved by
numbers showing employers added 325,000 new jobs last month, an
indication the manufacturing sector of the economy remains strong.
   A more vibrant economy signals higher inflation, which erodes the
value of fixed-income securities such as bonds and notes. Higher
inflation also suggests the Federal Reserve might move to tighten
credit by raising interest rates.
   ``Now it's fruitless to talk about the Fed raising interest
rates,'' said Maury Harris, an economist with PaineWebber Inc. ``The
economy is doing well now so the Fed doesn't need to ease anytime
soon either.''
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues lost between 11-32 point and 7-16 point,
intermediate maturities were down between 11-16 point and 1] point
and long-term issues fell 1| points, according to figures provided
by Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a
bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 9.48 to 1,148.78.
   Corporate bonds also were lower. Moody's Investment Grade
Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate
bonds with maturities of five years or longer, dropped 2.08 to
295.96.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills, meanwhile, rose to 7.71
percent as the discount gained 11 basis points to 7.47 percent.
Yields on six-month bills increased to 8.05 percent as the discount
rose 18 basis points to 7.64 percent. Yields on one-year bills
soared to 8.23 percent with the discount up 19 basis points to 7.66
percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 8 3-16, down from 8 5-16 percent late Thursday.

   Federal regulators announced Friday that a
financially troubled New Jersey savings and loan institution was
being acquired by a California institution.
   Officials said the acquisition of Lincoln Federal Savings and
Loan Association of Westfield, N.J. represented the 140th troubled
S&L case resolved this year.
   Lincoln Federal is being acquired by First Nationwide Bank of San
Francisco.
   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which insures
deposits at savings and loans, said it was providing assistance
totaling $145.7 million, including $40 million in cash, as part of
the deal.
   In a news release announcing the acquisition, officials said
Lincoln Federal began experiencing problems when the institution
invested in out-of-state commercial loans, mortgages and consumer
loans, many of them concentrated in Texas, Oklahoma and Colorado,
regions of the country which have been hit hard by depressed
conditions in the energy industry.
   Lincoln Federal operates 15 branches in New Jersey. The branches
will conduct business as usual and depositors will experience no
interruption in service, FSLIC said.
   Federal regulators said all accounts will continue under the same
terms and conditions with depositors continuing to be insured to the
maximum $100,000 by FSLIC.
   Including this transaction, FSLIC has merged 117 troubled S&Ls
with healthier institutions. The agency has liquidated 22 other
insolvent S&Ls and has helped to recapitalize one other institution.
   First Nationwide is a subsidiary of First Nationwide Financial
Corp., which is owned by Ford Motor Co. It has assets of $24 billion
with 400 branches in 15 states.
   Lincoln Federal had assets valued at $1.27 billion and
liabilities of $1.32 billion for a negative net worth of $56.4
million.
   In addition to the $40 million in cash, FSLIC said it was
providing a seven-year note of $115 million. FSLIC said the current
value of the federal assistance was $145.7 million.

   Scientists at Los Alamos National
Laboratory said Friday they are working on a cure for viral
infections like the one that infiltrated research computers this
week.
   Computer security experts said the virus made life inconvenient
for researchers, but did no known permanent damage and did not enter
the lab's classified computers.
   Computer security officer Jimmy McClary said the laboratory was
able to identify the virus and cleanse it from the system with a
code akin to a computer ``vaccine.''
   ``The most useful aspect of these sort of events is that they
occur in an unclassified, non-sensitive environment that lets us
look at the techniques used to introduce these viruses,'' said
McClary.
   This week's virus was able to infiltrate the UNIX operating
system that links scientific laboratories nationwide, infecting Los
Alamos, its sister facility, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
in California, and numerous other government and private research
facilities.
   ``This is the largest scale virus attack that I have seen that
was distributed across the country,'' McClary said.
   A computer virus is a program that ``infects'' other programs by
modifying them to include a copy of itself. It can spread from one
computer to another and alter or destroy data.
   Viruses are usually communicated by data transmission over phone
lines, or by someone inserting a contaminated floppy disk into a
computer.
   McClary said two main efforts are under way to guard against
future viruses.
   ``The first is to use computers to guard computers against
viruses _ enhanced intrusion detection techiques that let you look
for unexpected or unexplained changes in the behavior of a computer
system,'' he said. ``The other approach ... is to develop anti-viral
code, vaccines if you like, to carry the analogy further, that
amount to self-examining code, so the code itself will know if
someone makes an unauthorized change to it.''
   McClary said scientists working at remote terminals, all using
the UNIX operating system, began experiencing delays in gaining
access to their research data late Wednesday. He said he believes
the first clues occurred about an hour after the virus entered the
computers.
   Los Alamos and the other laboratories will analyze the virus code
to determine its source, said McClary.
   ``What they'll have to do is follow each path that they're able
to pick up at some point and go back along that path,'' he said.
``Generally, you can trace back. We don't know yet enough about this
one. This one does a fair job of cleaning up after itself.''
   He said laboratory scientists disconnected the source of the
virus from the computing system Thursday morning. Later in the
morning, the U.S. Department of Energy informed the lab a computer
virus existed.
   The virus came in through the electronic mail system by which
scientific data is transmitted among research institutions, McClary
said.

<HEAD>Proposal to Extend Joint Operating Agreement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A joint operating agreement between The Miami
News and The Miami Herald would be extended from 1996 until Dec. 31,
2021 under an amendment to the agreement released Friday by the
Justice Department.
   Under the amendment filed Thursday with the government, Cox
Enterprises Inc., which owns The News, would continue to share in
the operating income of The Herald until the year 2021.
   The sharing of net annual operating income would continue if The
News is sold or stops publication, Cox chairman James Kennedy said
in a letter to the Justice Department outlining the amendment.
   The amendment filed with the Justice Department also would
require Cox to absorb all losses of The News beginning in 1990; and
reduce Cox's share of the Herald's income beginning in 1989.
   After the first $7.5 million in net annual operating income,
which goes to The Herald, Cox in 1989 would receive 14 percent of
the income; 13 percent in 1990; 12 percent in 1991; 11 percent in
1992; and 10 percent from 1993 to 2021.
   Kennedy's letter said The News has sustained losses of more than
$90 million since the JOA was instituted in 1966 with The Herald,
owned by Knight-Ridder Inc.
   It was announced Oct. 14 that The News would close Dec. 31 if no
buyer is found. Company officials cited declining circulation _
which now stands at less than 48,000 _ and continuing financial
losses at the 92-year-old daily.
   In announcing the decision to sell or close The News, Cox
officials had said a continued JOA would not be a part of the deal.
   Cox Enterprises has fielded more than 30 inquiries from
prospective buyers, and meetings with several of them are scheduled
within the next few days for fact-gathering by both sides.
   The News' production, advertising, circulation and promotion
departments are owned by The Miami Herald Publishing Co.

<HEAD>Grand Met: Pillsbury Using ``Just Say No'' Defense</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pillsbury Co. appears to be using a ``just say
no'' defense against the $5.23 billion takeover bid from Grand
Metropolitan PLC, a lawyer for the British distilling and gaming
conglomerate said Friday.
   ``Pillsbury keeps saying `We need more time,''' Stuart Gold told
a hearing in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington, Del. ``That
doesn't cut.''
   Gold was appearing before Justice William Duffy, who was asked to
block Pillsbury from using a corporate poison pill to defend against
Grand Met's unsolicited $60-a-share, all-cash tender offer. Duffy
took the case under advisement and did not indicate when he would
issue a ruling.
   Grand Met has said it intends to start buying Pillsbury stock on
Tuesday.
   Gold urged Duffy to remove the poison pill defense so that
shareholders can decide for themselves if the offer is adequate. He
said Pillsbury's board of directors has not been able to come up
with an alternative after meeting four times since the offer was
made.
   He said Pillsbury has exceeded by 10 days the 20-day deadline
under the Williams Act for a target company to respond to a tender
offer.
   Pillsbury's board of directors rejected the offer as
``inadequate'' Oct. 17, but has not offered an alternative to
shareholders and has not negotiated the offer with Grand Met.
   Steven Rothschild, a Pillsbury lawyer, said the 20-day deadline
under the Williams Act doesn't begin until an ``adequate'' tender
offer is on the table. He also said Pillsbury is not obligated to
negotiate with Grand Met because the food and restaurant company is
not for sale.
   He likened Grand Met's argument about the Williams Act to a
``terrorist time bomb threat.
   ``Come to the target with a hostile offer, drop a time bomb in
the target's pocket, and say, `you have 20 days,''' Rothschild said.
   Rothschild said Pillsbury does not intend to drop its poison pill
defense plan, also known as a shareholders' rights plan.
   He did not say what alternatives to the tender offer the
Pillsbury board is considering, but he said the board is carrying
out its fiduciary responsibility to get maximum value out of the
company's stock.
   The poison pill, which was adopted by Pillsbury in 1986 and
amended before Grand Met launched its takeover bid Oct. 4, would
result in a ``disastrous dilution'' of Pillsbury stock, Gold said.
   Under the poison pill defense, Pillsbury could issue new stock
once Grand Met acquired a certain percentage of the existing stock.
The new stock could be purchased by shareholders for less than Grand
Met could buy it for, making the takeover more expensive.
   Rothschild said Pillsbury is protecting its shareholders by
keeping the poison pill in place. He said outside consultants have
told Pillsbury's board that the $60 price is not fair.
   Gold challenged the statement, asking Rothschild why Pillsbury's
stock price hasn't escalated much higher than $60 a share on the New
York Stock Exchange if it has greater value. The stock traded in the
range of $37 a share before the tender offer was announced. On
Friday, Pillsbury closed at $60.37{ a share, down 50 cents.
   Stephen Oestreich, a lawyer representing dissident shareholders
at Friday's hearing, said, ``shareholders ought to be in the board
room'' if the directors don't think Grand Met's offer is worth
negotiating.
   Oestreich urged Pillsbury to ``take off the boxing gloves'' and
talk to Grand Met about the offer, which Grand Met has said is
negotiable.
   Rothschild said that silence itself is a negotiating tool.
   Grand Met's Gold also asked the judge to enjoin Pillsbury from
challenging the takeover bid on the basis of state tied-house laws.
The laws prevent liquor distillers from selling alcohol at retail
outlets.
   Grand Met has said it would sell Pillsbury's full-service
restaurants, which sell alcohol, if the takeover bid is successful.

   Technical buying continued to dominate the energy
futures market, where prices of petroleum products turned mixed in
quiet trading.
   ``That's been the trend we've seen recently,'' Peter Beutel, an
energy analyst with Elders Futures Inc., said Friday. ``Things have
been quiet in advance of the OPEC meeting.''
   Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries plan
to meet in about two weeks to discuss curbing production to help
prop up sagging worldwide oil prices.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, prices of unleaded gasoline
and crude oil headed higher Friday while wholesale home heating oil
continued to decline.
   The December contract for unleaded gasoline increased 1.14 cents
to 46.34 cents a gallon, after rising 1.41 cents on Thursday. Other
contract months were higher.
   Beutel said the increase was fundamental. ``To makea long story
short ... there's increased demand and reduced supply,'' he said.
   Among other refined petroleum products traded on the exchange
Friday, the December contract for wholesale home heating oil, which
rose 0.97 cent a gallon on Thursday, closed down 0.24 cent to 44.08
cents.
   The December contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
U.S. crude, closed at $14.04 a barrel, up 14 cents. The contract
rose 15 cents on Thursday.

<TEXT>
   A government report showing the economy created 325,000 new jobs
last month and pushed unemployment to a 14-year low has unnerved the
inflation-sensitive stock and bond markets but elated Republican
presidential campaigners.
   In the last major economic report before the election, the Labor
Department said Friday the 0.1 percentage point drop in the jobless
rate to 5.3 percent in October partly reflected the creation of
99,000 new manufacturing jobs, the biggest monthly increase in that
category since February 1984.
   Although department officials cautioned that the October pickup
in factory employment was inflated by seasonal adjustments, the
report still showed payroll growth returning to the average monthly
rate of 300,000 achieved in 1986, 1987 and the first seven months of
1988.
   The 5.3 percent jobless rate in October matched June's rate as
the lowest since May 1974.
   ``The future is bright and it's getting brighter,'' President
Reagan said of the figures as he was leaving the White House to
campaign for his intended successor, Vice President George Bush,
with only a few days before the election next Tuesday. ``Nothing's
going to stop us now.''
   Private political and economic analysts agreed. Some speculated
that the figures were a significant blow to Democratic nominee
Michael Dukakis, who has made economic weakness under the
Republicans one of his main themes.
   The manufacturing employment gains plus figures in Friday's job
market report showing assembly line workers continued to work on
average 4 hours of overtime each week suggested a strengthening
economy. That conflicted with other reports over the last few weeks
that have indicated a slowdown.
   For stock and bondholders, the unemployment report was bad news
because it suggested impending inflation. That would force the
Federal Reserve to tighten credit, forcing interest rates up and
eroding the value of their investments.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks
fell 24.54 points to 2,145.80. Broader market barometers also
slumped. In bond trading, the Treasury's key 30-year issue fell
about $18 per $1,000 in face amount, and its yield surged to 8.89
percent from 8.74 percent late Thursday.
   The reaction was the opposite for the dollar, which had been
declining partly on the assumption that the economy is slowing down.
The U.S. currency rose sharply in the foreign exchange markets,
although many economists said the longer-term outlook for the dollar
looks lower.

   British publisher Robert Maxwell, taking charge
after his hard-fought victory in the battle for Macmillan Inc., says
he plans to encourage the growth of the publishing and information
services giant.
   But at the same time, Maxwell said his Maxwell Communication
Corp. planned to sell its British commercial printing operations and
possibly sell other assets to help reduce the debt incurred in the
buyout.
   The announcement Friday came just one day after Macmillan gave up
its six-month fight for independence and accepted Maxwell's takeover
bid.
   Maxwell Communication said the offer valued Macmillan at $2.6
billion and that 97.5 percent of Macmillan's shares had been
tendered by the deadline set in its $90.25 a share offer.
   Maxwell lost little time Friday in taking charge at Macmillan,
where he was elected chairman of the board, replacing Edward P.
Evans, who resigned.
   Evans had been part of a group led by the buyout firm Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts & Co. which lost out to Maxwell in the bidding for
Macmillan.
   Maxwell told a news conference at Macmillan headquarters that he
met with Macmillan's senior managers to assure them he planned to
make the company grow rather than break it up, and sent letters
making the same point to all of the company's employees.
   He lamented what he said was a change in style in American
management that has placed more emphasis on breakup values of
companies and less on loyalty to the company and its employees.
   Maxwell is chairman of Maxwell Communication, a London-based
printing and publishing concern that he has often said he wants to
make one of the world's 10 largest communications companies.
   The company will focus more on publishing and less on printing
following the Macmillan deal, he said.
   Maxwell said he plans to sell BPCC, Britain's largest commercial
printing business, perhaps to its management. He indicated it could
attract a bid of about $600 million.
   In addition, Maxwell said he is considering selling its British
newspaper printing business, which he said had a book value of $500
million.
   Maxwell is to retain his privately held Mirror Group Newspapers,
which owns the national Daily Mirror.
   At the New York news conference, Maxwell asserted that he has no
intention of selling any of Macmillan's publishing assets.
   ``I am a publisher, not a bookkeeper,'' he said, and added that
he hoped to improve the company's system for distributing books,
compete more aggressively for best-selling works and strive for
international publishing prominence.
   Maxwell said his company is still looking for possible publishing
acquisitions, but he declined to say whether they would approach the
size of the Macmillan purchase.
   Maxwell also recently announced plans to buy Dun and Bradstreet
Corp.'s Official Airline Guides for $750 million.
   BPCC prints books, consumer journals, magazines, documents,
packaging and labels. It had an operating profit of $62 million on
sales of about $534 million in 1987, Maxwell Communication said.
   In addition to the newspaper printing business, Maxwell
Communication said it was considering disposing of three recently
acquired printing plants in Europe and the company's property
portfolio.
   The company also said it intended to sell off divisions of
Macmillan that prove ``peripheral to our core strategy.''
   Macmillan's interests include the Katherine Gibbs secretarial and
Berlitz language schools and its Gumps retailing operations.
   Maxwell said while it was possible that these operations would be
sold, he said no decision on that issue has yet been made and each
company will be evalauted on its own merits.

   An investor group led by the buyout firm
Forstmann Little & Co. and that includes the consumer products giant
Procter & Gamble Co. has emerged as a possible ``white knight'' in
the fight for RJR Nabisco Inc.
   Forstmann Little said late Friday the group was considering a bid
for the food and tobacco products company that would surpass a $20.7
billion offer made by Nabisco management and a competing $20.3
billion bid by the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts Inc.
   In a statement, Forstmann Little said a special committee of the
RJR Nabisco board set up to review the offers ``had welcomed the
interest'' of the group, which also included the food companies
Ralston Purina Co. and Castle & Cooke Inc. and the investment firm
Goldman, Sachs & Co.
   The statement appeared to indicate RJR Nabisco was seeking a
white knight, or a friendly suitor, that could outbid Kohlberg
Kravis.
   Kohlberg Kravis, a leveraged buyout specialist, had been expected
to answer the $92-a-share bid from RJR Nabisco management by raising
its own $90-a-share offer.
   On Thursday, Kohlberg Kravis withdrew a $2.5 billion offer for
the publishing and information services giant Macmillan Inc., which
could leave the investment firm with considerable resources to mount
a battle for RJR Nabisco.
   The combination of Forstmann Little and its partners could be
expected to easily counter a higher Kohlberg Kravis bid.
   ``Each group member has indicated its intention to have a
continuing debt or equity participation in the entire transaction,''
the Forstmann Little statement said.
   Forstmann Little said RJR Nabisco had agreed to provide the group
with confidential information about its finances.
   There was no answer at the Atlanta offices of RJR Nabisco when a
reporter called late Friday to confirm the Forstmann Little
statement. There also was no answer at the offices of Kohlberg
Kravis' spokesmen.
   If either of the outstanding bids, or a higher bid by the
Forstmann Little group, is successful, it would rank as the largest
U.S. takeover in history.
   On Wednesday, a day before the management bid was announced, the
special committee of RJR Nabisco's board seemed to be attempting to
flush out other offers when it issued a statement saying it would
review all other bids for the company from credible parties. The
committee's chairman, Charles Hugel, already had acknowledged that
the sale of the company was a virtual certainty.
   The battle over the nation's 19th largest industrial concern _
the maker of such well known brands as Camel and Winston cigarettes,
Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers _ began last month when company
president F. Ross Johnson announced he and other top managers were
contemplating a $75-a-share deal valued at about $17 billion.
   Kohlberg Kravis countered with its own offer and said it hoped a
deal supported by RJR Nabisco's management could be worked out. When
Johnson's group rebuffed the firm, Kohlberg Kravis launched a tender
offer directly to stockholders, but still made the bid contingent on
winning management's cooperation.
   Kohlberg Kravis, RJR Nabisco and one of its financial partners in
the management-led buyout, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., talked off
and on over the past two weeks without success about a possible
joint effort to buy the company.
   Discussions that pitted Shearson Chairman Peter Cohen against his
one-time skiing partner, Henry Kravis, over joining forces to take
over RJR Nabisco also deteriorated.
   Kohlberg Kravis said the management bid ``did not foreclose
further discussions in the future although there could be no
assurances that such discussions would occur.''
   Procter & Gamble, which is based in Cincinnati, is the nation's
17th largest industrial company with sales of $17 billion in 1987.
   It is a leading soap and detergent maker, with brands such as
Tide, Cheer, Ivory, Zest and Oxydol. It also makes and markets Head
& Shoulders and Prell shampoos, Charmin bathroom tissue, Crisco
shortening and Folgers coffee.
   St. Louis-based Ralston is the world's largest producer of dry
dog and cat foods, including the Purina Dog and Cat Chow labels.
   It is also a leading maker of dry-cell batteries, including the
Eveready and Energizer brands, and makes Chex cereals and Wonder and
Hostess snack foods. Ralston had 1987 sales of $5.87 billion.
   Castle & Cooke Inc., based in Hawaii, grows, processes and
markets foods including Dole fresh fruits and processed foods and
Bud fresh vegetables.
   Its sales in 1987 amounted to $1.75 billion.
