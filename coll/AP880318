<HEAD>Former Army Europe Chief, 4-Star General Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bruce G. Clarke, a retired four-star general
who was the Army commander-in-chief in Europe when Berlin was the
focal point of the Cold War between the United States and the
Soviet Union, has died. He was 86.
   Clarke, who died Thursday at Walter Reed Army Hospital, had
suffered a stroke.
   The McLean, Va. resident was born in Adams, N.Y. He was
graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y. in
1925, and he later received a master's degree in civil engineering
from Cornell University and a law degree from La Salle Extension
University.
   During World War II, he commanded the Combat Command A in the
4th Armored Division and later commanded the division. During the
Korean War, he commanded the U.S. I Corps and later the X Corps of
the Far East Command.
   Later, he commanded the U.S. Army in the Pacific, the U.S. 7th
Army in Europe and the Continental Army Command at Fort Monroe, Va.
   He was commander-in-chief of the Army in Europe from 1960 to
1962 and was credited with keeping his troops in a high state of
training and morale while supervising patrols of air and ground
routes to Berlin.
   Clarke devoted himself to Army affairs after retiring in 1962,
writing frequently on matters such as training and command and
making an inspection of Vietnam in 1968.
   His wife, the former Bessie Mitchell, died in 1956.
   He is survived by three sons _ Bruce C. Clarke Jr. of St. Anton
a.d. Jessnitz, Austria; Dr. David A. Clarke of Colorado Springs,
Colo.; and Army Col. Gordon M. Clarke of San Antonio, Texas _ a
daughter, Mrs. Elisabeth Clark of Leesburg, Va.; two sisters, Mary
Griffin of Adams and Frances Saternow of Oswego, N.Y.; 18
grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.

<HEAD>Study Cites Lack of Relationship Between Dioxin and Birth Defects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A six-year study of the largest population ever
contaminated by the toxic chemical dioxin found no apparent
increase in birth defects.
   The study, published in Friday's Journal of the American Medical
Association, focused on babies born in and around Seveso, Italy,
from 1977 through 1982.
   A 1976 chemical accident ata factory in the area released a
cloud of dioxin that contaminated more than 37,200 residents in
Seveso and the neighboring towns of Meda, Cesano Maderno and Desio.
   The study said that if there is any increased risk related to
dioxin, ``the overall risk is unlikely to be large or might be
limited to very rare and specific birth defects.''
   ``Still more important,'' the study concluded, ``is the fact
that no infant with a major malformation was identified in the most
highly contaminated zone.''
   Dioxin, a byproduct of pesticide manufacture, causes cancer in
laboratory animals. It has not been directly linked to cancers in
humans.
   In the Italian study, doctors considered as defects only those
congenital malformations obvious at birth. Congenital problems that
manifest themselves later in life, such as mental retardation, were
not considered.
   The Seveso Congenital Malformations Registry, established
shortly after the accident, found that in 15,291 births, 742
infants were born with deformities, a rate of 48.5 per 1,000.
   The prevalence of deformities over the same period in a nearby
uncontaminated area used as a control was 48.8 per 1,000 births,
the study found.
   The quantity of dioxin released into the environment ``seemed to
be enormous'' but was never precisely determined, according to the
study.
   Levels of dioxin concentration found on the ground in the area
surrounding the factory were nearly 1,000 times higher than the
levels termed safe by state and federal officials after a cleanup
at Times Beach, Mo.
   Times Beach is now deserted and hundreds of families have filed
lawsuits against companies and individuals over their exposure to
dioxin contained in waste oil sprayed on their streets to control
dust in the 1970s.
   Questions about the effects of exposure to dioxin have lingered
since the Vietnam War. Dioxin is in Agent Orange, a defoliant used
during the war.
   Some veterans have sought government compensation, contending
their exposure resulted in cancers, rashes, headaches and other
side effects, as well as birth defects in their children.
   The Veterans Administration has contended numerous studies have
found no link between exposure and reported symptoms.

<DATELINE>PALMEROLA AIR BASE, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Planeloads of U.S. soldiers
streamed into this air base Thursday in a show of strength ordered
by President Reagan to counter what he called an invasion by
Nicaraguan forces.
   In northern Nicaragua, warplanes dropped bombs near a Sandinista
military headquarters Thursday, but no casualties or damage
resulted. Reporters at the scene said the explosives fell on the
Honduran side of the border.
   Nicaragua and a U.S. official said earlier that the raid was
aimed at the military post.
   The American troops were to engage in joint exercises with the
Hondurans. But the U.S. airlift was so hastily arranged that
American commanders were left scrambling to develop training
exercises to keep the men busy.
   Hundreds of soldiers bedded down in dusty fields near the
airstrip awaiting orders for training missions which normally are
arranged months in advance.
   The American troops were told to expect to spend about 10 days
in Honduras, but spokesmen said there was no official timetable yet
for them to leave.
   Two battalions from the renowned 82nd Airborne Division of Fort
Bragg, N.C., and two battalions from the 7th Light Infantry
Division of Fort Ord, Calif., were combined into a task force of
3,000 troops.
   A Honduran official said his government had given the
Sandinistas 24 hours to get out of the country, which they entered
in pursuit of Contra rebels.
   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua responded that his army was
``ready to combat and liquidate the famous forces of the 82nd
Airborne Division.''
   Maj. Gen. Carl W. Stiner, commander of the 82nd Airborne, said
he knew of no plan to have U.S. troops enter into the battle
between the Sandinistas and the U.S.-backed -Contras.
   ``We have not been told to do so,'' he said before leaving Fort
Bragg. He said the force was capable of that, if needed.
   Stiner also said there was no plan to use the troops if more
trouble broke out in nearby Panama.
   The American forces began arriving at Palmerola at 10:15 a.m. as
part of what the Pentagon called operation ``Golden Pheasant.''
   The 26 C-141 transport planes landed in the intense heat at
30-minute intervals at this air base, headquarters of U.S. military
operations in Honduras, 40 miles northwest of Tegucigalpa.
   The deployment was about 125 miles west of the area where Reagan
administration officials say the Nicaraguan Sandinista army has
chased rebel Contra forces over the border into Honduras.
   Col. Manuel Suarez Benavides, a Honduran armed forces spokesman,
said the deadline for the Sandinistas to leave was final.
   He said 2,000 Nicaraguan soldiers had crossed the border and
penetrated about six miles in pursuit of Contra rebels. A military
intelligence source said earlier the Nicaraguans were surrounded by
about 4,000 Honduran troopers.
   Suarez Benavides would not comment on Pentagon reports of new
Nicaraguan attacks inside Honduras.
   The Sandinista movements did not appear to be a full-fledged
invasion, Stiner said, adding that he saw the U.S. operation as a
deterrent.
   Ortega would not say whether his soldiers had crossed the border
in pursuit of the U.S.-supported rebels.
   ``Here the question is not if army troops penetrated Honduran
territory or not, but that we have dozens of camps of mercenary
forces in Honduran territory, in view of and tolerated by the
Honduran government,'' he said at a news conference in Managua.
   He said Nicaraguan soldiers would not withdraw from the border
area. Ortega called the U.S. troop deployment ``a dangerous act''
and demanded a meeting of the U.N. Security Council.
   A spokesman for the Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry said before the
news conference that Nicaragua had begun pulling its troops back
from the frontier region after driving about 2,000 Contra rebels
back into Honduras. The Defense and Foreign ministries denied that
Nicaraguan troops entered Honduras.
   Nicaraguan presidential spokesman Manuel Espinoza Enriquez later
said that air attackers fired at least five rockets Thursday at the
Nicaraguan military headquarters at Bocay, near the Honduras
border. Sandinista gunfire forced the planes to turn back, he said.
   Reporters saw two planes entering Nicaraguan air space from
Honduras. They saw nothing to support a report from a U.S. official
in Washington that a Soviet-built helicopter had been destroyed.
   Manuel Suarez, a Honduran spokesman in Tegucigalpa, denied the
Honduran air force crossed the border, and said it dropped at least
five bombs inside Honduras along the border near Bocay.
   Heavy fighting was reported Wednesday in the Olancho border
province about 125 miles east of Palmerola.
   Included in the American forces are two battalions from the 82nd
Airborne and two from a new division organized for quick movement
around the world. The 82nd Airborne and 7th Light Infantry are
based at opposite ends of the country.
   The final 800 U.S. troops are to arrive Friday by parachute,
weather permitting.
   In addition to the C-141 aircraft, a giant C-5A transport was
loaded with helicopter gunships for the exercise.
   The Honduran intelligence source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said: ``We will not allow the Sandinistas to move
farther into the interior of our territory. We want to avoid a
large conflict, but if it isn't possible, we will have to face the
invading troops.''
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said in Washington the
soldiers were being sent to ``get people's attention to what is
happening in Central America'' and say to the Honduran government:
``We are your friends.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the complete
deployment would take about 27 hours. The Defense Department said
nine helicopters and two light tanks were also sent.
   It was the the most dramatic show of U.S. force since the
Contras began fighting in Nicaragua six years ago, and it came in
response to a request for help from President Jose Azcona Hoyo of
Honduras.
   Since 1981, Honduras has been a key U.S. ally in Central America
and a major element in Reagan administration policy of fighting
Nicaragua's leftist government.
   About 1,100 American soldiers normally are stationed at several
military installations in Honduras. In addition, other national
guard and army troops rotate through for joint exercises,
road-building and other projects.

   Protesters flattened police barricades Thursday in San Francisco
and spray-painted slogans against the sending of troops to
Honduras, while demonstrators stopped traffic in Minneapolis and
marched in Boston and Philadelphia.
   About 25 people were arrested in San Francisco in one of several
protests in California. At Fort Ord, wives of some of the soldiers
sent to Honduras were among protesters at the gates. About 100
people demonstrated in Santa Rosa.
   In Minneapolis, 400 people dragged newspaper racks and benches
into a busy street, bringing traffic to a halt during the afternoon
rush hour.
   In Boston, 200 people marched in a circle and chanted ``U.S.
troops out of Honduras'' outside the John F. Kennedy Federal
Building. Police said six people remained inside after closing but
were evicted without incident.
   Protesters in Philadelphia erected a 30-foot ``Central America
War Memorial'' that mimicked the Vietnam Memorial in the nation's
capital. It bore the names of Central Americans killed in the
region's civil wars. About 200 people marched in front of the
federal courthouse.
   In San Francisco, 500 demonstrators outside the federal building
knocked down police barriers and chanted slogans.
   A few protesters linked arms and sat down, blocking the entrance
to the building. General Services Administration spokeswoman Mary
Filippini said 25 people were cited for obstructing the entrance
and creating a disturbance.
   Later Thursday, up to 2,000 demonstrators gathered at the
building. About 100 pounded on the windows as the crowd chanted,
``No more Contra aid.'' A few spray-painted slogans on the locked
building. No further arrests were made.
   At Fort Ord, where 1,200 soldiers of the 7th Light Infantry were
ordered to Honduras, the demonstrators included the wives of some
soldiers who were shipped out from the base 90 miles south of San
Francisco.
   A pregnant Renee Worthing, 21, wife of soldier James Worthing,
carried a sign that said, ``Stop The Lies.''
   ``I think the whole thing has just been a lie,'' she said. ``I
also think it has something to do with the presidential elections
because every time a presidential election comes up, a crisis comes
up and the president runs to the rescue. The community is not going
to stand for this.''

<TEXT>
   Churches were given increased protection
from libel suits in matters of religious doctrine Thursday when
California's Supreme Court refused to reinstate a $1.26 million
verdict.
   The high court, in a 5-2 vote, refused to hear an appeal by a
woman who sued the Worldwide Church of God after a minister
proclaimed her ``one of the enemies of God's church.''
   The court's action returns the case to Los Angeles Superior
Court for a retrial based on a new legal standard: whether the
minister knew his statements were false, or spoke in reckless
disregard of whether they were false.
   That standard already applied to libel suits filed by public
figures and government officials against newspapers and other news
media.
   In a precedent-setting decision that now has statewide effect, a
lower appeals court said the freedom of religion requires the same
constitutional protections to churches and their officials when
discussing religious doctrine.
   The suit was filed by Leona McNair of Pasadena, former wife of
Raymond McNair, deputy chancellor of the church-run Ambassador
College.
   She was a prominent church member who later became associated
with a dissident faction and was divorced by McNair in 1976 after
20 years of marriage.
   The court said their divorce and McNair's remarriage the next
year prompted criticism within the church, which recognizes divorce
in only a few instances.
   In a 1979 speech to about 1,000 people at the church's annual
meeting in Tucson, Ariz., Roderick Meredith, the church's director
of pastoral administration, sought to explain why the McNair
divorce was justified by ``desertion by an unconverted mate,'' one
of(the grounds recognized by the church.
   Mrs. McNair, he said, ``had left the church and was virtually
cursing (McNair) ... spitting literally in people's faces and as
hateful as a human being can be.''
   ``She departed so far that she is one of the major enemies of
God's church in Southern California,''he said.
   Meredith returned to the subject several months later in a
written report, repeating some of his previous accusations and
saying Mrs. McNair had ``refused to be a wife to (McNair) for over
two years'' before the divorce.
   In the suit against the church, Meredith, McNair and others, a
jury found that the statements were false, and that the pastor's
report had caused Mrs. McNair extreme emotional distress.
   The appeals court overturned the verdict because jury was not
asked to find that the statements were intentionally or recklessly
false.
   ``The right to free exercise of religion is a constitutional
guarantee of equal significance'' to freedom of the press, the
appeals court said, adding that Meredith's remarks, however
personal, ``were made while he was explaining church doctrine'' on
divorce.

<TEXT>
   A missile attack on a tanker in the
Persian Gulf early Friday set the ship on fire, killed one sailor
and critically injured three, shipping executives and hospital
officials said.
   Iran was suspected in the attack on the 4,127-ton Maria II,
which flies the Panamanian flag.
   As many as 19 Korean crewmembers who had jumped off the vessel,
which was laden with highly explosive liquefied gas, were plucked
from the water and from lifeboats by salvage tugboats, the
executives said.
   Hospital officials identified the dead man as a Japanese citizen.
   The tanker was sighted on fire just after midnight in the
southern gulf, about 10 miles from the port of Dubai, said the
sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   They said the fire was put out after about 90 minutes and that
it was apparently the result of an Iranian attack, although they
were unsure whether it was from air or sea.
   Three salvage tugboats that rushed to fight the blaze reported a
hole on the starboard side, indicating the vessel had been hit by a
missile.
   The executives said the dead man's body was found floating in
the water.
   The survivors were taken to Dubai's Al-Rashid Hospital, where
officials said three were in critical condition and six were being
treated for less serious injuries. They said the rest had suffered
minor bruises and were treated and released.
   One hospital official quoted the survivors as saying they had
``thrown themselves overboard once the ship was bombed.'' He said
they were not sure what had struck the ship.
   Iran usually attacks commercial ships in the southern gulf in
retaliation for Iraqi strikes on its own tanker lanes. The two
belligerents, at war since September 1980, have concentrated in
recent weeks on attacking each others cities.
   There had been a lull in the so-called tanker war, except for
two confirmed Iraqi strikes this month. Iranian retaliation is
usually on a ship-for-ship basis. More than 400 ships of different
nationalities have been hit or damaged by both sides.
   The destination of the ship was not immediately known, nor where
it had picked up the shipment.

   The city agreed Thursday to restrict police
in their search for a sexual-assault suspect after the Police
Department was accused in an ACLU suit of detaining hundreds of
black men without cause.
   The agreement, signed by city attorneys and the American Civil
Liberties Union, prohibits officers from detaining anyone merely
because he matches the race or age of the man suspected of
attacking eight women in the past five weeks.
   However, the agreement allows police to stop anyone to seek
their voluntary cooperation in the investigation.
   A similar dispute involving a Police Department dragnet in an
Hispanic neighborhood ended with the city paying a $45,000
settlement to about 80 people in 1985.
   Barry Steinhardt, executive director of the ACLU in
Pennsylvania, applauded the agreement, saying Police Commissioner
Kevin Tucker recognized that the investigation ``should not become
the occasion for the random mass questioning of black
Philadelphians.''
   In the suit filed earlier Thursday, the ACLU sought a federal
court injunction to prevent police ``from stopping, frisking,
questioning and detaining'' black men in the search for the
so-called Center City Stalker.
   The suit, filed on behalf of two men, charges that several
hundred men were questioned without probable cause.
   Attorneys for the ACLU and Deputy City Soliciter Ralph Teti met
Thursday with U.S. District Judge James McGirr Kelly, who approved
the agreement.
   ACLU Legal Director Stefan Presser said: ``We do believe that a
large number of people were illegally detained and we will now
pursue the question of damages.''
   Teti could not be reached for comment Thursday night.
   Earlier in the day, the police commissioner defended the conduct
of the police.
   ``Obviously, our feeling is we have a composite (sketch) and we
feel we're following proper guidelines,'' Tucker said. ``If the
courts think we're doing things differently, then we will abide by
their ruling.''
   The Center City Stalker has generally approached victims leaving
an elevator an empty hall. With a gun, he has directed victims into
an empty room, robbed them, tied their hands hands and ankles and
sexually assaulted them.
   The attacks have created fear among women in downtown office
buildings, leading to an increase in the sale of chemical Mace.
   In 1985, police questioned 125 Hispanics after a police officer
was shot to death in his patrol car in an Hispanic neighborhood.
   A federal judge ordered the department to stop the ``disgraceful
activities'' and ``unlawful conduct'' in rounding up Hispanics
indiscriminately, and the city later agreed to a monetary
settlement.

<HEAD>Smoking Increases Risk Of Stroke In Women</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women who smoke half a pack of cigarettes
a day are twice as likely to have a stroke as women who have never
smoked and those who smoke two packs a day have six times the risk
of a stroke, researchers say.
   Their study, presented Thursday at a meeting of the American
Heart Association, is the first to show a conclusive link between
smoking and strokes in women, said the study's principal author,
Dr. Graham Colditz of the Harvard University School of Medicine in
Boston.
   ``Taken in conjunction with the results for men, this clearly
implicates cigarette smoking as a risk factor for strokes in
women,'' Colditz said.
   Before 1984 smoking was not considered a risk factor for strokes
in men or women. In 1984, however, the American Heart Association
listed cigarette smoking as a possible risk factor for strokes.
   Little has been known about the effect of smoking on strokes in
women, however. Earlier less definitive studies had suggested it
increased the risk, some had found no effect and one had found that
smoking decreased the risk, Colditz said.
   Heart disease and stroke have been studied less extensively in
women than in men, possibly because those diseases are less common
in women than men. But heart disease and stroke, taken together,
are the leading cause of death in women _ as they are in men.
   The heart association estimates that 500,000 Americans have
strokes each year. In 1985, the latest year for which figures are
available, 152,700 Americans died from strokes.
   Colditz said his results are more convincing than those of
previous studies largely because of the number of subjects in his
study _ almost 120,000. They are nurses who were recruited in 1976
for a huge study attempting to correlate various aspects of diet,
health, family history and such things as height and weight with
the occurrence of disease.
   In a separate finding reported Thursday, analysis of the nurses'
drinking habits showed that even modest amounts of alcohol can
lower the risk of coronary heart disease, marked by clogging of the
coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart.
   This effect has been observed in men, but it has not been as
thoroughly studied in women.
   ``A couple of drinks a week is enough to lower the risk,''
Colditz said.
   Meir Stampfer of Harvard, the principal author of the alcohol
study, said analysis of the alcohol intake of 87,566 of the nurses
showed that as little as two drinks a week could lower the risk of
coronary heart disease by 40 percent.
   There is a catch, however. Alcohol has been shown to raise the
incidence of cancer _ and that effect begins to occur with the
consumption of three drinks a week, Colditz said.
   Most authorities believe that the question of alcohol's effect
on health has not been answered well enough yet for them to
recommend that people drink moderately.
   Alcohol's hazards are well known, and public health officials
worry that some people might conclude, for example, that if two
drinks are good, four drinks are better.

   The Army's 15,000-soldier 82nd Airborne
Division is a troubleshooting unit for handling hot spots around
the world.
   ``The division is used as kind of a fire department _ a unit
that can move quickly into an emergency, bring with it the tools
and techniques to put out fires and restore order,'' military
writer Hans Halberstabt said in his 1988 book, ``Airborne: Assault
from the Sky.''
   Here's a brief history of the 82nd Airborne Division:
   _ 1917: The 82nd is activated at Camp Gordon, Ga., but
discontinued in 1919.
   _ 1942: The 82nd is reactivated under Gen. Omar Bradley at Camp
Claiborne, La. The first airborne unit is trained here in
preparation for combat. All five combat airborne divisions, the
82nd, 101st, 11th, 13th and 17th, are trained in the Fort
Bragg-Camp McCall area.
   _ 1943: The division is deployed to North Africa.
   _ July 9, 1943: Paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne Division

   The deadly earthquake that shook the Los
Angeles area in October led scientists to accept a theory that says
the region is more prone to damaging jolts than once believed.
   A study of the quake, published today in the journal Science,
concludes buried faults hidden by folds in Earth's crust present
``additional potential earthquake hazards to the Los Angeles
metropolitan area.''
   The theory by consulting geologist Thom Davis was publicized in
November when scientists met to discuss the Oct. 1 Whittier Narrows
quake, which measured 5.9 on the Richter scale. With its
aftershocks, it caused eight deaths, more than 200 injuries and
$358 million in damage.
   The new study, in which 17 scientists joined Davis as
co-authors, says the hidden fault system running directly under
Dodger Stadium and downtown Los Angeles is ``capable of generating
moderate-sized destructive earthquakes.''
   ``We all sort of knew in the back of our minds that there had to
be (hidden) faults there, but the Whittier Narrows earthquake kind
of brought it home,'' said the study's chief author, University of
Southern California seismologist Egill Hauksson.
   ``Now we can no longer ignore the geologists like Thom Davis who
said these (faults) extend along the whole northern edge of the
(Los Angeles) basin,'' he said.
   The study's co-authors include researchers from the U.S.
Geological Survey, USC, the California Institute of Technology and
the California Division of Mines and Geology.
   While Davis quietly studied the hidden fault hazard, ``nobody
else was even thinking about the problem'' because they focused on
the seismic threat from known, visible faults, said USGS
seismologist Lucile Jones, a co-author of the study and Hauksson's
wife.
   ``When the (Whittier Narrows) earthquake occurred on exactly the
kind of fault he said should be there, we listened more closely,''
she said. ``The idea that a system of faults capable of earthquakes
underlies the northern Los Angeles Basin is becoming generally
accepted.''
   Hauksson said the Whittier Narrows quake was small compared with
quakes that might be generated if the hidden faults are
interconnected and rupture at once. If that happens, ``we're going
to have a much bigger disaster on our hands,'' he said.
   Such a quake could measure up to 7.5 on the Richter scale of
ground motion, Jones said. Previous studies have shown a
magnitude-6.5 in Los Angeles would be more damaging than an
8-magnitude ``great'' quake on the more distant San Andreas Fault.
Officials have said a great quake on the southern San Andreas could
kill up to 14,000 people and cause $17 billion in damage.
   Jones said the hidden system of faults runs west to east from
the Santa Monica Mountains above Malibu through the Beverly and
Hollywood Hills to Dodger Stadium and downtown Los Angeles and then
toward the Whittier area.
   Richard Andrews, the California Office of Emergency Services'
assistant director for Southern California, said the California
Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council met March 11 in Los
Angeles to discuss the study in Science.
   The council was unable to make any recommendations on how the
added hazard should be incorporated into emergency plans, because
not enough is known about how often such quakes will occur or how
strong they will be, Andrews said.

   Prince Charles and eight other members
of Britain's royal family attended a funeral service for Charles'
friend, Maj. Hugh Lindsay, who died in an avalanche that narrowly
missed the prince.
   The 39-year-old heir to the throne read a eulogy in a steady
voice during the service Thursday at the Royal Memorial Chapel on
the grounds of the Royal Military Academy in Sandhurst, west of
London.
   Among the mourners were Lindsay's widow, Sarah, who is six
months pregnant with their first child.
   The 34-year-old career army officer and former aide to Queen
Elizabeth II was skiing with Charles off the main trail at Klosters
in the Swiss Alps on March 10 when an avalanche struck.
   Charles and other members of the party skied clear and escaped
injury, but Lindsay and another friend, Patti Palmer-Tomkinson,
were swept away. Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson survived with broken legs
and lung injuries.

   Jazz trumpeter Miles Davis had to cancel concert
tour stops in Chicago, Detroit and overseas after being
hospitalized for treatment of a leg infection, his publicist said.
   Davis, 62, entered a New York City hospital, whose name was not
disclosed, on March 3 and was expected to remain under treatment
three more weeks, Terrie Williams said Thursday.
   Davis injured the leg in France, second stop on a tour that
began in Italy. Dates in Chicago and Detroit and in Hawaii, New
Zealand and Australia have been canceled, Williams said.
   Davis' condition was unrelated to a hip implant he received
after a car accident in 1975, she said.

   Gov. John McKernan Jr. has become a hunted
man.
   Dozens of amateur photographers have flocked to the governor's
mansion here hoping to get a shot of McKernan walking to his office
at the Capitol as part of a scavenger hunt being sponsored by radio
station WMME-FM.
   The photograph of Maine's chief executive on the hoof is one of
several items needed to win the $1,000 prize in ``The Wild Moose
Hunt.'' Others include a losing state lottery ticket, 92 signatures
from 92 different people and an air-sickness bag from an airline.
   Some shutterbugs have waited up to two hours for the governor to
appear since the contest was announced Tuesday. About 150 people
showed up Thursday.
   ``It wasn't our idea to have a picture in the scavenger hunt to
include me, I can tell you that,'' said McKernan, who slipped out
of the house 20 minutes early one day, prompting 15 late-comers to
march to his office and ask for an impromptu walk.
   By that time, however, he had already left town for the day, his
press secretary said.
   The scavenger hunt ends Saturday, but the governor's office
announced he would give contestants one more chance to snap his
picture between 7:40 a.m. and 8 a.m. today.

   The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee
and two other lawmakers Thursday introduced a resolution to impeach
convicted federal Judge Walter L. Nixon Jr. of Mississippi.
   Judiciary Chairman Peter W. Rodino Jr., D-N.J., acted just two
days after receiving a recommendation from the Judicial Conference,
the governing body for federal judges.
   The conference certified to the House that Nixon had engaged in
conduct which might constitute grounds for impeachment. Judges are
appointed for life, and can only be removed by Congress in an
impeachment proceeding.
   The House votes for impeachment articles, similar to an
indictment, and the Senate then conducts a trial.
   ``My family and I are very upset at this time,'' Nixon said in a
telephone interview from his home in Ocean Springs, Miss. ``Beyond
that, I have no further comment. Any other comments I may have must
come through my attorney.''
   Nixon was convicted in February 1986 of two counts of perjury
before a federal grand jury. He had been acquitted of bribery
charges by a federal jury regarding his business relationship with
Wiley Fairchild, a wealthy investor who sold three oil well
properties to Nixon in 1980 at bargain prices.
   But the grand jury convicted him of lying when he denied
discussing drug charges against Fairchild's son with the elder
Fairchild and with a Mississippi prosecutor.
   The Supreme Court last Jan. 19 refused to review the conviction.
Nixon is scheduled to go to prison next Wednesday.
   Nixon, the chief judge for the Southern District of Mississippi,
said on Jan. 20 he would not resign. He stopped hearing cases after
he was indicted, but continues to draw his annual judicial salary
of $89,500.
   Sponsoring the resolution in addition to Rodino were Reps. Don
Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of the Judiciary subcommittee on civil
rights; Hamilton Fish of New York, ranking Republican on the full
committee; and Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., R-Wis.
   Rodino said, ``In view of the fact that Judge Nixon has been
convicted of a serioius federal crime, and his direct judicial
appeals have been exhausted, it becomes incumbent upon the House of
Representatives to initiate impeachment proceedings.''
   The last impeachment was about 18 months ago, when the Senate
convicted and removed U.S. District Judge Harry E. Claiborne of
Nevada.

<HEAD>Report Says Illegal Aliens Depress Wages for Americans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Illegal aliens are depressing wages and
worsening working conditions for legal immigrants and native
Americans in low-skilled and low-wage jobs, the General Accounting
Office says in a new report.
   Citing empirical data and several case studies, the
congressional watchdog agency said both U.S.-born and legally
documented immigrants are being hurt, especially those working as
janitors and farm and food processing workers.
   The report identified restaurants and companies producing auto
parts, shoes and clothing as others that often employ illegal
aliens.
   The willingness of illegal aliens to work in low-skill jobs for
less than the minimum wage in those industries has depressed wages
and benefits for comparable native and legal immigrant workers, the
GAO said.
   But it also concluded that the low wages paid to illegal aliens
allow some of the businesses to grow or survive foreign
competition, indirectly expanding job opportunities and wages for
higher-skilled workers in the same trades.
   Without a pool of flexible illegal immigrants willing to work at
sewing machines in high-fashion garment plants or as shoemakers,
the GAO said, many companies would shut down or move out of the
country.
   It also said a growing practice by restaurants of using illegal
immigrants as dishwashers and busboys allowed the businesses to
keep their prices low and thus expand, providing more jobs for more
highly skilled waiters and chefs.
   The Labor Department disagrees with those conclusions, saying
none of the studies surveyed by GAO offered any concrete evidence
of a positive effect from using illegal workers. It said the only
evidence came in comments from employers.
   In a formal reply to the report, the department also disputed
GAO's premise that legal workers won't take many of the low-wage
jobs, particularly in the shoe and garment industries.
   ``The fact is that large numbers of native and legal U.S.
workers are in the same labor market as illegal workers,'' the
Labor Department said. ``Furthermore, if wages were not depressed
by illegal workers, even greater numbers of native and legal
workers would be in that labor market.''
   The GAO said the 1986 immigration reform law and its fines for
hiring illegal aliens, if successful, will force wages up for legal
immigrants and natives and cause ``considerable stress''
financially for growers and shoe and garment manufacturers.
   Congress asked the GAO to survey all available studies and data
on illegal immigrants' impact on native and legal immigrant workers
in 1985, when it was weighing the employer sanctions that were
adopted a year later.
   The GAO has now finally submitted the study to Congress, saying
that after examining 230 academic and other treatises on the issue,
it found scarce useful information. The biggest problem, the GAO
said, is that illegal aliens are a hidden population, making it
hard to identify them for use in any empirical study.
   About two dozen case studies, however, suggested that employers'
use of illegal aliens has displaced native workers and legal
immigrants from their jobs and driven down wages of those who
remain.
   The most dramatic examples were among janitors and farm and food
processing workers in California.
   For example, janitors in downtown Los Angeles office buildings _
most of them black or legal Hispanic immigrants _ had won wage and
benefits reaching a peak of $12 an hour by 1983 under labor
contracts negotiated by the Service Employees International Union.
   However, in the 1980s a group of aggressive non-union janitorial
services hiring predominantly illegal immigrants began wresting the
best building contracts away from the unionized firms, driving the
union scale back down to $4 an hour and below.
   Of 2,500 black janitors working under high-wage contracts in
1977, only 100 still enjoyed comparative wages by 1985. The union
still had 600 working members but 500 of them had suffered large
pay cuts.
   Similar events occurred in the southern California citrus and
tomato fields, where farm labor contractors using illegal
immigrants drove down wage and benefits of legal migrant crop
pickers from Mexico by 18 percent between 1975 and 1985.

<HEAD>Department Says Movie Overlooks School Lunch Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department thinks its
40-year-old National School Lunch Program should have had at least
a walk-on role in a forthcoming NBC television movie about hunger
among children.
   As it is, the network's hour-long movie, ``A Place at the
Table,'' will be broadcast the night of March 20 without mention of
the school lunch program. Department officials are giving the movie
less than rave reviews.
   Curt Block, NBC vice president for media relations, said the
purpose of the film's producers ``was to take a broader focus of
the problem of hunger'' among children and to ``get across to the
public how pervasive the problem is.''
   Block said the intent was also to show that ``there are a number
of ways we can get food to children.''
   Assistant Secretary John W. Bode, who oversees school lunch and
food stamp programs, said in a statement that ``despite the
laudable public service aspects of the movie, it contains serious
inaccuracies'' about hunger.
   ``In the movie, children are encouraged to donate their brown
bag lunches to classmates who are so hungry they attend a soup
kitchen after school,'' Bode said. ``The film does not acknowledge
the existence of the National School Lunch Program, which provides
free school lunches to children of low-income families.''
   Further, he said, preschool breakfasts are also provided in
schools which participate in the USDA program.
   ``School lunch is only one of a number of federal food
assistance programs, including food stamps, which provide more than
$20 billion worth of help a year to needy Americans,'' Bode said.
``That figure translates into $56 million a day in food help.''
   Further, he said, the school lunch program is one of the largest
food service providers in the country, serving more than 24 million
children daily, nearly half of whom receive lunches free of charge.
   Since 1980, the federal budget for school lunches has increased
21 percent to the current annual level of $3.4 billion, Bode said.
   According to USDA budget officers, about $3 billion in cash
subsidies will go to schools to help with lunch programs in the
fiscal year that began last Oct. 1. An additional $400 million in
surplus food commodities also is being distributed.
   Students from families with income of less than 130 percent of
the federal poverty line ($14,560 for a family of four) qualify for
free meals. The USDA pays a subsidy of about $1.54 per meal for
those. About 10.3 million students are in that category.
   Reduced-price meals costing no more than 40 cents are available
to about 1.6 million students from families with incomes between
130 percent and 185 percent of the poverty level (between $14,560
and $20,720 for a family of four). The USDA subsidy is about $1.14
per meal. About 1.64 million students participate.
   Full prices are paid by student from families above 185 percent
of poverty (those with incomes of more than $20,720 for a family of
four). Nearly 12.8 million children pay full prices, but those
meals are also subsidized by USDA at the rate of about 26 cents per
meal.

   Farmers are continuing to make a strong
financial comeback from the pounding they endured in the early
1980s, according to a new Agriculture Department report.
   Cash income still is expected to recede from last year's $57
billion to between $50 billion and $55 billion in 1988, the
department's Economic Research Service said Thursday.
   The projected decline will result from lower livestock receipts,
rising expenses and lower government payments, the report said.
Those will more than offset a rise in 1988 crop receipts.
   Net cash income is the difference between gross cash income and
cash expenses in the calendar year.
   ``The income and debt-service problems that plagued agriculture
during the 1980s have largely been weathered, although financial
problems persist for some producers who acquired long-term debt at
high interest rates,'' the report said. ``A major contributor to
increased cash flow is a marked reduction in interest expenses
since the difficult 1980-83 years.''
   Economists said receipts from crop sales are improving as a
result of increased domestic and export demand for major
commodities, including wheat and corn.
   ``Receipts from livestock sales should be off slightly, as red
meat and poultry production expands almost 2 percent and prices
falter,'' the report said. ``Fruit prices this spring will be below
a year ago as larger supplies come to market.''

   Consumers can bite into some bargains at fresh
fruit counters these days, says a senior Agriculture Department
official.
   J. Patrick Boyle, head of the department's Agricultural
Marketing Service, said large harvests of apples and winter pears
have helped dampen prices. The leading variety of U.S. apple is the
Red Delicious, and the most abundant winter pear is the Anjou, he
said.
   The agency estimated that the 1987 apple harvest was up 25
percent, while winter pear output climbed 21 percent.
   ``Barring unexpected developments, consumers will continue to
find apples and winter pears of excellent quality at attractive
prices in their grocery stores for several more months,'' Boyle
said Thursday.

   The first step in bailing out Texas' largest
bank holding company is raising concerns about the long-term health
of the fund that insures deposits in most of the nation's
commerical banks.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said Thursday it was loaning
$1 billion to banks owned by First RepublicBank Corp. of Dallas for
six months in a move to reassure depositors worried about the
banks' shaky real estate loans.
   The infusion represents only about 5 percent of the FDIC's
insurance fund, which backs deposits of $100,000 and less at 13,600
banks. But bank analysts believe it could turn out to be the first
big hit of a bad year for the fund.
   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman isn't saying how much he
believes his agency ultimately may have to spend to rescue the
$33.2 billion holding company, the largest in Texas and the 13th
biggest in the country.
   The analysts, however, are suggesting that the First
RepublicBank loan is, in effect, a down payment on a $2 billion to
$4 billion problem.
   First RepublicBank is about the same size that Continental
Illinois Corp. was in 1984 when it required the largest-ever
government bank bailout of $4.5 billion.
   And more bad news is likely from other banks, particularly in
Texas, where Mcorp, a $21 billion, money-losing bank holding
company, has been exploring restructuring options.
   But Seidman says the situations of Continental and First
RepublicBank are not the same and he points with hope to FDIC
conversations with private investors and to signs that Texas'
economy is rebounding.
   He notes his fund's survival during 1987, the worst year for
commercial banking since the Great Depression, both in terms of low
profits and the number of bank failures.
   Despite the rescue of First City Bancorporation of Houston and
the failure of 184 banks in 1987, the FDIC fund still managed a
modest increase to $18.3 billion.
   ``Therefore, we don't see anything that we are going to do this
year that is going to cause a substantial decline in the fund. I
mean by substantial, 25 percent,'' he said.
   However, Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va., financial consultant,
said, ``My sense is they are going to lose money.''
   The fund's income from interest and from premiums paid by member
banks _ $3.3 billion last year _ is increasing at a slower rate
than deposits, he said. The ratio of FDIC assets to insured
deposits has fallen from more than $1.20 per $100 in 1981 to close
to $1.10.
   Still, the FDIC fund is in far better shape than its sister fund
for the thrift industry, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance
Corp. Unlike FSLIC, the FDIC probably would still be in the black
after accounting for all of the problems suffered by its member
institutions, Ely said.
   Industry experts are skeptical of the chances for FDIC's efforts
to attract private investors to take on some of the risks of
operating a restructured First RepublicBank.
   ``I'm sure there probably are people who are kicking the tires
and have expressed an interest to the FDIC,'' said Stephen Skaggs,
a senior analyst for Sheshunoff & Co., an Austin, Texas, consulting
firm.
   ``But I just don't see that there's any great appetite for
investments (like First RepublicBank) unless the FDIC is willing to
assume substantially all of the risk.''
   According to Sandy Flannigan, an analyst with Paine Webber Inc.
in Houston, the search for private capital for First RepublicBank
does not improve the chances for other Texas banks such as Mcorp to
attract new investors.
   First City, which is getting $500 million from a private
investment group in addition to the FDIC money, ``was first to the
well,'' she said. ``They are in far better shape than those who
follow. There isn't an infinite number of investors interested in
Texas banks.''
   Ironically, the deepening bank crisis comes amid signs that
Texas' economy is improving.
   ``The whole thing is just a very sad situation,'' said Paul
Getman, senior financial economist of The Wefa Group, a
Philadelphia-area consulting firm. ``Just when people thought the
situation in Texas might turn around, it has in fact worsened. ...
The overall economic situation ... has picked up a bit, it has just
not improved fast enough to help these banks. ... It's just too
little too late.''
   ``The scary thing ... is that if right now these banks are doing
so poorly with an economy that is doing fairly well nationally,
what will happen to them if the national growth turns sluggish for
the next few years?'' he asked.

   Two unidentified jets from
Honduras roared into Nicaraguan territory on Thursday and dropped
bombs near a Sandinista military encampment along the border.
   Two bombs fell in Nicaragua and a third landed across the Coco
River in Honduran territory, Sandinista officers said. There was no
damage or injuries.
   The raid came a day after Honduras accused Nicaragua of sending
thousands of soldiers across the border in pursuit of
U.S.-supported Contra rebels.
   A Honduran armed forces spokesman in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran
capital, said the bombs were aimed at Sandinista forces that
crossed into the neighboring country. He denied the planes entered
Nicaraguan airspace.
   More than 3,000 American soldiers began arriving in Honduras in
a show of support Thursday. Ortega declared his army ready to
``combat and liquidate'' the Americans and said his soldiers will
not withdraw from the border region.
   Nicaragua has committed an estimated 6,000 soldiers to an
anti-rebel operation in an area running from the central region to
the border, with most at the frontier.
   About 25 reporters, most of them Americans, watched as the jets
roared into Nicaragua at about noon Thursday. The journalists dived
for cover but were not hurt as the bombs exploded as close as 70
yards away.
   The leftist Sandinista government flew the journalists to the
region for a briefing on its offensive against the U.S.-supported
Contra rebels.
   None of the five Soviet-made helicopters used in the area for
movement of troops or evacuation were hit by the bombs. In
Washington, sources who spoke on condition of anonymity claimed
that one Soviet-made helicopter on the ground had been damaged. The
Soviet Union supplies the Sandinistas with military hardware and
training.
   The Sandinistas opened fire at the planes with anti-aircraft
guns but apparently did not hit either of them.
   Some military officials in Nicaragua described the planes as
French-made Mysteres, while others said they were U.S.-made F-5s.
The Honduran air force has both.
   A U.S. official in Washington said two U.S.-built F-5s and four
Super-Mystere attack jets of the Honduran air force carried out the
raid.
   ``This was totally a Honduran operation,'' the official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Upon hearing of the raid, Ortega abruptly left a meeting with
opposition politicians called to discuss their differences with the
government. A presidential source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Ortega held an urgent meeting with his military
chiefs.
   Later, Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto said he had sent a
diplomatic note to Secretary of State George P. Shultz ``formally
and energetically protesting'' the attack, which he blamed on the
United States.
   The government Voice of Nicaragua radio also said Thursday that
unidentified planes from Honduras buzzed Corinto, Nicaragua's main
port, and anti-aircraft batteries fired on them.
   The broadcast gave no details. Corinto is on the Pacific, about
70 miles northwest of Managua.
   Honduras has one of Central America's smallest armies and relies
on air superiority for defense. It and Mexico are the only nations
in the region with jet fighters.
   Ortega called the dispatch of U.S. troops to Honduras ``one more
escalation of the war against Nicaragua.'' At Nicaragua's request,
the U.N. Security Council will meet in urgent session Friday on the
Nicaraguan-Honduran border crisis and on the dispatch of U.S.
troops to Honduras.
   In Managua, Ortega said: ``We logically are going to maintain
our offensive. ... We are not going to withdraw our troops now that
we have recovered our territory.
   ``We are ready to combat and liquidate the famous forces of the
82nd Airborne Division.''
   Earlier, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Nicaragua already had
begun withdrawing troops from the border region after driving about
2,000 Contra rebels back into Honduras.
   ``The operations have succesfully been concluded, and we don't
plan to stay along the border region,'' the spokesman, Alejandro
Bendana, said on NBC's ``Today'' show.
   The 3,200 U.S. soldiers who began arriving in Honduras on
Thursday include two battalions from the 82nd Airborne at Fort
Bragg, N.C.
   Ortega accused the United States of pressuring Honduras into
asking for the American presence.
   The C-141 planes carrying the U.S. troops were arriving every 30
minutes at Palmerola air force base, the main center of U.S.
military operations in Honduras. The base is about 125 miles west
of the border, where heavy fighting was reported Wednesday.
   Bendana denied U.S. and Honduran allegations that Sandinista
troops entered Honduras. Ortega himself wouldn't say if Sandinista
troops crossed the border.
   But Honduran military officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said about 4,000 Honduran soldiers were surrounding
about 2,000 Nicaraguan soldiers Thursday. The sources said the
entire Honduran military was on alert.
   Ortega told reporters the Nicaraguan ``invasion only exists in
the warped imagination of the North American leaders.''
   ``We demand that the United States withdraw its troops from
Honduras immediately and, with this, contribute to the meeting that
is going to be held in Sapoa March 21 having positive results,'' he
said.
   Government and Contra representatives are scheduled to begin
three days of peace talks Monday in Sapoa, a town in southern
Nicaragua near the border with Costa Rica.
   Ortega said the United States would use the current situation to
give the Contras logistical and military aid not approved by
Congress.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar called for
restraint in the conflict but had not decided whether to send in an
observer team.

   Nicaraguan officials
apparently wanted to show reporters how quiet this jungle-covered
border region was when they flew them here Thursday, following a
major offensive against Contra rebels.
   But as officials were briefing about 25 journalists at a
military base, two unidentified jet planes from Honduras roared
into Nicaraguan territory and dropped bombs along the border.
   The reporters dived into the dirt for cover. No one was hurt.
   Some military officials in Nicaragua described the planes as
French-made Mysteres, while others said they were U.S.-made F-5s.
The Honduran air force has both.
   The bombs landed along the Coco River, which marks the border
between the two countries. Puffs of black smoke curled over the
banana trees.
   Lt. Col. Javier Carrion, the deputy chief of the Sandinista
army's general staff, said two bombs landed in Nicaraguan territory
and one in Honduras.
   The journalists' briefing came after Reagan administration
officials had claimed that Nicaraguan troops had penetrated
Honduran territory in pursuit of the U.S.-backed rebels. Nicaragua
and Honduras share a long, ill defined border.
   As the jets roared in Thursday, drowning out the lapping of the
slow-moving river and the chirping of crickets, journalists and
soldiers threw themselves against the earth.
   Some of the bombs exploded about 70 yards away from where they
lay.
   Maj. Rosa Pasos, the Defense Ministry spokeswoman, lost her
eyeglasses in the weeds but quickly found them. She wore an
American-made uniform that had apparently been taken from a Contra
rebel.
   The Sandinistas opened fire at the planes with anti-aircraft
guns. They apparently didn't hit either of them.
   None of the five Soviet-made helicopters used in this area 175
miles from Managua was hit. In Washington, sources who spoke on
condition of anonymity claimed that one Soviet-made helicopter on
the ground had been damaged. The Soviet Union supplies the
Sandinistas with military hardware and training.
   Carrion, who had been conducting the offensive against the
Contras, said that jets had buzzed the Coco River earlier in the
day.
   Asked whether Sandinista troops had crossed the border in their
offensive, Carrion replied, ``Well, no.''
   ``There are sectors in the mountains here where you can get
lost. It's easy to confuse the topography.''
   However, Carrion displayed a map showing where Sandinista troops
had destroyed Contra camps along a six-mile route on both sides of
the Coco River.
   Thursday's attack came hours after 3,200 American troops arrived
in Honduras in a show of force.
   Nicaraguan officers said the air attack appeared to be aimed at
harassing the Sandinistas.

<HEAD>Potatoes and Plywood: Home State Concerns Dominate Trade Session</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senators are pressing the Reagan
administration with a host of worries about how plywood, potatoes
and other home-state products would fare under the U.S. and
Canadian agreement to phase out tariffs.
   The outpouring of concern came Thursday at a Senate Finance
Committee session with Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III and
U.S. Trade Representative Clayton K. Yeutter.
   Dropping potato tariffs under the plan will magnify the
importance of Canadian potato subsidies and a Canadian ban on Maine
potatoes, declared Sen. George J. Mitchell, D-Maine.
   ``Will you gentlemen explain to me and Maine potato farmers why
this agreement is good for them?'' Mitchell said.
   ``Before I fully support a free-trade agreement, I must make
sure that it will not hurt coal,'' said Sen. Jay Rockefeller,
D-W.Va.
   ``We're being moved out of their markets'' even without the
agreement, said Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn. ``And it is wheat,
and it is potatoes and it is corn.''
   Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., said that of the nation's
$13 billion trade deficit with Canada last year ``nearly half of
that is in auto and truck activity.''
   ``I must say to you that I have very serious reservations about
that section of the treaty,'' Riegle said.
   Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, told the
administration officials that they must not merely dismiss the
questions as narrow concerns that skirt the big picture.
   Baker declared that the agreement ``is in the national economic
interest or we wouldn't have sent it up here for approval.''
   ``It is unlikely that we'll ever negotiate a utopian
agreement,'' Yeutter said.
   Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., called for approval of the
U.S.-Canada treaty, but he expressed concern that Canada already
has violated the agreement by failing to retest U.S. plywood that
Canada says cracks in extreme cold.
   ``They're used in Nome, they're used on the North Slope (in
Alaska),'' he said. ``They don't crack where they're used.''
   And Bentsen expressed impatience when Yeutter said energy
provisions of the agreement will be valuable to the United States
``in the long run.''
   The oil-state senator, who has been concerned about sagging
petroleum prices, replied that ``in the long run we'll all be
dead.''
   ``I'm concerned about what's happening while we're all still
around here,'' Bentsen said. ``I have a state that's in a
depression.''

   With some of the most expensive campaign
states coming up, the presidential candidates are pressing
fund-raising appeals anew and only George Bush is out of the
financial woods.
   After costly excursions into the 20 Super Tuesday states on
March 8, the candidates now face money-draining states like New
York, Pennsylvania, California and Ohio.
   Bush has almost finished raising as much money as he can legally
spend, and still has more than $4 million available to spend at
this time, a spokeswoman said. GOP rival Pat Robertson has spent
nearly to the $27 million limit and has to dramatically scale back
his campaign.
   Among Democrats, Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois and Rep. Richard
Gephardt of Missouri both are looking for enough cash to keep their
campaigns afloat beyond caucuses on March 26 in Michigan and
primaries March 29 in Connecticut and April 5 in Wisconsin.
   The Democratic money leader, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis,
has an active April fund-raising schedule, and remains in good
financial shape, his campaign said.
   Democrat Jesse Jackson, whose fund-raising has trailed that of
opponents, has been picking up money through an aggressive mail
program, and will appeal for money in California this weekend.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr.'s campaign is ``in the black'' and has ``a
sufficient amount of money to do what we need to do,'' said
spokesman Arlie Schardt.
   ``We're in good solid shape,'' Schardt said, but declined to
give any specifics. Gore borrowed heavily for pre-Super Tuesday TV
ads.
   Bush plans to shut down his fund-raising operation by the end of
April, after a handful of high-ticket dinners and one final mailing
to his faithful contributors, said campaign treasurer Fred Bush,
who is no relation to the candidate.
   At that point Bush will have raised the $27 million, plus
another $2 million or so for legal and accounting costs, which are
exempt from the limit. However, he has not spent the limit, so he
can continue campaigning.
   As Bush continues the road to all-but-certain nomination this
summer, people are flocking to give him money and two dozen had to
be refused tickets to a $1,000-a-person dinner at a private home
this week, the treasurer said.
   Robertson is in a different situation, having spent nearly the
limit. He says he will rely heavily on volunteer efforts to see him
through the rest of the campaign.
   Sen. Bob Dole's spokeswoman, Dale Tate, said the Kansas
Republican's poor showing on Super Tuesday and in Illinois did not
result in a dramatic decrease of contributions, although, ``We're
not bathing in dollars.''
   Conversely, contributors have been calling to urge Dole to stay
in the race, she said.
   On Friday, callers pledged $140,000, on Monday $95,000 and on
Tuesday $60,000, she said, adding, ``These are Republicans saying
we think there should be a race.''
   Dukakis spokesman Mark Gearan said the campaign raised $100,000
Wednesday night in New York, and is getting financial mileage out
of the candidate's strong Super Tuesday showing.
   Dukakis has about $1.5 million in the bank, not counting the
more than $600,000 he got this week in federal matching funds, said
spokesman Leslie Dach.
   Simon and Gephardt, who face uphill struggles in fund-raising
after their poor Super Tuesday showings, both said they are out of
debt at this point.
   Both also said they had record fund-raising months in February _
Gephardt collecting $1.2 million and Simon more than $900,000.
   And Gephardt spokesman Mark Johnson said, ``It's a day-to-day
thing.'' He said the campaign was aggressively seeking money, and
Gephardt was putting in personal calls to contributors.
   Gephardt is targeting Michigan for a heavy advertising campaign,
but Johnson said he has no idea whether any loans will be taken out.
   Simon spokesman David Carle said the campaign, which has scaled
back its payroll and operations, had around $300,000 in cash on
hand.
   Simon collected about $60,000 at a Chicago event Monday night,
and expected to bring in another $25,000 Thursday night in New
York, he said.
   A mailing to Simon's 50,000 contributors will go out next week,
and unsolicited donations came in following Simon's victory in his
home state of Illinois, Carle said. He declined to give specific
figures.
   Simon will strongly contest Wisconsin with a large television
campaign, but will not buy ads in Michigan, he said.

<HEAD>Highway Deaths Down Significantly in 1987</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Traffic fatalities in the United States last
year were the ``lowest in history'' based on miles driven,
according to the Department of Transportation.
   The department reported on Thursday that fatalities dropped
significantly in 1987 and attributed the decline to increasing use
of seat belts and a reduction in drunken driving.
   The department said its characterization of the 1987 fatality
rate as the lowest in history used as a yardstick the number of
deaths per 100 million miles of travel. For 1987 that figure was
2.4 deaths. The highest number was the 24.08 deaths per 100 million
miles in 1921, the first year the calculation was made.
   The department's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
also released figures estimating that 8,035 lives were saved and
95,500 injuries prevented by seat belts since 1983.
   The rate of deaths per 100 million miles of travel dropped from
2.5 in 1986 and 3.3 in 1980. About 40 percent of the fatalities
last year involved drunken driving, a drop from the 46 percent
three years earlier.
   The department said 32 states and the District of Columbia have
mandatory seat belt laws and estimated 1,350 lives were saved in
1987 alone because of the laws in effect.

<HEAD>137 Killed, Jetliner Crashes Into Mountain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CUCUTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Avianca jetliner smashed into a
mountain minutes after takeoff, triggered a landslide and burst
into flames, killing all 137 people aboard, officials and witnesses
said.
   Among the 131 passengers were a Roman Catholic auxiliary bishop
and more than 30 soccer players, officials said. There were no
Americans aboard, they said.
   The Boeing 727 clipped trees before hitting the snow-covered
mountain 50 miles away near Zulia, witnesses said.
   The craft took off in heavy fog at 1:16 p.m. Thursday from
Cucuta, 250 miles northeast of Bogota, on a domestic flight to the
Caribbean port of Barranquilla.
   Rescue workers who reached the wreckage Thursday night said
there were no survivors, Col. Miguel Benedetti, civil defense
director for the state of North Santander, said in a interview by
radio-telephone from Zulia.
   ``The impact of the plane against the mountain was so violent
that it caused a landslide which buried part of the aircraft,''
said Benedetti.
   Work crews, some using helicopters, were to return to the crash
site today, said Col. Edgar Lozano, spokesman for the Civil
Aeronautics Agency. Rain, snow and rough terrain hampered rescue
efforts Thursday.
   Airport officials lost radio contact with the plane four minutes
after it took off, although no problems had been reported up to
that point, said Lozano.
   Lozano said the plane apparently was unable to get enough
altitude to fly over the 8,000-foot mountain.
   Zulia police said three witnesses reported that the plane
clipped some trees, then slammed into the mountain and burst into
flames.
   ``We heard a tremendous noise ... and ran toward the mountain
where we saw the ruins of the plane,'' said Victor Pineda
Villamizar, a schoolteacher, in an interview with the radio network
RCN.
   He said local rescuers could not reach the crash site because of
the rough terrain.
   Avianca and the government air agency reported the plane was
carrying 131 passengers and six crew members. They both had had
given different numbers earlier.
   The agency said the passenger list included Monsignor Horacio
Olave Velandia, 44, who was named auxiliary bishop of Tibu in
February, and at least 31 soccer players from two teams who were
flying to a tournament in Cartagena.
   The soccer teams were affiliated with the state petroleum
company Ecopetrol.
   Colombia's last major air crash occurred July 27, 1985, when an
air force transport plane went down in the Amazon jungle, killing
74 people. The military plane was carrying civilian passengers
because of an airline strike.

<HEAD>Contra Leader: Peace Talks Off Unless Sandinistas Leave Honduras</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peace talks scheduled to begin Monday between the
Contra rebels and the Nicaraguan government are off unless
Sandinista troops withdraw from Honduras, a Contra leader says.
   ``If this situation does not take a radical turn, we will not
attend,'' Aristides Sanchez, a member of the five-person
directorate of the Nicaraguan Resistance, said Thursday. The group
has its headquarters in Miami.
   Sanchez said the Contras would attend the meeting only if the
Sandinistas withdraw at once from Honduras. ``There could be
changes in the next four days, but I doubt they will be positive,''
he said.
   Nicaraguan government officials maintain their troops didn't
advance into Honduras, but the Reagan administration claims they
did and dispatched 3,200 American soldiers to Honduras because of
their presence.
   The Sandinista government of Daniel Ortega and Contra
representatives are scheduled to begin three days of talks Monday
in Sapoa, a town in southern Nicaragua near the border with Costa
Rica.
   If Monday's meeting is held, it will be the first on Nicaraguan
soil between the two sides.
   A Contra spokeswoman in Miami said intense fighting continued
Thursday with 2,000 Sandinista troops still in Honduras.
   ``The intention of the Sandinistas was to weaken our position at
the negotiating table,'' Marta Sacasa said. ``It's also timed to
coincide with the end of United States aid.''
   Preliminary reports indicated 10 Contra rebels were killed and
56 wounded in the Sandinista offensive, she said.
   ``They have been able to overrun certain of our positions and we
have had to disperse,'' Ms. Sacasa said. ``We're trying to avoid a
frontal engagement and rely on guerrilla tactics.''
   Contra leaders had no comment on the American troops airlifted
to Honduras in a show of support for the Central American nation,
Ms. Sacasa said.
   ``The United States troops did not go to Honduras to involve
themselves with the fighting in any way, so we have no comment,''
she said.

   The U.S. dollar rose sharply and stock prices
continued to rally Friday as traders in Tokyo reacted to favorable
economic reports.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues finished the day's trading at 25,966.26 points, up
93.97 points, or 0.36 percent, from Thusday's closing figure.
   The dollar closed at 128.35 yen, up 0.92 yen from Thursday's
close, but down from its 128.65-yen opening.
   ``The opening jump was in reaction to sharp rises in the dollar
recorded on the New York and London markets due to the U.S. trade
figures,'' said a foreign exchange dealer, who requested anonymity,
with a major bank.
   Another dealer, who also asked not to be named, said the dollar
later receded because of selling pressure from exporters and
insurance companies.
   Figures released Thursday in Washington by the U.S. Commerce
Department indicated the U.S. trade deficit for January rose to
$12.44 billion from $12.2 billion the previous month. But although
the gap widened by 1.9 percent, imports to the United States
declined by 6 percent during the month.
   Improvements in the U.S. trade deficit reduce the pressure for a
weaker dollar, which has been a key weapon in the Reagan
administration's attempts to narrow the imbalance.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average index of
225 selected issues closed the morning session at 25,911.10 points,
up 38.81 from Thursday's close. Volume in the first section was
estimated at 750 million shares.
   The early gains on the Nikkei average followed three consecutive
closing rallies that brought the index to a level higher than that
just prior to the October crash.

<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir urged
American Jews to close ranks behind Israel as it tries to quell
riots by Palestinians in the occupied territories of the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip.
   ``When unity breaks down, then our enemies exploit every
critical statement to their own end,'' Shamir said to enthusiastic
applause from 1,600 American Jews at a fund-raising banquet on
Thursday.
   He apparently referred to criticism by some Jews of the Israeli
Army's use of beatings and live ammunition to quell riots in the
occupied territories. At least 100 Palestinians have been killed in
more than three months of violence.
   Shamir also warned Israel's supporters not to compare the
Palestinian protests to a civil rights struggle.
   ``These are not passive civil rights marches. These are another
expression of the Arab refusal to accept Israel, to coexist with
us, and to recognize that Israel is a permanent feature in the
region,'' Shamir said.
   ``If there were some excesses, they were isolated cases that
were blown way out of proportion by the media,'' he added.
   Those attending the $60-a-plate benefit at the Century Plaza
Hotel agreed to pledge at least $1,000 to either the United Jewish
Fund or Israel Bonds during the coming year.
   Earlier Thursday, at a ceremony dedicating a cornerstone for a
museum commemorating the Holocaust, Shamir told about 1,500 people
that Americans and Europeans may wrongly interpret the Arab
rebellion.
   ``They cry, `Palestine is Arab,' and openly declare that all of
Palestine is theirs,'' he said.
   Shamir also was scheduled to address a luncheon meeting today of
the Los Angeles World Affairs Council. He is scheduled to leave Los
Angeles on Saturday evening.
   The prime minister, fresh from his meeting with President
Reagan, Secretary of State George P. Shultz, and congressional
leaders in Washington, reiterated his opposition to an American
plan for peace in the Middle East that calls for an international
conference.

   President Reagan toasted ``Seamus Wright''
among other adversaries during a Capitol Hill luncheon after paying
a surprise visit to a tavern in a celebration of St. Patrick's Day.
   Standing Thursday at a table covered with a green cloth and
decorated with green carnations, the president wished House Speaker
Jim Wright ``warm words on a cold evening and a full moon on a dark
night.''
   Wright, who wore a green jacket and green tie, declared that
``we've buried all differences that might exist between political
parties and branches of government on this day of St. Patrick.'' He
toasted Reagan, 77, for his youthfulness.
   Wright's great-grandmother, Grace Hannington, emigrated from
County Dungannon, Ireland, in 1837. The Irish for James is Seamus.
   Reagan traces his Irish roots to his great-great-grandfather,
Michael O'Regan, who left County Tipperary during the potato famine
of the 1840s.
   Before he arrived at the Capitol, Reagan paid a surprise visit
to Ireland's Own, a noisy pub in suburban Alexandria, Va., where he
sipped beer and sampled corned beef and cabbage with columnist
James J. Kilpatrick.
   The president, a moderate drinker, left most of the beer in his
glass, but joined the tavern crowd in singing ``When Irish Eyes Are
Smiling,'' and clapping to guitar and fiddle music.
   Reagan, who like most presidents is seldom seen handling money,
reached in his pocket for some currency and paid his own check when
he left.
   On a more serious note, Reagan issued a statement urging
concerned Americans to refuse financial or moral support to Irish
terrorists.
   ``Northern Ireland continues to suffer from senseless violence,
which tragically we have seen repeated in recent days, and high
unemployment,'' he said.
   ``We can best address these problems by supporting those who
seek peaceful settlements to disputes, and rejecting those who seek
solutions through terror.''
   Meantime, members of Congress commemorating St. Patrick's Day
said Britain's refusal to prosecute certain cases of criminal
conduct by its forces in Northern Ireland is ``intolerable'' and
tarnishes Britain's international reputation.
   ``We call on the British government to prosecute any member of
the security forces who has engaged in criminal conduct in Northern
Ireland,'' said a statement issued by Friends of Ireland in
Congress, a 160-member bipartisan group.
   ``It is intolerable not to pursue and bring to justice
individuals known to have perverted justice.''
   The statement did not mention a recent string of violent
incidents that started March 6 when British troops in Gibraltar
killed three unarmed Irish Republican Army guerrillas who allegedly
were on a bombing mission.
   Another congressional group, the Ad Hoc Congressional Committee
for Irish Affairs, which includes 41 House and Senate members from
both parties, called for a new investigation of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, the British police force in Northern Ireland.
   Both groups urged Britain to enact laws to help stop
discrimination against the Roman Catholic minority in Northern
Ireland that has resulted in jobless rates of more than 50 percent
among Catholic men in some areas.

<HEAD>Democratic Caucuses Set Saturday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Democratic presidential hopefuls _ who
also are the leaders in the national delegate race _ were
campaigning in Kansas, which holds county caucuses on Saturday.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson were
campaigning today in the state, a day after a foray by Tennessee
Sen. Albert Gore Jr.
   At Saturday's caucuses, local delegates will be elected to
district conventions April 23 and the state convention May 2. At
the district and state conventions, 39 of Kansas' 43 national
delegates to the Democratic convention in Atlanta in July will be
elected.
   The candidates who win the most local delegates Saturday will
claim the national delegates at the later conventions. Four state
party leaders automatically are national delegates.
   Gore, the first of the Democratic contenders to come to Kansas
ahead of the caucuses, scored something of a coup Thursday when he
was invited to address the state House of Representatives and
gained a qualified endorsement from state Democratic Party Chairman
Jim Parrish.
   Dukakis was speaking at a rally in the Capitol rotunda today,
then holding a Statehouse news conference. Jackson scheduled a
speech at Washburn University and another at Wichita State
University.
   Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt has the support of Kansas' two
Democratic U.S. House members, Dan Glickman and Jim Slattery, but
has not campaigned here in advance of the caucuses. Illinois Sen.
Paul Simon, who is strapped for cash and concentrating on races in
Michigan and Wisconsin, made little effort here.

   There are two ways, perhaps more, of looking
at the results of President Reagan's six-year effort in support of
the Contra rebels.
   In the administration's view, the Contras have kept the focus of
Nicaragua's leftist government on surviving, preventing it from
promoting the spread of revolution elsewhere.
   As a result, the administration says, each of Nicaragua's
neighbors has been able consolidate or at least make a beginning on
building democratic institutions.
   Reagan's worst-case scenario for the region _ a belt of
pro-Soviet states extending from the Panama Canal to Guatemala with
the possibility that Mexico itself ultimately will be threatened _
has not been borne out. He believes the Contras deserve much of the
credit.
   But the other view is that the costs of the policy have been
exorbitant, far outweighing the benefits.
   Administration critics maintain that American backing for the
Contras has led to tens of thousands of dead and wounded and set
back the Nicaraguan economy by a generation.
   And Nicaragua has been, in some ways, a wrecker of reputations,
playing the same role that Vietnam did two decades ago.
   On Wednesday, the same day that Reagan decided to send U.S.
troops to Honduras, a federal grand jury indicted former national
security adviser John M. Poindexter, Lt. Col. Oliver L. North and
two of their associates, Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakim.
   As independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh described it, ``the
heart of the case'' against the four was their role in diverting
funds from Iran arms sales to the Contras.
   Poindexter and North, two of the most influential figures in
government less than a year and a half ago, face the prospect of
extended jail terms because they are alleged to have disregarded
the law in their zeal to support the Contras.
   The Contra cause has divided American public opinion more than
any other issue during Reagan's presidency. No other dispute has
generated more distrust and acrimony between the administration and
the Congress.
   While Reagan has compared the Contras with America's founding
fathers, Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., calls them ``our
terrorists.'' Both sides believe the other's policies will lead
inevitably to an American troop commitment in the region.
   The U.S. policy has fluctuated over the years. The Contras took
up arms with American encouragement but now live month to month
without knowing whether they can count on continued U.S. backing.
   Their latest setback had its origins in the Feb. 29 cutoff of
U.S. aid. Within days, the Sandinistas began preparations for an
offensive against a rebel concentration in the Bocay Valley near
the Honduran border.
   As described by Bosco Matamoros, a Contra spokesman, the rebels
were left virtually without food and other supplies and the means
to evacuate their wounded. The Sandinistas, whose offensive got
under way in earnest on Tuesday, claim the Contra death toll is in
the hundreds.
   Reagan administration officials say that if the Sandinistas
succeed in destroying a key supply depot in the area, the impact on
the remaining 10,000 or so Contras deployed elsewhere in Nicaragua
could be decisive, both materially and psychologically.
   Administration critics say none of this would have happened if
Reagan had not been so foolish as to believe the Contras could have
prevailed against the Sandinistas in the first place or to think
that such a small, poor country could represent any threat at all
to U.S. security.
   The administration counters that Congress is to blame, and that
reliable U.S. support for the Contras would have eventually
produced a Sandinista surrender, ushering in peace and democracy in
Central America.
   The administration's problem all along has been that it can't
prove its worst-case scenario, unless it happens.
   If indeed the collapse of the Contras leads to the communization
of Central America and a new security situation for the United
States, Reagan will have been proven correct.
   But if that day ever comes, Reagan will be long gone and a
successor administration will have to deal with the consequences.

<HEAD>Democratic Governors Key Players In Muddled Democratic Race</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVANS WITT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colorado's Roy Romer is ready for a brokered
Democratic convention: ``I'm going! I'd like to have a voice.'' But
Arkansas' Bill Clinton is not so sure about a deadlocked meeting in
Atlanta, as the Democratic governors worry about their party's
still unresolved presidential battle.
   ``It depends entirely on how all the major players conduct
themselves,'' said Clinton, who considered entering the 1988 race
himself. ``If it turns out to be a really divisive fight waged in
front of the entire American people on national television, it
could be devastating.''
   The Democratic governors are major players in the 1988
Democratic nomination battle, for they make up part of the 645
unpledged super delegates to the Atlanta convention in July.
   With the Democratic race still confused and lacking a clear
front-runner after a month of primaries and caucuses, the governors
also now take on the role of leaders who can nudge the party to
unify behind one candidate or to take the race to Atlanta.
   ``There will be brokering,'' New York Gov. Mario Cuomo said
Thursday. ``The question is when and how. Either you broker at the
convention ... and the whole United States will see you in the
grubby business of cutting deals. I say that's no way to do it.
Let's do it when they're not watching.''
   One of the governors' own _ Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts _
leads Jesse Jackson narrowly in the race for national convention
delegates, but both are far short of a majority of those chosen.
   Dukakis sought to widen his delegate lead Thursday by working
Capitol Hill, where he picked up several endorsements. He visited
with Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, who is said to be leaning
toward endorsing the Massachusetts governor.
   Colorado's Romer _ who recently endorsed Dukakis with favorite
son Gary Hart out of the race _ was one of the few governors who
has made his choice who still likes the brokered convention idea.
   ``It is possible it wil be undecided by the time we get there
and I don't think that's bad,'' he said. ``It helps in the sense it
keeps the excitement going.''
   Romer brushed aside Democratic Party Chairman Paul Kirk's
suggestion that party leaders get together after the primary ends
in June to unite the party behind the leading candidate at that
point.
   ``Wait a minute! If you have three people pretty close and one's
a little bit higher than the other, I don't think you can make that
decision before the convention. Why do you have a convention? ...
I'm going! I'd like to have a voice,'' he said.
   But Maryland Gov. Donald Schaefer said trying to guide one's
delegation at a multiballot convention would be dangerous: ``I'm
going to step in with a light toe.''
   Minnesota's Gov. Rudy Perpich doesn't think a brokered
convention _ where no candidate has a majority of the delegates and
compromises must be sought to decide on a nominee _ would be so
bad. And he does not agree with Kirk's call for the party leaders
to step in a month before the convention.
   Clinton said Kirk's idea might work if one of the candidate has
more than 1,400 delegates at the end of the primary process _ of
the 2,082 needed to win the nomination.
   Cuomo, who is the oft-mentioned white-knight candidate to be
tapped by a deadlocked convention, said the nominee must be decided
in advance of Atlanta.
   ``There are other people who say, `No, let's do it in the
convention, in the open the way we always have historically.' We
haven't always done it that way. Carter didn't do it that way,
Mondale didn't do it that way,'' he said.
   Both Jimmy Carter in 1976 and Walter Mondale in 1984 picked up
enough delegates outside of the caucus and primary process to win
the nominations.
   ``I think that's the way we ought to do it again, but I don't
think my position is a particularly popular one and I'm afraid that
it may come out that you'll wind up brokering at the convention,''
said Cuomo.
   Cuomo said he expected to play a part in any brokering ``just by
virtue of the place I occupy as governor of the state. We're the
largest state ... with a Democratic governor.''
   Reaction to Kirk's idea was varied. Connecticut Gov. William
O'Neill said that it is too early to be talking about such moves.
And Maryland's Schaefer said circumstances in June will shape such
possibilities: ``It all depends. That's a nice theory but you've
got to be practical.''
   Hawaii Gov. John Waihee and Vermont Gov. Madeleine Kunin join in
fearing a brokered convention, in part because both are Dukakis
backers.
   Tennessee Gov. Ned McWherter, a strong supporter of Sen. Albert
Gore of Tennessee, said he believes Gore ``is in a strong position
to get the nomination by the time the convention begins,'' so
brokering won't be a factor.
   Wyoming Gov. Mike Sullivan thinks that a brokered convention is
a good possibility _ and that it is too early to judge its impact.
   ``I don't think you can answer that good or bad,'' he said. ``I
think it would depend on how it was handled during the convention.
It certainly is going to generate some enthusiasm that will be
absent in the Republican convention.''
   Dukakis has 464.5 delegate votes, just ahead of Jackson with
460.55. Gore has 354 and Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois 171.5. Rep.
Richard Gephardt of Missouri has 145 delegates. A total of 272.65
are uncommitted.
   Among the super delegates, Dukakis has 42.5 votes, Gephardt 21,
Gore, 19.8, Jackson 19.55, Simon 15.5 and uncommitted 237.65.

<HEAD>Young At Risk For AIDS Because They Often Ignore Warnings, Koop

   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop says he fears
the tendency of the young to believe health warnings are not
intended for them could lead to the AIDS virus spreading among high
school and college-age Americans.
   ``My greatest concern is with the group aged 15 to 24,'' Koop
told a convention of hospital administrators Thursday.
   Officials may have a better idea of the extent of the AIDS virus
among college students by the end of the year as more colleges go
along with a Centers for Disease Control request to conduct blind
blood testing, Koop said.
   Under such procedures, already used by hospitals in about 40
cities, blood drawn for other purposes is tested for AIDS without
the sample being identified by patient.
   He noted that sexually transmitted diseases in general are
rising at the steepest rate in 16 years ``in spite of the
tremendous educational campaign in 1987, where for the first time
in history we were discussing in the print media and on television
very blunt statements about AIDS and sexually transmitted disease.''
   ``If there is HIV (the AIDS virus) out there, and we know there
is, then there can't help but be some infection going on that we're
not going to see until we get down the road about five years,'' he
told the Federation of American Health Systems.
   It can take five years or more for AIDS to develop after a
person contracts the virus.
   ``So with teen-agers, who think that they're immortal, who
always think the health message is meant for the person next to
them, who have sort of a sense that risk-taking is sort of fun, we
have our most difficult target group, especially with regard to
heterosexual transmission.''
   Earlier, the federal official who oversees the Medicare and
Medicaid government health programs for the elderly and poor told
the hospital executives they have been given ``an almost impossible
task: controlling physician decision-making.''
   ``In the coming years, the challenge of cost constraint will
continue unabated, but the focus will have to shift from hospital
to physician payment reform,'' said Dr. William L. Roper, head of
the Health Care Financing Administration.
   ``There is deep-seated ambivalence in America about intruding on
physician decision-making,'' said Roper, ``but we cannot have both
physician autonomy and cost constraint.''

<TEXT>
   The Republican Party
chairman of this U.S. commonwealth and five other people connected
to the government were charged by a federal grand jury with
extorting money from businessmen.
   Among those named in two indictments returned Thursday were the
party chairman, Jesus Mafnas, a government personnel officer;
commonwealth Rep. Mariano Bermudes; former commonwealth Senate
president Ponciano Rasa and his brother, Oscar Rasa, publisher of
the now-defunct Commonwealth Examiner newspaper.
   Also indicted were former Senate legal counsel James Doerty and
former Senate employee Leo Pangelinan.
   One indictment accused Mafnas of soliciting and receiving a
$22,760 bribe in 1986 from Adrian Johnston, owner of the Surf Hotel.
   In exchange for the money, Mafnas guaranteed that the Marianas
Public Land Corp. would grant the hotel a lease for a piece of
public beachfront land located next to the hotel, the indictment
said.
   In the second indictment, the Rasa brothers, Pangelinan,
Bermudes and Doerty were accused of demanding payments of $222,000
in 1983 from Sumitomo Corp. and subsequently receiving $113,000 in
bribes from the Japanese construction company.
   According to the indictment, the five conspired to force
Sumitomo to pay a 1 percent commission on all Northern Marianas
business awarded the company.
   Mafnas and Bermudes were each charged with one count of
extortion. The Rasa brothers were each charged with two counts of
extortion, while Doerty and Pangelinan each faced three counts of
extortion. Mafnas also was charged with one count of conspiracy to
commit extortion.
   At the request of assistant U.S. Attorney George Proctor, U.S.
District Judge Alfred Laureta set bail for Mafnas, Ponciano Rasa,
Pangelinan and Bermudes at $25,000 each. Laureta also issued arrest
warrants for Oscar Rasa and Doerty, who now live in California.
   Arraignment was set for March 25.
   Bermudes had no comment on the indictment, Pangelinan and
Mafanas have unlisted numbers and could not be reached for comment
and Ponciano Rasa did return a telephone call to his home, the
Pacific Daily News reported.

<HEAD>Reagan Pushes For $60 Million Transfer For Coast Guard Patrols</HEAD>

   Severe cutbacks are devastating the Coast
Guard's drug interdiction and search and rescue operations, the
agency's chief said in asking Congress for an immediate transfer of
$60 million from other accounts.
   ``We have Coast Guard cutters sitting at docks and planes on the
runways,'' said Adm. Paul A. Yost, commandant of the Coast Guard.
``Congressional approval of the reprogramming request would let us
put those ships and planes back to work patrolling the high seas.''
   President Reagan on Thursday asked Congress to transfer money
from highway, mass transit and Amtrak funds to restore the patrols,
which were ordered cut back by the administration last month to
help make up for a $103 million budget shortfall.
   The Coast Guard eliminated routine search and rescue patrols,
cut drug patrols by 55 percent, eliminated 1,100 jobs, closed down
nearly 30 Coast Guard installations and severely reduced other
stations.
   None of the jobs or installations would be restored with the $60
million. That money would be devoted exclusively to restoring
patrol levels to their pre-cutback levels, Yost said.
   Before the cutbacks, Yost said, 90 percent of the agency's drug
seizures came from routine patrols. Last year, $3 billion in
cocaine alone was seized by the Coast Guard, he said.
   The commandant said it was too early to quantify the cutback's
impact on drug seizures or rescue missions, but he predicted it was
heavy.
   Yost said he and Transportation Secretary James Burnley
conferred with lawmakers before making the recommendations.
   ``I will do everything I can to work with Congress to get it
passed,'' Yost said.
   The request would not increase overall spending since the money
is already appropriated.
   Under the administration's plan, $25.3 million would come from
Federal Highway Administration funds that are not earmarked for
specific projects; $17.3 million from mass transit grants; $12.4
million from a 2 percent reduction in Amtrak's budget; and $5
million from last year's Coast Guard research and development funds.
   Yost said even if Congress approves the administration's budget
proposal for fiscal year 1989 in full _ a $200 million increase
from this year _ there are no plans to reopen the closed
installations or rehire employees.

<HEAD>Group Of Nine Hopes To Break Committee Deadlock Over Clean Air</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nine members of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee have staged a quiet revolution against their chairmen in
an effort to break a six-year logjam that has stalled committee
action on air quality legislation.
   The low-key uprising led by Rep. Al Swift, D-Wash., came to a
seemingly harmonious head Thursday when the self-proclaimed ``Group
of Nine'' unveiled a compromise plan to escalate the battle against
urban pollution.
   Their effort drew applause from the targets of their end-run
around the committee system: Chairman John Dingell, D-Mich., and
Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of the health and the
environment subcommittee. The details of their plan didn't.
   Swift and his allies effectively took over the committee's air
quality deliberations last December after months of fruitless
wrangling between Dingell and Waxman, the sponsor of an air quality
bill endorsed by environmentalists but deadlocked in his
subcommittee with a 10-10 split.
   ``It's a legislative product,'' Swift told a news conference.
``None of us is happy with every last detail. ... This is a good
piece of environmental policy, and it's cost effective.''
   Their plan in many ways is similar to Waxman's bill and one
produced last year by the Senate Environment Committee but still
awaiting a call to the floor by a major foe, Majority Leader Robert
Byrd, D-W.Va.
   Each proposal calls for stricter emissions controls on industry
and automobiles in an effort to reduce the carbon monoxide and
smog-producing ozone that the Environmental Protection Agency says
have reached unhealthy levels for some 100 million people living in
60 or so metropolitan areas.
   The group's plan, however, would give states and localities more
time to come up with plans to cut pollution, from three to 16
years, depending on the severity of their problems.
   The plan would leave most remedies up to EPA and the states, but
at minimum a city falling short of clean air standards would have
to institute a vehicle inspection and maintenance program.
   Swift and Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio, said group members would
begin working next week on an acid rain plan, which has also been
divisive.
   Dingell, from an automaking district, has been firm against
calls for cleaner vehicle exhausts, saying the retirement of older
vehicles lacking emissions controls will cause vehicular pollution
to continue to decrease.
   In a prepared statement, Dingell said the Group of Nine plan is
``a vast improvement'' over Waxman's bill and has a ``real
opportunity to gain my full support.''
   Waxman called the proposal a ``very constructive step.''
   Earl Mallich, chairman of industry's Clean Air Working Group,
said the proposed tailpipe standards may not be technologically
achievable. R.G. Ensz, spokesman for the American Petroleum
Institute, said that a proposal to make fuel less evaporative was
not cost effective.
   The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of the United States
said the plan for cleaner exhausts would have imperceptible
benefits to the nation's air.
   Spokesmen for the Sierra Club and Environmental Action said they
were pleased the plan called for tighter controls on industries and
vehicles, but said the pace of controls was too slow.
   Other members of the Swift group are Mike Synar, D-Okla.; Phil
Sharp, D-Ind.; Jim Cooper, D-Tenn.; Jim Slattery, D-Kan.; Bill
Tauzin, D-La.; and Rick Boucher, D-Va.

   The deadline set by Secretary of State George
P. Shultz for Arab and Israeli replies to his Mideast peace plan is
passing with the outlook for eventual acceptance bleak.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir wound up four days of
talks Thursday critical of Shultz's call for an international
conference.
   He didn't say yes and he didn't say no to the plan, which also
anticipates Israel yielding at least part of the West Bank and Gaza
in exchange for Arab recongition.
   But most of what Shamir had to say during his visit was critical
of the proposal _ especially its call for an international
conference hosted by the United States, the Soviet Union and the
three other permament members of the U.N. Security Council: China,
Britain and France.
   The other major player in the Shultz scenario, King Hussein of
Jordan, has not replied to the U.S. plan. A Jordanian official,
speaking this week in Amman on condition of anonymity, said he
doubted there would be a definitive reponse for 10 days.
   An indication of Arab reservations came Thursday from Clovis
Maksoud, the Arab League's representative here. He criticized the
exclusion of the Palestine Liberation Organization and urged the
United States to demand a total Israeli withdrawal from the West
Bank and Gaza.
   At least 100 Palestinian Arabs have died in a little more than
three months in clashes with Israeli forces. Shultz's proposal
would lead to self-rule for three years, with negotiations on an
overall settlement to begin by December.
   Israel took control of the territories from Jordan and Egypt in
the 1967 Six-Day war. Shamir and other Likud bloc leaders have
vowed not to surrender any of the land.
   Shultz submitted his plan for negotiations two weeks ago to
Israel, Jordan and also Syria, which would be participate in the
talks on an overall settlement. He asked for a reply by mid-March.
   ``As you know, I, in general, think that deadlines are good
things in trying to get people to make up their minds,'' Shultz
told reporters on his Mideast shuttle. ``So we have pointed out the
fact that the situation carries inherent in it a certain sense of
deadlines.''
   And yet, Shultz noted philosophically, ``you can't push people
if they don't want to be pushed.''
   Shamir headed for Los Angeles from Washington. He and the other
senior members of the Israeli Cabinet will take up the U.S.
proposal next Wednesday. A vote by the full Cabinet would be likely
on Sunday, March 27.
   If Israel and Jordan both say ``yes'' by then, the Shultz plan
could take off. But there would be little room, if any, to make
changes.
   President Reagan and Shultz both have ruled out revisions.
Reagan said he would neither ``slice'' the plan apart nor abandon
it. Shultz told the Senate Budget Committee on Thursday, ``The
United States will not permit any aspect of its proposal to be
eroded or compromised.''
   But Shamir clearly is hoping for at least one major change. He
wants to replace the international conference with a ``ceremony''
held by the United States and the Soviet Union. Afterward, Israel
and the Arabs would negotiate directly.
   Shultz is trying to win Shamir over with reassurances.
   He told the Senate committee after a final meeting with the
prime minister that the United States would not attend _ or remain
_ at a conference designed to replace direct Arab-Israeli
negotiations.
   ``The conference will be specifically enjoined from imposing
solutions or vetoing what had been agreed bilaterally,'' Shultz
said.
   Maksoud of the Arab League called, meanwhile, for a U.S.
commitment at the outset of negotiations backing Arab demands that
Israel yield all the territory captured in the 1967 war.
   In a speech, Maksoud also reasserted the Arab position that the
PLO is the sole legitimate representative of Palestinian Arabs.
Some 1.5 million live on the West Bank and Gaza, which were
controlled until 1967 by Jordan and Egypt.
   Shultz's plan does not insist that Israel relinquish all of the
territory. Also, it excludes the PLO from the negotiations.
Palestinians approved by the PLO would be in a delegation with
Jordan.
   Maksoud said an international conference must have the power to
settle disputes between Israel and the Arabs. ``It cannot be a
ceremonial opening, or an event, or some sort of an international
framework,'' he said _ taking direct aim at Shamir's proposal.
   Maksoud also criticized Reagan's appeal to both sides to accept
the U.S. initiative without modification.
   In light of what he called ``bitter Arab experience,'' he said,
``We find ourselves unwilling to be rushed into a timetable
presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.''

<HEAD>Thurmond Won't Help Citizens Restore Original Name To Thurmond
Lake</HEAD>

   A group of people living on the Georgia-South
Carolina line says there's nothing wrong with Strom Thurmond unless
it's the name of a lake shared by the two states.
   The group met privately with the veteran South Carolina
Republican for 35 minutes Thursday to present petitions signed by
42,000 people who want the senator's help in restoring the lake's
original name, Lake Clarks Hill.
   Of the signatures, 30,000 came from the Georgia side, and a
legislative proposal to repeal the new name is sponsored by eight
Democratic congressmen from that state.
   Thurmond said he would stay out of the dispute, which began in
December when Congress renamed the 42-year-old Army Corps of
Engineers lake quickly and with no public hearings.
   ``He told them he feels the matter is settled and since he did
not instigate it or push for it, he feels it would be inappropriate
for him to get involved now,'' press secretary Christopher Simpson
said.
   The meeting also was attended by a group of South Carolina
legislators who want to keep the Thurmond name. ``We're disturbed
that this is going to be an embarrassment to Sen. Thurmond,'' said
state Sen. John Drummond of Greenwood.
   Drummond said the South Carolina lawmakers told the citizens
group that it would be an embarrassment for Thurmond to ``ask the
whole Congress and the president to reverse what they've done.''
   Thurmond himself had nothing to say, referring all questions to
Simpson.
   Roy Giles, a Lincolnton, Ga., restaurant owner and one of the
leaders of ``Keep Our Lake Clarks Hill,'' said the petitions
presented Thursday propose a compromise that would restore the name
of the lake to Clarks Hill but would retain the new Strom Thurmond
name for the dam and road.
   ``Sen. Thurmond will have his monument and the people will have
their lake back,'' Giles said of the compromise, which has been
incorporated into a bill that Rep. Doug Barnard, an Augusta, Ga.,
Democrat, has introduced in the House with the backing of the other
seven Democrats in the Georgia House delegation.
   Giles said he was surprised when the South Carolina lawmakers
showed up at the meeting because Thurmond originally had agreed to
meet privately with representatives of the citizens group opposed
to the name change.
   Giles said the name change will cause financial hardships for
businesses around the lake that have built their reputations using
the Clarks Hill name. And he vowed that the group will continue its
fight, even without Thurmond's help.
   ``We're going to continue to get signatures,'' he said. ``We're
not going to let up. This was just an opportunity to present our
case to Sen. Thurmond and ask for his help.''

   Israeli representatives are trying to strike a
deal with Iran-Contra prosecutors over immunity for four Israelis
and U.S. access to Israel's Swiss bank account records.
   The meetings with Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh's staff
began Thursday, a day after a federal grand jury indicted Lt. Col.
Oliver North, former national security adviser John Poindexter and
two arms dealers. All four were involved in the diversion of
profits from Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   Israel is seeking immunity from prosecution for four Israelis
involved in the sale of U.S. anti-tank missiles to Iran in 1985 and
1986, said an Israeli official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Walsh, in turn, wants records of Israeli transactions with North
and the two indicted arms dealers, Richard Secord and Albert Hakim,
the official said.
   Yossi Gal, a spokesman for the Israeli Embassy, said a meeting
today was aimed at ``finding an acceptable solution for cooperation
between the two governments.''
   Israel is seeking immunity for Amiram Nir, a Israeli
anti-terrorism official; David Kimche, the former foreign ministry
director; and businessmen Yaacov Nimrodi and Al Schwimmer. All
worked with North on the Iran arms sales.
   Gal also said that Rafael Vardi, a retired Israeli general who
compiled a chronology of Israel's role in the arms sales to Iran,
met with Walsh on Thursday. Several Israeli lawyers accompanied
him, according to the Israeli official who spoke anonymously.
   Elyakim Rubinstein, a top aide to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, is expected to join Vardi today for talks with Walsh's
staff, Gal said.
   Rubinstein, who has been in the United States with Shamir for
discussions on a Middle East peace plan, also will meet with Reagan
administration officials about the case, Gal said. He refused to
discuss the meetings further.
   James Wieghart, Walsh's spokesman, said he knew nothing of the
meetings but confirmed that Walsh has been negotiating with the
Israelis for a long time about access to the records on the Swiss
accounts.
   The Israeli official who spoke on condition he remain anonymous
said Walsh is seeking bank account records to corroborate other
evidence about Israel's transactions with North, Secord and Hakim.
   Walsh angered Israel last year by issuing subpoenas against Nir,
Kimche, Nimrodi and Schwimmer, meaning they could be arrested if
they visited the United States and refused to testify.
   Under pressure from the United States, Rubinstein and Vardi
compiled classified historical and financial chronologies that were
provided to the congressional Iran-Contra committees last year. The
documents detailed the role Israel played in shipping U.S. missiles
to Iran as part of a plan to secure freedom for American hostages
in Lebanon.
   During the congressional hearings, Israel refused to allow the
four Israelis involved in the arms sales to testify, but agreed to
let Vardi answer questions. The congressional panels did not call
Vardi, saying they were satisfied with the written chronologies.

   FBI Director William Sessions is coming under
increasing fire on Capitol Hill in connection with the racial
harassment case of black FBI agent Donald Rochon.
   On Thursday, Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., accused Sessions of
``sidestepping'' and engaging in ``a classic stall'' by promising
to give a full report to Congress at a later date on Rochon and
equal employment matters.
   ``I am frankly deeply disappointed in your lack of candor and
outrage about the terrorism that is going on,'' Conyers said in
referring to the Rochon case and other allegations of
discrimination within the bureau.
   Rochon is suing the FBI and the Justice Department, alleging
racial discrimination, harassment and death threats from fellow
agents and supervisors when he worked at FBI offices in Omaha,
Neb., and Chicago. The federal Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission has upheld Rochon's racial discrimination allegations in
connection with his stay in Omaha in 1983 and 1984.
   ``There has been no sidestepping at all, none,'' responded
Sessions, who has been FBI director for four months.
   He said he was in ``almost total agreement'' with Conyers'
concerns and said he is committed to seeing that the bureau ``is
precisely what it strives to be, an organization which has no
racism.''
   However, Sessions said that with lawsuits pending he cannot
conduct a detailed discussion during this ``awkward period of
time.''
   In addition to the Rochon case, Hispanic agents have filed a
class-action suit in El Paso, Texas, accusing the FBI of racial
discrimination.
   Blacks and Hispanics each make up slightly more than 4 percent
of the bureau's more than 9,000 agents.
   In prepared testimony before the House subcommittee on civil and
constitutional rights, of which Conyers is a member, Sessions said
he has designated executive assistant FBI director John D. Glover,
who is black, to oversee a complete review of equal employment
opportunity matters within the FBI.
   Sessions said Glover ``will report directly to me'' concerning
the Rochon matter and other aspects of the FBI's equal employment
opportunity program including training, handling of complaints,
hiring and promotion policy.
   ``In both cases, I can assure this subcommittee that once these
processes have been completed, I will make a full reporting to
Congress,'' Sessions said.

<HEAD>Measure Overhauling Disaster Aid System Passes House</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation to double the maximum amount of
disaster aid to households and provide money to combat erosion and
flooding along the Great Lakes faces an uncertain future in the
Senate after passing the House.
   The Disaster Relief Amendments, opposed by the Reagan
administration as too expensive, passed the House Thursday by a
vote of 368-13. A companion bill with 27 co-sponsors has languished
in the Senate since its introduction there last year.
   Under the amendments, the Federal Emergency Management Agency
would be barred from paying less than a 75 percent share of aid to
local governments qualifying for public repair projects following a
disaster. The amendments also would add guidelines to speed the
distribution of post-disaster aid, and permit federal funds to be
used for local projects to lessen the effect of disasters before
they strike.
   The cap on grants for states' disaster preparation programs
would climb from $25,000 to $50,000, and the maximum on awards to
individuals to rebuild households and clear away debris would go
from $5,000 to $10,000, with the amount to be adjusted according to
the economy.
   In addition, the legislation would provide, for the first time,
a mechanism to appeal decisions on eligibility for disaster and
emergency assistance.
   The legislation has its roots in the federal response to
tornadoes that raced through western Pennsylvania, Ohio and
surrounding areas in 1985, killing 88 people.
   FEMA agrees that ``fine-tuning'' is needed to the 1974 act
establishing a coordinated federal program to prepare for and
respond to hurricanes, tornadoes, storms and floods. But the
administration has pushed for legislation that wouldn't increase
costs to the federal government.
   The Congressional Budget Office has estimated the cost of the
House easure at $50 to $100 million per year. In addition to
updating the disaster response program, the legislation would
provide grants and Army Corps of Engineers assistance for flooding
and erosion prevention in Great Lakes states.
   High-water levels have caused an estimated $200 million in
damage to shoreline houses and communities, the Northeast-Midwest
Congressional Coalition said. States would be required to put up 30
percent matching share of the federal grants.
   U.S. Rep. Tom Ridge, R-Pa., the principal sponsor of the bill,
said the 1985 tornadoes that killed 65 people in Pennsylvania alone
made him ``painfully aware'' of shortcomings with FEMA.
   ``Disaster victims were waiting in line for temporary housing up
to six weeks,'' Ridge said during Thursday's floor debate.
   ``I was touring demolished home sites arguing with federal
officials about debris removal,'' he said. ``They weren't concerned
about debris removal. They were concerned about the specific,
inflexible application of regulations, regardless of the impact on
public health and safety.''

<HEAD>House Budget Committee Approves $1.1 Trillion Federal Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's business and financial communities
should be encouraged by the ease with which the House Budget
Committee has approved a $1.1 trillion federal budget for the 1989
fiscal year, the panel's chairman says.
   Chairman William H. Gray III, D-Pa., made the remarks Thursday
after his committee approved the budget resolution with support
from lawmakers of both parties.
   ``I think it's good in terms of helping the volatility out there
in the equity markets ... and sending a signal to our trading
partners that we're willing to work cooperatively in terms of
addressing the deficit,'' Gray said.
   The budget plan meets the spending and tax strictures
established by last year's budget summit pact between Congress and
President Reagan. That accord was sparked by October's stock market
crash and the resulting calls to slash the government's deficits,
which have surpassed $200 billion in recent years.
   The spending document would leave a deficit of $134.1 billion,
according to the budget panel, enough to avoid automatic spending
cuts under the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law.
   But to get to that figure, lawmakers adopted the White House's
economic forecasts and abandoned gloomier estimates produced by
their own Congressional Budget Office that would have added $35
billion in red ink to the deficit projection.
   Under Gramm-Rudman, the deficit target for fiscal 1989, which
begins Oct. 1, is $136 billion. Spending would be cut to that level
automatically if the deficit exceeds the target by $10 billion.
   The document, expected to be considered by the full House next
week, reduces Reagan's request for science and space and allocates
the money to urban and social programs.
   The budget resolution was pieced together over the last several
days during closed-door meetings between committee Republicans and
Democrats. The panel approved the document, on a voice vote with no
objections, during a five-minute public session.
   Rep. Willis D. Gradison Jr. of Ohio, senior committee Republican
at the meeting, said the resolution had been written in an
``excellent spirit of bipartisanship'' and had ``very strong
support'' from GOP lawmakers.
   The bipartisan camaraderie was in stark contrast to last year,
when Republicans walked away from the budget resolution process and
the bickering lasted for months.
   The budget pact reached last November between Reagan and
lawmakers locked in new taxes and spending levels for fiscal 1988
and 1989 for defense, foreign affairs and overall domestic spending.
   Lawmakers are proving eager to avoid reopening those questions
and sparking potentially bitter fights in an election year. Thus,
the main fight has been over distributing the $169.2 billion the
summit allows for the domestic programs that Congress directly
oversees and are not financed under automatic formulas.
   ``I think the summit agreement basically set the tone for the
year,'' said Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif.
   In the 1989 budget he presented to Congress on Feb. 18, Reagan
proposed a 20 percent increase in spending on space and science
programs to $13.1 billion. The budget panel, looking to restore
proposed cuts to several other domestic programs, pared that
increase to $12.2 billion.
   ``The committee felt that was a realistic figure for NASA to
carry out its mission,'' Gray said.
   Where Reagan proposed cutting deeply into programs such as mass
transit assistance and eliminating other programs such as federal
aid to Amtrak, the passenger railroad, the budget committee would
retain current levels of spending or reduce it by 1 percent or 2
percent.
   For programs for low-income people such as job training and
child health care, the budget panel's proposal would allow enough
of a spending increase to keep up with inflation, expected to reach
4 percent this year.
   The committee's budget also rejects $1.2 billion in savings in
Medicare that Reagan had proposed, spends $1.5 billion for AIDS
research _ slightly more than the president proposed _ and retains
previously planned levels of spending for education, fighting drugs
and providing aid to the homeless.
   The panel also proposed a 3 percent pay raise for federal
workers and civilian employees of the military. Gray said lawmakers
will have to decide later this year whether members of Congress
would qualify for the salary increases.
   The committee's budget leaves intact the summit agreement
spending levels of $294 billion for military programs for the 1989
fiscal year, and $14 billion in new taxes, mostly on corporations.
   The Senate plans to write its budget resolution next month. The
resolution does not need the president's signature, and it serves
as a blueprint for actual spending legislation to be enacted later.
   In a separate action, the White House sent Congress a
supplemental spending request for this fiscal year that would
increase spending by $1.1 billion, mostly for veterans.
   Another $57 million would pay for raises for federal court
employees, and $54 million more would be for disability payments to
people with black lung disease.
   The measure would allow an additional $4.2 billion to be
transferred among agencies.

   A frustrated congressman had to turn to the
Japanese Embassy this week to find out exactly what the Senate was
proposing to do on trade legislation.
   ``That is just not the way to do business,'' Rep. Tom Downey,
D-N.Y., said Thursday following a closed-door caucus at which
grievances over the incident got a full-scale airing.
   At the caucus, Rep. William Frenzel, R-Minn., expressed outrage
that he had to rely on the Japanese Embassy to get a copy of the
Senate proposal on how best to crack down on Japanese barriers to
American exports.
   Pat Eveland, Frenzel's administrative assistant, confirmed that
the congressman was disturbed about the delay in transmitting the
Senate report to the House and raised the issue at the closed-door
session.
   ``We think it would be nice if the Senate would decide to give
us the trade offer first before the private sector and the press,''
she said. Frenzel himself was not available to discuss the matter,
she added.
   The document was a compromise offer from Senate members of a
House-Senate conference committee that is trying to merge rival
versions of a 1,000-page trade bill passed by the two houses last
year.
   Among other things, the Senate's offer proposed to erase from
the bill the controversial trade plan sponsored by Democratic
presidential hopeful Richard Gephardt, D-Mo. His plan, calling for
10 percent yearly rollbacks in Japanese trade surpluses, is
contained only in the House version.
   The Senate's alternative proposal would require the U.S. trade
representative to draw up a list of Japanese barriers to American
products and then either negotiate an end to them or retaliate.
   Eveland said she was on the telephone with a Japanese Embassy
official early Wednesday morning, discussing the Senate's offer,
when to her surprise ``it became evident that they had a copy of
it.''
   She said she asked the Japanese for a copy and they immediately
duplicated theirs and sent it by messenger to Frenzel's office on
Capitol Hill. She said a version was not available from the Senate
Finance Committee until 12:30 p.m. Wednesday.
   It remained unclear just how the Japanese managed to obtain
their copy of the offer.
   When Eveland was told that several copies were distributed to
reporters who worked late in the Senate Press Gallery on Tuesday
night, she said, ``Well, now we'll know where to go.''

   Henry Kissinger may be called to testify at Lyndon
LaRouche's trial to rebut charges by LaRouche's lawyers that the
government launched a vendetta against the political extremist, a
prosecutor says.
   LaRouche's attorneys, who contend the federal charges against
LaRouche were fabricated, showed the jury letters Thursday in which
Kissinger, as secretary of state, requested an FBI investigation of
LaRouche groups.
   Kissinger may be called to testify that he was a target of
protests and harassment by LaRouche followers and was justified in
seeking the probe, Assistant U.S. Attorney John Markham said.
   LaRouche lawyers said they would welcome an opportunity to
cross-examine Kissinger, whom the fringe politician has labeled a
Soviet spy.
   LaRouche, six aides and five LaRouche organizations are charged
with conspiring to obstruct a grand jury investigation of alleged
credit card and loan fraud by LaRouche's 1984 presidential
campaign. Four of the organizations are charged with fraud.
   Also Thursday, Richard Welsh, an accountant and treasurer with
several LaRouche groups, testified that LaRouche's two campaign
organizations budgeted up to $125,000 a month to pay back credit
card charges that card-holders claimed were unauthorized.
   Prosecutors allege the campaign relied on fraudulent charges to
stay afloat when legitimate fund-raising stalled, knowing it would
take several weeks before unauthorized charges would be deducted
from the campaign's bank account.
   The campaign allegedly misused the charge-card numbers given by
contributors for donations or by people who bought books and other
literature from the LaRouche groups.
   The defendants contend evidence of widespread fraud and
obstruction was fabricated by FBI and CIA infiltrators as part of a
Reagan administration effort to ruin LaRouche and cripple his
highly successful fund-raising.
   Admitted as evidence to the jury Thursday was a series of
letters between Kissinger, then-FBI Director William H. Webster and
Oliver Revell, the FBI's executive assistant director, discussing
LaRouche organizations.
   In an August 1982 letter to Webster, Kissinger complained that
LaRouche supporters had become ``increasingly obnoxious'' in their
criticism of him and asked whether the FBI could investigate
LaRouche groups.
   Revell responded with two letters saying the agency would
investigate Kissinger's complaint and that there appeared to be
some evidence of illegal telephone use by LaRouche supporters to
harass Kissinger.
   No LaRouche followers ever were charged with harassing or
threatening Kissinger.
   The defense contends Revell later directed FBI infiltration of
LaRouche groups at the request of Lt. Col. Oliver North, the former
White House national security aide indicted Wednesday for his role
in the Iran-Contra affair.
   LaRouche contends he has been the target of a 20-year government
vendetta that climaxed in 1984 because of his outspoken criticism
of Reagan's Contra-aid programs.
   Last week, the defense was given two declassified documents, one
a memo to North from another pivotal figure in the Iran-Contra
affair discussing apparent efforts to collect information against
LaRouche.
   The discovery of those documents 60 days into the trial prompted
Keeton to order an extensive search of government records,
including those of the White House and Vice President George Bush,
for any evidence of infiltration or harassment of LaRouche groups.
The searches are expected to be completed by next week.

   The Army battalions ordered to Honduras by
President Reagan include two from the renowned 82nd Airborne
Division and two from a newly activated ``light'' division
organized for quick movement around the world.
   The 82nd Airborne and the 7th Light Infantry Division are based
at opposite ends of the country _ Fort Bragg, N.C., and Fort Ord,
Calif., respectively _ and are assigned to different corps.
   But the two divisions and their battalions share a common
emphasis and mission _ maintain a high state of readiness and be
ready to operate on short notice in virtually all parts of the
world.
   The 82nd Airborne, as its name implies, is trained to drop in
uninvited by parachute when combat requires. The 7th Light
Infantry, on the other hand, doesn't use parachutes but can arrive
even more quickly.
   The 82nd is renowned because of its combat record and its role
as the one Army unit that is on constant alert.
   During World War II, the unit participated in six different
campaigns, including Sicily and the Normandy invasion. Its
commanders included Gens. Omar Bradley and Matthew Ridgway.
   It was during and immediately after Normandy that the 82nd
really made its mark, taking horrendous casualties but preventing
the Germans from moving forward to stop the invasion.
   The 82nd also has fought in Vietnam and Grenada and some of its
units have served with the peacekeeping force in the Sinai. Within
the United States, it helped keep the peace during the integration
battles in the South, quelled riots in Detroit in 1967, and kept
order during the Republican national convention in Miami in 1968.
   The 7th was the first of what the Army hopes will be four
active-duty light divisions. With about 10,500 soldiers assigned to
it instead of the 17,000 assigned to a normal mechanized division,
the 7th is full of riflemen, carries no heavy vehicles and is armed
with only modest amounts of artillery and anti-tank weapons.
   The idea behind the light divisions was to provide a president
the option of using a fairly large force that could be moved
rapidly around the world.
   For example, a normal heavy division, such as those assigned to
Europe, would require about 2,850 flights of a C-141 to deploy. The
82nd Airborne, if the entire division moved out, would require
about 1,500. A light division could show up with just 500 flights.
   ``There's just so much more mobility,'' noted Lt. Col. Greg
Rixon, an Army spokesman. ``The tradeoff is you can't leave it (in
a battle zone) on its own for very long. It has to be resupplied
and sustained.''
   The Pentagon said Thursday it expected the four battalions from
the 82nd and 7th to link up on the ground in Honduras as a brigade
task force for a readiness exercise code-named ``Golden Pheasant,''
to be conducted in cooperation with Honduran troops.
   The task force is commanded by Army Brig Gen. Daniel R.
Schroeder of the XVIII Airborne Corps and a deputy, Brig. Gen.
James J. Johnson of the 82nd.
   Besides the four battalions of infantry, the task force is
bringing with it a small helicopter cavalry unit with eight
aircraft; three batteries from field artillery units and a brigade
headquarters company.
   Normally, Army units sent to Honduras for exercises report to
Joint Task Force Bravo, a small headquarters unit based in Honduras
to coordinate U.S. troop activities. As of Thursday, for example,
the Pentagon said about 2,050 National Guard and Reserve engineers
were on temporary duty in Honduras.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Bob Dole, who has taken a beating at the
hands of George Bush in nearly all the Republican presidential
primaries, won hands down among a select group of young voters.
   One hundred and two high school student leaders were asked in
January to name their favorite candidates in both the Republican
and Democratic parties. The students are winners of the Century III
Leaders scholarship program sponsored by the National Association
of Secondary School Principals and Shell Oil Co.
   On the GOP side, the student leaders chose Dole over Bush by 70
percent to 15 percent, with 10 percent naming Pete du Pont, who is
now out of the race, according to survey results released Thursday.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis was the favorite on the
Democratic side, getting 37 percent of the students' votes to 17
percent for Sens. Albert Gore Jr. and Paul Simon, 10 percent for
Bruce Babbitt (now a dropout), 9 percent for Rep. Richard Gephardt
and just 4 percent for Jesse Jackson.

<HEAD>N.J. Leader Drops Plan To Send Uncommitted Slate To Democratic
Convention</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AM) _ New Jersey Senate Democratic Leader John
Lynch says he will abandon a proposal to send a slate of
uncommitted delegates to the Democratic National Convention.
   Lynch said Thursday he will drop a movement he headed and bow to
the request of Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J.
   Bradley met with Democratic leaders Wednesday and asked them to
drop their efforts toward an uncommitted slate, saying the drive
could be interpreted outside the state as a movement to back him as
a presidential candidate.
   ``Senator Bradley feels the uncommitted movement would be
perceived as a `stalking horse' for a candidacy at a brokered
convention,'' Lynch said.
   Lynch has said an uncommitted slate could enable New Jersey to
play a decisive role at the convention if no Democratic candidate
wins a majority of delegates in the primaries.

   The coordinator of Jesse Jackson's
presidential campaign in South Carolina says he may ask a judge to

   Kevin Gray said Thursday he is frustrated by the inefficiency of
the Democratic caucus and the absence of delegate lists.
   ``The caucus process is rearing its ugly head,'' said Gray, one

holding a primary.
   Eighteen counties' conventions are meeting Monday and the other
28 counties are meeting March 28. Jackson was the overwhelming
winner at Saturday's 1,788 precinct caucus meetings.
   Gray said it's important to all of the campaigns to have access
to the delegate lists so they can make sure their delegates know
where and when to go to the county conventions and so they can seek

   The State Election Board concluded on Thursday that LaRouche's

   Indiana law requires 500 signatures from each of the state's 10

<TEXT>
   A close friend of Attorney General Edwin Meese
III said Meese interceded on Wedtech Corp.'s behalf to gain federal
approval for financing, a witness testified at the racketeering
trial of Rep. Mario Biaggi.
   The witness, former Wedtech Vice Chairman Mario Moreno, said
Meese's lawyer and friend, E. Robert Wallach, told him at a 1983
meeting across the street from the White House that Meese had asked
then-Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige to sign the necessary
documents.
   Moreno said Thursday he was told that Baldrige balked at signing
because the matter was ``too hot politically,'' but two or three
days later ``the matter was resolved.''
   Moreno recounted the meeting with Wallach in his third day of
testimony at federal court in Manhattan, where Biaggi and six
others are on trial on charges of turning Wedtech into a
racketeering enterprise through an alleged series of bribery and
extortion schemes.
   Wedtech, a now-bankrupt defense contractor, at the time was
delinquent on two loans of more than $2 million each, one from the
Commerce Department's Economic Development Administration, the
other guaranteed by EDA.
   The company in 1983 wanted EDA approval to refinance the loans
with a new bank.
   But the EDA chief, Assistant Commerce Secretary Carlos Campbell,
resisted pressure from former White House political director Lyn
Nofziger and his lobbying partner, Mark Bragg, to approve the plan.
   Moreno, one of four ex-Wedtech officials who have pleaded guilty
to bribing public officials and other crimes, testified Wallach
``said he was going to a national security meeting at 6 a.m. and
told me to wait in Lafayette Park'' across from the White House.
   Moreno said he saw Wallach enter the White House and when he
emerged two hours later, Wallach ``said he talked to his friend
over there.''
   Moreno said he understood that Wallach's friend was Meese, who
was then presidential counselor.
   Wallach said they would try to get another assistant Commerce
secretary besides Campbell to approve the financing and Moreno said
he was told to call Bragg.
   Moreno said he was told that no assistant secretary could sign
the papers legally but there was a vacancy in the department and
perhaps a new assistant secretary could sign. Two or three days
later the problem was resolved, he said.
   Nofziger was convicted last month of illegal lobbying for
Wedtech and other companies. The conviction is under appeal.
   Last December, a special prosecutor said there was insufficient
evidence to charge Meese in the Wedtech case.

   A small airplane crashed into a
schoolyard moments after pupils were shepherded to their classrooms
at the end of noon recess. The children escaped injury, but the
pilot was critically hurt.
   ``It was the classic case of fate intervening,'' said Kern
County Fire Capt. Tom Pulcher. ``Where his impact point was, eight
minutes prior to that there was a schoolyard full of children.''
   One class barely made it off the playground at North Beardsley
School in time Thursday, fire officials said. The teacher had just
lined her class up and was herding them inside when she heard the
plane coming in.
   ``A small group were still outside,'' said Assistant City Fire
Chief Henry Pacheco. ``She told the kids to run, and they all ran
out of the way.''
   Observers said the fuselage of the single-engine Dornier came to
rest against a breezeway at the grade school one mile south of
Meadows Field, the main airport in this city 100 miles north of Los
Angeles.
   The pilot, Kenneth Dale Howard, 42, of Anchorage, Alaska, was
taken to Kern Medical Center where he was listed in critical
condition in the intensive care unit.
   Howard was making his final approach and preparing to land at
Meadows when his engine lost power, said Wilbur Friend, air traffic
manager for the Federal Aviation administration tower at the
airport.
   A National Transportation Safety Board investigator requested a
blood-alcohol test on Howard after some containers of alcohol were
found at the crash site, Pulcher said. He added there was no
immediate evidence that Howard had been drinking.

<DATELINE>PALMEROLA AIR BASE, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A steady stream of air
transports brought U.S. soldiers and equipment in a show of force
so hastily arranged that American commanders scrambled to develop
training exercises to keep them busy.
   A dramatic air drop of 800 paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne
Division was scheduled for early today.
   Planes later in the day were to bring 1,100 more soldiers from
the 7th Infantry Division in Fort Ord, Calif., completing the 3,000
man deployment ordered by President Reagan to counter what he
called an invasion by Nicaraguan Sandinista troops.
   Hundreds of soldiers on Thursday bedded down in dusty fields
near the airstrip, awaiting orders for training missions which
normally are arranged several months in advance for such exercises.
   ``This exercise got popped on us two days ago,'' said Maj. Mike
Nason, public affairs officer for the 82nd Airborne. ``We're having
to compress all the training arrangements.''
   An example of how the operation was being altered because of the
lack of planning was today's scheduled parachute drop. Normally
that would be the first wave of an airborne assault, but Nason said
the Army needed to use carefully the limited air transport that was
available on such short notice.
   Army commanders met through the day Thursday with their Honduran
counterparts and made plans for the first of a string of joint
exercises.
   Troops were told to expect to spend about 10 days in Honduras,
but military spokesmen said there was no official timetable yet for
them to leave.
   The first joint exercise, a helicopter movement scheduled today,
would take the U.S. troops 25 miles closer to the area where the
White House claims the Nicaraguans have invaded. However, they
would still be more than 100 miles west of the area of reported
fighting.
   Commanders insisted their orders barred them from getting near
the scene of the fighting. However, they said they were prepared to
take action if the orders were made. The troops appeared eager for
action.
   ``We wait for this,'' said Pfc. Dallas Hutchison of Germantown,
Md., who was manning an M-60 machine gun guarding the bivouac site.
   Officers were eager to take advantage of the training exercise
in a year when budget constraints forced them to cancel maneuvers.
   ``Maybe at the highest echelons of the government they have some
political reasons for us to be here. But we see it as a blessing in
disguise,'' Nason said.
   Nason said the division's training budget had been cut 25
percent, and plans for exercises in Panama had been canceled.

   A high-ranking Sandinista
officer flew about 25 journalists, most of them American, to this
rugged outpost on the Honduran border his troops retook from Contra
rebels in a major offensive.
   The reporters were brought in Thursday to see it was quiet in
the jungle region about 175 miles from Managua and told the
offensive had ended.
   About noon, two unidentified jet planes roared in from Honduras
and dropped at least five bombs. The journalists and their hosts
dived for cover, the bombs exploding as close as 70 yards away.
   No one was hurt and nothing at the Sandinista military
encampment damaged.
   The region is where the White House claims Nicaraguan troops
entered Honduras in pursuit of the U.S.-supplied rebels, and the
attack came just hours after the first of 3,000 American troops
began arriving in Honduras in response to the alleged incursion.
   Honduran said it had mounted the attack, but claimed it had
targeted only Sandinista forces in Honduran territory.
   The bombs landed along the narrow Coco River, which marks the
border between the two countries. Puffs of black smoke curled over
the banana trees.
   Lt. Col. Javier Carrion, the deputy chief of the Sandinista
army's general staff, said two bombs landed in Nicaraguan territory
and one in Honduras.
   He said the attack appeared more harassment than an attempt to
hit any specific target. None of the five Soviet-made helicopters
in the area were hit.
   In Washington, Reagan Administration sources who insisted on
anonymity claimed one Soviet-made helicopter was damaged on the
ground in Nicaragua. The Soviet Union suplies the Sandinistas with
military hardware and training.
   Carrion said jets had similarly buzzed the Coco River earlier in
the day.
   He denied that Sandinista troops had crossed the ill-defined
border, but said: ``There are sectors in the mountains here where
you can get lost. It's easy to confuse the topography.''
   President Daniel Ortega has refused to confirm or deny whether
an incursion had occurred. Military officials in Honduras said
their troops were surrounding about 2,000 Sandinista soldiers in
Honduran territory on Thursday.
   Standing in a jungle clearing, Carrion showed the reporters on a
map where he said Sandinista troops had used artillery to destroy
Contra camps along a six-mile route on both sides of the Coco River.
   He said the offensive, begun March 8, was halted on Wednesday on
Ortega's instructions after the Sandinistas had pushed 1,800 rebels
back into Honduras. Carrion said his troops received air support
from Soviet-made heliopter-gunships and AN-46 propeller-driven
planes with bombs attached.
   The Sandinistas killed 92 Contras and wounded 300, but no
prisoners were taken during the eight-day offensive, Carrion said.
   He said it would be difficult for the Contras to return to the
area, which they had used since last year for makeshift camps.
   Carrion said Sandinista troops destroyed 120 plastic and wood
shacks that the rebels had been using to store supplies, for
sleeping and as clinics.

   The order covers foreign fleets that catch yellowfin tuna in
purse seine nets, and requires them to establish dolphin protection
rules similar to those that already cover U.S. fishermen.
   The regulation will take effect in mid-April, and requires that
the rate of dolphins killed by the foreign fleets be reduced to the
U.S. fishing fleet level by 1991, the Fisheries Service said.

<TEXT>
   Former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's ex-wife,
Margaret Kemper, has been charged with marijuana possession, her
lawyer said.
   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police charged her in provincial
court Thursday after obtaining a search warrant to seize a package
at her home in Ottawa last Friday.
   ``She denies the offense and is anxious to get this matter
cleared up in court,'' said the lawyer, Michael Edelson.
   Canadian Press news agency reported that the search warrant said
a police informer in British Columbia offered the tip that Margaret
Kemper would be receiving one pound of marijuana in the mail.
Police then watched for the arrival of a package in Ottawa, the
agency said.
   Ms. Kemper is scheduled to appear in court April 11. A final
trial date has not been set.
   The jet-setting former first lady divorced Trudeau in 1983 while
he was still prime minister, following a stormy marriage and
seven-year separation.
   Young and rebellious, she made headlines frequently, including
when she spent a few days with the Rolling Stones rock group in
Toronto.
   Now 39, she married Ottawa real estate developer Fried Kemper in
1984. After producing an autobiography and a brief career as a TV
talk show hostess, she retired into life as a housewife. She had
three sons with Trudeau and has one son with Kemper.

<HEAD>Study: Education A Key Factor in Return to Work after First Heart
Attack</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Nurses-Heart Disease, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Better-educated people are more likely to return
to work within a year of their first heart attack, says a study
that found the severity of the attack and the nature of the
victim's job to be less important factors.
   The study published in today's issue of the Journal of the
American Medical Association tracked 151 patients, ages 24 to 70,
for one year after they suffered their first heart attack and noted
whether they returned to work.
   ``It seemed to us that many doctors assumed, `Bad heart attack,
he doesn't return to work, good heart attack, he does.' That's just
not so,'' said Dr. G. Richard Smith, one of the study's two authors.
   ``If the patient is well-educated and has a job that is not
physically stressful, there's a good chance they'll go back within
the first year,'' said co-author Diane O'Rourke.
   Smith and Ms. O'Rourke said their study was designed to test the
predictive value of factors raised in previous studies of
heart-attack patients. The study did not find why the level of
education made such a difference, they said.
   But Smith, a psychiatrist and professor at the University of
Arkansas for Medical Sciences, said his ``clinical sense is that
people who finish high school and beyond are able to persevere ...
and are adaptable. All of those areas come into play in health.''
   While there may be some truth to the notion that better-educated
people have less physically taxing jobs, the study was adjusted to
account for those factors, said Ms. O'Rourke, an assistant
professor at the university.
   The profile developed by Smith and Ms. O'Rourke ranked factors
according to their predictive value.
   Educational level was followed by the physical activity demanded
by the job, the severity of the heart attack and the patient's
perception of his health after the attack.
   Of the 109 patients who returned to work, 78 had at least a high
school education and a job that demanded only low levels of
physical activity. Just 15 patients fitting that description did
not return to work within the first year.
   On the other end of the spectrum, 27 patients who failed to
complete high school and had physically taxing jobs did not return
to work within the first year. However, 31 patients in the same
group returned within the year.

   Thousands of peole
prayed, cheered, danced, beat drums and observed other traditions
today as a total eclipse of the sun darkened a wide area of
Indonesia and the southern Philippines.
   The sun was blacked out by the shadow of the moon for up to four
minutes along a 108-mile swath that moved from the Indian Ocean
across Indonesia and the southern Philippine island of Mindanao.
   A partial eclipse was visible across a wide area of Asia as far
west as India _ including Southeast Asia, China, Japan and New
Guinea as well as parts of Australia and the Pacific islands.
   Scientists said the eclipse would end at sunset in the Gulf of
Alaska.
   Clouds obscured the solar spectacular in Jakarta, Indonesia,
Hong Kong and in the eastern Mindanao city of Davao, where
thousands of tourists and scientists had gathered to observe the
eclipse.
   But it was visible for about 3 minutes in this city about 650
miles southeast of Manila despite early scattered clouds. President
Corazon Aquino flew in to witness the event.
   Richard Fisher of the High Altitude Observatory in Boulder,
Colo., said that despite scattered clouds, scientists were
confident they had taken useful pictures of the eclipse.
   In Jakarta, Wilson Sinambela of the National Institute of
Aeronautics said a total eclipse was observed in several parts of
the country, including by about 1,000 tourists in the South Sumatra
capital Palembang.
   He said thousands of Indonesians prayed and beat drums to herald
the start of the eclipse, which began in southwestern Sumatra
before heading on to the Philippines.
   In Kuala Lumpur, where a partial eclipse blocked out about 80
percent of the sun, some Malaysian Hindus visited temples to pray
for protection against harm during the eclipse.
   In Kurukshetra, India, an estimated 1 million pilgrims dipped
into the waters of the sacred Sannihit and Brahmsarover tanks after
a public address system announced the start of the eclipse. Hymns
were chanted and conch shells blown during the ceremony about 90
miles north of New Delhi.
   Clouds blocked the first moments of the eclipse in General
Santos City. But the cloud cover broke, setting off wild cheering
among the thousands who watched the phenomenon in a scorching
tropical heat.
   Street lights switched on, and members of the Naragcas tribe, in
the city for a festival, danced in the streets to the beat of drums.
   In Baguio City, 130 miles north of Manila, pregnant women of the
local Ilocano community rinsed their hair during the eclipse with
water dripped from burned rice straws in a traditional ritual.
   According to local superstition, babies conceived during or
shortly before an eclipse will be deformed unless their mothers
practice the ritual.
   Many other Filipinos marked the eclipse by going to church. The
Philippines is Asia's only predominately Christian country.
   ``This phenomenon is a clear reminder from God for mankind to
repent its sins,'' said Theresa Teopengco, a government employee.
   Officials said about 20,000 tourists and scientists from around
the world had come to the southern Philippines to watch the
eclipse, the last one expected here for at least 50 years.
   Scientists said the area afforded the best opportunity to
witness and study the eclipse because skies are usually clear this
time of year.
   But in Davao City, 60 miles to the northeast, morning clouds
sent hundreds scurrying to the airport for flights to General
Santos.
   Church bells in Davao tolled while police and civilians set off
firecrackers and fired weapons in the air to mark the eclipse.
   In Manila, thousands turned out under clear skies to see the
partial eclipse that blocked about 75 percent of the sun's surface
at its height.
   Police said four people were injured when a passenger bus
collided with a jeep during the eclipse.
   ``The drivers were probably looking skyward when the accident
occurred,'' said policeman Ricardo Manansala. ``It's impossible to
gaze at the sky and drive a vehicle at the same time.''
   Solar eclipses occur when the moon positions itself between the
Earth and the sun. The Chinese first recorded a total solar eclipse
in 2137 B.C., regarding them as signs of a battle to death between
the sun and the dragon.

   Angela Patricia Schembeck's birth
made it a hat trick for the Schembeck family. She became the
third-generation St. Patrick's Day baby of the clan that traces its
roots to Ireland.
   Thursday was her father's 23rd birthday and his father's 47th
birthday.
   ``It's a miracle. It's absolutely incredible,'' said the baby's
father, Kevin Schembeck. ``This is the best birthday present we
could have ever received.''
   Angela arrived three days late at Long Island Jewish Medical
Center.
   The Schembecks, all of College Park, were celebrating in the
nursery with a birthday cake baked by the baby's grandmother.
   ``My mom baked the cake yesterday so it only has my dad's name
and mine on it,'' said Schembeck. ``We'll have to add Angela's name
to it from now on.
   ``What makes this so overwhelming is that it was all natural;
nothing was used to stimulate the labor,'' he said.
   The baby's mother, Doreen, 22, said that when the birth went
past the due date she had a feeling that the baby would be born on
the 17th.
   Schembeck said the mutual birthday has been good for him and his
father, Paul.
   ``It's always been the best day of the year for us,'' said
Schembeck. ``We've always had lots of laughs, lots of parties and
lots of good times.''

   After 60 years in office, Gordon Olson
would gladly give up his post as Cottonwood Lake Township
treasurer-clerk, but instead he has won re-election to yet another
term.
   Not that the job entails all that much responsibility _ the
township only has nine households.
   ``We're about running out of people for these township jobs,''
said Olson, 85. ``We have a few younger people here but they are
young and single; we don't know how long they will be around.
   ``It's just a job, but somebody has do do it.''
   Township Board Chairman Leon Driessen of Butte has been in
office for 44 or 45 years, Olson said.
   ``Mike Nechiporenko, a board supervisor, has quite a few years
in, too,'' Olson said.
   When Olson was first elected township clerk in 1928, his father,
Magnus, was treasurer and Driessen's father, Henry, was acting
chairman. The clerk and treasurer jobs were combined later.
   Twenty-six families farmed in Cottonwood Lake Township then.
Today there are nine families in the township, several of whom no
longer farm.
   People don't turn out for township elections. Usually, the only
voters are the officers themselves, though they say they follow the
correct election procedures anyway.

   Miss America may have been a hit in
Atlantic City. But unless she's a native of the North, she wouldn't
stand a chance in the Fort Yukon Spring Carnival Queen contest.
   Entrants in the annual competition, which beings March 25, must
demonstrate skills that could come in handy in this northeast
Alaska town _ but might not go over too well on national TV.
   First, the tea-making contest. Each of the young women must
build a fire on the snow, melt enough snow to make one cup, boil
the water and brew the tea.
   Then there's the snowshoe race. There's not much call for
three-inch heels in this secluded Yukon River community of less
than 700 people.
   Finally, queen candidates must show their prowess at skinning a
snowshoe hare, known in some parts of Alaska as a ``lowbush
moose.'' Not surprisingly, the event is not a favorite of most
entrants.
   But in other respects, the contest is similar to the Miss
America pageant. All contestants must display some special talent,
answer impromptu questions and appear in an evening gown.
   The winner will preside over the carnival, which runs through
April 2.

<HEAD>Justice Department Says Jury Should Determine Presser's Claims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government lawyers say that deception by a
former FBI agent led to claims by Teamsters President Jackie
Presser that the FBI authorized him to start a union
payroll-padding scheme.
   The Justice Department lawyers said Thursday they believe a
trial jury should determine whether the FBI gave Presser and two
other union officials authorization to allegedly embezzle money
from his own union local's treasury, as Presser's lawyers contend.
   The government ``has taken the position that FBI agents never
authorized any embezzlement,'' the Justice Department's Organized
Crime Strike Force said in documents filed Thursday in U.S.
District Court. It also said the so-called authorization defense
raises ``factual issues which only a trial jury may resolve.''
   Presser, 60, is the leader of the 1.6 million-member union and
also is secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local 507 in Cleveland. He
was indicted on May 16, 1986, on two charges of labor racketeering,
one count of embezzlement, and two counts of filing false reports
with the Labor Department.
   Harold Friedman, Teamsters vice president and Local 507
president, and Anthony Hughes, the local's recording secretary, are
scheduled to stand trial with Presser on July 12.
   The indictment alleged that Presser, in his capacity as a Local
507 officer, masterminded a $700,000 scheme to pay four people who
received union money without doing any work for the union.
   Presser's lawyers say the FBI told Presser, who was an FBI
informant, to pay certain people who had connections to organized
crime so the agency could obtain information from them through
Presser.
   In documents filed with the court March 7, Presser's lawyers
said the government has supplied statements written in 1985 by
former Cleveland-based FBI agents Patrick J. Foran and Martin P.
McCann Jr. that say the agency authorized Presser to make the
payments.
   But prosecutors William S. Lynch, Stephen H. Jigger and Bernard
A. Smith referred to a finding last week by a federal appeals court
in Washington that the authorization defense is a ``tangled web of
deception'' and is ``the product of a calculated lie.''
   The appeals court's finding came in the federal prosecution of
Robert S. Friedrick, a former Cleveland-based FBI agent who was
fired after an indictment alleged he concocted a scheme to avert
the indictment of Presser.
   Most of the evidence against Friedrick was ruled invalid when a
judge found that Justice Department lawyers misled him by making
him believe he was immune from prosecution.

<HEAD>Midwest, South Dusted With Light Snow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A storm dusted the Midwest and parts of the South today with
snow after snapping power lines and closing schools in Arkansas.
   ``There were people who planned to lay out in bikinis, and
they're packing up their snow suits,'' said Donna Dickey, a
University of Arkansas student whose spring break began today.
   The storm knocked out power to about 3,000 homes and businesses
Thursday, Arkansas Power & Light Co. spokesman Charles Kelly said.
   Harrison, Ark., reported 22 inches of snow on the ground, while
most northern parts of the state had 4 to 8 inches.
   Forecasters posted winter storm warnings for nothern Arkansas
and western Kentucky. Snow advisories also were posted for southern
Illinois, western Tennessee, southern Indiana, Ohio, northern West
Virginia and southwest Pennsylvania.
   Early today, snow fell across lower Michigan, southwest Ohio,
Indiana, Illinois, southern and eastern Missouri and northwest
Kentucky. Rain and snow fell across southeast Missouri and
southwest Kentucky. Rain fell in western Tennessee, Arkansas,
Mississippi, Louisiana and eastern Texas.
   Snowfall during the six hours ending at 1 a.m. EST included an
inch at Columbia, St. Louis and Springfield, Mo. During the same
period, Galveston, Texas, had nearly 2 inches, Lake Charles, La.,
had slightly more than an inch and Palacios, Texas, had about
three-quarters of an inch.
   The temperature in Midland, Texas, dropped to 23 degrees, tying
the record low for the date set in 1934.
   In Florida, a cold snap that sent temperatures to record lows
showed signs of easing today. The cold did little damage to crops,
officials said.
   Today's forecast called for snow from southeast Missouri and
eastern Arkansas across much of Tennessee and the Ohio Valley into
the central Appalachians and New York state; snow scattered over
Michigan; rain and thunderstorms from the central Gulf Coast states
across east Tennessee, Georgia and northern and central Florida;
rain spreading east across the Carolinas; and scattered rain along
the middle Atlantic Coast.
   Highs were expected to be in the 40s or 50s in much of the
nation; the 30s from North Dakota across the upper Mississippi
Valley, the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes into northern New
England; the 60s and 70s over the West Coast and western portions
of the Plateau, Florida and southern Georgia; the 60s along the
central Gulf Coast and along the coast of the Carolinas; and the
80s over much of the desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 1
degree below zero at Laramie, Wyo., to 70 at Key West, Fla.

   Alderman Joe Lanahan may no longer have to
worry about which side of the bed he sleeps on.
   Lanahan's right to retain his City Council seat has sparked
heated debate in this St. Louis suburb of 3,800 people since just
after Christmas, when he told the council he had his land surveyed
and found that about half his house was in the city and half in
Madison County.
   Lanahan said he sleeps in the city, however, because the line
falls across one corner at the foot of his bed. He also pays city
taxes.
   The Troy City Council on Thursday unanimously approved an
ordinance requiring city officials to live entirely within city
limits. But all members agreed that if Lanahan annexed the rest of
his property to the city, he could remain an alderman.
   Lanahan said he was pleased with the decision and will seek to
have the section annexed. A crowd of about 50 supporters applauded
when the agreement was finally reached.
   ``This has been a real hassle for us,'' he said. ``I'm glad to
see the support of the people. You really don't know how many
friends you have till something like this happens.''
   Three petitions supporting Lanahan containing 380 signatures
were presented to the council before the vote.

<HEAD>Northern Irish Violence Lends Somber Tone to Parades</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Terrorist violence in Northern Ireland briefly cast a pall over
St. Patrick's Day celebrations in New York, Boston and other
cities, but for most of the more than 1.5 million parade-goers the
usual high spirits flowed freely.
   New York's traditional parade up Fifth Avenue began in midtown
Thursday with somber words from political and religious leaders,
but soon the bands, sunshine and some surreptitious sipping
produced the usual festive atmosphere among the more than 1 million
marchers and watchers.
   More than 200,000 people crowded the sidewalk in downtown
Chicago to watch the 40,000 marchers, 50 floats and 45 bands that
made up the annual parade. Portions of the Chicago River were dyed
green for the day of revelry.
   In Kansas City, Mo., 70,000 Irish and would-be Irish
parade-goers braved a wet snowfall, while 321,000 people thronged
the streets of Savannah, Ga., in the 164th edition of that city's
St. Patrick's Day procession, the second-largest behind New York's.
   New York's Cardinal John J. O'Conner, in his homily at a Mass
preceding the parade, reflected on a terrorist's
grenade-and-gunfire attack on an Irish Republican Army funeral in
Belfast, Northern Ireland, that left three dead and 68 wounded the
day before.
   ``I hope everyone marching will remember those killed, Catholic
or Protestant,'' said O'Connor, who reviewed the parade from the
steps of St. Patrick's Cathedral. ``The violence is insane.''
   O'Connor said New York's parade was not canceled because
``that's not the Irish way.''
   In Boston, where the parade is scheduled for Sunday, Mayor
Raymond L. Flynn said the root of the violence in Northern Ireland
was ``the utter despair that British rule has perpetrated.''
   The crowds, in various shades of green and varying stages of
sobriety, were generally well-behaved and few arrests were
reported. In New York, 15 summonses were issued for drinking in
public, and only one person was arrested for disorderly conduct.
   In Washington, President Reagan proved his Irish wasn't up over
past disputes with Congress when he toasted ``Seamus Wright'' _
otherwise known as House Speaker Jim Wright _ during a Capitol Hill
luncheon.
   Standing Thursday at a table covered with a green cloth and
decorated with green carnations, the president wished Wright ``warm
words on a cold evening and a full moon on a dark night.''
   Wright, who wore a green jacket and green tie, declared that
``we've buried all differences that might exist between political
parties and branches of government on this day of St. Patrick.'' He
toasted Reagan, 77, for his youthfulness.
   Both men have roots in 19th century Ireland. The Irish for James
is Seamus.

   The AIDS virus could spread among American
high school and college students because the young tend not to
believe health warnings are meant for them, according to Surgeon
General C. Everett Koop.
   ``My greatest concern is with the group aged 15 to 24,'' Koop
told a convention of hospital administrators Thursday.
   Officials may have a better idea of the extent of the AIDS virus
among college students by the end of the year as more colleges go
along with a U.S. Centers for Disease Control request to conduct
blind blood testing, Koop said.
   Under such procedures, already used by hospitals in about 40
cities, blood drawn for other purposes is tested for AIDS without
the sample being identified by patient.
   He noted that sexually transmitted diseases in general are
rising at the steepest rate in 16 years ``in spite of the
tremendous educational campaign in 1987, where for the first time
in history we were discussing in the print media and on television
very blunt statements about AIDS and sexually transmitted disease.''
   ``If there is HIV (the AIDS virus) out there, and we know there
is, then there can't help but be some infection going on that we're
not going to see until we get down the road about five years,'' he
told the Federation of American Health Systems.
   It can take five years or more for AIDS to develop after a
person contracts the virus.
   ``So with teen-agers, who think that they're immortal, who
always think the health message is meant for the person next to
them, who have sort of a sense that risk-taking is sort of fun, we
have our most difficult target group, especially with regard to
heterosexual transmission.''
   Earlier, the federal official who oversees the Medicare and
Medicaid health programs for the elderly and poor told the hospital
executives they have been given ``an almost impossible task:
controlling physician decision-making.''
   ``There is deep-seated ambivalence in America about intruding on
physician decision-making,'' said Dr. William L. Roper, head of the
Health Care Financing Administration. ``But we cannot have both
physician autonomy and cost constraint.''

<HEAD>Professor Pleads Innocent To Charges Of Lying About IUD Safety</HEAD>

   A professor pleaded innocent to charges he
lied about the Dalkon Shield's safety when he testified for A.H.
Robins Co. in its attempt to disprove a woman's claim that the
contraceptive device made her sterile.
   Dr. Louis G. Keith remained free on a $10,000 appearance bond
after entering his plea here Thursday. He said he voluntarily took
a leave of absence from Northwestern University in Chicago, where
he teaches obstetrics and gynecology, until the case is resolved.
   Keith testified as an expert witness for A.H. Robins, the
Richmond, Va.-based manufacturer of the device, during trial of the
lawsuit brought against the company by Linda Harre of Tampa five
years ago.
   The 53-year-old professor told the jury he had conducted
experiments that verified the safety of the intrauterine device.
   But a federal indictment announced March 3 contends that Keith
``did not design, direct, conduct or do the scientific experiments
about which he testified.''
   Keith is charged with obstruction of justice and lying eight
times on the witness stand. If convicted on all counts, he faces 45
years in prison and $85,000 in fines.
   The case is being prosecuted by attorneys from the U.S. Justice
Department in Washington.
   Mrs. Harre, 39, alleged the shield made her sterile, but she
lost her $12.5 million lawsuit. She won a new trial in March 1985
when the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta issued an opinion
that attacked the veracity of Keith's testimony.
   Five months later, Robins filed for protection from its
creditors in federal bankruptcy court in Richmond due to the more
than 14,300 lawsuits filed against the company by women who claim
to have suffered pelvic infections, sterility or spontaneous
abortions from using the Dalkon Shield.
   The bankruptcy filing barred future action on the pending
lawsuits.
   Ann C. Tighe, of the Chicago law firm representing Keith, said:
``My client has proclaimed his innocence. We will expect him to be
vindicated.''
   After the brief hearing Thursday, U.S. Magistrate Thomas Wolfson
set the trial for May before Judge William Castagna.

   A black man went to the
gallows alone today after a judge granted a stay of execution to
the ``Sharpeville Six,'' who were aided in their appeal by an
international clemency campaign.
   The pre-dawn hanging of Tsepo Letsoara, 24, concluded without
fanfare, while world leaders, clergymen and politicians continued
to plea with the government to save the ``Sharpeville Six.''
   Letsoara was convicted of the murder of a black woman in a Port
Elizabeth township in October 1985, during nationwide racial
unrest. The victim, Grace Mvetye, was killed by the ``necklace''
method, in which a gasoline-soaked tire was placed around her neck
and set ablaze.
   The ``Sharpeville Six,'' five black men and a woman, would have
joined Letsoara on the gallows today had Pretoria Supreme Court
Justice Willem Human not granted a one-month stay of execution
Thursday. Human made his decision after defense lawyers presented
evidence of perjury by one of the prosecution's chief witnesses.
   Human granted the convicts four weeks to apply for a retrial.
   The case was controversial because the six were convicted under
the principle of ``common cause,'' which held them responsible for
the September 1984 death of town councilor Jacob Dlamini because
they among a mob of 100 that stoned and burned Dlamini to death in
Sharpeville.
   Dlamini was killed on the first day of riots that lasted nearly
three years and claimed more than 2,500 black lives.
   President P.W. Botha had ignored pleas from leaders of most
Western nations and from countries and organizations around the
world to stop the executions. The government said Human's decision
``proves the wisdom of the state president and his ministers in
deciding not to impede the due process of law.
   The government also indicated a link between the scheduled
hangings and a car bomb that exploded Thursday in Krugersdorp,
killing three black people and injuring 20 people. The explosion
occurred in a Magistrate's Court where the Sharpeville Six had been
held briefly between their arrest and trial.
   Police offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to the
arrest of a white man they say is a member of the outlawed African
National Congress. The man was described as the prime suspect in
the bombing.
   Deputy Minister of Information Stoffel Van der Merwe said
neither pressure from overseas nor car bombs would persuade the
government to interfere in a court case.
   The Star, an independent Johannesburg newspaper, reported today
that Botha granted clemency three weeks ago to a black policeman
who was sentenced to death for murdering a youth two years ago in
Mamelodi, the black township outside Pretoria.
   A spokesman for the Department of Justice said Botha commuted
Constable George John Sindane's death sentence to eight years in
prison. The spokesman said Sindane was one of five people whose
death sentences were commuted this year.
   In other developments Thursday,
   _ Attorneys said a $2.25 million wrongful arrest lawsuit was
begun against the Ministry of Law and Order after charges of
sedition and subversion were dropped against a black Roman Catholic
nun and 13 others who lived in black townships outside Krugersdorp.
   Sister Bernard Ncube, president of the Federation of Transvaal
Women, spent 16 months in detention, including 13 in solitary
confinement, after being charged. The state alleged that the group
established ``kangaroo'' courts, campaigned against the police and
initiated a boycott of white-owned shops and buses.
   The charges were dropped Thursday after the prosecution refused
to supply a court with details of the alleged acts.
   _Also, the attorney for freed African National Congress leader
Govan Mbeki said the government denied his request for a passport,
which he sought to visit his three children living in exile.
Attorney Priscilla Jana said no reason was given for the denial.
   Mbeki was freed from prison in November after serving 24 years
of a life sentence for treason and sabotage in connection with his
activities as national chairman of the ANC. His oldest son, Thabo,
is an executive member of the ANC in exile in Lusaka, Zambia.
   Since his release from prison, Mbeki has been restricted to the
Port Elizabeth area, and banned from giving public speeches or news
interviews.

<TEXT>
   An 84-year-old man distracted two
knife-wielding burglars by leading them to a cache of diamonds,
then shot one of them with an old gun he had hidden in a drawer.
   Lou Marks said it was the first time he'd fired the .32-caliber
gun that he had owned for 20 years.
   ``When I put my finger on that gun, I said, `Dear Lord, you have
saved my life,' and I shot him point-blank,'' Marks said Thursday.
``I don't feel a bit of remorse. They weren't going to let me
live.''
   Raymond Edward Sumther, 39, was in stable condition at Bayfront
Medical Center today with bullet wounds in his neck and chest.
Police said he would be charged with armed burglary.
   Gary Glover, a 30-year-old transient Marks said he once helped,
was charged with burglary and booked into the Pinellas County Jail
on $15,000 bail.
   Marks' daughter, Marion Macri, 59, who lives in the house, said
the incident began Wednesday night with a knock on the door. When
her father opened it, two men forced their way in, threw Marks to
the floor and told Mrs. Macri to get down as well. They held the
two at knifepoint, taking $68 in cash from Marks and about $20 from
Mrs. Macri's purse.
   Suddenly Marks remembered he owned a gun.
   ``Then I says, `I've got a lot of jewelry you can have. Take it
and go,''' said Marks, who sells jewelry from his home. ``When I
said, `Follow me, I'll show you my diamonds,' I knew I was halfway
home.''
   As one would-be robber busied himself with grabbing three
quarter-carat diamond rings and loose gems, Marks opened a drawer
he said held more loot.
   It really held the gun.
   ``After I shot him (twice) he just stood there and looked
mortified,'' Marks said. Both men fled. The wounded man was quickly
picked up by police, and the second suspect was found Thursday.
   ``We kind of blame ourselves for letting them in,'' Mrs. Macri
said.

   NBC correspondent John Hart is leaving the
network at the end of the month to pursue other interests.
   Hart, whose thoughtful, poetic style has been featured in his
pieces for ``NBC Nightly News,'' also served as Saturday anchor for
the broadcast and anchors NBC's News Digests.
   Hart joined NBC in 1975 as a political correspondent and later
served as Chief European Correspondent. Before NBC, Hart spent
about 15 years at CBS, serving as Washington anchor and then New
York anchor of the ``CBS Morning News'' from 1968 to 1973.
   Hart said Thursday that the decision to leave ``just kind of
grew over several years. The business changed and I changed and I
guess we changed differently.''
   NBC News President Lawrence K. Grossman said NBC News would
welcome him back if he ever wanted to return. Hart said he didn't
know what he would do yet, except get his hectic life back to
normal.
   Two other prominent network journalists, Bill Moyers and Roger
Mudd, have left network news for public television in recent years,
citing dissatisfaction with the increasing importance of budgets
and marketing in news divisions.
   Hart said such issues affected his decision, but he declined to
discuss them lest appear he was leaving the network with bad
feelings.
   ``I'm not going away mad,'' he said. ``It's really a very
positive step. I'm really grateful to the business for the life
it's given me. I've been able to witness first-hand the major
events in my life. I wouldn't do it differently in any way.''

   Roland Drew, a movie actor who quit
Hollywood in the 1940s for a second career in dressmaking, died at
home of natural causes, his son said. He was 87.
   Drew's roles included that of Prince Baron of Vulcan in the
Flash Gordon serials of the late 1930s which featured Buster Crabbe
as the adventurous Earthman.
   Drew, who died Thursday, received a letter requesting his
autograph as recently as three months ago, said his son, Damon Drew.
   Some of Roland Drew's films, such as ``Hitler, Beast of
Berlin,'' have been shown on local television in recent years.
   The appeal of stardom faded for Drew during the 1940s, and he
quit acting to enter the garment industry as a representative and
maker, his son said. He manufactured women's dresses under the
label Damon Originals.
   As a romantic leading man, Drew co-starred with Dolores del Rio
in the silent film ``Ramona.'' The two later were engaged to be
married, but the romance fizzled, Damon Drew said.
   Roland Drew married Dorothy Dearing, a former Busby Berkeley
girl, in 1946. She died in 1965.
   In addition to his son, Drew is survived by two grandsons.

   A Soviet spacecraft bound for Phobos
will carry a plaque commemorating the Martian moon's discovery in
1877 by American astronomer Asaph Hall.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said Thursday
the Soviets agreed to the idea ``in the continuing spirit of
cooperation in space.''
   The Phobos mission, scheduled for launch in July, should reach
the Martian moon in the spring of 1989. There will be two
spacecraft, which will enter Phobos' orbit and release probes to
land on the moon.
   The two moons of Mars, Phobos and Deimos, were discovered in
August 1877 by astronomer Asaph Hall of the U.S. Naval Observatory
in Washington, D.C., using a 26-inch refracting telescope.
   NASA on Thursday presented to representatives of the Soviet
Academy of Sciences a photographic transfer on aluminum of Hall's
telescope logbook page dated Aug. 17, 1877. It was turned over at a
lunar and planatary science conference at the Johnson Space Center
in Houston.
   Hall first detected an object moving around Mars on Aug. 11 and
recorded it as a star. The log for the 17th records the position
angles and separations of Phobos and Deimos and notes that Phobos
is ``faint and difficult to observe.'' Three days later, the Naval
Observatory announced the discovery of the Martian satellites and
said they had been named for the horses of Mars, the Roman god of
war.
   NASA said the Soviets have agreed to place an aluminum plaque on
either the main body of one of the spacecraft or on one of the
landing vehicles.

<TEXT>
   Buffalo Bill's buffalo-hide coat, eight
guns and a tomahawk go on the auction block today in the largest
sale yet of Wild West memorabilia collected by the legendary
William F. Cody.
   The 300 items offered for sale belong to San Franciscan Greg
Martin, who acquired the collection after he had been unable to buy
the single item he wanted.
   It was a double-barrel shotgun that brought Martin to a
warehouse in Billings, Mont., last year.
   ``I saw it up in storage ... and my pulse skipped a beat,'' said
Martin, who offered to buy the Westley-Richards English shotgun
inscribed to Cody.
   When the elderly owner refused to sell just one item, Martin
wrote a check for $300,000 for the entire collection and took it
out of storage for the first time in 20 years.
   ``He is the living symbol of the West and one of the most famous
Americans who ever lived,'' said Martin, 49, a gun collector and
aficionado of American history. ``The way we look at the West is
because of how Buffalo Bill showed it to us.''
   The collection, to be auctioned by Butterfield & Butterfield,
includes the buffalo-hide coat worn by Cody and the gun he carried
as a 14-year-old Pony Express rider. Cody's single-action Colt
revolver, the type he used as a U.S. Army scout, is one of eight
guns in the collection.
   Items such as a tomahawk from Cody's friend D.F. ``White
Beaver'' Powell, along with dozens of photographs, show bills and
theater tickets chronicle Cody's life as an Indian fighter, buffalo
hunter and scout who along with shooting champion W. ``Doc'' Carver
founded the first Wild West Show.
   For 11 years, after dime-novel writer Ned Buntline persuaded
Cody to appear in the first ``Scouts of the Prairie'' show, Cody
traveled between Eastern theaters and the plains.
   The collection consists of items preserved by Cody's adoring
sister, Julia Cody Goodman, and includes the Cody family Bible and
letters to Julia in which Cody discussed a troubled marriage, the
death of his son and other intimate events.
   The engraved shotgun, the only item not up for auction, will
remain in Martin's home, a three-story Victorian crammed with
Western artifacts including a likeness of Chief Sitting Bull and
the pearl-handled Smith & Wesson revolvers owned by Annie Oakley.
   Martin, a former real estate broker, once paid $1 million for
Bill Harrah's Pony Express Museum in Reno, and maintains his
collection with the help of his wife, Petra, a former federal judge
in Germany.
   He flew to Billings in search of the collection when he learned
Julia Cody Goodman's daughter, Josie, sold it for $1 to a woman
named Stella Foote to keep it from going to the Cody Museum in
Cody, Wyo., Martin said.
   The collection traveled the world under the sponsorship of the
Department of Commerce before it was placed in storage by Foote.

   Banana slug backers defeated abalone
admirers in an California Assembly battle to name the official
state mollusk.
   Assemblyman Trice Harvey tried in vain Thursday to add the
abalone to a bill that would give the mollusk title to the banana
slug. His amendment failed 36-37.
   ``I feel there should be a sharing of this,'' Harvey said. ``The
banana slug could be the inland mollusk. The abalone can be the
marine mollusk.''
   He said the abalone was deserving because it is ``working hard
to try to save the endangered sea otter.''
   ``The banana slug is yucky. Abalone is delicious,'' he added.
   Assemblyman Byron Sher, author of the banana slug bill, opposed
the amendment, but said, ``I respect Mr. Harvey and enjoy abalone,
or is it the other way around?''
   He said the amendment would be a disservice to the Dynamite
Bluebird troop of Redwood City, which did the research and
convinced him to carry the slug bill.
   Also, he said, ``the abalone is not an accessible mollusk.'' Not
only does it live underwater, but it costs $38 a pound.

   A strong earthquake shook the Japanese capital
before dawn today, rocking skyscrapers, rattling dishes and
injuring at least nine people.
   Japan's Central Meteorological Agency said the tremor registered
6.1 on the Richter scale _ meaning a severe quake. It said there
was no danger of a tsunami, or seismic tidal waves.
   The epicenter was 55 miles below ground in the eastern part of
Tokyo, the agency said.
   The Japan Broadcasting Corp. said nine people suffered injuries
in Tokyo and neighboring areas. Police had no reports of damage.
   Tremors were felt throughout the area and in parts of the Tohoku
region to the north. The quake struck at 5:34 a.m., disrupting
train service throughout the capital just before the morning rush
hour.
   ``I could hear dishes rattling in people's kitchens,'' said a
woman in Kamakura, a southern suburb. ``Trees were shaking and
there was a rumbling sound.''
   Tokyo is on a major western Pacific fault and is
earthquake-prone. Most temblors are mild, causing little or no
damage.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude, so 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than
one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 3.5 can cause slight damage, 4 moderate damage,
5 considerable damage and 6 severe damage.
   The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The poor lose more years of life to diseases,
especially those linked to drinking and smoking, according to a
study comparing death rates and income.
   The study by Oregon officials tried to pin down the effect of
income by focusing solely on one racial group, whites, in one urban
county, Multnomah, which includes Portland, from 1976 to 1984.
   Five income levels were established by the study, published
Thursday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. As income
increased, the study found there was a decrease in ``years of
potential life lost,'' a statistic that assumes each victim would
have lived to age 70.
   The study found that those in census tracts with a median
household income of less than $12,100 per year had a rate of
``years of potential life lost'' that was 50 percent higher than
the overall rate and nearly twice as high as the rate for the
highest income group, above $19,300 a year.
   The greatest difference between the groups was found in deaths
attributed to alcoholism. The lowest income group's rating for
years lost to alcoholism was 3.5 times greater than average and
11.7 times higher than that of the most affluent group.
   ``I think to the extent that Portland and Oregon are like the
rest of the country, we can conclude that people in low incomes
have higher rates of premature mortality overall, and in particular
alcoholism and alcohol-related mortality,'' said Dr. Gus Birkhead,
a CDC epidemiologist.
   ``They also found that chronic obstructive lung disease, which
probably means cigarette smoking, (is more prevalent) in the poorer
group.''
   Birkhead said drinking and smoking may be higher among
lower-income people because of a lack of education about the
dangers of those activities, ``or it could be as a way to escape
the frustrations of life.''
   Poorer people also have less access to medical care, he said.
   The Oregon study noted that past studies of alcholism and income
have prompted theories that doctors are less likely to report
alcholism on the death certificates of affluent people.
   However, the authors said, the Oregon Center for Health
Statistics questions doctors about any cause of death possibly
related to alcohol. The reported death rate for alcoholic liver
disease and cirrhosis was twice as high in Oregon as the national
average in 1984.
   Birkhead said the study suggests that education programs need to
be focused on lower income groups, especially programs about the
health dangers of cigarettes and alcohol.

   Retired Army Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, under
indictment in the Iran-Contra affair, today said he ``absolutely''
doesn't expect to serve time for his role in the secret weapons
deals.
   ``I think the legal system itself is going to see the merit of
our case and will dismiss this indictment very quickly,'' he said
on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''
   Asked if he expected to ``do time'' on the charges, Secord said:
``Absolutely not.''
   ``I don't see any merit whatsoever to the case that's been
brought by the special counsel,'' Secord continued.
   He said his lawyers will argue that independent counsel Lawrence
Walsh ``is running amok and without authority'' in prosecuting the
case.
   ``I think that this is a completely uncontrollable and probably
illegal independent counsel ... trying to justify the expenditure
of millions and millions and millions of dollars of taxpayer's
money and 15 months of effort on a witch hunt,'' Secord said.
   Secord said that in return for doing his duty and responding to
requests from the White House, he finds himself ``trapped by a set
of circumstances which none of us dreamed could ever be
criminalized.''
   ``I guess if I were to write a book, I'd proably entitle it, `If
the phones rings again, don't answer.'''

<TEXT>
   County officials have removed an obstacle
that kept art students from drawing nude models: bathing suits.
   The Cobb County Arts Commission voted unanimously Thursday to
overturn a ban on nude models imposed several weeks ago by
Community Services Department chief Bob Ash. Ash had been concerned
about how the community would perceive nude modeling, even though
it was limited to advanced, adults-only classes.
   Judge Mary Staley, chairwoman of the Arts Commission, said
members realized the value of the nude as art. ``It's a classical
approach to developing your skills as an artist. As long as
precautions are taken to avoid exposing people who do not wish to
be exposed.''
   The commission said nudes could only be used in advanced, adult
arts classes and that warning signs must be posted on classroom
doors. In addition, the panel also voted to require students
between ages 15 and 18 to obtain written parental consent before
they can attend classes with nude models.
   Ash has said he would abide by the arts commission's decision.

<HEAD>Neglected Child Ate Off Floor With Dog, Makes Only Dog-Like Sounds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>METTMANN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 4-year-old boy ate food scraps
on the floor with his family's German shepherd for about a year and
can only howl and whine like a dog because of parental neglect,
police said today.
   The mass-circulation Bild newspaper said the female German
shepherd had ``raised'' the child, but authorities said that was an
exaggeration. Bild identified the boy only as Horst.
   ``The child is unable to speak, because his parents never spoke
to him,'' said Mettmann police spokesman Wolfgang Schauer, adding
the boy only makes dog-like sounds.
   ``The dog had become a bigger part of his (the child's) life
than his parents,'' said the police spokesman in Mettmann, eight
miles from Duesseldorf.
   Schauer told The Associated Press in a telephone interview the
boy routinely shared food scraps with the animal on the kitchen
floor of the family's apartment and that the boy did not know how
to eat at the table.
   Authorities did not release the family's name, but said the
parents were being investigated. Bild said the father was a
30-year-old unemployed butcher.
   The couple routinely left the child alone with the dog in the
apartment during the day, Bild reported.
   The child's grandfather came for a visit last week and found the
youngster on the floor sharing a piece of meat with the dog, the
police spokesman said.
   The grandfather immediately notified authorities, and the child
was taken to a children's hospital in nearby Wuppertal, said
Schauer.
   Bild said the child's only word was ``Asta,'' the dog's name.

   A vessel carrying the first shipment of a
Japanese automaker's U.S.-built cars to Japan has resumed its
interrupted voyage.
   The Green Bay left Portland Thursday night. It originally set
out March 7 from Portland with its cargo of 540 Honda Accord
coupes. It turned back Sunday with a cracked ballast tank and
cracked fuel tank after encountering a storm in the northern
Pacific Ocean.
   Repairs were completed this week at the Swan Island shipyard.
   The ship's owner, Central Gulf Lines Inc. of New Orleans,
declined to specify the cost of repairs or the extent of damages.
   The U.S. Coast Guard revealed the nature of the damage after
inspecting the U.S.-flagged ship.
   A gala reception next Tuesday to welcome the ship at Narashino
Port, east of Tokyo, was rescheduled for April 8.

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tamil rebels armed with pick axes,
swords and daggers killed 13 villagers, military and police sources
said today.
   The attack Thursday occurred near the historic Buddhist temple
town of Digawapi in Ampara district, about 125 miles east of
Colombo, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   More than 110 people, most of them members of the Sinhalese
majority, have been killed in the past 18 days in a series of
attacks and reprisal attacks. Authorities have blamed the violence
on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the largest Tamil militant
group.
   At least six women and two infants were among the victims of the
massacre. Some reports said the toll could be 15, the sources said.
   Tamil extremists used swords and daggers to kill the villagers
because gunshots would have alerted two Sri Lankan military camps
nearby, the sources said.
   The Tigers have been fighting for a separate homeland in the
Northern and Eastern provinces, where most of the Tamils live.
   The attack came hours after a Sri Lankan minister, Gamini
Dissanayeke, returned from India and announced Indian and Sri
Lankan troops will patrol together in the east.
   The Tigers oppose an Indian-sponsored peace accord signed last
July. The accord was designed to end the 4-year-old Tamil guerrilla
war against the Sinhalese-dominated government and the Sinhalese
ethnic group.
   It would grant some autonomy to minority Tamils in the north and
east. More than 50,000 Indian troops are in Sri Lanka to enforce
the India-Sri Lanka peace pact and disarm the Tigers.
   Under the accord, Sri Lankan security forces were confined to
their barracks and only Indian troops were dealing with the Tamils.
   Both Tamil and Sinhalese militants oppose the accord. The Tamil
Tigers have refused to surrender their arms, as called for in the
pact. Many Sinhalese say the accord makes too many concessions to
Tamils.
   India and Sri Lanka both have accused Tamil militants of killing
Sinhalese in retaliatory attacks that began March 2 with the
killing of 18 Sinhalese in Morawewa village in eastern Trincomalee
district.
   On March 4, Tamil rebels used land mines to blow up a crowded
truck in the same area. At least 26 Sinhalese died in the explosion.
   A band of men suspected of being Sinhalese extremists then
killed 22 Tamil bus passengers near Horawapotana village, also in
Trincomalee district.
   The predominantly Hindu Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's
16 million people, 75 percent of whom are Sinhalese Buddhists.
Tamils say they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese.

<HEAD>Italian Study Cites Lack of Relationship Between Dioxin and Birth
Defects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A cloud of dioxin spread over an area of Italy by
an industrial accident in 1976 apparently caused no significant
increase in birth defects, according to a six-year study.
   The study reported in today's edition of the Journal of the
American Medical Association focused on babies born in and around
Seveso, Italy, from 1977 through 1982. Another study in today's
Journal reported that a blood test developed in Sweden might
simplify the job of determining how many Vietnam veterans have been
exposed to the defoliant Agent Orange.
   The blood test is less expensive and less invasive than the
standard test of fat tissue, which requires surgery, said Wayne P.
Wilson, executive director of the New Jersey State Commission on
Agent Orange.
   A team led by Dr. Peter C. Kahn of Rutgers University compared
both tests in a study involving 27 men and found little difference
in the results.
   Although the tests now can be performed only in Sweden and at
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, Wilson on Thursday, urged
their increased use.
   Dioxin, a byproduct of pesticide manufacture, causes cancer in
laboratory animals, but has not been directly linked to cancers in
humans.
   The July 1976 accident at a chemical factory exposed more than
37,200 residents of Seveso and three neighboring towns in northern
Italy to dioxin _ the largest population ever contaminated by the
chemical.
   The six physicians who performed the six-year study wrote that
it confirms previous analyses which concluded that if there is any
increased risk related to dioxin, ``the overall risk is unlikely to
be large or might be limited to very rare and specific birth
defects.''
   The Italian doctors considered as defects only congenital
malformations that were present and obvious at birth. Congenital
problems that manifest themselves later, such as mental
retardation, were not considered.
   The Seveso Congenital Malformations Registry, established
shortly after the accident, found that in 15,291 births, 742
infants were born with malformations, a rate of 48.5 per 1,000.
   The prevalence of malformations over the same period in a
nearby, uncontaminated area used as a control was 48.8 per 1,000
births, the study found.
   The quantity of dioxin released into the environment ``seemed to
be enormous'' but was never precisely determined, according to the
study.
   ``Still more important,'' the study concluded, ``is the fact
that no infant with a major malformation was identified in the most
highly contaminated zone.''
   Levels of dioxin concentration found on the ground in the area
surrounding the factory were nearly 1,000 times higher than the
levels termed safe by state and federal officials after a cleanup
at Times Beach, Mo.
   Times Beach is now deserted, and hundreds of families have filed
lawsuits against companies and individuals over exposure to dioxin
contained in waste oil sprayed on their streets as a dust-control
measure in the 1970s.
   Agent Orange, used in Vietnam to eliminate ground cover for Viet
Cong and North Vietnamese troops, contained the most toxic form of
dioxin, 2,3,7,8-TCDD.
   Questions about the effects of Agent Orange exposure have
lingered since the war. Some veterans have sought government
compensation, contending their exposure resulted in cancers,
rashes, headaches, infertility and other side effects, as well as
birth defects in their children.
   The Veterans Administration has rejected the claims, saying
numerous studies have found no link between exposure and reported
symptoms.

<TEXT>
   The Socialist Workers Party, the subject of 16
years of illegal FBI surveillance, claimed victory after the
Justice Department decided to withdraw an appeal and pay a damage
award to the party.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa had awarded the party $264,000
in damages Aug. 26, 1986, ruling that an FBI campaign of
wiretapping, bugging, burglaries, anonymous letters and harassment
was illegal and ``patently unconstitutional.''
   ``The rulings by Judge Griesa are now final,'' Jack Barnes,
national secretary of the party, said Thursday. ``This places a
valuable weapon securely in the hands of every fighter for
democratic rights and political liberties.''
   Amy Brown, spokeswoman for the Justice Department's civil
division in Washington, confirmed that the department notified the
U.S. District Court in New York on Wednesday that it was
withdrawing its appeal.
   She referred a request for comment to Assistant U.S. Attorney
Peter Salerno in Manhattan, who had none.
   ``The Socialist Workers Party, the First Amendment and the rule
of law have won,'' said attorney Leonard B. Boudin of the Political
Rights Defense Fund, which represented the party.
   The case, filed in 1973, challenged an extensive
counterintelligence operation by the federal government to
infiltrate and neutralize organizations suspected of ``subversive
activities.''
   According to the court, the FBI planted 1,300 informers in the
party and its offshoot, the Young Socialist Alliance, between 1960
and 1976, paying them a total of $1.7 million. The FBI committed
193 burglaries and photographed or removed 9,864 party documents,
the judge said.
   The Socialist Workers Party, a Trotskyite offshoot of the
Communist League, claims about 2,000 members nationwide.

   Gunmen wounded a senior police
officer, his chauffeur and two other soldiers in separate attacks
today. The military said arrested a provincial deputy commander of
the communist New People's Army.
   On Thursday, communist rebels killed three people in Manila's
so-called ``war of the streets.''
   Police said gunmen in a speeding car opened fire today on a
vehicle carrying Maj. Pepito Campos and his driver in suburban
Quezon City. Police said the two were wounded, but out of danger at
a local hospital.
   Campos is chief of the special investigations division for the
capital's Northern Police District. Police said a Philippine
Constabulary captain was arrested later as a suspect.
   In a separate incident, gunmen believed to be communist rebels
fired on a car carrying three Philippine Constabulary soldiers in
Manila's Taguig suburb. Two of the soldiers were wounded, police
said.
   On Thursday, two suspected rebels shot and killed Jaime
Javellana, a neighborhood ward leader, as he was walking along a
street in Manila's Santa Mesa district.
   An hour later, four men armed with .45-caliber pistols opened
fire on a jeep near the University of Santo Tomas. Two soldiers,
Sgt. Herman Pascua and Constable Perfecto Terte, were mortally
wounded. A third soldier suffered wounds in the chest and arms but
survived.
   In San Fernando, 40 miles north of here, the Philippine
Constabulary announced the arerest of Elizardo Lapuz, 42, which it
identified as the deputy commander of the New People's Army in
Pampanga province.
   A military statement said Lapuz was arrested late Thursday as he
left his home in the San Fernando area. He offered no resistance.
Pampanga province, which borders Manila to the north, has been a
longtime rebel stronghold.
   In Manila, police said a leaflet left near the scene of the
first shooting said Javellana had been slain by the rebel Alex
Boncayao Brigade because of ``crimes against the people.''
   The brigade is the Manila wing of the communist New People's
Army, which has been waging a 19-year insurgency to establish a
Marxist state. It has claimed responsibility for killing scores of
police, soldiers and government officials in the capital since
President Corazon Aquino took office in 1986.

<TEXT>
   ``Laugh-In'' creator George Schlatter
will produce a one-hour comedy series for NBC this summer called
``Funny People,'' NBC Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff
told advertising executives.
   Schlatter will bring together a cast of comedians for the weekly
show that will premiere Wednesday, July 27. Schlatter previously
produced the landmark comedy hit ``Rowan and Martin's Laugh In''
and ``Real People'' for NBC.
   Tartikoff told 250 advertising executives Thursday at the NBC
studios that the network also would have original episodes of
``Sonny Spoon'' this summer.
   If the Writers Guild of America strike is settled in time, NBC
also plans a new situation comedy during the rerun season, he said.
   Tartikoff, describing his No.1-rated network's coming fall
season during his annual spring preview, said NBC had six series
commitments _ four comedies and two dramas _ with at least 10 other
comedy and 14 drama pilots in the wings.
   The comedy commitments include ``Empty Nest,'' a show about a
Miami doctor with two grown daughters starring Richard Mulligan,
Kristy McNichol, Dinah Manhoff and David Leisure. Mulligan lives
next door to the four women of the ``Golden Girls'' and will have
an occasional romance with Rue McClanahan.
   Other comedy shows include:
   _``Dear John,'' starring Judd Hirsch as a man whose wife walks
out on him and must start life over.
   _``Baby Boom,'' based on the movie starring Diane Keaton. The
show about a career woman who suddenly finds herself with a baby
has not been cast.
   _``Channel 99,'' in which Marilu Henner stars as a woman who
takes over a failing UHF station in New York state.
   ``|attingers'' is a fa|l drama in which Stephen Collins stars as
a restaurateur and man about town in`a Manhattan-based drama that
also stars Blythe Danner and Jerry Stiller.
   ``The Disney Hour,'' which is moving from ABC, will feature a
rotating schedule of series specials, including the return of Fess
Parker as ``Davy Crockett,'' Harry Anderson as the ``Absent-Minded
Professor,'' plus other movies and specials and a third regular
series to be created later.
   Robert Loggia and Lance Guest will star as two FBI agents in the
mini-series ``Favorite Son,'' which was described by Tartikoff as a
back-door pilot, meaning it could be developed into a series
featuring the two G-men.
   Aaron Spelling, whose long-term exclusive commitment to ABC
expired last year, is developing a new show for NBC called
``Nightingales,'' about six young women who are in a student
nursing program.
   Turning to movies planned next year, Tartikoff said Raymond Burr
was returning for three more ``Perry Mason'' films, but he thought
one of them probably would be ``Perry Mason's last case.''
   Tartikoff said NBC was considering at least 20 shows to
counterprogram ABC's 30-hour miniseries, ``War and Remembrance.''
   Among the pilots being considered are ``Flip Side,'' about a
rock legend who comes home to face his three alienated children.
Ex-Beatle Ringo Starr had been cast for the lead role.
   Tartikoff jokingly told the audience Starr had been replaced by
Pete Best _ the original drummer for the Beatles, who was replaced
by Starr.
   Another pilot is being prepared for singer Morris Day, who
starred in ``Purple Rain'' and ``Moving'' and will play a
flamboyant record producer in a new comedy in development.
   Kate Capshaw of ``Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'' stars
in the comedy pilot ``When In Rome,'' about a hotshot New York
newspaper woman who takes over a local newspaper in Rome, N.D.
   Tartikoff said NBC would begin in September with the Summer
Olympics from Seoul, South Korea, then open its regular season with
a special featuring all of its stars at Disneyland, to be followed
by a new ``Davy Crockett'' epsiode.
   NBC also has this year's baseball World Series and football
Super Bowl.

   A senior military official said
today that about 100 suspected members of the Japanese crime
syndicate, the yakuza, slipped into the country and police were
trying to place them under surveillance.
   Philippine Constabulary chief Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano told
reporters in this central port city that the military was having
trouble distinguishing the gangsters among the thousands of
Japanese tourists visiting the country.
   He said local authorities have been coordinating with Japanese
police investigators who are in Manila to track down the gangsters.
   Military intelligence sources say most of the gangsters are in
Manila to buy locally made guns to be smuggled back to Japan.

   Racing legend Mickey Thompson and his wife
may have been murdered in retaliation for Thompson's testimony in a
murder trial that led to the conviction of their slain nephew's
killer, a prosecutor said.
   Orange County Deputy District Attorney Tom Goethals called the
coincidence between the Thompson murders Wednesday and that of
Scott Campbell six years ago ``absolutely incredible.''
   ``First, his nephew is murdered execution-style, then Thompson
and his wife are hit execution-style. The connection just knocks
you right out of your chair,'' Goethals said.
   Authorities called the killings of the millionaire couple an
assassination and said they had no motive for the crime and no
suspects in custody Thursday.
   Investigators are seeking a cyclist who abandoned his bicycle
and flagged down motorists for a ride shortly after Thompson, 59,
and his wife, Trudy, 41, were fatally shot at dawn Wednesday
outside their home in Bradbury, 20 miles northeast of Los Angeles.
   Detectives recovered the 12-speed bike and are checking for
fingerprints and other clues, sheriff's Deputy Van Mosely said.
   Sheriff's officials refused to say whether the man being sought
was one of the cyclists seen fleeing the Thompsons' house, a third
participant in the slayings, or had some other connection to the
case.
   Thompson, the first person to drive a car faster than 400 mph,
was a key witness in the murder trial of Larry Cowell, who was
convicted in 1982 of having Thompson's nephew pushed from an
airplane during a soured drug deal.
   Cowell currently is serving a 25-years-to-life prison sentence
for Campbell's death. Don DiMascio, who was hired by Cowell to kill
Campbell, was convicted last summer of first-degree murder and was
sentenced to life imprisonment without parole, Goethals said.
   ``Knowing the type of people involved in Campbell's murder,
retaliation against Thompson is very possible,'' Goethals said.
``Certainly it is an angle that will be explored.''
   Friends told police that Thompson said he had received several
death threats, but sheriff's investigators said he never reported
them.
   A racing trade group on Thursday put up a $30,000 reward for
information leading to the arrest of those responsible for the
Thompson murders.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hollywood agent Paul Kohner, who represented
such diverse talents as Charles Bronson, Ingmar Bergman and John
Huston, has died of heart failure. He was 85.
   Kohner died Wednesday at University of California, Los Angeles,
Medical Center, said John Strauss, a longtime associate. His wife,
former Mexican film star Lupita Tovar, and family members were at
his bedside.
   Until a recent illness, Kohner headed the Paul Kohner agency,
which celebrates its 50th anniversary in May.
   Throughout his career, Kohner represented hundreds of stars,
espcecially Europeans, including Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich,
Maurice Chevalier, Liv Ullman, Max von Sydow and Klaus Maria
Brandauer.
   In addition to his native Czechoslovakian, Kohner spoke Italian,
German, Spanish, French and English. He frequently traveled abroad.
   Over the past 20 years, Kohner was instrumental in bringing all
of Swedish director Ingmar Bergman's films to the United States,
Strauss said.
   During World War II Kohner helped organize the European Film
Fund, later the European Relief Fund, which provided emigre artists
with financial assistance and help in obtaining visas to come to
the United States.
   Kohner was born in Teplitz Schoenau, in what is now
Czechoslovakia.
   While working as a reporter for his father's film industry trade
newspapers in 1920, Kohner interviewed then-head of Universal
Pictures Carl Laemmle and came away with the promise of a job in
New York.
   He came to the United States the same year and worked in various
departments at Universal, including publicity, promotion,
distribution and production. Eventually he produced
foreign-language films for the studio, both in the United States
and in Europe.
   Among the more important English films he produced were ``The
Hunchback of Notre Dame,'' starring Lon Chaney; ``A House
Divided,'' directed by William Wyler; ``The Chinese Parrot,''
starring Conrad Veidt; and ``Love Me and the World is Mine,''
starring Mary Philbin and Norman Kerry.
   He is survived by his wife; daughter Susan Kohner Weitz; son
Paul J. ``Pancho'' Kohner; four grandchildren and a brother, Walter.
   Funeral services will be Sunday at Hillside Memorial Park.

   Police detained a white man and
black man participating in a church-sponsored interracial exchange
program, an organizer said today.
   Murray Hofmeyr, who is white, and Sandy Lebese, who is black,
were picked up Thursday night in Mamelodi, the main township
outside the capital of Pretoria, according to Rev. Kevin Cochrane,
one of the program organizers.
   Police had no immediate comment.
   In an unusual attempt to break down racial barriers, more than
200 black and white Christians are trading places with each other
this week.
   Hofmeyr was among 170 whites who moved in Wednesday for four
days with black families in Mamelodi. In turn, 40 blacks are living
with whites in Pretoria.
   Hofmeyr, 29, a doctoral candidate in theology, was staying with
Lebese, 31, a field worker with the Pretoria Council of Churches,
in a four-room township house which he shares with nine others.
   Lebese spent seven years in prison, from 1977 to 1983, on a
sabotage conviction.
   Cochrane said Hofmeyr was released this morning, but that Lebese
was still being held. He said he had no information on why they
were detained.
   Security forces set up a roadblock Thursday evening outside a
meeting hall where the group participants had gathered. The
security forces were checking the identity of all people entering
the area.
   One of the principal organizers of the exchange is the Rev. Nico
Smith, a Dutch Reformed minister who has served in Mamelodi since
1982. Two years ago, however, he moved into his parish, becoming
the first white permitted by the government live in a black
township.
   ``The only difficulty has been getting everyone to the right
place,'' Smith said Thursday before Lebese and Hofmeyr were
detained. ``But everyone is getting along just fine.''
   Smith said the goal of the program was to teach both races about
life on the other side of the apartheid barricade.
   Apartheid is South Africa's legal and traditional system of
racial segregation. Under it, the minority 5 million whites control
the government and the economy and maintain separate districts,
schools and health systems. The 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs.
   Before he was detained, Hofmeyr described a night on the town
with Lebese.
   ``We went to several discos last night and at one place they
even introduced me over the loud speaker,'' he said. ``I didn't
have to pay for a single drink all night.''
   Lebese said it was important that whites experience a taste of
township life.
   ``A lot of whites don't even know if it's legal for them to come
to Mamelodi,'' said Lebese. ``They think we're a bunch of dangerous
radicals. This week everyone has a chance to talk in a relaxed
environment.''
   Most South African blacks know more about how whites live than
vice versa because blacks often work at white homes and in white
businesses. Whites seldom venture into black townships.
   ``The whites said they were concerned about living in the
townships, but that their hosts were instantly friendly and open,''
said the Rev. Ivor Jenkins, an aide to Smith. ``The blacks said,
`It's great to be comfortable.'''
   Edgar Molefe, a 20-year-old from Soweto, Johannesburg's main
township, said he had little trouble adjusting to his new
environment.
   ``We had a nice long talk and a great dinner,'' he said,
recalling his healthy appetite during the meal.
   Henry Lederle, a white theology professor, conceded that the
participating whites are those already committed to a
non-segregated South Africa.
   ``The whites still need this type of exposure,'' said Lederle,
42. ``It's one thing to say you want to end apartheid, it's another
to learn about the problems it creates.''
   The four-day exchange program includes socializing, Bible study
and prayer trips throughout the townships. It will culminate Sunday
evening with a barbecue and church service.
   ``This isn't going to solve all South Africa's problems,'' said
Lebese. ``But it will help a few people understand the situation a
little better.''

<HEAD>GEICO Insists Drivers With Radar Detectors Likely To Crash</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Maryland's largest automobile insurer says
drivers who use radar detectors are more likely to speed and crash
and vows to challenge a state order requiring it to accept
applicants who use the devices.
   Associate Deputy Insurance Commissioner Thomas P. Raimondi ruled
Thursday that Washington-based GEICO Corp. could not refuse auto
insurance in Maryland ``based solely upon the use or ownership of a
radar detection device. (The guideline) constitutes an unfair trade
practice.''
   GEICO, formerly Government Employees Insurance Co., which is
licensed to provide auto insurance in 48 states, instituted the
guideline last year. The ruling covers only Maryland and does not
affect GEICO's guideline nationwide.
   GEICO Vice President August Alegi called the ruling ``bizarre''
and ``shocking,'' adding the company will seek an injunction
against Raimondi's order and also will appeal in Baltimore Circuit
Court.
   ``I can't believe that the state is telling people to go out and
kill people and that we can't do anything about it,'' Alegi said.
GEICO, which insures about 220,000 drivers in Maryland, has
received only three complaints in Maryland about the guideline, he
said.
   The Maryland ruling stemmed from a 1987 complaint by an
Ohio-based trade association representing makers and sellers of the
devices. The ruling was the first in the country on the issue, a
lobbyist for the trade association said.
   The auto insurance industry in recent years has become more
concerned about radar detectors, especially since the new 65-mph
speed limit became effective in some areas, said John Cook, vice
president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an
industry-financed study organization.
   GEICO was believed to be the first large insurer to institute
such a guideline, industry groups said. Most companies still assess
risk based on driving records and convictions, said Harvey Seymour,
vice president of the industry-funded Insurance Information
Institute.
   An estimated 80,000 motorists in Maryland and 4 million
nationally use radar detectors; the devices are illegal only in
Washington, D.C., Connecticut and Virginia.

   Prince Charles returned to
Switzerland today to visit a friend who broke both legs in an
avalanche that killed another of the prince's skiing companions and
nearly engulfed him.
   The Queen's Flight plane, flown by Charles, arrived at Zurich
airport at 12:40 p.m., airport officials said.
   Buckingham Palace said the heir to Britain's throne was paying a
private visit to Patricia Palmer-Tomkinson at the hospital in Davos
where she is recovering. She underwent further surgery Thursday.
   Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson and her husband were in the royal party on
the slopes of the Alpine resort of Klosters when the avalanche
struck March 10. The palace said Charles traveled without any other
members of the royal family.
   Meanwhile, the palace refused to comment on a report in the Sun,
a London tabloid, saying a Swiss investigator told it the royal
skiing party was responsible for the snowslide.
   The Sun claimed the finding emerged from what it said was a
scientific investigation by the local chief of ski police,
Christian Kasper.
   Kasper, however, told a reporter: ``I would not say anything
before the investigation was finished.''
   A spokesman for the prosecutor's office, Albert Largiader, said:
``Kasper is a private person. He has nothing at all to do with the
investigation.''
   Charles and five companions were skiing off Kloster's regular
ski runs when the avalanche occurred.
   British Army officer Maj. Hugh Lindsay, 34, was killed, and Mrs.
Palmer-Tomkinson was buried with him in the snow. Charles and the
rest of the party managed to ski clear and were uninjured.

   They're fitting ``Big Stan'' with suspenders to
keep his outerwear on when the hard wind blows. After all, you
can't have someone 1,136 feet tall shedding 275-pound marble slabs.
   ``Big Stan'' is the nickname of the downtown Amoco Corp.
headquarters, formerly the Standard Oil Building. It's the world's
fourth-tallest building, and is in danger of losing some of its
sheathing, officials say.
   As a result, Amoco will install steel ``suspenders'' to keep the
white marble in place, engineering manager Shelby Pierce said
Thursday.
   The sheathing slabs are starting to curl or ``bow'' after 15
years in place, said Pierce. The slabs are 1\-inch thick and
measure 4 feet 2 inches by 3 feet 9 inches. Beginning next week,
workers will begin installing bolted-in stainless steel straps,
one-sixteenth of an inch thick and 2 inches wide, at the southeast
corner of the building at a minimum cost of $1 million.
   ``We're looking at an area where the most severe bows occur,''
he said. ``The southeast corner gets most exposure to sun and
thermal cycles and heavy wind.''
   Pierce said company officials first noticed the problem in 1979.
By last November, the condition of the marble began to worsen, and
officials decided to reinforce the marble.
   While workers spend six weeks reinforcing the southeast corner,
engineers will be checking the rest of the building to see if more
drastic measures need to be taken. If the strapping doesn't work,
Amoco may have to strip the building of its gleaming white facade,
he said.

   A man fell to his death early today after he
apparently jumped from the 86th-floor observation deck of the
Empire State Building and landed on a ledge five floors below,
officials said.
   Steven Murkey, 24, was pronounced dead at 12:25 a.m. today in
the emergency room of Bellevue Hospital Center, the hospital's
night supervisor Robert Frazier said.
   Two witnesses at the observatory saw the man jump, but fled
before police could question them, said police Officer Paul Pisano.
   An ambulance crew called to the skyscraper at 11:38 p.m.
Thursday pulled him inside from a window on the 81st floor,
authorities said.
   Emergency Medical Services Capt. Don Rothschild said the man may
have climbed over a fence around the observation deck of the
102-story building, the city's second-talest and a popular tourist
attraction.
   A security guard at the Empire State Building said no one would
be available from there to answer questions until later today.
   There have been more than 30 suicides at the skyscraper, the
world's tallest when it opened in 1931. It since has been
surpassed, first by the World Trade Center in New York, then by the
Sears Tower in Chicago.
   Most of those who have leaped to their deaths never made it to
the street, landing instead on one of the building's setbacks.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union today praised the
practice of socialist self-management pioneered by Yugoslavia and
said it should prove useful in modernizing the Soviet economic
system.
   In a joint declaration issued as Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev ended a five-day visit to Yugoslavia, the two nations
also signaled other Eastern European nations they are free to
follow ``any paths to socialism'' without fear of Soviet
intervention.
   ``No one has a monopoly over the truth,'' the document declared,
echoing similar pledges Gorbachev made in speeches in Prague a year
ago and in Moscow last November. ``The two sides declare that they
have no pretensions of imposing their concepts of social
development on anyone.''
   It said the ``success of any path to socialism'' is tested by
practice.
   This was the first time that view had been outlined in a formal,
written statement of policy.
   Under socialist self-management, Yugoslavia has begun
decentralizing its economy, giving plants and other enterprises
local control.
   The unsigned document was exchanged by Gorbachev and Yugoslav
President Lazar Mojsov on Tuesday but was withheld until today. It
supersedes landmark declarations issued in 1955 and 1956 formally
acknowledging Communist Yugoslavia's independence from the Soviet
bloc.
   The late Josip Broz Tito's determination to pursue a non-aligned
foreign policy led to his break with Moscow in 1948 and an economic
blockade of Yugoslavia until after the death of Soviet dictator
Josef Stalin in 1953.
   Gorbachev's visit is the first by a Soviet leader here since
Tito's death in 1980. It gave him a first-hand look at a
decentralized economic system that has been developing for more
than 35 years along the lines he is seeking to implement in the
Soviet Union.
   The declaration constitutes his first formal acknowledgement
that the system has applications at home. In its formative years,
self-management was denounced by the Kremlin as heresy and proof
that Yugoslavia was embarked on a revisionist road.
   ``The two sides consider the development of socialist
self-management, in keeping with the specificities of each country,
to be of the highest importance,'' the document said. ``It ensures
the genuine authority of the people and the freedom of the
individual.''
   Earlier in the week, Gorbachev expressed some reservations about
giving enterprises too much independence from central authority.
   At a plant that exports robots to the United States and the
Soviet Union, Gorbachev told the factory's Workers Council, which
has nominal control of the plant, that ``we have to maintain a
regulatory role at the center to safeguard us against mistakes,
particularly because the country of the Soviet Union is so large.''
   But in the declaration, the two sides paid particular tribute to
self-management without corresponding mention of Soviet economic
reforms. Those reforms are known as ``perestroika,'' or
restructuring.
   ``Yugoslavia's experience,'' it said, ``gained in the
development of the political system of socialist self-management,
and the orientation to consistently put into practice the
principles of socialist self-management by the people of the Soviet
Union, open up new possibilities for benefitting from each other's
perceptions on the contemporary forms and methods of functioning of
self-management.''
   The two sides also called for ``a radical reform of
international economic relations.''
   Without making specific proposals, the declaration cited ``the
problem of the enormous foreign debt of most developing countries,
discrimination against them in the field of trade and their limited
access to technical and technological achievements.''
   Yugoslavia is engulfed in its worst economic crisis since World
War II, in part due to the $20 billion it owes Western creditors.
   After delaying his departure for an hour to do some sightseeing
in Dubrovnik, a famed resort city on the Adriatic, Gorbachev and
his wife, Raisa, left Yugoslavia to return to Moscow.
   Earlier, Gorbachev toured a 17th century cathedral in what was
believed to be his first visit to a Roman Catholic church, at least
since taking over as Soviet leader three years ago. As a Communist,
Gorbachev is officially an atheist, although his mother is said to
be Russian Orthodox and reportedly attends church regularly in her
home village in southern Russia.

   Scientists have found they can create
highly accurate animal versions of human diseases by inserting
scrambled genes into unborn mice.
   The new technique should allow researchers in some cases to
create animal models on demand.
   Such laboratory animals have long been important tools for
studying and curing illnesses. But until now, they have been
developed only by breeding animals to bring out naturally occurring
defects.
   In the latest experiments, researchers from the Whitehead
Institute for Biomedical Research at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology produced so-called ``transgenic'' mice, animals with an
extra, mutant copy of a normal gene.
   This bad gene contained the same genetic error that causes a
fatal human birth defect called osteogenesis imperfecta Type II. As
a result, the mice were born with rubbery and missing bones, just
like humans with this disorder.
   A report on the research, directed by Dr. Rudolf Jaenisch, was
published in the March 10 issue of the British journal Nature.
   ``This study constitutes the first example of the generation of
an animal model of a human genetic disease by introducing precisely
defined alterations into the normal gene and then transferring the
mutant gene into transgenic mice,'' the researchers wrote.
   At the University of Washington, Dr. Peter Byers said the new
technique should help researchers understand diseases that cause
short stature and a variety of other disorders resulting from
defective genes.
   ``You now have the potential to do that with almost any other
gene in which you can make mutations,'' Byers said. ``It's a way of
finding out more about other genes and their functions.''
   Although many diseases are thought to arise from genetic
defects, the precise genetic causes are still unknown.
   Researchers say it should be possible to tinker with specific
mouse genes, put them into unborn mice and then see if the animals
have diseases that resemble human ailments.
   The MIT research was conducted on the gene that produces Type 1
collagen, a material essential for healthy bones and tendons.
   The human collagen molecule is a chain of 1,000 amino acids. Of
these, 333 are the amino acid glycine. If just one glycine in this
chain is replaced by another amino acid, the collagen is defective
and the disease osteogenesis imperfecta results.
   The blueprint that the body uses to assemble these amino acids
is contained in one gene. If this code is garbled by a single
random mutation, the gene can instruct the body to build collagen
incorrectly, putting glycine in the wrong place.
   The researchers made this kind of mutation in the gene that
produces Type 1 collagen in mice. They transferred the genes into
single-cell mouse embryos.
   The genes produced defective collagen and the mice were born
with the same defects as babies with osteogenesis imperfecta.
   ``Some of them were dramatic,'' Jaenisch said. ``They were
missing bones. You poke their heads, and there is just no bone in
them.''
   Having an animal model for osteogenesis imperfecta should help
researchers learn more about the disease, but it isn't likely to
produce a way to treat it because the defect does its lethal damage
before birth.
   One potential use of the technique, Jaenisch said, would be to
learn how the body uses other kinds of collagen.
   ``There are 20 different collagens, and nobody knows what the
functions of these collagens are,'' he said in an interview. ``For
any of these collagens, this approach will be perfectly suited.''

   A 25-year-old steelworker who had been
recommended for medical retirement after a foot injury walked into
the company doctor's office with a shotgun and killed him,
authorities said.
   Robert Jimenez of Antioch shot Dr. John Irion in the head and
chest Thursday, said Contra Costa County Sheriff's Lt. Telford
Terry. ``He set the shotgun down and waited for the arrival of
sheriff's deputies,'' said Terry.
   Irion, 63, was pronounced dead at his office at the USS-POSCO
Steel plant.
   He had recommended that Jimenez be placed on medical retirement
after a grinding wheel fell on Jimenez's foot at work, crushing it
and causing a severe disability that made him miss work frequently,
Terry said. ``Apparently he was going to be retired and he didn't
want to be retired.''
   Jimenez was taken to the county jail in Martinez and booked for
investigation of murder.
   ``We're just in shock,'' said Calvin Burgess, one of Jimenez's
foremen. He said plant officials met Wednesday to decide whether
Jimenez should return from disability to take on a ``light job'' of
teaching new roll grinders.
   ``But it didn't work out, and the company decided against it,''
he said.
   Company spokesman Earl MacIntyre declined additional comment.

   Former Mayor Dianne Feinstein has been
named to the board of Bancal Tri-State Corp. and its Bank of
California subsidiary.
   ``I'm a private citizen and not looking to make any political
decisions this year,'' she said Thursday after her election to the
board. Feinstein said the job with the San Francisco-based bank is
``an opportunity for me to learn more about a major business in the
Bay area and the state of California.''
   The BanCal holding company, which does business in California,
Oregon and Washington, has approximately $4 billion in assets.
   The board was expanded from 15 to 16 members to make room for
the ex-mayor, who attended her first meeting after her election and
was assigned to the trust committee. Trust operations account for
30 percent of the bank's business.
   ``I'm just a beginner,'' she said later. ``I'm learning.''
   The job pays $10,000 a year plus $500 per board meeting and $400
for each committee meeting, up to a total of $19,000, a bank
spokeswoman said. It marks Feinstein's first professional venture
since leaving office two months ago.

   Israeli troops fired on rock-throwing
demonstrators after Moslem prayers today in the occupied Gaza Strip
and killed one Arab, the army said. Hospital officials said another
18 were wounded.
   In the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah, two young protesters
suffered bullet wounds in a clash with troops following noon prayer
services, a doctor at Ramallah Hospital said.
   One was shot in the abdomen and was in serious condition, while
the other was shot in the leg.
   In all, protests broke out today in a dozen towns and refugee
camps following Moslem noon prayers, repeating a pattern
established during the demonstrations which began Dec. 8.
   A prominent Arab attorney was detained in Gaza, prompting
protests from Israeli liberals, and two senior Cabinet ministers
urged Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin to impose tougher measures
against Palestinian protesters.
   Security forces detained two Israelis found with an arsenal of
weapons and suspected of planning anti-Arab attacks, police said.
The two were identified as Moshe Vinokor of Rishon Lezion and
Gershon Luxemburg of Jerusalem, both 44.
   In the Gaza Strip, army spokesmen confirmed one Palestinian was
killed in a clash at the Shati refugee camp. Officials at Shifa
Hospital identified the victim as 24-year-old Hani Abu Hamam.
   The fatality brought to 101 the number of Palestinians killed in
more than 14 weeks of unrest in the Israeli-occupied territories,
according to U.N. figures.
   Shifa officials said they treated 14 other Palestinians wounded
by gunfire at Shati. Officials at nearby Ahli Arab Hospital said
they treated three other gunshot cases from Shati and one from Gaza
City.
   The army spokesmen said initial reports showed three
Palestinians were wounded in Shati, but they were checking hospital
reports of additional woundings.
   An Arab reporter said he saw troops in Shati fire tear gas,
rubber bullets and live ammunition at hundreds of Palestinians who
threw rocks at soldiers after coming out of the noon prayers at
main Al-Gharbi mosque.
   He said an army helicopter also dropped tear gas on the crowd,
which had been aroused by morning clashes between troops and young
Arabs in the narrow streets of the camp.
   The daily Haaretz quoted Transport Minister Chaim Corfu as
saying troops should shoot stone-throwers through the heart.
   Minister Without Portfolio Yitzhak Modai told the daily Maariv
the disturbances never would have gained strength if soldiers had
fired directly on protesters from the start.
   Mohammed Abu Shaban, the vice president of the Gaza Bar
Association, was picked up late Thursday after a Tel Aviv protest
gathering. Israeli officials alleged he was involved in subversive
activities.
   Abu Shaban has represented several Gazans in appeals to the
Israeli Supreme Court. Tel Aviv University professors and the
left-wing Citizens' Rights Movement protested the detention and
demanded his release.
   Economic boycotts by Palestinians appeared to be having some
effect. Haaretz reported that revenues from a sales and service tax
paid by Palestinians had dropped by 20 percent during the last two
months.
   On Thursday, two masked Palestinians armed with a pistol and a
Soviet-designed Kalashnikov assault rifle shot and wounded an
Israeli civilian in the Gaza Strip for the first time since the
unrest began.
   Also Thursday, Israeli media said Secretary of State George P.
Shultz may return to the region by early April to promote his
Arab-Israeli peace plan.

   University of Colorado regents have voted not to
divest a $300,000 investment in a company doing business in South
Africa.
   The regents voted 7-1 Thursday against divestment, despite
opposition from about 80 students who attended the meeting. Several
of the students staged a one-hour occupation of the room while the
regents broke for lunch.
   Students rushed to the regents' tables and jumped onto them,
breaking one. They rapped regents' nameplates on the table and
tossed papers across the room. Some yelled, ``Free our bloody
dollars.'' No one was arrested.
   CU spokeswoman Pauline Coker said the university's only
investment in a firm doing business with South Africa is slightly
more than $300,000 in Caterpillar Co. bonds that mature in 1992.
   Student Michelle Clifford had said chances the regents would
vote to divest were slim. ``But this is just the beginning,'' she
said.
   About 100 students at CU's Boulder campus staged a ``die-in''
Wednesday in an effort to dramatize South African repression.
Clifford said students carried toy guns and shot others who
pretended to die.
   Up to 130 students have been spending nights in makeshift
shanties for the past two weeks to dramatize opposition to
apartheid. A shanty also was put up on Wednesday in Denver at the
campus shared by the University of Colorado, Metropolitan State
College and Denver Community College.

   Delegates of South Korea's two main
opposition parties ran into trouble today as they tried to forge a
united front against the government.
   They were seeking a merger after Kim Dae-jung quit as president
of the Party for Peace and Democracy Thursday. Kim Young-sam had
resigned as leader of the larger Reunification Democratic Party in
February.
   Both men ran in December's presidential election, dividing
opposition votes and allowing victory for government candidate Roh
Tae-woo. The two Kims had been under pressure since then to step
down and clear the way for a united opposition.
   But the Reunification Democratic Party insisted today it should
have the right to name the main opposition leader and to pick the
lion's share of candidates for National Assembly elections,
expected on April 26. The smaller party, however, insisted on a
strong voice in picking candidates and leadership.
   Announcing its own candidates today for the upcoming election,
the ruling Democratic Justice Party dropped several hard-line
legislators. Party leaders said they were cut in efforts to end
authoritarian rule and advance democracy.
   Roh, a former general, helped former President Chun Doo-hwan
take power in 1980 with military backing. Roh has vowed to
introduce full democracy.
   Meanwhile, the government today stepped up its rhetoric against
communist North Korea. It warned that another provocation like the
December bombing of a South Korean civilian airliner, for which it
blames North Korea, would be viewed as ``a declaration of war.''
   ``We will consider a similar incident like this a declaration of
war against us and mete out strong punishment,'' Defense Minister
Oh Ja-bok told local reporters.
   Oh's statement was one of the strongest warnings against North
Korea since the bombing of a Korean Air jetliner near Burma on Dec.
29. All 115 people on board the flight were killed.
   Oh said 650,000 troops under his command were fully prepared to
crush any North Korean provocation or attack across the border

   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said today
that U.S. soldiers will conduct exercises in Honduras for about 10
days and reiterated that there are no plans for them to engage in
combat.
   A Pentagon spokeswoman, Capt. Nancy LaLuntas, said that 1,062
troops were on the ground in Honduras Thursday night and that all
3,126 were expected to be in place by tonight. Carlucci said on
ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' that only 300 had arrived in
Honduras, but the spokeswoman said that figure was wrong.
   Troops being flown to Honduras included the 82nd Airborne from
Fort Bragg, N.C., and the 7th Light Infantry Division, based at
Fort Ord, Calif.
   ``The plan is for the exercise to last approximately 10 days,''
Carlucci told ABC.
   ``There are no plans for these troops to engage in combat, and
we never comment on contingency plans, of course,'' he said.
   Fighting continues between Nicaraguan government forces and the
Contra rebels, with the U.S.-backed rebels forced to pull back from
some of their positions, Carlucci said.
   ``We don't have an accurate count of casualties, but people are
being wounded and killed,'' he said.
   Carlucci said it was also difficult to tell how many Sandinista
troops had crossed the Honduran border because the incursion was
taking place in a remote area. He said 1,500 to 2,000 Sandinista
troops have been amassed in the border area since March 1.
   Asked if there had been any significant victories or defeats in
the fighting, Carlucci said, ``No, I wouldn't characterize it in
those terms, although the freedom fighters have had to fall back a
bit. They've had to abandon some of their positions and move to
other positions.''
   He said there were no plans to move any other U.S. land, sea or
air forces into the area.
   Carlucci said he was confident the Honduran troops would ``take
whatever measures they consider appropriate to defend themselves.
We stand by to be helpful and we are showing our moral support
through the exercise.''

   A coalition of landlords and developers hopes to
enlist activists for the homeless in a a five-year program to buy
and renovate 5,000 vacant apartments as low-income housing, the
coalition's president said.
   Associated Builders and Owners of New York has created a
not-for-profit corporation called Affordable Alternative Housing
for the Homeless, which would buy buildings, renovate them at an
estimated cost of $85,000 each and turn over management to
organizations for the homeless, Jerome Belson said Thursday.
   In some cases, apartments in occupied buildings would be
designated for the homeless. Buildings could be converted later to
low-income cooperatives.
   Major funding is expected to come from the city and state, the
Daily News reported today. The corporation also has the support of
the Real Estate Board of New York and the Rent Stabilization
Association.
   Deputy Mayor Robert Esnard called the idea ``very interesting,''
and Robert Hayes, founder of the Coalition for the Homeless,
expressed cautious support.

   Bob Dole, battered by Vice President George Bush in a string of
Republican contests, laid off more campaign workers and threw a
Capitol Hill party to thank staff and supporters, but was
tenaciously clinging to his long-shot presidential bid.
   Meanwhile, the Democratic presidential contenders intensified
their criticism of the Reagan administration for deploying U.S.
forces in Central America.
   And Democrat Richard Gephardt dispatched some troops of his own
today _ sending dozens of congressional colleagues to stump for him
in Michigan in a bid to shore up his faltering campaign.
   Michigan holds Democratic caucuses on March 26, and Gephardt
badly needs a win. However, a new poll suggested Gephardt trailed
rivals Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis in the state.
   The survey of 328 likely Democratic voters, conducted for the
Detroit Free Press and WXYZ-TV, indicated Jackson and Dukakis each
had 32 percent, 15 percent were undecided and Gephardt had 9
percent. Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. had 6 percent and Paul
Simon 5 percent, according to the telephone survey, which had a
margin of error of 5.4 percentage points.
   In Washington, Dole campaign spokeswoman Dale Tate said about a
dozen national staff members were told Thursday their jobs would
end at the week's end, and top aides were working without pay.
However, she said Dole was still in the race.
   ``Absolutely, positively nothing has changed,'' said Tate. ``The
senator is on the record about that.''
   After losing the Illinois primary to Bush on Tuesday, Dole
indicated he would stay in at least until Wisconsin's primary on
April 5.
   On the Senate floor Thursday, Dole defended the dispatching of
troops to Honduras, saying Nicaragua's Contra rebels were being
``slaughtered by the hundreds.''
   The U.S. troops were sent to conduct exercises as a show of
strength after Nicaraguan forces chased Contras into Honduras.
   ``Does it make sense, even as thousands of communist troops
cross the border of a free country in this hemisphere, for members
of Congress to make excuses for (Nicaragua's) aggression, while
accusing the president of the United States of fueling the fires of
war in Central America?'' the Republican leader asked.
   Dole said Reagan should immediately resubmit a request for
military aid to the rebels. The Democratic contenders sharply
disagreed.
   ``Our policy in Central America has been one of the worst
fiascos of this administration,'' Dukakis said as he campaigned in
Stratford, Conn., in advance of the state's March 29 primary.
``There is no reason to have troops down there.''
   Sending in the troops was ``excessive and unnecessary,'' Jackson
said at a news conference in Detroit.
   ``We are being told we have to be saved from the Sandinistas,''
Jackson said, adding sardonically: ``There are no Sandinistas in
Detroit.''
   Gore accused the administration of failing to share sufficient
information with Congress about the military move.
   ``We need to know more ... about what our forces will be doing
there,'' the Tennessee senator said as he campaigned Thursday in
wintry Kansas, which holds Democratic caucuses on Saturday. Gore
headed today for balmier climes _ Puerto Rico, which holds its
primary Sunday.
   Gephardt also blasted the administration's actions in Central
America.
   ``In pursuit of its failed policy of support for the Contras,
the administration has lost its sense of direction, abandoned the
rule of law, and failed to protect American national interests in a
troubled region,'' he said.
   Several dozen of Gephardt's House colleagues were campaigning
for him today in Michigan, echoing a tactic used in Iowa, when his
congressional supporters fanned out around the state prior to the
Feb. 8 Democratic caucuses. Gephardt won in Iowa, scoring his
biggest campaign success to date.
   The Missouri congressman was also using another strategy
credited with helping him in Iowa _ tough trade talk.
   At a union hall in Dearborn, Mich., the home of Ford Motor Co.,
Gephardt sounded a familiar theme, criticizing South Korea's trade
practices. A Ford Taurus, he said, would sell for $73,000 in South
Korea as a result of tariffs imposed by that nation.
   ``We're not selling too many of these cars in South Korea. I
wonder why,'' he said.
   While Gephardt was in Michigan, Dukakis was in Washington,
making the rounds on Capitol Hill.
   The Massachusetts governor picked up the endorsements of Sens.
Barbara Mikulski of Maryland and Patrick Leahy of Vermont.
   Dukakis also dropped in on Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, who
said he was ``leaning'' toward supporting Dukakis.
   Jackson, at an Islamic center in Detroit, talked about the
turmoil in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``There is no peace and justice about occupation,'' he said.
``Let the peoples have their land. Let both peoples have their
peace, and give peace a chance.''

<TEXT>
   Producers of a new CBS television comedy show
plan to defy a writers' strike and continue making the show even
after they run out of union-written scripts.
   CBS made the announcement about ``The Smothers Brothers Comedy
Hour'' Thursday, just two days after the Writers Guild of America
rejected pleas from TV producers for special permission to continue
work during the strike.
   The 9,000-member union went on strike against the Alliance of
Motion Picture and Television Producers on March 7 over residuals
from foreign distribution, creative control and a management
proposal to restructure residuals for one-hour TV shows sold into
syndication.
   A session with a federal mediator last weekend failed to end the
dispute, and no new talks are scheduled.
   A CBS spokesman, who talked on condition he not be identified,
said six ``Smothers Brothers'' shows were planned and three scripts
were in hand. When asked what would happen if the strike were still
in progress when it came time for the fourth show, the spokesman
said: ``I can only stand by the statement.''
   ``Production will continue,'' he said, but ``the nature of the
show may change.''
   Under terms of the guild contract, not even cue cards can be
drawn up. Previously, the show's producers said production plans
were postponed because of the strike.
   The WGA, hundreds of whose members picketed the CBS-MTM studios
here Thursday, reacted to the announcement with a warning.
   ``If any writing is done by guild members, they'll be subject to
charges,'' said union president George Kirgo. ``If any writing is
done by non-guild members, well, that's scab writing.''
   The strike has had its biggest impact on talk and variety shows
and has forced some shows into premature reruns.

   Iran said its forces fired 30 missiles
into Iraqi cities today, shot down five Iraqi jets and captured two
Iraqi towns. Persian Gulf shipping sources said the Iranians
attacked three ships and Iraq struck one.
   Iraq said it shot seven long-range missiles into Tehran. Iran's
official media, monitored in Nicosia, reported at least one child
killed and an undisclosed number of civilians wounded.
   The gulf sources said a Japanese seaman was killed aboard the
Panamanian liquified gas carrier Maria 2. The rest of the 20-man
crew abandoned ship when it was set on fire. Three were wounded,
and all were rescued.
   The Iranians, who used speedboats and a frigate, later attacked
the 284,494-ton Norwegian tanker Berge Lord, starting a small fire,
and the 87,768-ton Singapore-flag tanker Neptune Saburu. No
casualties were reported.
   Iraqi warplanes hit at least one tanker off the Iranian coast in
a pre-dawn attack, setting it on fire.
   The official Iraqi News Agency quoted military communiques as
saying another ship was hit in a separate air raid. But there was
no immediate confirmation. The report was monitored in Nicosia.
   Today's Iraqi missile attacks raised to 30 the number of
long-range Al Hussein projectiles Baghdad says it has lobbed into
the Iranian capital since the ``war of the cities'' exploded again
Sunday after a two-day lull.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency said Iranian interceptors
shot down three Iraqi Mirage F-1 fighter-bombers over the northern
gulf today in two separate dogfights. IRNA also was monitored in
Nicosia.
   The agency said all three planes, apparently hit by air-to-air
missiles, crashed into the water, killing the pilots. Iraq usually
uses the French-built Mirages for shipping attacks.
   IRNA said two other Iraqi planes, one a Soviet-built Sukhoi
Su-22 ground-attack jet, were downed by anti-aircraft fire on
strafing missions Thursday and today against Iranian forces
thrusting into northeast Iraq.
   Iran has claimed to have downed nine Iraqi jets in the region
since Sunday. Iraq has not admitted losing any aircraft.
   IRNA said Revolutionary Guards pushing into the mountains of
northeast Iraq recaptured the Iranian border town of Nowsud, held
by the Iraqis since the early days of the 7{-year-old war.
   It said they later overran the ``military towns'' of Tawla,
three miles north of Nowsud, and Byara a few miles further north,
killing or wounding 700 Iraqis and capturing 200.
   The Iranians, driving into the region in a two-pronged offensive
codenamed Val-Fajr-10, claim to have killed or wounded 9,200 Iraqis
and captured 4,000 in heavy fighting since Sunday and seized 328
square miles of territory.
   IRNA reported that a broadside of 24 medium-range missiles was
fired late Thursday and early today into the southern industrial
town of Zubair near Basra and the nearby towns of Haretha and
Shubair.
   The Iranian offensive was seen as retaliation for Iraqi missile
and air attacks on Iranian cities since Feb.29.
   Both sides have reported hundreds of civilians killed in the
attacks.
   Iraq said it has lobbed 101 missiles into Tehran, the holy city
of Qom and the central city of Isfahan in that period.
   Iran said it has fired 36 into Baghdad and the northern city of
Mosul, with dozens of short-range missiles into Basra and other
border towns.
   Both sides have ignored an appeal by United Nations
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar for a cease-fire in the
``war of the cities.''

missions which will deploy a large space telescope, a
communications satellite and a probe to Venus.
   With Thursday's announcement, six crews have been selected for
shuttle missions, which are to resume Aug. 4. The shuttle fleet has
been grounded since the Challenger explosion that killed seven
astronauts in January 1986.
   Shuttle mission STS-29, scheduled for launch Jan. 19, 1989, will
be commanded by Navy Capt. Michael L. Coats. The others are Air
Force Col. John E. Blaha, Marine Cols. Robert C. Springer and James
F. Buchli and James P. Bagian. They will release the third in a
series of Tracking and Data Relay Satellites for communications.
   STS stands for space transportation system.
   Navy Capt. David M. Walker will command STS-30, set for launch
April 27, 1989. With him will be Air Force Col. Ronald J. Grabe,
Air Force Maj. Mark C. Lee, Norman E. Thagard and Mary L. Cleave.
Their mission will start planetary probe Magellan on its way to map
the entire surface of Venus with radar.
   The STS-31 mission will feature deployment of the Hubble Space
Telescope and is set for June 1, 1989. Air Force Col. Loren J.
Shriver will command the flight. The others are Marine Col. Charles

<HEAD>Anencephalic Infant Removed From Life-Support System At Loma Linda</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOMA LINDA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A baby with a fatal birth defect whose
vital organs doctors had hoped to give to others has been removed
from a respirator because he showed no signs of brain death within
a seven-day period.
   The baby, born with a fatal condition known as anencephaly, in
which most of the brain and skull are missing, was taken off a
respirator Thursday, said Loma Linda Medical Center spokewoman
Anita Rockwell.
   ``He is being kept comfortable and is being given fluids,'' she
said.
   Meanwhile, a second anencephalic youngster, known as Baby
Cassandra, entered her second day on a respirator Thursday, and Ms.
Rockwell said she was beginning to show signs of impending brain
death.
   Loma Linda has developed the nation's first medical guidelines
for preserving anencephalics' hearts and other vital organs to be
transplanted to critically ill infants. However, no anencephalic
donor babies have met the hospital's criteria.
   Under the hospital's donor guidelines, infants are placed on
life-support systems for seven days. If doctors determine an infant
is brain dead within that time the hospital will alert organ
procurement agencies nationwide and a search for a suitable
recipient will begin.
   Ms. Rockwell said the criteria for brain death requires that an
infant show an absence of eye reflexes, have dilated pupils, be in
a coma and be unable to breathe on his or her own.
   The life-support system helps prevent the infant's heart, liver
and other vital organs from deteriorating until doctors have
determined that the baby is brain dead.
   The hospital's guidelines, including the seven-day limit on
life-support machines, was devised to address ethical questions
surrounding the use of doomed anencephalics as organ donors.
   If the infant is not declared brain dead within seven days, it
is taken off the respirator and allowed to die naturally without
further consideration as a donor.
   Ms. Rockwell said anencephalic youngsters die very quickly after
being removed from life-support systems.

<TEXT>
   A federal employee fired for refusing to wear a
coat and tie for an identification photograph says he'll appeal,
arguing that the dress requirement is discriminatory.
   Roger Arnold, whose dismissal from his $36,000-a-year job was
effective today, said the controversy was solely over the
photograph, not his attire on the job. He said he has not worn a
coat and tie at work since the late 1970s and last wore a tie at
his son's wedding in 1983.
   ``Ties just don't serve any purpose in my life,'' said Arnold,
50, of Duxbury, an employee of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms who checked wineries, distilleries and firearm
manufacturers for federal license compliance.
   Arnold, a 17-year ATF employee, said his objection to the dress
requirement was based on his dislike for business attire, and the
fact that no clothing requirement was placed on female ATF
employees posing for identification photographs.
   ``Personally, it was a matter of principles,'' said Arnold.
``But when I looked at the regulations, it was apparent they were
discriminatory. It placed all the clothing burden on men.''
   Arnold said he will appeal the dismissal to the Merit Systems
Protection Board and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
   Dot Koester, an ATF spokeswoman in Washington, D.C., said Arnold
is the first ATF employee to be fired over a clothing issue.
   Koester said the government requires coats and ties for
identification photographs but does not have a specific dress code
for the ATF.
   ``We just expect our employees to look and dress like the
professionals they are,'' said Koester.
   She said the issue of Arnold's dress was raised only last year
because a change in ATF identifications required new photographs be
taken.
   Arnold was reprimanded in writing and suspended without pay
twice before his dismissal after he was first asked to wear a coat
and tie in January 1987, said Koester.
   ``This is not something that just came up,'' she said. ``Mr.
Arnold has been fighting us for quite a while.''
   ``It's good to stand up for your principles,'' said Arnold.
``But with no job, things are going to be tight.''

   A black man who was scheduled
to hang with the ``Sharpeville Six'' today went to the gallows
alone after a judge granted a stay of execution for the six.
   The pre-dawn hanging of Tsepo Letsoara, 24, concluded without
fanfare. World leaders, clergymen and politicians continued to plea
with the government to save the five condemned black men and one
woman.
   Barbed wire and police armored vehicles lined the road to
Pretoria Central Prison today.
   The government had ignored an international appeal for clemency
and left the case in the hands of a Pretoria Supreme Court judge,
who on Thursday granted the six a month to appeal for a new trial.
   Attorney Prakash Diar said today the defense team had already
begun preparing a substantive application to reopen the trial and
requestion government witnesses, including one whose admission of
perjury was the basis for the stay of execution.
   Police gave no explanation for the increased security around the
prison. Letsoara was convicted of the murder of a black woman in a
Port Elizabeth township in October 1985, during nationwide racial
unrest. The victim, Grace Mvetye, was killed by the ``necklace''
method, in which a gasoline-soaked tire was placed around her neck
and set ablaze.
   Police have not said whether the slaying was politically
motivated.
   Pretoria Supreme Court Justice Willem Human granted the stay for
the six after defense lawyers presented evidence of perjury by one
of the prosecution's chief witnesses.
   The case is controversial because the six were convicted under
the principle of ``common cause,'' which held them responsible for
the September 1984 death of town councilor Jacob Dlamini because
they were among a mob of 100 that stoned and burned Dlamini to
death in Sharpeville.
   Dlamini was killed on the first day of riots that lasted nearly
three years and claimed more than 2,500 black lives.
   President P.W. Botha had ignored pleas from leaders of most
Western nations and from countries and organizations around the
world to stop the executions. The government said Human's decision
``proves the wisdom of the state president and his ministers in
deciding not to impede the due process of law.''
   The government also indicated a link between the scheduled
hangings and a car bomb that exploded Thursday in Krugersdorp,
killing three black people and injuring 20 others. The explosion
occurred in a Magistrate's Court where the Sharpeville Six had been
held briefly between their arrest and trial.
   Police offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to the
arrest of a white man they say is a member of the outlawed,
anti-apartheid African National Congress. The man was described as
the prime suspect in the bombing.
   Deputy Minister of Information Stoffel Van der Merwe said
neither pressure from overseas nor car bombs would persuade the
government to interfere in a court case.
   The Star, an independent Johannesburg newspaper, reported today
that Botha granted clemency three weeks ago to a black policeman
who was sentenced to death for murdering a youth two years ago in
Mamelodi, the black township outside Pretoria.
   A spokesman for the Department of Justice said Botha commuted
Constable George John Sindane's death sentence to eight years in
prison. The spokesman said Sindane was one of five people whose
death sentences were commuted this year.
   In other developments Thursday,
   _ Attorneys said a $2.25 million wrongful arrest lawsuit was
begun against the Ministry of Law and Order after charges of
sedition and subversion were dropped against a black Roman Catholic
nun and 13 others who lived in black townships outside Krugersdorp.
   Sister Bernard Ncube, president of the Federation of Transvaal
Women, spent 16 months in detention, including 13 in solitary
confinement, after being charged. The state alleged that the group
established ``kangaroo'' courts, campaigned against the police and
initiated a boycott of white-owned shops and buses.
   The charges were dropped Thursday after the prosecution refused
to supply a court with details of the alleged acts.
   _ Also, the attorney for freed African National Congress leader
Govan Mbeki said the government denied his request for a passport,
which he sought to visit his three children living in exile.
Attorney Priscilla Jana said no reason was given for the denial.
   Mbeki was freed from prison in November after serving 24 years
of a life sentence for treason and sabotage in connection with his
activities as national chairman of the ANC. His oldest son, Thabo,
is an executive member of the ANC in exile in Lusaka, Zambia.
   Since his release from prison, Mbeki has been restricted to the
Port Elizabeth area, and banned from giving public speeches or news
interviews.

   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service will take to the airwaves in an effort to persuade more
aliens to tune in to immigration amnesty before the May 4 deadline.
   The INS, in cooperation with a Dallas-based Spanish-language
network, intends to blanket the state with a three-hour broadcast
message Saturday morning, March 26.
   The program will originate at the INS Legalization Center in
Dallas and will be carried on 14 Spanish-language radio stations in
Texas and a 15th station in Albuquerque, N.M.
   Most or all the stations will hold live remote broadcasts from
their local legalization centers and each will go statewide for a
few minutes in a phone linkup, INS spokesman John Armistead said
Thursday in Dallas.
   ``We're going to have a big shindig. It's going to be a giant
promotion,'' said Zoltan Csanyi, news director for KAMA-AM, an El
Paso Spanish-language station. ``We're working with the INS to
promote that fact that the amnesty deadline is near.''
   KAMA will broadcast live from the El Paso legalization center,
Csanyi said.
   The promotion is for people ``who haven't been listening to the
news or who have been putting it off,'' Csanyi said. ``We're here
to tell them time is running out and they have only a few days.''
   Under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, people who
have lived in the United States illegally since before Jan. 1,
1982, can apply for amnesty and obtain temporary residency and the
right to work legally. But they must apply by May 4.
   Amnesty recipients later can apply for permanent residency and
eventually apply for U.S. citizenship.
   INS officials also are answering questions from potential
amnesty applicants on live call-in radio shows during the last
eight weeks of the application period.
   About 20 radio stations belonging to the Spanish Information
Service network carry the weekly call-in show, which will move to a
different location most weeks. It has been broadcast so far from
Houston and San Antonio. Other shows will be broadcast from Dallas
and El Paso.
   During the 55-minute show, INS officials answer questions about
amnesty requirements, paperwork delays, proper documentation and
other topics, SIS reporter Bertha Obregon said.
   ``The response has been incredible,'' Ms. Obregon said. ``About
10 (phone) lines are available, and believe me, we use them all.''

   Police said today they recovered
nearly all of the $8 million that disappeared last month from a
plane carrying the money from the United States to Argentina.
   ``We're counting the money, and very little is missing,'' said
Nilo Augusto Batista, the police official in charge of
investigating the theft.
   One person was arrested before dawn in connection with the
disappearance, and that arrest led to several others, Batista said.
The official said all in custody were Brazilians and that their
names would be released later.
   The money was part of a $52 million shipment from the Federal
Reserve Board in New York to the Central Bank of Argentina that was
stolen sometime between Feb. 4 and 5, said Marven Moss, a spokesman
for Brink's Inc., based in Darien, Conn.
   The money was shipped through Brink's on a routine flight aboard
a commercial airliner in 13 bags and was made up of new,
consecutively numbered $100 bills, Moss said.
   The theft was discovered when the airliner arrived in Buenos
Aires and authorities found only 11 bags. The two missing bags
contained $8 million, Moss said.
   ``Apparently what happened is that some people who were working
at the airport on a temporary basis took the bags and didn't
realize what they took. They thought it was (music) cassettes.
Then, they get home and realize they have $8 million,'' Moss said.
   Batista said the first break in the case came from the Narcotics
Department of the Rio de Janeiro state police.
   ``Even though this case was, technically, not in the drug area,
our people followed the tip, and the result was nearly total
success,'' Batista said.
   He said the missing dollars were traced to several Brazilian
states, where the thieves tried to exchange them, apparently for
other American dollars or for foreign currency.
   ``They didn't get a chance to spend much,'' the official said.
   But Moss said Brazilian drug agents recovered virtually all the
cash today during a drug but. Those who stole the money apparently
used some of the cash to buy drugs, he said. The spokesman didn't
have any more details on the arrest, nor the exact amount of cash
recovered.
   The recovered money belongs to Brink's, since its insurance
repaid the Federal Reserve Board for the theft, Moss said.
   The $8 million heist was the largest in Brink's history, Moss
said.

<DATELINE>CUITO CUANAVALE, Angola (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Military commanders say their
troops around this strategic southern garrison town have repelled
three major offensives since December by combined South African and
UNITA rebel forces.
   The officers also told reporters visiting the front that they
were confident of holding the region despite daily long-range
shelling by South African artillery.
   The officers said Wednesday that they expect more than 7,000
enemy troops to mount another major offensive soon from positions
about 15 miles south of Cuito Cuanavale. The town is 190 miles
north of the border of South Africa-ruled South-West Africa, also
known as Namibia.
   Enemy troops include guerrillas of the National Union for the
Total Independence on Angola, or UNITA, black soldiers from
South-West Africa and South African soldiers.
   Angolan commanders said fighting has died down since their
forces pushed back the South African-led army early this month.
Angolan troops now respond with artillery fire to regular barrages
of South African shells.
   A group of foreign reporters was caught in one such barrage on
Wednesday when it visited a badly damaged steel and wooden bridge
over the Cuito River, a mile south of town.
   ``Fighting picked up around Cuito Cuanavale in December,'' said
Lt. Col. Ngueto, the town's military commander. ``Then the South
Africans brought in mechanized units for their most recent
offensive from Feb. 25 to March 1.''
   ``The enemy has not given up the idea of taking Cuito
Cuanavale,'' he said. ``The same units are still here.''
   Government forces were everywhere in the former farming
community, manning anti-aircraft batteries, tank positions,
defensive trenches and sophisticated radar and communications
equipment.
   Ngueto said the main objective of the South African and UNITA
forces was to capture Cuito Cuanavale's military airport, a key
facility for ferrying government troops and heavy equipment to the
southern front from Luanda. The Angolan capital is 590 miles to the
northwest on the Atlantic coast.
   UNITA, backed by South Africa and the United States, has been
fighting an increasingly effective bush war since 1975 against
Angola's Cuban- and Soviet-backed government.
   ``This airfield can handle an awful lot of traffic and they want
to control it to launch attacks further north in Cuando-Cubango
province and up to central Angola,'' Ngueto said.
   He said South African and UNITA patrols already had traveled
north along narrow corridors through the bush to launch attacks in
the Cuemba region of central Bie province.
   Cuemba, 190 miles north of Cuito, is the farthest South African
troops are thought to have penetrated into Angola since 1976, when
they fought alongside UNITA in the civil war that broke out after
independence from Portugal the previous year.
   Pock marks on the walls of buildings in Cuito indicated they had
been sprayed by small arms fire, but the town has not been taken by
South African or rebel forces, despite long months of siege.
   In December, South African forces blew up two sections of the
Cuito River bridge, which is made of heavy timbers and reinforced
concrete pilings. The Angolans have replaced them with makeshift
ropes and planks that sag down to water level.
   After speaking to government sentries on the east bank of the
river Wednesday, reporters were heading back across the bridge when
the first shell hit about 40 yards away, sending up spray from the
marshy bank.
   Seven more shells exploded as the party scrambled back to an
armored vehicle and drove back through the town.
   ``The South Africans shoot here off and on every day,'' Maj.
Armindo Moreira said as the shells went off. He added that some
residents have had to move away from the river.
   Angolan soldiers and Cuban support troops were seen on the road
out of town for about 15 miles, supporting government statements
that Cuban troops are in the area at the rear of Angolan lines,
about five miles from the front.
   About 40,000 Cuban soldiers are based in Angola, supporting the
government of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.

   Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, D-Colo.,
announced today he would seek a second term in Congress from
Colorado's 3rd District.
   ``You know how hard I worked to get it, and I'll work twice as
hard to keep it,'' Campbell said at a a breakfast meeting of
Democrats.
   Campbell, 54, was elected to Congress two years ago by upsetting
Republican freshman Mike Strang of Carbondale.
   In 1986, he began his campaign by shocking some Democratic
activists when he told the 3rd District nominating assembly to
``put up or shut up'' and donate money to his campaign if he was to
have a fighting chance.
   The necessary money was raised, and Campbell defeated the
better-financed Strang by 6,845 votes out of more than 183,000 cast.
   Campbell is half Northern Cheyenne Indian and sits on the
Council of 44 Chiefs of the Montana tribe. A jeweler who runs a
horse training and raising operation with his wife, Linda, Campbell
has two children, Colin, a freshman at Fort Lewis College, and
Shannan, a high school senior.
   Campbell participated in the 1964 Olympics as a member of the
U.S. judo team, and carried the country's flag in closing
ceremonies.

<HEAD>Nursing Home Owner Pleads Guilty To Inducing Illegal Aliens To

   A nursing home owner has pleaded guilty to
inducing 11 Irish nationals to quit their jobs and illegally enter
the United States to work for him as nurses' aides and orderlies.
   As part of a plea agreement announced Thursday, Peter H. Starr
will be allowed to withdraw his guilty plea if U.S. District Judge
John J. McNaught rejects a government recommendation that Starr
receive a suspended prison sentence and be placed on probation for
three years.
   The deal also calls for Starr to be fined $40,000 and to perform
1,000 hours of community service. McNaught scheduled sentencing for
May 10.
   Starr, 34, owner of the Queen Anne nursing home, was indicted
March 2 and charged with inducing the workers to come to the United
States. He recruited the workers after being warned it was highly
unlikely that they would be issued working permits, the indictment
said.
   Despite the warning, Starr, who had recruited the workers with
an advertisement in a Dublin newspaper, assured them their work
visas were being processed and that the only problem was a delay
caused by passage of the new federal immigration law.
   Because of that purported delay, Starr convinced the 11 workers
to enter the United States on vacation visas. To obtain those, the
workers had to lie and say they never had requested permission to
work in the United States.
   The indictment stemmed from a Labor Department investigation
that began last year after one of the Irish aliens was involved in
a local police investigation.
   The 11 workers cooperated with the investigation and were given
permission to stay in the United States through August. They can
apply for residency status during that period.

<TEXT>
   Opposition lawmakers asked the government
today to investigate whether high-ranking officials were involved
in the 1984 assassination of a Chinese-American journalist in the
United States.
   A former gang member in Taiwan, Tung Kuei-sen, testified
Wednesday in San Mateo County Superior Court in California that he
shot Henry Liu on orders of Chiang Hsiao-wu, son of then-President
Chiang Ching-kuo. Chiang Hsiao-wu was head of Taiwan's secret
police at the time.
   Liu, then 52, was gunned down in Daly City south of San
Francisco just after he finished writing a biography critical of
President Chiang, who died in January of heart failure.
   The attorney for a man convicted of the murder by a court in
Taiwan said today he had evidence that his client, Chen Chi-li, was
acting on orders of ranking Nationalist government officials.
Attorney Chen Shui-pien said he would request the High Court to
reopen its murder trial to allow presentation of new evidence.
   Chen Chi-li, reputed head of the United Bamboo gang, and his
lieutenant, Wu Tun, were convicted by the High Court in 1985 of
murdering the journalist. They testified that they received orders
from Taiwan's chief of military intelligence at the time, Vice Adm.
Wong Hsi-ling, who also was imprisoned in the case. The three are
serving life terms in Taiwan.
   The government has denied involvement in the killing and refused
U.S. attempts to have Chen and Wu extradited for trial in the
United States.
   The four opposition lawmakers today told the Legislative Yuan,
Taiwan's highest law-making body, that the government should not
make any attempt to cover up the killing.
   The lawmakers requested that Chiang Hsiao-wu, the government's
deputy trade representative in Singapore, return to testify at the
Legislative Yuan.
   But Legislative Yuan President Nieh Wen-ya said it would be
inappropriate for the body to hold a hearing on a judicial case
being tried in the United States.

   Former White House aide Oliver L. North gave
an employee of Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot a letter granting
him presidential authority to take $100,000 into Canada as part of
a failed plan to free a U.S. hostage, a published report says.
   The money, provided by Perot, wound up being squandered on high
living by a Canadian who was supposed to help win the release of
Peter C. Kilburn, the librarian at the American University in
Beirut who was kidnapped Dec. 3, 1984, The Washington Post reported
today.
   Kilburn was killed by a Libyan terrorist group in April 1986 in
apparent retaliation for the U.S. bombing of Libya.
   North sent Perot employee Jay Coburn to Canada in January 1986
with a letter on National Security Council stationery that said
Coburn ``is acting on official U.S. Government business on behalf
of the President of the United States,'' according to a copy of the
letter obtained by the Post.
   ``In support of this mission he has the authority to transport
and disburse as necessary, U.S. $100,000,'' the letter said. ``In
the event of emergency or clarification, please contact: Oliver L.
North.''
   Perot had provided the money at North's request, and Coburn
needed the North letter in case U.S. Customs Service agents stopped
him at the border, the Post said.
   Perot said Thursday night that he never questioned his employee
concerning details of the cash delivery and didn't learn until much
later the name of the hostage for whom authorities were negotiating.
   He told the Dallas Times Herald the request for the money came
from the NSC, but that he didn't seek to know details.
   ``This is a small event in a very active life,'' he said. ``They
asked me for it. I delivered it to them and I didn't ask for any
details. They've been calling me on things like this since 1969. It
doesn't matter to me who's president. I did it for a simple reason
_ there was an American over there who needed help.''
   Travelers must file a disclosure statement if they take more
than $10,000 out of the country. Failure to file is punishable by
up to $250,000 in fines and five years in prison.
   Coburn got into Canada without difficulty and in Montreal, he
gave the money to a Canadian citizen who had provided proof of
contact with Kilburn's captors.
   The Canadian said the $100,000 was a down payment and that with
it, he could arrange Kilburn's release for $1 million more, said
the Post, which did not identify the man.
   The Canadian contact took the money, but never came through with
his end of the deal and was later observed by the CIA in Damascus,
spending the money on high living, the Post said, citing
unidentified sources for the information.
   The Post said that a senior FBI official has told Congress that
then-FBI Director William H. Webster _ who is now CIA director _
approved the FBI's participation in the plan. The newspaper said
the plan also was discussed with Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   North has said repeatedly that he had express authority from his
superiors for his actions. But the White House has said Reagan had
no knowledge of any efforts to ransom U.S. hostages in Lebanon.
   North, who was fired from his job as an NSC aide in late 1986
following revelations of the secret sales of arms to Iran and the
diversion of profits from those sales to the Nicaraguan Contra
rebels, was indicted Wednesday.
   He was charged with conspiracy to defraud the government and
commit criminal offenses against it, theft of government property
and wire fraud arising from the diversion of arms-sales proceeds.
   He was named in nine counts charging him with obstruction of
Congress, making false statements, obstructing Meese's Nov. 21-23,
1986, inquiry by making false statements and concealing, falsifying
and destroying classified government documents in NSC files.
   Also indicted Wednesday were former national security adviser
John M. Poindexter and arms dealers Richard V. Secord and Albert
Hakim.

<TEXT>
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman indicated
today that cross-border air raids by Honduras could lead to war
between Nicaragua and the United States, and government media said
young men were volunteering to fight.
   Newspapers called on Nicaraguans to maintain a combat alert in
case U.S. troops invaded from Honduras, where 3,200 American troops
began arriving Thursday.
   The Foreign Ministry blamed the United States for a Honduran
attack on Sandinista army targets and formally protested to
Washington. The raid came less than two hours after the first
American troops landed in Honduras.
   Contra leaders said cease-fire talks scheduled Monday with the
government were off unless the Sandinistas left Honduras.
Nicaraguan radio reported that anti-aircraft batteries fired on two
unidentified aircraft spotted flying in from Honduras on Thursday
night.
   Barricada, the official newspaper of the ruling Sandinista
National Liberation Front, said neighborhood defense committees
held meetings and renewed arms instruction.
   ``The order of the day: Intensify combats,'' read a headline in
Barricada. Newspapers also reported that young Nicaraguan men were
volunteering for military service.
   Alejandro Bendana, secretary-general of the Nicaraguan Foreign
Ministry, told ``CBS This Morning:'' ``The Hondurans attacked,
bombed our position yesterday. This is one step that could lead to
another. Those (American) troops are not there on a sightseeing
mission.
   ``If we don't defend the Central American peace plan, if
Honduras does not shut down the Contra operations and the United
States does not end its military involvement, one step could lead
to another,'' he said in an interview from Managua.
   President Daniel Ortega said Thursday his army was ready to
``combat and liquidate'' U.S. troops if America engaged the
Sandinista forces. But the United States has said American troops
won't go near the area of hostilities, along the
Honduran-Nicaraguan border.
   Sandinista officers said two bombs fell in Nicaragua and a third
landed across the narrow Coco River in Honduran territory on
Thursday afternoon. Reporters taken to the area by a Sandinista
official saw at least five bombs fall, but it was impossible to say
which side of the border they landed on.
   A Reagan administration source in Washington said the Honduran
air force had carried out the attack.
   In Tegucigalpa, a Honduran armed forces spokesman said rockets
were fired at Sandinista forces in Honduran territory, not in
Nicaragua.
   The journalists dived for cover as the jets roared in and the
bombs struck as close as 70 yards away.
   The raid occurred one day after Honduras and the United States
accused Nicaraguan troops of crossing into Honduras in pursuit of
Contra rebels.
   Bendana and Defense Ministry officials have denied the
allegation, and Ortega has neither denied nor admitted it.
   The U.S. soldiers were deployed in what the United States called
a ``measured response'' to the alleged Nicaraguan incursion.
   Ortega said Sandinista troops would not withdraw from
Nicaragua's border and were maintaining an offensive begun March 8,
in which an estimated 2,000 Contras had been pushed out of
Nicaraguan territory.
   Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto said Ortega sent a diplomatic
note to Secretary of State George P. Shultz ``formally and
energetically protesting'' the Thursday attack.
   The note assails what it calls the raid's ``terrorist
character,'' saying the raid ``put in danger the lives of numerous
journalists, including North American citizens.''
   Later, state-run Voice of Nicaragua radio reported that at least
two unidentified aircraft flying in from Honduras were spotted over
the Pacific coast port of Corinto, about 71 miles northwest of
Managua, at 7:05 p.m.
   It said anti-aircraft batteries opened fire on the planes.
   In Miami on Thursday, a Contra leader says truce talks scheduled
to begin on Monday are off unless Sandinista troops withdraw from
Honduras.
   ``If this situation does not take a radical turn, we will not
attend,'' said Aristides Sanchez, a member of the five-member
directorate of the Nicaraguan Resistance, the Contra umbrella
organization.

   The State Department said today that Saudi
Arabia's acquisition of Chinese missiles that can carry nuclear
warheads is a ``disturbing'' development that could harm the
security of all states in the Middle East, including Israel.
   ``The missile system would have a range which would include all
areas of the Middle East,'' spokesman Rudolph Boone said. ``It is
another part of a disturbing regional trend in surface-to-surface
missile proliferation.''
   ``The sum total of the proliferation is a degradation of the
security of all states in the region,'' he said.
   Boone said Saudi Arabia has confirmed it is acquiring the
missile system, which another official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said were Chinese CSS2-class rockets with a range of
2,200 miles and the ability to carry nuclear warheads.
   Several of the missiles are being installed, but it will be some
time before they are operational, the Washington Post reported.
   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said the Saudi
government ``has assured us categorically at the very highest level
that Saudi Arabia does not have, nor does it intend to acquire, any
nuclear capability.''
   Redman told The Washington Post that ``the government of China
has stated categorically that it will not export nuclear weapons to
any government. We accept these assurances in both cases.''
   According to sources quoted by the Post, the Saudis began
negotiating to purchase the missiles from Beijing in 1985 after it
became apparent that the United States, the kingdom's principal
weapons supplier, would be prevented by congressional opposition
from selling Saudi Arabia up to 48 F-15 jet fighters.
   Congress agreed late last year to permit the sale of 24 F-15s on
a replacement basis to keep Saudi air strength at its current
levels.
   The CSS2 is believed to be an offshoot of the rocket used by
China to launch its first satellite in 1970. The Chinese have been
developing various military versions since 1979. Its different
models have ranges running from about 1,000 miles to 2,200 miles,
and the sources said the Saudis are believed to have acquired the
most advanced type.

   Doctors inserted a tiny filter into one of
Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s major veins to intercept any additional
blood clots similar to one that lodged in a lung last week, a
spokesman for Walter Reed Army Medical Center said today.
   Spokesman Jim Steuve said Biden, a Delaware Democrat, was ``in
good condition, alert, happy and in no pain'' after the surgery
Thursday afternoon.
   Steuve said Biden, 45, was eating well and could be expected to
remain in the hospital for several days.
   A catheter was used to insert the device into the vena cava, a
large vein in the abdomen that carries blood to the heart, Steuve
said.
   The purpose of the filter is to catch dislodged clots traveling
in the bloodstream and keep them from damaging the brain, heart,
lungs or other vital organs, he said.
   The clot that lodged in Biden's lung caused no damage and
eventually will be aborbed into the bloodstream, with the lung
acting as a natural filter, Steuve said.
   Biden, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, plans to
return to his home near Wilmington to continue recuperating from
surgery Feb. 12 to correct an aneurysm on a weak wall of an artery
to the brain. A second, smaller aneurysm was found on the opposite
side of his brain, but no date has been set for the second surgery.

<HEAD>Guerrilla-Decreed Transport Ban Makes Salvadorans Walk to Work</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents of the capital walked
to work or paid inflated fares on crowded gypsy vehicles today as a
guerrilla-called transit strike took hold two days before
nationwide elections.
   The U.S.-backed government promised to ensure safe transport in
the face of threats by the leftist insurgents trying to disrupt
Sunday's legislative and municipal voting.
   But none of the privately owned buses _ and few cars _ braved
the streets of San Salvador for what would normally be the morning
rush hour.
   A few pickup and van owners, however, offered rides for up to
six times the normal bus fare of about 10 cents.
   Army trucks loaded with soldiers rumbled through town, and
troops with assault rifles guarded gas stations. The guerrillas
said gas stations selling fuel during the strike would be
considered ``military objectives.''
   The guerrillas have also declared polling places ``military
objectives'' and warned people to stay away.
   The indefinite nationwide strike began at midnight. Police said
two buses headed for the eastern city of Usulutan were stopped by
guerrillas before dawn, emptied and burned.
   The transport ban is the latest chapter in a violent guerrilla
campaign against the elections.
   The rebels say peace should come before elections. They demand a
share of power in exchange for laying down their arms, but the
government of President Jose Napoleon Duarte rejects this.
   The Defense Ministry has said it will deploy 53,000 of its
56,000 troops to safeguard the voting. Defense Minister Gen.
Eugenio Vides Casanova said his men could guarantee voter security
at 244 of the nation's 262 polling places.
   The threat against polling places and service stations came in a
statement from one of the leader of one of guerrilla's new urban
units, the Pedro Castillo Urban Command.
   The command is a unit of the People's Revolutionary Army, one of
five guerrilla groups united in the Faribundo Marti National
Liberation Front. It was not clear if the rebel leader spoke for
the entire front or just his unit.
   It warned people ``to avoid gathering at polling places because,
due to the presence of troops, they ... will be considered military
targets.''
   Channel 6 television broadcast the statement Wednesday and later
provided a transcript to the Associated Press.
   ``The urban commando cells are going to take a series of actions
to repudiate the elections and to repudiate U.S. intervention in
our country,'' the guerrilla leader known as Commander Ester said.
   The United States gave El Salvador almost $600 million in aid
last year, more than it gave any other country in the Western
Hemisphere.
   El Salvador's civil was has claiemd 65,000 lives since it began
in 1979.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government announced today that it
will give illegal aliens who file applications in the last month of
the amnesty program 60 additional days to submit documentation to
support their applications.
   The move is designed to counter criticism from Congress over the
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service's refusal to extend the
May 4 deadline for submitting applications.
   At a news conference, Attorney General Edwin Meese III said the
60-day extension on submitting supporting information will give all
eligible aliens ample opportunity to take advantage of the chance
to become legal U.S. residents. It would apply to applications
submitted between April 4 and May 4.
   ``It is our hope that on May 4 every single person who is
eligible for legalization will have applied,'' Meese told reporters
at an immigration office in Arlington, Va.
   But under the simplified filing policy announced by Meese and
Immigration Commissioner Alan Nelson, applicants will not be
required to produce time-consuming supporting documentation or
medical information for at least 60 days.
   Nelson said that applicants would be scheduled for an interview
after July 5 and that at that time documentation would be required.
   ``The application can be completed in less than 30 minutes,''
Nelson said. ``Without the requirement of immediate documentation,
there is no reason for any qualified applicant not to file by the
May 4 deadline.''
   With six weeks to go, the amnesty program has received just over
1 million applications and will fall short of its early estimate of
2 million.
   Legislation has been introduced in Congress to extend the
deadline for one more year.
   INS officials oppose any extensions.
   Under the program, illegal immigrants who have lived in the
United States since Jan. 1, 1982, can be granted amnesty if they
provide documentation supporting their claim of living here for the
past six years.
   Meese and Nelson also announced another change in the program
which would give private groups more time to locate aliens who are
eligible for amnesty.
   In the past, these private groups assisting the immigration
service collected fees only after they had completed filling out
forms for an applicant, a process that can take three hours or
longer.
   Under the change, the groups will be given a referral fee for
each applicant after they have directed an alien to an INS
legalization office.

   The U.S. Parole Commission has decided to
grant early release from prison to an Indian fisherman and his son
convicted of violating federal wildlife laws in what has become
called ``Salmonscam.''
   Sens. Daniel Evans, R-Wash., and Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, said
in a joint statement Thursday that David Sohappy Sr., 62, will be
eligible for release May 17, and his 29-year-old son, David Jr., on
May 18.
   The commission had set release dates of March 17, 1989, for the
elder Sohappy and Sept. 18, 1988, for his son.
   However, neither Sohappy considered the decision a victory.
   ``A victory would be my walking out of here today,'' said the
elder.
   Both Sohappys have denied any wrongdoing and vowed to continue
their fight for vindication. They have served 18 months of their
30-month minimum sentence at the Geiger correctional facility near
Spokane.
   The Sohappys were among five Yakima Indians convicted of
illegally catching and selling Columbia River salmon and steelhead
trout in 1983.
   A Yakima Tribal Court jury in 1987 acquitted the Sohappys and
three other tribal members convicted in the federal case.
   During the tribal trial, the fishermen argued they were
following ancient religious practices and treaty rights in catching
fish out of season.

<TEXT>
   A giant panda in the wild lives an average of
13 years, which is not as long a some scholars have estimated, a
report said Friday.
   Scholars have debated the life expectancy of the giant pandas,
native only to central and southwestern China, with estimates
ranging from 20 to 30 years.
   The Hong Kong China News Service said Chinese researcher Wei
Fuwen and his colleagues studied the teeth of 69 pandas in their
research. The report did not provide the researchers' exact
affiliation.
   Though the researchers estimated the average lifespan as 13
years, they said some animals could live twice that long.
   China's panda population, just under 1,000, has been declining
in the past five years. The drop has been blamed on a rare
flowering cycle of the arrow bamboo, their dietary staple, which
has caused many plants to whither and die.

   South Korea plans to increase the number of volunteers to 300 by
1992. Each will serve two years abroad.

<HEAD>Traffic Over Jordan River Down to a Trickle</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALLENBY BRIDGE, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fourteen weeks of
unrest and Israeli attempts to quell it have slowed to a trickle
the traffic on this rickety wooden lifeline between Palestinians
and the Arab world outside.
   Both civilian and commercial traffic on the Allenby and nearby
Adam bridges, which span the Jordan River and connect the occupied
West Bank with Jordan, is down by about 30 percent to 40 percent
since the start of what Palestinians call ``the uprising,''
according to a senior Israeli military official.
   Many West Bank merchants, striking under PLO orders, are staying
home to conserve money. In addition, Israeli officials have begun
restricting Palestinians from the territories from crossing the
bridges, and some talk of banning crossings altogether until the
unrest subsides.
   ``To close the bridges, to prevent travel to Jordan, to prevent
the flow of money from Jordan ... That's tremendous pressure,''
Arieh Shalev, former military commander of the West Bank, said on
Israel Radio.
   About 1 million people a year ride buses between Israeli and
Jordanian army emplacements on opposite sites of this 25-yard-long
bridge. Many are Palestinians from both sides who were separated
from their families when Israel captured the West Bank of the
Jordan in 1967.
   Bent old women in long black dresses and white headscarves visit
children. Young Palestinians in jeans travel to jobs in Jordan or
the Persian Gulf. West Bank businessmen tend to shops and bank
accounts across the border. Together, they carry in hundreds of
millions of dollars yearly for the West Bank economy.
   Each day, as many as 120 trucks rumble across the bridges with
West Bank building stones, vegetables and Gaza citrus. The exports
bring about $100 million a year to the territories.
   In 1968, shortly after Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan
and the Gaza Strip from Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war, Israel's
then-Defense Minister Moshe Dayan announced the ``open bridges''
policy.
   For 20 years, the bridges have remained open between two states
still technically at war. For Israel, they symbolize the desire to
maintain normal life for the 1.5 million Arabs under occupation and
to coexist with Jordan.
   But since the uprising, Israeli officials have begun demanding
that residents of the territories present proof of tax payment
before granting bridge permits or export licenses in order to
dissuade Palestinians from following PLO orders not to pay taxes.
   Officials banned cross-bridge exports of stone from the West
Bank village of Qabatiyeh to punish residents there for lynching an
Arab suspected of collaborating with Israel. The Arab had opened
fire on a crowd, killing a child.
   Israel has also limited the amount of money people can bring in
from Jordan without prior permission to 400 Jordanian dinars or
$1,000. The restrictions are aimed at preventing Palestine
Liberation Organization funds from reaching Arab activists in the
territories.
   But the new rules are ominious signs for West Bank money
changers, who are vital to the area's economy, as well as for
families there who depend on funds sent home by hundreds of
thousands of relatives working in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Jordan.
   Many West Bank residents have bank accounts and business
interests in Jordan. Most still carry Jordanian passports.
   But even with permits, travelers from either side must endure
five Israeli and Jordanian checkpoints, as well as rigorous Israeli
inspections of their luggage.
   Many Palestinians in Jordan say they refuse to cross the bridge
because they fear being humiliated by inspectors, who they say
often subject arrivals to strip-searches.
   But Israeli officials say the searches are necessary to prevent
Palestinian activists from smuggling in weapons, which can be
hidden in toys, food or clothes. They say they only conduct body
searches on those who appear suspicious.
   ``You have to see the context of it,'' said an army spokesman
who escorted reporters through the terminal. ``Israel and Jordan
are at war, and yet this (bridge traffic) is still going on.''
   At the barn-like Israeli inspection post near the bridge,
reporters recently saw soldiers sifting through packages of
medicine, throat lozenges, necklaces and hair combs they had
confiscated from Arabs. A Roman Catholic nun who refused to give
her name said inspectors had confiscated church candles and a
rosary.
   The vast structure, often teeming with people, was almost empty.
Soldiers chatted idly over cups of coffee. Five Palestinians sat
waiting to be questioned by authorities about their trips.
   ``We are treated like animals,'' at the bridge, complained
Jerusalem physician Jawad Ghoshe, 45, who said he had visited his
mother and brothers in Jordan. ``I have been waiting for two hours,
and nothing is happening.''

   The woman who admitted injecting
comedian John Belushi with the ``speedball'' of heroin and cocaine
that killed him returned to Canada after waiving a deportation
hearing, an official said today.
   Cathy Evelyn Smith, 40, was put on a flight to Vancouver by
Immigration and Naturalization Service officers, spokesman Ron
Rogers said. ``She was a voluntary deportee. We returned her to her
home country last night, where she is now free.''
   The onetime rock singer was paroled Wednesday from the
California Institution for Women in Frontera, 35 miles east of Los
Angeles, after serving 15 months.
   Facility superintendent Hal Tanner said Ms. Smith had been a
``model prisoner.''
   Ms. Smith was sentenced to prison after pleading guilty to
involuntary manslaughter and three drug charges in the Belushi case.
   Belushi, 33, was found dead March 5, 1982, in a bungalow at the
Chateau Marmont hotel on the Sunset Strip.
   Belushi, the portly comic who gained fame on the ``Saturday
Night Live'' television show and moved on to starring roles in such
movies as ``Animal House'' and ``The Blues Brothers,'' died after a
lengthy drug binge with Ms. Smith and others.
   Ms. Smith later admitted she and the comic injected
``speedballs,'' a mix of cocaine and heroin, but she denied any
responsibility for his death.
   She fled to Canada, but returned in June, 1986 and entered the
guilty pleas to reduced charges.
   Originally, she was charged with second-degree murder and 13
counts of furnishing and injecting Belushi with drugs.

   Retail sales rose 0.4 percent in February, a
slightly smaller increase than reported a week ago, the government
said Friday.
   The Commerce Department said sales last month totaled a
seasonally adjusted $129.12 billion, up $525 million from the
January sales level.
   When the sales data was first released on March 11, the
government reported sales had risen 0.6 percent in February
following a 0.2 percent January decline. The new data shows that
sales were essentially unchanged in January.
   The changes reflect the department's annual benchmark revisions
which update the surveys used to gather information nationwide on
sales. The changes put total retail sales in 1987 at $1.511
trillion, compared with an estimate of $1.506 trillion before the
revisions.

   The White House today denied Nicaraguan
charges that the United States was behind a Honduran bombing raid
on the remote border area where Sandinista troops were skirmishing
with the U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
   Asked whether the Thursday bombing raid indicated that the
United States had asked Honduras to take a more active role, White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We haven't asked them or
instructed them to do anything. We have offered our support and we
have sent our forces there in defense of that.''
   A Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry spokesman in Managua blamed the
United States for the attack, formally protested and warned such
raids could lead to war.
   In Congress, lawmakers were condemning Nicaraguan President
Daniel Ortega as they became convinced he had ordered a military
incursion into neighboring Honduras, an action that renewed calls
for U.S. aid to the anti-Sandinista rebels.
   ``There's a feeling that Mr. Ortega is pretty damn stupid,
indeed,'' said Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., a member of the House
Intelligence Committee who was briefed Thursday on the border
incursion against the Contra rebels.
   ``This so-called final offensive against the Contras may have
made sense militarily, but it was bad politics,'' said Sen.
Claiborne Pell, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.
   Briefings for members of Congress by top Reagan administration
officials portrayed the Sandinista military action as a
long-planned and skillfully executed attack that was threatening a
Contra command center a few miles northwest of Bocay, Nicaragua,
just inside the Honduran border.
   Several moderate Democratic House members, who were behind a
failed March 3 attempt to provide strictly ``humanitarian'' aid to
the rebels, said the move gave new impetus to the effort to pass an
aid package.
   But while there was unanimity that the Managua government had
made a grave political miscalculation, opinions were mixed on the
wisdom of President Reagan's decision to deploy a 3,200-man task
force to Palmerola Air Base in Honduras.
   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci reiterated today that the
troops were there only for ``moral support'' and that they would be
kept away from combat during their 10-day training exercise.
   Of the border clash, Carlucci said information remained sketchy
because of the remoteness of the area. He said fighting had
resulted in casualties, but he did not know how many.
   Interviewed on ABC television, Carlucci was asked whether there
had been any significant victories or defeats in the fighting.
``No, I wouldn't characterize it in those terms, although the
freedom fighters have had to fall back a bit,'' he said. ``They've
had to abandon some of their positions and move to other
positions.''
   Pell, D-R.I., said the move to deploy U.S. troops tended to
reduce Honduras to the status of a U.S. client state and ``may well
be a greater threat to Honduran sovereignty'' than the border
incursion.
   And Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said Reagan's response had
distracted attention from the Sandinista military thrust and cost
the president some political leverage.
   A senior Republican on Pell's committee, Sen. Richard Lugar,
disagreed. He said the troop deployment ``indicates we are still
alert'' to the situation in Central America.
   Lugar predicted that the request for military support ``will not
be the last from Central American democracies.''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
said the deployment was ``obviously designed to impress the
Sandinistas. I hope they get the message.''
   There was conflict, too, on how the developments would affect
cease-fire talks scheduled to resume Monday in the Nicaraguan town
of Sapoa near the Costa Rican border.
   House Speaker Jim Wright said he had high hopes, after talking
to both sides, that the discussions would lead to a cease-fire.
Lugar, however, said the talks ``have become more and more an
academic exercise.''
   In a series of briefings on Capitol Hill, senior administration
officials and intelligence officers said the United States first
detected preparations for the Sandinista incursion late last month,
primarily by observing troop and supply buildups at a base in
northern Nicaragua.
   Roughly a week ago, movements were observed toward Bocay, a
Nicaraguan town in a remote and mountainous area on the Honduran
border. It is unclear exactly when the troops first crossed the
Coco River into Honduras, but Contra forces defending a rebel
command center northwest of Bocay began to encounter government
troops early this week, according to interviews with more than a
dozen participants in the briefings.
   With greater-than-usual precision, some 2,000 Sandinista troops
had by Thursday taken positions to the north, east and south of the
Contras' jungle command and supply post, which was being defended
by about 1,300 rebel troops, the administration said.
   Lawmakers were promised that the U.S. troops, sent from the 82nd
Airborne at Fort Bragg, N.C., and the 7th Infantry at Fort Ord,
Calif., would remain far from the fighting and would not be
involved in combat.
   The administation said sending the forces was a symbolic gesture
of support for Honduran President Jose Azcona, in response to a
direct request from him Wednesday night after several days of
consultations.
   ``Had we said no, you can imagine what it would have done for
our credibility in Central America,'' said Assistant Secretary of
State Elliott Abrams.
   Some in Congress questioned the administration's credibility
anyway, noting that Azcona's written request for help was dated
Tuesday, and the administration had been telling lawmakers that no
such request had been made as recently as Wednesday afternoon.
   Asked today about the complaints, Fitzwater said, ``They were
told exactly what happened, that options were being considered and
no decision had been made.''
   `We feel the consultations were thorough and appropriate,'' he
said. ``A lot of this is just politics, and nothing can be done
about that. Our people felt they were fully responsive.''
   Abrams said the administration is considering a request for new
aid for the rebels. On Feb. 3, Reagan narrowly lost a House vote on
his last such request, and a Democratic alternative was defeated,
216 to 208, a month later. A handful of votes tilted one way or the
other typically determines the outcome on the longstanding and
polarized issue.

<HEAD>UAW OKs Pact At Only U.S. Mazda Plant</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: A version on the financial wire</NOTE>
<DATELINE>FLAT ROCK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Autoworkers at Mazda Motor Corp.'s only
U.S. car assembly plant have ratified a labor contract that will
boost their salaries to levels comparable to workers at Ford Motor
Co., officials said.
   United Auto Workers spokesman Karl Mantyla said 90 percent of
Local 3000 members who voted Thursday supported the contract, which
covers more than 2,000 workers at the plant in Flat Rock, south of
Detroit. The workers make the MX6 for Mazda and the Probe for Ford.
   The agreement, reached Monday, went into effect March 7 and will
run through March 3, 1991. It will give Mazda's U.S. workers wage
parity with Ford workers by 1991, the UAW said.
   ``We are pleased with the results of our negotiations,'' said
Henry G. Schultz, Mazda director of labor relations.
   ``This agreement proves anew that the UAW can work
constructively with anyone who chooses to invest in America and who
seeks a constructive relationship with us,'' said UAW President
Owen Bieber.
   Ford assembly workers, whose UAW contract expires in 1990, earn
an average $14.02 an hour. Mazda workers earn $11.11, which will
grow to at least $14.32 an hour by 1989, UAW spokesman Frank Joyce
said.
   In addition, beginning in 1989, Mazda workers will receive
annual lump-sum payments equal to 3 percent of their wages, the
union said. The average worker should receive about $2,500.
   Ford workers will receive the 3 percent bonuses in the second
and third years of their contract.
   Like the Ford contract, the Mazda contract also includes
cost-of-living adjustments. The Mazda pact also contains a
commitment to provide job security as long as the company remains
competitive, the union and company said.
   If Ford workers win a wage increase in 1990 negotiations, Mazda
workers' salaries will be adjusted to match.
   Employees with three months service prior to negotiation of the
agreement will receive a signing bonus of $750. Other employees
will get $250.
   Mazda also agreed to try to negotiate a profit-sharing plan
while the current three-year agreement is in effect. If
negotiations fail, Mazda has pledged to negotiate a profit-sharing
pact for the next contract.
   In return for the Mazda concessions, the UAW allowed the company
to remain flexible by requiring fewer job classifications and less
restrictive work rules than in other auto plants.
   The UAW has been unable to organize plants in the United States
operated by 100 percent Japanese-owned automakers, including Honda
Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co. Ford owns 25 percent of Mazda.
   ``We are delighted that workers at Mazda's U.S. plant will enjoy
the benefits of a fine UAW contract,'' Bieber said. ``The agreement
breaks new ground in several areas of importance to the union while
assuring Mazda the ability to offer well-built, high-quality
automobiles in the marketplace.''

   It was St. Patrick's Day, but the wearin'
of a leprechaun costume meant ``go home'' for a postal worker.
   A supervisor at the Lansing Post Office sent Diane Horanburg
home after she showed up for work Thursday in costume.
   It was the third time she has been sent home for wearing holiday
clothes. She wore a Santa Claus hat for Christmas 1986 and a
pilgrim dress last Thanksgiving. She said she filed union
grievances both times.
   Horanburg said she wore the leprechaun outfit partly to make the
point that she can wear what she wants at work.
   ``You have to do something once in a while to break the boredom.
I'm not a robot,'' said Horanburg, 31, who helps operate a
letter-sorting machine.
   Don Harants, the post office's director of city operations, said
there is a policy against costumes or loose-fitting clothing that
can become caught in machines.

   Millions of Asians
prayed, pounded drums, and danced in the streets Friday to greet
total eclipse of the sun that drew a curtain of darkness across
land and sea.
   Young Filipinos shot rifles and tossed firecrackers at the
blackened sky. In northern India, thousands of naked men and women
jostled their way into huge, sacred pools to cleanse their souls in
a massive Hindu ritual.
   ``I am at peace today,'' said Ram Avtar, dripping beads of
sacred water in Kurukshetra, India.
   The 27-year-old businessman had journeyed 450 miles to the site
of the two holiest pools to fulfill his late father's final wish: a
dip in sacred waters to seek salvation for his forefathers.
   About one million people waded or dived into Kurukshetra's holy
water.
   The eclipse was the most spectacular along a 108-mile swath that
moved from the Indian Ocean across Indonesia and the southern
Philippine island of Mindanao during the morning hours.
   But a partial eclipse could be seen as far west as India and
eastward into parts of Australia, New Guinea and the Pacific
islands. Scientists said the eclipse would end at sunset in the
Gulf of Alaska.
   Along the 108-mile path, the shadow of the moon darkened the sun
for up to four minutes. Clouds obscured the view in Jakarta,
Indonesia, Hong Kong and in the eastern Mindanao city of Davao,
where thousands of tourists and scientists had gathered to observe
the eclipse.
   Philippines President Corazon Aquino flew to General Davos City,
where it was visible for about three minutes.
   Wilson Sinambela of Indonesia's National Institute of
Aeronautics said a total eclipse was observed in several parts of
his country. He said thousands of Indonesians prayed and beat drums
to herald the start of the eclipse.
   In Hong Kong, hundreds of Chinese went to the space museum to
view the eclipse through telescopes. But clouds prevented them from
doing so. Instead, the museum showed video tapes of previous
eclipses.
   In Baguio City, 130 miles north of Manila, pregnant women rinsed
their hair with water dripped from burned rice straws.
   Local superstition has it that babies conceived during or
shortly before an eclipse will be deformed unless their mothers
practice the ritual.
   In Kurukshetra, amid the chanting of hymns and the blowing of
conch shells, 3,000 naked Hindu holy men were the first to enter
the pools at 6:30 a.m.
   Massive waves of men and women, some clothed, others naked,
followed. The bathers pushed and shoved their way into the pools
that can accommodate only about 125,000 people at a time. The
eclipse lasted only half an hour.
   The scene was repeated, in smaller numbers, at rivers and pools
across India. But Kurukshetra was the most popular because legend
says the Hindu god Lord Krishna once appeared there during an
ancient battle.
   Prasanni Devi said she came to Kurukshetra against the wishes of
her children.
   ``My children do not believe in the holy dictum,'' said the
68-year-old widow, who traveled 235 miles to the holy town.
``Throughout my life I had wanted to come here in the company of my
husband, but he left me alone to get salvation.''
   Divers and lifeguards in boats kept watch over the bathers, but
no trouble was reported.
   In General Santos City, the eclipse set off wild cheering among
the thousands who watched the phenomenon in a scorching tropical
heat.
   Armed troops surrounded the two-story town hall, where teams of
scientists had set up telescopes and cameras. Friday was the 20th
anniversary of the Moslem rebel Moro National Liberation Front
which operates in this area.
   In Zamboanga City, in western Mindanao, hundreds of people fired
weapons in keeping with a superstition that loud noise will scare
the sun from devouring the moon. Police said there were no injuries.
   In Manila, police said four people were injured when a passenger
bus collided with a jeep.
   ``The drivers were probably looking skyward when the accident
occurred,'' said policeman Ricardo Manansala. ``It's impossible to
gaze at the sky and drive a vehicle at the same time.''
   Solar eclipses occur when the moon positions itself between the
Earth and the sun. The Chinese first recorded a total solar eclipse
in 2137 B.C. and regarded it as a battle between the sun and a
dragon.
   The eclipse Friday was the last one in southern Asia for at
least 50 years.

<HEAD>New Season Prepares to Spring Forth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The spring equinox is near, an event that in
centuries past marked the new year for everyone and still does, in
spirit, for many.
   ``The vernal equinox is a marker on the great wheel of time, a
reassurance of order in a world where confusion and disorder too
often seem to have the upper hand,'' observed the late nature
writer Hal Borland.
   ``It is a promise of predictable change, certain as sunrise,
from the rigors of winter to the benevolence of spring. It is
variety in a time of doubt and uncertainty,'' Borland wrote in his
book, ``Twelve Moons of the Year.''
   The actual moment of the grand event occurs this year at 4:39
a.m. EST Sunday, according to astronomers at the U.S. Naval
Observatory here.
   That's the moment that the sun is directly above the equator and
poised to begin bringing its direct rays to the Northern Hemisphere.
   It's called the equinox because it is a time when the hours of
daylight and darkness are nearly equal.
   The amount of daylight has been growing longer since the winter
solstice last December, and will keep doing so until June's summer
solstice, when things start back the other way.
   In Roman times this season marked the new year, and indeed many
countries continued to celebrate new year in March until just a
couple of hundred years ago.
   The observance may well be logical at a time of rebirth, with
winter's chill fading, early flowers coming forth and planting
getting under way for the new crops.
   In fact it is still new year's for some folks: astronomers
measure the length of the year from one vernal equinox to the next.
   But today's popular calendars set forth this equinox as the
start of spring, a widely accepted if not official definition.
   Indeed, the English weather historian Richard Inwards considered
counting this date as the start of spring illogical.
   Better, from his point of view, were either the medieval
reckoning that spring began on Feb. 22, or the farmer's calendar _
still followed by meteorologists _ that counts spring as beginning
March 1.
   Inwards, though, was calculating his seasons according to the
weather in England, which is generally milder than many other areas.
   Generally, spring is a time of gradually gentling weather as the
increasing amounts of sunshine warm and land and people. But the
promise can be a fickle one, suddenly overturned by a stubborn
winter storm.
   Spring, in other words, is where you find it. But at least the
arrival of the equinox is a pleasant reminder that better times are
on the way.

   A Michigan man died Friday from injuries
suffered in a five-story plunge from the observation deck of the
Empire State Building, authorities said.
   Steven Murkey, 24, of Birmingham, Mich., died at Bellevue
Hospital about an hour after he was rescued from an 81st-story
ledge at the 102-story building, said Robert Frazier, night
supervisor at the hospital. Murkey jumped from the 86th floor.
   Emergency Medical Services Capt. Don Rothschild said an EMS crew
responded to a call Thursday night and pulled the man inside from a
window.
   Officer Paul Pisano said two people at the observatory saw the
man jump, but they left before police could question them.
   Rothschild said the man apparently climbed over a fence around
the observation deck, a popular tourist attraction. There have been
more than 30 suicides at the skyscraper, the world's tallest when
it opened in 1931.

   A military official said Honduran
troops were moving along the rugged frontier today and warplanes
were on standby to oust Nicaraguan soldiers.
   On Thursday, Honduran warplanes fired bombs and rockets at
Nicaraguan army targets along the border. The Nicaraguan Foreign
Ministry blamed Washington and delivered a formal protest to the
United States.
   There were conflicting reports about the raids.
   Reagan administration officials said a Sandinista army
helicopter in Nicaragua was destroyed, but Nicaragua denied that.
   Honduras said its air force fired rockets only inside its own
territory.
   The United States deployed 3,200 U.S. troops after reported
incursions into Honduras by Nicaraguan soldiers pursuing Contra
rebels. They included 700 paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne
Division of Fort Bragg, N.C., who dropped into Honduras today from
eight aircraft, said Pentagon spokeswoman Capt. Nancy LaLuntas.
   A high-ranking Honduran military official said Honduran troops
had orders to expel the ``invading troops'' from Nicaragua and that
warplanes were on standby.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said an
estimated 1,000 Sandinistas were reported today on the Honduran
side of border at San Andres de Bocay. The Nicaraguan side is the
site of Sandinista military headquarters in northern Nicaragua.
   The official said two infantry batallions of 1,600 to 2,000
soldiers were moving into the region from a base at Juticalpa,
about 90 miles to the west. He said warplanes were on call from the
Tamara base just north of the capital.
   On Thursday, Honduran military spokesman Manuel Suarez said the
Honduran air force launched air raids on the Honduran side of the
frontier at San Andres de Bocay.
   Reporters flown to San Andres de Bocay saw two unidentified jet
planes roar in from Honduras just after noon and drop at least five
bombs near the border.
   In a telephone interview, Suarez said Honduras rockets destroyed
a Nicaraguan helicopter on a dirt landing strip inside Honduras.
   Suarez did not identify the type of helicopter destroyed.
   He said Nicaraguan forces launched a SAM-7 rocket at the
Honduran jets but the missile missed its target and the Hondurans
fired retaliatory rockets.
   In Washington, sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said
one Soviet-made helicopter was damaged on the ground in Nicaragua.
The Soviet Union has been supplying the Sandinistas with military
hardware.
   In Managua, the Defense Ministry denied that any of its fleet of
more than 40 military helicopters had been destroyed.
   Reagan administration officials say Nicaraguan troops penetrated
Honduran territory in pursuit of the Contras late Tuesday.
   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua has neither confirmed nor
denied that, but he said Nicaragua would continue its Contra
offensive in the border region, which began March 8.
   When he heard of the Honduran attack, Ortega abruptly left a
meeting with representatives of opposition parties in Managua.
Foreign minister Miguel D'Escoto said Ortega had sent a diplomtic
note to Secretary of State George P. Shultz to formally protest the
raid.
   Earlier, Ortega said his army was ``ready to combat and
liquidate the famous forces of the 82nd Airborne Division.''
   Lt. Col. Javier Carrion, deputy chief of the Sandinista army's
general staff, said the Sandinistas had pushed 1,800 rebels back
into Honduras. The Sandinista forces totaled 4,500 troops, he said.
   The Nicaraguan government had said 6,000 Contras have been
operating within its borders nationwide. Carrion said the offensive
caught the rebels ``totally by surprise.''
   Charles Barclay, press officer for the U.S. Embassy in
Tegucigalpa, said the deployment of American troops to Palmerola
air force base, about 50 miles northwest of Tegucigalpa, was
continuing today.
   Two battalions from the 82nd Airborne Division of Fort Bragg,
N.C., and two battalions from the 7th Light Infantry Division of
Fort Ord, Calif., were combined into a task force of roughly 3,000
troops.
   It was the the most dramatic show of U.S. force since the
Contras began fighting in Nicaragua and it came in response to a
request for help from President Jose Azcona Hoyo of Honduras.
   In Washington, the Defense Department said nine helicopter
gunships were flown in for the U.S. exercise.
   Palmerola air base is about 125 miles west of the area where
Reagan administration officials say the hostilities were taking
place.
   Maj. Gen. Carl W. Stiner, commander of the 82nd Airborne, said
he knew of no plan to have U.S. troops enter into fighting between
Sandinistas and Contras.

<TEXT>
   A Colt revolver that its owner claims was
stolen from the bullet-ridden body of legendary Mexican
revolutionary Francisco ``Pancho'' Villa goes on the auction block
this weekend.
   The true tale of the ivory-handled revolver is a mystery, and
only Villa would know for certain whether it is the gun he was
wearing on his left hip when assassins ambushed him in 1923.
   A New Mexico man who has owned the gun for 20 years says he's
certain it belonged to Villa, was stolen from his body by one of
his killers and possibly used to fire a final shot into Villa's
head.
   But Oscare Torres, assistant director of the cultural relations
branch of the Office of Foreign Relations in Mexico City, said
Mexican officials do not believe the revolver is authentic.
   Another who doubts the collector's story is Apolinar Frias,
chief guide for the Historical Museum of the Revolution in
Chihuahua, which houses Mexico's major Villa exhibits.
   On Saturday, bidders will decide. The owner said he believes the
gun will fetch more than $25,000.
   The gun is the centerpiece of a two-day Western memorabilia
auction at the Texas Ranger Museum that features hundreds of items,
ranging from old books and paintings to Indian artifacts.
   The single-action revolver has a symbol of Mexico _ an eagle
clasping a serpent in its beak _ engraved on its left grip.
   Villa, driving with several companions, was ambushed July 20,
1923, by eight gunmen in the state of Chihuahua, where the former
revolutionary general settled after ending his marauding military
career.

<TEXT>
   Negotiators trying to work out a settlement in the
Afghanistan war were reportedly under new pressure to reach an
agreement Friday after a statement released by the Soviet Foreign
Ministry.
   The talks recessed for the weekend, and U.N. officials said they
would resume Monday.
   An Afghan rebel leader said the Soviet Union was secretly trying
to contact the resistance to negotiate an agreement.
   In Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim P. Perfiliev said if
a settlement proved impossible in Geneva, Moscow's withdrawal of
its troops from Afghanistan ``will be performed differently'' from
terms agreed to this month.
   Those terms state that the 115,000 Red Army troops would be out
of Afghanistan in a nine-month span and that half would leave in
the first three months. The troops intervened in December 1979.
   A source close to the Geneva talks, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the statement was expected to add momentum to the
U.N.-mediated negotiations.
   A Pakistani source said the Soviet statement seemed designed to
pressure Pakistan into modifying its demand that a settlement be
linked to the formation of a new government in Afghanistan to
oversee a settlement.
   Pakistan represents the guerrillas in the talks.
   In Peshawar, Pakistan, Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, the new chairman of
the Afghan resistance, said the Soviets were trying secretly to
contact the insurgents.
   ``The Russians are willing to (talk) but secretly. They are
trying for it but secretly, not openly,'' Hekmatyar said.
   Hekmatyar also said that only an agreement with the resistance
would guarantee the Red Army's safe passage out of Afghanistan.
   The guerrillas do not recognize Kabul's Soviet-backed government
and have said the U.N. talks are useless because they don't
directly involve them and the Soviets.
   ``The Russians have to realize the fact that without an
agreement with the Mujahedeen it is not possible for the Afghan
crisis to be solved,'' said Hekmatyar.
   He said the guerrillas would stop fighting if the Soviet troops
withdraw unconditionally and abandon attempts to preserve the
communists' power.
   ``We will give them safe passage to leave Afghanistan ... if
they take the government they brought by their forces along with
them,'' Hekmatyar said. ``We will open the gates of Afghanistan for
them to leave.''
   If not, he said, the guerrillas will increase attacks on Soviet
bases and concentrate on their expected withdrawal route through
northern Afghanistan.

   Young Roman Catholics bent on
revenge for a bloody attack on an IRA funeral threw gasoline bombs
at the homes of Protestants, hijacked cars and attacked police into
the early hours today.
   Police fired plastic bullets to disperse the rioters. The
violence died out before dawn, but some Belfast roads remained
blocked today by burned out vehicles.
   Later today, several hundred mourners gathered at a Requiem Mass
for Thomas McErlean, 20. He was killed Wednesday at Milltown
cemetery when youths chased the Protestant attacker, who fled still
firing and throwing hand grenades. The crowd cornered and beat the
man, now in police custody.
   Meanwhile, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported that a banned
Protestant guerrilla group, the Ulster Freedom Fighters, claimed
reponsibility for killing another Catholic, Charles McGrillen, 25.
McGrillen, also buried today, was gunned down at a supermarket on
Tuesday.
   A press officer at Belfast police headquarters said local people
in West Belfast chased away Catholic youths after they threw
gasoline bombs at the homes of elderly Protestants.
   Ignoring pleas to stay calm, other young men set fire to
vehicles and threw gasoline bombs at security forces in sporadic
incidents. The violence affected Catholic areas of west and north
Belfast, parts of Londonderry, Northern Ireland's second largest
city, and Newry, a mainly Catholic town in the south of the
province.
   Nine policemen and one civilian were slightly hurt Thursday from
rock and bottle-throwing at a St. Patrick's Day parade in
Rasharkin, about 35 miles north of Belfast, and six people were
arrested. In Belfast, police said three people were arrested for
possessing gasoline bombs.
   Tension remained high following Wednesday's attack by a
Protestant gunman on the funeral of three IRA guerrillas. The
attack left three dead and 68 injured.
   The three guerrillas were shot and killed by British security
forces in Gibraltar March 6 as they allegedly prepared to plant a
car bomb. They were unarmed.
   A fourth IRA guerrilla, not involved in the Gibraltar case, was
buried Thursday without incident.
   The outlawed Irish Republican Army is fighting to end British
rule in Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland and unite the
province with the Irish Republic, which is predominantly Roman
Catholic.
   Police stayed at a distance from the funerals Wednesday and
Thursday following an assurance from Catholic churchmen that the
IRA would not stage armed paramilitary displays, which are illegal.
   Although the two men whose funerals were today were both
Catholic, neither was publicly linked to the IRA.
   The recent attacks prompted fears that Northern Ireland's
sectarian turmoil, which has lasted nearly two decades and claimed
about 2,500 lives, could escalate again.
   At a St. Patrick's Day rally, Gerry Adams, president of the
IRA's legal political wing, Sinn Fein, appealed to about 5,000
mainly young Catholics not to riot.
   ``Stay calm,'' Adams said as a British army helicopter hovered
overhead and black smoke rose in the distance from a burning
vehicle. ``Let's not add to the burdens people in this area and
other nationalist areas have to deal with.''
   Police are holding two men in connection with the attack.
Michael Stone, a Protestant, who allegedly threw grenades and fired
at the mourners, remained under armed guard in a Belfast hospital.
The second man has not been named.
   Northern Ireland's main Protestant paramilitary groups denied
involvement in the attack.

   A man who commanded a pit bull to attack
trees was ordered to perform 40 hours of community service work
planting or pruning trees.
   Gerald E. Huber Jr., 20, will also have to pay for the
replacement of any of the 13 damaged trees if they die, according
to the order Thursday in Lancaster County Court. Restitution could
be as high as $1,545.
   Huber pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of criminal
mischief. Police said on July 6 and July 8, Huber ``by verbal
commands and hand signals'' caused a 14-month-old dog named Davey
to attack the trees.
   ``Why would you do something like that?'' Judge Michael J.
Perezous asked.
   ``I don't know. I guess showing off,'' the defendant replied.
   Huber also was placed on probation for two years.
   Defense counsel Roy D. Shirk said that Huber told him he had
been drinking when he ordered the dog to attack the trees.

<HEAD>Talks Stalled Between Laos And Thailand On Border Agreement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VIENTIANE, Laos (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Disagreement over a 1907 border treaty
stalled talks Friday between Laos and Thailand to resolve a
frontier conflict that has claimed hundreds of lives.
   Thailand's ambassador to Laos, Niran Panupong, said both sides
have different interpretations of the treaty between his country
and what was then French-ruled Laos.
   In addition, Thongsi Intapon, a Laotian official of the Prime
Minister's Office, said Laos first wanted to define the role and
duties of a joint border committee proposed by the Thais before
such a body is formed.
   ``If we commit ourselves to that committee now, we will find
ourselves arguing in the jungles,'' Thongsi told reporters
accompanying the 15-member Thai delegation to the talks.
   The Thais want an agreement defining the location of the border
in the disputed wedge of hills between Thailand's northern
Phitsanulok province and Laos' Sayaboury province.
   Top Thai army officials have said 147 Thai soldiers and 402
Laotian troops died before the two sides began a truce and pledged
to enter into peace talks Feb. 19.
   The Thais say they will take the dispute to the World Court if a
bilateral agreement is not reached. But Thongsi said such a move
would be ``a last resort and not necessary.''
   He said the prime ministers of both countries want a speedy
agreement but added the talks could take ``quite a while'' if the
atmosphere at Friday's meeting persisted.
   The 1,030-mile border is poorly defined, and a similar
territorial dispute over three border villages led to battles in
1984.

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat led about 1,000
mourners after Friday in a funeral procession for his elder
brother, a Cairo businessman.
   Mustafa Arafat, 62, died of liver cancer Thursday at the
Palestinian Red Crescent Hospital in Cairo, which is run by Fat'hy
Arafat, another brother.
   Yasser Arafat, 57, flew to Cairo for the funeral from the
Palestine Liberation Organization headquarters in Tunisia.
Officials he met afterward with Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid
about Palestinian unrest in the Israeli-occupied territories and
efforts for MIddle East peace.
   Hundreds of uniformed police and plainclothes security men
guarded the mosque in suburban Nasr City and the 500-yard
procession route.
   The coffin, shoulder-carried by members of the Palestinian Red
Crescent Society in white and blue uniforms, was draped in the red,
black, white and green Palestinian flag. The Red Crescent is the
Moslem equivalent of the Red Cross Society.
   Yasser Arafat, wearing his customary khaki fatigues and black
and white checkered headdress, shook shook hands with mourners who
offered condolences outside the mosque. The funeral service
coincided with the weekly Moslem midday prayers.
   President Hosni Mubarak was in Sinai with Sheik Zayed bin Sultan
al-Nahyan, the visiting president of the United Arab Emirates, and
delegated former Prime Minister Aly Lutfy to represent him at the
funeral.
   Also among the mourners were Prime Minister Atef Sedki, other
Cabinet members and senior government officials, and leaders of
opposition parties.
   Mustafa Arafat was among the first to join his brother's Fatah
guerrilla group, the largest of eight factions in the PLO, nearly
25 years ago.
   The PLO chairman is known to have two living brothers _ Fat'hy,
the hospital director, and Gamal, who represents the PLO in North
Yemen _ and a sister in Cairo who is known by the code-name Um
al-Mumeneen, ``Mother of the Faithful.''

<TEXT>
   Police have charged the owner of two
dogs with criminally negligent homicide after the dogs chased a
bicyclist who fell and died.
   Candelario Guerrero, 45, was released from the Williamson County
Jail on Thursday after posting $1,500 bond on the misdemeanor
charge, which carries penalties of up to a year in jail and a
$2,000 fine.
   Donald Carlyle Westbrook, 41, of Austin, who rode his bicycle 30
to 40 miles each day, died from head injuries, according to police
Officer Bryan Leath.
   Westbrook was riding near Guerrero's business Tuesday when two
dogs started to chase him, according to the police report. As he
sped up to flee the dogs, Westbrook looked back, lost control of
his bicycle and flipped over the handlebars, the report said.
   He died Wednesday. His heart was transplanted into an Austin
woman Thursday morning, and one of his kidneys was transplanted
into another patient.
   The dogs, police said, were used to guard Guerrero's automotive
repair business. Guerrero was at the business when the dogs got out
through an open gate, Leath said.
   Guerrero could not be reached for comment Friday. The telephone
at his business was disconnected; there was no residential listing
for him in Round Rock.
   Police Chief Wesley Wolff said the dogs were confiscated and
will probably be destroyed. One is a 1-year-old Doberman; the
second is a 2-year-old chow mix, according to police.

   Here is a summary of the latest developments in the
Sandinista-Contra fighting along the Honduran-Nicaraguan border and
repercussions from the United States' deployment of troops in
Honduras:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>IN WASHINGTON:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The White House denied Nicaraguan charges that the United States
was behind a Honduran bombing raid on the Nicaraguan border. Reagan
administration spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: ``We haven't asked
them (the Hondurans) or instructed them to do anything. We have
offered our support and we have sent our forces there in defense of
that.''
   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci said Friday that 3,200 soldiers
being sent to Honduras were there only for ``moral support'' and
that they would be kept away from combat during their 10-day
training exercise.
   The Pentagon said 700 paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne
Division of Fort Bragg, N.C., dropped into Honduras on Friday from
eight aircraft, and the deployment would be completed by tonight.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>IN NICARAGUA:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Foreign Ministry blamed the United States for a Honduran
attack on Sandinista army targets and formally protested to
Washington. A spokesman said such cross-border air raids could lead
to war between the United States and Nicaragua.
   Sandinista officers said two bombs fell in Nicaragua and a third
landed across the narrow Coco River in Honduran territory on
Thursday afternoon. Reporters taken to the area by a Sandinista
official saw at least five bombs fall, but it was impossible to say
which side of the border they landed on.
   Newspapers called on Nicaraguans to maintain a combat alert in
case U.S. troops invaded from Honduras, where 3,200 American troops
are being deployed.
   Nicaragua requested an emergency meeting of the United Nations'
Security Council this afternoon to consider the situation.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>IN HONDURAS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A military official said Honduran troops were moving along the
rugged frontier Friday and warplanes were on standby to oust
Nicaraguan soldiers, a day after Honduran warplanes fired bombs and
rockets at Nicaraguan army targets along the border. Honduras said
its air force fired rockets only inside its own territory.
   The high-ranking military official said Honduran troops had
orders to expel the ``invading troops'' from Nicaragua. He said an
estimated 1,000 Sandinistas were reported Friday on the Honduran
side of border at San Andres de Bocay. The Nicaraguan side is the
site of Sandinista military headquarters in northern Nicaragua.

<HEAD>ELSEWHERE:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Scores of people were arrested Friday as demonstrators blocked
federal buildings in Boston and San Francisco and slowed rush-hour
traffic in Chicago's Loop in protests against the movement of
troops to Honduras. More than 100 people were arrested in San
Francisco, up to 60 in Chicago and one in Boston on the second day
of protests, police said.
   In Miami, Contra leaders said cease-fire talks scheduled Monday
with the government were off unless the Sandinistas left Honduras.

   Tricycle, unicycle, skateboard, sled and
bicycle riders beware: Without a driver's license, you could get a
ticket, and your vehicle could be seized.
   The ordinance intended to put the brakes on reckless riders has
let loose a storm of protest, and one woman moved so her
13-year-old son could ride his bicycle without fear of arrest.
   The regulation, passed unanimously by aldermen Feb. 15, requires
bicyclists to have a driver's license or be supervised by someone
who does. It also applies to riders of unicycles, tricycles,
all-terrain vehicles, skateboards, minibikes, wagons, sleds,
scooters and go-carts.
   Town officials said the law was desperately needed to curtail
reckless attitudes among bike riders, especially young ones, some
of whom played ``chicken'' with cars.
   Violation of the law is a misdemeanor.
   ``The children don't have any freedom,'' said Mable Lee, who
moved two weeks ago to an area northwest of town so her son, Tom,
could ride his bike again. ``What have they got to do? There's
nothing for 'em to do.''
   Mayor Will Cathey said something had to be done to protect both
drivers and bicyclists. He added that the ordinance was passed
after three advertised public hearings, which nobody attended.
   ``After the ox got gored, then they (protesters) came down,'' he
said. ``I've received a lot of support from my constituents over
the town taking action about these bicycles, a tremendous amount of
support.''
   Rosman, population 515, has no police force. The Transylvania
County sheriff's department confiscated three bikes shortly after
the law was passed but later released them, said Jim Stroup, chief
investigator for the department.
   He said the sheriff's office is waiting to hear from the state
attorney general's office about whether the law is constitutional
before it actively enforces the ordinance.
   Under the ordinance, youthful violators will be referred to
county youth counselor Pat Roach. ``This is something we will try
to settle without going to court,'' she said. ``That's true with
any kind of complaint about a child.''

   Gov. Evan Mecham, his honesty challenged
on the witness stand, shouted he's ``tired of this kind of
baloney,'' but acknowledged ordering Arizona's top lawman not to
cooperate in an investigation of an alleged death threat.
   The first-term Republican governor got into more than one
shouting match with prosecutor Paul Eckstein during his second day
of testimony at his impeachment trial Thursday, as Eckstein sought
to damage Mecham's credibility.
   Mecham is accused of trying to thwart an investigation of the
death threat allegedly made by one of his staffers against a top
aide who was scheduled to testify before a grand jury investigating
the governor's campaign finances.
   He returned to the stand today, and was expected to complete his
testimony on the accusation, the first of three major charges
against him. He also is accused of concealing a $350,000 campaign
loan and of misusing $80,000 from a state fund by loaning it to his
auto dealership.
   At least one other witness was expected to be recalled to the
stand _ state official Peggy Griffith, who reported the alleged
death threat Nov. 13. The last scheduled witness was Mecham's own
defense attorney, Fred Craft, who was present at a key meeting in
connection with the obstruction claim.
   Mecham, fighting for his political life, insisted Thursday he
was kept in the dark about the details of the death threat made by
a former state official, Lee Watkins. When he did hear about it, he
said he didn't consider it serious.
   ``Two somewhat excitable people had a verbal exchange and
somewhere along the line there were those who determined they would
make something out of it,'' he said. ``It's a total manufactured
thing.''
   Mecham acknowledged, however, that he ordered Ralph Milstead,
the state Department of Public Safety director, not to cooperate
with an attorney general's investigation of the alleged threat.
   ``I said, `Tell them we've looked into it and there's nothing to
it,''' he said.
   Mecham said today he wishes he had fired Milstead, and that if
he had, ``We wouldn't be sitting in this body in this action
today... I have highly repented of that.''
   During nearly three weeks of testimony, witnesses quoted Watkins
as saying that Mecham's former top aide, Donna Carlson, might ``go
on a long boat ride'' if she testified before the grand jury.
Watkins has denied the charge.
   It would require a two-thirds vote of the 30-member state Senate
to remove Mecham from office. They could then take another vote on
barring him from any future state office.
   In addition to the impeachment trial, the first of a U.S.
governor in six decades, Mecham faces a criminal trial April 21 on
felony charges that he concealed the $350,000 loan. He also faces a
recall election May 17.
   Attorney General Bob Corbin confirmed Thursday his office also
is looking into a $150,000 personal loan taken by Mecham in
December to pay off the unreported campaign loan.
   In a series of testy exchanges under cross-examination by
Eckstein Thursday, Mecham turned combative and at one point
declared, ``I am kind of tired of this kind of baloney!''
   During six hours on the stand, the governor pleaded a faulty
memory for details but said he knew one thing _ he had never been
accused of anything worse than a traffic ticket before the current
proceedings.
   Eckstein then produced copies of two lawsuits in which Mecham
was accused of fraud in business deals.
   The governor bristled, saying that was not the same thing, and
attempted a lengthy explanation that became a shouting match as the
attorney tried to stop him.
   ``This has to be told. You're trying to impugn my honesty!''
Mecham said.
   Eckstein interrupted, saying,``I'll ask the questions.''
   ``I'll respond as I see fit,'' snapped Mecham. ``I've earned the
right to respond!''
   At one point Mecham said, ``Hopefully, I will be back on the
ninth floor (the governor's office) in the near future,'' and as he
left the Senate building he flashed a thumbs-up sign to reporters
and well-wishers.

<HEAD>Tape Reveals Policeman Ordered to Rescue Rape Victim</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Tape-recorded police transmissions
indicate three officers who stood outside an apartment while a
12-year-old girl was raped didn't heed a supervisor's order to kick
in a door.
   The recording was played Thursday during a disciplinary hearing
for Officer James Horka. Horka is accused of waiting for the
building's landlord to arrive with a key instead of breaking down
the door to rescue the girl.
   The tape indicates Horka arrived outside the apartment at 4:39
a.m. on Dec. 20 and said over the radio two minutes later, ``We're
going to the back door; supposedly it's a home invasion.''
   The order to kick down the door came two minutes after Horka
told his superiors the girl's mother was ``worried for the welfare
of her 12-year-old daughter,'' according to the tape.
   Horka's supervisor, Sgt. Ernest Targonski, said, ``...you've got
to get in there somehow, so long as she states that the man is in
there. We've got to push the door in; push the door in.''
   But Horka and two other police officers waited almost a
half-hour before entering the home, the tape indicates.
   The girl was rescued when Officer Peter Miller arrived at the
scene and entered the apartment through an open back door.
   Hearings for officers Kevin Beasley and Daniel Surufka, who
arrived with Horka and were under his supervision, are to begin
March 28.
   Former Police Chief James Shutoski, who retired during the
controversy, recommended firing the three officers.
   Horka expressed confusion on the tape. He said of the mother,
``This girl is freaking out.'' When asked by the dispatcher whether
the incident was a rape, he replied, ``I don't know; I don't know
what this is right now.''
   Horka's attorney Thomas Tyrell says the tape proves Horka's
contention that he decided to wait for a key because he did not
know if the intruder had a weapon and would harm the girl or her
10-year-old brother if he heard police breaking in.
   Benjamin Valentine, 19, of Chicago, has been charged in the
assault.

<HEAD>Western Art Collection To Go To Autry Museum</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum in
Los Angeles has purchased an 87-piece Western art collection worth
an estimated $8.7 million.
   The collection, which had been on permanent loan to Joslyn Art
Museum since 1967, contains works by 37 artists, including Frederic
Remington, Charles M. Russell, Albert Bierstadt and George Catlin.
   The Autry museum obtained the collection by a sealed bid to the
Enron Art Foundation at Enron Corp. headquarters in Houston. An
Enron spokesman declined to disclose the price or number of
bidders. A statement by the Autry museum also did not give the
price.
   The collection, assembled from the Western art holdings of
Knoedler Galleries in New York City, was purchased for an
undisclosed sum in 1967 by the Northern Natural Gas Co., an Enron
Corp. predecessor.
   Last May, the Enron Art Foundation offered the collection, along
with a collection of 113 works by Alfred Jacob Miller for $10.8
million.
   Joslyn said it would buy the Miller collection for $4.4 million,
but decided not to buy the Western collection. The museum has
another Western collection, appraised at $14 million, that was
donated by the Enron Foundation in November 1986.
   ``Under the circumstances that the sale was inevitable, I am
pleased that the material is coming to a museum,'' Henry Flood
Robert, Joslyn's director, said Thursday. ``It means the material
will still be accessible to the public in the future.''
   The Autry museum, named after the cowboy movie actor who now
owns the California Angels baseball team, is being built by a
charitable trust set up through the estate of the late Ina Mae
Autry, Autry's wife.
   The museum is to open in October with 52,000 square feet of
exhibit space on 13 acres in Griffith Park. It has a collection of
12,000 items, including Autry's personal holdings.

<DATELINE>TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis holds a
slight edge in Kansas Democratic presidential caucuses on Saturday
based on an organization that even his rivals concede is strong.
   Dukakis, Jesse Jackson and Albert Gore Jr. all campaigned in
Kansas this week, trying to kindle enthusiasm among registered
Democrats and spur them to turn out at 117 caucuses. Kansas, with
only 39 national convention delegates, has been ignored until now.
   ``We've been organized in Kansas for eight months,'' said state
Sen. Paul Feleciano, Dukakis' state chairman. ``I feel very good
heading into the caucuses. I think we'll get 20 to 24 of the 39
delegates still to be picked.''
   State Sen. Joe Norvell, a Gore supporter, conceded Dukakis'
organizational lead in Kansas, but said, ``I do believe that, with
Sen. Gore's extensive campaign trip through the state, his efforts
could minimize what I would consider an early lead for Gov.
Dukakis.''
   Gore, lacking a big organization here, campaigned Wednesday and
Thursday throughout the state. The Tennessee senator won
endorsements from state Treasurer Joan Finney, the highest elected
Democratic state official, and a qualified endorsement from state
Chairman Jim Parrish.
   ``Were it not for my promise to the Democratic state committee
early on ... to stay neutral until the 19th of March, I'd be making
a public announcement for you,'' Parrish told Gore. ``I'm leaning
very much in your favor.''
   Jackson has had a better organizational effort in Kansas than
has Gore, but his supporters conceded recently they are not
organized in enough counties to garner a majority of the Kansas
delegates.
   Rep. Jim Slattery, who supports Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt,
said Friday his candidate would do well in Kansas, and he said
Michigan ``is a do-or-die state'' for Gephardt. Michigan's
Democratic caucuses will be held March 26.
   ``I always hate to make predictions that can be proven wrong in
48 hours, so I'll avoid doing that. I think they'll all get
delegates. Rep. Dick Gephardt and undecided will do well,''
Slattery said.
   Gore supporter Norvell also predicted a large uncommitted vote
Saturday, saying he thinks Kansas Democrats still are making up
their minds.
   ``I really do not see a front-runner in Kansas,'' he said.
   Democrats will caucus Saturday afternoon and vote for delegates
to the district conventions April 23 and the state convention May
14.

<HEAD>Illegal Aliens Driving Down Wages And Job Conditions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Illegal aliens are driving down wages and job
conditions for low-income native Americans and legal immigrants but
also are indirectly enhancing job opportunities for some
higher-skilled workers, congressional investigators say in a new
report.
   Hurt most by the tide of illegal workers sweeping border, farm
and some metropolitan areas are native and legally documented
immigrant crop pickers, janitors and food processing workers, the
General Accounting Office says.
   Wage and benefit increases won by largely legal Mexican migrants
and native black workers under union organizing campaigns in those
industries in the 1970s have disappeared as they have been
displaced by illegal immigrants working at often below-minimum
wages, the GAO said in a 70-page report.
   For example, janitors in downtown Los Angeles office buildings _
most of them black or legal Hispanic immigrants _ had won wage and
benefits reaching a peak of $12 an hour by 1983 under union
contracts, according to the report.
   However, a group of aggressive non-union janitorial services
hiring predominantly illegal immigrants have since wrested away the
best building contracts, driving the union scale back down to $4 an
hour and below.
   Of 2,500 black janitors working under high-wage contracts in
1977, only 100 still enjoyed comparative wages by 1985, the GAO
said. The union still had 600 working members but 500 of them had
suffered large pay cuts.
   Citrus and tomato pickers in southern California _ many of them
Mexicans admitted under guest worker programs _ have seen their
wages and benefits drop by 18 percent since 1975 because of the
growing use of illegal immigrants by farm labor contractors, the
GAO said.
   However, the congressional investigators said it is impossible
to measure what it called the ``net effects'' of the growing use of
illegal aliens in other businesses, such as full-service
restaurants and high-fashion shoe and garment manufacturing.
   The increased supply of illegal workers undoubtedly depressed
wages for some natives or legal immigrants in those industries,
too, the GAO said.
   ``But, at the same time, by stimulating business, (they) also
expanded employment opportunities and wages for other legal and
native workers in complementary, usually skilled occupations,'' it
said.
   As an example, it cited full-service restaurants that use
illegal aliens as dishwashers and busboys. The associated labor
savings allow low prices that lead to expanded sales, creating jobs
for more higher-skilled and higher-paid chefs and waiters, the GAO
said.
   Citing case studies in New York City and Los Angeles, the GAO
said illegal immigrants working at low wages by U.S. standards have
meant the survival of small, specialized companies in the
high-fashion women's footwear and garment industries.
   The studies quoted owners of those companies as saying they are
under intense cost pressure from foreign producers and could not
find Americans or legal immigrants willing to work all day behind
sewing machines or with the skills needed to produce high-fashion
women's shoes.
   Without a supply of illegal workers, the GAO concluded, many of
those businesses would close down or move their operations out of
the country.
   The Labor Department strongly disagreed with the GAO's
conclusions, saying none of the studies it surveyed offered any
concrete evidence of a positive effect from using illegal workers,
except the comments from employers.
   In a formal reply to the report, the department also disputed
GAO's premise that legal workers won't take many of the low-wage
jobs, particuarly in the shoe and garment industries.
   ``The fact is that large numbers of native and legal U.S.
workers are in the same labor market as illegal workers,'' the
Labor Department said. ``If wages were not depressed by illegal
workers, even greater numbers of native and legal workers would be
in that labor market.''
   The study was requested by Congress in 1985, when it was
considering immigration reform legislation enacted a year later
providing for government fines against employers who use illegal
aliens.
   If successful, the GAO said, those employer sanctions will force
wages up for legal immigrants and natives, causing ``considerable
stress'' financially for growers and some manufacturers.

<TEXT>
   Police on Friday threatened
strict action against organizers of a national strike set for
Monday, the anniversary of the 1960 Sharpeville massacre.
   Anti-apartheid organizations have called for a ``national day of
protest'' to mark the anniversary and to protest the recent
crackdown on major black opposition groups.
   The strike also had been intended to protest the scheduled
execution Friday of six blacks from Sharpeville convicted of
complicity in the 1984 mob killing of a black town councilor during
anti-apartheid riots.
   On Thursday, 15 hours before the hangings were to take place, a
judge granted a one-month stay of execution to the ``Sharpeville
Six.'' Instead of a mass execution, one black man convicted in a
separate murder case was hanged at Pretoria Central Prison at dawn
Friday without fanfare or an overnight vigil.
   Tsepo Letsoara, 24, was convicted of killing a black woman in
October 1985. There was no campaign to save him, and neither the
government nor its opponents has contended that his crime had
political overtones.
   Police commanders announced that reinforcements would be
deployed Monday in the Johannesburg area, where the strike is
expected to be most widespread.
   Calls for strikes are illegal under emergency regulations in
effect since June 1986. But on other ``days of protests'' since
then, hundreds of thousands of black workers and students have
stayed home.
   ``We are planning all actions humanly possible to prevent
persons from intimidating and preventing workers from being able to
do a good day's work,'' said Lt. Pierre Louw, a police spokesman.
   He said labor unions and other ``elements'' organizing the
strike were under investigation.
   March 21 is observed annually by blacks as ``Sharpeville Day''
to mark the day in 1960 when 69 blacks were shot and killed by
police in the township south of Johannesburg while demonstrating
against the pass laws. The laws restricting blacks' freedom of
movement have since been repealed.
   Anti-apartheid riots broke out in Sharpeville and nearby
townships in September 1984, starting a two-year period of
nationwide unrest in which more than 2,000 blacks were killed. The
councilor whose murder led to the ``Sharpeville Six'' trial was
killed on the first day of those riots.
   The five black men and one woman gained their reprieve when
Pretoria Supreme Court Justice Willem Human granted a one-month
stay of execution after receiving evidence of perjury by a
prosecution witness.
   The government said it ignored a massive international appeal
for clemency, leaving the case in the hands of the judge.
   Attorney Prakash Diar said Friday the defense team had already
begun preparing an application to reopen the trial and re-examine
government witnesses.
   The six were convicted under the principle of ``common cause,''
which held them responsible for the September 1984 death of town
councilor Jacob Dlamini because they were part of a crowd of 100
who stoned and burned him to death in Sharpeville.
   President P.W. Botha had rejected pleas from leaders of most
Western nations and from countries and organizations around the
world to grant clemency. The government said Human's decision
``proves the wisdom of the state president and his ministers in
deciding not to intervene in the due process of law.''
   Two Johannesburg newspapers reported Friday that Botha had
granted clemency three weeks ago to a black policeman who had been
sentenced to death for 1986 murder of a youth in Mamelodi, a black
township outside Pretoria.
   A spokesman for Justice Department said Botha had commuted
Constable George John Sindane's death sentence to eight years in
prison, and he was one of five people whose death sentences were
commuted this year.

<HEAD>Soviet Shuttle To Be Launched By June in Unmanned Test</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet scientists are working around the clock to
prepare the first launch of their space shuttle on an unmanned test
flight expected by June, officials said Friday.
   Alexander I. Dunayev, the head of the space agency Glavkosmos,
also said that the agency plans to use the actual shuttle, not a
dummy, in the test flight and that more than one of the craft will
be built.
   Dunayev's comments at a news conference were the most detailed
to date about the Soviet shuttle. The session was called to discuss
Thursday's launch of an Indian satellite by a Soviet rocket.
   The Soviets are believed to have been developing their own
winged reusable spacecraft since at least 1982, but Soviet
officials did not confirm the project until December 1984 and have
released little information about it.
   Dunayev said the first flight of the shuttle was imminent.
   ``We are now working quite energetically on testing on land, on
the surface, of the components. We are working literally round the
clock,'' he said.
   He refused to specify when the launch will occur, saying only
that it would be ``in the nearest future.''
   ``It is very important that this flight be very thoroughly
prepared so I would not get involved in some guesswork,'' Dunayev
said.
   However, another Soviet space official, speaking privately, said
the first flight would occur in the first half of this year.
Neither he nor Dunayev would comment on when the first manned
flight would occur.
   Dunayev said Soviet scientists were encountering difficulties
daily in preparing the shuttle, but he did not provide details.
   Western specialists on the Soviet space program have said the
flight would be unmanned and computerized. Dunayev confirmed the
flight would be totally automated because the Soviet Union believes
pilotless tests are prudent.
   ``With the development of manned spacecraft, the Soviet Union
prefers at the first stage automats,'' he said. ``And we believe
that for the sake of security of human life what is required above
all is to ensure that man survives.''
   He went on to imply that U.S. space officials were not as
concerned about astronauts' safety as the Soviets were. Seven
astronauts were killed when the space shuttle Challenger exploded
in January 1986.
   ``We pursue the fundamental objective: whether man is alive or
dead after the flight. On the basis of that we regard the
fundamental differences between the Soviet direction of development
and the U.S. part of development,'' Dunayev said.
   James Oberg, an American specialist on the Soviet space program,
said in a telephone interview from his home in Texas that the
Soviet shuttle may include a separable nose section from which the
crew could escape in an emergency.
   Soviet officials have said little about the size or other
characteristics of the shuttle. But the Soviet press has reported
the shuttle will be lifted into orbit by the new Energia rocket
booster, which can carry up to 100 tons of payload, more than the
U.S. shuttle.
   In its first test May 15, Energia successfully carried aloft a
payload, but the payload's own engines failed.
   Alexei F. Bogomolov, director of the Soviet mission control
center near Moscow called Medvezhyi Ozero, said in an interview the
shuttle will have on-board engines to orient the craft in space and
maneuver it through the atmosphere toward a runway landing. The
U.S. shuttle glides powerless to landings.
   The Soviet space chief said the Soviet Union plans a fleet of
shuttles.
   ``How many, it's difficult to say. It is clear that we will have
more than one,'' he said.

<HEAD>Report: Trump Buying Plaza Hotel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Developer Donald Trump has a handshake agreement
to buy the landmark Plaza Hotel for $450 million, The Wall Street
Journal reported Friday.
   The Plaza's owners have agreed on basic terms with Trump and are
expected to sign a binding contract next week, according to sources
quoted in newspaper.
   A spokeswoman for Trump and a spokesman at Howard Rubenstein
Associates, which represents Trump, did not return telephone calls
seeking confirmation Friday.
   Another unidentified source quoted by the Journal said Trump was
the preferred bidder because it was believed he was most likely to
restore the hotel's luster.
   The 81-year-old landmark hotel was acquired in January from the
Allegis Corp. when Robert M. Bass of Fort Worth, Texas, and the
Tokyo-based Aoki Corp. bought the Westin Hotels and Resorts chain,
an Allegis subsidiary, for $1.53 billion. Bass owns 71 percent of
the Plaza; Aoki owns the rest. The Journal said a Bass spokesman
declined comment.
   The hotel, which overlooks Central Park at Fifth Avenue, can be
seen from Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, which combines restaurants,
shops and apartments.
   The Plaza is expected to earn $22 million this year, which
industry professionals quoted by the Journal said is a meager
return for the price Trump is offering.
   ``I think anything over $350 million is high,'' Stephen Brenner,
a New York hotel consultant, said.
   In 1907, the Plaza opened as a permanent residency hotel and
later became a commercial hotel. A few tenants from before World
War II are protected by rent control laws and pay $200 a month in
rent.

<HEAD>Police: Two Accused of Having Sex on Flight; Two Threw Food</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout with couple denying charges.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple accused of having sex on a transatlantic
flight were charged with public indecency, and two men who began
throwing food when a flight attendant intervened also have been
charged, police said.
   But the couple, a doctor and his wife, a lawyer and part-time
judge, say they were sleeping on American Airlines Flight 37 from
Munich, West Germany, to San Diego, and did nothing wrong.
   The four were arrested Monday when the jet made an intermediate
stop in Chicago, according to police reports.
   But Phillip Matin, who was arrested with his wife, Sharyn Jo Van
Tassell, denied the charges. ``This was the fantasy of a young girl
that is completely uncorroborated,'' he told the Sacramento
(Calif.) Bee. ``It's ridiculous.''
   Police said most passengers apparently were asleep Monday during
the eight-hour Atlantic crossing when a 13-year-old girl told her
mother she believed the couple across the aisle was engaged in a
sex act. The mother called an attendant, who notified a supervisor,
said Sgt. Jerry Thornton.
   The supervisor, Barbara Weiderman, told the captain of the
problem, and he radioed police to be on standby at O'Hare. At that
point, two other passengers ``became abusive and belligerent'' and
began throwing food and drinks at the flight attendants, according
to the police report.
   When the plane landed, police arrested Van Tassell, 42, and
Matin, 52, of Loomis, Calif. Both were charged with public
indecency; Matin was also charged with possession of a controlled
substance after authorities found eight yellow pills in one of his
bags.
   Matin said they were Valium and he couldn't prove they were
prescription drugs because the bottle they came from was in his
luggage.
   Roger F. Cline, 42, of Placerville, Calif., and Stanley Wells,
53, of Cameron Park, Calif., were charged with disorderly conduct
in connection with the food fight.
   All four missed the continuation of their flight to San Diego,
but paid the bonds set on their misdemeanor charges and were
released pending April court appearances, police said.

<TEXT>
   A government commission has declared
Poland's first sex education book unacceptable and banned it from
schools, ending a six-month debate that made the text a best-seller
on the black market.
   ``Preparation for Life in the Family'' was introduced in high
schools last fall to a storm of protest.
   One normally pro-government lay Catholic newspaper called it ``a
textbook for masturbation and defloration.'' Another called it a
``sex manual for beginners.''
   Critics said it violated religious teachings and encouraged
pre-marital sex.
   After two months of complaints, Minister of National Education
Henryk Bednarski in November suspended the book's use in high
schools.
   On Friday, official newspapers announced that a special
commission appointed by Bednarski to evaluate the book now had
banned it permanently.
   The controversy didn't hurt the text's popularity. The first
printing of 500,000 copies sold out in state book stores and is
available only at inflated prices on the black market, according to
newspaper reports.
   The book was designed for use in a nationwide high school course
on family life and sexual matters, which had been taught since 1973
without a text.
   Many parents and clergy lined up against the book, but it was
defended by such odd political bedfellows as writers for Communist
Party papers and the underground publications of the banned
Solidarity trade union federation.
   The commission reviewing the book, including teachers,
psychologists, doctors and other experts, held its final meeting
Thursday.
   According to the official PAP news agency, the commission
chairwoman concluded, ``We appreciate the necessity of giving youth
sexual knowledge ... But we think that the book as a mandatory
textbook is unacceptable.''
   The chairwoman Anna Przeclawska, dean of Warsaw University's
pedagogics department, said experts found the book replete with
mistakes about biological and psychological topics and filled with
overly difficult language and ``inappropriate'' graphics.
   It presented a ``one-sided biological conception'' of sexual
problems, omitting the need for friendship and love, she said.
   A Roman Catholic Church weekly, Niedziela, said explicit
illustrations of sexual positions could lead to the ``arousal of
children'' and undermine parental authority.
   The commission recommended that work proceed slowly on a new
textbook, stressing that what is ``most important is the teacher
who cannot be replaced by anything.''
   A commentator on the popular youth-oriented television news
broadcast, Teleexpress, condemned the book ban and said young
people will be ``doomed to barnyard knowledge or often unqualified
teachers.''
   The book's defenders argued that it presented the Roman Catholic
view of opposing artificial contraception and abortions.
   They included the Polish United Workers Party weekly Polityka,
which published letters from readers who complained that Poland is
sexually backward.
   One reader said there were cases in which sales clerks
deliberately punched holes in condoms ``because this is the kind of
`morality' we have in Poland.''
   Daniel Passent, a Polityka columnist, accused the Roman Catholic
majority of attempting to force its views on the non-Catholic
minority.
   Several writers in clandestine weeklies published by Solidarity
also objected to the campaign against the book, which in turn
prompted outraged responses from pro-union priests and activists.
   A commentary in November in the most widely circulated
Solidarity underground weekly, Tygodnik Mazowsze, said sexual
knowledge among young Poles was ``close to medieval.''
   The book's backers argued the textbook was needed because many
youths lack information about sex and birth control.
   Estimates of the number of abortions per year range as high as
800,000. According to official statistics, every sixth woman who
gets married under the age of 20 is already pregnant.

   A baby with a fatal birth defect who
was maintained on a respirator for a week to preserve his organs
for transplant clung to life Friday without life support, officials
said.
   The boy, born with most of his brain and skull missing, was
taken off the respirator Thursday at Loma Linda University Medical
Center after he failed to show signs of brain death the hospital
requires before taking organs for transplant.
   ``Baby D continues to breathe on his own, and is being kept
comfortable,'' said spokeswoman Anita Rockwell.
   Meanwhile, another infant with the same condition being kept
alive in the Loma Linda organ donor program, began to show signs of
impending brain death Friday.
   Babies with the defect called anencephaly usually die within
hours or days of being taken off life-support systems, Ms. Rockwell
said.
   Loma Linda developed the first medical guidelines in the United
States for using life-support equipment to preserve anencephalics'
hearts and other organs for transplant. If the babies are allowed
to die naturally, their organs deteriorate to the point of being
unsuitable for transplant.
   The girl is the fifth anencephalic infant delivered into Loma
Linda's donor program. The first was stillborn, and the second met
criteria for brain death, but a suitable recipient for his organs
couldn't be found before the body parts deteriorated.
   The other two never met the hospital's criteria.
   Under the guidelines, infants are placed on life-support systems
for seven days. If doctors determine an infant is brain dead within
that time, the hospital will alert organ procurement agencies
nationwide and a search for a suitable recipient will begin.
   The hospital's criteria for brain death require that an infant
be in a coma and unable to breathe on his or her own and show an
absence of eye reflexes, Ms. Rockwell said.
   The life-support system helps prevent the infant's heart, liver
and other vital organs from deteriorating until doctors have
determined the baby is brain dead.
   The hospital's procedure was devised to address ethical
questions surrounding the use of doomed anencephalics as organ
donors.
   If an infant is not declared brain dead within seven days, he or
she is taken off the respirator and allowed to die naturally
without further consideration as a donor.

   Record low precipitation in parts of the West
last month has further reduced an already low water supply, the
Agriculture Department said Friday.
   ``We were hoping that precipitation levels would increase in
February and help ease the drought in sections of California,
Nevada, Montana, Idaho, Oregon, Washington and Wyoming,'' said
Wilson Scaling, chief of the department's Soil Conservation
Service. ``Instead, the situation has worsened.''
   The western water outlook is based on surveys by SCS and the
Commerce Department's National Weather Service. Western states
depend on snowmelt for about 75 percent of their water.
   Scaling said some areas are not affected by the dry conditions,
including ``very good'' prospects in Arizona, New Mexico and the
lower part of Colorado.
   ``These areas have had three wet winters in a row,'' he said.
``The soils are wet and there has been excellent carryover from
previous years.''

   A golfer who failed to qualify for a
tournament after interrupting her play to save a drowning child
will be allowed to enter the tournament through an unprecendented
exemption, the LPGA announced today.
   Commissioner John D. Laupheimer called Mary Bea Porter's revival
of the stricken child a once-in-a-decade occurence that warrants
such an exception to the ladies pro golfing rules.
   Mary Bea Porter, 38, had returned to the Phoenix golf course
after the rescue earlier this week but finished three strokes short
of qualifying for the Standard Register Turquoise Classic
tournament next week in Phoenix.
   She had not been told of Laupheimer's decision when he made the
announcement today during the LPGA Tucson Open that began play
Thursday, when Ms. Porter shot a 79 in comparison with the
9-under-par 63 fired by the first-round leader, British rookie
Laura Davies.
   Players had petitioned Laupheimer to let Ms. Porter to play
despite having failed to qualify. Laupheimer said he took their
sentiments into account but had decided to find some way to
recognize her ``exemplary heroism.''
   Laupheimer said he knew of no other instance in which a golfer
who failed in a qualifying round had been allowed to play in an
LPGA tournament. He said he was concerned about setting a precedent
in modifying the rules, but added, ``I can't think of anything else
in golf that has captured the hearts of not only the golfing
community but the public at large.''
   The petition originated with Bonnie Lauer, president of the LPGA
Player Council.
   Ms. Porter was lining up her shot on the 13th fairway Wednesday
when she saw 3-year-old Jonathon Smucker face down in a swimming
pool in a yard bordering the Moon Valley Country Club golf course
in Phoenix.
   She jumped the fence to help the boy's father, who had pulled
the boy out, and gave mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. A spokesman for
the Phoenix Fire Department said she saved the boy's life.
   ``I knew I had to do something ... so I threw him on the ground,
reached in and cleaned out his mouth, moved his tongue to the side
and blew,'' she said.
   The boy was crying in her arms when paramedics arrived, Ms.
Porter said.
   Ms. Porter has won $50,000 in 15 years on the ladies pro golf
tour.

   Very low blood cholesterol increases the
risk of one form of stroke, even though it decreases the overall
risk of all forms of stroke, researchers said Friday.
   A six-year study of 350,000 men showed that those with
cholesterol levels below 160 were three times as likely as others
to have a so-called hemorrhagic stroke, in which a blood vessel
bursts and the subsequent bleeding damages parts of the brain.
   The study's principal author, Dr. Hiroyasu Iso of the University
of Minnesota and the University of Tsukuba in Tsukuba City, Japan,
said his findings do not suggest any change in public health
efforts to get Americans to lower their blood cholesterol levels.
   ``Public efforts to lower cholesterol should continue, and our
efforts to understand the etiology (cause) of stroke should
increase,'' Iso said in presenting his results at a meeting of the
American Heart Association.
   Hemorrhagic strokes are less common than strokes caused by
clots, which account for 70 percent to 80 percent of all strokes.
   The increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke was observed only in
men with high blood pressure, but there might be a smaller increase
in risk in people with normal blood pressure, Iso said. His study
couldn't determine that, he said.
   The increased risk occurred in men with blood cholesterol levels
below 160 milligrams. Only 6 percent of the men he studies had
cholesterol levels that low, he said. The mean blood cholesterol
level in the subjects was 211 milligrams.
   Cholesterol levels below 200 milligrams are associated with a
low level of coronary heart disease.
   Levels over 240 milligrams double the risk. Twenty percent to 25
percent of Americans have cholesterol levels in this range,
according to the heart association.
   In Japan, low levels of cholesterol are more common, and
hemorrhagic strokes are more common, too, Iso said.
   Dr. William Kannel of the Framingham Heart Study in
Massachusetts said that study shows a similar risk associated with
low cholesterol, as does the Honolulu Heart Study directed by Dr.
Dwayne Reed of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.
   Those researchers and others said, however, that the risk
associated with very low cholesterol is outweighed by the benefits.
   ``Nothing confers immortality,'' said Kannel. ``You're always
dealing with tradeoffs.'' He emphasized that coronary heart
disease, with its strong link to elevated cholesterol, is the chief
form of heart disease. ``Given that, I'd say get your cholesterol
as low as you can,'' he said.
   ``If you look at total stroke,'' said Dr. Lewis Kuller of the
University of Pittsburgh, ``there's no question _ the lower the
cholesterol, the better.''

<HEAD>Gorbachev Says Soviet Can Learn From Yugoslavia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DUBROVNIK, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union announced Friday
it will borrow political and economic reforms from Yugoslavia and
reiterated that it won't impose its policies on other communist
nations.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev pledged as he ended a trip to
Yugoslavia that Eastern European countries are free to follow ``any
paths to socialism'' without Soviet interference.
   This echoed speeches Gorbachev made twice last year but it
marked the first time he put such a pledge into a formal document.
   The declaration, also signed by Yugoslav President Lazar Mojsov,
brings the Soviet Union one step closer to abandoning, at least on
paper, the so-called Brezhnev Doctrine that tolerates no
alternative to Moscow's brand of communism.
   Gorbachev returned to Moscow on Friday after a five-day visit to
Yugoslavia that gave him a first-hand look at the country's
decentralized economy and at its ethnic divisions similar to those
the Kremlin confronts at home.
   The trip, one of his longest to a foreign country, included
detailed talks with communist leaders, factory visits in Belgrade
and a stroll Friday through the medieval buildings and sun-drenched
narrow streets of Dubrovnik.
   ``Proceeding from the conviction that no one has a monopoly over
the truth, the two sides declare that they have no pretensions of
imposing their concept of social development on anyone,'' the
declaration said.
   For the first time, too, the Soviet Union embraced the concept
of socialist self-management that had been developed by Yugoslav
leader Josip Broz Tito after he broke with Moscow in 1948.
   ``The two sides consider the development of socialist
self-management, in keeping with the specificities of each country,
to be of the highest importance,'' the declaration said.
   ``It ensures the genuine authority of the people and the freedom
of the individual and is a dependable guarantee against any
administrative-bureaucratic distortion of socialism,'' the
declaration said.
   Friday's document replaces agreements reached by both countries
in 1955 and 1956, when then Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev
signaled that the Kremlin might tolerate alternative ways to
communism.
   But in 1956 workers unrests were crushed in Poland and Soviet
tanks quashed revolt in Budapest.
   Soviet historians have hinted in past months that Moscow may be
willing to review its assessment of Czechoslovakia's attempt in
1968 to develop an alternative brand of communism.
   However, the present Prague communist leadership took power
after the reforms were crushed by a Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion.
   Therefore any reassessment of ``Prague Spring'' would have to be
sensitive to those currently in power.
   Friday's declaration indicates Moscow wants to borrow some
economic and political practices from Yugoslavia, whose position
between East and West has enhanced its international standing and
standard of living over the past four decades.
   Meat, dairy and fresh produce, often in short supply for
Soviets, are readily available to Yugoslavs who also have access to
Western luxury items, like the Sony Walkman which are still a
coveted prize for most Soviets.
   But triple-digit inflation has cut Yugoslavs' standard of living
by at least a third since 1980, placing many consumer items out of
reach of workers earning an average wage of $180 a month.
   A $20 billion debt has built up, and many Yugoslavs expect times
to get even harder after the International Monetary Fund completes
negotiations this spring on how to reschedule debt payments.
   Gorbachev indicated Tuesday he also would not favor too much
decentralization of his economy, telling workers at the Belgrade
factory that ``we have to maintain a regulatory role in order not
to make mistakes.''
   Friday's document said the Soviets and Yugoslavs will work to
develop political and personal contacts.

   The Reagan administration is assured that
nuclear warheads will not be placed on Chinese intermediate-range
missiles sold to Saudi Arabia, but the sale is still a ``disturbing
regional trend,'' the State Department said Friday.
   The department confirmed that Saudi Arabia had acquired Chinese
missiles with a range of 2,200 miles _ capable of hitting all areas
of the Middle East, including Israel.
   With Iran and Iraq engaged in a so-called ``war of the cities''
_ the lobbing of missiles against major population centers _ the
introduction of more rockets into the region has raised concerns in
Washington, spokesmen said.
   ``It is another part of a disturbing regional trend in
surface-to-surface missile proliferation,'' said Rudolph Boone, a
State Department press officer. ``The sum total of the
proliferation is a degradation of the security of all states in the
region.''
   The missiles were described as Chinese CSS-2 rockets, similar to
those used in China's limited space program in the early 1970s and
capable of being outfitted with nuclear warheads.
   ``Such a system is not in the interests of peace and stability
in the region,'' Boone said.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz expressed U.S. concern about
the sales when he talked last week with Chinese Foreign Minister Wu
Xueqian, spokesman Charles E. Redman said.
   Wu and other Chinese officials since then have told the United
States ``categorically that it will not export nuclear weapons to
any government. We accept these assurances,'' Redman said.
   Saudi Arabia as well ``has assured us at the very highest level
that Saudi Arabia does not have nor does it intend to acquire any
nuclear capability,'' Redman said.
   He said the United States was in close touch with Saudi Arabia
on the issue, as well as with other governments in the region,
presumably Israel.
   The United States and six other major industrialized democracies
have agreed not to export ballistic and cruise missiles capable of
carrying payloads of 1,100 pounds more than 187 miles.
   ``We've been actively engaged in an effort to get other
countries to join that regime,'' Redman said. ``All nations were
invited to join. In the case of the Chinese we have approached them
specifically on several occasions about discussing it, but we
really haven't had any response to that invitation.''
   According to other officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, Saudi Arabia sought the Chinese missiles after the U.S.
Congress blocked the sale of 48 F-15 jet fighters to the Saudis.
Congress agreed late last year to permit the sale of 24 F-15s _
enough to keep Saudi air strength at current levels.
   The administration has said Saudi Arabia needs sophisticated
weapons for defense against a possible widening of the 7-year-old
Iran-Iraq war.

   Nearly 300 people demonstrating against sending U.S. troops to
Honduras were arrested today after blocking federal buildings in
Chicago, Boston and in San Francisco, where baton-wielding police
officers waded into the crowd.
   More than 200 people were arrested in San Francisco, up to 60 in
Chicago and one in Boston on the second day of protests, police
said. Twelve men and 12 women were arrested for blocking traffic in
front of the White House.
   About 50 protesters were arrested in the three cities Thursday,
the day 3,200 troops were sent to Honduras in what the White House
called a ``measured response'' to Nicaraguan troops crossing the
border into Honduras.
   Four hundred protesters marched today in Chicago, chanting,
``Reagan sent the troops today, get them out is what we say.'' Five
hundred blocked entry to the Federal Building in San Francisco and
80 stopped traffic at a military recruiting office near the John F.
Kennedy Federal Building in Boston.
   The Chicago arrests, on misdemeanor disorderly conduct charges,
came after demonstrators pasted 8{-by-11-inch orange stickers on
first-floor windows at the Loop federal building and sat in
intersections, police said.
   Many of the stickers bore skull and crossbones, and the message
``Stop U.S. intervention in Central America.''
   More than 1,000 people marched Thursday night from the Honduras
Consulate to the Federal Building in San Francisco. In Minneapolis,
protesters burned the U.S. flag. A mock ``Central America War
Memorial'' was erected in Philadelphia.
   At Fort Ord, Calif., home of the 7th Light Infantry, wives of
some of the 1,200 shipped-out soldiers joined protesters at the
gates Thursday.
   ``Bring the troops home. No Contra aid, no war,'' the Boston
protesters chanted today as they marched. One person was arrested.
   ``We want to non-violently protest President Reagan's decision
to send combat troops to Central America,'' said the Rev. Michael
Curry of Cliftondale United Methodist Church in Sagus, a protest
organizer. Curry said the marchers were affiliated with the
ecumenical Pledge of Resistance group.
   ``I believe our actions in Central America are wrong,'' said
Lenore Azaroff, 22, of Somerville. ``I believe sending troops to
Honduras is the first step to another Vietnam.''
   More than 200 people were arrested today in San Francisco as
they blocked traffic and the entrance to the Federal Building.
Helmeted police at one point blocked a street, rerouting rush-hour
traffic. Protesters stalled three cars in streets near the
building, forcing police to push them to the side.
   At least half a dozen violent confrontations erupted when
demonstrators tried to grab police equipment, including batons.
Officers lashed back, jamming the batons in the demonstrators'
stomachs and chests.
   The arrested demonstrators were handcuffed with plastic ties,
photographed and booked on the street, then taken in police vans to
the Hall of Justice.
   Police said the demonstrators arrested today would be cited and
released by federal authorities, just as 25 protesters were
Thursday.
   ``I'm outraged by the administation's sending troops to
Honduras. This is to cover-up all of Reagan's mistakes. It's also a
cover-up to divert our attention from the indictments,'' said
businessman Peter Holbrook.
   Four key figures in the Iran-Contra scandal were indicted
Wednesday, the day the White House annouced the troop movements.
   In Washington, D.C., 150 to 200 people demonstrated in front of
the White House today, said police Officer Tom Randolph. Twelve men
and 12 women were arrested after the protest spilled into
Pennsylvania Avenue. They were to have been fined $50 for blocking
traffic, but that was cut to $25 for disorderly conduct because
they didn't use a vehicle, Randolph said.
   Hundreds of sign-carrying demonstrators marched through Beverly
Hills, Calif., Thursday shouting ``Hands Off'' and ``No War in
Central America.'' No one was arrested, although police cited two
motorists for excessive honking.
   Authorities in Phoenix, Ariz., arrested 24 people for
trespassing when they blocked the entrance to the downtown federal
building with a 30-foot-long homemade sign reading ``U.S. troops
out of Honduras.''
   In Minneapolis, 400 people wearing everything from business
suits to studded leather jackets dragged newspaper racks and
benches into a busy street, bringing traffic to a halt during the
afternoon rush hour.
   The protesters burned a U.S. flag and chanted slogans as they
crowded the streets. No injuries were reported.
   In Boston, 200 people marched in a circle and chanted ``U.S.
troops out of Honduras'' outside the John F. Kennedy Federal
Building. Police said six people remained inside after closing but
were evicted without incident.
   U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., joined about 200 people who
gathered outside the federal courthouse building in Eugene to
denounce the action by the Reagan administration.
   Protesters in Philadelphia erected a 30-foot ``Central America
War Memorial'' that mimicked the Vietnam Memorial in the nation's
capital. It bore the names of Central Americans killed in the
region's civil wars. About 200 people marched in front of the
federal courthouse.
   In Fargo, N.D., on Thursday, 60 people chanted, sang and carried
signs outside the post office to protest.
   At Fort Ord, a the base 90 miles south of San Francisco, the
demonstrators included a pregnant Renee Worthing, 21, wife of
soldier James Worthing. She carried a sign that said, ``Stop The
Lies.''
   ``I think the whole thing has just been a lie,'' she said.
``Every time a presidential election comes up, a crisis comes up
and the president runs to the rescue. The community is not going to
stand for this.''

<TEXT>
   Once the home of Viking chiefs and
storyteller Hans Christian Andersen, the city of Odense celebrated
its 1,000th birthday Friday with hopes of recapturing the grandeur
of its past.
   This city in central Denmark was once a cultural center and
industrial power, but it fell on hard economic times. Local
officials have planned year-long millenium festivities to help
generate new business.
   Queen Margrethe II marked the city's anniversary by attending a
day of music and pageantry under clear skies. Fireworks and a
torchlight procession were scheduled for the evening.
   Cultural and sporting events, such as the junior cycling world
championships, ballet, theater and a huge laser-based
sound-and-light show, were planned for later in the year.
   Odense is at the geographic center of Denmark, on the island of
Funen. It takes its birth date from the first written reference to
the city ever found _ a letter from German Emperor Otto III
granting the church in Odense tax relief. It was dated March 18,
988.
   The city's symbol is a swan, from Andersen's fairy tale of the
ugly duckling, because Odense developed from a poor, backward
farming town to an industrial powerhouse.
   But Odense's shipbuilding, iron and wood industries eventually
became outdated, and unemployment climbed.
   In recent years, much of Odense's income has come from tourists
visiting the yellow cottage where Andersen, the son of a shoemaker
and a washerwoman, was born in 1805.
   About 200,000 people every year visit the home of Denmark's most
famous author, who wrote ``The Princess and the Pea,'' ``The
Emperor's New Clothes'' and other tales.
   Parts of Odense are the same as in Andersen's days, with winding
cobblestoned streets lined with 18th-century houses. But today the
charm of the inner city is surrounded by high-rise buildings and
urban malls.
   With 173,000 residents, Odense is Denmark's third largest city.
About 100 years ago it was the biggest in the country. Today it is
dominated by small companies, 97 percent of which employ fewer than
50 people.
   ``We have one of the country's highest unemployment rates,
almost 11 percent and growing,'' said Bjarne Christensen, the city
manager. The average jobless rate in Denmark is 8 percent.
   Christensen said he believed the millenium could mark a turning
point.
   ``The goal is to market Odense nationally and internationally,
to support the culture and to create a festive atmosphere,'' he
said. ``Of course we also aim at attracting people and business.''
   An 11-mile tunnel-bridge link between Funen and the main island
of Zealand is to be opened in 1993, giving Odense greater chances
to bid for conferences.
   ``We hope to become Denmark's center. With the Great Belt
bridge, you can get here from Copenhagen in an hour and 15
minutes,'' Mayor Verner Dahlsgaard said in an interview.
   Denmark's second TV channel, opening later this year, will be
based in Odense.
   The name Odense is from ``Odins Vi,'' meaning the shrine of Odin
who was chief of the Nordic gods and patron of culture and
language. The city prides itself on its museums, three of them
under the roof of a converted 19th-century cloth factory.
   North of Odense at Ladby, archaeologists discovered the remains
of a 72-foot ship which was put into the 1,000-year-old grave of a
Viking chief, along with his 11 horses.
   Christianity came to Odense in the 9th century. The medevial
cathedral built in 1300 contains the tomb of St. Knud, a king who
was murdered by his subjects for imposing high taxes.

   Rhythm-and-blues musician Ike
Turner, ex-husband of pop star Tina Turner, was convicted Friday on
two felony cocaine charges, but was cleared of possessing the drug
for sale.
   Turner, 55, of Los Angeles, was stopped in August by officers
who said he was driving erratically. He was arrested when they
found 5.6 grams of rock cocaine in his car.
   Jurors deliberated four hours before finding Turner guilty of
cocaine possession and transportation, but not of possessing the
drugs for sale. Sentencing was scheduled April 15.
   In another case, Turner was was to appear in Pasadena Superior
Court later Friday on charges he sold $16,000 worth of cocaine to
an undercover officer in Hollywood, said the bailiff, Deputy Robert
Goldsmith.
   Turner played backup rhythm and blues in the early 1950s before
headlining with the Ikettes. Later that decade, he met and married
Miss Turner. Together they formed the Ike and Tina Turner Revue.
Their biggest hit was ``Proud Mary.''
   The couple split in 1976, and Miss Turner went on to appear in
feature films and record the 1985 Grammy-winning record of the
year, ``What's Love Got To Do With It?''

<HEAD>Reagan Sees Hope for Settlement of Greek-Turkish Dispute Over
Cyprus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan said Friday he sees a chance
for significant progress toward settlement of the long-standing
dispute over Cyprus between Greece and Turkey.
   In a bimonthly report to Congress as required by law, the
president noted that the new special representative of the United
Nations, Oscar Camilion, visited Cyrpus shortly after the election
of George Vassilou as president in February and ``expressed his
hope that there will be progress in the near future.''
   ``We also have seen the development of a new climate between
Greece and Turkey as a result of the recent meetings between Prime
Ministers (Andreas) Papandreou and (Turgut) Ozal,'' the president
said.
   Cyprus has been split between Turkish and Greek Cypriots for 14
years. In 1983, the Turkish Cypriot minority, which makes up 17
percent of the population of 650,000, proclaimed a breakaway state
in the Turkish-occupied northern third of the Mediterranean island
nation.
   Vassilou, a leader of the 500,000 Greek Cypriots, was sworn in
as president on Feb. 28 and promised to seek direct talks with
Turkey. The Turks have about 30,000 troops and 65,000 settlers in
the northern part of Cyprus.
   Altough talks between the two sides had been deadlocked for two
years, Reagan said Papandreou and Ozal ``have resolved to increase
their cooperation and to work toward lasting solutions of the
issues dividing Greece and Turkey. We welcome this development and
resultant building of confidence and lessening of tensions in the
area.''
   These recent developments, he said, ``reinforce my belief that
there is an opportunity at this time to make real progress toward a
settlement of the dispute.''
   Reagan made his remarks in a letter to House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, and Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee.

   Anti-government protesters set fire to a
downtown department store Friday as demonstrations over the playing
of music in a tea shop persisted in the capital.
   Hundreds of students and other protester demonstrated in support
of students at the Rangoon Institute of Technology who rioted March
12 after a dispute in a tea shop.
   One student died in the violence, which began when students
argued with villagers over what songs to play on a tape player.
   Police occupied the campus Tuesday and detained a number of
students suspected of fighting the villagers.
   Larger groups of both students and villagers resumed fighting on
Sunday and about 200 students set fire to seven buildings,
according to the Burma Broadcasting Service.
   On Friday, witnesses said more than 300 students from government
high schools gathered at a public park.
   They shouted anti-government slogans, and joined by outsiders,
wrecked government cars in the area. The protesters then set fire
to a nearby government department store. Traffic was paralyzed.
   Several arrests were made before riot police dispersed the crowd
three hours after the protest began.
   Student disturbances are rare in this southeast Asian nation,
which has been under Ne Win's one-party rule since 1962.

<TEXT>
   A bipartisan group of senators today proposed
a $48 million package of new aid to Nicaragua's Contra rebels,
including renewed authority for the CIA to deliver previously
stockpiled weapons.
   Supporters said the proposal was designed to trigger
negotiations in Congress and with the Reagan administration aimed
at quick passage of an emergency infusion of aid to replace
supplies lost or expended during the past week's heavy fighting
along the Nicaraguan-Honduran border.
   ``We think it's very important right now to send a signal to the
Sandinista government'' which allegedly crossed the border into
Honduras in an effort to destroy rebel camps and supplies, said
Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., one of 11 sponsors of the new aid
proposal.
   Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., said announcement of the package
also would strengthen the Contras as they enter direct cease-fire
talks with the Managua regime on Monday.
   The proposal would use $48 million in unspent Pentagon money to
buy food, clothing, shelter and medical supplies, and to transport
it to troops in the field, over the next year. About $3 million of
that amount would go for communications gear.
   But in what promised to be a controversial provision, the
package would allow the CIA to airdrop ammunition and weapons
previously stockpiled by the rebels to troops in the field. Boren
said the rebels still have $2 million to $5 million worth of
undelivered supplies, about half of them lethal.
   And it would give President Reagan the right to hold a quick,
guaranteed vote in Congress on any request for further military aid
under certain conditions if the peace talks between the Sandinistas
and Contras break down.
   As a ``carrot,'' the bill also would promise long-term economic
aid for the region once political stability is restored.
   Sen. Daniel Evans, R-Wash., who has opposed Contra aid in the
past, said he was supporting the latest proposal because it ``is
the best way to ensure that (the peace talks) have some chance of
success.''
   Action on further aid for the rebels has been stalled since
March 3, when the House narrowly rejected a $30 million package of
purely humanitarian aid. Aid proponents saw the Sandinista
incursion into Honduras as a new opportunity to revive interest in
aid.

<HEAD>Swedish Hospital Limits Cancer Treatment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hospital is not treating cancer
patients older than 70 with radiation because of a shortage of
nurses.
   The head of the Radiumhemmet cancer clinic, Jerzy Einhorn,
called the move ``an extremely painful decision,'' but said the
hospital lacked resources to treat everyone.
   Associate Professor Ulrik Ringborg, an administrator at the
Stockholm clinic, told the Aftonbladet newspaper that no one had
been turned away because of age since the decision was adopted
March 7. Some patients, however, were offered alternative
treatments to radium.
   The hospital's decision prompted an outcry from Prime Minister
Ingvar Carlsson and government health officials. ``No one in Sweden
should be too old to receive the treatment needed,'' Carlsson said.
   Health Minister Gertrud Sigurdsen called the age limit
``unacceptable and a violation of the public health care law.''
   Long waits are common for non-urgent treatments under the
socialized medical system, but the clinic's move appeared to mark a
new level in the hospital crisis. The employee shorage has been
caused by resignations of experienced nurses, who complained of low
salaries, overtime, stress and low status.
   Funds for public medicine are distributed by the governments of
each county. Most health care is free and financed with tax money.

   The ruling Military Council on Friday
announced a government reshuffling that expands the military's role.
   There were no personnel changes in the six-man council. But one
of its members, Col. Thabe Letsie, will take on expanded duties as
foreign minister. He replaces Lengolo Monyake, who has been
reassigned as minister of works.
   Col. Ramohlanka Ntsohi also was named ambassador to nearby
Mozambique Friday. His appointment marks the first time an active
military officer has been named to a foreign diplomatic post since
Lesotho became independent from the British in 1966.
   In another change, Banda Machobane, former vice chancellor of
the University of Lesotho, has become minister of education.
   The Military Council, headed by Maj. Gen. Justin Lekhanya, has
banned all political activity since Prime Minister Leabua Jonathan
was ousted in a January 1986 coup.

   The European Space Agency has agreed after two
years of contentious negotiations to take part in the U.S. space
station project and provide a laboratory module to be permanently
attached to the Earth-orbiting facility.
   The agreement, approved by the 13-member ESA Council, provides
for cooperation in the design, development, operation and use of
the space station. The European investment in the module to be
called ``Columbus'' is expected to exceed $2 billion.
   The United States is currently in the detailed design stage of
building the space station, which is expected to be ready for
occupancy early in 1998. The estimate of U.S. costs has risen from
a projection of $8 billion made in 1984 to more than $30 billion in
current dollars.
   Japan also is expected t contribute $2 billion and Canada about
$800,000.
   Cooperation between the United States and ESA seemed doomed to
failure late in 1986 when the Pentagon announced it wanted to
retain its options for military research on the station. The
National Aeronautics and Space Administration had to assure its
European, as well as Canadian and Japanese partners, that no major
weapons systems would be placed aboard, although the research
option remains.
   NASA said the agreement ``marks the end of more than two years
of negotiations on the technical and programmatic framework between
the two agencies in the largest cooperative civil space project
undertaken.''
   In its decision Thursday, the ESA Council authorized director
general Reimer Luest to sign a memorandum of understanding with
NASA administrator James C. Fletcher in the near future.
   The memorandum of understanding is being reviewed by the Reagan
administration, then will be submitted to Congress for review
before it is signed by the two parties.
   It also has to be approved by each of the ESA member
governments: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, West Germany,
Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and
the United Kingdom.
   In addition to providing the Columbus module to the space
station complex, the ESA also will furnish an unmanned free-flying
polar-orbiting platform for Earth observation experiments. The
United States is developing a similar platform.
   As a third element, ESA will provide a free-flying spacecraft
designed to accommodate long-duration microgravity applications in
the fields of fluid physics, life and material sciences, NASA said.
That spacecraft will be visited periodically by astronauts.
   The free-flyer will be launched into an orbit, compatible with
that of the space station, by an Ariane 5 rocket.
   Presidernt Reagan invited European participation in the space
station program in 1984 and NASA and ESA agreed the following year
on what elements would be provided by each agency.

   Roman Catholics plan to demonstrate March
25 in the Slovakian capital of Bratislava to bolster calls for a
free and independent church, religious sources said Friday.
   The planned demonstration was intended to back a petition
calling for religious freedom and separation of church and state.
That petition has been signed by 400,000 Czechoslovak Catholics,
according to Slovakian church sources in Bratislava and Vienna,
Austria.
   Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek, Czechoslovakia's Catholic primate,
has urged his flock to sign the petition. It has gained support
from religious believers throughout the nation, where bishops and
priests are paid with government funds and must receive state
approval before taking their posts.
   Demonstrators also will press for quick appointment of 10 new
bishops. Government officials have been arguing with the Vatican
over the vacant posts.
   No breakthrough has been achieved so far, and the talks are
scheduled to resume in Rome on April 11, a Czechoslovak government
spokesman said this week.
   The planned demonstration was announced in a letter to local
authorities by Franitsek Miklosko, a Catholic layman, according to
the Austrian Catholic news service Kathpress. Organizers of the
rally reportedly told authorities it will be peaceful with
participants lighting candles symbolizing their support.
   There has been no comment from the government on the planned
demonstration.

<HEAD>Senate OKs Bill Boosting Nuclear Accident Insurance Pool</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate approved by voice vote Friday a
bill that would boost from $700 million to more than $7 billion the
pool of insurance available for swift disbursement to victims of a
major nuclear accident.
   Moments earlier, the chamber narrowly rejected an amendment by
Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, designed to bolster oversight of the 127
nuclear facilities run by the Department of Energy, including
plants involved in the production of nuclear weapons.
   Glenn proposed the establishment of an independent panel to
investigate safety problems at the DOE's aging reactors. But after
winning an early test vote, 47-44, he was defeated on each of four
successive roll calls in parliamentary maneuvering that saw both
sides scrambling for last-minute converts.
   On his last chance, Glenn lost, 49-42, after coming within a
vote or two in the intervening tallies.
   The Senate's action on the overall bill, a 20-year extension of
the Price-Anderson Act, sent the measure back to the House, which
approved a slightly different version last July.
   Since 1957, the law has provided for a nationwide pool of
insurance funds that would be tapped to compensate victims of an
accident at a nuclear reactor or related facility.
   Under current provisions, the pool could pay up to $700 million
if the accident involved a commercial nuclear power plant, and up
to $500 million if it involved a government-owned facility. Both
the House and Senate versions of the renewal legislation would
boost the amount in both cases to more than $7 billion.
   Glenn agreed that the monetary boost is necessary when measured
against the lessons resulting from the explosion and fire at the
Chernobyl reactor in the Soviet Union in 1986. But ``Price-Anderson
insurance is no substitute for steps to prevent a nuclear
accident,'' he said.
   Glenn cited a long history of safety and environmental problems
at the DOE's nuclear plants, including the Savannah River
production reactors in South Carolina.
   ``It is a terrible irony,'' he said, that while the nation seeks
to deter a nuclear attack by constanting upgrading its own nuclear
arsenal, ``large numbers of Americans are in danger of being
poisoned by radiation in peacetime.''
   Glenn, whose Governmental Affairs committee has revealed a
number of environmental and safety hazards at DOE plants, proposed
an independent oversight panel with the authority to appeal
directly to the president for safety improvements if the Energy
Department balked at its reports.
   The amendment was opposed by Armed Services Committee Chairman
Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and Energy Committee Chairman Bennett Johnston,
D-La. Both said they could support Glenn's proposal if it is
attached to a separate defense authorization bill later in the
year, but they argued it did not belong in the Price-Anderson
package.
   The bill would require nuclear utilities to continue to buy the
maximum amount of private liability insurance available, now
amounting to about $160 million per plant.
   If the private insurance proved insufficient to compensate
victims of an accident, each of the nation's commercial plants, now
totaling 110, would be assessed an equal amount to cover the
additional costs, to a maximum of $7.06 billion. Under that
provision, each plant could have to pay up to $63 million.
   The government, meanwhile, would self-insure its own plants, up
to the same $7 billion total. If a single accident proved even more
costly than that, it would be up to Congress whether to appropriate
additional taxpayer funds.
   The no-fault system, for both private and government plants,
shortcuts the usual legal requirements for damage claims by
eliminating the necessity for victims to bring individual lawsuits
in court. The nuclear industry has long agreed to that facet of the
program in exchange for the cap on total liability.

   Pat Robertson said Friday he is
staying in the Republican presidential race despite Vice President
George Bush's overwhelming delegate lead because ``there has to be
a rallying point for conservatives.''
   Otherwise, the former television evangelist told a news
conference, conservatives would lose their political leverage to
influence Bush on specific foreign or domestic policies or
influence his selection of a vice presidential running mate.
   ``If everybody drops out, then whatever policies are being
advocated by George Bush will become the policies of the Republican
Party,'' Robertson said.
   But, he conceded, ``if the trend continues, George Bush has a
pretty close lock on it, absent some unforeseen event.''
   ``Certainly I'm a realist and I can count,'' Robertson said,
referring to Bush's accumulation so far of more than 700 of the
1,139 delegates needed to win the GOP presidential nomination in
August. The Associated Press delegate count gives Robertson just 17
delegates.
   Robertson said he is continuing his campaign to further the
conservative principles of President Reagan.
   ``I'm a supporter of Ronald Reagan. I'd like to see the Reagan
policies of 1980 and the Republican platform of 1984 carried on to
1988,'' he said.
   Questioned about farm issues, Robertson said he wants ``a world
that is free of subsidies by the year 2000'' but that he supports
``some writedown of farm debt'' for family farmers. Robertson said
he would redirect agricultural subsidy funds from agribusiness to
family farmers.

   Eighteen members of Congress flew to Michigan
Friday trying to help revive the flagging presidential campaign of
fellow Rep. Richard Gephardt, who said, ``I'm the underdog today
but that doesn't really matter.''
   Rep. John Dingell of Trenton, Mich., said Gephardt's support in
the House was significant because ``we in Congress don't like
weaklings or phonies.''
   A new poll published Friday showed Gephardt well behind
Democratic rivals Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson in Michigan.
But the Missouri congressman said, ``I think you will see that the
Gephardt message about economic revival is going to get through to
the Michigan voters.''
   Gephardt, soundly beaten on Super Tuesday and then again this
week in Illinois, has pinned much of the future of his campaign on
the March 26 Michigan caucuses, which will allocate 138 of the
state's 150 delegates to the Democratic National Convention next
July in Atlanta.
   Eighty House members support his nomination, Gephardt has said.
Among the 18 who joined him Friday was Michigan's Rep. Dingell, who
said Gephardt's support among members of Congress reflected their
greater experience with him than with Jackson and Massachusetts
Gov. Dukakis.
   He ``is obviously a known quantity,'' Dingell said. ``We also
know how he responds in a crisis. We in Congress don't like
weaklings or phonies.''
   Gephardt dismissed a new survey, conducted for the Detroit Free
Press and WXYZ-TV and published in Friday editions of the
newspaper, that showed Dukakis and Jackson each favored by 32
percent of Michigan Democrats or others leaning toward the party.
   Gephardt was preferred by 10 percent of the 328 voters surveyed
earlier this week. Sens. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee and Paul
Simon of Illinois each had 6 percent support, and 14 percent was
undecided. The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 5
percentage points, the Free Press said.
   The candidate said he had overcome poor showings in surveys
prior to the Iowa Democratic caucuses and in other states.
   ``We're going to make political history in Michigan, just as we
did in Iowa,'' he said.
   Gephardt had also flown House colleagues in to help him in Iowa.
   That time, 42 congressmen flew on a chartered plane that cost
$15,500, an expense partially defrayed by lobbyists who flew along.
The plane ride turned into a flying fund-raiser, drawing pointed
comments from critics who noted that Gephardt was running as the
anti-establishment candidate.
   Gephardt spokesman Mark Johnson said Friday there were no
lobbyists on the plane this trip. ``You all make much more of this
than we do. This is just, send them out to a couple events and come
back.''
   The congressmen flew into Detroit on two planes, he said, one
belonging to Chrysler and the other a regular charter. ``The
campaign paid for it _ first class airfare for everybody,'' he said.

   Illegal immigrants who find amnesty
application fees too steep will be able to get interest-free loans
from the Catholic Diocese of El Paso, the bishop said Friday.
   ``I think it's good for our community for these individuals to
become citizens,'' Bishop Raymundo Pena said. ``They would have
better opportunities to get good-paying jobs and that would help
our economy.''
   Under the program, people who apply for immigration amnesty
through the diocese's Migrant and Refugee Services program are
eligible for one-year loans if they live below the federal poverty
level.
   Under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, people who
have lived in the United States illegally since before Jan. 1,
1982, are eligible for amnesty. Immigrants who qualify for amnesty
are granted temporary residency, and are eligible later for
permanent residency and then citizenship.
   The deadline for applying is May 4. The government announced
Friday it will give people seeking amnesty 60 additional days to
submit supporting documents.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service charges a filing fee
of $185 per person or a maximum of $420 per family, plus a $75
counseling fee and a $10 photo and fingerprint fee.
   Applicants also must go to a doctor for a medical exam. Often,
they hire lawyers to help them, and the search for documentation
can become expensive. The INS justifies the fees by saying they are
a way to ensure that applicants won't become public charges.
   ``I think the government has a valid argument that they should
be self-sufficient,'' Pena said at a news conference. ``But illegal
immigrants get caught in a Catch-22 situation where they can't get
a work permit, so they can't get a job that pays enough money.''
   INS spokesman Art Moreno said the agency approves of the program.
   About 27,000 people in New Mexico and West Texas have applied
for amnesty so far, Moreno said. An estimated 10 percent of those
qualified for amnesty can't afford the filing fees, the Rev. Rick
Matty said.
   The diocese needs about $60,000 to fund the loan program, and
has raised about $12,000 so far from businesses and individuals,
Pena said.

<HEAD>Police: Two Accused of Having Sex on Flight, Two of Throwing Food</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note contents.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple accused by a 13-year-old girl of having
sex on a trans-Atlantic flight were arrested, and two men who began
throwing food when a flight attendant intervened also were charged,
police said.
   The passengers were arrested when American Airlines Flight 37
from Munich, West Germany, to San Diego, Calif., made an
intermediate stop in Chicago, said Sgt. Jerry Thornton of the
police O'Hare International Airport unit.
   But Phillip Matin, 52, of Loomis, Calif., said he and his wife
were sleeping.
   ``This was the fantasy of a young girl that is completely
uncorroborated,'' Matin told the Sacramento (Calif.) Bee on
Thursday. ``It's ridiculous.''
   ``It was broad daylight, and there were people walking around,''
Matin said. ``Even at home with our kids, we are careful.''
   He and his wife, Sharyn Jo Van Tassell, 42, a lawyer and
part-time judge, were arrested Monday and charged with public
indecency.
   Police said most passengers apparently were asleep during the
Atlantic crossing when the girl motioned to her mother that she
believed the couple across the aisle was engaged in a sex act.
   The girl's mother summoned a flight attendant, who notified a
supervisor, Barbara Weiderman, Thornton said.
   Ms. Weiderman told the plane's captain, and the captain radioed
police to be on standby at O'Hare.
   At that point, two other passengers ``became abusive and
belligerent'' and began throwing food and drinks at flight
attendants, according to the police report.
   Roger F. Cline, 42, of Placerville, Calif., and Stanley Wells,
53, of Cameron Park, Calif., were both charged with disorderly
conduct.
   All four missed the continuation of their flight to San Diego,
but paid the bonds set on their misdemeanor charges and were
released pending April court appearances, police said.
   Matin, a doctor, was also charged with possession of a
controlled substance after authorities found eight yellow pills in
one of his bags. Matin said the pills were Valium but he couldn't
prove they were prescription drugs because the bottle they came
from was in his luggage.

   Merv Griffin's $225 million offer for Resorts
International Inc. has put him at odds with the hotel and casino
operator's flamboyant chairman, Donald Trump.
   Griffin Co., the former talk show host's private company, made
its $35 a share offer contingent on winning Trump's backing and his
agreement to end his five-year management agreement for Resorts'
Atlantic City, N.J., properties.
   But an attorney for Trump spurned Griffin's offer Thursday as a
``blatant attempt at market manipulation.''
   The New York real estate baron controls about 90 percent of
Resorts' voting power and is offering $22 per share to take the
company private. His lawyer claimed Griffin's offer was instigated
by another major Resorts shareholder seeking to force Trump to
raise his bid.
   Resorts' board decided Thursday that Griffin's offer was
``moot'' and reiterated its support for Trump's bid.
   In response, a spokesman for Griffin, who broke into the hotel
business late last year by buying the Beverly Hilton in Beverly
Hills for $100 million, said he is considering legal action against
Resorts' outside directors.

   Western novelist Louis L'Amour has won a
$55,000 out-of-court settlement against La Plata County and a power
company in a battle over a power line that crosses his ranch.
   Colorado-Ute Electric Association last August completed a
345,000-volt power line supported by three poles and a lattice
tower on L'Amour's 1,000-acre ranch in southwestern Colorado.
   ``I can't sit around trying to write looking at these
monsters,'' L'Amour said earlier. ``That's what these towers look
like _ monsters from Mars.''
   L'Amour has shunned 100 acres of his ranch because he fears the
power line poses a health hazard, his attorney, Russell Yates, said
Friday.
   The county agreed to pay L'Amour $4,000 and Colorado-Ute will
pay $20,000 to settle L'Amour's claim that approval for the power
line was arbitrary, Yates said. The utility also will pay $31,000
in compensation, he added.

   After two dismal seasons, many maple syrup
producers say the sap is running well this season and hope their
good luck will last.
   ``We've got it coming out of our ears. We've got so much sap we
don't know when we're going to get it all boiled in,'' said Nancy
Clark of Clark's Sugar House in Alstead.
   Clark's Sugar House, which usually produces about 1,000 gallons
a season, only made 620 last year. This year the trees have yielded
about 500 gallons.
   ``A year ago we were at 411 gallons,'' said Roger Adams of
Stuart and John's Sugar House in Westmoreland. ``This year we're at
1,250.''
   Last year, Stuart and John's produced only 1,400 gallons; in a
good year they produce up to 3,000 gallons.
   About 60 percent of the state's maple syrup is produced in the
Connecticut River valley, where producers are pressed to keep up
with the flow, said Agriculture Commissioner Steve Taylor.
   Prices have leveled at about $35 a gallon, Taylor said, adding
that even with a good season, he does not expect prices to drop
dramatically because demand remains high after the last two years.
   Annual maple syrup production in the state averages about 77,000
gallons, Taylor said. However, the last two crops yielded about
47,000 gallons, compared to the bumper crop of 102,000 gallons in
1984.
   The poor crops were directly attributable to a cycle of warm
days and warm nights. Without cool nights and warm days, sap
doesn't run.
   ``The weather has everything to do with it,'' Adams said.
   Though some producers experienced small sap runs two weeks ago,
this week's sunny weather following cool evenings had buckets and
pipelines overflowing.
   ``This last time it started running it doesn't seem it'll ever
stop,'' Clark said. Adams added that his two wood-fired evaporators
are ``going full tilt.''
   Liz Bascom, co-owner of the state's largest syrup producer,
Bascom's Sugar House in Acworth, said she was unwilling to predict
a banner year because a quick thaw could end the season as quickly
as it began.
   Shirley Sullivan of Broken Ridge Farm said the sap was running
so heavily that it almost guaranteed she would be working until
midnight.
   ``I like that,'' she said.

<HEAD>Aliens Seeking Amnesty Will Be Given Another 60 Days To File
Documents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government on Friday tried to
bolster its amnesty program by giving illegal aliens who file in
the final month of the plan 60 more days to provide documents to
support their applications.
   Under the change in the program _ which has attracted a
lower-than-anticipated number of applications _ amnesty seekers
will be able to file a skeletal application from April 4 to the May
4 deadline without producing back-up documentation and medical data
until sometime after July 5.
   The Reagan administration has said it opposes extending the
filing deadline, despite sentiment in Congress to do so.
   ``If any of you have ever filed your income tax on the night of
the 14th of April, there's usually one document or one fact you
don't get,'' Attorney General Edwin Meese III told reporters at an
immigration office in Arlington, Va. ``We want to be sure that
doesn't stop anybody from this program.''
   Just over 1 million amnesty applications have been filed, and
although a last-minute surge is anticipated, the volume of requests
is likely to fall far below the 2 million estimated as recently as
January by Alan Nelson, commission of the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
   ``Our goal is not two million,'' Meese said. ``Our goal is for
every eligible person to apply.'' If an eligible alien doesn't
apply by May 4, ``that's the person's fault, not ours,'' he added.
   Legislation with 60 co-sponsors would extend the filing deadline
for another year, but Meese opposed the idea of extending it.
   ``There's no reason to,'' he said. ``The more confusion and
hesitancy ... in the program, the more the temptation is out there
then to postpone and postpone and postpone.''
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who introduced the extension
legislation, called the change ``virtually meaningless.''
   The administration's approach assumes many illegal aliens
haven't filed because they lack documentation. But ``many illegal
aliens have not stepped forward, because they still fear the INS,''
Schumer said. ``To them the INS is the agency that is supposed to
throw them out of the country.''
   Meese said that if an extension were granted, at the end of that
time ``people would say they extended it before, they'll probably
extend it again.''
   ``It is our hope that on May 4 every single person who is
eligible for legalization will have applied,'' the attorney general
said.
   The application can be completed in less than 30 minutes, Nelson
said.
   Since the amnesty program began last May 4, INS personnel have
``gone the extra mile in all respects and it seems sad at the end
not to deal with it in a little more flexible way,'' said Jerry
Tinker, staff director of the Senate subcommittee on immigration
and refugee policy.
   Short of legislation, there were a number of administrative
steps INS could have taken, including deferring the payment of fees
_ $420 for families _ to encourage people to apply for amnesty.
   Tinker said there were extensive discussions with INS officials
over various administrative moves and ``for them to come forth with
this mouse was disappointing.''
   Under the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, illegal
aliens who have lived in the United States since Jan. 1, 1982, can
be granted amnesty if they provide documentation supporting their
claim of having lived here for the past six years.
   Meese and Nelson also announced another change in the program
that would give private groups more time to locate aliens eligible
for amnesty.
   In the past, these private groups assisting the immigration
service collected fees only after they had completed filling out
forms for an applicant, a process that can take three hours or
longer.
   Under the change, the groups will be given a referral fee for
each applicant as soon as they have directed an alien to an INS
legalization office.

   Hundreds of American
paratroopers filled the morning sky Friday in a spectacular show of
military muscle.
   U.S. Ambassador Everett Briggs said the action filled a Honduran
request for support against what he insisted was an invasion by
Nicaragua.
   ``This readiness exercise is a fine demonstration of our ability
to respond very quickly, when requested, and to show support,''
Everett Briggs told reporters at the scene of the parachute drop of
about 800 men from the 82nd Airborne Division of Fort Bragg, N.C.
   Briggs said that stories that the United States had pressured
Honduran President Jose Azcona into requesting the exercise ``are
absolutely false.''
   He said Azcona first approached him on Tuesday.
   ``They asked for ways in which we could demonstrate our
support,'' Briggs said. ``We discussed ways we might respond and
settled on this particular method.''
   Even though the White House said the cable from Azcona wasn't
received until late Wednesday, more than eight hours after troops
were put on alert for the mission, Briggs said he was sure the
letter was written Tuesday night.
   Referring to the 1,500 to 2,000 Sandinista troops who he said
have crossed into Honduras, Briggs said ``by Central American
standards, I don't think it's wrong to call it an invasion.'' He
said most of those Nicaraguan troops were still in Honduras.
   Briggs said the Honduran ministry had reported that its aircraft
``had made a couple of runs along the border'' in response to the
Sandinista invasion. He quoted the Honduran minister as saying they
hit a Nicaraguan helicopter.
   The United States was not suggesting to the Hondurans what type
of military response to make. ``This is their country and it's
their country that has had this fairly large Sandinista
incursion,'' he said. ``They've been telling us what they plan to
do and asking our support.''
   Gen. Fred F. Woerner, commander of the U.S. Southern Command
based in Panama, came here to review the exercise and said it was
``a reassuring factor to our allies, not only in Honduras, but
elsewhere.''
   Woerner said also there were ``some very, very preliminary''
indications that the Sandinistas were starting to withdraw, but he
said the duration of the U.S. exercise was ``not necessarily''
linked to that.
   Friday's parachute drop went ``absolutely super,'' said Brig.
Gen. Daniel Schroeder, commander of the Joint Task Force, who said
the force of 3,000 men would be complete later in the day after a
few more planeloads arrived with troops of the 7th Infantry
Division of Fort Ord, Calif.
   Honduran Defense Minister Wilfredo Sanchez Valladres greeted the
men shortly after they landed in the brush-covered valley about
five miles south of the air base.
   ``We thank you for coming to work with us,'' he said. ``The
morale of the Honduran people has been reinforced by this.''
   The morale of the troops also was buoyed by the chance to
conduct an exercise away from their home base and near a combat
scene.
   Schroeder smiled but deferred when asked whether he thought the
troops wanted to see action against the Sandinistas. Obviously, he
said, the men were aware of the nearby battles and he said ``the
adrenaline is pumping.''
   Sgt. Doug Longpre, 22, of the 82nd Airborne said, ``Everybody is
psyched up about being down here.''
   Hours after the paratroopers arrived, another battalion of the
82nd Airborne was flying out of Palmerola in helicopters for joint
exercises with Honduran troops in an area nearer but still 100
miles from the combat zone.
   The U.S. commanders continued to say their orders were to stay
away from actual conflict. Troops were ready and had ample
ammunition and weapons including light tanks and artillery to
respond if called upon, they said.
   The arrival of the paratroopers was the most dramatic display of
the American deployment, but most of the troops and supplies were
being delivered by a stream of jet transports that arrived every
half hour around the clock. The aerial convoy included a giant C-5
Galaxy which brought attack reconnaissance and troop-carrying
helicopters.
   The paratroopers spilled out of eight Air Force C-141 jets on a
calm, clear morning and the airbone commander said it was completed
without injury.
   Schroeder said part of the training value of the exercise was
the change in climates. They had boarded their planes at Fort Bragg
in freezing cold and then floated down in the tropical heat.

<HEAD>Security Council Holds Urgent Meeting On Central America,
Nicaraguan Request</HEAD>

   The Security Council convened an urgent
meeting today at Nicaragua's request to discuss the
Nicaraguan-Honduran conflict and the deployment of U.S. troops in
Honduras.
   The 15-member council, the highest U.N. body charged with
maintaining international peace and security, was to hear three
speakers: Nicaragua, Honduras and the United States.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said today
the United States supports the meeting.
   Asked if the United States would present ``show-and-tell''
evidence of Nicaraguan forces invading neighboring Honduras,
Fitzwater said the production of evidence is up to Honduras. He
stressed that the movement of American forces into Honduras was
strictly in response to a request of Honduran President Jose Azcona.
   The United States sent 3,200 troops to Honduras after charging
that Nicaraguan troops entered Honduras in pursuit of Contra rebels.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, meanwhile, was
studying Nicaragua's request to send an observer team to its border
with Honduras on a fact-finding mission.
   The meeting was called for information purposes and there were
no immediate plans for a resolution. The 159-member world body
usually votes with Nicaragua and other Latin American and
developing countries against the United States.
   On Thursday, Nicaragua's chief delegate, Julio Icaza Gallard,
sent a letter requesting an ``urgent and immediate'' meeting on the
U.S. action. Nicaragua's speaker was expected to be Rita Dalia
Casco, director of international organizations within the foreign
ministry.
   Earlier Thursday, Gallard denounced the United States during a
Security Council debate on British military maneuvers in the
disputed Falkland Islands claimed by Argentina.
   He condemned British ``buccaneers who pillaged our coast in the
past.''
   ``Nicaragua today is the vicim of the threats and aggression of
another American state,'' he said. ``It denounces, once again, this
gunboat policy which reflects disdain for our dignity and rights.
We must oppose them with the force of right, law, justice and the
decisive strength of international solidarity to win respect for
our sovereignty.''
   The secretary-general has urged all parties to exercise
restraint and abide by the Guatemala Accord, signed by all five
Central American nations.
   The council members are the United States, Britain, China,
France and the Soviet Union _ the ``Big Five'' permanent members
with veto power _ and Yugoslavia, Algeria, Argentina, Brazil,
Italy, Japan, Nepal, Senegal, West Germany and Zambia.

<HEAD>Police Recover Almost All Of Brink's Missing Millions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE HANDLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police on Friday announced they
recovered nearly all of the $8 million in U.S. cash that vanished
from a February air shipment from the United States to Argentina.
   It was the largest Brink's robbery in the history of the
company, which was protecting the cash.
   The money was recovered by narcotics agents working for Rio de
Janeiro's Specialized Police Department.
   Four suspects, all Brazilian employees of a private cargo firm
that operated at Rio's International Airport, were arrested.
   ``It's obvious they planned it together. We are going to
interrogate them to find out how they pulled it off,'' said Nilo
Augusto Batista, head of the Specialized Police Department.
   The suspects and the recovered money were shown to reporters at
the narcotics squad's headquarters, a dilapidated,
turn-of-the-century building in downtown Rio.
   The suspects, all appearing to be in their late 20s, hid their
faces from reporters and clicking cameras and refused to answer any
questions.
   The money was part of a $52 million shipment from the Federal
Reserve Board in New York to the Central Bank of Argentina, said
Marven Moss, a spokesman for Brink's Inc., based in Darien, Conn.
   The money disappeared Feb. 5 when 13 canvas sacks containing $52
million were transferred in Rio's International Airport from a
flight from New York to one to the Argentine capital of Buenos
Aires. Two of the sacks never made it to Argentina.
   Batista said the cargo company which hired the four suspects
``took the money out of the first plane, put it on a cart and took
it in for inspection by government officials. Afterward the money
was placed inside vans and taken to the second plane'' for the trip
to Argentina. Somewhere along the line $8 million vanished.
   He said the first break in the case came when the narcotics
squad of his department came across certain information about the
theft apparently from tipsters with connections to Rio's drug
trafficking world.
   ``Even though this case was, technically, not in the drug area,
our people followed the tip, and the result was nearly total
success,'' Batista said. He added that the dollars were traced to
the states of Sao Paulo, Espirito Santo, Minas Gerais and Rio de
Janeiro, where the thieves tried to exchange them, apparently for
other American dollars or for foreign currency.
   Narcotics Division Detective Antonio Carlos Estevam, who
coordinated the three-man team that arrested the four suspects and
found the money, said ``it was a combination of solid police work
and luck. We have no crystal ball.''
   ``Usually, when there is a large theft of money, most of it
gravitates to the drug world. This is the theory we operated on
after the airport incident. I would say we have achieved what no
police force anywhere else has ever achieved. We captured all the
suspects, recovered practically all the money and no one was
hurt,'' Estevam said.
   Estevam said the operation started Thursday when two of the
suspects were arrested in a car in the Ilha do Governador district
located near the airport. Later that day, two more suspects were
arrested and the money was recovered.
   Batista said the four suspects were Brazilians and that there
were no signs of involvement by foreigners. He added that none of
the money wound up in the hands of drug dealers.
   The recovered money belongs to Brink's, since its insurance
repaid the Federal Reserve Board for the theft, Moss said.

   Parents and schools are keeping closer
watch on their children as authorities and volunteers look for a
man who has tried to lure youngsters into his car in New
Hampshire-Massachusetts border communities.
   Police report that the man has approached children at least a
dozen times in the last three weeks in Atkinson and Plaistow, as
well as over the border in Merrimac, Haverhill and Methuen, Mass.
   Generally, they say, he drives alongside youngsters walking
alone in the late afternoon or early evening, rolls down the window
and asks the children their names and where they are going, then
offers a ride.
   The man has driven slowly by children in his town, shouting,
``I'm going to get you,'' Atkinson Police Chief Phillip Consentino
said.
   So far, police say, he has not been able to lure anyone into his
big brown or maroon car, but he gotten out and chased a couple of
kids, one of whom escaped to home as the man fell on ice.
   ``My concern is that there is going to be one gullible kid out
there that is going to get in a car,'' said Plaistow police Sgt.
Thomas Bourque. ``Then who knows what is going to happen.''
   He said a Plaistow youngster was chased on foot by the man, who
got back into his car and left when the youngster ran to a house
and pounded on the door.
   Police have distributed a composite drawing of the man, and it
is posted in schools and on school buses. Schools are scheduling
programs to teach children how to deal with strangers and to
instruct parents.
   Bus drivers have met to talk about how to better protect their
riders, and Atkinson police have been following buses.
   In Plaistow, police in unmarked cars, people from the schools or
parents have been watching for the stalker.
   Bourque said kids are ``showing some fear,'' but ``seem to know
what to do _ they are running. They don't talk to the guy.''
   The children are fleeing so quickly, that none has been able to
get the license plate number of the man's car.

<HEAD>`Come And Get It' _ Sure, But How Long Does It Take?</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State Treasurer Ann Richards has been
loudly urging Texans to claim long-forgotten money left in state
coffers, but Joseph Phillips is finding it hard to heed her call.
   ``How long does it take?'' Phillips, 48, asked Thursday, more
than seven months after first filing to reclaim $900 from the state.
   The money belongs to Phillips and his sister, Patricia Crawford,
and was part of a trust left by their father, who died in 1985. The
money was left erroneously to languish in a bank account and found
its way into the treasury under a law stipulating that accounts
inactive for at least three years be turned over to the state.
   The treasurer's office says there is no question that Phillips
should get the money. It is part of about $60 million owned by
75,000 residents and companies but held by the state.
   ``You can be assured that if you have money coming to you, you
will get it,'' Ms. Richards said at a press conference earlier this
month to publicize efforts to return the money.
   But Phillips was not assured: ``I thought, if they are that slow
in responding to me, how in the world are they going to handle more
claims?''
   Phillips first filed his claim with the treasury last Aug. 7
after a trust official told him about the money. In January, he
filled out another form. Later, he discovered his sister also would
have to complete a form, which took him several weeks just to
obtain.
   Three weeks later, after reading about Ms. Richards' news
conference, Phillips wrote The Dallas Morning News.
   A spokesman for Ms. Richards conceded to the News that the claim
had taken too long. He said the claim was complicated and that a
series of miscues, including a change of address by the Unclaimed
Property Division, caused delays.
   ``We are expediting a check,'' he told the News. Phillips will
get his check within four weeks _ after it's cleared by the
attorney general's office, he assured.

<HEAD>Dockworkers Rebel Against Army Takeover; Noriega Purges Forces</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By REID G. MILLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angry dockworkers moved massive
blockades across the entrance to their port near the Panama Canal
on Friday to fight off an army takeover by troops loyal to Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Noriega fired his intelligence chief and four other officers in
an apparent purge of his fractured Defense Forces, which came two
days after a failed coup attempt against the military strongman.
   Four American military police officers were arrested in the
capital by Panamanian authorities and held for several hours, the
Pentagon said.
   The Panamanian newspaper Critica said the Americans were
carrying handguns, maps of the capital and ``military implements''
when they were detained in an area ``where daily activities
disturbing the public order'' had occurred.
   Panamanians, without cash for weeks, lined up at public parks
and pay stations to receive partial payment and bags of food being
doled out by the government.
   Noriega gave no reason for Friday's ousters.
   Col. Bernardo Barrera had been in charge of intelligence for the
15,000-member Defense Forces, which includes Panama's army, navy,
police and air force.
   A source close to the Defense Forces said Barrera might have
been faulted for not knowing in advance of Wednesday's coup
attempt, which was said to have involved a few junior officers lead
by the nation's police chief, Col. Leonidas Macias.
   The other ousted officers were identified by the military press
office as Majs. Juan Oberto, Pablo Pinto and Jose Williams and
Capt. Orlando Iguez. Their units and positions were not disclosed.
   At the Balboa Port, about a mile outside the Panama Canal, about
300 striking dockworkers moved car-sized containers across the port
entrance to fight off an army takeover ordered Thursday by the
government.
   ``The port is shut down,'' said one dockworker. ``We won't
accept anything less than what they owe us,'' he said, asking not
to be identified for fear of reprisal. ``We'll wait here for them
(the army).''
   Four shipping containers were stacked across the port entrance.
They formed a barricade nearly 20 feet high and no vehicles or
machinery were passing in or out.
   Ports at Panama City and Colon, used primarily to receive and
ship cargo, closed Monday when dockworkers angry about not being
paid went on strike. The Panama Canal Commission said the shutdowns
had no effect on its operations.
   In addition to the ports, the military was ordered to take over
the nation's electrical, water and telephone companies, airports,
and the ministries of education, health and finance, all of which
had been struck by workers demanding salaries.
   The four American military police arrested Thursday night in
Panama City were identified by the Critica newspaper as Danny H.
Feltro, William Jerry, Virts Richard and Tammy Markley.
   The newspaper did not provide their ranks or other information,
and the Pentagon said Friday it could not immediately confirm the
identities printed by the paper.
   A U.S. Southern Command statement in Panama City said the four
were members of a military police detachment checking on the
``security of dependent families'' living in the area in which they
were detained.
   The U.S. militry dependents, like everyone else in Panama, have
been without lights and water for extended periods because of the
recent strikes.
   Long lines of public employees, including teachers and
electrical workers, gathered at special pay stations around the
capital to receive partial payment of their semi-monthly salaries.
   Each employee was receiving only $75, sometimes with $35 paid in
old, commemorative Panamanian coins kown as Balboas.
   The government also began handing out free bags of food
containing beans, rice, processed cheese and other staples of the
Panamanian diet. It had been selling the bags for between $14 and
$15.
   More than 1,200 people lined up for the bags at a park near the
center of the city to receive food.
   The government, short of cash for months because of its
inability to renegotiate a huge foreign debt, began running out of
money three weeks ago when depositors began a run on the country's
banks.
   The bank run began on Feb. 26, the day after Noriega deposed the
nation's president, Eric Arturo Delvalle, in a thinly disguised
coup. Devalle had tried to fire Noriega the day before in a move
that backfired.
   The action by Delvalle, who still is recognized by the United
States, came after Noriega was indicted by two grand juries in
Florida on charges of narcotics trafficking.

   Illinois Sen. Paul Simon said Friday he
is having trouble raising money but took a jab at better-financed
Democratic presidential rivals, saying ``If you're talking about
buying the nomination, I can't do that.''
   Simon, in Pennsylvania for a series of fund-raising events, said
none of the five remaining candidates in the Democratic field can
win enough delegates to claim the nomination on the first ballot at
the Atlanta convention this summer.
   Even Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, who has a narrow lead
in delegates, would need to pick up 80 percent of the delegates in
remaining states to have the 2,082 needed to win the nomination,
Simon told a news conference.
   ``That just isn't going to happen, so we're going to have a
wide-open convention,'' he said. ``I think you're going to see a
wide-open process and I think it's going to be a very healthy thing
for the country.''
   He acknowledged he is still having trouble raising money, but
said he expects to remain competitive and bring in more money as he
wins more delegates. Simon won his first primary on Tuesday in his
homestate.
   ``If you're talking about buying the nomination, I can't do
that. If you're talking about winning the nomination, I can do
that,'' he said. ``I intend to be in the race through Atlanta,
through November the 8th.''
   Earlier in the day, Simon met briefly with Gov. Robert P. Casey,
who has not yet endorsed a candidate for president and might not
before the primary.
   ``I really have to make a basic decision on whether or not to
get involved and that's the process I'm going through now,'' Casey
said.
   Simon said he would not seriously contest the March 26 Michigan
caucuses but predicted he would do well in the April 5 Wisconsin
primary and the April 19 New York primary, which is one week before
Pennsylvania's vote.
   Commenting on his chances here, Simon said, ``I am candid in
saying if there were a poll taken today in Pennsylvania, I'm sure
Paul Simon would not emerge on the top. But after the headlines and
the television coverage for Wisconsin and New York, you're going to
have a very different situation in Pennsylvania.''

<HEAD>High-Ranking East German Leads Police To Alleged Spy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A high-ranking East German transport
official defected to West Germany and led authorities Friday to
arrest a suspected communist spy, officials and news reports said.
   The mass-circulation newspaper Bild said the woman was arrested
following the interrogation of the defector and was suspected of
having spied for East Germany.
   West German officials identified her as a secretary in the
federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation.
   Earlier Friday, security sources said Ulrich Fuchs, one of the
four deputy directors of East Germany's state-run Deutrans
transport company, had defected to West Germany.
   The sources, who requested anonymity, said West German
intelligence officials hoped to learn more about how East Germany
uses its long-haul trucks to spy on the West.
   Bild said the woman had access to secret documents provided to
the ministry by West Germany's intelligence service. The documents
dealt mainly with the situation in Third World countries, such as
Nicaragua and Angola, the newspaper said.
   The national television network ARD said the documents did not
contain military information.
   Alwin Brueck, a former state secretary in the ministry in whose
office the woman worked for some time, identified the suspect as
Elke Falk, according to ARD.
   Bild said the woman returned several days ago from a vacation in
Austria, where she may have met with communist colleagues.
   Hans-Juergen Foerster, spokesman for the federal prosecutor's
office, confirmed the woman's arrest but declined to link the two
cases.
   He said the woman, whom he refused to identify, was in
investigative custody. She is suspected of having supplied
information to a communist secret service since 1975, when she met
an agent known to authorities under the false name of Gerhard
Thieme, Foerster said. He declined to identify the communist agency.
   Bild said Thieme was an East German agent who recruited the
woman after seducing her. She is in her 40s and worked in the
ministry's European section since 1987, following other positions
in the ministry, the newspaper said.
   West Germany's counterespionage agency had placed the woman
under surveillance one year ago, Bild said.
   Several government secretaries have been unmasked as communist
spies in recent years.
   Margret Hoeke, a long-time secretary in the West German
president's office, was convicted of spying for the Soviet KGB and
sentenced to eight years in prison last August. During her trial,
Ms. Hoeke described how she began spying after falling in love with
an East Bloc agent.
   Sonja Luenburg, chief secretary to Economic Minister Martin
Bangemann, vanished in August 1985 and is believed to have fled to
East Germany.
   West German sources said Fuchs was undergoing interrogation by
counterespionage officials at an undisclosed location in West
Germany.
   They said Fuchs had also unofficially worked for the East German
secret service, ``but apparently was no big fish.''
   The sources added that further questioning of Fuchs could give
more insights into his activities for the communist secret service.
   But Bild quoted unidentified security experts as saying Fuchs
was one of the most important defectors in 10 years.
   The newspaper said Friday Fuchs defected in early March during a
business trip to the West.
   Bild said Fuchs knew ``everything about the secret spying trucks
of East Germany and the Soviet Union, he knows secret meeting
points for agents and courier methods used by communist spies.''
   Quoting an unidentified counterespionage expert, Bild said the
West Germans hoped to learn about the electronic equpiment built
into Soviet bloc trucks, the routes they take while traveling
through the West and about ``safe houses'' used by communist agents.
   West German security officials long have suspected East German
truckers of using their drives through West Germany to report on
military movements and gather other information for the East German
secret service.
   Bild said about 3,000 Deutrans trucks pass through West Germany
every month. The trucks are usually equipped with sensitive cameras
and electronic listening devices, Bild said.

   A White House comission on Friday said the
government should turn over to private businesses the operation of
prisons, air traffic control facilities, mail delivery and scores
of other services.
   Agencies now providing those services ``have become muscle-bound
to the point of paralysis,'' the panel's chairman, David F.
Linowes, told reporters after presenting President Reagan with what
he called the first ``independent, exhaustive analysis'' of the
privatization issue.
   Linowes, however, acknowledged that the bulk of the 78
recommendations in the 278-page report by the President's
Commission on Privatization are unlikely to be enacted before
Reagan's term ends next Janaury.
   ``We didn't take on this job with the expectation that it would
stay with just one administration,'' he said. ``For the most part
we opt for an incremental approach. We know Americans don't take
kindly to sudden change. They like them to evolve.''
   The recommendations include repealing laws that created the U.S.
Postal Service's monopoly, putting the Federal Aviation
Administration's flight service facilities and control towers out
for private bids and selling the naval petroleum reserves in
California and Wyoming.
   The panel also called for the use of vouchers or direct
subsidies to individuals for housing, education and elderly care
rather than pouring any more money into public housing projects or
federal aid for public schools.
   And the commission would sell to private banks and other
financial institutions the government's $250 billion portfolio of
housing, business, agriculture and education loans.
   ``Government should not be in the business of business,''
Linowes said. ``The well-developed banking industry can take over
those loans ... freeing up billions of dollars for the federal
treasury.''
   Many of the recommendations, such as selling the petroleum
reserves and government loans, have been proposed in the past by
Reagan and rejected soundly in Congress each time.
   And critics were quick Friday to predict that initiatives based
on the White House commission's report also would fail.
   ``Luckily, it won't fool anybody except those who want to
believe it,'' said Robert M. Tobias, president of the 59,000-member
National Treasury Employees Union. ``It should die with the rest of
the administration's foolish ideas at the end of 1988.''
   However, Linowes, a Democrat, said he believes lawmakers
gradually will warm to the recommendations as the work of an
independent, bipartisan commission.
   ``The facts will argue for themselves,'' he said. ``For example,
vouchers will provide the same amount of low-income housing for
one-third the cost of public housing.''
   Linowes said all of the commission's recommendations include two
caveats:
   ``First, government must never abdicate its responsibilities for
setting policy and standards; and second, the rights of current
employees cannot be abrograted as a result of these changes.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, reflecting the scant
attention that the administration gave to privatization in its
proposed 1989 budget except for pilot studies involving military
commissaries and federal prisons, called the report forward-looking.
   ``The work ... is close to the president's philosphy of
government,'' Fitzwater said. Reagan ``campaigned ... on a platform
of limited government. ... We are continuing those efforts.''
   Reagan appointed the 13-member commission last September, and
Linowes estimated the cost of its study at $450,000.
   He said the panel found that most agencies, often because
workers lack incentives for coming up with new ideas, ``are trying
to deal with today's problems using yesterday's solutions.''
   For example, he said visits to air traffic control towers
revealed the use of outdated computers.
   ``The checks and balances of government do not lend themselves
to managing high technology,'' Linowes said. ``Government should
reach out by opening its operations to the creative talents and
drive of entrepreneurs.''

   Conservatives launched a campaign Friday to
persuade President Reagan to pardon Lt. Col. Oliver L. North, with
one saying, ``Juries don't convict heroes who stand 10 feet tall.''
   ``Indicting a true American hero _ at a tremendous cost _ is
completely unacceptable and should be rejected immediately,'' L.
Francis Bouchey, president of the Council for Inter-American
Security, said in a statement issued at a news conference.
   In a related development, Pentagon sources said Friday that
North has asked to retire from the Marine Corps. North submitted
his request Thursday, asking that he be allowed to retire effective
May 1, when he will have completed 20 years of active military
service, the sources said.
   The conservatives said they have formed an ``Ollie North Task
Force'' to lobby for a pardon for North and John M. Poindexter,
former head of the National Security Council.
   Sen. Steven Symms, R-Idaho, sent a letter to Reagan asking him
to pardon North, Symms office said.
   The two former White House aides _ along with arms dealers
Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakim _ have been charged with
conspiring to defraud the government in the Iran-Contra episode.
The case involved diverting money from the sale of weapons to Iran
to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Bill Kling of The Foreign Policy Project said he thought the
public supported North. ``Juries don't convict heroes who stand 10
feet tall,'' he said.
   North and Poindexter are a ``package deal,'' on pardons,
according to Andrew Messing, head of the National Defense Council
Foundation.
   But he and others refused to commit themselves to seeking
pardons for Secord and Hakim.
   Messing said Secord and Hakim were in a different category
because they were businessmen who stood to gain personally from the
Iran-Contra affair, he said.
   Marlin Fitzwater, Reagan's spokesman, said there have been no
discussions at the White House about possible pardons.

   Leftist guerrillas on Friday
burned buses, taxis and other vehicles that defied their nationwide
ban on transport, and they threatened more sabotage to disrupt
weekend elections.
   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, an alliance of
five guerrilla groups, claimed its fighters attacked three soldiers
guarding a gas station outside this capital.
   The armed forces press office said it could not confirm or deny
the report, made on the guerrilla radio station. The radio said
three soldiers were killed or wounded, but it didn't give details.
   The guerrilla Radio Venceremos said ``our demolition squads will
carry out new actions in repudiation of the elections.'' It also
said ``urban commando cells are carrying out actions to ensure the
transport ban's success.''
   Salvadorans on Sunday elect all 60 members of the legislative
National Assembly and mayors and municipal councils nationwide. The
guerrillas, who have been fighting the U.S.-backed government since
1979, call the elections a farce. They say free and fair balloting
is impossible in wartime.
   They decreed an indefinite nationwide transport ban beginning
Friday to protest and disrupt the elections.
   A poll published Friday by San Salvador's Central American
University indicated more than 80 percent of prospective voters
intend to cast ballots despite the guerrilla call for a boycott.
But the same poll indicated about half the electorate either
rejects all the candidates or remains undecided.
   The poll of 914 people in 11 of the country's 14 provinces gave
the rightist National Republican Alliance, or Arena, an edge over
the governing Christian Democrats in the Assembly vote.
   The centrist Christian Democrats have 33 deputies but are
expected to lose that majority. No leftist party is participating
in the elections.
   The privately owned radio station YSU, with correspondents in
almost all 14 provinces, said guerrillas burned eight vehicles in
the eastern province of Usulutan. The radio, citing police and
armed forces officials, said the vehicles destroyed were two buses,
two tractor-trailers, two pickups, one jeep and one taxi. No
injuries were reported in the destruction of the vehicles.
   There were no other reports of violence from other provinces.
   Intercity bus transport was reduced by about 80 percent
nationwide, according to dispatchers. The capital's two main bus
terminals were virtually deserted Friday morning.
   One person died and 18 were injured when an overcrowded pickup
overturned in the capital.
   Scores of pickups with people packed in the beds and standing on
the bumpers circulated in San Salvador, partially taking the place
of privately owned buses, none of which was seen on the road.
   The pickup owners were charging 60 cents _ six times the normal
bus fare.
   The government put several dozen blue and white state-owned
buses on the street, and they, too, were overcrowded, with people
riding on the roof luggage rack, hanging from the doors and
standing on the bumpers. Army trucks also were used for passenger
transport.
   Many people simply walked to work.
   Of 10 people randomly consulted on the city sidewalks, not one
supported the transport ban.
   ``It hurts everybody,'' said computer programmer Jose Ortiz. He
said he thought election turnout would be high ``because lots of
people feel they made a mistake last time they voted and now they
want a change.''
   He cited what he said were the Christian Democrats' unkept
promises.
   ``The (transport) ban is a problem for all of us. It makes a
tough situation even tougher,'' said Ricardo Quintanilla, a
laboratory worker consulted during his three-mile walk to work.
   About the elections, he said: ``They don't offer much hope for
solutions to the country's problems. But voting is a habit, so lots
of people will vote.''

<HEAD>Head of Southern Command Says Panamanian Defense Forces Ruptured</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>

   The following dispatch was filed by Frederick
Kempe of the Wall Street Journal, a member of a Pentagon press pool
covering the arrival of U.S. troops in Honduras.
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>PALMEROLA AIR BASE, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The commander-in-chief of
the U.S. Southern Command said he was skeptical that U.S.-backed
efforts to oust Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
would bring any quick results.
   ``Putting a time line on Gen. Noriega is probably one of the
greatest hazards of our profession,'' said Gen. Fred Woerner, who
was on an inspection mission to observe the arrival of about 800
paratroops from the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne Division.
   He said this week's failed coup attempt showed that the
``solidarity of the Panamanian Defense Forces has been ruptured.''
   Woerner ruled out the possibility of using U.S. troops to help
bring down Noriega, something he said was a matter for the
Panamanian people.
   He wouldn't comment on whether the United States military would
respond if Panamanian President Eric Arturo Delvalle requested its
assistance in the future.
   Delvalle has been in hiding since his aborted attempt to fire
Noriega as military leader last month. Noriega responded by forcing
the ouster of Delvalle, but the United States still regards him as
Panama's constitutional leader. Noriega has been indicted by two
federal grand juries in Florida on drug-trafficking charges.
   Woerner provided a gloomy description of Panama's internal
situation in his brief remarks during the second day of maneuvers
here.
   ``The city is locked up. The economy has come to a standstill.
The people are afraid, intimidated. The normal political processes
are non-functioning. People are desperately struggling for their
basic freedoms,'' he said.

   Bonnie Miskanin has been the wife of an
82nd Airborne Division paratrooper for six years. Two days ago, she
found out exactly what that means.
   Her husband, Sgt. Donald Miskanin, ``left for work about 4:15
a.m. Wednesday,'' she said. ``The day went on and everything was
fine when I noticed around 6 o'clock that he wasn't home yet.''
   Mrs. Miskanin, 27, said she called a friend whose husband was in
the same unit as her husband at Fort Bragg.
   ``She told me they had been deployed to Honduras,'' she said
Friday.
   The United States deployed 3,200 U.S. troops, 2,000 of them from
the 82nd Airborne, after reported incursions into Honduras by
Nicaraguan soldiers pursuing Contra rebels. The last of the troops
left early Friday for what is described as a non-combat show of
force.
   Mrs. Miskanin said 6-year-old Donald Jr. has been taking his
father's absence ``very rough.''
   As for herself, she said she had been drawing on the support of
friends, family and other Army wives.
   ``We just stick together,'' she said. ``We act like our husbands
are right here in the field.''
   Paula Arndt, 21, said she also relied on other Army wives since
the departure of her husband, Spec. 4 Chester Arndt, whom she
hasn't seen since Wednesday morning.
   ``The more the pressure keeps building, you have to let it
out,'' she said. ``You take it day by day. I'll be taking care of
my baby, doing my household chores, and doing a lot of praying.''
   As the last of the troops from the fort prepared to leave
Thursday, soldiers said they were excited but also nervous.
   ``I'm only 18,'' said Pfc, James Bullard Jr. of Shallotte, a
soldier since July. ``Yeah, I get scared. You don't know what's
going to happen. All I know is we're going on a readiness exercise.
I'm nervous, real nervous.
   ``But I signed on the dotted line, so I have to deal with it,''
he said.

   DeWitt Bodeen, who wrote or was co-writer on
scripts for the films ``Cat People'' and ``Billy Budd,'' has died.
He was 79.
   Bodeen, who began his career as an actor and was a former board
member of the Writers Guild of America, died March 12 of bronchial
pneumonia at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital, said
spokeswoman Jean Ferris.
   In addition to ``Cat People,'' Bodeen's scriptwriting during the
1940s included ``The Seventh Victim,'' ``The Curse of the Cat
People,'' ``The Yellow Canary,'' ``I Remember Mama,'' ``Mrs.
Mike,'' ``The Girl in the Kremlin'' and ``Twelve to the Moon.''
   He also wrote ``The Enchanted Cottage'' with Herman J.
Mankiewicz, and in 1962 collaborated with Peter Ustinov on ``Billy
Budd.''
   Bodeen worked in New York and California, and in the late 1930s
became a script reader at RKO Pictures, which led to a seven-year
contract as a staff writer.
   In the 1950s he returned to New York and wrote for such
television shows as ``Climax,'' ``Lux Video Theater'' and ``Four
Star Playhouse.''
   In 1969 the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
commissioned him to help edit the book ``Who Wrote the Film.''
   He also produced a volume of 12 vignettes of actresses, ``Ladies
of the Footlights.'' His last book was ``The Films of Cecil B.
DeMille.'' He retired in 1977.
   There were no services.

   Democratic presidential candidate
Michael Dukakis criticized the Reagan administration's sending of
troops to Honduras as he split his campaign day Friday between
Michigan and Kansas.
   He spoke with junior high school students in Michigan, then flew
to Kansas, where Democrats hold party caucuses on Saturday. He was
returning Friday night to Michigan for appearances at union halls
with Sen. Edward Kennedy. Michigan's Democratic primary is one week
from Saturday.
   ``The whole policy in Central America is illegal,'' Dukakis said
at a news conference after addressing a student assembly at Mason
Junior High School in Drayton Plains, just outside Pontiac.
   ``Call back the troops and end this,'' he said.
   The Massachusetts governor said the assignment of troops to
Central America runs against agreements signed by members of the
Organization of American States. He said if he were president, he
would end aid to the Contra rebels and back a Central American
peace plan drafted by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias and signed
by five Central American nations.
   ``As long as you have an administration that's obsessed with the
overthrow of that government (in Nicaragua), the peace process
cannot begin,'' Dukakis said.
   On Tuesday, Dukakis had failed to win any delegates in the
Illinois primary. But despite gains in Illinois by favorite sons
Paul Simon and Jesse Jackson, Dukakis dismissed what some have
suggested is a growing possibility of a brokered convention, one in
which no candidate enters with a clear majority.
   ``I've always felt from the beginning that somebody would emerge
... from the primary process with a good plurality, particularly if
the field begins to thin down a little bit,'' he said.
   On other matters, Dukakis:
   _Urged a reduction in military spending through scaling back the
president's Star Wars space-based missile defense program. ``If
you're going to spend $6 billion on Star Wars, you can't spend $6
billion on housing,'' he said.
   _Spoke broadly about a change in U.S. policy in the Middle East,
saying the United States must show leadership in the region. ``My
secretary of state would have been pushing ahead as a follow-up on
the Camp David accords,'' he said.

   Democratic presidential candidate
Albert Gore Jr. on Friday sought the favor of Puerto Rico voters
ahead of their Sunday primary, saying he would consider allowing
the territory to be exempt from federal minimum wage laws.
   Gore, addressing potential delegates of the Popular Democratic
Party of Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon, also said he favored letting
Puerto Rico decide itself whether to become a U.S. state.
   Gore appeared in person while another Democratic candidate,
Michael Dukakis, made a videotaped address in Spanish to the same
delegates. Dukakis said if he is elected, he would work to increase
payments to Puerto Ricans under the Medicaid, Aid to Families with
Dependent Children, and Supplemental Security Income programs.
   ``During the past several years, unfortunately, Puerto Rico has
not received from the federal government the help it deserves in
the fight for economic opportunity for everyone,'' Dukakis said.
   A main issue in the campaign is control of the local Democratic
Party. Both the PDP, which favors the political status quo, and the
rival New Progressive Party, which favors statehood, want to use
the party to win appointments and influence legislation in
Washington.
   Democratic and Republican primaries in this Caribbean island of
3.5 million located 1,000 miles southeast of Florida are set for
Sunday. The State Election Commission projects that 1 million
voters _ more than one of every two _ will cast ballots.
   The Democrats will choose 51 delegates, all of them officially
uncommitted.
   Fourteen GOP delegates are at stake in a winner-take-all vote
that George Bush is expected to dominate.
   Only Bush, who won the 1980 primary and is strongly linked with
the pro-statehood movement, organized a real campaign.
   On Friday in a telephone interview with a local broadcast
station, Bush defended the sending of U.S. troops to Honduras.
   ``We did the proper thing,'' he said. ``We are for freedom and
democracy. There is no question that Nicaragua invaded Honduras.''
   Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens with most every right and
obligation except they cannot vote for president and do not pay
federal taxes. Puerto Ricans may, however, vote in presidential
primaries.

the San Jose (Calif.) Mercury News, The Charlotte (N.C.) Observer,
and the Detroit Free Press; eight network television stations, an
international business information services company, and interests
in cable television and newsprint operations.
   Batten, 52, has been president of Knight-Ridder since 1982. He
is also a member of The Associated Press board of directors.
   He worked as a reporter for The Charlotte Observer and spent
five years as a correspondent in Knight-Ridder's Washington bureau,
specializing in Southern politics and civil rights.
   He also has worked as assistant city editor for the Detroit Free
Press, executive editor of The Charlotte Observer, Knight-Ridder's
vice president for news, and senior vice president for news. He was
elected to the board of directors in 1981.
   Chapman joined the Knight organization in 1960, became vice
president and general manager of The Miami Herald, and was The
Herald's president from 1969 to 1983.

   Catholics buried two more
victims of sectarian violence Friday in peaceful services that
followed 10 straight nights of rioting in Belfast.
   One of the victims, Thomas McErlean, 20, was killed in an attack
during an Irish Republican Army funeral at the Milltown Catholic
Cemetery on Wednesday.
   Police said a Protestant gunman grabbed by mourners following
the attack will be charged with murder next week. The gunman,
Michael Stone, 33, is accused of the assault in which three people
were killed and 68 injured.
   Stone also will be charged with ``other serious crimes,
including murder'' not connected with the Milltown attack, said the
police spokesman. He spoke on condition he not be identified.
   Stone was beaten by the Roman Catholic crowd that captured him
and was under armed guard in a hospital. An alleged accomplice also
remained under arrest.
   Press Association, the domestic British news agency, said Stone
also was being questioned about 10 other sectarian killings.
   Also buried Friday was Charles McGrillen, 25, who was shot
Monday outside a Belfast supermarket. The outlawed Ulster Freedom
Fighters, a Protestant extremist group, claimed responsibility for
his shooting.
   The IRA fired a three-volley salute, its traditional tribute,
Thursday night for Kevin Brady, 30, a member shot dead in the
cemetery attack as he chased the gunman.
   Hooded IRA men fired the volleys, which are prohibited, as
Brady's coffin was being taken from his home to St. Agnes Roman
Catholic Chapel, where a funeral mass is scheduled for Saturday.
   Security forces kept a low profile as McGrillen and McErlean
were buried in separate funerals Friday.
   The Ulster Freedom Fighters expressed guarded support for the
cemetery attack.
   ``We understand his frustrations and motives, and we do not
condemn his actions,'' the group's statement said of the gunman who
opened fire and threw hand grenades at the mourners in the cemetery.
   A caller, who gave a code word to prove authenticity, telephoned
the statement to the Belfast newsroom of the British Broadcasting
Corp.
   Gerry Adams, president of the outlawed IRA's legal political
wing, Sinn Fein, said at a news conference that Stone was not ``a
lone lunatic'' and reiterated charges that the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, the province's mainly Protestant police force,
colluded in the attack.
   ``I do know he wasn't a kamikaze because he wore gloves, he wore
a cap, he had plotted out a route and he did intend to escape,''
Adams said.
   The allegations of collusion have been rejected by the Royal
Ulster Constabulary and denied by Northern Ireland Secretary Tom
King, Britain's top official in the province.
   Adams said Sinn Fein has launched its own inquiry into the
attack.
   He sat at a table flanked with pictures from the Republican
News, Sinn Fein's weekly newspaper, which had photographs of two
guns it said were recovered at the cemetery and the gunman's black
beret and gloves.
   The paper said a Browning 9mm automatic pistol manufactured in
Belgium was taken from the captured gunman. It had jammed with 12
rounds of ammunition left, the paper said.
   A .357-caliber Magnum revolver similar to those used by the
Royal Ulster Constabulary in the early 1980s was found at the
cemetery, the paper said.
   Asked whether the guns would be turned over to police, Adams
said he did not know where the weapons were.
   In the sporadic overnight rioting, which died down in the early
hours of Friday, Catholic youths hurled gasoline bombs at police
patrols and a row of Protestant homes in Belfast and burned and
hijacked cars.

   A judge declared a mistrial Friday in the case

Dinh Nhu, who is accused of slaying their parents two years ago.
   Judge Fred Ugast of District of Columbia Superior Court ruled
Khiem incompetent to testify about the strangulation deaths of his
elderly parents, who had lived in Washington since resigning from
their diplomatic posts with the old South Vietnamese government in
1963.
   Ugast issued his ruling ``with great reluctance,'' after a
court-appointed psychologist examined the defendant Thursday and
found him ``profoundly delusional.''
   Ugast ordered Khiem returned to St. Elizabeths Hospital, a city
mental institution, for 90 days. He said the court would then
reconsider whether Khiem could testify.
   Khiem, 62, is charged with two counts of first-degree murder in
the July 1986 deaths of his father, Tran Van Chuong, 88, former
South Vietnamese ambassador to the United States, and his mother,
Nam Tran Chuong, 82, former observer to the United Nations.
   The defendant has stated that his parents were killed because of
his father's alleged part in the assassination of President Kedy
and South Vietnamese leader Ngo Dinh Diem.
   Neither prosecutors nor defense attorneys have turned up any
evidence to support Khiem's assertions, and his attorneys argued
that his grandiose claims and the finding of the court psychiatrist
were reason enough to declare him unfit for trial.
   Ugast had ruled in November that the defendant should stand
trial but be evaluated throughout the legal proceedings to make
certain he could assist his attorneys in preparing his defense.
   Madame Nhu was first lady of Vietnam for her bachelor
brother-in-law Diem, and has lived in exile near Rome since the
U.S.-backed coup that resulted in the killing of Diem and her
husband Ngo Dinh Nhu in 1963.
   She was known as the dragon lady because of her harsh attitude
toward the Buddhists in her country. Her parents resigned their
diplomatic positions to protest that attitude.

   Gov. Evan Mecham, facing senators' hostile
questions at his impeachment trial, said Friday he believes the
state's top lawman is guilty of leading a mutiny against him.
   Mecham said he wishes he had fired Department of Public Safety
Director Ralph Milstead, who has accused Mecham of obstructing
justice.
   ``I wish I had done that because we wouldn't be sitting in this
body today,'' he said. ``I have highly repented that.''
   ``Do you feel Director Milstead is guilty of mutinous service,
yes or no?'' asked Sen. Tony West, a Republican like Mecham.
   ``Yes, I do, sir,'' said Mecham who had previously hedged on
answering the question.
   West noted that in the military, mutiny is punishable by death.
   ``I wouldn't propose we take Director Milstead out and shoot
him,'' said the governor. ``I would protect him against that.''
   But Mecham angrily blamed Milstead and others for his current
predicament.
   Pressed on why he didn't fire Milstead, he said, ``I had a war
going on with the attorney general and I didn't need any others.''
Milstead had been been appointed by Mecham's Democratic
predecessor, Bruce Babbitt, and under state law could be removed by
Mecham only for good cause.
   Milstead, who is out of the country, previously testified during
the trial that Mecham told him not to cooperate with Attorney
General Bob Corbin's investigation of an alleged death threat
against former Mecham aide Donna Carlson. She was a grand jury
witness in an investigation of Mecham's campaign finances.
   Mecham acknowledged some details of his much-quoted conversation
with Milstead, but said he still thinks the death threat allegation
was ``a bunch of hot air.'' He also said, ``We have really worked
to make a mountain out of molehill.''
   The obstruction of justice claim is the first of three broad
charges against Mecham being considered by the Arizona Senate. He
also is charged with concealing a $350,000 campaign loan and with
misusing $80,000 from a governor's protocol fund by lending it to
his auto dealership.
   It would take a two-thirds vote of the 30-member Senate to
convict Mecham and remove him from office. The Senate could then
take another vote and forbid him from ever holding state office
again.
   Mecham also faces a criminal trial April 21 on the charge that
he concealed the $350,000 loan and a recall election May 17.
   The 63-year-old first-term governor, who had a jaunty demeanor
in his first two days on the stand, appeared weary and defensive as
his third day of questioning ground on.
   ``You have missed the total point!'' he snapped at one senator.
   When another senator accused Mecham of keeping an enemies' list,
the governor shot back, ``I don't need a list.''
   Mecham lashed out at those who had testified against him. He
accused Milstead of misusing state vehicles and office help and of
living out of wedlock with a woman, ``which is against the law in
Arizona.''
   He accused DPS Lt. Beau Johnson of stealing an important report
from his desk and indirectly leaking it to the news media, and he
accused Ms. Carlson of taking things from his desk. Johnson
formerly headed Mecham's DPS security detail, while Ms. Carlson was
his legislative liaison.
   He said he was not paranoid but ``realistic'' in believing that
Corbin, also a Republican, was trying to mortally wound him
politically. He also accused newspapers and ``others who hold high
positions'' of working against him.
   Corbin, contacted later, said he had no comment.
   When questioned about the alleged death threat on Ms. Carlson,
the governor continued to plead ignorance of the details. ``I knew
nothing of a death threat. I knew nothing of a serious nature,'' he
said.
   Democratic Sen. Carolyn Walker pressed Mecham on his state of
mind on Nov. 15, when he told Milstead he should not cooperate with
the attorney general's probe.
   ``Is it fair to say you put your political career ahead of the
good of the people of Arizona?'' the senator asked.
   ``Certainly not,'' said Mecham.

<HEAD>With AM-Aliens-Amnesty Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Effective implementation of the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service's amnesty program for
illegal aliens depends on a ``vigorous public outreach and public
education campaign,'' according to an American Bar Association
report released Friday.
   The report, issued by the ABA's National Executive Forum on the
Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, said it is imperative
to find ways to reach eligible aliens, inform them and encourage
them to participate before the program ends.
   The legalization program was developed to provide amnesty to an
estimated 2 million undocumented workers. It is open to those
aliens who lived illegally in the United States before Jan.1, 1982,
and to agricultural workers who can show they lived in this country
for at least 90 days in the year ended May 1, 1986.
   The ABA report, the result of a two-day conference funded by the
Gannett Foundation, also recommended that the INS allow applicants
to file a ``short form'' legalization application and adjust its
interpretation of regulations to make the program available to the
maximum number of aliens.
   For those 1.3 million aliens who have already applied, the
report stressed the need for letting them know what to do to obtain
permanent status.
   The statute requires that after an 18-month period, the
applicant must demonstrate a ``minimal understanding of ordinary
English and a knowledge of U.S. history and government'' or make
satisfactory progress in courses of study to that end. Failure to
do so would result in loss of permanent status.

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and Jesse
Jackson appear to be far ahead of their rivals among likely New
York Democratic primary voters, according to poll results released
Friday.
   With a month to go before the delegate-rich New York primary,
the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion reported that 37
percent of the 459 likely Democratic voters surveyed preferred
Dukakis while 28 percent said they would vote for Jackson. The
poll's margin of error was plus or minus 5 percent.
   The remaining Democrats trailed far behind with Tennessee Sen.
Albert Gore Jr. at 5 percent, Illinois Sen. Paul Simon at 4 percent
and Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt at 3 percent. Almost 13 percent
of those surveyed were undecided.
   The final 10 percent opted for an uncommitted line that will
appear on the primary ballot. That line is the product of an effort
by elected Democratic county clerks, many of whom said they would
like New York Gov. Mario Cuomo to run for president.

   The Iran-Contra affair shouldn't pose a
problem for George Bush's candidacy because voters are not
interested in the issue, former Sen. John Tower said Friday.
   ``I fully expect the opposition to use it on him, but I don't
think it's going to have a major impact. I think the electorate
will tend to focus on the problems of the moment,'' said Tower, who
served as chairman of President Reagan's special panel that
investigated the Iran-Contra affair.
   The issue ``has already been used in the campaign'' by Bush's
opponents for the GOP nomination, Tower said, but it has ``fallen a
little bit flat.''
   ``Admittedly that's among Republicans, who are probably a little
tired of it anyway because of the embarrassment to the Republican
administration,'' Tower added. ``They don't like to hear it brought

   Supporters of presidential candidate Pat
Robertson say they have won nearly half the seats on the Louisiana
Republican State Central Committee and on Saturday intend to elect
a pro-Robertson candidate as state Republican chairman.
   ``We elected 45 Robertson supporters ... and we have 20
sympathizers on the committee already so we feel we have close to
65 of the 140 votes from the start,'' said John Rodeno, a
coordinator for Robertson's campaign.
   Robertson's near majority on the central committee was the
result of a well-orchestrated strategy. Prompted by a direct mail
and telephone campaign, Robertson forces made a point of marking
ballots for state central committee posts during last week's Super
Tuesday primaries.
   Most of Louisiana's other Republican voters chose only
presidential candidates at the polls that day.
   The central committee members will meet Saturday in Baton Rouge
where a Robertson candidate for state chairman, David Thibodaux,
faces GOP mainstay William Nungesser Sr.

   The Panamanian government declared a
national ``state of urgency'' Friday that gives it the power to
suspend individual freedoms.
   A decree said the action was taken because of ``a real situaion
of undeclared war against the republic of Panama'' by the United
States and the domestic political opposition.
   The decree did not specify what measures would be taken and said
only that ``the executive branch will adopt the measures adequate
for the preservation of public order to repell the domestic and
foreign attacks on the national economy and to face the state of
urgency throughout the country.''
   It said that for the past several weeks, ``Panama has been the
object of an attack on its economy by the United States of America
in coordination with national political sectors desperate to take
over the government by force.''
   The situation, it said, affects the ``structure of national
life.''
   The decree was based on Article 51 of the Panamanian
Constitution which gives the government the power to suspend
``temporarily, partially or totally individual rights and
liberties'' in cases of war or internal disturbances affecting
peace and public order.

   The Panamanian government declared a
national ``state of urgency'' today that gives it the power to
suspend individual freedoms.
   A decree said the action was taken because of ``a real situaion
of undeclared war against the republic of Panama'' by the United
States and the domestic political opposition. The decree did not
specify what measures would be taken.
   The nation's military strongman, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
also dismissed a colonel in charge of military intelligence and
four other officers in an apparent purge following a coup attempt.
   Meanwhile, unpaid dockworkers at the Balboa Port at the mouth of
the Panama Canal in Panama City defied an army takeover of the
facility, blocking its entrance with large shipping containers.
   Four American military police officers were arrested Thursday
while they were on duty and released after about eight hours, the
Pentagon said today.
   The government-owned newspaper Critica said the soldiers were
arrested near the University of Panama and were carrying handguns,
maps of the city and ``other military implements.''
   The paper identified them as Danny H. Feltro, William Jerry,
Virts Richard and Tammy Markley, but did not provide hometowns. The
Pentagon said it could not immediately confirm the identities.
   Among those forcibly retired by the Panama Defense Forces was
Col. Bernardo Barrera, who had been in charge of intelligence for
the 15,000-member military organization, which combines Panama's
army, navy, police and air force. Noriega derives his power from
the Defense Forces, which he heads.
   The others were identified by the military press office as Maj.
Juan Oberto, Maj. Pablo Pinto and Maj. Jose Williams and Capt.
Orlando Iguez. Their units and positions were not disclosed.
   No reason was given for their dismissal, but the action came
only two days after troops loyal to Noriega foiled an attempted
coup by what was said to be between eight and nine junior officers
led by the nation's police chief, Col. Leonidas Macias.
   Macias and four other officers were arrested during an attempted
takeover of the Defense Forces headquarters in Panama City early
Wednesday. They are being held, but no charges have been announced.
   At the Balboa port, about 300 dockworkers said they were
awaiting the arrival of soldiers, who were ordered to take over the
facility Thursday by the nation's civilian head of state, Manuel
Solis Palma.
   By decree, he also ordered the military to take over the
nation's state-owned electric, water and telephone companies,
airports, and the ministries of education, health and finance, all
of which had been struck by workers demanding their salaries.
   ``The port is shut down,'' said one dockworker at the union hall
at the entrance of the facility, about a mile from the Miraflores
Locks of the Panama Canal, the first set of three locks for ships
entering the canal from the Pacific.
   Meanwhile, opposition leaders expressed dismay that widespread
protests have been unable to remove Noriega, and many now openly
say only a U.S. military intervention can do so.
   ``It is something we, as Panamanians, do not want to see, but
the legal conditions for military intervention exist,'' said a
leader of an opposition party. Like others interviewed, he spoke on
condition he not be identified.
   The Civic Crusade, a broad anti-government coalition, had
planned demonstrations Thursday but the sight of hundreds of
soldiers carrying automatic rifles and tear gas canisters through
the streets of the capital apparently discouraged them.
   The Trans-Panama pipeline carrying Alaska oil across the isthmus
en route to Gulf Coast markets resumed operations today, a
spokesman for the pipeline said. It had stopped because of
electrical outages Wednesday and Thursday.
   ``Service was restored at 6 a.m. (EST) this morning,'' he said.
``We actually never stopped loading and unloading at both ends. We
stopped the actual pumping from one end to the other because for
that we depend on public energy. But we have our own plant at each
end for loading and unloading.''
   Workers were on strike because the cash-starved government,
under economic pressure by the United States, was unable to pay
them.
   Some shops opened in downtown Panama City Thursday but banks,
which shut their doors March 4, remained closed.
   Talk of possible U.S. intervention stems from politicians'
frustration in a country used to strong military governments that
give opposition parties little room to maneuver.
   ``I guess right now a large majority of Panamanians would
welcome a U.S. military intervention,'' said the leader of another
large opposition party. ``But three months later everybody would be
saying, `Yankee, go home.'
   ``We are just desperate for a change in the situation,'' he
added.
   On Feb. 25, a day after Noriega was indicted by federal grand
juries in Florida on drug trafficking and money laundering charges,
President Eric Arturo Delvalle tried to fire the general.
   The next day, Noriega had the National Legislative Assembly,
which he controls, vote Delvalle out of office. The United States
continues to recognize Delvalle, who is in hiding, as Panama's
legitimate president.

<HEAD>Working Air Force Wives Won't Hinder Husbands' Careers, Service
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force adopted a policy Friday that
decisions by military wives to work outside the home are none of
the service's business.
   If the spouse of a serviceman chooses to work instead of
volunteering to help with local Air Force base activites and
charities, that decision ``is a private matter'' and cannot be used
in judging the serviceman's qualifications for promotion, the new
policy states.
   The policy change was recommended by a special task force that
was created last September, shortly before an internal
investigation concluded two wives of senior officers at Grissom
AFB, Ind., had been pressured to quit their outside jobs with
warnings the careers of their husbands would suffer if they didn't.
   That investigation also found that while pressure had been
brought to bear on the wives, the commanding officers were not
guilty of any misconduct because the Air Force didn't have a
written policy on the matter at the time.
   In its new policy statement Friday, the Air Force said: ``No
commander, supervisor or other Air Force official will directly or
indirectly impede or otherwise interfere with this decision (by the
spouse).
   ``Neither the decision of the spouse in this matter, nor the
marital status of the military member, will be a factor used to
affect the evaluation, promotion or assignment of the military
member.''
   The policy statement was signed by Air Force Secretary Edward C.
Aldridge and Gen. Larry D. Welch, the service's chief of staff, who
had created the seven-member task force of Air Force military and
civilian officials.
   That panel, in a 21-page report released Friday, described
promulgation of the new policy as essential but also warned of
widespread skepticism that it would have any effect.
   ``The common belief (within the Air Force) was that the
`two-for-one' policy is currently operative, and that spouse
participation would continue to be a major factor in promotion and
selection for command.''
   The ``two-for-one'' policy is shorthand for the expectation that
the wife of a serviceman will forgo career aspirations of her own
in order to support her husband's career.
   The task force said the days of unmarried servicemen were long
gone _ ``64 percent of the Air Force's members have family
responsibilities'' _ and that ``societal changes'' were having a
substantial impact.
   ``Subtle changes in the nation's family structure have created a
dichotomy for the Air Force spouse _ accommodate the needs and
aspirations of the individual family, while meeting the needs of
the broader family, the Air Force community.''
   Senior commanders schooled in the old ways might not like it,
the panel continued, but military spouses increasingly resent the
``institutionalized'' pressure on them to support military careers
through volunteer work.
   And, the panel continued, they particularly resent a dual
standard that has now become starkly clear _ ``it is all right for
the husband of a military woman to work in the civilian community,
but if the wife of a military man works, she is often perceived as
shirking her responsibilities to the Air Force family.''
   ``This conflict between the old and the new results in
significant consequences. It reduces participation, erodes morale,
impacts retention and limits creative leadership.''
   Besides recommending a new, enforceable policy statement, the
panel urged Welch and Aldridge to establish a ``professional
volunteer management program'' to recruit and recognize military
spouses who wish to perform volunteer work, while using Air Force
Family Support Centers to help those spouses who preferred to seek
jobs.

<HEAD>New Contra Aid Package Proposed, More Honduran Assistance
Discussed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bipartisan group of senators proposed a $48
million package of new aid to Nicaragua's Contra rebels Friday,
including renewed authority for the CIA to deliver previously
stockpiled weapons.
   As U.S. troops continued to arrive in Honduras in a show of
force, Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams said additional
assistance was being discussed with Honduran President Jose Azcona,
in response to a reported Nicaraguan incursion.
   White House chief of staff Howard Baker said President Reagan
would give ``most careful'' consideration to any request from
Honduras for troops to help repel Nicaraguan forces, although he
reiterated that U.S. troops were not expected to be involved in any
military operation in the region.
   One of the Senate's leading peace advocates, Sen. Mark O.
Hatfield, said the sending of U.S. troops amounted merely to
``matching stupidity with stupidity'' and introduced legislation
barring the troops from a combat role without permission from
Congress.
   Sponsors of the new Contra aid proposal said they hoped it would
revive negotiations in Congress and with the Reagan administration
on an aid package that could be quickly enacted to replace supplies
lost or expended during the past week's heavy fighting along the
Nicaraguan-Honduran border.
   But the extent of the damage inflicted on the rebels by the
Sandinista incursion remained unclear. Sen. David Boren, D-Okla.,
chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the Nicaraguan
troops were withdrawing without accomplishing all their objectives.
   ``We think it's very important right now to send a signal to the
Sandinista government'' which allegedly crossed the border into
Honduras in an effort to destroy rebel camps and supplies, Boren
said.
   Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., said announcement of the package
also would strengthen the Contras as they enter direct cease-fire
talks with the Managua regime, scheduled for Monday. ``This is a
common-sense, moderate and reasoned approach,'' she said.
   The proposal would use $48 million in unspent Pentagon money to
buy food, clothing, shelter and medical supplies, and to transport
it to troops in the field, over the next year. About $3 million of
that amount would go for communications gear.
   But in what promised to be a controversial provision, the
package would allow the CIA to airdrop ammunition and weapons
previously stockpiled by the rebels to troops in the field. Boren
said the rebels still have $2 million to $5 million worth of
undelivered supplies, about half of them lethal.
   And it would give President Reagan the right to hold a quick,
guaranteed vote in Congress on any request for further military aid
under certain conditions if the peace talks between the Sandinistas
and Contras break down.
   As a ``carrot,'' the bill also would promise long-term economic
aid for the region once political stability is restored.
   Sen. Daniel Evans, R-Wash., who has opposed Contra aid in the
past, said he was supporting the latest proposal because it ``is
the best way to ensure that (the peace talks) have some chance of
success.''
   Action on further aid for the rebels has been stalled since
March 3, when the House narrowly rejected a $30 million package of
purely humanitarian aid. Aid proponents saw the Sandinista
incursion into Honduras as a new opportunity to revive interest in
aid.
   Meanwhile, Abrams told reporters that American officials have
been discussing with Honduran President Azcona the possibility of
providing additional assistance to that country, in addition to the
3,200 troops already airlifted to Palmerola Air Base near
Tegucigalpa.
   ``There are some other possibilities that we've discussed,''
Abrams said, adding that the possibilities did not include
additional troops. ``We do not have a formal request from President
Azcona as of this morning for any other form of assistance.
Obviously, if we get one we'll take it very seriously.''
   Baker said that if a request were received from Honduras for
troops to help repel Nicaraguan forces, ``it would be most
carefully considered and most deliberately considered. But I cannot
tell you what decision the president would make under those
circumstances.''
   Baker, interviewed on the syndicated television program, ``John
McLaughlin's One on One,'' was asked at what point U.S. troops
would enter action.
   ``I don't anticipate that will occur at all. I think that the
Honduran forces can handle that on their own, and I fully
anticipate that either the Nicaraguans will retire on their own or
Honduras will, as they say, encourage them to do that. But I do not
expect American troops to be involved in any military operation
there,'' he said.
   Hatfield's proposal would permit U.S. military exercises in
Honduras, like the training mission which began Thursday, only if
Congress has been notified a month in advance. Troops could not be
sent into combat without a declaration of war or a ``clear and
present danger'' of attack on the United States or its citizens. It
also would prohibit any increase in the permanent U.S. military
presence there.
   He said the administration's action amounted to ``sinking to the
level of those in Nicaragua who have no interest in peace.''
   ``Under the terms of this legislation we will not allow and will
not tolerate sending American military personnel into combat in
Central America,'' Hatfield said. ``It is not an option... We will
not permit our young people to be used as pawns in this political
game. And we will not push them down the slippery slope of
intervention as we pushed their fathers and brothers down that
slope into Vietnam.''

<HEAD>GM Announces New Steering Wheel That Moves With Driver On Impact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors President Robert Stempel on Friday
introduced a new car steering wheel designed to move with the
driver on impact and reduce injury in car crashes.
   Stempel told a conference of 1,000 road safety activists that
the steering wheel remains ``a primary source of injury in the
event of a crash,'' despite the collapsible steering column
developed 20 years ago.
   The new steering wheel has an energy-absorbing hub, the point
where the wheel meets the steering column. At this juncture in the
new wheel, six metal joints are designed to fold on impact and
enable the wheel to move parallel to the driver's chest. This
allows the wheel to rest against the body and move with it.
   ``That helps spread the force of the impact and reduces chest
injuries,'' Stempel said.
   Tests showed the new steering wheel also lessened injuries to
the abdomen and the face when those were the points of impact, he
said.
   The new wheel will make its debut next year in the Chevrolet
Cavalier and will be phased in on other models not equipped with
air bags.
   Stempel used the occasion to encourage the wearing of seatbelts,
especially in Massachusetts where a seatbelt law was repealed.
Thirty-two states require motorists to wear seatbelts.
   He also urged motorists to pay better attention to pedestrians
and motorcyclists, who comprise one quarter of the annual road
death toll.
   The three-day national conference, called Lifesavers, is the
sixth annual meeting of safety experts, state and city officials,
car makers and dealers, and representatives from the insurance
industry and law enforcement.

   Lt. Col. Oliver North, the fired national
security aide facing trial in the Iran-Contra affair, announced
Friday he has asked to retire from the Marine Corps and said he may
subpoena ``the highest-ranking officials in our government'' as
part of his defense.
   North submitted his request on Thursday, asking that he be
allowed to retire effective May 1 when he will have completed 20
years of active military service, Pentagon sources said.
   That is the minimum amount of service required to retire with a
pension. With 20 years of service, North is entitled to a pension
totaling 50 percent of his base monthly pay, or slightly over
$22,000 a year.
   In a statement read in the office of his attorney, Brendan
Sullivan, North said the lawyer ``has informed me that the defense
against these charges may require him to issue subpoenas for the
testimony and records of the highest ranking officials in our
government.''
   ``That strikes me as a course of action incompatible with my
continued service as a Marine officer,'' he continued.
``Accordingly, with great sadness, I have tendered my request to
retire from the Marine Corps.''
   North, who wopre a civilian busines suit in place of his usual
ribbon-bedecked Marine uniform, refused an answer questions after
reading the statement.
   According to one official, who agreed to discuss the matter only
if not identified, North has available a substantial amount of
accumulated leave and probably will stop working as a staff officer
at Marine Corps headquarters pending his retirement.
   North was reassigned to headquarters in November 1986 after
President Reagan fired him as an aide to the National Security
Council.
   The sources said there was nothing to block approval of North's
retirement request.
   They noted that Rear Adm. John Poindexter, North's former boss
and Reagan's former national security adviser, exercised his right
to retire from the Navy late last year.
   North, Poindexter and two others were indicted by a federal
grand jury Wednesday on charges they conspired to divert Iranian
arms sales profits to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   The 23-count indictment, which also named retired Air Force Maj.
Gen. Richard V. Secord and his business partner, Albert Hakim, said
the defendants organized, directed and concealed ``a program to
continue funding of and logistical and other support for military
and paramilitary operations in Nicaragua by the Contras'' at a time
U.S. law barred such action.
   North vowed after the indictment was returned to fight the
charges, declaring: ``I did not commit any crime.''
   North, a much-decorated combat veteran of Vietnam and graduate
of the U.S. Naval Academy, testified last year before Congress that
he always believed he had the approval of his superiors to take the
actions he did.
   Poindexter, during his testimony before Congress, said he never
informed the president of his decision to divert arms sale profits.
   The 44-year-old North is currently drawing a base pay of
$3,693.60 per month. Under military retirement rules, he will be
entitled to half that _ or slightly more than $22,000 a year.
   According to one source, North was technically required to
provide the Marine Corps with four months' advance notice before
retiring. The service is unlikely to balk, however, at granting him
a waiver of that advance-notice requirement, the source added.
   One Pentagon official said Gen. Alfred M. Gray, the Marine Corps
commandant, had already approved North's request and that it was
now awaiting only the approval of the Navy secretary's office.
   ``And that should come on Monday,'' said the source. ``This is
all very routine.''
   According to the Defense Department, the pension rights of North
and Poindexter are unlikely to be affected by the outcome of the
legal cases against them since both men served honorably for at
least 20 years.
   ``Generally speaking, a conviction does not affect eligibility
for a military pension,'' said Col. David Shea, a Pentagon
spokesman.

   Morton Thiokol officials said Thursday that
if five employees killed in fire while loading an MX missile motor
with fuel had followed company policy, they would be alive today.
   They said the crew ignored strict company rules and entered the
building during a phase of the operation that should have been
handled by remote control from a bunker a quarter of a mile away.
   ``We don't know why the people were in the building. By
procedure, they should not have been there. We have not been able
to come up with a reason ... we just don't know,'' said Robert
Lindstrom, a former NASA executive who directed Thiokol's internal
investigation of the Dec. 29 fire.
   However, in response to a question, Lindstrom said it was
possible that the crew had complied with procedures.
   Lindstrom said the company's probe resulted in the same
conclusion reached by an Air Force investigation, namely that the
explosive fire which burned 100,000 pounds of solid propellant and
destroyed the building was ignited by either a spark of static
electricity or heat from friction.
   The Air Force conclusions were expected to be released shortly.
   On Wednesday, the Utah Division of Occupational Safety and
Health cited the defense contractor for six safety violations and
imposed a $31,700 fine. The victims' presence in the building and
failure to use remote-control equipment were among the most serious
violations alleged by the agency, which characterized three of them
as willful and serious.
   Phillip R. Dykstra, vice president of strategic operations for
Morton Thiokol, said the state's contention that management knew
that crews occasionally were present during restricted operations
was not supported by facts.
   ``It's not true,'' Dykstra said. ``Our investigation shows no
one was aware that occasionally (procedures) had been violated..''
   Lindstrom said that during interviews with numerous employees,
one or two said crews had gone into buildings in violation of
safety rules. He said investigators did not pursue that issue
because their charge was only to find the cause of the fire.
   Dykstra contested UOSH's classification of the three violations
as willful, although the facts supporting the citations were true.
He said the company ``will avail itself of every legal avenue to
challenge these citations,'' a procedure which involves appeal to
the independent Utah UOSH Review Commission.
   The workers were withdrawing the core from a casting of the
first stage of an MX missile when the solid fuel ignited. The blaze
caused $6.2 million in damage to the building at the company's
Wasatch Operations plant 25 miles west of Brigham City.
   Morton Thiokol makes the missile's four stages, and the space
shuttle's solid-fuel rocket boosters, one of which failed when the
Challenger blew up in January 1986.
   The fire has held up production of the MX missile until the
cause and corrective measures could be determined. Ed Garrison,
president of the company's aerospace group, said Morton Thiokol
hopes to reach an agreement on corrective measures with the Air
Force within two weeks.
   He said those measures include removing the Teflon-coated steel
core at a slower rate to reduce friction, verification that the
motor is properly grounded to prevent buildup of static
electricity, and installation of instruments to monitor static
electricity.
   The cores, or forms, are removed after the propellant has been
poured into the casing and allowed to harden.
   The state agency alleged that the missile motor was not properly
grounded during the operation, though Lindstrom said the previous
shift had grounded the missile correctly. Because of extensive fire
damage, it was impossible to know whether the grounding had
remained intact, he said.
   However, he said static electricity can build up even when there
is proper grounding.
   It takes up to four hours to remove the 60-inch core from the
casing. After the initial phase, in which the core is lifted about
30 inches, crews are authorized to enter the building to remove a
hydraulic lift and attach the core to a crane that completes the
procedure.
   Responding to a question, Lindstrom said it was possible the
workers had completed the first phase of their task and were in the
building to change the equipment. If so, they were following
company policy.

   Government radio condemned border air
raids by Honduras, which it said struck inside Nicaragua, and
exhorted listeners Friday against ``American imperialism and the
threat of military intervention.''
   A headline in Barricada, the Sandinista newspaper, said: ``The
Order Of The Day: Intensify Combat.''
   Honduras said the raids Thursday were confined to its own
territory, aimed at Nicaraguan soldiers it said crossed the
frontier the day before in pursuit of Contra rebels.
   The Sandinista government continued with plans for cease-fire
talks with the Contras next Monday, but the U.S.-supported rebels
were considering a boycott.
   Cease-fires in the region's civil wars, and a ban on the use of
one country's territory for attacks on another, are provisions of
the peace plan signed Aug. 7 by five Central American presidents.
   Nicaragua said it had called off its offensive to roust Contras
from camps along the Honduran border Wednesday but was maintaining
combat positions.
   Although the Defense Ministry said none of the soldiers entered
Honduras, a Nicaraguan military source indicated privately that
they had.
   Honduran officials and the Reagan administration say Sandinista
soldiers crossed the rugged, ill-defined border about 175 miles
from Managua.
   On Thursday, the United States started flying 3,200 soldiers of
the 82nd Airborne Division and 7th Light Infantry to Honduras in a
show of support. Defense Secretary said they would be on a training
exercise there for 10 days but would stay out of combat.
   President Daniel Ortega said Nicaraguan troops would take on the
Americans if necessary.
   He hedged the question of whether Nicaraguan soldiers crossed
the Coco River in the isolated northern region, as he has when
previous incursions were reported.
   ``Here the question is not if army troops penetrated Honduran
territory or not, but that we have dozens of camps of mercenary
forces in Honduran territory ... tolerated by the Honduran
government,'' he said Thursday.
   Honduran warplanes bombed the Bocay border region, where
Nicaragua's northern military headquarters is located. The Honduran
government said a Soviet-supplied Nicaraguan helicopter was
destroyed but the Defense Ministry denied the claim.
   Journalists taken to the area earlier Thursday saw and felt a
bomb explode at the confluence of the Bocay and Coco rivers. Lt.
Col. Javier Carrion, commander of the offensive against the
Contras, said two bombs fell in Nicaraguan territory and one on the
Honduran side.
   Carrion told reporters in a jungle clearing at San Andres de
Bocay that 4,500 soldiers were involved in the sweep through an
area running from central Nicaragua to the frontier. He said they
had air support from Soviet-supplied helicopter gunships and An-26
propeller-driven planes carrying bombs.
   He said Sandinista troops had killed 92 Contras and wounded 300,
at the cost of 34 soldiers dead and 68 wounded.
   The colonel said the purpose was to destroy Contra bases in the
border area, which is about 40 miles from an important mining
region the rebels attacked in December.
   Honduras said about 2,000 Nicaraguan soldiers crossed the
border, and a high-ranking military officer said about half of them
still were there Friday.

<HEAD>Black Journalists' Group Says Media Still Not Hiring Enough
Minorities</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Twenty years after the Kerner Commission accused
the news media of looking at the world ``with white men's eyes,''
newspapers and broadcast stations still are not hiring or promoting
enough blacks, a group of black journalists said Friday.
   Despite some industry attempts to improve black employment
prospects, ``what has resulted in far too many instances can simply
be characterized as a lot of motion and little movement,'' the
group's report said.
   The National Association of Black Journalists formed a panel to
compare the status of blacks in journalism today with 20 years ago,
when race riots prompted President Johnson to appoint Illinois Gov.
Otto Kerner to head the National Advisory Commission on Civil
Disorders.
   The Kerner Commission conclusion that ``the journalistic
profession has been shockingly backward in seeking out, hiring,
training and promoting'' blacks ``still rings true,'' said DeWayne
Wickham of the Gannett News Service, president of the NABJ.
   The panel, which Wickham said carried out its study over several
months, acknowledged ``substantial good will'' among news media
executives.
   But, Wickham said: ``We also found there had not been a lot of
progress. ... It would be wrong to stand here and say there has
been no progress. It would be equally wrong to say it is
significant.''
   The panel's recommendations:
   _Newspaper publishers should promise to double the number of
black journalists from 3.5 percent of newsroom employees to 7
percent by 1991.
   _Newspaper and broadcast industry foundations should deny grants
to college journalism programs ``which do not employ a single
full-time black member, or which does not undertake a serious
effort to recruit and retain black students.''
   _The National Association of Broadcasters and the
Radio-Television News Directors Association should join the NABJ to
form a task force to halt the decline in blacks working in
television news. A declining number of black men employed in
broadcast news caused the ratio of minority group members in the
field to drop from 15 percent in 1979 to 13 percent in 1986, the
panel said.
   ``Believing there is a possible relationship between the
deregulation of the broadcast industry and this sharp drop ... the
NABJ will monitor the compliance of television stations with
existing (Federal Communications Commission) regulations,'' the
report said.
   ``Where we are unsuccessful in bringing compliance through
negotiations, the NABJ will move aggressively to challenge the
licenses of broadcast stations,'' it said.
   Ernie Schultz, president of the RTNDA, said his group supported
the report's recommendations ``100 percent.''
   Wickham said copies of the report also would be sent to the NAB,
the American Society of Newspaper Editors and the American
Newspaper Publishers Association for comment.
   Dwight Ellis, NAB vice president for minority services, said,
``Blacks are losing ground in broadcasting. It's been documented.''
   He said that although the reason for the decline was unclear,
the NAB and the news editors were considering two remedies: an
advertising campaign to tell blacks about some of the less obvious
jobs available in broadcasting, and creation of an institute to
train minority group members for management.
   Lee Stinnett, executive director of the ASNE, said surveys show
that the number of minority group members employed in newspaper
newsrooms has more than doubled since 1978, rising from 1,700 to
3,600, or from 4 percent of the total to 6.5 percent, he said.
Slightly more than half the minority newspaper journalists are
black, he said.

   Federal regulators on Friday pledged to
protect all depositors and general creditors of the thrift unit of
the troubled California-based Financial Corp. of America, the
nation's second largest thrift holding company.
   The announcement by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board came after
the company's disclosure, in a report filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, that its thrift unit _ American Savings & Loan
Association of Stockton, Calif. _ was insolvent under generally
accepted accounting principles.
   The bank board's promise, designed to provide the ailing S&L
with stability and stem a drain of deposits, goes beyond its usual
mandate of protecting deposit accounts up to $100,000.
   In the statement, the bank board also reaffirmed its support for
the management of FCA and American.
   FCA, based in Irvine, Calif., said American's net worth _ the
difference between assets and liabilities _ had fallen to negative
$106 million at the end of the year, compared with positive $244.4
million on Sept. 30.
   Under less stringent regulatory accounting guidelines, its net
worth was plus $69 million at the end of 1987, compared with $357.8
million at the end of the third quarter.
   FCA had previously revealed that its net worth had fallen into
the red, but this is the first disclosure that net worth at
American, FCA's main subsidiary, has fallen below the zero mark.
That happened when American concluded that repayment of debts due
from its parent company was not assured.
   FCA's annual report, filed with the SEC, also disclosed that
American had a drain on deposits of $493 million during the first
two months of this year. It attributed the drain to publicity about
the bank's problems and said the drain eased during the first 10
days of March. Deposits had totaled $17.1 billion at the end of the
year.
   The drain was milder than the severe run at American in August
and September of 1984, when the bank _ amid heavy operating losses
_ lost about $6.8 billion of its $25 billion in deposits.
   The bank board's sister agency for commercial banks, the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp., issued a similar promise on Thursday
protecting all depositors and general creditors of First
RepublicBank Corp. of Dallas, a bank holding company of about the
same size as FCA.
   However, the FDIC went a step further than the bank board by
pumping $1 billion into First RepublicBank.
   FCA on Feb. 23 asked the bank board for a $1.5 billion in
assistance as soon as possible. Karl Hoyle, a bank board spokesman,
said the request is under review.
   FCA, with $33.7 billion in assets, ranks second among thrift
companies only to H.F. Ahmanson & Co., the Los Angeles-based parent
of Home Savings of America.
   The bank board has tried unsuccessfully for nearly a year to
find another institution willing to take over all or part of FCA on
terms that wouldn't be too costly to the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp., the bank board unit that insures deposits.
   On-again, off-again talks with the thrift unit of Ford Motor Co.
broke down early in January.
   Because of its size, FCA is the bank board's largest single
problem institution, although the problems collectively of Texas
S&Ls are more severe.
   On Jan. 27, FCA reported a loss of $224.6 million in the last
three months of last year, bringing its 1987 loss to $468 million.
   Two weeks later, the bank board ordered it to sell off $2.5
billion in mortgage-backed securities to reduce its vulnerablity to
interest rate fluctuations.
   On March 9, the bank board, which regulates about 3,150 S&Ls
nationally, passed a resolution reassuring nervous Wall Street
firms, which had loaned more than $12 billion to American in the
form of reverse repurchase agreements.

   Four American military police officers were
arrested by Panamanian authorities on Thursday and held in custody
for about 8{ hours, during which time they were ``verbally abused
and made to stand for long periods of time,'' the Pentagon said
Friday.
   The Defense Department said the four MPs were on ``official
duty'' at the time of their arrest in strife-torn Panama City and
were arrested without cause and held incognito.
   They were released late Thursday night, but Panamanian
authorities continued Friday to hold their cars, sidearms and flak
jackets, the Pentagon added.
   ``Three members of the U.S. Army South's Military Police Command
and one member of the Oklahoma National Guard were arrested at
approximately 2:30 p.m. Thursday while on official business in the
vicinity of the Hilton Park Hotel in Panama City,'' the Defense
Department said in a statement.
   ``The four were detained at Panama Defense Forces facilities for
several hours before being released into the custody of U.S.
military authorities at approximately 11 p.m. The soldiers were in
civilian clothes and were checking on the security of U.S. military
families in government-leased quarters in the area who are affected
by the lack of electrical, water and telephone service in parts of
Panama City.''
   The government of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, meanwhile,
declared a national ``state of urgency'' Friday that allows it to
suspend individual freedoms. A decree said the action was taken
because of ``a real situaion of undeclared war against the republic
of Panama'' by the United States and the domestic political
opposition.
   Capt. Nancy LaLuntas, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said the one
National Guardsman was a member of the 745th MP Company who was on
annual training in Panama with the U.S. Army South.
   The spokeswoman added the four were authorized to carry weapons
beneath their civilian clothes and were carrying credentials that
should have been honored. Under the terms of the Panama Canal
Treaty, U.S. military authorities also should have been notified of
the MPs' arrest, she said.
   ``U.S. military authorities were not notified of the arrest by
Panama Defense Forces,'' LaLuntas said. ``And during their 8{ hours
of being detained, the arrested soldiers asked repeatedly for
permission to notify U.S. military authorities of their situation,
and their requests were denied.
   ``The soldiers were also verbally abused (and) made to stand for
long periods of time...,'' she said.
   The Pentagon identified the four as Pvt. 1st Class Tammy
Markley; Pvt. 1st Class Richard Virts; Specialist 4 Jerry Williams,
and Staff Sgt. Danny Felton, the National Guardsman. The ages and
hometowns of the four were not available.
   The Pentagon statement was issued following a report in a
Panamanian newspaper Friday. The newspaper Critica said the four
Americans were arrested ``in an area where daily activities
disturbing the public order'' had taken place.
   It said the four were carrying handguns, maps of the city and
``other military implements.''
   Panama was hit by power outages this week as electric company
workers joined continuing protests against the government of
military ruler Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   On Wednesday the U.S. Southern Command placed the 10,000
American troops and their dependents stationed in Panama on the
highest alert status when Panama's police chief, Col. Leonidas
Macias, led an unsuccessful coup attempt against Noriega.

   A 19-member U.S. delegation selected by
President Reagan is heading to El Salvador this weekend to monitor
legislative and municipal elections that leftist guerrillas have
threatened to disrupt with violence, officials said Friday.
   ``The president strongly supports the people of El Salvador and
their democratic aspirations and is demonstrating this support by
sending this delegation,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said.
   A delegation member, Rep. John G. Rowland, R-Conn., said, ``Our
presence there is mainly one to deter any fraud (by the
participating political parties) and to objectively and fairly
report what we see happening.''
   Andy Fisher, an aide to Sen. Richard G. Lugar, R-Ind., said the
delegation will visit polling places in San Salvador and the
countryside despite the pinpointing of the polls as military
targets by the leftist forces.
   The delegation, headed by Lugar and Rep. John P. Murtha, D-Pa.,
was scheduled to leave Andrews Air Force Base Saturday morning and
return late Sunday night or early Monday morning.
   The U.S.-backed Salvadoran government of President Jose Napoleon
Duarte is holding elections Sunday for mayors and councils in the
country's 262 municipalities and for all 60 seats in the
Legislative Assembly.
   Leftist groups have vowed to obstruct road transportation during
the elections to disrupt voting, and said polling places will be
``military objectives.'' The rebels maintain that peace must be
achieved before any election is held.
   The main electoral opposition to the ruling Christian Democratic
Party is Arena, a rightist group.
   ``This particular election is a test for democracy, not only
because of the hazards proposed by the rebels, but perhaps because
many citizens of El Salvador, after five elections, have lost some
of their enthusiasm for democracy,'' Lugar said in a statement.
   The delegation will be briefed by State Department officials in
San Salvador before monitoring the elections.
   Additional members of Congress in the delegation are Sen.
Christopher Bond, R-Mo.; Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla.; Rep. John
Kasich, R-Ohio; Rep. Beverly Byron, D-Md.; and Rep. Alan Mollohan,
D-W. Va.
   Other members of the delegation are Howard Penniman, an
elections expert with the American Enterprise Institute; Mario
Paredes, executive director of the Northwest Regional Center for
Hispanics in New York; Merom Brachman, retired chairman of the Ohio
Ethics Commission;
   Eugenia Kemble, executive director of the Free Trade Union
Institute; Susan Kaufman-Purcell, Council on Foreign Relations, New
York; John White, former Democratic national chairman; Devier
Pierson of Pierson Semmes and Finley, a Washington law firm;
   James Dyer, deputy assistant to the president; Edwin G. Corr,
U.S. ambassador to El Salvador; Fritz Korth, International
Foundation for Electoral Systems, an advisory member; and Betsy
Warren, principal deputy assistant secretary of state for
legislation.

   Here is a transcript of the announcement
Friday by Lt. Col. Oliver North, who is facing trial in the
Iran-Contra case, on his request to retire from the Marine Corps.
   There have been many inquiries this afternoon regarding a story,
apparently out of the Pentagon, about my status in the Marine Corps.
   And I would like to clarify the situation at this time.
   I love the United States Marine Corps, and the courageous
brothers in arms that I have served with over the past 20 years.
   Since graduating from the United States Naval Academy, my goal
has simply been to serve our country as a Marine for as long as
possible.
   Unfortunately, the indictment delivered two days ago places me
in a situation where my continued service would be inconsistent
with preparing and presenting a vigorous defense against these
unfounded charges.
   My attorney, Brendan Sullivan, has informed me that the defense
against these charges may require him to issue subpoenas for the
testimony and records of the highest-ranking officials of our
government.
   That strikes me as a course of action incompatible with my
continued service as a Marine officer.
   Accordingly, with great sadness, I have tendered my request to
retire from the Marine Corps.
   For over 16 months, I have silently endured a torrent of media
speculation, as the largest investigation in the history of our
country has probed every aspect of my personal and professional
life, and that of my family.
   I have not responded, except when required by law during the
course of the congressional hearings last summer.
   Further silence is a disservice to me, my family, and the brave
people I have served and worked with on matters of great importance
to our country.
   Moreover, while on active duty, I am not fully free to speak out
or to take other actions which may be necessary.
   The months ahead will be difficult, and I recognize that
fighting a prosecutor with an unlimited budget, an enormous staff,
is a formidable and costly task for me and my counsel.
   My family and I continue to take heart from the overwhelming
expressions of love and concern and encouragement by countless
freedom-loving people.
   We are extremely grateful.
   Your prayers and support have helped us to endure this ordeal in
Washington.
   I thank you.
   God bless you.
   Semper fidelis.
   Thank you.

<TEXT>
   Museum curators, history buffs and urban
cowboys bought up the biggest collection of William F. ``Buffalo
Bill'' Cody memorabilia ever auctioned Friday, including a
silver-trimmed rifle that brought $22,500.
   The collection, sold at Butterfield & Butterfield, consisted of
more than 300 items originally preserved by Cody's sister, Julia
Cody Goodman.
   A pair of chaps worn by the Pony Express rider, Indian fighter,
buffalo hunter, Army scout and showman sold for $1,400, and a rope
lariat went for $500.
   A silver-handled Plains rifle fetched $22,500. Other items
included Cody's buffalo-hide coat and his silver-handled toothbrush.
   ``Who better symbolizes the American West than Buffalo Bill?''
asked R.L. Wilson, historical consultant to Colt Firearms Co. of
Hartford, Conn. He came to bid on a single-action Colt revolver,
one of eight guns in the collection.
   The collection was sold by Greg Martin, a San Francisco gun
collector and history buff who bought the artifacts for $300,000
last year in Billings, Mont. He had wanted to buy only a shotgun
inscribed to Cody, but had to buy the whole lot to get the shotgun
from the elderly owner.
   Rival bidders eyeing each other across the auction floor
included curator Paul Fees of the Buffalo Bill Museum in Cody,
Wyo., and Thomas B. Morrison of the Buffalo Bill Ranch Historic
Park in North Platte, Neb.
   They vied for a collection of letters to Cody's sister
discussing his marriage, the death of his son and other intimate
events.
   ``We are interested in the correspondence because it is so
revealing and personal,'' said Fees. ``We have a strong
biographical interest.''
   The collection was unique for its large number of personal
items, including a tomahawk from his friend D.F. ``White Beaver''
Powell and dozens of photographs, show bills and theater tickets
chronicling Cody's life as the roughrider who along with shooting
champion W. ``Doc'' Carver founded the first Wild West Show.
   Carl Otis, owner of Pawnee Bill's Wild West Exposition
Re-enacted, a Northern California traveling show, dressed in white
Stetson hat and buckskin jacket for the occasion. He bid $3,000 on
a Smith & Wesson ivory-handled revolver used in Cody's Wild West
Show but the gun went for $9,000.
   Private collector George Kramer, a New Jersey real estate
developer, hoped to buy Cody's silver riding bit for his
80-year-old father, who still rides. But he bid first on Cody's
Winchester rifle, inscribed and hand-carved with buffalo.
   ``That's the one item I wanted most,'' said Kramer, who
successfully bid $11,000 for it.

   A bipartisan group of senators proposed a $48
million package of new aid to Nicaragua's Contra rebels Friday,
including renewed authority for the CIA to deliver previously
stockpiled weapons.
   As U.S. troops continued to arrive in Honduras in a show of
force, Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams said additional
assistance was being discussed with Honduran President Jose Azcona,
in response to a reported Nicaraguan incursion.
   White House chief of staff Howard Baker said President Reagan
would give ``most careful'' consideration to any request from
Honduras for troops to help repel Nicaraguan forces, although he
reiterated that U.S. troops were not expected to be involved in any
military operation in the region.
   One of the Senate's leading peace advocates, Sen. Mark O.
Hatfield, said the sending of U.S. troops amounted merely to
``matching stupidity with stupidity'' and introduced legislation
barring the troops from a combat role without permission from
Congress.
   Sponsors of the new Contra aid proposal said they hoped it would
revive negotiations in Congress and with the Reagan administration
on an aid package that could be quickly enacted to replace supplies
lost or expended during the past week's heavy fighting along the
Nicaraguan-Honduran border.
   But the extent of the damage inflicted on the rebels by the
Sandinista incursion remained unclear. Sen. David Boren, D-Okla.,
chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the Nicaraguan
troops were withdrawing without accomplishing all their objectives.
   ``We think it's very important right now to send a signal to the
Sandinista government'' which allegedly crossed the border into
Honduras in an effort to destroy rebel camps and supplies, Boren
said.
   Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., said announcement of the package
also would strengthen the Contras as they enter direct cease-fire
talks with the Managua regime, scheduled for Monday. ``This is a
common-sense, moderate and reasoned approach,'' she said.
   The proposal would use $48 million in unspent Pentagon money to
buy food, clothing, shelter and medical supplies, and to transport
it to troops in the field, over the next year. About $3 million of
that amount would go for communications gear.
   But in what promised to be a controversial provision, the
package would allow the CIA to airdrop ammunition and weapons
previously stockpiled by the rebels to troops in the field. Boren
said the rebels still have $2 million to $5 million worth of
undelivered supplies, about half of them lethal.
   And it would give President Reagan the right to hold a quick,
guaranteed vote in Congress on any request for further military aid
under certain conditions if the peace talks between the Sandinistas
and Contras break down.
   As a ``carrot,'' the bill also would promise long-term economic
aid for the region once political stability is restored.
   An administration official, speaking on condition he not be
identified, said of the new aid package, ``We are encouraged from
reports we have heard about it, but we will have to wait until we
have the actual details.''
   Sen. Daniel Evans, R-Wash., who has opposed Contra aid in the
past, said he was supporting the latest proposal because it ``is
the best way to ensure that (the peace talks) have some chance of
success.''
   Action on further aid for the rebels has been stalled since
March 3, when the House narrowly rejected a $30 million package of
purely humanitarian aid. Aid proponents saw the Sandinista
incursion into Honduras as a new opportunity to revive interest in
aid.
   Meanwhile, Abrams told reporters that American officials have
been discussing with Honduran President Azcona the possibility of
providing additional assistance to that country, in addition to the
3,200 troops already airlifted to Palmerola Air Base near
Tegucigalpa.
   ``There are some other possibilities that we've discussed,''
Abrams said, adding that the possibilities did not include
additional troops. ``We do not have a formal request from President
Azcona as of this morning for any other form of assistance.
Obviously, if we get one we'll take it very seriously.''
   Baker said that if a request were received from Honduras for
troops to help repel Nicaraguan forces, ``it would be most
carefully considered and most deliberately considered. But I cannot
tell you what decision the president would make under those
circumstances.''
   Baker, interviewed on the syndicated television program, ``John
McLaughlin's One on One,'' was asked at what point U.S. troops
would enter action.
   ``I don't anticipate that will occur at all. I think that the
Honduran forces can handle that on their own, and I fully
anticipate that either the Nicaraguans will retire on their own or
Honduras will, as they say, encourage them to do that. But I do not
expect American troops to be involved in any military operation
there,'' he said.
   Hatfield's proposal would permit U.S. military exercises in
Honduras, like the training mission which began Thursday, only if
Congress has been notified a month in advance. Troops could not be
sent into combat without a declaration of war or a ``clear and
present danger'' of attack on the United States or its citizens. It
also would prohibit any increase in the permanent U.S. military
presence there.
   He said the administration's action amounted to ``sinking to the
level of those in Nicaragua who have no interest in peace.''
   ``Under the terms of this legislation we will not allow and will
not tolerate sending American military personnel into combat in
Central America,'' Hatfield said. ``It is not an option... We will
not permit our young people to be used as pawns in this political
game. And we will not push them down the slippery slope of
intervention as we pushed their fathers and brothers down that
slope into Vietnam.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Fund-Raisers in Firm With State Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Partners in a New York banking firm that does
business with the state of Massachusetts have given money and
helped raise more for the presidential bid of Gov. Michael Dukakis,
according to a published report Friday.
   A Dukakis campaign spokesman denied there was anything improper.
   Michael Del Giudice, general partner in Lazard Freres and Co.,
organized eight fund-raisers last June that raised $250,000 for the
Dukakis campaign, said The Boston Herald.
   And Jonathan O'Herron, a partner in the same firm, was co-host
of a fund-raising dinner, also in June, that raised $25,000, the
Herald said.
   Federal Election Commission records show Del Giudice gave the
maximum contribution of $1,000 to Dukakis, and O'Herron and his
wife each gave $500, the newspaper said.
   Lazard Freres was awarded a three-year contract Jan. 7 to advise
the state on fiscal management of construction of a third Boston
Harbor tunnel and the depression of the Central Artery.
   ``I think it's ridiculous to suggest that there is any
appearance of a conflict of interest,'' said campaign spokesman
Steve Akey. ``There is absolutely no connection between
contributions and contracts.''
   Akey said other members of the banking firm support different
candidates. And he said it would be impractical for the campaign to
refuse contributions from the thousands of individuals and
companies that do business with the state or operate under state
regulation.
   The subject of campaign finance has become a debating point
between Dukakis and a Democratic rival, Rep. Richard Gephardt of
Missouri.
   Dukakis has faulted Gephardt for taking money from political
action committees, while noting that his own campaign rejects PAC
money and contributions from registered Massachusetts lobbyists.
   Gephardt has defended his nearly $300,000 in PAC donations and
persistently raised questions about Dukakis' acceptance of
contributions from anyone doing business with the state of
Massachusetts.

   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
insisted Friday that his country remains committed to seeking peace
in the Middle East despite his rebuff of a U.S. proposal for an
international peace conference.
   Israel cannot accept the proposal offered by Secretary of State
George Shultz because such a gathering would give Arab countries
and the Soviet Union a chance to impose their will on Israel,
Shamir said.
   However, Israel remains open to direct talks with the Arabs, the
prime minister said.
   ``This approach is enshrined in the Camp David accords, to which
we remain committed,'' Shamir said, referring to the settlement his
country made with Egypt in 1978 under U.S. auspices. ``They still
provide a workable blueprint for resolving issues between us and
our Arab neighbors, including the Palestinian Arabs.''
   The Camp David agreement called for a period of limited
self-rule for Palestinians in the occupied territories.
   About 250 Palestinians and their supporters demonstrated outside
the Century Plaza Hotel as Shamir addressed 750 at a luncheon of
the World Affairs Council.
   The chanting demonstrators carried signs protesting Israeli
troops' violent suppression of Palestinian unrest in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
   About 20 members of the militant Jewish Defense League staged a
counter-demonstration outside the hotel, but there were no
confrontations, said police Sgt. Larry McKinley.
   In the occupied territories Friday, Israeli troops shot a
protester to death and at least 25 others were injured in violence
that erupted after Moslem noon prayers. The death was the 101st
since the unrest began 3{ months ago.
   Shamir's Likud bloc, which shares power with the more liberal
Labor Party, rejects Shultz' proposal for a conference including
the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. Such a meeting
would lead to demands that Israel give up territory it has held
since 1967 and considers vital to its defense, Shamir said.
   ``The Soviets have been pushing the idea because they know that
within this framework they can push a settlement favorable to
themselves and their Syrian clients,'' he said.
   Shamir, who arrived in Los Angeles on Thursday after talks in
Washington with Shultz, President Reagan and congressional leaders,
has sought to blunt criticism by some American Jews of his
country's action in the occupied territories.
   He reiterated that the picture of the Palestinian riots in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip has been distorted by the news
media, and said Americans shouldn't confuse the violence with
U.S.-style civil rights activism.
   ``It is war. It is an extension of urban terrorism,'' he said,
defending his troops' use of rubber bullets, beatings and live
ammunition.
   In answer to a question from the audience, Shamir said he
believed American Jews continue to support Israel despite the
controversy.
   ``I don't see any changes,'' Shamir said. ``I think the great
majority of the Jewish community in America supports the state of
Israel.''

Markets</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Friday named Treasury
Secretary James A. Baker III to head a working group to coordinate
recommendations for altering the government's regulation of
financial markets.
   The group was appointed under a presidential order after
Nicholas F. Brady, head of Reagan's task force on the Oct. 19 stock
market crash, told Congress on Thursday that a repeat of that event
could occur unless the government's regulatory authorities are put
under one roof.
   Brady's commission earlier had called for making the Federal
Reserve Board a ``super regulator'' with authority over both the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodities Futures
Trading Commission in regulating financial markets.
   But that idea has been rejected by the heads of all three
agencies.
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has said he doesn't want
the added authority. And a turf fight has erupted between SEC
Chairman David Ruder and the CFTC's new chairwoman, Wendy Gramm,
over which agency should regulate stock index futures.
   The SEC has blamed trading in stock index futures for worsening
the October crash, which saw the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial
stocks fall more than 500 points in one day.
   Ruder has suggested that regulation of trading in index futures
be transferred from the CFTC to his agency, an idea opposed by both
Gramm and Brady.
   Commodity exchanges where the futures are traded and the CFTC
have maintained that activity on the index futures markets Oct. 19
had no affect on the severity of the collapse in stock prices.
   Named with Baker to the working group were Greenspan, Ruder and
Gramm plus the five other governors now on the Federal Reserve's
board and four other members each from the SEC and CFTC.
   Reagan gave the group 60 days to report back to him on any
progress in ironing out their differences and coming up with
recommended legislation.
   ``The goals are two-fold,'' said White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater. ``First, to ensure the continued integrity,
competitiveness and efficiency of our nation's financial markets
and, second, to maintain the public's confidence in those markets.''
   Specifically, the panel was told to look at the desirability of
a ``tie-breaking referee'' with emergency powers and more formal
inter-maket coordination and cooperation mechanisms among the three
agencies.
   It also was told to examine the adequacy of private sector
capital for futures floor traders, market makers and broker-dealers
and whether margin requirements need to be strengthened and
``harmonized.''
   Other issues the panel was told to explore include the
desirability of simultaneous trading halts in all markets to clear
transactions, imposition of price limits on stocks, index futures
and options, emergency measures to restrict large, rapid
liquidations and revising equity short-sale rules.
   ``None of them is simple,'' Fitzwater said of the issues, `and,
while deserving high priority, may not be resolved quickly or
without considerable reflection.''

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Snow fell across a wide area of the East on Friday and much of
the nation's northern half had unseasonably low temperatures just
two days before spring.
   Light snow extended from Kentucky across West Virginia and Ohio
into Pennsylvania and New York.
   Snow advisories were posted in parts of northern Kentucky,
mountainous areas of Pennsylvania, and the northern mountains of
North Carolina.
   Rain showers extended from there to the Gulf Coast, scattered in
most areas but numerous in Alabama, Georgia and Florida.
   Temperatures were in the 30s and 40s east of the Rockies, except
for the Southeast, where it was warmer, and northern and central
Minnesota across to Upper Michigan, where early afternoon readings
were in the 20s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 21
degrees at Marquette, Mich., to 82 degrees at Thermal, Calif. The
morning low for the nation was 8 degrees below zero at Gunnison,
Colo.
   The forecast for Saturday called for showers and thunderstorms
in Florida; snow from New England to the Great Lakes region; rain
and snow from Indiana to New Jersey; rain from Maryland and West
Virginia to eastern South Carolina, and scattered showers across
Washington state and western Oregon.
   Temperatures will remain below 40 degrees from eastern Montana
through the Great Lakes region and northern Ohio Valley to New
England, including highs in the 20s and upper teens from eastern
North Dakota through the upper half of Michigan. Highs above 60
degrees were forecast from the coast of Oregon and northern
California through the southern Plains to northern Florida; in the
70s across southern Florida; in the 70s to low 80s from southern
and central California to southwestern New Mexico, and the 40s and
50s across most of the rest of the nation.

   Lt. Col. Oliver North, the fired national
security aide facing trial in the Iran-Contra affair, announced
Friday he has asked to retire from the Marine Corps and said he may
subpoena ``the highest-ranking officials in our government'' as
part of his defense.
   North submitted his request on Thursday, asking that he be
allowed to retire effective May 1 when he will have completed 20
years of active military service, Pentagon sources said.
   That is the minimum amount of service required to retire with a
pension. With 20 years of service, North is entitled to a pension
totaling 50 percent of his base monthly pay, or slightly over
$22,000 a year.
   In a statement read in the office of his attorney, Brendan
Sullivan, North said the lawyer ``has informed me that the defense
against these charges may require him to issue subpoenas for the
testimony and records of the highest ranking officials in our
government.''
   ``That strikes me as a course of action incompatible with my
continued service as a Marine officer,'' he continued.
``Accordingly, with great sadness, I have tendered my request to
retire from the Marine Corps.''
   North, who wore a civilian business suit in place of his usual
ribbon-bedecked Marine uniform, refused to answer questions after
reading the statement.
   North said he has ``silently endured a torrent of media
speculation'' during 16 months of Iran-Contra investigations. He
said he had not responded ``except when required by law,'' and that
``further silence is a disservice.''
   ``While on active duty, I am not fully free to speak out or to
take other actions which may be necessary,'' North said.
   A man, apparently a private security guard, controlled the
access of reporters and photographers to the room where North read
his statement. Before North entered, the guard told the press to
``keep your hands out of your pockets'' and to make no ``quick
moves.''
   According to one official, who agreed to discuss the matter only
if not identified, North has available a substantial amount of
accumulated leave and probably will stop working as a staff officer
at Marine Corps headquarters pending his retirement.
   North was reassigned to headquarters in November 1986 after
President Reagan fired him as an aide to the National Security
Council.
   The sources said there was nothing to block approval of North's
retirement request.
   They noted that Rear Adm. John Poindexter, North's former boss
and Reagan's former national security adviser, exercised his right
to retire from the Navy late last year.
   North, Poindexter and two others were indicted by a federal
grand jury Wednesday on charges they conspired to divert Iranian
arms sales profits to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   The 23-count indictment, which also named retired Air Force Maj.
Gen. Richard V. Secord and his business partner, Albert Hakim, said
the defendants organized, directed and concealed ``a program to
continue funding of and logistical and other support for military
and paramilitary operations in Nicaragua by the Contras'' at a time
U.S. law barred such action.
   North vowed after the indictment was returned to fight the
charges, declaring: ``I did not commit any crime.''
   North, a much-decorated combat veteran of Vietnam and graduate
of the U.S. Naval Academy, testified last year before Congress that
he always believed he had the approval of his superiors to take the
actions he did.
   Poindexter, during his testimony before Congress, said he never
informed the president of his decision to divert arms sale profits.
   The 44-year-old North is currently drawing a base pay of
$3,693.60 per month. Under military retirement rules, he will be
entitled to half that _ or slightly more than $22,000 a year.
   According to one source, North was technically required to
provide the Marine Corps with four months' advance notice before
retiring. The service is unlikely to balk, however, at granting him
a waiver of that advance-notice requirement, the source added.
   One Pentagon official said Gen. Alfred M. Gray, the Marine Corps
commandant, had already approved North's request and that it was
now awaiting only the approval of the Navy secretary's office.
   ``And that should come on Monday,'' said the source. ``This is
all very routine.''
   According to the Defense Department, the pension rights of North
and Poindexter are unlikely to be affected by the outcome of the
legal cases against them since both men served honorably for at
least 20 years.
   ``Generally speaking, a conviction does not affect eligibility
for a military pension,'' said Col. David Shea, a Pentagon
spokesman.

<HEAD>Group Seeks A Conservative GOP Platform</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Some Republican activists said Friday they
will fight to keep this year's GOP presidential campaign platform
true to conservative principles.
   They insisted their fight is not an effort to stop Vice
President George Bush, the front-runner in the GOP presidential
race.
   The group seeking to ``save the Reagan platform'' is spearheaded
by the American Conservative Union and Donald Devine, who recently
was ousted from a top post in Sen. Bob Dole's lagging presidential
campaign.
   ``This is not a stop-Bush campaign,'' Devine told a news
conference.
   But he repeatedly criticized a speech the vice president gave in
Chicago last week in which Bush promised a Bush administration
would press for a tough new code of ethics for government officials.
   ``Our purpose is to promote an agenda the Republican Party can
win on,'' said Devine, who was President Reagan's director of the
Office of Personnel Management from 1981 to 1985.
   To win in November, Bush must galvanize the support of
Republican activists who are overwhelmingly conservative, not shift
his policies toward the center, Devine and other conservative
leaders said.
   Daniel Graham, a retired Air Force lieutenant general who heads
High Frontier, a group pressing for development of the Strategic
Defense Initiative, said the Republican Party must take a strong
stand against cuts in the Pentagon budget.
   L. Brent Bozell III, chairman of the Conservative Victory
Committee, said the Republican platform ``must reaffirm that the
party is committed to the elimination of the ruthless Marxist
regime in Nicaragua.''
   Devine said efforts will be made to raise money for a
delegate-tracking system ``to identify the conservatives'' and
represent their views at the convention in New Orleans in August.
   Bush, in a speech to the Governor's Club in Chicago, had said he
was ``personally disturbed at the breaches of ethics I have seen in
the past few years in government.'' He said he would appoint an
ethics panel in the White House to draft a new code of ethics.
   Devine said Bush shouldn't have started ``talking about
something unnecessarily critical of Ronald Reagan.''
   ``I would think that a stronger Ethics in Government Act is one
that provided less discretion to independent prosecutors or
permanent prosecutors to make up charges,'' said Devine. ``We have
an Ethics in Government Act that says the appearance of a conflict
of interest is a felony. Now that's preposterous.''
   Bozell also criticized the Reagan administration's
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty with the Soviet Union and
claimed it has weakened support for anti-communist rebels in
Afghanistan and Angola.
   ``We're affirming the 1980 Republican platform, which is
unfortunately a far cry sometimes from the 1988 adminstration,''
said Bozell.
   Asked where conservatives could turn if they don't prevail on
the GOP platform, Devine said: ``Stay home.''
   Some conservatives believe they would be better off if they
relinquished the White House this year to a liberal Democrat such
as Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and reclaimed it in 1992, he
said.

<HEAD>Rescue Workers Remove Bodies From Colombian Plane Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CUCUTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rescue workers on Friday removed remains
of the 138 people who died when an Avianca jetliner slammed into an
Andean peak, burst into flames and started a landslide.
   A Bogota newspaper, quoting an Avianca executive, reported
Friday that the Boeing 727-100 hit the mountain after it swerved to
avoid a collision with with another Avianca plane.
   But another company official said the cause of the crash had not
been determined.
   No Americans were reported on the domestic flight.
   Witnesses said the plane clipped trees before slamming into the
mountainside Thursday near Zulia, 50 miles north of Cucuta, where
it had taken off.
   A police inspector in nearby Campo Alicia, Augusto Bautista,
said the impact ``opened a hole that looked like a crater in a
volcano.''
   Col. Miguel Benedetti, civil defense director for the state of
North Santander, said Thursday night that there were no survivors.
The government and Avianca said there were 131 passengers and seven
crew members aboard. Both had given different figures earlier.
   The government said it had begun an investigation but recovery
personnel had not yet located the plane's ``black box,'' which
could provide clues to the cause of the crash.
   ``This tragedy has saddened many Colombian homes,'' President
Virgilio Barco said in a Thursday night speech on television.
   The plane took off from Cucuta, 250 miles northeast of Bogota,
and was to stop at the Caribbean ports of Barranquilla and
Cartegena.
   Rain, snow and rough terrain hampered rescue efforts Thursday.
Civil Aeronautics Agency officials said that work crews, some using
helicopters, returned to the crash site Friday.
   Bautista said the remains of the victims were scattered and many
passengers had been buried by a landslide touched off by the jet.
   ``It's not possible to recognize anyone,'' he said.
   Police, civil defense workers, Red Cross members and local
residents placed bodies in plastic bags and loaded them on
helicopters headed for Cucuta.
   The Bogota daily ``El Siglo'' on Friday quoted Raul Garcia, an
Avianca vice president, as saying that the pilot had swerved ``to
avoid a collision'' with another Avianca jet flying from Bogota to
Cucuta.
   Garcia was quoted as saying the two pilots communicated by radio
before the accident and that the second plane landed safely shortly
after the crash.
   He did not return phone calls to his office Friday.
   Airport officials at Cucuta would not comment.
   But Jairo Mejia, Avianca's director of operations, told the
newspaper ``we can't give too much credibility to speculation'' and
said the cause of the crash had not been determined.
   Local residents said the plane appeared to be flying low before
it slammed into 8,000-foot La Cuchilla peak.
   However, the operator of the control tower at Cucuta's airport,
Ivan Robayo, said the plane was flying normally and had not
reported any trouble.
   ``The pilot said he was climbing to 26,000 feet and soon after
that I lost radio contact with him,'' Robayo said.
   The agency said the passenger list included Monsignor Horacio
Olave Velandia, 44, the Roman Catholic auxiliary bishop of Tibu,
and at least 31 soccer players from two teams flying to a
tournament in Cartagena.
   The soccer teams were affiliated with the state petroleum
company Ecopetrol.
   Colombia's last major air crash occurred July 27, 1985, when an
air force transport plane went down in the Amazon jungle, killing
74 people. The military plane was carrying civilian passengers
because of an airline strike.

   An 84-year-old jeweler, threatened
at knifepoint by two men, led them to a cache of diamonds then
pulled a gun and shot one of them.
   The wounded man was quickly arrested. The other man was arrested
the next day because the jeweler knew him and showed police where
he lived, said the jeweler, Lou Marks.
   Police said they doubt Marks would be charged in the shooting,
in which one robber was wounded in the chest and neck.
   Marks' daughter, Mrs. Marion Macri, 59, who lives with him, said
the incident began Wednesday night with a knock on the door. Her
father opened the door.
   Two men forced their way in, threw Marks to the floor and told
Mrs. Macri to get down as well. They took $68 in cash from Marks
and about $20 from Mrs. Macri's purse. Then Marks, who sells
jewelry from his home, tricked them.
   ``I've got a lot of jewelry you can have. Take it and go,''
Marks said he told them. ``When I said: `Follow me, I'll show you
my diamonds,' I knew I was halfway home.''
   Marks on Thursday said he led them into his den. While they
looked at the jewels, he grabbed a .32-caliber gun he had owned for
20 years and never fired, he said.
   ``I said, `Lord, please let the gun be loaded' and it was,'' he
said. ``When I put my finger on that gun, I said, `Dear Lord you
have saved my life,' and I shot him point-blank. I let him have it,
right in the chest.''
   Marks shot at the other man but missed. Both men fled.
   ``I don't feel a bit of remorse,'' he said. ``They weren't going
to let me live.''
   Raymond Edward Sumther, 39, was under police guard Friday at
Bayfront Medical Center. He was charged with armed burglary
assault, police spokesman George Pickney said.
   Gary Glover, 30, was arrested Thursday on the same charge and
was being held on $15,000 bail, Pinckney said.
   Marks had led police to Glover, whom he said he had once fed.
The jeweler went to a motel where Glover often stayed, and when
Marks saw him he called police.
   ``You befriend a man and then he comes back six months later and
does this,'' Marks said.

   Iran and Iraq reported firing 41 missiles
into each other's cities Friday and said their warplanes and
gunships attacked five ships in one of the fiercest spasms of
fighting in the gulf war in the past year.
   Communiques from both sides said seven jet fighters were shot
down and Iran claimed thousands of Iraqis slain in a northern
offensive.
   Iran said its forces had captured two towns in a 5-day-old drive
into northeastern Iraq, in which it claims 9,200 Iraqis have been
killed or wounded and 4,000 taken prisoner. It said its forces had
recaptured Nowsud, an Iranian border town.
   Nowsud was overrun by Iraqi soldiers soon after the war began in
September 1980.
   Dispatches from the official Islamic Republic News Agency
claimed five Iraqi jets were destroyed in 24 hours, including three
French-built F-1 Mirage fighter-bombers out to raid Iranian tankers
in the northern Persian Gulf. Iraq claimed two Iranian jets downed.
   Iraq acknowledged losing one plane, but Iran did not admit
losses.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said its
planes carried out 254 sorties against Iranian targets Friday
including a ``devastating raid'' on the northern city of Tabriz.
   The news agency said air force planes evaded Iranian fighter
patrols and hit two ``large maritime targets,'' which usually means
tankers, off Iran between 9 p.m. Thursday and 9 a.m. Friday.
   Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit in London confirmed one
attack, on the Iranian-chartered Cypriot tanker Kyrenicos. It said
at least one missile hit the 80,137-ton vessel as it steamed south
from Iran's Kharg Island terminal with a full load before dawn
Friday.
   Chartered and Iranian-owned tankers shuttle oil for export from
Kharg, which has been a frequent target of Iraqi bombing raids, to
makeshift terminals in the safer waters of the southern gulf.
   Iranian gunboats attacked three neutral ships in the southern
gulf Friday in apparent retaliation for the Kyrenicos raid and two
other confirmed Iraqi attacks in recent days. There had been a
monthlong lull in the ``tanker war,'' in which more than 400 ships
have been hit since it began four years ago.
   Shipping officials said a Japanese seaman was killed on the
Panamanian tanker Maria 2 in the first Iranian raid soon after
midnight and the other 20 crewmen, all South Koreans, abandoned
ship when a fire started. Several were reported wounded, but all
were rescued by the United Arab Emirates coast guard.
   An attack on the 284,494-ton Norwegian tanker Berge Lord started
a small fire and the 87,768-ton Singapore-flag tanker Neptune
Saburu also was hit. No casualties were reported in either case.
   IRNA, the Iranian agency, said 24 missiles were fired late
Thursday and early Friday into Zubair, an industrial town in
southern Iraq, and Haretha and Shubair nearby.
   Six short-range rockets were fired at the southern port of
Basra, Khanaqin in the central border area, Mosul in Kurdistan and
the northern frontier town of Banmil, it said.
   According to Iraqi dispatches, seven long-range missiles were
launched at Tehran. Iran reported at least eight civilians killed
and many wounded.
   Baghdad Radio announced two more Iranian missiles struck the
northern cities of Mosul and Kirkuk Friday night. But Tehran
television announced two missiles were fired at each city in the
attacks.
   Iraq gave no report on its casualties from missile attacks.
   Hundreds of civilians have been killed on both sides in the
latest round of the intermittent ``war of the cities,'' which began
Feb. 29, and thousands have died since the conflict began.
   Reports of artillery attacks and air raids on a dozen other
cities, with heavy casualties, came from both sides.
   Tehran said Revolutionary Guards pushing into the northern
mountains Friday overran the ``military towns'' of Tawla, three
miles north of Nowsud, and Byara a few miles farther north, killing
or wounding 700 Iraqis and capturing 200.
   War communiques claimed Iranian forces had seized nearly 400
square miles of territory with a two-pronged offensive.
   According to IRNA, the drive was being led by Soviet-made T-72
tanks captured from the Iraqis when the Iranians stormed the Faw
Peninsula in southern Iraq two years ago.
   It claimed Iraqi warplanes dropped chemical bombs on Dojaila and
Halabja, two northeastern towns captured Thursday, ``killing many
defenseless residents.''
   A correspondent for the agency reported the two towns were ``in
ruins,'' strewn with the bodies of civilians. He said the Iraqis
also dropped cluster and phosporous bombs that killed ``scores of
people.''

   The Democratic Party on Friday added another
delegate to the number attending this summer's national convention
in Atlanta, bringing the total to 4,163.
   Mayor Joseph Riley of Charleston, S.C., will attend as a
representative of the National Conference of Democratic Mayors.
   That seat had been held by Detroit Mayor Coleman A. Young, who
also has claim to a delegate's seat because he is a member of the
Democratic National Committee from Michigan.
   Under party rules, Young could assign another mayor to take his
seat to represent the mayors' conference, according to Jim Carey,
executive director of the party's Compliance Assistance Commission.

   Richard Gephardt promised Friday to defend ``American jobs
rather than foreign protectionism,'' and Michael Dukakis attacked
President Reagan's policy in Central America as the two Democratic
presidential hopefuls pointed toward next week's Michign showdown.
   Vice President George Bush, enjoying the status of near-nominee
on the Republican side, said Reagan ``did the right thing'' when he
dispatched combat troops to Honduras. Rival Bob Dole's campaign was
reduced to skeletal remains with only about a dozen paid aides
remaining.
   Meanwhile, the man who directed President Reagan's investigation
into the Iran-Contra affair said he doubted the episode would
damage Vice President George Bush's bid for the White House. ``I
fully expect the opposition to use it on him,'' said former Sen.
John Tower of Texas, but he added the voters ``will tend to focus
on the problems of the moment'' and not the past.
   The Republican campaign was quiet, appropriately so for a race
that has been all but wrapped up by Bush.
   Democrats were running full tilt, with caucuses, primaries and
conventions in Kansas, Texas, Puerto Rico and South Dakota this
weekend offering 169 delegates, and the big 138-delegate Michigan
caucus showdown a week away.
   ``I'm the underdog today, but that doesn't really matter,''
Gephardt said as he and 18 House Democratic colleagues moved
through Michigan. ``I think you will see that the Gephardt message
about economic revival is going to get through to the Michigan
voters.''
   Dukakis, ahead in a new public poll as well as his own,
countered with Massachusetts Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, who agreed to
appear at labor rallies in two Michigan cities. Looking ahead to
other staes, Dukakis also picked up an endorsement from Rep. Sam
Gejdenson of Connecticut. Sources said he would receive one from
Rep. Jim Florio of New Jersey on Saturday.
   The governor divided his time between Michigan and Kansas during
the day, and he hit hard against Reagan's decision to airlift 3,200
combat troops to Honduras. ``The whole policy in Central America is
illegal,'' he said. ``Call back the troops and end this.''
   He also criticized the idea of possible presidential pardons for
Oliver North and others indicted in the Iran-Contra affair on
Wednesday. But he said, ``I don't want to consider the political
effects'' of the indictments.
   Bush disagreed strongly with him on Central America.
   ``We did the proper thing,'' he said in an interview with a
Puerto Rico television station conducted by telephone. ``We are for
freedom and democracy. There is no question that Nicaragua invaded
Honduras.''
   Gephardt was focusing almost exclusively on Michigan, which
poses a make-or-break test for his faltering candidacy. He and
Dukakis already have begun airing television commercials in the
state, even though the caucuses are a week away.
   Campaigning in regions of the state where factories have closed
in recent years, he said, ``It's time we had a president who
defended American jobs rather than foreign protectionism. I reject
the notion that in order to move some of us ahead, we must leave
millions behind.''
   Jesse Jackson won the endorsement of George Sallade, who headed
former candidate Gary Hart's Michigan campaign in 1984 and again
this year. Sallade said he thought most of Hart's supporters would
follow suit. ``I expect the racists, if they exist, to be
outnumbered next Saturday,'' he said.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., of Tennessee campaigned in Puerto Rico
looking for support in Sunday's primary. He said he would consider
a request from the Popular Democratic Party to exempt the
commonwealth from federal minimum wage laws and said he favors
letting Puerto Ricans decide whether to become a state.
   Dole's campaign has been severely curtailed since Tuesday's
Illinois primary defeat at the hands of Bush. Spokeswoman Dale Tate
said only about 10 to 12 aides were left on the payroll, although
several other officials were volunteering their services. The
campaign once employed about 300 persons, she said.
   Dole has vowed to stay in the race until the Wisconsin primary
on April 5, but Ms. Tate said the Kansas senator was unlikely to
air television commercials in Connecticut, which votes on March 29.
   The other active challenger to Bush, former television
evangelist Pat Robertson, campaigned in California, where he
proclaimed, ``There has to be a rallying point for conservatives.''
   With Bush holding an overwhelming lead in nominating delegates
over his two rivals, most interest focused on the still murky
Democratic race.
   Dukakis and Jackson both spent time in Kansas, which holds
caucuses on Saturday with 39 delegates at stake.
   At Washburn University in Topeka, Jackson accused Reagan of
``fighting psychological warfare with the Congress, manipulating
the public mind for more Contra aid.''
   Gephardt also looked to translate his victory in last month's
South Dakota primary into delegates at a statewide convention on
Saturday. And Dukakis and Jackson, the two top finishers in the
Texas primary on March 8, looked to carve up most of the 64
delegates at the state's caucuses on Saturday.
   The other campaign contest of the weekend is Puerto Rico's
primary, with 51 delegates at stake.
   Gephardt's campaign chartered two jets to ferry House members to
Michigan to campaign on his behalf. The Missouri congressman ``is
obviously a known quantity,'' said Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich. ``We
also know how he responds in a crisis. We in Congress don't like
weaklings or phonies.''
   The other Democrat in the race, Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, is
essentially conceding Michigan to his rivals. He campaigned in
Pennsylvania during the day, where he criticized Reagan's decision
to send combat troops to Honduras. ``I think, candidly, it was
designed not to meet a military threat to Honduras, but to try to
line up some votes in the House and the Senate for military aid to
the Contras. And I don't think it's going to work,'' he said.

   Here are some comments Friday by candidates

   RICHARD GEPHARDT, on the Michigan situation: ``I'm the underdog

that. If you're talking about winning the nomination, I can do
that.''
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, on the Reagan administration's actions in
Central America: ``The whole policy in Central America is illegal.
Call back the troops and end this.''
   
   PAT ROBERTSON, saying he will stay in the GOP race as a rallying
point for conservatives: ``If everybody drops out, then whatever
policies are being advocated by George Bush will become the
policies of the Republican Party.''
   
   AL GORE, setting his sights on the presidency in 1988, not
beyond: ``Anybody who thinks I'm involved in a dress rehearsal will
find out otherwise. I'm in this to win.''

   The army began moving about 2,000
soldiers into the border jungles Friday with orders to drive out a
Nicaraguan force of half that size.
   Roughly 2,000 Nicaraguan soldiers had been reported in the
mountainous area Thursday, the day after Honduras said they crossed
the frontier pursuing Contra rebels. A ranking Honduran officer
said 1,000 of them remained on the Honduran side Friday.
   About 800 American paratroopers _ among the last to arrive of
the 3,200 soldiers sent to Honduras _ were dropped onto Palmerola
air base Friday morning. The Defense Department says the U.S.
forces will be in Central America for a 10-day training exercise.
   Gen. Fred F. Woerner, commander of the U.S. Southern Command
based in Panama, arrived to review the exercise and said it was ``a
reassuring factor to our allies, not only in Honduras but
elsewhere.''
   He said there were ``some very, very preliminary'' indications
that Sandinista troops were beginning to withdraw, but the duration
of the U.S. exercise was ``not necessarily'' linked to that.
   The Honduran officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
two Honduran infantry battalions totaling 1,600 to 2,000 soldiers
were moving in from a base at Juticalpa, about 90 miles west. He
said warplanes were on call from the Tamara air base 15 miles north
of Tegucigalpa.
   Orders were given for the soldiers to expel the ``invading
troops'' with whatever means necessary, he said, adding that about
half the original force had fled to Nicaragua. Honduran soldiers
began sweeping the border region for mines Thursday but none had
been found, he reported.
   Honduras gave the Sandinistas 24 hours to get their soldiers out
of the country, but the time of the deadline was not stated.
   The Sandinistas have denied entering Honduras but a Nicaraguan
military source indicated privately that they had.
   Nicaragua's northern military headquarters is near the frontier
in Bocay and Honduran warplanes flew raids in the area Thursday,
hours after U.S. troops began arriving in Honduras.
   U.S. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci said the American troops
from the 82nd Airborne and 7th Light Infantry were sent on a 10-day
training exercise to provide ``moral support'' and would be kept
away from combat.
   Pentagon officials said privately the four U.S. battalions would
spend eight or nine days training with Hondurans in different parts
of the country.
   One battalion of the 82nd Airborne will be at Juticalpa, an
official said, ``but anyone who knows the country'' would realize
the 90 miles ``might as well be 4,000. There's nothing but
mountains and jungle in between.''
   ``The basic order that these troops aren't to get near the
fighting still stands,'' he said.
   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua said Thursday his soldiers
were ready to ``combat and liquidate'' the 82nd Airborne if
necessary.
   Alejandro Bendana, secretary-general of the Nicaraguan Foreign
Ministry, said ``one step ... could lead to another'' in the border
conflict, indicating war might result.
   The U.S.-supported Contras have secret bases in Honduras from
which to attack across the border in their 6-year-old battle with
the Sandinistas.
   Manuel Suarez, spokesman for the Honduran armed forces, told
local reporters President Jose Azcona Hoyo would continue telephone
conversations with Ortega and other Central American leaders,
trying ``to avoid a break in the peace process that has been
developing in the region.''
   Among provisions of the peace plan signed by the five Central
American countries Aug. 7 are cease-fires in civil wars and a ban
on the use of one country's territory for attacks on another.
   Azcona, 60, has been reported ill with flu for several days and
canceled several meetings. The daily newspaper La Prensa said he
was dealing with the situation from his home.
   La Prensa printed an editorial cartoon in which Uncle Sam said
``There's an invasion in Honduras'' while Azcona, a member of the
armed forces and a diplomat look around saying, ``Where, where,
where?''
   Members of the legislature demanded a meeting with Foreign
Minister Carlos Lopez to be told why they were not asked to approve
Azcona's request that American soldiers be sent in.
   Reports on Thursday's air raids conflicted.
   Nicaragua's Foreign Ministry blamed the United States and made a
formal protest.
   Reagan administration officials said one of Nicaragua's
Soviet-supplied helicopters was destroyed, but the Sandinistas
denied it. Nicaragua is believed to have more than 40 military
helicopters.
   Honduras said its air force attacked only inside its own
territory.
   Suarez, the military spokesman, said the Honduran air force
raided along the border near San Andres de Bocay, site of the
Sandinista military headquarters in northern Nicaragua.
   Reporters flown to San Andres de Bocay saw two jet aircraft,
unidentified, fly in from Honduras just after noon Thursday and
drop at least five bombs near the border.

<HEAD>San Juan Capistrano Prepares to Celebrate Return of Swallows</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A wonder both spiritual and
touristic will be played out Saturday at Mission San Juan
Capistrano when thousands of visitors scan the skies for returning
cliff swallows.
   In other urban areas, the small, noisy birds are considered a
messy menace. Their pilgrimage from Argentina to regions as far
north as Alaska goes unappreciated. Their mud nests are destroyed
before eggs are laid.
   But here the annual migration is considered a marvel, thanks to
a 1939 song that popularized a legend about a Franciscan padre
befriending the weary birds when an inn keeper smashed their nests.
   Some 9,000 swallow-seekers are expected to flock to the
cobblestone streets around the 212-year-old mission during the
annual celebration of the cleft-tailed birds' official return on
March 19, St. Joseph's Day.
   ``When you think about it, who really cares if they come back
every year? People are cyclical. It assures us that things are not
screwed up,'' said Alan Lieberman, curator of birds for the San
Diego Zoo, some 60 miles south.
   He added: ``I think it romanticizes love among the animals.''
   As legend has it, the swallows have failed the camera- and
binocular-toters only once, in 1935, when they were reportedly
delayed by a storm.
   Accounts of the swallows were recorded nearly from 1776, the
year Father Junipero Serra founded the mission. Leon Rene's 1939
song ``When the Swallows Come Back to Capistrano'' put the town on
the map.
   In recent years, the number of birds sighted on March 19 has
dropped from thousands to a handful. Mission and tourism officials
maintain that the shy birds are scared off by the welcoming hoopla.
   The insect-eating birds also are a victim of urbanization that
has turned the small farming town 60 miles south of Los Angeles
into a community of 22,500. Lush orange groves and mudflats have
become parking lots and condominiums.
   Instead of nesting in the shade of the renovated mission, many
of the white-bellied, brown birds set up house under the eaves of
buildings and freeway overpasses in outlying areas.
   ``The swallows, they don't come like they used to. There are too
many people here now and they scare them away,'' laments Paul
Arbiso, 92, the mission's gardener and bell ringer since 1910.
   Arbiso will ring four antique bells when he first sees a swallow
Saturday, kicking off an all-day party.
   The festivities should begin fairly early since the first birds
to complete the 6,000-mile journey from Goya, Argentina, arrived
several weeks ago, said Brian McInerney, director of tourism for
the mission.
   ``We've got about 1,500 swallows at the mission already,''
McInerney said earlier this week.
   The mission also has 50 workers answering inquiries from around
the world, said McInerney. Last year's event put about $50,000 in
the mission's coffers, he said.
   The local Chamber of Commerce said it does not keep a tally on
the birds' economic impact, but spokeswoman Jan Hessell said hotels
in the area are booked and merchants ready for the onslaught.
   ``People will buy anything with a swallow on it, and the mobs
have to have somewhere to eat,'' she said.
   The event has its detractors. Some bird experts argue that
migrating animals don't make or keep appointments.
   ``March 19 is a day people chose and I'm not sure the swallows
are aware of it,'' said Gerald Collier, a San Diego State
University orinthologist. ``They do come around the beginning of
spring.''
   He also points out that there are between 50 million and 100
million cliff swallows in the wild. ``So 1,500 come to San Juan
Capistrano,'' he said. ``Where are all the rest?''
   Some swallows will go to a shopping mall in nearby Mission
Viejo, where nests from last year await them under the eaves of a
department store.
   Hershey Gehris, the mall's general manager, recalls a different
attitude towards cliff swallows in Campbell, Calif.
   ``They used to fight them more than here,'' Gehris said. ``They
do things to your clothes that make you a little upset, and they do
marvelous things to the paint job on your car.''
   ``I think they're neat around here,'' he adds. ``But I don't
think I'd want them around all the time.''

<HEAD>Top Soviet Officials Meet with Armenians, Azerbaijanis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven Soviet leaders, including the Kremlin's No.
2 man, met Friday with leading Armenians and Azerbaijanis to
express the ruling Politburo's concern about ethnic rioting that
killed at least 32 people.
   The news agency Tass said Yegor K. Ligachev, second to Mikhail
S. Gorbachev in the hierarchy, also met separately with a group of
workers from Nagorno-Karabakh, the predominantly Armenian region of
Azerbaijan that Armenians want to annex.
   Armenian protests last month to support the annexation touched
off a wave of unrest in the two southern Soviet republics. On Feb.
28, rioting broke out in Sumgait, a city of Azerbaijan, and
officials say 32 people were killed.
   Tass said that Moscow-based science and cultural figures of
Armenian and Azerbaijani descent were at Friday's meeting in the
Communist Party Central Committee.
   It said that at the session, ``serious concern was expressed in
connection with the developments in the Nagorno-Karabakh autonomous
region and the situation in Soviet Armenia and Azerbaijan.''
   Besides Ligachev, officials attending included full Politburo
members Lev Zaikov and Mikhail Solomentsev; candidate members Pyotr
Demichev, Vladimir Dolgikh and Georgy Razumovsky, and Central
Committee Secretary Anatoly Lukyanov.
   Among the Armenians and Azerbaijanis at the meeting were M.P.
Mchedlov, deputy director of the Central Committee's Institute of
Marxism-Leninism; F.K. Salmanov, first deputy geology minister;
S.A. Sitaryan, first deputy director of the State Planning
Committee; and K.N. Brutens, editor of a historical journal, Tass
reported.
   It said the meeting was ``at the recommendation of the
Politburo,'' a sign of official concern about the ethnic unrest.
   Tass said those attending came up with ``constructive
suggestions that were taken into account and would help handle in a
better way problems of economic, social and intellectual life in
the region.'' It did not go into detail.
   The agency provided no further information on the meeting
between Ligachev and the workers from Nagorno-Karabakh.
   On Feb. 26, Gorbachev appealed for ``civic maturity and
restraint'' in Armenia and Azerbaijan and pledged that the
policy-making Central Committee would review relations among this
vast nation's more than 100 nationalities.
   Armenian activists reported in telephone calls to The Associated
Press on Thursday that Armenians conducted a general strike in
Stepanakert, the main city of Nagorno-Karabakh, to demand
annexation to Armenia.
   The Armenian republic's official Yerevan Radio reported Friday
that 1,661 Armenians had arrived in Armenia from Azerbaijan since
the rioting in Sumgait. The radio report was monitored by the
British Broadcasting Corp. in London.
   It said a government commission under First Deputy Premier
Vladimir Movsisyan was in charge of helping the refugees
   Armenians are predominantly Christians, while Azeries, the
dominant group in Azerbaijan, are mostly Shiite Moslems.

   Some homes these days go begging for a buyer.
   But the reason has nothing to do with high prices or rising
interest rates.
   A new sales gimmick allows prospective home buyers to drive up
to a house, tune their car radio to an AM frequency and hear the
low-down on closets, bedrooms and that unseen swimming pool out
back without getting out of the car.
   The device has a range of about 150 feet and a tape that plays
for a couple minutes.
   Robin Stella, a vice president at Robert Stone Inc. real estate
agency, said Friday her company began using the talking house
device three months ago and sales this year are up 43 percent.
   Ms. Stella said the device deserves at least some credit for the
boost.
   The devices are used primarily to sell houses, but its
manufacturer, Realty Electronics in Fond du Lac, Wis., said other
applications are being discovered.
   ``We certainly envision a time when they are very common _ that
you pull up to a bank and hear about their interest rates; that you
go to a drive-in restaurant and hear about the specials,'' said
Scott Matthew, vice president.
   Already, some of the 10,000 devices sold have gone to car washes
with long lines that use it to peddle their waxes.
   Car dealers closed on Sunday employ it to entice buyers who go
window shopping. A shopping mall in Ohio is using it to advertise
mark-downs.
   The inspiration came from Disney amusement parks, where visitors
tune their radios to a certain frequency to find out more about the
attractions, Matthew said.

<HEAD>High School Calm After Two Days of Fights</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CANTON, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police stood guard at a high school Friday
after two days of fights between ``jocks'' and ``burnouts'' that
began over control of a hallway hangout.
   Louise Gates, a spokeswoman at Plymouth-Canton High School in
suburban Detroit, said there was one minor scuffle Friday that
lasted about 10 minutes.
   Fights between student-athletes and burnouts, who students said
are distinguished by their leather jackets and rock concert
T-shirts, erupted Wednesday and Thursday.
   Administrators said the fighting began over use of a gathering
place known as ``the pit.''
   There were no injuries, but at least 12 students were suspended
for fighting, and school officials sealed off the pit, officials
said.
   About 20 officers from Canton and nearby Plymouth Township were
called in to restore order Thursday. Police declined to say how
many officers were at the school Friday.
   ``The amount of police that they brought in was outrageous. It
gave the kids a reason to keep going,'' said Reeder Singler, a
student at nearby Plymouth-Salem High School who also takes classes
at Plymouth-Canton.
   Singler, who doesn't align himself with either group, added:
``With the police here, it's just making things worse. Things would
have died down naturally, but now something might happen sometime
in the future.''
   He said the battle is ``not really over turf.''
   ``It's over discrimination of one group over another,'' he said.
The burnouts feel the jocks receive preferential treatment from
some administrators and faculty members, he said.
   On Thursday, the burnouts sent Principal Thomas Tattan a note
saying, ``We feel we should be treated with the same courtesy as
other peer and social groups. We believe you're taking the jocks'
side over the pit issue.''
   The two groups met Friday to try to resolve the issue, but the
meeting broke up when administrators tried to join the discussions,
Singler said. The groups will continue to talk, he said.
   Gates said administrators talked to both sides, but declined to
reveal what was discussed.

   Israeli troops fired on Palestinians in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip on Friday following noontime Moslem
prayers, killing two Arabs, the army said.
   At least 25 protesters were wounded in the clashes, hospital
officials reported.
   Two Israeli civilians were detained for allegedly stockpiling an
arsenal of weapons intended for anti-Arab attacks, according to
police.
   Israeli military authorities detained a prominent attorney from
Gaza and four Arab journalists, prompting an outcry from Israeli
liberals. Authorities also ordered foreign journalists out of the
Gaza Strip and many areas of the West Bank.
   Chief of Staff Dan Shomron called on Israel's leaders to reach
an accord with the Arabs to end more than 14 weeks of unrest.
   In an interview with the daily Davar newspaper, Shomron said the
Israeli army ``cannot endure this situation forever. The matter has
to be solved.''
   The latest deaths brought to 102 the number of Palestinians
killed during the violent uprising, according to U.N. figures. Most
of the deaths were caused by gunfire or beatings.
   U.N. officials in Nicosia, Cyprus said that more than 400
Palestinian refugees had been injured in Gaza this week, bringing
to more than 900 the number of casualties in March.
   Protests erupted at the Shati refugee camp in Gaza after
hundreds of worshipers streamed from the camp's Al-Gharbi mosque
and saw soldiers scuffling with three youths, witnesses said.
   Troops dropped tear gas canisters from helicopters and fired
rubber bullets before using live ammunition to restore order, the
witnesses and the army said.
   The army said one Palestinian was killed there. Officials at
Shifa Hospital identified him as 24-year-old Hani Abu Hamam.
   At the Ein Beit Ilmah refugee camp near Nablus, the largest city
in the West Bank, a youth was fatally wounded when he attacked a
soldier during a protest, an army spokeswoman said.
   The spokeswoman, not identified in line with military rules,
said the victim had assaulted the soldier with ``a dangerous
object,'' but did not say what the object was.
   ``In saving himself, the soldier shot the boy, and that resulted
in death,'' she said.
   Officials at Nablus' Ittihad hospital said the victim,
identified as Muhamed Mahmud Suleiman Khaled, 19, was dead on
arrival. Jehad Alawni, a nurse, said Khaled was shot in the left
thigh and bled to death.
   The nurse said Khaled was shot at a military outpost and not
during a protest, but the army spokeswoman denied that account.
   In the West Bank city of Ramallah, 10 miles north of Jerusalem,
troops confronted about 200 Arab youths outside Ramallah Hospital.
   In an apparently new tactic, troops dumped gravel from
helicopters on protesters below before using live ammunition. Two
Palestinian men were shot and wounded. One was in serious condition
with a wound to the abdomen, hospital officials said.
   Two 44-year-old Israelis, identified by the Haaretz newspaper as
Moshe Vinokor of Rishon Lezion and Gershon Luxemburg of Jerusalem,
were detained after police discovered they had stockpiled a large
arsenal of weapons, apparently for use in attacks against Arabs,
police said.
   Investigators determined the two had acted alone and were not
part of a larger ring, Haaretz said.
   The army also rounded up scores of suspected Palestinian
activists this week in a crackdown aimed at curbing riots on Land
Day, a traditional Palestinian nationlist day that falls on March
30, Israel radio and Arab reports said. The Arab-owned Palestine
Press Service set the number of detainees at about 400.
   Mohammed Abu Shaban, the vice president of the Gaza Bar
Association, was picked up late Thursday after participating in a
gathering at Tel Aviv University protesting Israeli policies in the
territories.
   Abu Shaban has represented several Gazans in appeals to the
Israeli Supreme Court. Tel Aviv University professors and the
left-wing Citizens' Rights Movement sent a telegram to Defense
Minister Yitzhak Rabin demanding Abu Shaban's release.
   Israeli army officials alleged Abu Shaban was involved in
subversive activities, but Israeli liberals contended he was picked
up because of his participation in the Tel Aviv gathering.
   ``It's devastating to believe that people cannot talk freely on
our campus,'' university professor Moshe Shaked said on Israel
radio.
   Four Arab journalists also were detained, according to Arab
reports.
   Chief of Staff Shomron said Israeli leaders should open peace
talks even before calm returns. He said demonstrations could be
ended immediately if the army ordered soldiers to open fire on
protesters, a move he would oppose.
   ``If someone wants to achieve calm at the cost of ordering the
army to ... go against the basic norms of the Israeli army,'' he
said, ``then it will have to be without me.''

   The Customs Service has donated about $20
million in clothing to three African nations through an agreement
with the Agency for International Development, officials said
Thursday.
   The agreement, signed by Customs Commissioner William von Raab
and AID Administrator Alan Woods, establishes a permanent program
allowing the transfer of seized textile merchandise for
humanitarian distribution.
   ``This is a true case of government triumphing over its own
bureaucracy,'' said von Raab, noting that ``it benefits more than
the egos of government officials. Someone will actually benefit
from this.''
   Previously, Customs had no recourse but to spend ``hundreds of
thousands of taxpayers' dollars to destroy this clothing,'' von
Raab said.
   A major shipment of clothing was seized after the People's
Republic of China alerted Customs that counterfeit documents were
being used to bring the items into the country.
   The clothing includes cotton jeans, shirts, dresses, denim
jackets and infants' cotton shirts manufactured in China.
   AID will turn the clothing over to World Vision Relief
Organization and the Adventist Development and Relief Agency for
distribution in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe, where it is
expected to clothe 20,000 children.

<HEAD>Four Powerful Democrats to Try to Alter INF Treaty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three powerful Senate chairmen and the Senate
Democratic leader agreed Friday to seek to amend the arms treaty
signed by President Reagan and Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev in a
way that would limit future presidents' ability to reinterpret the
accord.
   The administration immediately denounced the move.
   Under the amendment, interpretations of the Intermediate Nuclear
Forces treaty by President Reagan and his sucessors in the White
House would be based not just on the treaty text but on the full
record of Senate ratification hearings.
   The condition would be attached to prevent the a recurrence of
what many senators have charged is Reagan's overly broad
interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
   That interpretation has been used to justify testing and
development of Reagan's strategic defense initiative, often called
``Star Wars.''
   Congressional sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the decision to attach the condition _ to prevent future broad
interpretations of the INF pact _ was made at a luncheon by the
four leading senators.
   They are Majority Leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia, Foreign
Relations Chairman Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, Armed Services
Chairman Sam Nunn of Georgia and Intelligence Committee co-chairman
David Boren.
   The original author of the proposal was Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del.
   Their condition will be presented to the foreign relations panel
during consideration of the treaty next week, the sources said.
   The INF, signed by Reagan and Gorbachev in December, would
eliminate all land-based missiles with ranges between 300 and 3,125
miles and has been hailed by most senators of both parties as an
important step forward in arms control.
   Ratification by the required two-thirds of the Senate is
expected, but the attachments of conditions opposed by the
administration would be a complicating factor.
   In a commentary attached to the proposed amendment the senators
have said their purpose was not to resolve the dispute over the ABM
Treaty.
   ``Rather the provision is intended to reaffirm certain
constitutional principles which have been brought into question
during the `reinterpretation' debate,'' the commentary said.
   In that debate, many Democrats have argued that the ABM treaty,
as outlined during the ratification hearings in 1972, prevents much
Star Wars testing and development. The administration has asserted
that its interpretation _ based on the text and the record of
negotiations with the Soviets _ permits Star Wars development.
   The White House, meanwhile, in a letter to Sen. Richard Lugar,
R-Ind., a member of the foreign relations panel, reiterated its
opposition to attaching conditions to the INF treaty.
   The letter, signed by Arthur B. Culvahouse, counsel to the
president, and sent to Lugar on Thursday, said the resolution is
``seriously flawed.''
   He acknowledged that for domestic purposes a president would
adhere to an interpretation generally agreed to by the Senate, but
he said the proposed amendment would go too far, by binding an
administration to ``all statements made by official of the
executive branch during ratification proceedings.''
   These would include ``answers to over 1,000 questions submitted
by members of the Senate, no matter how trivial or how unimportant
the issue addressed may be to the Senate's advice and consent
deliberations.''
   ``The result might be two INF treaties, one binding domestically
against the president and a second one binding internationally
between the United States and the Soviet Union,'' Culvahouse said.
   He said the differences ``will favor the Soviet Union because
the Soviet Union is not and cannot be bound by our domestic
processes.''
   The proposal ``only serves the interests of confusion,
ambiguity, confrontation and uncertainty,'' he said.

   Backers of former state school
superintendent Carolyn Warner filed petitions Friday to put her on
the recall election ballot against impeached Gov. Evan Mecham,
setting up a possible seven-way race in the May 17 vote.
   More than 100 people took out petitions to run against the
first-term Republican governor, but only six came back with
signatures as Friday's filing deadline passed.
   Backers of Mrs. Warner, a Democrat who lost to Mecham in 1986,
filed what they said were about 6,500 signatures, well over the
total of 3,336 valid signatures required.
   Backers of acting Gov. Rose Mofford, another Democrat, and two
Republican hopefuls _ party national committeeman Jack Londen and
former congressman John Rhodes _ submitted signatures Thursday.
   Mecham is automatically on the ballot, unless the Senate's
impeachment trial ends before then with a vote to bar him from
public office.
   Two lesser-known candidates, one a real-estate broker with
little political experience and the other a member of the Socialist
Workers Party, also filed under the deadline.
   Under state law, the highest vote total wins the recall
election, even if it is less than a majority. Political
affiliations are not indicated on the ballot.
   Mecham was elected on his fifth try in a race against Mrs.
Warner and a Democrat running as an independent, Bill Schulz.
   Several candidates have said that a large number of candidates
in the May 17 election would boost Mecham's chances of retaining
office.
   State law requires that Mrs. Mofford, who was elected secretary
of state in 1986 and became acting governor when Mecham was
impeached last month, resign both posts if she is to campaign
openly for the governor's job.
   She has declined to say whether she would resign and run
actively.
   Warner campaign spokesman Dave Bolger said Mrs. Warner would not
run if Mrs. Mofford declared she would campaign actively.
   On the Republican side, Londen vowed to drop out if Mecham's
Senate impeachment trial results in acquittal. Rhodes said he would
stay in the race regardless of the outcome of the trial, which
wound up its third week Friday.
   Mecham is charged with obstructing justice, concealing a
$350,000 campaign loan and loaning $80,000 in state money to his
auto dealership.
   The other two candidates filing petitions were Tempe real-estate
broker John C. Oertle Sr. and and Socialist Workers Party candidate
Bernie Senter.

   The soldiers who left Fort Ord for
Honduras are members of the 7th Light Infantry Division, designed
for quick airlifts to any part of the world on short notice.
   Some members of the so-called Bayonet Division have been trained
in warfare in Saudi Arabia, the Sinai Desert, Korea, Panama and
Honduras.
   In October 1985, the 7th was incorporated into the military's
Rapid Deployment Force and became the Army's first modern light
division. It is one of four light infantry divisions in the Army;
the others are based in Hawaii, Alaska and New York.
   ``A light infantry division is designed for low- to
mid-intensity combat,'' said Capt. Guy Shields, Fort Ord spokesman.
   Shields said the entire Fort Ord division of 11,400 soldiers can
be moved in less than six days. A description of the 7th Light
issued by Fort Ord says ``initial combat elements can be in a
potential crisis area in less than 18 hours.''
   The description also calls the 7th Light ``an offensively
oriented, highly responsive combat division deployable three times
faster than existing infantry divisions.''
   The units at Fort Ord consist of nine infantry battalions. They
have fewer vehicles, less equipment and fewer soldiers than
standard infantry divisions, and thus are able to move faster, in
500 airlifts instead of about 1,200.
   In March 1986, 200 Fort Ord soldiers were sent to Honduras for
U.S. and Honduran military exercises known as Big Pine. They were
stationed near the Nicaraguan border about 100 miles from the site
of skirmishes between the Nicaraguan army and the Contras, and
practiced troop deployment.
   The Fort Ord troops brought some vehicles and personal weapons
such as M-16A1 rifles and sidearms, but were cautioned to avoid any
real combat.
   In March 1987, 750 soldiers from the division were sent to
Honduras for several weeks of field exercises with Honduran troops.

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
continued to hold a lead Friday as Washington state Democrats were
wrapping up their tally of results from precinct caucuses.
   With nearly complete results from five congressional districts,
Dukakis had won support from 3,784, or 44.6 percent, of the
delegates elected to county conventions, which will be held in
April. Jesse Jackson was supported by 3,083, or 36.3 percent, of
the county delegates and 1,074, or 12.7 percent, were uncommitted.
   Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois won support from 300 county
convention delegates, while 166 supported Tennessee Sen. Albert
Gore Jr. and 78 supported Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt.
   If these figures hold up through the congressional district
conventions next month, Dukakis will receive 14 delegates to the
Democratic National Convention this summer, Jackson will get nine
delegates and another five will be uncommitted.
   Washington Democrats met in party caucuses on March 8, but
results have not been available until now.
   The state party refused to release partial results from the
remaining three congressional districts. Those results are expected
next week.
   The precinct caucuses elected delegates to the county
conventions, where delegates to the conventions in each of the
state's eight congressional districts will be chosen. Those
conventions will pick a total of 43 national convention delegates,
and those delegates will meet later to choose another 22 delegates.
   In all, Washington state will send 73 delegates to the
Democratic National Convention, including 65 chosen through the
caucus process. In addition, Gov. Booth Gardner and seven
Democratic National Committee members from the state automatically
hold seats as delegates to the convention.

<HEAD>New Contra Aid Package Proposed, More Honduran Assistance
Discussed</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: New thruout with Honduras asking for U.S. help in ferrying
troops to front.</NOTE>

   Honduras asked for U.S. help Friday in
ferrying Honduran troops to the scene of their battle with
Sandinista forces, administration sources said, adding that the
request was likely to be approved.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
government of Honduras asked the United States for helicopter
support in moving some additional Honduran troops to an area within
about 20 miles of the border of Nicaragua where the fighting has
been going on.
   ``The cable came in to the State Department today. But no
decision has been made as yet,'' said an official who asked not to
be identified.
   But another official said, ``I can't imagine that we would turn
it down. We've done it before.''
   In December 1986, 40 U.S. helicopters were used to ferry
Honduran troops and equipment to the Nicaraguan border to repel a
Nicaraguan attack on Contra rebel camps on Honduran soil. The
transported 700 Honduran soldiers to the front, after Honduran
President Jose Azcona asked for the aid. No Americans became
involved in comba.
   The sources said a response to Honduras would probably come over
the weekend. They said the Honduras were not planning to move a
large number of troops, but they declined to give a number. They
said the United States has sufficient transport helicopters in
Honduras to do the job.
   The sources said that they would be following the same type of
rules as in l986 when they did this, in that U.S. personnel and
equipment would stay well away from the scene of fighting to ensure
they were not exposed to hostile fire.
   The request came as U.S. troops continued to arrive in Honduras
in a show of force, and a bipartisan group of 11 senators proposed
a $48 million package of new aid to Nicaragua's Contra rebels,
including renewed authority for the CIA to deliver previously
stockpiled weapons.
   Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams said earlier that
additional assistance was being discussed with Honduran President
Jose Azcona, in response to a reported Nicaraguan incursion.
   White House chief of staff Howard Baker said President Reagan
would give ``most careful'' consideration to any request from
Honduras for troops to help repel Nicaraguan forces, although he
reiterated that U.S. troops were not expected to be involved in any
military operation in the region.
   One of the Senate's leading peace advocates, Sen. Mark O.
Hatfield, said the sending of U.S. troops amounted merely to
``matching stupidity with stupidity'' and introduced legislation
barring the troops from a combat role without permission from
Congress.
   Sponsors of the new Contra aid proposal said they hoped it would
revive negotiations in Congress and with the Reagan administration
on an aid package that could be quickly enacted to replace supplies
lost or expended during the past week's heavy fighting along the
Nicaraguan-Honduran border.
   But the extent of the damage inflicted on the rebels by the
Sandinista incursion remained unclear. Sen. David Boren, D-Okla.,
chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the Nicaraguan
troops were withdrawing without accomplishing all their objectives.
   ``We think it's very important right now to send a signal to the
Sandinista government'' which allegedly crossed the border into
Honduras in an effort to destroy rebel camps and supplies, Boren
said.
   Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., said announcement of the package
also would strengthen the Contras as they enter direct cease-fire
talks with the Managua regime, scheduled for Monday. ``This is a
common-sense, moderate and reasoned approach,'' she said.
   The proposal would use $48 million in unspent Pentagon money to
buy food, clothing, shelter and medical supplies, and to transport
it to troops in the field, over the next year. About $3 million of
that amount would go for communications gear.
   But in what promised to be a controversial provision, the
package would allow the CIA to airdrop ammunition and weapons
previously stockpiled by the rebels to troops in the field. Boren
said the rebels still have $2 million to $5 million worth of
undelivered supplies, about half of them lethal.
   And it would give President Reagan the right to hold a quick,
guaranteed vote in Congress on any request for further military aid
under certain conditions if the peace talks between the Sandinistas
and Contras break down.
   As a ``carrot,'' the bill also would promise long-term economic
aid for the region once political stability is restored.
   An administration official, speaking on condition he not be
identified, said of the new aid package, ``We are encouraged from
reports we have heard about it, but we will have to wait until we
have the actual details.''
   Action on further aid for the rebels has been stalled since
March 3, when the House narrowly rejected a $30 million package of
purely humanitarian aid. Aid proponents saw the Sandinista
incursion into Honduras as a new opportunity to revive interest in
aid.
   Meanwhile, Abrams told reporters that American officials have
been discussing with Honduran President Azcona the possibility of
providing additional assistance to that country, in addition to the
3,200 troops already airlifted to Palmerola Air Base near
Tegucigalpa.
   ``There are some other possibilities that we've discussed,''
Abrams said, adding that the possibilities did not include
additional troops.
   Baker said that if a request were received from Honduras for
troops to help repel Nicaraguan forces, ``it would be most
carefully considered and most deliberately considered. But I cannot
tell you what decision the president would make under those
circumstances.''
   Baker, interviewed on the syndicated television program, ``John
McLaughlin's One on One,'' was asked at what point U.S. troops
would enter action.
   ``I don't anticipate that will occur at all. I think that the
Honduran forces can handle that on their own, and I fully
anticipate that either the Nicaraguans will retire on their own or
Honduras will, as they say, encourage them to do that. But I do not
expect American troops to be involved in any military operation
there,'' he said.
   Hatfield's proposal would permit U.S. military exercises in
Honduras, like the training mission which began Thursday, only if
Congress has been notified a month in advance. Troops could not be
sent into combat without a declaration of war or a ``clear and
present danger'' of attack on the United States or its citizens. It
also would prohibit any increase in the permanent U.S. military
presence there.
   He said the administration's action amounted to ``sinking to the
level of those in Nicaragua who have no interest in peace.''
   ``Under the terms of this legislation we will not allow and will
not tolerate sending American military personnel into combat in
Central America,'' Hatfield said. ``It is not an option... We will
not permit our young people to be used as pawns in this political
game. And we will not push them down the slippery slope of
intervention as we pushed their fathers and brothers down that
slope into Vietnam.''
   The senators who proposed the aid package included seven
Republicans and four Democrats. They are Boren; Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas; Bob Graham, D-Fla., Sam Nunn, D-Ga.; Richard Lugar,
R-Ind., Daniel Evans, R-Wash., Kassebaum, John McCain, R-Ariz.;
Phil Gramm, R-Texas; Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Frank Murkowski,
R-Alaska.

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The PLO envoy told an emergency General
Assembly session Friday the United Nations should file suit to keep
his mission open if the United States tries to close it.
   Some diplomats said the world body should consider fighting the
U.S. government in American courts and provide alternative
accommodations for the Palestine Liberation Organization on U.N.
international territory. The PLO has observer status at the United
Nations.
   PLO observer Zehdi Labib Terzi and other speakers denounced the
U.S. Justice Department decision to close the mission under a new
anti-terrorism act, saying the move conflicts with U.S. treaty
obligations to the United Nations. The U.S. State Department has
opposed the closure.
   The Justice Department says it will take legal action if the
mission is not closed by March 21, the effective date of the law.
It is not expected to be closed by Monday and litigation is
expected.
   Terzi said Israel also should be denied its place at the United
Nations if the mission is closed. The United Nations regards the
PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian
people, but Israel and the United States consider it a terrorist
organization.
   ``We deem it proper the General Assembly should ask the
secretary-general ... to take all steps, including legal steps if
necessary, to ensure the PLO observer mission be able to discharge
its official functions without hindrance,'' Terzi said.
   It was the second emergency session on the PLO issue this month
and the 159-member assembly is to consider draft resolutions
condemning the U.S. action. General Assembly resolutions carry the
moral weight of world opinion but are not binding on the
membership, as are those of the Security Council.

   At the same time, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State William
Walker has gone to Panama at Noriega's request to discuss possible
terms for his departure from Panama, the source said.
   According to the official, Walker had instructions to tell
Noriega that the United States will not seek his extradition on
drug trafficking charges if he flees to a third country.
   The official said that Walker went to Panama with this offer in
the hopes that it would facilitate Noriega's departure, thus
sparing the country a period of prolonged political upheaval,
including widespread suffering.
   The country has been virtually paralyzed economically for most
of the past two weeks.
   The government of Spain has said it would be wiling to admit
Noriega provided he requests political asylum and the United States
agrees not to seek his extradition.

<HEAD>Physically Fit Have Low Heart Disease Risk Even Without Exercising</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People who are moderately physically fit
have a lower risk of dying of a heart attack even if they don't
exercise, a new study shows.
   ``You don't have to be a super athlete. You don't have to have
extraordinary levels of fitness or physical activity to get the
benefit,'' said one of the study's directors, Steven Blair of the
Institute for Aerobics Research in Dallas.
   Blair described the study Friday during a meeting of the
American Heart Association.
   The study is one of the first to show that physical fitness _ as
measured by the length of time a subject can walk or run on a
treadmill _ protects against fatal heart attacks even in people who
don't exercise, Blair said.
   Physical fitness is a function of past exercise and genetics,
Blair said. Some people are simply born more fit than others, Blair
said.
   It is widely accepted that exercise or other forms of physical
activity protect against heart disease, and many studies have shown
that the protection extends even to those who engage in only
moderate physical activity.
   This study, of 3,120 women and 10,226 men who came to the Cooper
Clinic in Dallas for preventative health exams, extends that
observation to physical fitness itself.
   Blair's institute and the Cooper Clinic are both part of The
Aerobics Center, founded by Dr. Kenneth Cooper to encourage
exercise and physical fitness. The institute is the research arm of
The Aerobics Center.
   Blair and his collaborator, Harold Kohl III, found that men in
the bottom 20 percent when ranked by physical fitness were twice as
likely as the others to die of a heart attack.
   Women in the bottom 20 percent had 2.8 times the risk of other
women.
   The conclusions that can be reached by the study are limited by
the fact that the subjects were not a representative sample of the
American population, Blair said.
   Eighty percent were college graduates, they were virtually all
white and they were largely well-to-do, he said.
   In a standard treadmill test, a physically fit 40-year-old man
might be able to exercise for 20 or 25 minutes, Blair said. A
champion athlete could last more than half an hour, and people who
are not fit can become exhausted much sooner.

   Planeloads of U.S. soldiers began arriving at Palmerola Air Base
in Honduras to engage in joint exercises with Honduran troops.
President Reagan ordered the troops to Honduras in a show of
strength to counter what he called an invasion by Nicaraguan
forces. Nicaragua's Sandinista army was battling Contra rebels in
the border region.
   Two battalions from the 82nd Airborne Division of Fort Bragg,
N.C. and two battalions from the 7th Light Infantry Division of
Fort Ord, Calif., were combined into a task force of 3,000 troops
deployed about 125 miles west of the reported fighting.

   Nicaragua said warplanes attacked a Sandinista military
headquarters in northern Nicaragua near the Honduran border. A
Reagan administration source in Washington confirmed that Honduras
had launched the raid.
   A Nicaraguan spokesman said the planes fired at least five
rockets but there were no injuries or damage. He said Sandinista
troops fired on the planes, forcing them to turn back.

<HEAD>NICARAGUA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In Managua, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega called for a
meeting of the U.N. Security Council to deal with what he called
``one more escalation of the war against Nicaragua.''
   Ortega said the Sandinistas would continue their offensive
against the Contra rebels. ``We are ready to combat and liquidate
the famous forces of the 82nd Airborne Division,'' he said.
   Earlier, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Nicaragua already had
begun withdrawing troops from the border region after driving about
2,000 Contra rebels back into Honduras.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HONDURAS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Col. Manuel Suarez Benavides, spokesman for the Honduran armed
forces, said the government and the army had given Nicaragua ``a
peremptory deadline'' of 24 hours to withdraw 2,000 troops from
Honduras.
   Honduran military intelligence sources said about 4,000 Honduran
soldiers were still surrounding about 2,000 Nicaraguan troops. The
armed forces spokesman said the troops were six miles inside
Honduras.
   ``We will not allow the Sandinistas to move further into the
interior of our territory,'' said one Honduras military source.
``We want to avoid a large conflict, but if it isn't possible, we
will have to face the invading troops.''

<HEAD>REAGAN ADMINISTRATION</HEAD>

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said the U.S. troops
airlifted to Central America are not there in a ``shooting
capacity'' but to signal opposition to Nicaraguan aggression. He
told a Senate committee the intent was to ``get people's attention
to what is happening in Central America'' and to say to the
Honduran government, ``We are your friends. We stand with you.''
   ``It is important for people to know the United States will
fight, but we don't plan to get involved in any military way,''
Shultz said.

   Some Democrats in Congress quickly questioned President Reagan's
decision to send the troops. Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd
Jr., D-W. Va., called it an ``overreaction,'' and House Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas, said it was unjustified.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas defended the action,

   ABC News reported Friday night that unidentified U.S. and
Central American sources say Noriega has signed off on most parts
of a package that will allow some face-saving for him, but will get
him out of office and out of Panama.
   The United States has applied economic pressure, including
blocking the transfer of currency to Panama and withholding Panama
Canal fees, in an attempt to encourage the ouster of Noriega. The
political opposition has sought to get rid of the de facto leader
of Panama for months.
   The United States stepped up its actions against Noriega after
Noriega deposed President Eric Arturo Delvalle on Feb. 25. Delvalle
had tried to fire Noriega. The United States still recognizes
Delvalle, although Solis Palma was officially installed Feb. 26.
   ABC reported that as a condition of Noriega's departure, he will
never go to jail and will be allowed to retain most of his wealth.
   According to ABC, the deal included that Noriega will step down
with full honors; several days or weeks later, he will leave
Panama, going either to Spain or France. In addition, ABC said,
opposition leaders in Panama have agreed not to seek criminal
charges against Noriega there and not to try to get any of his
money held in overseas accounts.

   The army on Friday began moving
2,000 soldiers to border jungles it says Nicaraguan troops have
penetrated, and President Jose Azcona Hoyo said he was depending on
U.S. support to fend off agression from Nicaragua.
   Reagan administration sources said Friday that Honduras had
asked for U.S. help in transporting the troops to the border area.
The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the request
for helicopter support would probably be approved.
   Honduras said the Nicaraguans crossed the border in pursuit of
U.S.-backed Contra rebels, and a ranking officer said Friday that
about 1,000 of the soldiers remained on Honduran territory.
   At a news conference Friday, Azcona said the U.S. deployment of
more than 3,000 troops in Honduras was a warning and he would ask
for more U.S. help if the leftist Nicaraguan government didn't
withdraw its troops.
   The U.S. Embassy said about 800 American paratroopers, the last
of the 3,200 troops sent to Honduras, were dropped onto Palmerola
air base Friday. The Defense Department says the troops will be in
Central America about 10 days.
   Azcona said his own troops will keep bombing Sandinista
positions if the Nicaraguans do not withdraw.
   ``We are preparing an operation to bomb inside Honduran
territory,'' he said the day after an air raid in the Bocay region.
   Azcona said he decided to ask for U.S. troops because their
arrival would be ``spectacular.'' He said he expected the ``simple
presence and immediate response'' of U.S. troops would scare the
Sandinista troops into withdrawing.
   The United States helped Honduras move troops to the border in
December 1986, after Nicaraguan forces attacked Contra rebel camps
in Honduras. Forty U.S. helicopters transported 700 Honduran
soldiers to the front. No Americans were involved in combat.
   The Reagan administration sources said that if the request for
helicopter support was granted, U.S. personnel would stay away from
any fighting.
   Nicaragua has denied its troops entered Honduras, but a
Nicaraguan military source indicated Friday that they had.
   The 60-year-old Azcona said Honduran infantry was moving into
the mountainous Bocay region and should be in position by Saturday.
   ``We're acting with complete calm. The Sandinistas only have to
leave our territory,'' Azcona told a news conference.
   The Honduran officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
two infantry battalions totaling from 1,600 to 2,000 soldiers were
moving in from a base at Juticalpa, about 90 miles west of Bocay.
He said warplanes were on call from Tamara air base 15 miles north
of Tegucigalpa.
   The officer said soldiers had orders to expel ``invading
troops'' by whatever means necessary, adding that about half the
original force had fled back to Nicaragua and about 1,000 remained.
   He said the remaining Sandinista troops were spread over an area
about 40 miles square.
   Pentagon officials said privately the four U.S. battalions from
the 82nd Airborne and 7th Light Infantry would spend eight or nine
days training with Hondurans in different parts of the country.
   One battalion of the 82nd Airborne will be at Juticalpa, one
official said, ``but anyone who knows the country'' would realize
the 90 miles ``might as well be 4,000. There's nothing but
mountains and jungle in between.''
   ``The basic order that these troops aren't to get near the
fighting still stands,'' he said.
   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua said Thursday his soldiers
were ready to ``combat and liquidate'' the 82nd Airborne and would
continue the offensive against Contra rebels in an area reaching
from central Nicaragua to the border.
   Alejandro Bendana, secretary-general of Nicaragua's Foreign
Ministry, said ``one step ... could lead to another'' in the border
conflict, indicating war might result.
   The Contras have had secret bases in Honduras from which to
attack across the border in their 6-year-old battle with the
Sandinistas.
   Nicaragua's northern military headquarters is in San Andres de
Bocay near the frontier and Honduran warplanes flew raids in the
area Thursday, hours after U.S. troops began arriving.
   Azcona said the planes fired rockets on a dirt airstrip in
Honduras ``used by Nicaraguan helicopters.'' He would not confirm
U.S. reports that a Soviet-made helicopter was destroyed. The
Sandinistas denied it.
   Reporters flown from Nicaragua to San Andres de Bocay saw two
unidentified jets fly in from Honduras Thursday and drop at least
five bombs near the border.

   President Reagan would give ``most careful''
consideration to any request from Honduras for U.S. troops to
assist in repelling Nicaraguan forces, White House Chief of Staff
Howard H. Baker Jr. said Friday.
   Interviewed on the television program, ``John McLaughlin's One
on One,'' Baker said, however, that he does not expect U.S. troops
to be used in any military engagements in the region.
   The presidential aide defended Reagan's decision to send U.S.
troops into the area and denied that the United States had put
pressure on the Honduran government to request them.
   He said the president made the decision ``in the second floor of
the residence portion of the White House a minute after 8:00'' on
Wednesday evening, after receiving a request from Honduran
President Jose Azcona.
   ``I do not believe there was any effort, any arm-twisting, to
try to contrive a situation where he would make this request,''
Baker said. ``I think it was made for the reason stated in this
letter: His country was invaded and that he wanted help.''
   Interviewer John McLaughlin asked Baker what the president would
do if Azcona asked him to have U.S. troops join Honduran troops
``in combat, to repel the invaders.''
   ``No such request has been received. I do not believe such a
request will be received,'' Baker said. ``But were it received, to
answer your hypothetical question, were it to be received, it would
be most carefully considered and most deliberately considered. But
I cannot tell you what decision the president would make under
those circumstances.''
   When asked at what point U.S. troops would enter action, Baker
said, ``I don't anticipate that will occur at all. I think that the
Honduran forces can handle that on their own, and I fully
anticipate that either the Nicaraguans will retire on their own or
Honduras will, as they say, encourage them to do that. But I do not
expect American troops to be involved in any military operation
there.''
   Baker rejected suggestions that the administration had raised
the alarm about the Nicaraguan border crossing in order to
strengthen its hand in seeking renewed assistance from Congress for
rebels fighting Nicaragua's Marxist-led government.
   ``It was not our design,'' he said. ``It did not work that way.
And we did not want it that way.''
   In fact, Baker said, he thinks prospects for an agreement on aid
to the rebels were better on Tuesday, before the crisis arose, than
they are now.
   ``I think we were on the brink of that until this incursion
occurred, and until we received this request from Azcona,'' he
said. ``After that, there's dust in the air and fur flying, and
clearly we are not better off now than we were before.''
   He also said, however, that he believes the prospects will
improve again after ``the dust settles and people think about it
and understand what's happened, and stop imputing bad motives to
this administration and this president.''
   ``But if that was our design, it was the dumbest legislative
strategy ever devised, because it hasn't worked that way,'' he said.
   The program was taped for weekend broadcast, and a transcript
was distributed for release on Friday.
   On other subjects, Baker said:
   _That when he went to Panama as Senate Republican leader during
the debate on the Panama Canal Treaties, Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, who was then the Panamanian intelligence chief, threatened
in a conversation to blow up the canal if the treaties were not
ratified. He said Omar Torrijos, then the Panamanian strongman,
told him, ``Look, Noriega's sort of a hot-head, don't pay any
attention to him.''
   But Baker said the administration, which is putting pressure on
Noriega to step down, has not had direct contact with the
Panamanian leader. He was asked about reports that Noriega wants
direct contacts with the United States but that the United States
will not agree to those talks until he agrees to leave Panama.
   ``There have been some contacts that would appear to be from
Gen. Noriega or on his behalf, but that's all I can tell you ...
They purport to be ... queries by _ on Gen. Noriega's part _ but we
have not (had) direct contact with Gen. Noriega,'' Baker said.
   Baker made his remarks before other administration officials
revealed late Friday that a U.S. envoy has gone to Panama at
Noriega's request to discuss terms of his possible departure.
   _On possible pardons for individuals indicted in the Iran-Contra
affair, ``The president's simply not going to address that
question. The president has the constitutional pardoning authority,
but he's said over and over, this is not the time and it's not the
circumstance in which to consider that.''
   _He does not expect Vice President George Bush, assuming Bush is
the Republican presidential nominee, to ask him to be his running
mate. ``I think he needs to go to a governor, perhaps, someone who
can bring about a balance to the ticket.'' He said possibilities
would include Govs. George Deukmejian of California, Tom Kean of
New Jersey, and former Govs. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and
Richard Thornburgh of Pennsylvania.

<HEAD>Law Outlines Taxes for Cooperative Workers</HEAD>

   Soviets who earn $3,200 or more a month working in
a cooperative operating outside state control will have to pay more
than half the money back in taxes, and even as much as 90 percent,
Izvestia said Friday.
   The government newspaper outlined progressive income taxes for
members of cooperatives that it said will go into effect April 1.
   Taxes will remain low for the cooperatives themselves, but
income taxes for those who earn more than 500 rubles ($800) a month
from working in the cooperatives will climb steeply, according to
an interview Izvestia conducted with Finance Ministry official Y.
Zemskov.
   Zemskov said taxes will be increased on high salaries because
cooperatives in those cases are paying out in salaries what the
government would like them to spend improving and expanding their
services.
   Under Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms, Soviets can get permission
to form cooperatives to produce goods and provide services outside
the state-run economy. The cooperatives must be approved by local
governments, but otherwise operate outside state control.
   The tax rate now is between 2 percent and 3 percent for
cooperatives in their first year and up to 10 percent after their
third year.
   Taxes of cooperative members will start going up sharply after
an income of 500 rubles a month, Zemskov said. The tax on an income
of 1,000 rubles, ($1,600) will be 270.20 rubles and on an income of
2,000 rubles ($3,200) will be 53.5 percent.
   He said the tax eventually reaches 90 percent, but did not say
what the income threshold was for that tax.
   Zemskov said local governments will be allowed to keep the money
levied in income taxes on cooperatives to provide them with an
incentive to help cooperatives develop.

   Crew members of a high-tech, 28-foot rowboat that
crossed the treacherous strait between South America and Antarctica
said Friday they encountered squalls that tossed three of them into
the turbulent sea.
   ``Why did we do it?'' said Jay Morrison, 34. ``Because nobody
had ever done it before. That's a pretty good reason.''
   Rowing most of the way, Morrison and three colleagues crossed
the stormy Drake Passage between Tierra del Fuego, the southern tip
of South America, and Antactica in a 600-mile voyage that ended
March 7.
   ``You should see what it's like to try to walk on land after
being thrown around at sea for 12 days,'' said Ned Gillette, who
organized the voyage and led an similar expedition last year that
was scuttled by ice.
   ``Until we made it, we weren't really sure it could be done,''
said Gillette, of Stowe, Vt. ``I didn't think we'd expire on the
trip, but I didn't know where we'd end up.''
   The expedition in the $17,000 red boat jokingly dubbed the Sea
Tomato mixed raw adventure with high-technology precision. The
expedition was financed by corporate sponsors.
   While crew members bailed flooded cabins and rowed the boat
through 100-foot swells, a Massachusetts weather station each day
fed the expedition forecasts, and the boat's location was tracked
by satellite.
   After waiting nearly a month for proper weather, the expedition
almost ended in disaster off the Chilean coast Feb. 22, just hours
after leaving under sail.
   A heavy squall erupted and swamped the craft, sending Gillette
overboard. Gillette, an experienced moutaineer, was saved by a line
fastened to the boat, as were two other crew members who were
washed overboard later in the trip.
   Three days out, the crew took down the sails and began rowing in
shifts, sometimes all night. They went about 2.6 mph on average, or
about as fast as a person walks.
   ``Sometimes an albatross would land alongside,'' said Gillette.
``It would paddle along and watch us. We would outdistance it _
sometimes.''
   The team brought provisions for 25 days. ``We didn't know how
long we'd be out,'' said Gillette. ``There was a lot of
uncertainty.''
   The Sea Tomato, stripped of some expensive equipment, now rests
on King George Island in Antarctica as a gift to the Chilean
government.
   ``I kind of hope they leave it there,'' said Gillette. ``It did
its job to get us there. It would be fitting it keep it there.''

<HEAD>Sumgait Officials Fired; Police Raid Glasnost Office</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES thruout with raid on magazine; no pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mayor and the Communist Party chief of a city
in Azerbaijan where at least 32 people died in ethnic rioting were
fired Thursday, reports from Soviet Armenia said.
   Those dismissed were said to be the mayor and Communist Party
chief of Sumgait, Azerbaijan, where riots broke out Feb. 28 between
Azerbaijanis and ethnic Armenians.
   In another development, the editor of Glasnost magazine reported
a police raid Thursday he said was linked to the publication's
coverage of ethnic violence in Armenia and neighboring Azerbaijan.
   Sergei Grigoryants, a former political prisoner and editor of
Glasnost, said six carloads of police descended on the office in
Kratovo, a town about 15 miles southeast of Moscow.
   He said by telephone that uniformed and plainclothes officers
spent more than two hours checking editors' papers and taking
photographs.
   Grigoryants said they wanted to search the office but did not
have a warrant. The five editors present would not let police into
the back half of the office where editorial work is done, he said.
   ``The house was completely surrounded by police cars,''
Grigoryants said, adding that many police were involved. He said
they did not detain anyone or take anything from the office.
   Grigoryants founded Glasnost, named for Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's policy of more openness, last June and has
unsuccessfully sought official approval for it.
   Gamlet Kocharyan, a member of the governing council of the
Kafar, Armenia, said by telephone the dismissals at Sumgait were
announced in a television broadcast from Yerevan, capital of the
Armenian republic.
   Armenian activists say the victims in Sumgait were Armenians
killed by Azeris, the dominant group in neighboring Azerbaijan.
Most Azeris are Shiite Moslems and Armenians are predominantly
Christian.
   Unrest in the southern republics began with Armenian
demonstrations pressing for Nagorno-Karabakh, an area of Azerbaijan
that has an Armenian majority, to be annexed by Armenia.
   Kocharyan identified the men fired as Muslim Zade, Communist
Party chief in Sumgait, and Mayor Tavakkula Yagub Ogly Mamedov.
   The report said they would be replaced by the premier of the
Nakhichevansky autonomous republic in Azerbaijan and a factory
manager from Sumgait, according to Kocharyan.
   Baku radio reported earlier that Mamedov was fired for ``serious
shortcomings in the work of maintaining appropriate law and order
and discipline in the city, and for the lack of political foresight
he has shown which has resulted in tragic consequences.''
   The television report also said a commission had been formed to
search for witnesses to the rioting in Sumgait, Kocharyan said.
   Grigoryants is Armenian and has reported regularly to Western
correspondents in Moscow about the ethnic unrest in Armenia and
Azerbaijan.
   He traveled to Yerevan to witness a memorial procession March 8
for those killed in Sumgait. He and fellow editor Andrei Shelkov,
who went to Sumgait, held a news conference last Friday for foreign
journalists who have not been permitted to visit the area.
   According to Grigoryants, the police visit to the Glasnost
offices was ``undoubtedly'' part of a campaign of reprisals against
him.
   On Saturday, Shelkov was attacked on a Moscow trolley bus by a
person who could not be identified, Grigoryants said.
   Official Soviet media have criticized Grigoryants. Police made
two raids in August on the editorial office, but did not take
anything or arrest anyone.
   In October, police confiscated about 70 copies they said were
printed illegally on state-owned equipment.

   Here is a summary of the latest developments Friday involving
Nicaragua, Honduras and the United States:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HONDURAS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Honduran army began moving about 2,000 soldiers into the
border jungles with orders to drive out Nicaraguans still on the
Honduran side. Honduran officials said the Nicaraguan troops had
crossed the border in pursuit of U.S.-backed Contra rebels and that
about 1,000 remained in Honduran territory.
   Honduras gave the Sandinistas 24 hours to get their soldiers out
of the country, but the ultimatum did not say when the time period
began.

<HEAD>U.S. FORCES:</HEAD>

   The U.S. Embassy said about 800 American paratroopers were
dropped onto Palmerola air base Friday morning. They are among
3,200 American troops sent to Honduras. The Defense Department says
the U.S. troops likely will be in Central America for about 10 days.
   Reagan Administration sources said Honduras asked the United
States Friday for helicopter support in ferrying Honduran troops to
the border area. The sources said the request was likely to be
approved. White House chief of staff Howard Baker said President
Reagan would give ``most careful'' consideration to any request
from Honduras for troops to help repel Nicaraguan forces.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>UNITED NATIONS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Nicaragua told the United Nations Security Council that U.S.
troops were sent to Honduras to create a crisis to justify military
action against Nicaragua. The United States countered that the
troop movement was ``a measured response'' in support of the
territorial integrity of Honduras.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar was studying
Nicaragua's request to send an observer team to its border with
Honduras on a fact-finding mission.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CONGRESS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A bipartisan group of senators proposed a $48 million package of
new aid to the Contras, including renewed authority for the CIA to
deliver previously stockpiled weapons.
   Supporters said the proposal was designed to trigger
negotiations in Congress and aimed at quick passage of an emergency
infusion of aid to replace supplies lost or expended during the
past week's heavy fighting.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>NICARAGUA:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Nicaragua said it had called off its offensive to roust Contra
rebels from camps along the Honduran border, but was maintaining
combat positions. The Defense Ministry maintained no Nicaraguan
troops had crossed the border, but a military source indicated
privately they had.
   The Sandinista government continued plans for cease-fire talks
with the Contras next Monday, but the rebels were considering a
boycott.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>AMERICANS PROTEST:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   More than 300 people were arrested in demonstrations around the
United States to protest the deployment of Army troops in Honduras.
The arrests were mostly for blocking traffic or disorderly conduct.

   A former Wedtech Corp. executive testified
Friday that he was told Attorney General Edwin Meese III interceded
with the Pentagon on the defense contractor's behalf over a $24
million Navy contract.
   The allegation came at the racketeering trial of Rep. Mario
Biaggi and six others charged in a series of bribery and influence
peddling schemes involving Wedtech.
   The government's first witness, ex-Wedtech official Mario
Moreno, said he met with a close friend of Meese, San Francisco
lawyer E. Robert Wallach, in December 1983. Meese at the time was
presidential counselor.
   Moreno said Wedtech had been notified it would be awarded the
less lucrative part of a Navy contract to build bridge pontoons,
and he asked Wallach to get Meese ``to change the Navy's mind.''
   Moreno said Wallach told him, ``Mr. Meese said he would talk to
Mr. Weinberger,'' referring to then-Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger. Moreno testified that he understood Weinberger would
call then-Navy Secretary John Lehman.
   Moreno said that in January 1984, Wedtech received approval
making it eligible for the entire pontoon contract, which it signed
in April 1984.
   Moreno first described Meese's alleged intervention in an
affidavit disclosed in October at a Senate hearing. At the time,
Meese and Weinberger said through spokesmen they had no
recollection of the action described by Moreno.
   Moreno previously testified at the Wedtech trial that Wallach
told him that Meese had also interceded on Wedtech's behalf with
the Commerce Department over a federal financing package.
   Wedtech, a $100 million-a-year defense contractor before
declaring bankruptcy in 1986, grew from a small New York machine
shop through a series of no-bid defense contracts. Prosecutors
claim Wedtech falsely portrtayed itself as a minority company to
get contracts.
   Wallach, Meese's former personal lawyer, is under indictment on
charges of taking bribes from Wedtech officials for trying to
influence Meese and others.
   In December, a special prosecutor in Washington said there was
insufficient evidence to charge Meese in the Wedtech case.
   Moreno is one of four ex-Wedtech officials who have pleaded
guilty to bribing public officials and to other crimes.

   The United States and Honduras told the
Security Council Friday that Nicaraguan troops had invaded
Honduras. Nicaragua claimed the sending of U.S. troops to Honduras
signaled a plot for direct U.S. military action against Nicaragua.
   Nicaraguan envoy Rita Delia Casco denied Sandinista troops
entered Honduran territory. ``What they have said is mere lies,''
said Ms. Casco, the Foreign Ministry's director of international
organizations.
   ``We (Nicaraguans) can't withdraw from Nicaragua,'' she told a
news conference after the emergency session ended. ``The military
actions we have taken are limited to the defense of our territory
and sovereignty.''
   The council adjourned without a resolution or a vote and was to
decide whether to resume discussions at some future date.
   Nicaragua's Sandinista government had asked for the meeting to
protest the sending of 3,200 U.S. military personnel to Honduras
Thursday and Friday.
   Ms. Casco said a U.S. congressional delegation was welcome to
visit Nicaragua and would be escorted to key border areas to see
the situation.
   After denouncing the United States in an address to the council,
Ms. Casco shook hands and chatted with U.S. Ambassador Herbert S.
Okun, who had accused Nicaragua of invading Honduras and rejecting
democracy.
   Okun, deputy chief of the U.S. mission, said sending U.S. troops
for military exercises in Honduras was a measured response
requested by the Honduran government.
   The U.S. force ``does not constitute either a threat or the use
of force against Nicaragua,'' he said.
   Okun also claimed the Santinistas were trying to destroy
U.S.-backed rebels, known as Contras, and stifle democratic debate.
Many of the rebels operate from bases in Honduras, which borders
Nicaragua.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar is considering a
Nicaraguan request to send a fact-finding mission, coordinated with
the Organization of American States, to the Nicaraguan-Honduran
border.
   Honduran Ambassador Jorge Ramon Hernandez told the council: ``If
Nicaragua withdraws the troops which even today are in Honduras,
that would be proof of its commitment to peace.
   ``We denounce this invasion as the expansionistic, aggressive
attitude of Nicaragua, not only to my country but to others. It is
trying to disrupt the whole, regional peace process.''
   He accused Nicaragua of launching a ``broad-ranging offensive in
flagrant violation of Honduran territorial integrity'' and said
Honduras had requested U.S. assistance.
   Ms. Casco claimed the Reagan administration created an
artificial crisis and was out to justify direct military action
against Nicaragua.
   Okun said sending the troops was ``a measured response designed
to show our staunch support for the democratic government of
Honduras at a time when its territorial integrity is being violated
by the Sandinista army.''
   He said the U.S. troops would be involved in exercises away from
the area of border hostilities.
   Ms. Casco told the council Washington wants to sabotage Central
American cease-fire talks and the peace plan signed in August by
the presidents of five Central American countries. The plan calls
for an end to outside aid to insurgents.
   ``This is a crisis artificially created by the U.S.
administration in its design to find justification for the
continuation and extension of its warlike policy in Central
America,'' she said.
   ``The U.S. administration has considered a series of options,
including the possibility of direct military action against
Nicaragua in order to save its mercenaries (the rebels) who have
been strategically defeated _ politically and militarily.''
   In asking for the meeting, Nicaragua's acting ambassador, Julio
Icaza Gallard, said the 15-member council should ``consider the
serious situation created by the escalation of threats and
aggression against my country and by the U.S. decision to send
American troops to Honduran territory.''
   Council members are the United States, Britain, China, France
and the Soviet Union, which as permanent members have veto power,
and Yugoslavia, Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Italy, Japan, Nepal,
Senegal, West Germany and Zambia.

<HEAD>Child Was Stillborn; No Murder Charges To Be Filed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A father told police he stuffed his
newborn baby into a toilet and later threw him into a lake, but
authorities concluded the child had died in the womb and said no
murder charges will be filed.
   However, the case has prompted several tips about pregnant women
whose newborns have vanished, and detectives are opening
investigations into three cases as a result, said Tarrant County
sheriff's Detective Wayne Boggus.
   The so-called Benbrook Lake case was solved by a tip from an
acquaintance of the mother, authorities said. The acquaintance
never saw the baby after the mother's pregnancy ended.
   Sheriff's investigators confronted the 22-year-old mother and
24-year-old husband and they gave detailed statements. The couple's
names were withheld.
   The woman gave birth Feb. 16 in her bathroom. The frightened
husband, apparently unaware the child was stillborn, stuffed the
body into the toilet and took a nap next to his bloodied wife, the
father told police Wednesday.
   ``He said when he woke up, he hoped it was all just a
nightmare,'' said Boggus. The father said he found the baby dead,
and he put the body in a bag with heavy rocks and tossed it into
lake, Boggus said.
   The man's wife, still weak, did not knew what was in the bag,
the man said. It was two weeks before he told her what he did with
the baby, authorities said.
   ``The only explanation we got from him was that he `freaked
out,''' Boggus said. ``He said he almost fainted himself. I assume
he was pretty scared and confused.''
   A fisherman hooked the bag March 7 in a nearby creek. On March
8, the county Medical Examiner's Office ruled that the baby was
choked by his umbilical cord in the womb.
   With the natural-death ruling, murder charges cannot be brought
against the couple, Robert Hester, assistant Tarrant County
prosecutor, said Thursday.
   Hester said authorities may charge the man with abuse of a
corpse, a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum of a year in jail and
a $2,000 fine.
   Because of a plea through the news media for information on the
Benbrook Lake case, detectives are looking into other cases. Police
declined to give details of those cases.

   Government radio condemned border air
raids by Honduras, which it said struck inside Nicaragua, and
exhorted listeners Friday against ``American imperialism and the
threat of military intervention.''
   A headline in Barricada, the Sandinista newspaper, said: ``The
Order Of The Day: Intensify Combat.''
   Honduras said the raids Thursday were confined to its own
territory, aimed at Nicaraguan soldiers it said crossed the
frontier the day before in pursuit of rebels known as Contras.
   Reagan administration officials said a Nicaraguan helicopter was
destroyed in the raid, but Nicaragua denied it.
   However, a Defense Ministry spokesman said Friday that rebel
anti-aircraft fire hit a Sandinista helicopter Thursday near San
Andres de Bocay, the region bombed by Honduras. He did not not
elaborate.
   Later Friday, Maj. Rosa Pasos, the chief Defense Ministry
spokeswoman, called The Associated Press to deny any helicopter had
been hit in the region.
   The Sandinista government continued with plans for cease-fire
talks with the Contras next Monday, but the U.S.-supported rebels
were considering a boycott.
   Cease-fires in the region's civil wars, and a ban on the use of
one country's territory for attacks on another, are provisions of
the peace plan signed Aug. 7 by the five Central American
presidents.
   Nicaragua said it had called off its offensive to drive Contras
from camps along the Honduran border Wednesday but was maintaining
combat positions.
   Although the Defense Ministry said none of the soldiers entered
Honduras, a Nicaraguan military source indicated privately that
they had.
   Honduran officials and the Reagan administration say Sandinista
soldiers crossed the rugged, ill-defined border about 175 miles
from Managua.
   On Thursday, the United States started flying 3,200 soldiers of
the 82nd Airborne Division and 7th Light Infantry to Honduras in a
show of support. Defense Secretary said they would be on a training
exercise there for 10 days but would stay out of combat.
   President Daniel Ortega said Nicaraguan troops would take on the
Americans if necessary.
   He hedged the question of whether Nicaraguan soldiers crossed
the Coco River in the isolated northern region, as he has when
previous incursions were reported.
   ``Here the question is not if army troops penetrated Honduran
territory or not, but that we have dozens of camps of mercenary
forces in Honduran territory ... tolerated by the Honduran
government,'' he said Thursday.
   Journalists taken to the area earlier Thursday saw and felt a
bomb explode at the confluence of the Bocay and Coco rivers. Lt.
Col. Javier Carrion, commander of the offensive against the
Contras, said two bombs fell in Nicaraguan territory and one on the
Honduran side.
   Carrion told reporters in a jungle clearing at San Andres de
Bocay that 4,500 soldiers were involved in the sweep through an
area running from central Nicaragua to the frontier. He said they
had air support from Soviet-supplied helicopter gunships and An-26
propeller-driven planes carrying bombs.
   He said Sandinista troops had killed 92 Contras and wounded 300,
at the cost of 34 soldiers dead and 68 wounded.
   The colonel said the purpose was to destroy Contra bases in the
border area, which is about 40 miles from an important mining
region the rebels attacked in December.
   The Defense Ministry said 17 soldiers and 15 rebels were killed
between Tuesday and Friday in fighting in the central province of
Matagalpa, in Zelaya on the Caribbean coast and Jinotega, where San
Andres de Bocay is located.
   Civilian sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity for
security reasons, said 17 soldiers were killed and eight wounded in
two clashes Friday in the central province of Chontales. Six rebels
were killed, they said.
   Honduras said about 2,000 Nicaraguan soldiers crossed the
border, and a high-ranking military officer said about half of them
still were there Friday.

Departure</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government controlled by Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega declared a state of emergency throughout
Panama Friday, but the opposition responded with a call for an
indefinite general strike.
   The emergency decree appeared aimed at forcing reopening of
banks and other businesses, closed for three weeks during an
economic and political crisis that has brought Panama to the brink
of bankruptcy.
   In Washington, sources in the Reagan administration said William
Walker, a deputy assistant secretary of state for Latin American
affairs, had gone to Panama to discuss possible terms for the
military strongman's departure.
   One official, who spoke on condition he remain anonymous, said
Walker would tell Noriega the United States will not seek his
extradition on drug trafficking charges if he seeks asylum in a
third country. Noriega says he is innocent of all charges.
   Spain has been mentioned as a possible place of refuge for
Noriega.
   Friday's emergency decree, technically called a ``state of
urgency'' by Panama's Constitution, permits the government to
suspend a wide range of civil liberties, including freedom of
speech and assembly and the right to private property. It was seen,
however, more as a maneuver to get the banks to reopen.
   The National Civic Crusade, a coalition of opposition groups
seeking Noriega's ouster, said it was calling a general strike as
of Monday ``to put a halt to the catastrophic national situation.''
   Aurelio Barria, foremost leader of the Crusade, also
acknowledged receiving a message from Noriega through a third party
seeking ``a Panamanian solution'' to the crisis.
   He and other Crusade leaders declined to give details. They said
they would not negotiate with Noriega ``because he is a liar and
cannot be trusted.''
   Panama's nominal civilian chief of state, Manuel Solis Palma,
said Friday the government declared the emergency because ``there
is a real situation of undeclared war'' against Panama by the
United States and by political foes at home.
   The emergency does not automatically suspend civil rights, but
gives the government the right to do so by decree. A government
spokesman said measures to implement Friday's decree ``will follow
in due time.''
   Luis H. Moreno, a former member of the National Banking
Commission, said he was sure the emergency was aimed at forcing
reopening of the 118 foreign and locally owned banks that make
Panama a major financial center.
   He told The Associated Press, ``I think that's the only reason
for the decree.''
   The communique said, ``Panama is the object of an attack on its
economy by the United States in coordination with national
political groups desperate to grab the government by force.''
   In other developments Friday:
   _Angry dockworkers moved huge blockades across the entrance to
Balboa port near the Panama Canal to fight off an army takeover by
troops loyal to Noriega.
   _Noriega fired his intelligence chief and four other officers in
an apparent purge of his fractured Defense Forces, two days after a
coup attempt against him failed.
   _The Pentagon said Panamanian authorities arrested four U.S.
military police officers in the capital and held them several
hours. The newspaper Critica said the Americans were carrying
handguns and ``military implements'' when detained in an area
``where daily activities disturbing the public order'' had occurred.
   The government blamed the closing of the banks on the
``arbitrary freezing of funds of the National Bank of Panama'' on
deposit in the United States.
   About $50 million in official Panamanian funds have been tied up
in legal actions brought by attorneys for Eric Arturo Delvalle, who
was deposed as president by Noriega Feb. 26. Delvalle, ousted after
he tried to fire Noriega, still is recognized as president by the
United States.
   The United States has cut off all economic and military aid to
Panama and applied other economic sanctions, including withholding
of $6.5 million in monthly Panama Canal fees due this week.
   Panama was last under a state of emergency less than a year ago.
   It decreed that emergency on June 10 after the government's foes
staged demonstrations aimed at Noriega's ouster. It was lifted on
June 29.
   The next day, a pro-Noriega mob attacked the U.S. Embassy in
Panama City, stoning it and splashing it with red paint as police
stood by.
   Under the state of emergency, the government can jail citizens
indefinitely without formal charge, search their homes without
warrants, open their mail and restrict their travel.
   Moreno said bankers and the banking commission have been trying
for more than two weeks to reach agreement on a plan to reopen the
banks, which were closed by a government order March 3. Many closed
their doors days earlier fearing a run on deposits.
   ``The problem is one of lack of confidence ...,'' Moreno said.
``If the government forces the banks to reopen, the banks will not
have enough cash to cover the demand for withdrawals.''
   Friday's communique also blamed Panamanian business groups for
the economic crisis, accusing them of hoarding currency, closing
shops and raising prices.
   In Washington, an administration official, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said two Panamanian pilots defected to the United
States Thursday. He also said Noriega received military equipment
from Cuba and money from Libya recently. He presented no evidence
and the report could not be confirmed.
   The failure of the cash-starved Panamanian government to pay its
workers has led to violent demonstrations.
   Panamanians lined up at public parks and pay stations Friday to
receive partial payment and bags of food from the government.
   At Balboa Port, about a mile outside the Panama Canal, about 300
striking dockworkers moved car-sized containers across the port
entrance to battle an army takeover ordered Thursday by the
government. The men are demanding to get paid.
   No vehicles or machinery were passing in or out.
   Ports at Panama City and Colon closed Monday when dockworkers
struck. The Panama Canal Commission said the shutdowns had no
effect on its operations.
   The military was also ordered to take over electrical, water and
telephone companies, airports, and several government ministries,
all struck by workers demanding salaries.
   In firing the five officers Friday, Noriega gave no reason.
   Col. Bernardo Barrera had been in charge of intelligence for the
15,000-member Defense Forces, which includes Panama's military and
police.
   A source close to the Defense Forces said Barrera might have
been faulted for not knowing in advance of Wednesday's coup attempt.
   The four American military police arrested Thursday night in
Panama City were identified by Critica as Danny H. Feltro, William
Jerry, Virts Richard and Tammy Markley.
   Francisco Artola, vice president of the opposition National
Authentic Party, said his radio station in Changuinola, Bocas del
Toro province, was raided and closed Friday by Defense Force guards.

   Japanese officials were sitting in their
embassy studying a major Senate trade document while House members
were forced to wait hours to get their copies, an influential
lawmaker complained Thursday.
   An irate Rep. William Frenzel, R-Minn., told a closed-door
caucus of House trade lawmakers he finally obtained a copy of the
paper by messenger from the Japanese as a courtesy three hours
before it arrived from the Senate.
   Frenzel's remarks to House members of a House-Senate conference
committee drafting a sweeping trade bill were confirmed by his
administrative assistant, Pat Eveland, who also handles trade
legislation for him.
   ``We think it would be nice if the Senate would decide to give
us the trade offer first before the private sector and the press,''
she said when asked what Frenzel told the caucus. His aides said
the congressman himself was not available to discuss the matter.
   The document was a compromise offer from Senate members of the
conference committee. It was designed to resolve conflicts between
House and Senate versions of the 1,000-page trade bill, primarily
sections dealing with unfair practices by the Japanese and other
trading partners.
   Among other things, it contained the Senate's proposal to erase
the from the bill the controversial trade plan sponsored by
Democratic presidential hopeful Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo. His
proposal, calling for 10 percent yearly rollbacks in Japanese trade
surpluses, is contained only in the House bill.
   In place of Gephardt's plan, the Senate is proposing its own,
so-called Super 301 proposal, which would require the U.S. trade
representative to draw up a list of Japanese barriers to American
products and then either negotiate an end to them or retaliate.
   Eveland said that she was on the telephone with a Japanese
Embassy official early Wednesday morning, discussing the Senate's
offer, when to her surprise ``it became evident that they had a
copy of it.''
   She said that she asked the Japanese for a copy and that they
immediately duplicated theirs and sent it by messenger to Frenzel's
office on Capitol Hill. She said a version was not available from
the Senate Finance Committee until 12:30 p.m. Wednesday.
   Just how the Japanese managed to obtain the offer remained
unclear, Eveland said. Several copies were distributed to reporters
who worked late in the Senate Press Gallery on Tuesday night.
   Meanwhile, Rep. Tom Downey, D-N.Y., said he also was among those
who were forced to wait and finally had to go out of channels to
get his copy.

   A spokeswoman for Nicaragua's Contra rebels said
Thursday that peace talks scheduled to begin Monday with the
Sandinista government are still on despite a reported clash at the
Nicaraguan-Honduran border.
   The government of Daniel Ortega and Contra representatives are
scheduled to begin three days of talks in the southern Nicaraguan
town of Sapoa near the border with Costa Rica.
   Intense fighting continued Thursday between the rebels and 2,000
Sandinista soldiers in Honduras, said Marta Sacasa, spokeswoman for
the Nicaraguan Resistance, a Contra umbrella group.
   Unless there is an official decision otherwise, the peace talks
will go on despite the Contras' weakened military position, she
said. Some resistance leaders already have left the U.S. for the
scheduled talks.
   ``The intention of the Sandinistas was to weaken our position at
the negotiating table,'' Ms. Sacasa said. ``It's also timed to
coincide with the end of United States aid.''
   Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government said its troops were
not in Honduras.
   But the Reagan administration said Sandinista forces were in
Honduras and were threatening to overrun Contra bases, and it
dispatched 3,200 U.S. combat troops.
   ``The United States troops did not go to Honduras to involve
themselves with the fighting in any way, so we have no comment,''
Ms. Sacasa said.
   Preliminary reports indicated 10 Contra rebels were killed and
56 wounded in the Sandinista offensive, she said. ``They knew we
would not be resupplied, ... but our determination and morale are
unwavering and high,'' Ms. Sacasa said.

<TEXT>
   A Soviet actor has asked for political asylum in
France and will be allowed to stay in the country while his request
is considered, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said Thursday.
   In Madrid, the independent daily El Pais cited police sources as
saying Alexi Maslov, a member of the Taganka theater company, flew
to Paris Wednesday shortly after being granted asylum in France.
   But the French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the actor ``is expected within the
next few days.'' She said his asylum request was under review.
   She said Maslov would be treated as a political refugee and
would be granted a temporary resident alien permit while his case
is reviewed by French courts.
   El Pais said Maslov had been in the care of Madrid police since
shortly after he arrived in Madrid on March 14 with the rest of the
Taganka troupe to take part in the International Theater Festival
of Madrid.
   He had been scheduled to perform Thursday in the play ``The
Mother'' by Maxim Gorki.
   Taganka director Nikolai L. Dupak and a Soviet Embassy official
had reported Maslov missing Tuesday after he failed to return to
the hotel where the troupe was staying, the newspaper said.
   The Soviet Embassy had no comment on the report.

   Despite a scriptwriters' strike, producers of
the new ``The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour'' decided Thursday to
make six of the TV shows even though they have only three
union-written scripts.
   CBS announced the hour-long show starring Tom and Dick Smothers
would debut March 30 at 8 p.m. Production plans had been postponed
by the strike by 9,000 TV and film scriptwriters belonging to the
Writers Guild of America.
   The writers went on strike March 7 against the Alliance of
Motion Picture and Television Producers over creative control and
residuals from syndication and distribution abroad.
   No new talks are scheduled. A session was held with a federal
mediator over the weekend.
   Producers say their final offer is a $50 million increase; the
union says the package would represent a $37 million loss to its
members.
   A CBS spokesman who talked on condition he not be identified
said six ``Smothers Brothers'' shows were planned, and three
scripts were in hand.
   He would not say what would happen if the strike were still in
progress when it came time for the fourth show.
   Script contain not only dialogue and monologue but lighting and
stage directions. Under the guild contract, not even cue cards can
be drawn up without violating the strike.
   The ``Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour'' is a follow-up to a
well-received reunion of the old Smothers Brothers cast earlier
this season.
   The Smothers Brothers first comedy-variety show for CBS was
canceled in 1969 after running into a long stream of censorship
problems.
   Union spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden said the guild had no immediate
comment on the decision to go ahead with the program.
   One of the show's producers, Ken Kragen, did not immediately
return a message seeking comment.
   WGA members resumed picketing Thursday, with about 800
sign-carrying members showing up at the CBS-MTM complex in the
Studio City section of Los Angeles.

<HEAD>Canada Wants to Deport Dutch Immigrant Accused as Nazi
Collaborator</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canada has begun efforts to deport a Dutch
immigrant convicted in his native land of collaborating with the
Nazis during the German occupation of World War II.
   The office of Secretary of State David Crombie said Thursday it
has moved to strip Jacob Luitjens, a retired botany teacher at the
University of British Columbia, of his Canadian citizenship.
   Luitjens, in his late 60s, is fighting the attempt in the
federal court. He declined comment to reporters from his home in
Vancouver, but five years ago Luitjens denied allegations he helped
round up people resisting Nazi rule.
   Crombie's spokesman, Jocelyn Francoeur, said full details cannot
be disclosed because the case is pending in court.
   But Nazi-hunter Sol Littman, Canadian representative of the
Simon Wiesenthal Center, hailed the government's action as a
breakthrough in catching up with war-crime suspects who entered
Canada decades ago.
   ``We've been after this guy for years and years,'' he said. ``We
know the Dutch government wanted him very badly.''
   Based on information from witnesses and other sources, Littman
alleged that Luitjens and his family belonged to the Dutch National
Socialist Party before the war and that Luitjens and his father
volunteered for the auxiliary police during the Nazi occupation.
   Littman said Luitjens was directly involved in the deaths of a
19-year-old member of the Dutch underground and a German deserter.
   He said that after the war Luitjens fled to Paraguay and lived
in a Mennonite colony, but was tried in his absence by a Dutch war
crimes court in 1948 and convicted of treason.
   Treason is not an extraditable offense in Canada. The government
rejected previous Dutch requests for Luitjens, who emigrated here
in 1961 and retired from teaching four years ago.
   The Toronto Star quoted Justice Minister Ray Hnatyshyn as saying
that because of the law, deportation, rather than a trial in
Canada, ``may be the only option available to us.''
   The government set up a war crimes unit in the Justice
Department last year, based on the report of a special commission
headed by Judge Jules Deschenes.
   Unlike the U.S. Office of Special Investigations, Canada chose
to concentrate on trying suspects here, rather than deporting or
extraditing them as Deschenes also recommended.
   The Deschenes report cited 20 cases requiring urgent action and
an additional 218 in need of further investigation.
   Under Canadian law, citizenship can be revoked if it was
obtained fraudulently or by withholding facts that would have
disqualified the applicant _ such as criminal convictions.
   Even if Luitjens loses the citizenship battle, he can appeal
deportation through the courts. The law normally requires
deportation to the country from which a person arrived, in this
case Paraguay rather than the Netherlands.

   Amoco Corp. will install steel ``suspenders'' on
its landmark lakeside skyscraper to ensure that the white marble
facade stays put on blustery days in the Windy City, an executive
said Thursday.
   Marble slabs sheathing the world's fourth-tallest building are
starting to curl or bow after 15 years, said Shelby Pierce, Amoco's
engineering manager. The 275-pound slabs are 1\-inch thick, and
measure 4-feet-2 by 3-feet-9.
   If the straps don't work, Amoco may have to strip the stark,
1,136-foot building near Lake Michigan of its gleaming facade, he
said.
   Next week, workers will begin installing bolted-in stainless
steel straps, 2 inches wide, at one corner of the building at a
minimum cost of $1 million.
   ``We're looking at an area where the most severe bows occur. The
southeast corner gets most exposure to sun and thermal cycles and
heavy wind,'' Pierce said. ``It's almost like a belt and
suspenders.''
   ``Hopefully it wouldn't look like a checkerboard,'' he said.
   Pierce said the company noticed the problem in 1979. By
November, the condition of the marble began to get worse.
   ``There are two philosophies,'' Pierce said. ``One philosophy is
that as marble bows, it's an indication of loss of strength.
Another philosophy is that's not true.''
   ``Our particular difficulty is that we have four different
grades of marble on the building,'' he said.
   While workers spend six weeks reinforcing the southeast corner,
engineers will check the rest of the building to see if more
drastic measures are needed, he said.

<HEAD>Urban Guerrillas Say Polling Places Are `Military Objectives'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leftist urban guerrilla group
says polling places in Sunday's elections are ``military
objectives'' and is warning people to stay away from them.
   The armed forces said guerrillas killed the mayor of a northern
town on Thursday, and the governing Christian Democratic Party
reported a mayoral candidate was kidnapped.
   The warning was issued Wednesday night by the Pedro Pablo
Castillo Urban Command, a unit of the People's Revolutionary Army,
one of five groups battling the U.S.-backed government.
   The five groups, united in the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front, have rejected the legislative and municipal
elections. The rebels insist that peace must be achieved before any
election is held.
   They declared a nationwide ban on transportation as of today in
an effort to disrupt the voting.
   The statement was given to a local television crew that was
taken blindfolded to a guerrilla safe-house. Channel 6 broadcast
part of an interview and provided The Associated Press with a
transcript of the rest Thursday.
   The broadcast did not show the guerrillas.
   The Defense Ministry said this week that about 53,000 of its
56,000 troops will be deployed to provide election security.
Defense Minister Gen. Eugenio Vides Casanova said his men could
guarantee secure voting in 244 of the nation's 262 municipalities.
   The guerrilla document advises people ``to avoid gathering at
polling places, because, due to the presence of troops, they ...
will be considered military objectives by our units.''
   It also called on filling stations to stop selling gasoline and
warned that the ones remaining open ``will be declared military
objectives.''
   The leader of the urban cell, known as Commander Ester, told the
TV crew: ``The urban commando cells are going to take a series of
actions to repudiate the elections and to repudiate U.S.
intervention in our country.''
   The guerrillas recently began urban units, and it was not clear
if the statement covered the one group or the entire guerrilla
front.
   The United States provided almost $600 million in aid to El
Salvador last year, more than the amount given any other country in
the Western Hemisphere.
   At least 65,000 people have died since the guerrillas took up
arms in 1979.
   The armed forces press office said guerrillas killed Mayor
Sergio Romero of Azacualpa on Thursday. It said in a communique
that the rebels then went to San Miguel de Mercedes, also in
northern Chalatenango province, and burned the mayor's office and
the post office.
   The Christian Democrats said mayoral candidate Faustino Flores
of Coatepeque in Santa Ana province was kidnapped Wednesday night.
The party said guerrilla leaflets were found at Flores' house.
   The guerrilla front says the elections are not legitimate
because they cannot be free and fair in wartime.
   The rebels demand a share of power in return for laying down
their arms. The government rejects this.

   The Security Council will meet in urgent
session Friday on the Nicaraguan-Honduran border crisis and on the
dispatch of U.S. troops to Honduras.
   Nicaragua sought the meeting at President Daniel Ortega's
request, diplomats said. Envoys of the United States, Nicaragua and
Honduras were to speak. There were no immediate plans for a
resolution or a vote in the 15-member council, the highest U.N.
body.
   Washington has said the 3,000 U.S. troops it was sending to
Honduras were to engage in joint military exercises with the
Hondurans.
   Honduras complained that Sandinista troops from neighboring
Nicaragua entered Honduras in pursuit of Contra rebels. President
Reagan has called it an invasion by Nicaraguan forces.
   Nicaragua and Panama used a council debate on British military
maneuvers in the Falkland Islands Thursday to condemn U.S. military
activities in Central America.
   ``Nicaragua, having suffered pillage and spoilage by English
buccaneers who pillaged our coast, is victim today of the threats
and aggression of another American state,'' Nicaragua's acting
ambassador, Julio Icaza Gallardo, told the council.
   ``Nicaragua denounces once again this gunboat policy which
reflects disdain for our dignity and rights.''
   Britain and Argentina fought a 74-day war over the Falklands in
1982, lost by Argentina.
   Panama's ambassador, George Eduardo Ritter, drew a parallel
between the British claim on the Falklands and U.S. control over
the Panama Canal Zone.

<TEXT>
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir warned
American Jews on Thursday not to compare Palestinian protests in
the occupied territories to a civil rights struggle.
   ``These are another expression of the Arab refusal to accept
Israel, to coexist with us, and to recognize that Israel is a
permanent feature in the region,'' Shamir said.
   The protesters ``cry, `Palestine is Arab,' and openly declare
that all of Palestine is theirs,'' Shamir told about 1,500 members
of the Jewish community at a dedication of a cornerstone for a
museum commemorating the Holocaust.
   ``These are not passive civil rights marches,'' he said.
   Shamir, fresh from his meeting with President Reagan, Secretary
of State George P. Shultz and congressional leaders, reiterated his
opposition to an American plan for peace in the Middle East that
calls for an international conference.
   Shamir, his address punctuated by enthusiastic applause, said
the proposal would play into the hands of the Soviets and Arabs,
who he said are trying to bypass direct talks with Israel.
   ``We are for direct negotiations, without preconditions, for
open talks at which each side will present its views and claims on
an equal footing, without outside intervention,'' Shamir said.
   He called on his audience to close ranks behind Israel as it
tries to quell rioting by Palestinians on the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip, which Israel has occupied since the 1967 Mideast war.
   ``When unity breaks down, then our enemies exploit every
critical statement to their own end,'' he said, referring
apparently to criticism by some American Jews of the Israeli Army's
use of beatings and live ammunition to quell the riots.
   At least 100 Palestinians have been killed in more than three
months of violence, and hundreds wounded.
   Shamir flew Thursday from Washington to Los Angeles, where he
helped dedicate the cornerstone of the Simon Wiesenthal Center's
Beit Hashoah-Museum of Tolerance. The museum focuses on the
extermination of Jews by Nazi Germany.

   Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. announced Thursday it

Bridgestone Corp.
   Firestone's board unanimously recommended shareholders accept an
offer of $80 a share from Tokyo-based Bridgestone for all
outstanding common shares.
   Firestone also said its board recommended that shareholders
reject a rival, unsolicited $58-a-share buyout offer from Italian
tiremaker Pirelli SpA.
   The Bridgestone offer is subject to at least two-thirds of the
shares being tendered and approval of the deal by Firestone
shareholders.
   The agreement was announced after the stock market closed.
Firestone stock dipped 62{ cents to $62.50 a share Thursday on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   Firestone ranks fourth in tire sales worldwide, behind Goodyear,
Michelin and Bridgestone, according to industry estimates.

   Defense Secrtary Frank C. Carlucci said
Thursday he protested to his Soviet counterpart Nicaragua's alleged
intrusion into Honduras.
   Carlucci said he and Dmitri Yazov briefly discussed the
Nicaragua-Honduras dispute and that Yazov ``made some attempt to
defend the Sandinista action.''
   ``I would not characterize it as a vigorous defense,'' he added
at a news conference in Bern. Carlucci arrived back in Washington
later Thursday.
   U.S. troops arrived in Honduras on Thursday after the United
States and Honduras accused Nicaraguan troops of entering the
country in pursuit of U.S.-backed Contra rebels. Carlucci said he
had endorsed the decision.
   Carlucci described the three days of closed-door talks with
Yazov as ``cordial and businesslike,'' and said Yazov invited him
to Moscow to continue their discussions at a later date.
   At a separate news conference, Yazov termed the discussions, the
first ever business session between U.S. and Soviet defense chiefs,
as ``quite candid and very useful.''
   Carlucci said that ``of course, there were a number of areas of
disagreement.'' Yazov said the Kremlin ``does not harbor any
illusions'' about a breakthrough in superpower relations.
   The two sides announced agreement that the chairman of the U.S.
joint chiefs of staff, Adm. William Crowe, and the Soviet Chief of
Staff, Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev, will meet soon to work out
guidelines to prevent friction between U.S. and Soviet forces.
   Carlucci said he had not obtained the apology he sought for the
fatal shooting by a Soviet soldier of U.S. Army Maj. Arthur
Nicholson in East Germany three years ago.
   Yazov said the incident occurred before he became defense
minister last May and was being handled by the foreign ministry,
according to Carlucci.
   The two sides also discussed the U.S. proposed space-based
defense plan and regional conflicts, including Angola, Cambodia and
Korea, Carlucci said.
   Yazov said in a statement that both sides agreed to hold further
talks on each other's military doctrine and to consider an exchange
of data.
   He called for launching all-European negotiations on
conventional arms this year.

   The first step in bailing out Texas' largest
bank holding company is raising concerns about the long-term health
of the fund that insures deposits in most of the nation's
commercial banks.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said Thursday it was loaning
$1 billion to banks owned by First RepublicBank Corp. of Dallas for
six months in a move to reassure depositors worried about the
banks' shaky real estate loans.
   The infusion represents only about 5 percent of the FDIC's
insurance fund, which backs deposits of $100,000 and less at 13,600
banks. But bank analysts believe it could turn out to be the first
big hit of a bad year for the fund.

   A bipartisan group of senators proposed a $48
million package of new aid to Nicaragua's Contra rebels Friday,
including renewed authority for the CIA to deliver previously
stockpiled weapons.
   As U.S. troops continued to arrive in Honduras in a show of
force, Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams said additional
assistance was being discussed with Honduran President Jose Azcona,
in response to a reported Nicaraguan incursion.
   White House chief of staff Howard Baker said President Reagan
would give ``most careful'' consideration to any request from
Honduras for troops to help repel Nicaraguan forces, although he
reiterated that U.S. troops were not expected to be involved in any
military operation in the region.

   The federal government on Friday tried to
bolster its amnesty program by giving illegal aliens who file in
the final month of the plan 60 more days to provide documents to
support their applications.
   Under the change in the program _ which has attracted a
lower-than-anticipated number of applications _ amnesty seekers
will be able to file a skeletal application from April 4 to the May
4 deadline without producing back-up documentation and medical data
until sometime after July 5.
   The Reagan administration has said it opposes extending the
filing deadline, despite sentiment in Congress to do so.

   A study using ultrasonic heart scans
called echocardiograms has found that people with an enlarged left
side of the heart are two to three times as likely as others to
have a heart attack or stroke, researchers said Friday.
   The defect, called left ventricular hypertrophy, has previously
been associated with congestive heart failure. But this is the
first time it has been identified as an independent risk factor for
strokes and heart attacks, said Dr. William Castelli, who presented
the findings at a meeting of the American Heart Association.
   ``The size of your left ventricle is going to be the price you
pay for high blood pressure and overweight,'' Castelli said. ``That
should be recognized now as a powerful risk factor. It's as
powerful as cholesterol, blood pressure and smoking, and indeed in
the short term it's even slightly more powerful than some of those
traditional risk factors.''

   Millions of Asians
prayed, pounded drums, and danced in the streets Friday to greet
total eclipse of the sun that drew a four-minute curtain of
darkness across land and sea.
   Young Filipinos shot rifles and tossed firecrackers at the
blackened sky. In northern India, thousands of naked men and women
jostled their way into huge, sacred pools to cleanse their souls in
a massive Hindu ritual.
   The eclipse was the most spectacular along a 108-mile swath that
moved from the Indian Ocean across Indonesia and the southern
Philippine island of Mindanao during the morning hours. But a
partial eclipse could be seen as far west as India and eastward
into parts of Australia, New Guinea and the Pacific islands.

   Israeli troops fired on Palestinians in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip on Friday following noon Moslem prayers,
killing two Arabs, the army said. At least 25 protesters were
wounded in the clashes.
   Two Israeli civilians were detained for allegedly stockpiling an
arsenal of weapons intended for anti-Arab attacks, police said.
   Israeli military authorities detained a prominent attorney from
Gaza and four Arab journalists, prompting an outcry from Israeli
liberals. Authorities also ordered foreign journalists out of the

   One of the fiercest recent spells in the
Iran-Iraq war was reported Friday: 37 missiles fired into cities,
four ships attacked, seven warplanes shot down and thousands of
soldiers killed or wounded.
   Iran said its forces had captured two towns in a 5-day-old drive
into northeastern Iraq, in which it claims 9,200 Iraqis have been
killed or wounded and 4,000 taken prisoner, and recaptured Nowsud,
an Iranian border town. Nowsud was overrun by Iraqi soldiers soon
after the war began in September 1980.
   Dispatches from the official Islamic Republic News Agency
claimed five Iraqi jets were destroyed in 24 hours, including three
French-built F-1 Mirage fighter-bombers out to raid Iranian tankers
Friday in the northern Persian Gulf. Iraq claimed two Iranian jets
downed.

   Leftist guerrillas on Friday
burned buses, taxis and other vehicles that defied their nationwide
ban on transport, and they threatened more sabotage to disrupt
weekend elections.
   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, an alliance of
five guerrilla groups, claimed its fighters attacked three soldiers
guarding a gas station outside this capital.
   The armed forces press office said it could not confirm or deny
the report, made on the guerrilla radio station. The radio said
three soldiers were killed or wounded, but it didn't give details.

<HEAD>Hungary Has East Bloc's First Association for Entrepreneurs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peter Simsa is the very model of a
modern East bloc businessman.
   He has his own company, a carpeted office where he serves guests
brandy in snifters and a telephone in his car.
   Now he has his own lobbying group, the first of its kind in the
East bloc, the National Association of Hungarian Entrepreneurs.
   The organization, of which Simsa is president, is dedicated to
promoting small businesses in Hungary and representing their
interests to the government.
   Under the leadership of Communist Party chief Janos Kadar,
Hungary in the early 1960s adopted economic policies that
encouraged some private ownership and enterprise.
   The so-called ``goulash communism'' gave Hungary one of the
highest standards of living in the Soviet-led East bloc, although
mounting foreign debt and big money-losing state enterprises
recently have bleakened economic prospects.
   Hungarians were allowed to take second or third jobs, such as
providing services or operating small private shops.
   In the late 1970s, the government began to allow private
partnerships and ``small cooperatives'' operating as small private
companies.
   What distinguishes them from state cooperatives is that they
spring from private initiative and are established with private
capital.
   Simsa's Vertikum enterprise was the first such small cooperative
to come into being in 1979. Today, he said, Hungary has 40,000
private businesses, which account for more than 15 percent of the
gross national product.
   Some 60,000 of the 10.6 million Hungarians are engaged in
private business as their main job, and 540,000 others work part
time in the private sector.
   Originally, a department specializing in private entrepreneurs
was set up in the Hungarian Chamber of Commerce, a governmental
agency.
   But increasing private enterprise and a desire for greater
independence led Simsa to seek permission for a separate
association.
   ``Our two basic criteria were that ... it should be a nationwide
union and ... that it should fulfil the aim of representing our
interests,'' he said.
   The government agreed last year to recognize the association,
with the proviso that it be supervised by the Chamber of Commerce.
   Simsa stressed that the relationship with the chamber ``does not
mean a subordination.''
   On Feb. 20, the association held its first general congress and
in less than a week signed up 1,500 members, half its pre-congress
goal of 3,000 members this year.
   ``It was really difficult to foresee how many people had any
sense of community or entrepreneurial identity,'' Simsa said.
   The association has attracted interest from other East bloc
countries. Izvestia, the Soviet government newspaper, and Radio
Prague in Czechoslavkia asked for interviews. Simsa also had talks
with the U.S. Chambers of Commerce.
   ``The chief problem is the economic regulation,'' said Simsa.
``Regulators do not take into consideration the specific
characteristics of our group. While officially they say that they
would like to inspire people, to give incentives (but) in reality
they are very rigid.''
   An example, he said, is the rule that one person can make and
sell bread, but a group of people cannot do the same thing.
   ``There are plans to change this,'' he added. In addition to
fighting regulations, the association will strive to make private
business accepted as partners with the government, he said.
   Now, he complained, private enterprises often are at the bottom
of the list when it comes to allocating scarce resources.
   Private companies are permitted only 30 employees, and the
average size is eight people, Simsa said.
   For a small cooperative, the law mandates 15 to 100 cooperative
members, who in turn can hire as many workers as they want. A
typical work force is 100 to 200.
   Simsa said when it allowed more business, the original aim of
the government was to improve the availability of small service,
such as small shoemakers and shopkeepers.
   ``However, in reality these private entrepreneurs don't go into
this direction where the government wants them to but where there
is money,'' he said. ``The best market for them is the state
companies and cooperatives.''
   So entrepreneurs perform specialized services for the big state
factories or provide raw or intermediate materials.
   Simsa's Vertikum, for instance, maintains cooling systems and
strengthens concrete cooling towers and grain elevators. He started
the business with nine workers and $21. Today there are 115 co-op
members and employees, and the business has $543,000 in property.
   Other entrepreneurs have opened marriage mediation bureaus or
factories to make medical protheses.
   Last year, Hungary's biggest small cooperative had revenues of
$32 million. In 1988, it might exceed $43 million.

<HEAD>A 10 Percent Savings Rate?</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Back in 1985, when stocks were still hot stuff
and destined to become hotter, such things as brokerage fees,
foreign cars, audio-visual equipment and recreation were among the
fast-growing consumer expenditures.
   It was a year of big hopes, and the stock market was viewed as
the way to fulfill those hopes. Brokerage fees in that year rose 54
percent, for example, making that category the biggest year-to-year
gainer.
   The economy was full of big notions, many of them generated by
the big-spending group of ``baby boomers'' _ those born by the
bundles in the 1950s and now in their 30s and sometimes called
yuppies. They were a driving force.
   The spending continued in 1986, when the biggest year-to-year
percentage gainer among consumer expenditures was the 97 percent
for boats, followed at 50.7 percent by recreational vehicles.
   Those were also years of very low savings rate and strong credit
use. In fact, one might safely say that people were too busy
spending to bother very much about savings.
   But something happened early in 1987, and in retrospect it might
have given a hint of the crash to come in October. Judging from
expenditures, hopes weren't as high. Mundane, practical items moved
to the fore.
   At 11.5 percent, the big gainer was books and maps, followed by
funeral and burial expenses, floor coverings, hand tools and
automotive repairs.
   To Edward Yardeni, economics director at Prudential-Bache
Securities, the figures reveal more _ the ``aging'' of the baby
boomers as they move as a demographic wave through the economy.
   Based on their advancing years, he makes a startling forecast:
``We predict that over the next five years the personal savings
rate will rise to 10 percent.''
   A double-digit savings rate? It has never happened in the United
States for any prolonged period of time, barring the World War II
years when there wasn't very much to buy, and lots of money to put
away for the bright days to follow.
   Yardeni has a point, though. Those low savings and high spending
rates of the mid-1980s reflected the economic activities of an age
category that traditionally is inclined to big expenditures.
   Now, he observes, the yuppies are turning into couch potatoes.
They _ at least some of them _ have made their trips and spent
their money and obtained their material possessions, and now they
want to rest.
   Instead of running around and looking for things to buy, they
are relaxing. They don't go out to eat as often as before, but are
home enjoying the products of their own ovens. In a material sense,
they've ``got theirs.''
   As a direct consequence, Yardeni believes, the days of low
savings rates is over, at least for a while. Last year the savings
rate of 3.8 percent was the lowest since 1947, compared with an 8
percent rate in the 1970s.
   The economic implications are fascinating, including among other
things the probability that a lot of folks will start paying off
their big bills and that plenty of money will be available for
business investment.
   But if people become such economic dullards as a 10 percent
savings rate would suggest, won't the economy almost cease growing?
   Not so, says economist Yardeni.
   He points out that ``a rising savings rate doesn't imply a
reduction in consumption, just a slower growth rate.'' As he sees
it, the economy will continue to expand, and the implication is
that the growth will be healthier.

<HEAD>Polly Bergen Leads Revenge Plotters in `Addicted to His Love'</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polly Bergen says her two most recent roles,
as Rhoda in ``War and Remembrance'' and as Vivian in the ABC movie
``Addicted to His Love,'' represent the extremes of her personality.
   She reprises her role as Rhoda in ABC's 30-hour miniseries ``War
and Remembrance,'' the sequel to ``The Winds of War.'' It will be
broadcast next season on ABC.
   ``Addicted to His Love,'' a movie in which a group of women
swindled by a romantic con artist seek revenge, will appear on ABC
next Monday.
   ``I loved playing Rhoda,'' Bergen said. ``I loved her in all her
weaknesses and shallowness. I understood her and cared about her.
   ``That's why I like Vivian so much. She's so strong. She sets up
the scam to take care of the jerk who ripped them off. The funny
thing is that Vivian and Rhoda are the two extremes of me. People
see me as having all the strength of Vivian, but I'm really as
frightened as Rhoda. But I guess I'm closer to Vivian.''
   When Bergen signed for the movie it was called ``Sisterhood.''
At one time it was called ``Sweet Vengeance.'' She had a few
choice, but unprintable, words about the new title.
   ``It was a good part but only a moderate script when I signed,''
she said. ``The day I arrived to begin work the script had been
drastically improved. As we went along there was more rewriting and
it got better and better. That's why I think we got such good
people.''
   The movie also stars Barry Bostwick as the con artist, Erin
Gray, Linda Purl and Dee Wallace Stone as his other victims and
Colleen Camp as a woman who helps them in their plot. Arthur Allan
Seidelman directed from a screenplay by Ronni Simon and Richard
Alfieri.
   ``It's not a comedy, but there's a lot of comedy in it,'' said
Bergen. ``My biggest scene is very moving, heartbreaking, but the
rest of my appearances are fun. It becomes a game to get him.
   ``I'm the oldest and wealthiest of the women. I play a widow
who's lonely and vulnerable, and she fell for this very slick man.
When it's over it very nearly destroys my belief in myself as a
woman. So I have an enormous anger and have to make a decision. I
have to expose myself and my pride to get this done.''
   In ``War and Remembrance,'' she returned to her role as the wife
of Pug Henry (Robert Mitchum), the naval officer who observes much
of the war effort in the books by Herman Wouk. Rhoda has an affair
with the scientist played by Peter Graves.
   ``I had total sympathy for her,'' Bergen said. ``She had built
her life around her husband. All she ever wanted was a little
appreciation and affection. When she no longer got it from him, she
turned elsewhere. She was shallow, but she had always been there
for her husband and family.''
   After four years with the role, playing it, rehearsing it,
learning lines, and preparing for it, she was very sad to finally
take her leave of Rhoda.
   ``The last day was very traumatic,'' she said. ``It was like
walking away from a part of myself. I had grown very close to her.''
   Bergen said she is currently considering two theatrical movie
scripts and two scripts for TV comedies.
   ``The trouble is 90 percent of the scripts for the new season
have characters whose oldest age is 22,'' said. ``I'm not 22. I've
run companies for more than 20 years. I'm a bright woman. I look at
TV's highest-rated shows. They're not about kids. I know the
demographics of the country. I don't understand why all the scripts
are for kids. It's beyond my comprehension.''
   Bergen, who is married to business entrepreneur Jeffrey
Endervelt, has three grown children and lives in New York. Besides
her film and TV work, she also runs companies that manufacture
shoes, handbags and belts.

   An alleged racial attack on a black teen-ager in
New York's Hudson Valley has made headlines for months. Now,
authorities in a rural New Jersey town are working to solve a crime
with some chilling similarities.

<TEXT>
   Hildegard Smith doesn't remember the 30-odd
years she spent raising her family in this rural county seat.
Friends say the 50-year-old mother of five knows that the people
gathered at her bedside are her children, but only because they've
told her so.
   She believes Richard Smith when he tells her he is her husband,
but cannot conjure memories of their years together or the plans
they made to retire soon to Florida.
   Yet when she shuts her eyes, those close to her say, Mrs. Smith
sees as vividly as if it were just happening the faces of two white
men who accosted her in her apartment building stairwell, chopped
off her hair, smeared her with excrement, painted markings on her
face and told her, ``We don't want niggers in this town.''
   Suffering from amnesia since the morning attack Feb. 8, Mrs.
Smith is in seclusion, being guarded by her family and supported by
a growing coalition of clergy members, citizens and community
leaders.
   Meanwhile, the town's tiny detective squad is working overtime
trying to find the assailants.
   The Rev. William J. Sadler, interim pastor of the First
Presbyterian Church and a leader of the coalition, likened the
community's response to the attack to the way a person reacts to
the death of a loved one.
   ``They go through all the same phases,'' he said. ``First, they
say `Did this really happen?' ... Then, they get angry.''
   And underlying the anger here are feelings of impotence and
anxiety.
   ``We don't know who they are,'' Sadler said of the assailants.
   So, the question remains: Was it an evil passing through this
town or has something dark within been revealed?
   ``People have been calling, asking, `Are we racist?''' Newton
Administrator Camille Furgiuele said.
   Newton, nestled among hills 60 miles northwest of New York City,
is home to 8,000 people, of whom an estimated 150 are black.
   ``We're really a lily white community,'' Sadler said.
   But not a racist community, said Sadler, Mrs. Furgiuele and
others.
   ``There is prejudice no matter where you go,'' Mrs. Furgiuele
said. ``I can't say that there is no prejudice here. But I don't
think it exists in Newton anymore than anywhere else.''
   Sylvester Fletcher, a 54-year-old black scientist who urged the
formation of the coalition, put it this way:
   ``There are undercurrents of racism in every community. In that
regard, Newton is not an exceptionally good place. It's a decent
place.
   ``People here either like you or they let you alone,'' he added.
   John Gibson, 37-year-old co-owner of the County Seat restaurant,
doubted the attackers were locals.
   ``I don't think they could be from around here. I've noticed
that people here only usually do harm to themselves ... drinking
too much, that sort of thing,'' he said.
   Newton is facing transition. A nearby interstate highway
completed just over a decade ago has brought traffic to town and
made urban New Jersey seem closer.
   The attack on Mrs. Smith has made the cities seem closer still.
   ``People tell me they're locking their doors,'' Mrs. Furgiuele
said.
   However, more apparent than any sense of fear, is the feeling of
a community protecting its own.
   Although dozens knew of the attack shortly after a neighbor
found Mrs. Smith, the story was kept under wraps. Mrs. Smith,
hospitalized for 12 days immediately after the attack, initially
was unable to talk about the incident.
   By the time police had the full story, days had turned into
weeks and community leaders were getting anxious, Fletcher said.
   ``I am a positive person,'' he said. ``I wanted something
positive to happen.''
   ``We had to make a statement that this community would not
accept this kind of violence,'' Sadler added.
   Richard Smith finally agreed to let the new coalition publicize
his wife's case. A Feb. 26 news conference was called at which Mrs.
Smith's identity was revealed and composite sketches of the
assailants were handed out.
   The sketches appear on 10,000 wanted posters that were
distributed last week. A reward of $13,000 was offered for
information leading to arrests.
   The ensuing publicity has been rough on Police Chief Larry
Romyns. He has one full-time detective and one part time. And
shortly after the attack on Mrs. Smith, there was a murder. A man
is accused of slaying his wife because she intended to divorce him.
   Romyns said his detectives have received dozens of leads.
   Others are leery of what the publicity might bring to the
community.
   ``We do not want anyone to escalate this into a Wappingers Falls
situation,'' Sadler said, referring to the New York state hometown
of a 16-year-old black girl who says she was sexually assaulted by
six white men.
   When the teen-ager, Tawana Brawley, was found last November,
excrement was smeared on her and ``KKK'' and ``nigger'' were
written on her body. Some of her hair had been chopped off.
   Officials here say they do not know if the attack on Mrs. Smith
was a ``copycat'' reaction to the Brawley case. But they are quick
to point out the differences between them.
   Mrs. Smith was not sexually assaulted; Miss Brawley was, she
told police. Also, people here say this is local affair that will
be handled without the help of outsiders.
   ``If (the Rev.) Al Sharpton showed up, we wouldn't want him
here,'' Sadler said, referring to the civil rights activist who has
taken up Miss Brawley's case. Sharpton and others have encouraged
Miss Brawley not to cooperate with authorities, claiming that for
various reasons they cannot be trusted to handle the case properly.
   The community is not without outside support. The state chapter
of the National Assocation for the Advancement of Colored People
has intitiated an investigation of the incident. The state Assembly
has passed a resolution expressing a ``vehement cry of outrage.''
And the Newark-North Jersey Committee of Black Churchmen says it
will ask Gov. Thomas H. Kean to ``intercede in whatever way he
would deem necessary to bring this case to justice,'' according to
the group's leader, Dr. Edward Verner.
   One way the state can help, Sadler said, is by allocating money
from a fund for victims of violent crimes. The Smiths have no
health insurance and in addition to paying for Mrs. Smith's
hospital stay, the family faces huge bills for psychiatric
treatment she'll need.
   ``Our hope is that through treatment and time her memory will
come back,'' Sadler said.

   Although there are few signs of a looming
recession, the probability of one remains a subject of intense
discussion in certain areas of the country, such as New York.
   Why is this so? asks Albert Sindlinger, who was testing public
opinion as long ago as the Great Depression _ and as recently as
this very day _ and who declares again that recession isn't an
immediate threat.
   Sindlinger, whose company conducts scores of telephone
interviews each day, says he finds a contradiction between what he
reads and hears in the media and what ordinary folks around the
country are telling him and his staff.
   The people he and his staff talk to, he states, are confident
about their own economic future. He says their household money
supply, a measure of existing conditions, is healthy. And so are
their expectations, he says.
   He points out that these opinions can't be taken lightly because
the consumer factor _ the ability and willingness to buy _ is the
vital ingredient of our total economy, bigger even that business
and government.
   But, he continues, many of the economic reports he reads include
phrases such as ``when the recession begins'' rather than ``if
there is a recession.''
   He was especially indignant about the profiferation of these
references following the Oct. 19 stock market crash which, he
contends, bore no resemblance to 1929, which he vividly recalls.
So, he sought the reason why.
   Sindlinger now says the fault lies with the financial press,
which he says is headquartered in New York City, close to the
financial community.
   New York, he says, is a special situation that doesn't reflect
the country's mood.
   Ever since Black Monday, he says, ``we have been watching a
strong, steady decline in consumer confidence in one _ and only one
_ area: eastern New York state.''
   He declares that the economy in much of the country has improved
in the past year, and is continuing to do so. He couldn't have said
that in late 1986, when his readings showed 31 states in recession.
Now, he says, there are but four in recession: Oklahoma, Louisiana,
West Virginia and Mississippi.
   In short, by his estimates the nation's economy has been growing
stronger, but the economy of eastern New York has not. He measures
that area at barely above recession level.
   ``The weakness there is rooted around the New York City
financial community,'' he states. ``Large numbers have been laid
off, and many others say they are extremely concerned about their
lack of job security.
   ``These layoffs have spilled into the BMW automobile
dealerships, fur salons and fern restaurants. McDonald's also is
feeling the pinch on Manhattan Island, since lower-paid clerks are
being laid off, too.''
   He concludes:
   ``So, the financial press, stuck on the same island with the
financial houses and their current and former employees can't help
but get the idea that something's wrong with the economy.
   ``They see these people on the streets, and interview them for
their stories. Being observant people, they immediately sense that
people in the Big Apple are in trouble.''
   He asks: ``Do these causal observations affect their
interviewing and reporting?'' Seldom without an answer or an
explanation, the crusty Sindlinger responds:
   ``Are they human? Of course they're affected.''
   While conditions could improve around the country, he says, they
are a lot better than some New Yorkers believe they are.

<HEAD>Southern Town is What Lebanon Used to be</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RMEILEH, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the chaos and intolerance that is
Lebanon, Rmeileh is an oasis of liberty, a haven for people fleeing
political and social persecution and assassination.
   This coastal town, 19 miles south of Beirut, is what Lebanon
used to be before 13 years of civil war, sectarian hatreds and
religious fanatacism turned it into a wilderness.
   Leftists and other refugees from Beirut and the south have fled
to Rmeileh following a campaign of assassinations by Shiite Moslem
fundamentalists against communists, pro-Iraqi Baath socialists and
other leftists.
   One of the things that makes Rmeileh different from just about
everywhere else in south Lebanon is that alcohol is sold openly at
the side of the road.
   Alcohol is banned in most areas of the region, dominated by
Shiite Moslem factions, and in Beirut's southern slums, the Shiite
stronghold in the capital.
   Islamic religious laws also ban mixed parties, mixed bathing and
the consumption of pork.
   But in the summer, Rmeileh's eight restaurants and three miles
of Mediterranean beaches and hillside picnic areas are packed with
males and females having a good time. Pork also is sold.
   Hamza, 35, comes from the staunchly Shiite town of Nabatiyeh in
the south.
   ``We can't buy drinks in Nabatiyeh any more, so we come to
Rmeileh,'' he said. ``In summer women have to come here to swim
because it's the one of the very few places they can do that.''
   Because he lives in a Shiite area, where such activities are
forbidden, Hamza declined to disclose his full name.
   Rmeileh was a mainly Christian town, with about 5,000 Maronite
Catholics, until 1985, when Moslem forces overran the coastal
plain. Now only about 60 Maronite families are left.
   But Rmeileh now is protected by Communist Party militiamen, most
of them Christians, who are allied to neighboring Druse and Sunni
Moslem forces who help keep the Shiites out.
   The Syrian army also has a checkpoint just south of Rmeileh on
the Awali River which also acts as a deterrent for Shiite gunmen.
   Abu Rim, a leftist official in the town, said 500 refugee
families _ Moslems, Christians and Palestinians _ live in Rmeileh
with the local Christians.
   ``Our aim is to get rid of the sectarian atmosphere and
implement co-existence,'' he said.
   Elias Tabet, director of the town's government school, said
ethnic mix gives Rmeileh a non-sectarian nature, where people from
different areas and religions ``feel safe and free.''
   Samih Germanos, 57, a Christian who fled Beirut's
Shiite-controlled southern slums, said: ``We're very happy and hope
things will stay this way.''
   Acting Mayor Halim Kleib, said the tourist influx last summer
was even better than pre-war times.
   ``People in the south prefer Rmeileh to other places because
it's the closest resort to them that provides restaurants and
private beaches as well as drinks,'' Kleib added.
   Ali Hujeiri, 40, a father of nine, who works at a Pepsi Cola
plant in a nearby town, said he sells alcohol on the street to earn
extra money and that most of his customers are from the Shiite
south.
   ``I'm the only one to sell pork in this area,'' said Abu Elie, a
32-year-old shopowner.``I started bringing it from Mount Lebanon
last week and in four days, I sold around 40 kilograms (88
pounds).''
   Justice Minister Nabih Berri's Amal movement and the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah (Party of God) have been blamed for many
of the assasinations of leftists in south Lebanon.
   But since many of those who have fled to Rmeileh _
``self-deportees,'' Amal calls them _ are skilled or professional
people, the Amal recently asked them to return to their villages.
   Wafiq Rihan, a 33-year-old Shiite school teacher, didn't sound
as though he is ready to return. He said that after he fled
Nabatiyeh last year the Communists and the leftist Druse ``helped
us find places to stay and in the beginning we relied on Red Cross
supplies.''
   ``I'm teaching at the school now,'' he added. ``I was originally
a teacher. But most of the other deportees here are also working in
their particular fields, medicine, the law, and so on.
   ``One doctor who fled Nabatiyeh even has some of his old
patients come here to see him for treatment.''
   Rihan said he wants to go back to his own village but only when
it's safe.

<TEXT>
   Blunt criticisms of art censors have come to
be expected from China's most famous movie director, Wu Tianming,
even more than the evocative and provocative films produced by his
studio.
   It takes no prompting to set him off.
   ``Those people (censors) were used to making hypocritical
propaganda,'' Wu grumbled in a recent interview. ``People who have
feudal and ultra-left ideas and bureaucrats ... get in the way of
our work.''
   Even the censors, however, have been unable to stop the cascade
of domestic and international honors awarded in the past four years
to Wu's movies and those of young directors who work under him at
the Xian Film Studio in China's ancient capital.
   Since Wu became its director in 1983, the debt-ridden studio in
arid northwestern China has become a prolific producer of
hauntingly beautiful, technically innovative movies that have
raised China's standing in the international film community. Many
in one way or another also have been seen as affronts to socialism.
   For example, Wu's own ``Old Well,'' about a poor village's
efforts to dig a well, won top honors last year at the Tokyo
International Film Festival and a special prize at the Hawaii
International Film festival and received critical acclaim in New
York.
   But its release to prudish Chinese audiences was delayed for
months because of the movie's depiction of a love triangle,
including several kissing scenes of unusual passion.
   ``The Black Cannon,'' directed by Huang Jianxing, one of Wu's
stable of young directors, aroused heated debate because it
attacked mindless bureaucracy. It eventually was named best movie
of 1985 by China's Ministry of Broadcast, Film and Television.
   Another Xian studio release, ``The Horse Thief,'' directed by
Tian Zhuangzhuang, never was shown to general Chinese audiences
because of its depiction of poverty among Tibetan horsemen.
   From his brick office compound with peeling paint and leaking
pipes, the 48-year-old Wu said he wants to expand the limits of
what is acceptable in Chinese filmmaking, largely restricted since
1949 to socialist morality tales.
   Wu said the studio does not seek to create controversy, but it
often results because he and his fellow directors are trying to
depict the often harsh realities of life in China.
   This frightens conservative bureaucrats accustomed to propaganda
movies, he said: ``They lived illusions. They cannot accept any
movie that reflects the dark side of life.''
   It's a side of life Wu knows well. He was born in the mountains
of Shaanxi province, north of Xian, where perpetual drought keeps
many peasants in poverty. During the 1966-76 far-leftist Cultural
Revolution, he was denounced as a rightist and paraded through
Xian's streets wearing a signboard proclaiming his political sins.
   Afterward, he said, he went home and ``shut my door and
studied'' for the rest of the tumultuous decade, during which China
made almost no movies.
   Wu is willing to take risks not only for his own movies but
those of other directors at the Xian studio _ one reason it has
attracted talented young directors and cinematographers.
   On his movie, ``The Black Cannon,'' Huang said: ``The moment we
saw the film for the first time we knew it would be controversial.
   ``But we had a common idea,'' he said pointing to Wu, ``that
this film should reflect life. We felt some pressure when the film
was not (immediately) approved. But Mr. Wu said at one meeting if
problems occurred he would be held responsible.''
   Another attraction is Wu's readiness to give young directors
free rein.
   Asked if he gives advice to the less experienced, 34-year-old
Huang, Wu laughed and said, ``He does fine on his own. If I were to
help him ... I might stifle him.
   ``There would be great prosperity in China's literature and arts
if all artistic leaders followed my example: to let artists do what
they like.''
   Wu is harsh in his criticism of standard Chinese movie fare.
``Sixty percent of Chinese movies are seriously lacking,'' he said.
But he is no kinder to foreign movies.
   He disliked Steven Spielberg's ``Empire of the Sun,'' partly
filmed in Shanghai, about the Japanese invasion of China in World
War II. Wu also said he does not seek to copy Western movies.
   He says his studio's movies are the best being made in China
now, and was confident his own ``Old Well'' will sweep the Chinese
critics' and government awards for best movie of 1987.
   Several upcoming Xian movies appear ripe to arouse debate: one
is about army chief Peng Dehuai, purged in 1958 for daring to
criticize Mao Tse-tung; another concerns three youths whose lives
are failures despite their efforts to get ahead.
   ``Maybe some people will think it's too gray,'' Huang said of
the latter movie, which he is directing, to be called ``Floating
Out of the Sea.''
   His own output is relatively slim. In addition to co-directing
two movies, he has directed just three: ``Old Well,'' ``Life''
(1984) and ``River Without a Buoy'' (1983). All three have received
prizes at home or abroad.
   The demands of running a studio that employs 1,450 and is
perpetually in debt will keep him from starting his next movie
before next year, he said.
   Will it be controversial?
   ``Yes,'' Wu said emphatically, using one of his few English
words. ``Definitely.''

<HEAD>Indonesia's Suharto Starts New Term Amid Discord</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The People's Consultative Assembly has
closed shop for another five years after an 11-day session marked
by unprecedented discord.
   A public outburst by an army general, a dispute over the vice
presidency and previously unheard of votes on policy matters upset
the script at what is usually a pre-arranged ceremonial occasion.
   The assembly is supposed to ``elect'' the president and vice
president and approve state policy guidelines. It consists of the
500 members of Parliament chosen through a general election last
April and another 500 people appointed by President Suharto.
   The constitution describes the assembly as the nation's supreme
lawmaking body. In fact, Suharto rules the world's fifth most
populous country with the support of the armed forces and
participatory democracy is limited.
   Five factions in the assembly acclaimed Suharto as president for
a fifth five-year term. The factions include three political
parties, the military and appointees from different regions.
   State Secretary Sudharmono was sworn in unopposed as vice
president only after Jailani Naro of the Moslem-based United
Development Party withdrew at the last minute.
   ``I didn't withdraw. I was pulled out by my party,'' Naro told a
news conference.
   Earlier in the session, Naro's party caused the assembly to
depart from tradition by voting for the first time ever to break a
deadlock.
   Political custom calls for ``musjawarah,'' or negotiating for as
long as it takes to reach consensus. Some authorities dislike
voting as a practice they associate with Western-style democracy.
   The Moslem faction was outvoted 280-28 in committee on its
request to add a clause to election rules stating that ``general
elections should be held in a fair and honest manner.'' Opponents
maintained this was already embodied in the regulations.
   The Moslem group lost by equally lopsided margins on proposals
to reject Javanese mysticism as part of religion and subsidize
Islamic boarding schools.
   The vice presidency is a largely ceremonial position. But with
the 66-year-old Suharto starting what is assumed will be his last
term, his running mate would be well-placed to stake a claim as
heir to the presidency.
   Stepping out as vice president is Umar Wirahadikusumah, 64, a
retired general and Suharto's former comrade-in-arms. Umar kept a
low profile during his one term and was never regarded as having
presidential ambitions.
   Constitutional procedures for succession exist, but do not take
into account the widespread mystical belief that the national
leader must be blessed with a divine ``mandate'' before one has a
right to rule.
   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 170 million people are
considered at least nominally Moslem. But ``dukuns,'' or
soothsayers, have a wide following and Suharto rules with the help
of Javanese spiritual advisers, informed sources say.
   Suharto and the late President Sukarno are the only presidents
Indonesia has had since independence from the Dutch after World War
II. Economic chaos, an attempted coup and bloodshed in the last
months of Sukarno's rule were supposed to be signs that he had lost
the divine mandate. Sukarno died in 1970.
   Sudharmono, who is 61, the is leader of Golkar, the government
political party. As minister in charge of the state secretariat
since 1966, he has been boss of the country's 2.6 million civil
servants.
   Once known as ``Suharto's doorman'' because he wielded power for
years by controlling access to the president, Sudharmono is a
retired army general. His background is in military law not field
command, however, and not all in the officer corps welcomed his
nomination by Golkar.
   Military sources who insisted on anonymity said some generals
supported instead the newly appointed armed forces commander, Gen.
Try Sutrisno, 52, a popular figure and a former Suharto aide.
   One military figure, Gen. Ibrahim Saleh, startled the assembly
session when he took the microphone and said: ``We Indonesian
soldiers who believe in God and defend honesty and justice have
heard rumors that the nomination of the vice president is not being
fairly and correctly carried out.''
   ``There are certain things that we feel are against our
conscience,'' he added but then was escorted out by other generals
of the military faction before he could finish his statement.
   Former armed forces commander Gen. L.B. Murdani told reporters
later that Saleh did not reflect the views of the armed forces.

<TEXT>
   The National Park Service has proposed
landmark status for the farm of Whittaker Chambers, whose
allegations about infiltration of the American government fueled
the fires of the Red Scare and whose writings deeply influenced
President Reagan and other conservatives.
   Forty years ago, in a strange and symbolic incident, Chambers,
then a Time magazine editor, opened a hollowed-out pumpkin on Pipe
Creek Farm and retrieved microfilmed documents that connected Alger
Hiss, a longtime State Department official, to Communist activities
a decade earlier.
   Chambers, who had renounced his Communist past, accused Hiss of
having belonged to a secret cell of underground Communists that
passed documents to the Soviets in the 1930s. Chambers claimed they
had been close associates at one time.
   Hiss sued Chambers for libel, but the tables turned as the
``pumpkin papers'' sealed Hiss' fate before the House Un-American
Activities Committee. Criminal indictments followed and after two
trials, Hiss was sent to prison on March 22, 1951. His libel suit
was dismissed in 1951.
   Although he served 44 months in prison after being convicted of
perjuring himself before the committee by denying under oath that
he ferried the documents to Chambers in 1938, he has maintained his
innocence.
   Reached at his New York home last week, the 83-year-old Hiss
said he had no comment on the effort to honor Chambers with a
landmark.
   He added: ``I will have something to say about him in the latter
part of May,'' when he publishes what he termed a
semi-autobiographical book.
   After turning in his former associates, Chambers, who had slept
for years with a gun fearing retribution, retreated with his family
to the farm's 390 rolling acres, where he tended to the land and
wrote about his experiences until his death in 1961.
   One of the conservatives most influenced by Chambers' 1952
autobiographical volume ``Witness'' was a young Californian. Ronald
Reagan's own book ``Where's the Rest of Me?'' includes references
to Chambers.
   ``He talks about the deep impact that Whittaker Chambers had on
him. He said reading `Witness' was one of the most profoundly
moving experiences of his life,'' according to White House chief
speechwriter Tony Dolan.
   Dolan said Reagan was so stirred by the story of a Communist who
came to see the evils of totalitarian regimes that he bestowed a
posthumous Medal of Freedom on Chambers in 1984.
   Reagan and Dolan discussed the president's interest in Chambers;
a subsequent exchange between Dolan and Secretary of the Interior
Donald Hodel led to the site nomination.
   ``Hodel is a very devoted conservative, very devoted to the
president,'' Dolan said.
   The landmark designation for the Chambers farm depends on
approval from the National Park System Advisory Board, which is
scheduled to meet on April 26, and then from Hodel. It would
provide the property with a plaque and place it in a league with
more than 1,800 other sites, from ships to presidential homes, with
national historical value.
   Historians point out that the Hiss-Chambers case polarized the
political world, fueled the paranoia of the Cold War, and rocketed
then-congressman Richard M. Nixon to prominence as one of Hiss' top
interrogators.
   According to park service historian Barry Mackintosh, Nixon made
at least two unpublicized visits to the Chambers farm ``and became
convinced that Chambers was telling the truth about his association
with Hiss.'' Years later, Nixon would return to Westminster to
speak with Chambers about his desire to be president, but Chambers
wrote supporter and National Review founder William F. Buckley Jr.
that he found Nixon inadequate for the job.
   Asked why the Reagan administration chose to honor his father
with a landmark nomination, John Chambers, a former journalist now
serving as deputy staff director of the Joint Committee on Printing
in Washington, said Whittaker Chambers ``left behind a literary
legacy and a legacy of action, a legacy of conscience, and this is
the place where some of this was formulated, and one of the places
where it came be focused.
   ``It's an honor that we welcome,'' said Chambers, who has lived
at Pipe Creek Farm off and on since the age of 2.
   Maintaining it as a working farm is, he said, his way of paying
tribute to his father's conversion to a simple life of manual
labor, expressed in the volume ``Cold Friday.''
   ``Here I determined to root the lives of my children. ... I
meant to root them in this way in their nation. For I hold that a
nation is first of all the soil on which it lives, for which it is
willing to die,'' Whittaker Chambers wrote.
   ``This was all there was to give _ the ground beneath their
feet. I meant to give it to them not only against the forces of
open revolution but also against that suffocating materialism,
which, more than want or hunger, recruits the forces of revolution
in the West.''
   According to Dolan, ``Chambers felt there was a death struggle
going on in the world between freedom and totalitarianism. And as a
matter of fact, he felt (the West) would probably lose that
struggle.
   ``What he didn't count on was Ronald Reagan. ... He could not
the future.
   In light of the Delaware ruling, Henley said it has moved to
dismiss a suit challenging Santa Fe's restructuring and other
actions by Santa Fe's board.
   Earlier this week, Henley announced its own restructuring, which
would include raising $2.5 billion in new bank financing to fund
acquisitions. At the time, Henley Chairman Michael Dingman
indicated the company was ``on the prowl'' for new takeover
prospects.
   Separately, Olympia & York announced it has again extended by
six days, until next Wednesday, the expiration date of its tender
offer of $17.50 a share for up to 14 million Santa Fe shares, which
would boost its stake to 19.6 percent. To date, 4.77 million shares
have been tender, the company said.

   The southwest African nation of Angola has known
only war since independence from Portugal in 1975. A Marxist
government is in place in Luanda, the capital, backed by the Soviet
Union and Cuba. In the countryside is a U.S.-backed guerrilla force
called UNITA. In between are people often suffering the bullets,
mines and bombs of war. An Associated Press correspondent had a
rare look at the war recently during a tour of an Angolan war zone.

<DATELINE>CUEMBA, Angola (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Land mines, people with legs blown off,
orphans, abandoned farm fields, hunger, the thunder of artillery in
the distance, the clatter of helicopter gunships overhead. All this
is part of daily life for the people of Bie, a highland province in
central Angola shattered by a dozen years of guerrilla war.
   For a group of foreign reporters visiting this former farming
town and the provincial capital of Kuito saw clear evidence of the
heavy fighting between government forces and rebel guerrillas.
   The war has left its mark on everyone, everything.
   Cuemba, set on a rise in undulating grassy countryside, is
ringed by trenches and machine-gun emplacements visible from the
air, the least hazardous way to reach the town.
   Approaching Cuemba from Kuito in a Casa CN-235 troop transport,
a short-takeoff and landing aircraft, the visitors accompanied by
government guides saw roads and railways empty of all traffic.
   The fading outlines of abandoned farmlands farther out from
Cuemba were also visible from the air, contrasting with orderly
rows of lush growth, mainly corn, seen outside Kuito, 87 miles to
the west, where the fighting of recent months has not been so
intense.
   It is much the same in other parts of Angola where the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), supported by
the United States and South Africa, is fighting a
Soviet-Cuban-backed Marxist government in Luanda, the capital.
   An estimated 40,000 Cuban troops are in Angola, along with more
than 1,000 Soviet military advisers. The United States sends arms
to the rebels and South Africa lends air and ground-troop support.
   UNITA claims to have full control of about a third of Angola _
in the southeast and east, where about 2 million of Angola's 8.1
million people live. In the area it calls ``liberated Angola,''
UNITA has established a government and runs schools and hospitals.
The guerrillas say they operate in another third of the country
while the government maintains full control of the rest.
   Flying is perhaps the only safe way to travel in many parts of
the country. Thousands of villagers have lost one or both legs to
UNITA land mines, the government says. Hundreds of others have been
killed, leaving children orphaned and making physical disability a
common condition.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross, which operates
several physical rehabilitation centers in the region, last year
estimated 15,000 Angolan army soldiers and 15,000 civilians have
lost limbs in land mine explosions.
   On the airport road in Kuito, the visitors saw three women who
had lost legs moving along on crutches or with canes. In the city
there were more.
   There were children too, in tattered, filthy clothes _ some too
small, some too large, clearly the only clothing they owned.
   In Cuemba, where UNITA has been fighting for control of the
region since Jan. 25, children and older villagers show signs of
malnutrition.
   Bullet holes snake across the walls of many houses. The tracks
of the strategic Benguela railroad, which links landlocked southern
African countries to the Atlantic Ocean, are rusty and caked with
thick, dried mud. It was obvious no trains have been through for a
long time.
   Hairdressers, cafes, clothing and photography stores, printing
presses and transport companies lie abandoned. Their windows are
broken and paint from before Angola gained independence from
Portugal in 1975 is peeling from the frames. The municipal swimming
pools in Cuemba and Kuito are long out of use.
   Government forces killed 180 UNITA guerrillas in a recent
three-day battle around Cuemba, the Defense Ministry says. The
rebels had not shelled the airport's packed-earth runway or taken
control of the town as they had claimed.
   Government forces clearly were in control on this day.

<HEAD>CUEMBA: this day.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The first foreign reporters to visit the region since UNITA
launched a major offensive to seize Cuemba and Munhango, 40 miles
to the east, were met by the fit and well-equipped Angolan army
unit stationed in the town.
   The commander, Maj. Jose Walter Freitas Gomes, displayed
weapons, including anti-tank missiles, mines and mortars that he
said were made in the United States and captured from the rebels.
   No markings, however, could be seen on the weapons to indicate
where they were made.
   At the end of their 50-minute visit to the town, the reporters
were seen off by a small crowd, most of them children, and there
was a momentary disturbance.
   A drum sounded somewhere in the distance and the children
suddenly streaked off in fear, mistakenly believing the noise was
artillery fire. Their lives are full of those sounds.
   Leaving Cuemba, the Casa CN-235 lifted into the air long before
reaching the end of the runway, climbing almost vertically in a
spiral, to gain altitude fast and to get away from any UNITA
snipers or artillery.
   For the same reason, landing had been a reverse of this
maneuver, dropping 21,000 feet to Cuemba's airport in four minutes.
The Angolans call this corkscrew drop ``the spiral of death.''
   In October, the International Red Cross suspended operations in
Bie after its sole cargo plane in Angola, a Hercules C-130, crashed
after takeoff from Kuito Airport following what appeared to be an
engine fire.
   Four people aboard the plane were killed, along with a woman and
child on the ground. The Red Cross began operating in the area
again in late February, flying in food and medicine.
   The Red Cross resumed the services after rebel leaders at
UNITA's Jamba bush headquarters in southern Angola said they would
permit relief operations.
   Angola's minister of state for inspection and control, Kundi
Payama, said in Kuito that UNITA has supporters and guerrillas
among the population of Bie. He noted that Jonas Savimbi, UNITA's
leader, was born in the province.
   ``There are people working their family plots in this area who
put down their hoes at night, dig up their hidden guns and become
UNITA raiders, planting mines and laying ambushes,'' Payama said.
   ``These things happen if you can't feed the people and they
can't get decent housing, or find a job or work most of the fields.
   ``We've got lots of food at the (Atlantic) port of Lobito, but
getting it here is the problem,'' he said. Lobito is the starting
point of the Benguela railroad but rebel attacks have made it
impossible for trains to travel as far as Cuemba.
   ``Every time we try to bring a food convoy here by road, it gets
attacked and burned,'' Payama added. He said the people understood,
however, that the government was trying to get food through.
   Cuban soldiers were seen getting off a plane at Kuito Airport
and others were in evidence in Huambo, capital of the neighboring
province of the same name.
   Soviet-built MiG-21 jetfighters, MI-25 helicopter gunships and
MI-17 transport helicopters at the airports of both cities were
indications of the government's concern about the guerrilla
campaign in the area.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: for AIDS.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Instead, they expect it will be, at most, part of a growing
armamentarium against AIDS. The FDA said there are now more than
100 drugs being tested against AIDS or against the opportunistic
diseases that attack bodies weakened by AIDS.
   Broder at NCI is conducting tests that team AZT with other
drugs, principally one called ddC, for dideoxycytidine. He is
conducting tests in which the drugs are alternated.
   ``I believe we eventually be using a combination of several
drugs,'' said Dr. Glen Mathisen, chief of infectious diseases at
Olive View Medical Center in Los Angeles.
   Mathisen and others note that drug combinations have been used
successfully against major killers such as leukemia and
tuberculosis. Most cancer chemotherapy includes a combination
skillfully administered in cycles.
   AZT's full range of uses are still being explored because the
drug now is limited only to patients at a late stage of AIDS or of
AIDS-related complex, or ARC.
   Barry said studies are under way using AZT to protect medical
workers who have been exposed to the blood or other body fluids of
AIDS patients during treatment. There have been more than 1,000
such reported incidents and its hoped that AZT given within hours
of the exposure will prevent development of AIDS.
   Other studies are exploring the use of AZT for infants born with
the disease, or for people who test positive for the HIV virus, but
who do not have the AIDS sympthoms.
   But no matter what else is learned about AZT, the important
thing is that the drug has bought time, said Broder.
   ``It's not the magic bullet,'' he said. ``But it's keeping
people alive. We can now worry about things like longterm toxicity
of the drug. Before AZT, they didn't live long enough for that to
be a concern.''

<HEAD>Gallaudet's New President: `We Can Do Anything _ Except Hear'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Before I. King Jordan Jr. lost his hearing, he
knew nothing about Gallaudet University. Like many District of
Columbia residents, he drove by it frequently without so much as a
curious thought.
   Now, Jordan has taken over the 124-year-old liberal arts
university for the hearing impaired. As its first deaf president,
he has become an important symbol to the non-hearing, even those
who have nothing to do with Gallaudet.
   ``It's overwhelming,'' Jordan said. ``I came here after I
accepted the appointment; the students were crying, hugging me. The
emotion is still very high. It's a wonderful feeling.''
   ``When I go off campus, I ride in the Gallaudet University
station wagon and people blow their horns and wave at me. I can see
people recognize me.
   During the last week, the campus has been empty while its 2,200
students, who pushed Jordan into power, took spring break.
   On Monday, they'll return, and Jordan will hold a celebration
assembly to reinforce what has become his motto: ``Deaf people can
do anything except hear.''
   Jordan rose to the presidency March 13 on a wave of student
protest that followed the decision by Gallaudet's trustees to
appoint a hearing woman, Elisabeth Zinser, as president.
   The outcry led to Zinser's resignation and the hiring of Jordan,
who had been among two deaf people also considered for the job.
   ``What you saw was something really unique,'' Jordan said of the
seven days of protest.
   ``It was not dissatisfaction with the university administration
at all. What you saw was the deaf community, the entire national
and international deaf community finally reach a point where they
knew it was time to speak out about their frustrations at not being
in the top leadership positions in the field.
   ``The conditions were just perfect. The leadership in the
student body was tremendous.
   ``I can't tell you how proud I am of the students, how well
organized they were. How they guaranteed that there would be no
violence, no damage and they carried that out. There was never
anyone hurt or any damage done.''
   Virtually all the students were in on the demonstrations. They
marched, they rallied, they blocked entrances to the campus and
they convinced older deaf people that the time was now to take
charge.
   Jordan originally threw his support behind Zinser, saying he had
hoped to persuade the students to compromise for the good of the
university.
   ``Overnight, literally overnight, it became clear to me that it
was getting bigger and bigger by the minute and that I had misread
it, that I had made a mistake,'' he said.
   ``I don't think anyone realized the support there was on the
outside. I've never seen a movement that was universal support
before.
   ``When the group marched from here to the Capitol, people came
out of their houses and applauded. People who were tied up in
traffic, instead of blowing their horns impatiently and wanting the
march to be over, blew their horns in support, got out of their
cars and waved.
   ``People lining the way between here and the Capitol were
signing `I love you.' It was probably a once-in-a-lifetime
movement.''
   Jordan's deafness has not impaired his speech, but he uses a
sign language interpreter to understand hearing people. Though he
can read lips, he says a lengthy conversation is exhausting without
the help of signing.
   He lost his hearing in 1965 when he was 21 and stationed in
Washington with the Navy. A motorcycle accident caused multiple
skull fractures, severed his auditory nerve and put him in the
hospital for a year.
   When he recovered, someone suggested he enroll at Gallaudet.
Until then, he knew nothing about the school.
   ``Before I became deaf, I drove by here regularly, a few times a
week, and I had no idea what it was,'' he said.
   Though his family was very supportive, deafness had never been a
part of their lives. Growing up in Glen Riddle, Pa., Jordan never
even knew a deaf person.
   His father was a shipping clerk, his mother an office clerk, and
his life with two older sisters and one younger brother had been
typical small town America.
   ``When I first came to Gallaudet I was going through a period of
adjustment to deafness. One of the things that was easy for me to
do was to lose myself in my studies. I found that I was very good
at it. While I couldn't hear, I could read and I'd write, and
became a very strong student. I made a conscious decision to become
as good a student as I could.''
   After getting his bachelor's degree in psychology, Jordan went
on to receive a masters' degree and PhD from the University of
Tennessee. There were no interpreters to translate lectures, so
Jordan read the professors' lips and got help from his hearing
classmates.
   Along the way he married ``a hearing, but very supportive
woman'' and now has a 17-year-old son and 15-year-old daughter.
   He returned to Gallaudet in 1973 as a professor of psychology
and became dean of the College of Arts and Sciences in 1986.
   As it's president, he said he will encourage deaf people to seek
teaching positions at Gallaudet, but he will not put any quotas on
the number of deaf people who should hold either staff or
administrative positions.
   About 30 percent of the professors are deaf. Fewer
administrators are.
   Academica is becoming a better career program for deaf people,
Jordan said. In the past the only opportunity for deaf people would
have been Gallaudet.
   He said he knows of deaf people in other schools using
interpreters to teach hearing students.
   ``I really believe that the events of last week show that even
when someone needs an interpeter, still there can be clear,
meaningful communication,'' he said.

   The U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened to
$12.44 billion in January, but economists say the 1.9 percent
increase reported by the government was too small to cause alarm.
   Exports fell by 10 percent to $22.33 billion and imports by 6
percent to $34.77 billion, the Commerce Department said Thursday.
   Analysts said the export drop was expected and happens every
January. But the decline in imports was greeted as good news and a
further indication that the trade balance is slowly improving.

   Industry analysts said Thursday that the $78-a-share tender

   The offer topped a cash bid of $73 a share, or $2.1 billion,

   Individuals and businesses voluntarily paid
only 83.2 percent of the federal income taxes they owed last year,
leaving the government with a tax gap of $84.9 billion, the
Internal Revenue Service said.
   More than half the shortage reported Thursday was attributed to
individuals who file tax returns but fail to report income from
moonlighting, a small business or other legal non-wage sources.
   IRS Commissioner Lawrence B. Gibbs said closing the gap may
require a basic change of attitude among taxpayers.

   R.H. Macy & Co. Inc.'s bid for Federated
Department Stores Inc. suffered a setback when the Securities and
Exchange Commission said it considered a sweetened rival offer by
Campeau Corp. to be an amendment to a previous offer rather than an
entirely new bid.
   A federal judge had sought the SEC's opinion on Macy's
contention that the Campeau move constituted a new offer. The SEC
offered its opinion on Thursday.
   If U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand agrees with the SEC, the
Campeau bid could expire as scheduled before the April 4 expiration
of Macy's competing offer. The earlier deadline could pressure
Federated shareholders into tendering their shares to Campeau.

   A better-than-expected January trade deficit helped drive the
Dow Jones average of 30 industrials to a post-crash high, while a
report showing sustained factory usage underscored signs of
economic strength.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 21.72 points in a
late buying spree Thursday to close at 2,086.04, the market
barometer's best showing since October's stock market crash.
Analysts credited the better-than-expected trade deficit and
takeover-related buying for the strong performance.
   Separately, the Federal Reserve reported the nation's factories,
mines and utilities operated at 82.4 percent of capacity in
February, sustaining that rate for the third consecutive month.
   The Commerce Department reported a slight widening of the U.S.
merchandise trade deficit to $12.44 billion, but economists said
the 1.9 percent increase was too small to cause alarm.
   Exports fell in a seasonally-expected trend, this time by 10
percent to $22.33 billion.
   But economists were more enthusiastic over a 6 percent dip in
imports, to $34.77 billion, which they say is a firmer indication
the trade balance slowly is improving.
   January's deficit was up from $12.20 billion in December, but
down from the gaps of $13.21 billion in November and $17.63 billion
in October.
   If the January level continued for 12 consecutive months, it
would yield an annual trade deficit of about $149 billion. In 1987,
the merchandise trade deficit was $171.22 billion.
   The January report represented a slight setback after two
consecutive monthly improvements, but there were some bright spots.
   The deficit with Japan _ still the largest single-country
imbalance _ fell by 17.6 percent in January to $3.95 billion, its
lowest level since December 1986.
   The United States showed its first surplus in nearly three years
with Britain, with exports topping imports by $75 million. For all
Western Europe, the deficit declined 51 percent, to $1.33 billion.
   The trade news helped support the dollar and pushed interest
rates lower in the credit markets, where the yield on the
Treasury's bellwether 30-year issue fell to 8.53 percent from
Wednesday's 8.60 percent.
   The Federal Reserve's report showing sustained high factory use
helped underscore economists' contentions that the industrial
sector remained strong.
   Before the year began, some experts had expressed fears that the
economy could weaken significantly due to widespread cutbacks in
production as businesses tried to work off a huge supply of unsold
goods built up in late 1987.
   While high inventories have led to cuts in auto production, many
other industries, such as textiles, chemicals, and paper, have
continued to have high operating rates.

<HEAD>U.S., Europeans to Discuss Dispute Over Airbus Subsidies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CONSTANCE, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and European trade officials
are holding a new round of talks in the lengthy dispute over
government subsidies to the Airbus aircraft manufacturing
consortium.
   But both sides remain far apart on the long-simmering issue of
subsidies to Airbus, which the United States contends are unfair,
and U.S. trade envoys are not optimistic about the outcome of the
meeting.
   ``The expectations are very low,'' an official close to the
negotiations said Thursday.
   The U.S. delegation, led by trade representative Clayton
Yeutter, is expected to use today's meeting to increase pressure on
the economic ministers representing the four Airbus countries to
abolish or at least scale down the payments, sources said.
   U.S. officials have grown impatient over the slow progress of
the talks and are looking for indications that the Airbus nations
at least are willing to agree to reduce some of their support,
sources said.
   ``The Americans at a minimum want the Europeans to give a signal
that they are willing to accept some effective discipline in regard
to subsidies,'' an informed diplomatic source, who asked not to be
identified, said earlier this week.
   The United States estimates the four countries involved in the
Airbus Industrie consortium _ France, Britain, West Germany and
Spain _ have given $10 billion to the consortium since it was
created 17 years ago.
   Willy de Clercq, the European Economic Community's external
relations commissioner, said last week there was a ``realistic
chance'' of settling the dispute. But he also said the EEC
governments ``cannot entirely renounce'' state aid payments to
Airbus.
   De Clercq predicted an agreement would require ``further rounds
of very difficult negotiations.''
   The United States maintains that subsidies to Airbus are unfair
to U.S. aircraft makers in the wide-body, long-haul passenger jet
market.
   The Airbus nations contend the subsidies do not distort trade
and are allowed under civil aircraft provisions of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   The EEC also argues that U.S. aircraft manufacturers long have
enjoyed huge, indirect subsidies through military contracts from
the Pentagon and millions in government research grants.
   According to EEC figures, the United States exports $5 billion
worth of aircraft and aircraft parts to Western Europe per year,
compared to $3 billion of European aircraft exports annually to the
United States.
   The EEC says outstanding European orders and options for U.S.
aircraft total $23 billion, while U.S. orders and options for
Airbus stand at $13 billion.
   The United States contends Airbus has 35 percent of the world
market, a figure the EEC rejects as far too high.
   The EEC claims U.S. manufacturers still dominate the worldwide
civilian aircraft market, with Boeing controlling 49 percent of the
market and McDonnell Douglas Corp. 17 percent, while Airbus has a
25 percent share.
   The United States has threatened to retaliate against Airbus if
the negotiations fail, despite a recent decision by the four Airbus
ministers to have Airbus managers enter into direct negotiations
with McDonnell Douglas on a possible joint project.
   The aim of the talks is to see whether the two sides could
collaborate on one or more new airplanes.
   Under the proposal, the new aircraft would not compete with
existing models.
   But diplomatic sources told The Associated Press that the move
was unlikely to reduce tensions over the subsidy issue.
   ``It may well be helpful for Airbus and McDonnell Douglas to
agree on a joint project, but that will not solve the core problem
of the current subsidies,'' said another diplomatic source, who
also declined to be identified further.

<HEAD>SEC Tells Judge Campeau Bid Is an Amended Offer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Campeau Corp. has gotten a boost in one aspect
of its court fight to gain the upper hand in its attempted take
over of Federated Department Stores Inc. but still faces major
obstacles.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday agreed with
Campeau's contention that its sweetened buyout offer for Federated
constituted an amendment to a previous proposal rather than an
entirely new bid.
   The SEC opinion was sought by a federal judge hearing a lawsuit
brought over the issue by rival bidder R.H. Macy & Co. Inc.
   If U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand agrees with the SEC, Campeau
could let its tender offer expire as scheduled before the April 4
expiration of Macy's competing offer, which is supported by
Federated's management.
   That could pressure Federated shareholders into tendering their
shares to Campeau, because of the earlier deadline. Macy is suing
to force Campeau to keep its offer open longer.
   But although Campeau got a boost in the dispute over its tender
offer, it still must win a victory in its challenge to Federated's
``poison pill'' takeover defense.
   Both Campeau and Macy have bid more than $6 billion for
Federated, one of the nation's biggest department store operators.
   In a ``friend of the court'' brief, the SEC told Sand the
revised bid Campeau announced on March 2 was not a new offer, and
as such did not have to remain open for 20 business days past its
publication.
   Earlier this week, Sand ordered both companies' offers to remain
open for three business days after he rules on Campeau's lawsuit
seeking to invalidate Federated's poison pill.
   Campeau has told Sand its offer could not proceed while the
poison pill remained in effect. The pill would allow current
Federated shareholders to buy more of the company's stock at a
steep discount unless the board of directors withdrew the
provision, making a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive.
   It was not known when Sand would make his ruling.
   Macy had no comment on the SEC's opinion, said Maureen Milano, a
spokeswoman for the retailer.
   Macy is offering $77.35 a share in cash for 70.43 million
Federated shares, for a total of $5.4 billion. Macy would exchange
shares in the merged company, Macy's-Federated Inc., and issue
convertible debt securities for the remainder of Federated's 89.5
million outstanding shares, which analysts have estimated would
produce a total value of $6.3 billion.
   Campeau's bid is a two-step, all-cash package that would be
worth $68 a share, or $6.18 billion. It is offering $75 each for
70.5 million Federated shares, and would acquire the remaining
stock for $44 cash per share in a subsequent merger.
   Federated stock fell 62{ cents to $62.50 a share Thursday on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   In a related matter, the head of the Federal Trade Commission
refused Thursday to appear before a House panel reviewing the
proposed Federated takeover.
   Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, said FTC Chairman Daniel Oliver and
FTC Commissioner Terry Calvani told the House Energy and Commerce
transportation subcommittee they would neither testify nor turn
over documents on the agency's review of any possible
anticompetitive effects of a merger between Federated and Campeau.
   Luken said he was considering subpoenaing the officials if they
did not testify voluntarily.
   Robert Paul, general counsel for the FTC, said the commissioners
decided not to give the documents to the subcommittee because
several weeks ago the panel released to the press an FTC staff memo
on the Campeau bid the agency considered confidential.
   Federated owns 650 stores including the Bloomingdale's,
Burdine's, Filene's, Foley's, Lazarus and Rich's department store
chains; Ralphs supermarkets; Gold Circle discount stores; and Main
Street and Children's Place specialty stores.
   Macy owns nearly 100 department and specialty stores, while
Campeau owns Allied Stores Corp.

   The head of the Federal Trade Commission has
been asked to justify his refusal to give Congress documents on the
agency's review of Campeau Corp.'s proposed takeover of Federated
Department Stores Inc.
   The request was made Thursday by Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio,
after FTC Chairman Daniel Oliver and FTC Commissioner Terry Calvani
refused to appear before the House Energy and Commerce
transportation subcommittee.
   ``I'm a little outraged at this conduct,'' Luken said following
the hearing. ``They're setting up roadblocks.''
   Luken, chairman of the subcommittee, said if the officials
continue to refuse to comply, ``I will obviously be thinking about
proceeding with subpoenas'' and possibly contempt citations.
   Campeau and R.H. Macy & Co. Inc. are locked in a takeover battle
for Cincinnati-based Federated. The congressman has accused the FTC
of failing to thoroughly investigate the hostile takeover bid by
Campeau, which preceded the friendly takeover agreement between
Federated by Macy's.
   Robert Paul, the FTC general counsel, said the commissioners
decided not to give the documents to the subcommittee because
several weeks ago the panel released to the press an FTC staff memo
on the Campeau bid the agency considered confidential.
   ``There's tremendous concern on their part that this was very,
very bad precedent,'' said Paul. ``Chairman Oliver and Commissioner
Calvani are not going to be party to producing documents
further...until there is assurance by the subcommittee that this
type of thing will not happen again.''
   Paul said that if there was an FTC investigation of the Macy's
bid and the commissioners rendered a decision, they might be
subject to allegations by private parties that the agency acted
because of congressional pressure.
   ``The more the Congress acts on this, puts pressure on us, the
greater the possibility of arguing that we have been influenced by
Congress, that we've been tainted,'' said Paul.
   Luken said 80 percent to 90 percent of the information marked
confidential in the FTC memo released by the subcommittee was
contained in public filings and that the rest is just
``chit-chat.'' He said Federated and Campeau were told the memo was
being given to the subcommittee and neither objected.
   Luken asked that Oliver and Calvani submit a legal memo giving
their reason for not providing the documents and for not appearing
before the panel.
   FTC Commissioners Mary Azcuenaga and Andrew Strenio, who
appeared before the subcommittee Thursday, said they had voted to
turn over the requested documents but had failed to obtain the
necessary majority vote to do so.
   Federated operates about 650 stores in 36 states and had sales
exceeding $11 billion in 1987.
   Campeau is a retailing and real estate development company based
in Toronto.

   A $1 billion federal cash infusion to First
RepublicBank Corp. has helped stanch a run on deposits, but federal
officials say the advance is only an interim step to steady the
troubled bank holding company.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s cash advance on Thursday
helped calm jittery depositors and slow runoff of deposits that has
drained an undisclosed amount of reserves from the ailing company,
bank spokesman Joseph C. Bowles said.
   ``As soon as the FDIC action was made available to the public,
the deposit outflow stopped,'' Bowles said.
   In Washington, FDIC Chairman William Seidman said his agency was
talking to private investors about participating in a restructuring
of the company, as a long-term solution to First RepublicBank's
problems.
   In a move intended to stem any ripple effect on the banking
system as a whole, Seidman also pledged his agency to fully protect
all depositors of the banks as well as general creditors.
   That goes beyond the minimum the agency normally would be
expected to insure, which is deposits of $100,000 and less.
   The promise covers money borrowed overnight from other banks by
First RepublicBank to meet the cash rules of the Federal Reserve
Board. However, it does not apply to the holding company and its
bond and note holders.
   ``The action today confirms that all depositors and other
general creditors of First RepublicBank's banks will be fully
protected,'' said Gerald Fronterhouse, First RepublicBank's
chairman and chief executive.
   Bowles and other bank officials refused Thursday to say how much
of the company's deposits had been withdrwan since Tuesday when it
announced its decision to seek federal help.
   Last month, the bank lost $600 million in deposits over a
five-day period amid rumors that it was in danger because of
billions of dollars in bad loans, particularly in real estate.
   But several customers at the company's lead bank in downtown
Dallas indicated they were not worried about losing their deposits.
   ``I have confidence in the people running the bank. It'll
survive,'' said Alex Cochrane.
   Gail Scott said: ``It's pretty scary. I hope they can work it
out.''
   A woman who declined to identify herself said she wasn't worried
because the FDIC insures accounts up to $100,000, and ``before they
go under I will have spent my money.''
   An Associated Press reporter was escorted out of the bank under
guard Thursday as he tried to interview customers and bank
officials.
   George Reagan, investment manager of the Texas Teachers
Retirement System, a major institutional investor that holds
498,000 shares of First RepublicBank stock, said the FDIC money
would provide a cushion for the bank until the economy recovers.
   ``This will allow First Republic to get through the hard times.
No one, especially First Republic, realized that we would go
through such a hard time with the Texas real estate market for so
long,'' he said.
   H.R. ``Bum'' Bright, owner of the Dallas Cowboys and Bright Banc
Savings Association, is the company's largest individual investor
with more than 1 million shares.
   Nine months ago, those shares were worth $24 million; now
they're worth approximately $1.5 million. Bright did not return
repeated telephone calls on Thursday.
   State Treasurer Ann Richards said the federal action ``assures
that all depositors, including the state treasury, are safe.''
   First RepublicBank is one of four state treasury clearing banks,
and as of Wednesday held $152 million in state deposits. Ms.
Richards said the deposits are fully collateralized and therefore
protected.

   Life has gotten sweeter for chocolate
lovers, thanks to a drop in cocoa prices that has translated into
bigger candy bars and could mean future price-cutting promotions.
   The price of raw cocoa _ which typically constitutes up to 20
percent of a typical chocolate bar _ has fallen to five-year lows.
   While that hasn't meant direct reductions in the cost of a
Snickers or Hershey bar at the corner newsstand or vending machine,
it has helped candy makers offer a bigger bar at the same price.
   The near-month cocoa future traded on the Coffee, Sugar and
Cocoa Exchange in New York traded at $1,552 per ton on Thursday,
down from the mid-July price of $2,175. Analysts say abundant
supplies and rising production have depressed prices.
   But cheaper cocoa doesn't directly translate into cheaper bars
because cocoa and chocolate don't have the direct price
relationship of, for example, oil and gasoline or beans and coffee,
industry analysts say.
   While cocoa and its by-products constitute up to 20 percent of a
chocolate bar, about 50 percent of the candy is sugar and the rest
milk, nuts, vanilla or other ingredients, said Susan Smith, a
spokeswoman for the Chocolate Manufacturers Association.
   Hackettstown-based M&M-Mars, a privately-held company considered
to be the nation's argest candy bar maker, has increased the size
of two popular products by about 8 percent in recent years.
   Last fall, M&M-Mars enlarged its Milky Way bar as it had done
with its Snickers bar _ the nation's biggest seller, according to
industry estimates _ the previous year.
   Hans Fiuczynski, a spokesman for M&M-Mars, said the lower cocoa
price ``augmented and abetted'' the decision to increase the bar
size, although he said similar moves by other candy makers also
played a major role.
   ``We did what other people did, not necessarily because of the
price of raw materials,'' Fiuczynski said.
   A spokesman for Hershey Chocolate U.S.A., in Hershey, Pa., said
a drop in cocoa prices and stabilization in the cost of other
ingredients contributed to its decision to boost the size of its
various chocolate bars by 10 percent to 14 percent in July 1986.
   But the price of cocoa ``doesn't have that direct an effect on
us'' in terms of the cost of its products, said spokesman Carl
Anderson.
   Kim Badenhop, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets
Inc., said recent cocoa prices could be considered the lowest in
decades if inflation was taken into account.
   Badenhop predicted the increased cash flow resulting from
cheaper commodity costs could show up in still-bigger bars and more
promotions such as coupons or discounted brands.
   Retailers probably won't pass on their savings to consumers by
cutting the price of an individual chocolate bar, but are likely to
do it by offering a bigger product for the same price, discount
coupons or through other promotions, Badenhop said.
   ``We've been told through the grapevine that has happened with
some of the companies,'' said Ms. Smith.
   Consumers may see direct savings in products such as packages of
candy bars sold in supermarkets or bags of small chocolates, said
Ms. Smith.

<HEAD>Sugarman Goes On The Attack In Bid For Media General</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Television producer Burt Sugarman has
launched a two-pronged attack against Media General Inc., filing a
countersuit against the company and launching a proxy fight to win
three seats on the board of directors.
   Sugarman filed suit Thursday in U.S. District Court against
Media General and each of its directors, asking a judge to order
that his $61.50 per share buyout offer, worth about $1.6 billion be
considered solely by the three directors elected by holders of the
company's publicly-held stock.
   The suit also sought a ruling that shareholders, voting as a
single class, could approve Sugarman's offer by simple majority
vote.
   Separately, Sugarman disclosed in a filing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission that he was undertaking a proxy battle to
place himself and two others in the three seats on Media General's
board for holders of the Class A publicly traded shares.
   The disclosures mark the latest skirmish in the weeks-long
struggle between Sugarman and the family of Media General's
chairman, D. Tennant Bryan, which controls a majority of the
company's voting power.
   The family _ which has rejected Sugarman's overtures repeatedly
_ owns 71 percent of the company's Class B common stock, which is
not publicly traded. The 559,168 Class B shares have the voting
power to elect seven of the company's 10 directors.
   Media General has 28 million publicly-traded Class A shares,
which have one vote each and elect three directors.
   Sugarman, who controls 10 percent of the company's Class A stock
and none of the Class B, has argued that the disproportionate
voting rule doesn't apply if a holder of more than 10 percent of
the company's stock proposes a merger. Media General says its
counsel disagrees.
   Sugarman's suit said the Bryans are thwarting a vote by
stockholders, even though their Class B shares constitute only 1.4
percent of the company's total equity.
   David L. Jordan, a Media General vice president, said the
company's lawyers had reviewed the suit and ``think it is without
merit.''
   Media General sued Sugarman and his companies in federal court
Monday, asking the court to block the takeover attempt and force
Sugarman to sell his 10 percent holding.
   The suit alleges Sugarman submitted incomplete and inaccurate
information to federal regulators about his proposed takeover.
   Sugarman's group includes Barris Industries Inc. of Beverly
Hills, Calif., which produces game shows, and Giant Group Ltd. of
Harleyville, S.C., which makes cement products.
   Media General owns several communications interests, including
Richmond Newspapers Inc., which publishes The Richmond News Leader
and the Richmond Times-Dispatch.

   The dollar rose in Europe early today on the back
of better-than-expected U.S. trade performance in January. Gold
bullion fell.
   The U.S. currency was holding steady at mostly higher levels at
midmorning, and traders said a rally triggered by Thursday's trade
report appeared to be running out of steam.
   The Commerce Department reported Thursday that the U.S.
merchandise trade deficit widened slightly to $12.4 billion in
January from $12.2 billion in December. The market had expected a
shortfall of $12.8 billion.
   A trader in Frankfurt, West Germany, said the dollar was boosted
both by the trade figures and the deployment of U.S. troops to
Honduras. But he said market sentiment was not changed
fundamentally.
   Another jump in the British pound, however, could push the
dollar lower, the trader said. ``The pound is seen as a real
alternative for financial investments,'' he said.
   The pound fell to $1.8265 from $1.8385. Sterling, which has
surged this month, was knocked back Thursday after major British
banks cut interest rates.
   Other dollar rates in Europe at midmorning, compared with late
Thursday's rates, included: 1.6940 West German marks, up from
1.6775; 1.4020 Swiss francs, up from 1.3940; 5.7490 French francs,
up from 5.7175; 1.8985 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8885; 1,253.25
Italian lire, up from 1,244.37; 1.2490 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2493.
   The dollar came under selling pressure in Tokyo, but closed up
on the day at 128.35 Japanese yen, against 127.43 yen on Thursday.
In later London trading today, the dollar was holding steady at
128.35 yen.
   London's major bullion houses fixed a recommended gold price at
midmorning of $442.80 a troy ounce, down from $443 late Thursday.
   Gold was bid at $442.60 in Zurich, down from $445. Earlier, the
metal closed in Hong Kong at a bid of $446.39, down from $448.75.
   Silver bullion traded in London at a bid of $6.29 a troy ounce,
down from $6.34.

   The U.S. dollar rose in Tokyo trading today and the
stock market continued to rally as dealers reacted favorably to
better-than-expected U.S. trade data.
   After opening the day at 128.65 yen, the dollar slid under
midday selling pressure but finished at 128.35 yen, up 0.92 yen
from Thursday's close. The dollar ranged between a high of 128.72
yen and a low of 128.30 yen during the trading.
   ``The dollar came under selling pressure from exporters and
insurance companies, bringing it down from the morning opening,'' a
foreign exchange dealer said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues finished the day's trading at 25,966.26 points, up
93.97 points, or 0.36 percent, from Thursday's closing figure.
Volume in the first section was 1.2 billion shares.
   Large-capital industrials, steels and electricals fared well
during the day, but construction issues were weak, possibly due to
friction with the United States, according to a dealer who asked
that he not be further identified.
   The Nikkei index has been gaining for the past four days, and
today's closing figure was the highest recorded since stock prices
plunged last October.
   ``The trade figures were better than we had expected, and we're
seeing a strengthening of bullish sentiment'' said a broker with a
major firm who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
   According to figures released by the U.S. Department of Commerce
Thursday, the U.S. trade deficit with Japan for January was $3.95
billion, down from $4.79 billion in December. The total trade
deficit for January was $12.44 billion, up from $12.20 billion the
month before.

<HEAD>Merv Griffin Makes Offer for Resorts International Inc.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROGER GILLOTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wealthy entertainer Merv Griffin, who late
last year entered the hotel business by paying $100 million for the
Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, has offered $35 per share, or $225
million, for Resorts International Inc.
   But an attorney for New York real estate investor Donald Trump,
who controls about 90 percent of Resorts' voting power and is
offering $22 per share to take the company private, spurned the
Thursday offer as ``illusory'' and a ``blatant attempt at market
manipulation.''
   Trump is chairman of Resorts International, which operates
hotel-casinos in New Jersey and the Bahamas.
   Griffin's offer, made by his privately owned Griffin Co.
investment concern, is contingent on several conditions, including
a provision that Trump agree to vote his shres in favor of the
merger and agree to terminate his five-year management agreement
for Resorts' Atlantic City properties.
   Trump has ``no intention of agreeing'' to those conditions, said
his attorney, Jack Nusbaum.
   In light of the stance by Trump, Resorts' board decided at a
Thursday meeting that Griffin's offer was ``moot.'' Therefore, the
board decided not to withdraw its recommendation in favor of
Trump's $22-per-share offer.
   In response, Griffin spokesman Mark Gill said Griffin is
considering legal action against Resorts' outside directors for
breach of fiduciary duty to shareholders other than Trump. Three of
Resorts' six directors are Trump nominees.
   Despite insistence by Trump that he would not raise his offer,
Resorts stock closed Thursday at $25.25 per share, up $3.37{.
   Griffin said it decided to make the offer after talks with F.V.
Scutti, a major holder of Resorts' Class A common stock who is
dissatisfied with Trump's offer. Scutti owns about 5 percent of the
htel-casino company.
   Resorts has 5.7 million Class A shares outstanding, each of
which is entitled to one vote. It also has 752,000 Class B shares,
nearly all of which are owned by Trump and each of which has 100
votes.
   In Atlantic City, N.J., Resorts, which maintains corporate
offices in both Atlantic City and North Miami, Fla., owns the
700-room Resorts Casino Hotel and undeveloped real estate facing
the Boardwalk and is building the 42-floor, 1,250-room Taj Mahal.
   It also operates a casino and owns and operates hotel facilities
with 1,370 rooms on Paradise Island in the Bahamas.
   Work on the luxurious and expensive Taj Mahal, which will be the
largest hotel-casino in New Jersey when it is completed, has been
at the root of financial problems for Resorts.
   Trump bought control of Resorts when its stock was depressed by
those difficulties, and he was granted the five-year operating
agreement of Resorts' Atlantic City properties in exchange for
agreeing to help raise financing to complete the Taj Mahal.
   That financing hasn't yet been arranged, and Trump has offered
$22 per share to buy out other shareholders and take the company
private. Initially, Trump had offered $15 per share, but a number
of Class A shareholders sued and Trump raised his offer to settle
those suits. A court hearing to approve those settlements is
scheduled for Friday in Delaware, where Resorts is based.
   Nusbaum contended the offer by Griffin was arranged by Scutti in
an effort to force Trump to raise his bid again.
   Besides the Beverly Hilton, the Griffin Co. owns several radio
stations and the nation's largest supplier of closed-circuit TV
systems, which are widely used at facilities such as racetracks. It
also has extensive real estate holdings in Beverly Hills and
Northern California.
   Merv Griffin is a 10-time Emmy Award winner who served for 23
years as host of ``The Merv Griffin Show,'' one of TV's
longest-running programs.

   Stock prices gained more ground today, extending
the advance that has carried the market to its highest levels since
Black Monday last fall.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 4.48 to 2,090.52 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 4 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 659 up, 370 down and
475 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 84.14 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Activity was swollen by the quarterly ``triple witching hour''
involving a group of expiring options and futures on stock indexes.
   Settlement of one key futures contract was done as of the
opening today. Reports from the NYSE of preopening order imbalances
were on the buy side.
   The rest of the settlement process was slated to be conducted at
the close.
   Beyond that, analysts said traders were encouraged by Thursday's
news of a smaller-than-expected trade deficit in January, with

   Pillsbury Co.'s stock headed lower today
after a two-day run-up, apparently dampened by a report of a
larger-than-expected quarterly loss and word that the company was
negotiating to sell its Godfather's Pizza chain.
   Rumors that the food and restaurant giant is a takeover target
pushed Pillsbury's stock up more than $7 a share over the course of
two days. On Thursday, Pillsbury closed at $45.37{ in heavy New
York Stock Exchange trading.
   But that trend reversed today, when the stock fell 25 cents a
share to $45.12{.
   Pillsbury said Thursday it lost $107.8 million during the third
fiscal quarter, $50 million more than anticipated and a sharp
downturn from the $48.5 million, or 56-cents-a-share profit posted
in the year-ago period.
   Sales during the quarter fell to $1.5 billion from $1.53 billion
a year earlier.
   William Spoor, Pillsbury chairman and chief executive,
acknowledged in a letter to shareholders, ``given our many recent
disappointments, it is not surprising that we have raised investor
skepticism and questions about our future.''
   But he said he remained committed to keeping the company
independent. ``Now we must demonstrate, through action and not
words, that we can perform at levels commensurate with our
potential,'' he said.
   Spoor said the quarterly loss, which stemmed from $140.9 million
in restructuring charges to close businesses, restaurant properties
and plants, would contribute to an earnings decline in fiscal 1988,
which ends May 31.
   Two-thirds of the charges occurred in the company's restaurant
division.
   The 580-unit Godfather's chain, which Pillsbury acquired in
1985, was put on the block because it did not have near-term
potential to be ``a major strategic component of Pillsbury's
portfolio,'' Spoor stated.
   Company spokesman Johnny Thompson said negotiations were under
way with the management team of Omaha, Neb.-based Godfather's, but
he declined to comment on whether Pillsbury had received any offers.
   Pillsbury earlier announced plans to sell its Bay Street, Key
West Grill and Quik Wok restaurant chains. Spoor said the company
had received a letter of intent from an unidentified party to buy
Bay Street.
   However, Spoor reiterated that Burger King, the company's
biggest restaurant operation, is not for sale.
   Analysts had been expecting Pillsbury to announce a
restructuring _ including the sale of its Steak & Ale, Bennigan's
and Godfather's restaurant operations _ ever since chairman John
Stafford resigned last month and Spoor took over as interim
chairman.
   Pillsbury's announcement in February of lower-than-expected
earnings for the fiscal year ended in May preceded Stafford's Feb.
29 departure.
   Analysts have speculated that potential buyers for Pillsbury
could include Swiss-based Nestle SA, Beatrice Co. of Chicago and
New York investor Saul Steinberg.

   Firestone Tire & Rubber jumped 15| to 78[. The company agreed
Thursday to be acquired by Bridgestone of Japan for $80 a share, in
a deal that topped a previous $58-a-share bid by Pirelli Group of

   The great U.S. airline giveaway seems to be
grinding to a halt.
   Worried about the potential financial impact of burgeoning
frequent-flier programs and triple-mileage travel awards, many
major air carriers have imposed restrictions on the plans or are
thinking of doing so.
   The frequent-flier plans, which reward passengers with free
tickets or upgrades to first class after they have flown a set
number of miles, were launched in 1981 to stimulate ``brand
loyalty'' to airlines in a fiercely competitive climate.
   The giveaway escalated to fever pitch at the beginning of this
year, when Delta Air Lines introduced a new program to
automatically triple the mileage accumulated by frequent fliers.
Most big airlines quickly followed suit.
   But the U.S. airline industry is facing a staggering revenue
loss if the estimated 8 million people enrolled in those programs
start redeeming their bonuses and bumping paying passengers. The
accumulated value of those bonuses is around $1.24 billion, reckons
Julius Maldutis, senior airline analyst for the investment firm
Salomon Brothers Inc.
   That compares with total industry revenue of around $46.7
billion in 1985, $50.5 billion in 1986 and just over $60 billion
last year.
   ``The frequent-flier programs have really gotten out of
control,'' said Dan Sheehy, a spokesman for United Airlines.
``We're concerned with the direction that the programs are taking.''
   John Zeeman, United's executive vice president for marketing and
planning, said in a speech early this month that the airline is
considering imposing restrictions on its frequent-flier programs.
He said the options under review include requiring that travel
awards be redeemed by a certain deadline, and even eliminating free
trips and providing only first-class upgrades instead.
   If United decides to limit its program, the changes would be
announced in early May, Zeeman said.
   Many other airlines have recently slapped restrictions on their
programs _ most notably by limiting the number of free tickets for
any one flight. But the limits being mulled by United, a subsidiary
of Allegis Corp. and the nation's largest airline, are more
far-reaching and could be matched by the other carriers.
   ``The last thing these airlines need is more damage on their
balance sheets,'' said Peter Tanous, an editor of Frequent, a
monthly newsletter on frequent-flier programs published in Colorado
Springs, Colo. ``The airlines are scared stiff that they may be
forced to take a hit against their earnings.''
   Observers warn that the Internal Revenue Service could decide to
tax the programs, sparking a ``mad rush'' by passengers to redeem
their travel bonuses. The IRS indicated recently that it considers
travel awards a form of reportable income when transportation costs
for a frequent business flier are paid by an employer.
   And the Financial Accounting Standards Board is expected to
require airlines to provide for the liability of unredeemed awards
in their 1988 financial statements.
   The looming crisis has taken hold during an already turbulent
period for the nation's airline industry. The business is coming
off one of its worst safety performances in 1987, struggling with
unions and threatened strikes against some big carriers, and
worrying about the possibility of a recession later in the year.
   For now, though, many airlines are enjoying robust passenger
traffic and earnings _ prompting them to raise fares recently and
to eliminate some discount fares.
   Analysts say nearly all the major airlines except Delta have
started to limit their frequent-flier largesse by instituting
``capacity control,'' or reducing the number of freebies on a
flight.
   ``Everyone else is doing it; you have to control and manage your
inventory,'' said Bob Gibbons, a spokesman for Northwest Airlines _
which will start capacity control on April 1 for bonuses issued
after Feb. 15.
   Even holdout Delta has ``blackout'' dates, or certain peak
travel periods when free tickets cannot be used. Delta, the third
largest airline, also has the unique requirement that frequent
fliers must charge their tickets on an American Express card.
   ``We want to remain competitive with the industry,'' Delta
spokesman Jim Lundy said when asked what might happen if United
instituted major restrictions.
   Some airlines also are looking at other approaches, such as
replacing free travel with merchandise awards or hotel and car
rental premiums.
   While they could significantly restrict their frequent-flier
programs, the airlines are not about to eliminate them or
triple-mileage awards altogether, observers say. When the
triple-mileage plans were launched at the start of the year, the
carriers assured passengers that the popular gimmicks would be
retained through 1988.
   ``We recognize that there certainly is an economic impact
associated with the triple-mileage program,'' said Frank DiNuzzo,
managing director of sales promotion for American Airlines. But, he
added, American has no intention of canceling its program.
   Indeed, some observers suggest the airlines may be caught in a
sort of ``Catch-22'' by their frequent-flier programs, forced to
keep them because there is no way to end them.
   ``I suspect that if the airlines had their druthers, they would
throw frequent-flier programs into a bonfire because they've just
become so expensive,'' said Michael J. Friedman, a vice president
of SH&E Inc., an aviation consulting firm.
   However, he noted, it would be extremely difficult for a carrier
to end its frequent-flier program without all its competitors doing
the same.

<HEAD>U.S. Companies Wasting Billions on Business Travel, Study Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Frequent Fliers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While the major U.S. airlines may be losing
millions of dollars with their frequent-flier programs and
triple-mileage travel awards, a new study contends that companies
are wasting as much as $12 billion a year on business travel.
   The survey of 57 large and medium-sized companies by
Travelmation Corp., a travel agency based in Stamford, Conn., found
that U.S. businesses are squandering 10 percent to 15 percent of
their annual travel budgets.
   Travel agents' use of ``antiquated'' airline reservation systems
that can't keep pace with fast-changing fares is the main cause of
the waste, according to the study.
   Airline analysts estimate that U.S. carriers currently make
around 40,000 fare changes a day.
   ``Millions of dollars could be saved by companies each year
without reducing quality, by combining the use of advanced computer
technology with a carefully worked out corporate travel plan,''
said Travelmation President Louis Van Leeuwen, who directed the
survey.
   Conventional travel agencies _ whose methods worked well before
deregulation of the U.S. airline industry in 1978 _ are now unable
to offer companies the best travel values, Van Leeuwen said.
   Among the study's other findings:
   _Conventional travel agencies, even those equipped with
computers, can't keep track of constant fare changes.
   _Many travel agents can't guarantee they will find flights at
the lowest fares available.
   _Many agents don't automatically process the daily-changing
rules governing which fares can be used on which flights.
   _Corporate travel policies are largely ignored by travel agents.

   Wheat futures moved a little higher early today
on the Chicago Board of Trade, but soybeans and most corn contracts
were on the decline.
   A large speculator who triggered a sharp rally in soybeans on
Thursday was not in the market early today, said Victor Lespinasse,
a trader with the investment firm Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   As a result, he said, a lot of traders who rode Thursday's
momentum with buy orders, were selling off ahead of the weekend.
   The wheat pit remained optimistic amid rumors that the
Agriculture Department is about to make a move on a subsidized
grain deal with a foreign country, possible China, India or the
Soviet Union.
   On the opening, wheat was } cent to 1{ cents higher with the

<HEAD>Oil Pumping Across Isthmus Resumes, Pipeline Operator Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Trans-Panama pipeline that
carries Alaska oil across the isthmus en route to markets on the
U.S. Gulf Coast resumed operations Friday, the pipeline said.
   Pumping had stopped because a strike by electrical workers cut
off power Wednesday and Thursday, prompting the Panamanian
government to announce it was taking over all public utilities.
   ``Service was restored at 6 a.m. (EST) this morning,'' a
spokesman for the pipeline operator said. ``We actually never
stopped loading and unloading at both ends. We stopped the actual
pumping from one end to the other because for that we depend on
public energy. But we have our own plant at each end for loading
and unloading.''
   The pipeline carries 650,000 barrels a day of Alaska oil,
roughly 10 percent of U.S. domestic production. A barrel is
equivalent to 42 gallons.
   BP America Inc. owns two-thirds to three-quarters of the oil
flowing through the pipeline. The rest is owned by Exxon Co. USA.
   The flow was first halted at 2 p.m. EST Wednesday when
electrical workers joined a widespread strike against Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, said Tim Reynolds, a BP America spokesman in
Washington, D.C. The strike cut off power to a pump station at the
foot of a mountain, he said.
   The company was taking steps to set up a ship-to-ship transfer
operation in order to put at least some of its oil through the
canal, but service was restored, making thaat action unnecessary.
   Alaska officials were worried about a Panama pipeline shutdown
because it could slow sales of Alaska crude, which account for the
bulk of state revenues.
   West Coast oil markets are glutted with Alaska oil, and the
federal export ban prevents its sale overseas.
   Chuck Logsdon, chief oil revenue analyst for the state, said the
Gulf Coast markets have been handling more than 600,000 barrels of
the total daily Alaska production of 1.8 million to 1.9 million
barrels.

   A bipartisan presidential commission today
told President Reagan the government should begin a gradual but
wholesale transfer of mail delivery, air traffic control, prison
operations and scores of other services to the private sector.
   Controversial even before its submission, the report by the
Presidential Commission on Privatization goes far beyond earlier
proposals by Reagan to sell off federal assets and reduce the scope
of government.
   ``The government with its checks and balances does not lend
itself to managing high technology,'' said the commission's
chairman, David Linowes, a Democrat. ``Government entities have
injected themselves well beyond the realm of government into
business to the detriment of both business and government.''
   Linowes, a political economics professor at the University of
Illinois, said at press conference after meeting privately with
Reagan that the president ``hasn't had an opportunity to read the
report yet'' and did not indicate what, if any, of the suggestions
the White House would push.
   But he acknowledged that none of the recommendations is likely
to be enacted before Reagan leaves office next January.
   ``This is the first time there has been an independent
exhaustive analysis of the issues,'' Linowes said. ``We didn't take
on this job with the expectation that it would stay with just one
administration.''
   The commission, named last September by the president to expand
upon his own privatization themes, came up with 78 suggestions that
it said would make government more efficient.
   Among the recommendations:
   _The Postal Service's monopoly on delivering letters should be
ended over time, with private companies allowed to compete for the
business.
   _A system of educational ``vouchers'' should be established to
give parents greater freedom of choice in selecting elementary or
secondary schools for their children. Linowes suggested vouchers of
about $3,000 a year and said they might be redeemable at private
schools as well, although at a discount.
   _The government should expand its voucher system for low-cost
public housing instead of building new projects, while selling
existing public housing to residents where possible.
   _The management of military commissaries and federal, state and
local prisons should be contracted out.
   _Airport control towers should be privately run, although the
government should ``continue to regulate the national airspace.''
   The report also called for privatization of elements of Medicare
and sale of the government's $250 billion loan portfolio, and it
echoed Reagan's own calls to sell off naval petroleum reserves,
urban mass transit systems and Amtrak rail passenger service.
   ``He seems to be gung-ho on it,'' Linowes said in an interview.
``There were bound to be some overlaps.''
   Many of these items, proposed in annual Reagan budget
recommendations, already have been rejected by a Congress that to
date has demonstrated little enthusiasm for ``privatization.''
   But Linowes said he believes the concept will be more warmly
received on Capitol Hill as the work product of a bipartisan
commission.
   ``The facts will argue for themselves,'' Linowes said. He called
the panel's work an ``exhaustive analysis.''
   Among the panel's 12 members are James McIntyre Jr., who was
budget director for President Carter, and Melvin R. Laird,
secretary of defense under President Nixon.
   Linowes, a professor of political economy, said that the panel
is proposing a gradual turnover of government functions to private
business. ``In no place do we suggest it happen overnight, that
today you're a government agency and tomorrow, you're not.''
   However, the recommendations generated sharp advance opposition
from public employees' and postal workers' unions.
   The National Association of Letter Carriers said ending the
present Postal Service monopoly on first- and third-class mail
delivery would destroy the nation's system of universal service.
``Rural and inner-city residents would not be served ... or would
receive reduced service at exorbitant postal rates,'' the union
said.
   Linowes, however, claimed the government could still demand
postal delivery to all areas at the same price, even if performed
by private companies.
   ``Permeating all these recommendations is that the government
must never abdicate its responsibility for establishing policy and
standards,'' he said.
   On the proposal to contract out prison administration, Linowes
said the government might pay a fee for each prisoner processed.
   ``I can also see incentives given,'' he added, suggesting it
might be a good way to whittle away at the nation's 80 percent
repeat-offender rate.
   ``You could give a bonus if the released prisoner wasn't
returned to jail for two years, a bigger bonus if he stayed out for
five. Less than two years, no bonus. There would be an incentive
that doesn't exist now. I can visualize teams of behavioral
scientists and sociologists being hired as well as guards.''
   Linowes said the report throws down a challenge for innovative
thinking.
   ``For instance, there may be a question of whether Amtrak can
ever be made profitable under present circumstances. But why can't
the air space over railroad stations be leased out for 20- or
30-story office towers?
   ``Why should ticket agents stand around all day waiting to sell
railroad tickets? Why can't they sell something else as well _
postcards or stamps? We could bring in creative people from the
private sector. They could have circus cars running between New
York and Washington and charge $5 a head. Or we could have
historical trips.''

<TEXT>
   Running a retailing company has become a
defensive business these days.
   Time was, all management had to worry about was getting people
in the front door. Now, they have to fend off corporate raiders at
the back door.
   With takeover activity threatening their independence, some
companies have taken steps to protect themselves. But others still
cling to the myth that it can't happen here.
   Two weeks ago, Dart Group Corp. dropped its bid for Stop & Shop
Cos. after Stop & Shop agreed to a leveraged buyout by Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts Inc. Analysts expect Dart, with a string of
unsuccessful takeover attempts behind it, to try for another
retailer.
   And if Campeau Corp. loses to R.H. Macy & Co. Inc. in their
battle over Federated Department Stores Inc., the Toronto-based
developer will probably pursue another major department store
operator such as May Department Stores Co. or Dayton Hudson Corp.
   Which retailers are the most likely targets?
   The most vulnerable are companies whose stock is widely held,
rather than concentrated in the hands of a few insiders, said
Monroe H. Greenstein, a retail industry analyst with the investment
firm Bear Stearns & Co. Inc.

<HEAD>Ford Scraps Planned Factory After Unions Squabble</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A squabble among British unions over single-union
representation at factories led Ford Motor Co. to cancel plans
Friday for an electronics plant in Scotland.
   Ford said the proposed $73 million plant could not compete if
its workers were represented by more than one union.
   Conservative Party politicians reacted quickly, accusing the
unions of causing job losses in an economically depressed area.
   ``The Dundee fiasco is a tragic return to the socialist anarchy
of the 1970s,'' said Michael Heseltine, a Conservative lawmaker in
Parliament.
   Malcolm Rifkind, the government's Scottish secretary, criticized
the unions for holding ``neanderthal attitudes.''
   Ford said that it had reached agreement with the Amalgamated
Engineering Union to represent the initial work force of 450
employees, but that the 11 other unions also representing workers
at Ford's current British plants balked. Plans called for the
Scottish factory to employ about 1,000 workers at peak production.
   Britain's unions are deeply divided about whether to accept
single-union deals and no-strike agreements, which have become more
common in this country, particularly at Japanese-owned plants.
   Union leaders have also been struggling to find a way to regain
the power they lost under the legislation enacted by Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government.
   Years of relative labor calm have been disrupted by recent
strikes at Ford and other auto plants, as well as walkouts by
miners and nurses.
   Ford said there was ``no prospect'' of reaching an agreement for
a single union to represent the plant's hourly workers.
   ``After very careful consideration, we have decided not to
proceed with development of a new electronics plant in Scotland,''
Frank Macher, general manager of Ford's electrical and electronics
division in Detroit, said in a statement.
   A single trade union agreement was necessary to make the plant
``competitive in its industry in cost and quality,'' Macher said.
``We had not expected that this requirement ... would prove so
difficult to achieve.''
   Norman Willis, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress,
said he was calling two urgent meetings on Monday to discuss the
Ford decision and to try to reverse it.
   The 12 Ford unions would meet the same day, he said.
   Gavin Laird, leader of the Amalgamated Engineering Union which
represents about two-thirds of Ford's more than 32,000 hourly
workers, said he was pressing Ford's senior management for a
top-level meeting at its Detroit headquarters early next week to
try to save the plant.
   However, a Ford spokesman in Detroit, John Emmert, said later in
a telephone interview with Independent Television News: ``There is
no chance that the decision will be changed.''
   The deal's opponents feared workers at the Dundee plant would
earn lower wages than workers at Ford's 21 other British plants.

<HEAD>Connecticut Challenges AT&T Surcharge on Telephone Bills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENT LAYMON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State officials moved Friday to recover
$40 million they say American Telephone & Telegraph Co. has added
unfairly to the telephone bills of Connecticut customers during the
last two years.
   In a complaint filed with the Federal Communications Commission,
the officials challenged the telephone company's right to add a 7.3
percent surcharge on long-distance charges to recoup the
gross-receipts tax it pays in Connecticut.
   They argued that the surcharge imposed in Connecticut and nine
other states violates the longstanding practice of having uniform
telephone rates across the country.
   The other states where the surcharge is imposed are: Florida,
Maine, Maryland, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, West
Virginia and Wisconsin, according to the complaint filed with the
FCC.
   ``Since the early days of the telephone company, this country
was built upon having an average rate throughout the country,''
Consumer Counsel James F. Meehan said in announcing the action.
   ``The thought was that people in Montana should be able to call
people in Hartford at the same rate that people in Hartford ...
call people in Montana,'' he said.
   Meehan and Attorney General Joseph I. Lieberman have formed an
alliance with the state Department of Public Utility Control in
challenging federal regulators for allowing AT&T to impose the
surcharge.
   The complaint seeks to recover the $40 million collected by AT&T
so far and to eliminate the surcharge.
   The FCC allowed AT&T to add the surcharge in states with a
gross-receipts tax on long-distance companies starting in April
1986. The surcharge in Connectict was initially 3.6 percent, but
rose to 7.3 percent in January.
   AT&T is the only long-distance carrier regulated by the FCC,
although other long-distance companies such as Sprint and MCI also
add the surcharge to their bills, Meehan said.
   AT&T officials responded that figuring the gross receipts tax
into its national rates would be unfair to customers elsewhere in
the country.
   ``Only Connecticut residents benefit from the state gross
receipts tax on telecommunications companies, and therefore
Connecticut customers should pay those extra costs of doing
business,'' said Paul Karoff, an AT&T spokesman in Connecticut.
   Meehan said AT&T came up with the idea of imposing the surcharge
in the 10 states with a gross receipts tax in order to generate
millions of dollars that would allow it to reduce rates.
   Connecticut officials contend it is unfair given that the actual
cost providing telephone service is lower in here than in many
other parts of the country because of the high volume of business.
Connecticut is the 10th-largest telecommunications market in the
United States and generates about $550 million in annual revenues
for AT&T, Meehan said.
   Also, AT&T doesn't add surcharges to recover other types of
taxes it pays, they said.
   The officials acknowledged it may be difficult to convince the
FCC to hold a hearing on the complaint, particularly since the FCC
previously approved the surcharge. They vowed to take the case to
court if the FCC refuses to hear it.
   ``There are fundamental issues of how rates are set in the
country,'' Meehan said. ``If we are successful, I think create some
new case law that will have major impact on rate setting practices
throughout the federal system.''

<HEAD>Pizza Company Delivers Annual Report In Appropriate Box</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Domino's Pizza Inc. advertises
``Domino's delivers,'' and the company delivered its annual report
this year in an unmistakably shaped 12\-inch-by-12\-inch flip-open
box.
   ``That would be a small medium,'' said Ron Hingst, one of those
involved in what has become a tradition of non-traditional annual
reports.
   The 1986 version was in the form of a spiral school-style
notebook with tabbed dividers for different subjects. An earlier
report came with a set of dominos.
   ``It's a chance for the financial guys to play marketing,''
Hingst said.
   This year's pizza-style box contained a cardboard jigsaw puzzle
of the Domino's Pizza name and trademark, and the report, with a
quotation from Thomas S. Monaghan, chairman and founder, on the
cover: ``1987 was the year we worked hard to pull all the pieces
together.''
   Along with sections on areas such as development and service,
the report gave financial results reported earlier: net income of
$7.7 million on total revenue of $883.7 million for 1987, up from
$7.1 million on revenue of $721.6 million for 1986.
   Because Domino's is privately-held, its annual report goes to
suppliers, media contacts, and other people and companies it deals
with, Hingst said.

   Stock prices kept climbing today, extending the
advance that has carried the market to its highest levels since
Black Monday last fall.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.79 to 2,094.83 by
2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 5 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 847 up, 586 down and
481 unchanged.
   Activity was swollen by the quarterly ``triple witching hour''
involving a group of expiring options and futures on stock indexes
that are used in large-scale computer program trading.
   Settlement of one key futures contract was done based on stock
prices as of the opening today. Reports from the NYSE of preopening
order imbalances were on the buy side.
   The rest of the settlement process was slated to be conducted at
the close.
   Beyond that, analysts said the market was still benefiting from
Thursday's news of a smaller-than-expected trade deficit in
January, with imports exceeding exports by $12.44 billion.
   Firestone Tire & Rubber led the active list and jumped 15{ to
78. The company agreed Thursday to be acquired by Bridgestone of
Japan for $80 a share, in a deal that topped a previous $58-a-share
bid by Pirelli Group of Italy.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Ford Motor, up \ at 44~;
Exxon, up ] at 44], and Merck, up 2 at 160}. However, General
Electric dropped { to 44[ and International Business Machines was
down ] at 114{.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.55 to 153.23. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .97 at 299.96.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 180.65 million shares with two

<HEAD>Nestle Acquires Buitoni Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nestle S.A., the giant Swiss multinational
food group, Friday said it agreed to acquire the commercial and
industrial holdings of Italy's Buitoni food group for 1.6 trillion
lire, or $1.2 billion.
   Nestle said it was buying Buitoni's operations from Cie.
Industriali Riunite SpA (CIR), a key holding of Italian financier
Carlo De Benedetti.
   Under the specifics of the transaction, CIR will sell all the
operating units of Buitoni SpA, its chocolate and confectionary
company Perugina SpA, and Buitoni S.A., the French holding which
controls Buitoni's foreign operations.
   The acquisition represents the end of De Benedetti's dream of
creating a major European food conglomerate, which was frustrated
by his failure to gain control of Societe Meridionale Finanzaria
SpA (SME), Italy's major state-run food group.
   The sale also raises a considerable sum of cash to help De
Benedetti in his fight to gain control of Societe Generale de
Belgique, Belgium's biggest company.
   CIR acquired control of Buitoni in 1985 with an initial
investment of 25 billion lire, $20 million at today's exchange
rates, which was subsequently increased to 160 billion lire.
   Given the size of the initial investment, analysts said De
Benedetti had achieved a remarkable return on his original
investment.
   ``It looks as if the engineer (De Benedetti) has pulled out of
the food industry in style. The problem was that Buitoni didn't
reach sufficient critical mass,'' said Giovanni Raimondi, an
analyst with Milan brokerage Studio Aletti.
   In 1987, the Buitoni group earned consolidated net income before
payments to minority interests of $40.8 million, up from a loss of
$37.6 million in 1984.
   Buitoni produces pasta, crackers and sauces in Italy, France and
Britain. The Perugia-based Buitoni group also includes Perugina,
one of Italy's leading chocolate producers as well as Davigel S.A.
of France, which produces frozen food and food services, Olio Sasso
SpA, an edible oils group and Vismara SpA, a meat producer.
   The Buitoni group, which employs some 8,000 people, earned 39
percent of its revenue in Italy in 1987, 36 percent in France, 16
percent in Britain, 4 percent in the rest of Europe and 5 percent
in the rest of the world.
   Nestle said it was particularly interested in the acquisiton of
Buitoni because it would give it a niche in the market for
typically Italian foods, such as pasta. It also will mesh Perugina
with its own chocolate sector.

<HEAD>Bridgestone To Buy Firestone for $2.6 Billion</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Grafs 1-10 new with Pirelli saying it will wait before making

<TEXT>
   Japan's Bridgestone Corp. agreed to buy Firestone
Tire & Rubber Co. for nearly $2.6 billion in cash, an offer that
leaped far beyond a rival bid for Firestone from the Italian
tiremaker Pirelli SpA.
   Pirelli, which offered $1.93 billion for Firestone, said today
from its headquarters in Milan, Italy, that it would not increase
its offer. Later, in a statement issued in New York, the company
said it would wait before making a final decision on dropping its
current offer.
   Firestone directors announced the agreement to Bridgestone's
$80-a-share offer late Thursday, and recommended that shareholders
reject the Pirelli bid.
   Firestone stock, which had closed at $62.50 a share on Thursday,
shot up to $78 by midafternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Bridgestone and Firestone had announced an agreement in
mid-February that called for the Japanese company to buy 75 percent
of Firestone's worldwide tire manufacturing business for $1.5
billion.
   But after Pirelli launched its bid last week, Bridgestone, faced
with losing the world's fourth largest tire manufacturer, decided
to bid for the entire company.
   ``We never considered backing away from our agreement with
Firestone to become its partner in operating its worldwide tire
businesses,'' Bridgestone President Akira Yeiri said. ``The merger
agreement merely represents an expansion and extension of our
original agreement.''
   In its statement in Milan, Pirelli said it would not raise its
bid.
   ``Pirelli has always said that its offer would be limited by its
evaluation of industrial logic,'' the statement said. ``The figure
offered by Bridgestone does not fit into such logic.''
   But Pirelli added in the later statement that it would wait
until Bridgestone formally began its tender offer for Firestone
before deciding whether to terminate its own offer.
   Yeiri said his company planned to keep Firestone's worldwide
tire operations headquarters in Akron, Ohio, under existing
management. All of Firestone's North American plants will stay in
operation.
   Firestone Chairman John J. Nevin said a Bridgestone subsidiary
would begin a cash tender offer within the next few days for all of
Firestone's 32 million outstanding shares. The offer is subject to
at least two-thirds of the shares being tendered and approval of
the deal by Firestone shareholders.
   Bridgestone also has an option to acquire up to 5.8 million
shares held by Firestone's treasury, a ``lock-up'' option typically
granted to discourage hostile suitors.
   Firestone ranks fourth in tire sales worldwide, behind industry
leader Goodyear, Michelin and Bridgestone, according to industry
estimates.
   In the fiscal year ending October 1987, Firestone had net income
of $1.45 million, or $3.96 a share, on sales of $3.87 billion.
   Firestone's agreement with Bridgestone was a major blow to
Pirelli, which wants a foothold in the U.S. tire market, the
world's largest. Pirelli has a nominal 1.5 percent share of the
U.S. market.
   Sources close to Pirelli said Pirelli will continue to seek new
markets.
   ``There are always new opportunities in the U.S.,'' said one
source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   With the failure of its bid, Pirelli is canceling an agreement
with France's Michelin group. Pirelli had agreed to sell
Firestone's retails stores division, its Brazilian operations and
some other assets to Michelin for as much as $800 million if its
bid succeeded.
   ``That agreement (with Michelin) was contingent on us acquiring
Firestone, so that goes up in the air,'' a Pirelli spokesman said.

<HEAD>Fruit Grower Develops Packaging to Prevent Bruising</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOWELL, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There's nothing Roger Kropf likes less than
a bruised apple.
   For years the Lowell fruit grower has looked for a way to
package the perfect fruit _ and to keep it that way during the long
haul to the supermarket and, eventually, the consumer's kitchen.
   ``But no matter how we handle the product here, it can be
damaged any time, starting at the point the trucks are unloaded at
the store up until the consumer puts it in the refrigerator,'' said
Kropf, president of Kropf Fruit Co.
   Kropf's company grows and markets its own apples, peaches and
plums and markets fruit for about 100 other growers across Michigan.
   Kropf wrestled with a variety of ideas on how to protect produce
from damage in shipment, but it took a trip to an egg-carton
company to get the answer.
   ``I was standing in the production area of a company which makes
polyfoam products and watching them make egg cartons,'' Kropf said.
``I thought, `Good Lord, if they can protect eggs, they ought to be
able to protect apples.'''
   Kropf began exploring the idea last year with DOLCO of Decatur,
Ill. After a lengthy testing period, the two companies produced a
deep-blue, polyfoam container with wings to distribute the weight
of stacked packages without damaging the fruit.
   Kropf's company began marketing fruit in the new containers in
January.
   Much like the egg carton, Kropf's new container is a 12-pack.
The container and contents are covered with a clear, plastic film
providing a view of the fruit.
   The fruit is shipped in the specially designed packages and kept
in them while on retailers' shelves. A 3-pound package of apples
averages about 25 cents more than the 3-pound, plastic bag of
apples now found in supermarket produce departments.
   ``This is really geared for only about 10 percent of the market,
for the clientele willing to pay a bit more for quality fruit,''
said Steve Krampe, sales manager for the company.
   Kropf ships his fruit throughout the United States east of the
Rockies and exports to foreign countries.
   But the company isn't stopping at shipping the perfect apple. It
also plans to develop the special packaging for shipping peaches.
   ``We're very excited about the possibilities with peaches,''
said Krampe. ``They bruise even more easily than apples.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The public may be able to buy shares this spring
in Sotheby's Holdings Inc., the world's richest art auction house
said Friday.
   A statement from the U.S.-owned private company said the share
flotation will be in London and New York.
   The flotation was originally planned for last fall but was
postponed when stock markets crashed in October.
   ``Since the stock market downturn ... the international art
market has remained strong, with record prices continuing to be set
in many collecting areas,'' the statement said.
   The announcement followed swiftly on a report in London's
Evening Standard newspaper that the flotation is planned for late
April and values the firm at ``slightly less than 300 million
pounds,'' or $546 million.
   That was 100 million pounds, or $182 million, less than the
pre-crash valuation, the report added.
   Alfred Taubman, the Michigan shopping mall tycoon, gained
control of Sotheby's in September 1983 at a cost of 83 million
pounds, or $124.5 million at the time.
   Sotheby's said a spring flotation would depend on ``favorable
stock market conditions'' and no definite sale date was set.
   The Evening Standard said a complex share-voting structure is
planned which would leave control with Taubman.
   Sotheby's is being advised on the flotation by the Wall Street
house of Salomon Brothers and British merchant bank Lazard Brothers
and Co. Ltd.

<HEAD>Irradiation Company Founder Accused Of Safety Violations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The founder and ex-president of an
irradiation company and a leading spokesman for the food
preservation process was indicted Friday on charges he ordered
workers to bypass safety precautions and lied about it to federal
regulators.
   The company, Radiation Technology Inc. of Morris Plains,
Wednesday pleaded guilty to related charges involving violations at
its Rockaway plant. RTI irradiates medical products and spices.
   Company founder Martin Welt had planned to plead guilty to
unspecified charges in the case the same day but withdrew from a
plea agreement at the last moment, said prosecutors in the U.S.
attorney's Newark office.
   Welt, 55, of Denville, withdrew as RTI's president in mid-1986
after the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission temporarily
suspended the company's license for the safety violations.
   He has been one of the process's most vocal supporters, touting
it in the media and making a promotional trip to China last year.
Welt also was a physicist with the NRC's predecessor, the Atomic
Energy Commission.
   Also named in the 11-count indictment was William Jouris, 48, of
Littleton, Mass. In 1985, Jouris was a resident nuclear engineer
and operations manager at the Rockaway plant, the indictment said.
   Welt and Jouris were charged with conspiracy to defraud the NRC,
making false statements and violating the Atomic Energy Act. Welt
also was charged with obstruction of justice.
   Welt's attorney, Theodore H. Wells, said he had not seen the
indictment and could not comment. He also refused to comment on the
apparent breakdown in plea negotiations. Welt did not return a
message left on his answering machine.
   Jouris could not be reached for comment. He did not return a
message left on his home answering machine. Attorney Robert
Fettweis, who prosecutors said has represented Jouris, did not
return a message left at his office.
   The indictment said the defendants bypassed or told others to
bypass ``conveyor door safety interlocks'' at the Rockaway plant.
The devices automatically lower the radiation source, in this case
Cobalt 60, into a protective pool when a human or an object other
than the product to be irradiated enters the area.
   Welt ordered the locks routinely bypassed starting in April
1984, the indictment said, and sought to impede an NRC
investigation into the matter.
   The criminal investigation grew out of the NRC probe, which led
to a pair of temporary license suspensions in 1986.
   Welt called a meeting and threatened RTI workers with dismissal
if they didn't lie to investigators, the indictment said.
   Jouris was accused of removing a radiation safety monitor that
prevented workers from being inadvertently exposed to radiation.
   The company has said no worker or member of the public was
harmed because of the violations.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jacqueline C. Wolff said authorities
know of at least one worker who entered the cell area while
products were being irradiated, but said the worker suffered no
immediate injury.
   She said it was difficult to measure the health affects of the
safety violations because the results of low-level dosages don't
appear until years later.
   She said the safety interlocks frequently malfunctioned,
preventing the irradiation process from going on, so company
officials bypassed them to keep operating.
   The indictment said Jouris and Welt lied to the NRC about the
installation of a new conveyor door safety system at the Rockaway
plant, telling regulators during a routine inspection that it had
tested a new system in tandem with the old system for two weeks
before dismantling the old one.
   Instead, the indictment charged, the old system was taken apart
and the new one installed without testing.
   Welt faces up to 37 years in prison if convicted and Jouris
faces 22 years.
   RTI also has operations in Salem, N.J., West Memphis, Ark., and
Haw River, N.C.

   Stock prices turned downward today, running into
some resistance at their highest levels since Black Monday last
fall.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 10 points
in early trading, was down 5.64 at 2,080.40 by 3 p.m. on Wall
Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 661 up, 806 down and
479 unchanged.
   Activity was swollen by the quarterly ``triple witching hour''
involving a group of expiring options and futures on stock indexes
that are used in large-scale computer program trading.
   Settlement of one key futures contract was done based on stock
prices as of the opening today. Reports from the NYSE of preopening
order imbalances were on the buy side.
   The rest of the settlement process was slated to be conducted at
the close.
   Beyond that, analysts said the market drew some added benefit
from Thursday's news of a smaller-than-expected trade deficit in
January, with imports exceeding exports by $12.44 billion.
   But as the session passed prices fell back as traders moved to
cash in on the market's recent gains.
   Firestone Tire & Rubber led the active list and jumped 15[ to
77|. The company agreed Thursday to be acquired by Bridgestone of
Japan for $80 a share, in a deal that topped a previous $58-a-share
bid by Pirelli Group of Italy.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.35 to 152.33. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .50 at 299.49.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 205.94 million shares with an
hour to go.

   Wheat futures prices advanced while soybeans and
corn skidded lower Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   ``Wheat was about the only market that showed any strength,''
said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Soybeans dropped about a nickel a bushel despite heavy buying
again Friday by a large speculator who triggered a strong rally on
Thursday.
   Friday's buying by the C & D Commodities was accompanied by
heavy selling of soybean options, negating any strong response by
other traders, said Lespinasse.
   He said beans were under pressure from selling by South American
interests and by traders unloading contracts before the weekend.
   Increased farmer selling overnight weakened the corn market.
   A rumor that the Agriculture Department was about to make an
announcement of a large offer of subsidized wheat helped that
grain, said Lespinasse.
   On the close, wheat was 1 cent to 3{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $2.99{ a bushel; corn was { cent
to 1\ cents lower with March at $1.97} a bushel; oats were \ cent

   A top officer at Lotus Development Corp.
has resigned from the computer software company over management
disagreements with the firm's chairman and other senior executives,
the company said Friday.
   Charles J. Digate, 34, a senior vice president in charge of the
company's Analytic Software Group, resigned Thursday ``under mutual
agreement,'' a company statement said.
   But company sources quoted in several published reports said
Digate's resignation was urged by Lotus Chairman Jim P. Manzi, 36,
because his brusk style upset other top executives.
   Digate, who joined Lotus in 1983 from the European Products
Division at Texas Instruments, played a key role in development of
new software products, including the best-selling Lotus 1-2-3
programs. He also helped expand the company's growth in European
and Japanese markets.
   He was assigned nine months ago to the the Analytical Software
Group, which includes the 1-2-3 programs.
   Digate's abrupt resignation raised questions that problems may
exist with the scheduled June introduction of Lotus 1-2-3 Release
3, an upgraded version of the company's spreadsheet package, but a
company statement said there are no changes in the schedule for the
program.
   Lotus is expected to replace Digate with someone from outside
the company.

<TEXT>
   Bridgestone Corp. of Japan plans to create
the most-technologically advanced tire company in the world when it
purchases Firestone Tire & Rubber Co., Bridgestone President Akira
Yeiri said Friday.
   Firestone's board of directors recommended Thursday that
shareholders accept Bridgestone's offer to purchase Firestone's 32
million outstanding shares for $80 a share. Bridgestone was spurred
to make the $2.6 billion offer Thursday because of an unsolicited
offer from Italian tiremaker Pirelli SpA.
   Pirelli did not make a counter offer Friday. The Italian firm
said in a news release that it will await the merger of Bridgestone
and Firestone before making a final decision on terminating its
$58-a-share offer.
   Firestone shareholders meet in Akron on Tuesday.
   Yeiri said Bridgestone, which employs 32,500 people worldwide,
wants to become a global tiremaker with the most efficient
production facilities and the most effective marketing organization
in the world.
   ``The Bridgestone-Firestone alliance brings together many
complimentary strengths,'' Yeiri told a news conference at
Firestone's North American tire headquarters in Akron. ``Together
we have the design and manufacturing capability necessary to build
high-quality tires and to improve our global competitive position.''
   Bridgestone plans to keep Firestone's corporate offices in
Chicago and its North American tire headquarters in Akron, he said.
All of Firestone's North American plants will remain in operation,
he said.
   In the meantime, Bridgestone still plans to move its North
American sales operation from Los Angeles to Nashville, Tenn.
Bridgestone purchased a plant outside Nashville from Firestone in
1983.
   Firestone employs 55,000 people worldwide, including 1,650 in
the Akron area. The company has streamlined itself to the number of
employees needed to operate effectively, Yeiri said. No changes are
planned in Firestone management, he said.
   The two operations complement one another, Yeiri said. Firestone
has production plants in the United States, Canada, Europe and
Latin America, he said, while Bridgestone has a strong sales
network in Asia and Australia.
   Yeiri also noted that Firestone provides original equipment to
Ford and General Motors and has made considerable progress in the
international market with Porche, Volvo, Audi and Volkswagon.
Original equipment is Bridgestone's weakest area, he said.
   Although financing for the purchase hasn't been worked out,
Yeiri said he thinks 50 percent of the purchase price will come
from Bridgestone assets, and Bridgestone will borrow the rest. The
Japanese tire maker decided $80 a share would be a fair offer after
consulting with investment bankers, he said.
   In mid-February, Firestone announced an agreement to sell 75
percent of its worldwide tire manufacturing business to Bridgestone
for $1.5 billion. But that agreement was in jeopardy after Pirelli
launched its tender offer for the entire company last week.
   Akron officials were pleased about Bridgestone's plans to keep
Firestone's Akron operations intact.
   ``The commitment to say we're going to do everything we can to
keep the operations in place with everyone working where they are _
it's good news for Akron,'' said Mayor Don Plusquellic.

   Steel imports rose from December to January
and were sharply higher than in January 1987, the American Iron and
Steel Institute said Thursday.
   The additional tonnage came almost entirely from developing
nations not covered by the Reagan administration's voluntary import
quotas, the Washington-based producers' group said.
   The January imports, as reported to AISI by the Commerce
Department, were 1.81 million tons, up 7 percent from 1.69 million
tons in December and up 24 percent from 1.46 million tons in
January 1987.
   Preliminary figures suggest foreign metal captured 22 percent of
the domestic market, up from 20 percent in January and higher than
the 20 percent target set for the quota plan.

   Pillsbury Co.'s report of a
larger-than-expected quarterly loss ended a two-day run-up in its
stock price that was spurred by takeover speculation, but analysts
said Friday that the company remained vulnerable.
   ``I don't think anything has really changed,'' said Craig Carver
of Dain Bosworth Inc. in Minneapolis. ``I think this company is
still a very strong takeover possibility even though the stock has
traded down somewhat today.''
   In active trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Pillsbury
closed down $2.50 to $42.87{.
   Speculation that the Minneapolis food and restaurant giant was a
takeover target had pushed the company's stock up more than $7 a
share from Wednesday to Thursday.
   But that trend reversed Friday. Pillsbury announced Thursday it
lost $107.8 million during its third fiscal quarter, $50 million
more than anticipated and a sharp downturn from the $48.5 million,
or 56-cents-a-share profit posted in the year-ago period.
   Sales during the quarter fell to $1.5 billion from $1.53 billion
a year earlier.
   William Spoor, Pillsbury chairman and chief executive, said the
quarterly loss stemmed from $140.9 million in restructuring charges
to close businesses, restaurant properties and plants. He said he
expected earnings to decline in fiscal 1988, which ends May 31.
   Pillsbury said it would continue streamlining its troubled
restaurant and food groups and was negotiating to sell its
Godfather's Pizza chain. The company said it would rally around its
core businesses, such as Burger King and Haagen-Dazs ice cream.
   The moves, however, failed to impress analysts.
   ``Godfather's is a drop in the bucket in this whole company,''
Carver said. ``I would think regardless of what they do short of
going out and making a major acquisition in an attempt to make
themselves unattractive is not going to deter a possible raider or
for that matter a friendly buyout attempt.''
   ``The sale of Godfather's is unlikely to generate cash proceeds
exceeding $50 million. To me, investors want more,'' added John M.
McMillin of Prudential-Bache Securities in New York. ``I think
people want more restructuring.''
   The 580-unit Godfather's chain, acquired by Pillsbury in 1985,
is being sold because it does not have ``near-term'' potential to
be a ``major strategic component of Pillsbury's portfolio,'' Spoor
said.
   Pillsbury, which employs about 104,000 worldwide with 97,200
workers in the United States, had no comment Friday on whether it
had received any takeover offers.
   Analysts have speculated that potential buyers for Pillsbury
included Swiss-based Nestle S.A., Beatrice Co. of Chicago and New
York investor Saul Steinberg.
   In a letter to shareholders Thursday, Spoor said he was
committed to keeping Pillsbury independent.

   The dollar turned mixed in domestic dealings
Friday after rising overseas, as uneasiness set in over the
upcoming close of Japan's fiscal year and the long-term prospects
for the U.S. economy.
   Gold prices were mostly higher. Republic National Bank of New
York said gold was bid at $444 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, up
from $443.40 an ounce late Thursday.
   Analysts said the dollar had a slightly firmer tone and
continued to draw support from better-than-expected trade figures
released Thursday.
   ``But there's fear that we'll see trade numbers in the future
that are not that good,'' said Earl I. Johnson, a vice president at
Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
   ``There's still a lot of uncertainty about the economy,'' he
said.
   Analysts said there also is concern about what effect the end of
Japan's fiscal year will have on the U.S. currency.
   Some speculate that Japanese dealers will keep the dollar steady
through the year's March 31 close so they will not have to write
down losses on their portfolios. ``But there's a fear they might
dump dollars'' after that, Johnson said.
   In addition, ``there is a growing fear that because the Japanese
economy is so strong, the Bank of Japan might tighten monetary
policy,'' thereby hiking interest rates, said James O'Neill, vice
president and financial markets economist at Marine Midland Bank.
   Under that scenario, the dollar would fall as Japanese-U.S.
interest rate differentials narrowed, he said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 128.35 Japanese yen, up from
127.43 yen Thursday. In later London trading, the dollar was
holding steady at 128.35 yen. In New York, the dollar fell to
128.00 yen from 128.75 yen on Thursday.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.8235 from $1.8385 late
Thursday. In New York trading, it cost $1.8240 to buy one pound,
less expensive than Thursday's $1.8330.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday, included: 1.69575 West German marks, up from 1.69165;
1.4040 Swiss francs, down from 1.4045; 5.7590 French francs, up
from 5.7455; 1,255.50 Italian lire, up from 1.252.50, and 1.24885
Canadian dollars, down from 1.24925.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday,

   Bridgestone Corp. of Japan plans to create
the most-technologically advanced tire company in the world when it
purchases Firestone Tire & Rubber Co., Bridgestone President Akira
Yeiri said Friday.
   Firestone's board of directors recommended Thursday that
shareholders accept Bridgestone's offer to purchase Firestone's 32
million outstanding shares for $80 a share. Bridgestone was spurred
to make the $2.6 billion offer Thursday because of an unsolicited
offer from Italian tiremaker Pirelli SpA.
   Pirelli did not make a counter offer Friday. The Italian firm
said in a news release that it will await the merger of Bridgestone
and Firestone before making a final decision on terminating its
$58-a-share offer.
   Firestone stock soared $15.25 a share to close at $77.75 Friday
on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Firestone shareholders meet in Akron on Tuesday.
   Yeiri said Bridgestone, which employs 32,500 people worldwide,
wants to become a global tiremaker with the most efficient
production facilities and the most effective marketing organization
in the world.
   ``The Bridgestone-Firestone alliance brings together many
complimentary strengths,'' Yeiri told a news conference at
Firestone's North American tire headquarters in Akron. ``Together
we have the design and manufacturing capability necessary to build
high-quality tires and to improve our global competitive position.''
   Bridgestone plans to keep Firestone's corporate offices in
Chicago and its North American tire headquarters in Akron, he said.
All of Firestone's North American plants will remain in operation,
he said.
   In the meantime, Bridgestone still plans to move its North
American sales operation from Los Angeles to Nashville, Tenn.
Bridgestone purchased a plant outside Nashville from Firestone in
1983.
   Firestone employs 55,000 people worldwide, including 1,650 in
the Akron area. The company has streamlined itself to the number of
employees needed to operate effectively, Yeiri said. No changes are
planned in Firestone management, he said.
   The two operations complement one another, Yeiri said. Firestone
has production plants in the United States, Canada, Europe and
Latin America, he said, while Bridgestone has a strong sales
network in Asia and Australia.
   Yeiri also noted that Firestone provides original equipment to
Ford and General Motors and has made considerable progress in the
international market with Porche, Volvo, Audi and Volkswagon.
Original equipment is Bridgestone's weakest area, he said.
   Although financing for the purchase hasn't been worked out,
Yeiri said he thinks 50 percent of the purchase price will come
from Bridgestone assets, and Bridgestone will borrow the rest. The
Japanese tire maker decided $80 a share would be a fair offer after
consulting with investment bankers, he said.
   In mid-February, Firestone announced an agreement to sell 75
percent of its worldwide tire manufacturing business to Bridgestone
for $1.5 billion. But that agreement was in jeopardy after Pirelli
launched its tender offer for the entire company last week.
   Akron officials were pleased about Bridgestone's plans to keep
Firestone's Akron operations intact.
   ``The commitment to say we're going to do everything we can to
keep the operations in place with everyone working where they are _
it's good news for Akron,'' said Mayor Don Plusquellic.

   Stock prices bounced around in a narrow range
Friday, meeting with some resistance from sellers at their highest
levels since Black Monday last fall.
   A quarterly ``triple witching hour'' passed without any dramatic
swings in the market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up 1.33 to
2,087.37, stretching its gain for the week to 52.39 points.
   But declining issues outnumbered advances by about 8 to 7 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 716 up, 807 down and 461 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 245.75 million shares, against 211.92
million in the previous session. The NYSE's composite index slipped
.03 to 152.65.
   Activity was swollen by the quarterly witching hour involving a
group of expiring options and futures on stock indexes that are
used in large-scale computer program trading.
   Settlement of one key futures contract was done based on stock
prices as of the opening. Reports from the NYSE of preopening order
imbalances were on the buy side.
   The rest of the settlement process was conducted at the close,
with a few preclosing order imbalances leaning to the sell side.
   Beyond that, analysts said the market drew some added benefit
from Thursday's news of a smaller-than-expected trade deficit in
January, with imports exceeding exports by $12.44 billion.
   But prices fell back from their midsession peaks as traders
moved to cash in on the market's recent gains.
   Takeover news and rumors continued at their recent frenetic pace.
   Firestone Tire & Rubber jumped 15\ to 77} in active trading. The
company agreed Thursday to be acquired by Bridgestone of Japan for
$80 a share, in a deal that topped a previous $58-a-share bid by
Pirelli Group of Italy.
   Roper Corp. climbed 5} to 53. Whirlpool Corp. raised its offer
for Roper to $50 a share, surpassing a $45-a-share bid by General
Electric.
   Grumman, which has been moving up lately on unconfirmed takeover
rumors, rose 1~ to 25.
   Sabine Corp. gained 1} to 20{. The company, opposing a
$20-a-share offer from Presidio Oil, said it was holding
preliminary talks with another party.
   Pillsbury dropped 2] to 43. The company reported a $107.8
million loss for the quarter ended Feb. 28 and said its Godfather's
Pizza restaurant chain might be sold.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $0.29 billion, or 0.01
percent, in value.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 274.91 million shares.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials dropped .14 to
314.64, and S&P's 500-stock composite index was down .10 at 271.12.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
.88 to 381.58. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 299.11, up .12.

<HEAD>In Days Prior to Boesky Surrender, Whereabouts Undisclosed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Less than a week before insider trader Ivan F.
Boesky was to start serving a federal prison term, officials
declined to discuss his whereabouts Friday and there were
indications he might already be in custody.
   The mystery of the ex-financier's location came against a
background of death threats made against him, raising the
possibility that he might have sought federal protection prior to
his scheduled surrender date of March 24.
   Boesky, the central figure in Wall Street's biggest insider
trading scandal, was sentenced to a three-year prison term for
securities fraud last Dec. 18 by U.S. District Judge Morris E.
Lasker.
   The judge recommended that the ex-financier spend the time at a
minimum security facility in Lompoc, Calif. He permitted Boesky to
remain free pending the surrender date.
   But according to the Bureau of Prison's computerized prison
locator service in Washington, Boesky was listed as ``in transit,''
meaning he was no longer free on bail and was in custody.
   Locator service dispatchers, who declined to be identified by
name, said Boesky had been assigned a prisoner identification
number, 139-87-054. The last three digits indicated he was in the
jurisdiction of the federal marshal's office in Manhattan, they
said.
   Flip Lorenzoni, an official of the marshal's office, said he
could not comment on Boesky's whereabouts and referred inquiries to
a regional office in Philadelphia.
   That office referred questions to Bureau of Prisons spokeswoman
Kathryn Morse, who said a prison was chosen for Boesky a few weeks
ago but she declined to identify it until after his arrival, in
accordance with government policy. She would not comment on whether
Boesky already had been placed in custody.
   John Carroll, an assistant U.S. attorney handling the Boesky
case, declined to discuss Boesky's whereabouts, saying, ``That's
not a question I'm inclined to answer.''
   Boesky's attorney, Theodore Levine, did not return repeated
telephone calls to his Washington office.
   Officials familiar with the federal prisoner assignment system
said it was likely that Boesky would go to Lompoc, a former Army
barracks near the Pacific coast about 150 miles northwest of Los
Angeles.
   In a telephone interview, Lompoc warden Richard Rison declined
to confirm or deny Boesky's impending arrival but said highly
publicized prisoners tended to check in unannounced before their
surrender deadline, in order to avoid press photographers at the
gate.
   ``If I was speculating, I would say he won't be here on the
24th,'' Rison said. ``I just wouldn't believe he'd plan to come
with a lot of fanfare.''
   Rison emphasized his remarks did not necessarily mean Boesky had
been assigned to Lompoc.
   Formerly one of Wall Street's best-known speculators, Boesky was
fined a record $100 million in November 1986 to settle charges of
insider trading, which is the illicit use of confidential corporate
information to profit in securities trading.
   Under a plea-bargain arrangement, Boesky promised to cooperate
in implicating others in exchange for pleading guilty to a single
felony count _ conspiracy to lie to the SEC, which carried a
maximum punishment of five years imprisonment and $250,000 fine.
   Boesky's cooperation has raised expectatations of major
indictments for securities fraud on Wall Street.
   Last month John Mulheren, a former Boesky friend and fellow
stock speculator, was arrested on charges he plotted to kill Boesky
and a Boesky aide because he thought they had implicated him.

<HEAD>Cattle-On-Feed Report on Target</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL A. DRISCOLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Livestock futures prices advanced Friday on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange as traders jockeyed their positions before the
government released its cattle-on-feed report.
   On other markets, oil futures moved higher for the fourth
consecutive day, wheat was higher while corn and soybeans declined,
and Treasury bonds retreated sharply.
   The cattle-on-feed report, released by the Agriculture
Department after the close of trading, was not far off from what
was expected.
   The data probably will be only slightly bearish for the nearby
April and June contracts, said Chuck Levitt, an analyst in Chicago
with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   The survey of seven leading cattle states indicated that there
were 6 percent more cattle on feed as of March 1 than a year
earlier. The number of animals placed on feed during February was 5
percent fewer than 12 months ago, while the marketings was put at 3
percent above the year-ago figure.
   Because the distant contract months are at a substantial
discount to the nearby deliveries, traders will be inclined to sell
April and June deliveries and buy the back months, Levitt said.
   Live cattle settled .05 cent lower to .22 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in April at 73.77 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .10 cent to .32 cent higher with March at 82.12 cents a
pound; live hogs were .30 cent lower to .40 cent higher with April
at 46.20 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .25 cent lower
to 1.65 cents higher with March at 55.80 cents a pound.
   Oil futures prices advanced for the fourth consecutive day on
the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Friday's advances were a continuation of a rally begun near the
close of the previous session after OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman
announced he'd have something to say next Tuesday about stabilizing
prices, said Nauman Barakat, a analyst in New York with Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   ``My feeling, though, is that they won't do anything but
continue to talk up the market for a couple weeks,'' he said.
``After that, the seasonal demand for gasoline will pick up and so
OPEC won't have to do anything to shore up prices.''
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 13 cents to 30 cents
higher with the April contract at $16.58 a barrel; heating oil was
.52 cent to .83 cent higher with April at 45.05 cents a gallon; and
unleaded gasoline was .16 cent to .39 cent higher with April at
45.99 cents a gallon.
   Treasury bond futures plunged sharply on the Chicago Board of
Trade, responding to what analysts said were renewed fears of
inflation.
   Thursday's balance of trade figures helped the dollar and the
bond market initially, but further examination of the data gave the
markets a different view, said Jack Barbanel, an analyst in New
York with Gruntal & Co.
   Inflation fears came not only from the trade data, he said, but
also from the rising CRB Index, which was partially influenced by
the $1-a-barrel gain by oil over the last four sessions.
   Treasury bonds lost 1 9-32 points, with the June contract
settling at 91 1-32 points.
   Wheat futures prices advanced while soybeans and corn skidded
lower on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   ``Wheat was about the only market that showed any strength,''
said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Soybeans dropped about a nickel a bushel despite heavy buying
again Friday by a large speculator who triggered a strong rally on
Thursday.
   Friday's buying by the C & D Commodities was accompanied by
heavy selling of soybean options, negating any strong response by
other traders, said Lespinasse.
   He said beans were under pressure from selling by South American
interests and by traders unloading contracts before the weekend.
   Increased farmer selling overnight weakened the corn market.
   A rumor that the Agriculture Department was about to make an
announcement of a large offer of subsidized wheat helped that
grain, said Lespinasse.
   After the close, the USDA said it offered the Soviet Union 1
million tons of wheat.
   Wheat settled 1{ cents to 3{ cents higher with the March
contract at $2.99 a bushel; corn was { cent to 1 cent lower with
March at $1.98 a bushel; oats were unchanged to 3} cents higher
with March at $1.96 a bushel; and soybeans were 3\ cents to 6 cents
lower with March at $6.20 a bushel.
   Precious metals futures posted gains on the Commodity Exchange
in New York.
   Gold was 30 cents higher with the April contract at $445.20 a
troy ounce; and silver was 6 cents to 6.1 cents higher with March
at $6.365 a troy ounce.

   Young families trying to purchase their first
home and low-income families struggling to meet escalating rental
payments are two groups which have suffered the most from flawed
housing policies in the 1980s, according to a new study released
Thursday.
   ``America is increasingly becoming a nation of housing haves and
have-nots,'' said H. James Brown, one of the authors of the report
and the director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard
University. ``While a majority of Americans are well-housed, too
many Americans have not been able to share in this prosperity.''
   The report, titled ``The State of the Nation's Housing,''
contended that the number of Americans unable to secure decent and
affordable housing was growing at an alarming rate. Among its
findings:
   _Since 1981, rental costs including utilities, have risen 14
percent faster than prices generally. After adjusting for
inflation, rental costs are now at their highest level in two
decades.
   _The steep increase in rental costs means that single-parent
households must devote 58.4 percent of their incomes to rent,
compared to 34.9 percent in 1974.
   _Homeownership rates have fallen steadily during this decade,
particularly among young people. In 1980, 43.3 percent of
households in the 24-29 age group owned their own home, a figure
that has now declined to 35.9 percent.
   _The after-tax cost of buying a typical first home in 1987 was
$7,449, or 32.4 percent of the average annual income of potential
first-time buyers, about 50 percent higher than the share of income
required in the early 1970s.
   The study, which was financed by a grant from the Ford
Foundation and several housing trade groups, did not make any
recommendations for needed changes in government policy.
   The Reagan administration has been criticized in the past for
its efforts to scale back federal housing assistance programs, but
Brown said it was important to realize that the country's housing
problems were a result of a number of forces which have been at
work well before the current administration took office.
   In reacting to the report, Carl D. Covitz, undersecretary of the
Department of Housing and Urban Development, said that the
administration was proud of its efforts in the past seven years to
boost housing subsidies to low-income families but realized ``much
more needs to be done.''
   ``It's never been easy for the typical family to buy their first
home or for very low-income people to afford decent housing and the
Harvard study performs a valuable service by pointing up some of
the very real problems still faced by many American families,''
Covitz said in a statement.
   William Apgar, another author of the report, said that one
particular problem was that even minimal federal housing assistance
was reaching only one in four families in need.
   ``Only one in four rentor households with incomes at or below
the poverty level live in public housing or receive some other form
of federal housing assistance,'' Apgar said.

   The nation's farm sector is continuing a
strong recovery that began in 1987 with record-high net cash
income, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   Cash income is still expected to recede from last year's $57
billion to between $50 billion and $55 billion in 1988, the
department's Economic Research Service said in a new outlook report.
   The projected decline will result from lower livestock receipts,
rising expenses and lower government payments, the report said.
Those will more than offset a rise in 1988 crop receipts.
   Net cash income is the difference between gross cash income and
cash expenses in the calendar year.
   ``The income and debt-service problems that plagued agriculture
during the 1980s have largely been weathered, although financial
problems persist for some producers who acquired long-term debt at
high interest rates,'' the report said.
   ``A major contributor to increased cash flow is a marked
reduction in interest expenses since the difficult 1980-83 years.''
   Economists said receipts from crop sales are improving as a
result of increased domestic and export demand for major
commodities, including wheat and corn.
   ``Receipts from livestock sales should be off slightly, as red
meat and poultry production expands almost 2 percent and prices
falter,'' the report said. ``Fruit prices this spring will be below
a year ago as larger supplies come to market.''

<HEAD>Pillsbury Stock Jumps Following Rumors of Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Speculation that Pillsbury Co. had been
targeted for a takeover bid sent the food and restaurant company's
stock soaring for a second straight day Thursday.
   Pillsbury jumped $3.50 a share to close at $45.50 a share in
heavy New York Stock Exchange composite trading. About 3.48 million
shares changed hands compared with average trading volume in the
stock of 1.1 million shares a day.
   Analysts speculated that potential buyers included Swiss-based
Nestle S.A., Beatrice Co. of Chicago and New York investor Saul
Steinberg.
   Pillsbury spokesman Johnny Thompson declined to comment Thursday
on whether the company has received any offers. The company's
rumored suitors earlier had also declined to comment.
   ``Anything could be true here,'' said Robert Cummins, food
industry analyst at Wertheim Schroder & Co. in New York. ``The main
story is that Nestle wants to acquire them for $55 per share.''
   Piper Jaffray & Hopwood analyst Stephen Carnes said he suspects
the rumors have Pillbury's executives ``scrambling for an
acquisition'' to increase their company's debt and make it a less
desirable takeover target.
   The management at Beatrice, which went private in 1986, has
nearly finished retiring the debt incurred in its leveraged buyout
of the company. Under chairman Donald Kelly, Beatrice has profited
from divesting itself of some units and is said to be looking to
acquire a whole food company.
   Carnes said Wednesday he doubts that Kelly is interested in
Pillsbury for its ``breakup'' value. Instead, Carnes, a former
Pillsbury executive, said rumblings of a $55-a-share offer by
Nestle ``make more sense.''
   Analysts have been expecting Pillsbury to announce a
restructuring _ including the sale of its Steak & Ale, Bennigan's
and Godfather's restaurant operations _ since chairman John
Stafford resigned last month. Interim chairman William Spoor has
insisted Pillsbury's largest restaurant operation, the Burger King
fast-food chain, is not for sale.
   Pillsbury's announcement in February of lower-than-expected
earnings for the fiscal year ended in May preceded Stafford's Feb.
29 departure.

<HEAD>Whirlpool Ups Offer, Sues GE in Bid for Roper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BENTON HARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roper Corp. said Friday it accepted
a sweetened $470 million buyout offer from Whirlpool Corp., which
filed suit charging that General Electric Corp. tried to
``sabotage'' the deal with a competing bid.
   Roper said its board reviewed both offers before recommending
Whirlpool's $50-a-share cash tender offer to shareholders.
   On the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Roper's stock jumped
$5.75 a share to close at $53.
   The bid tops the $37.50-a-share Whirlpool offer made last month,
which prompted a bidding war for the Augusta, Ga.-based maker of
garden equipment and cooking ranges. On March 6, GE said it would
pay $45 a share, or about $423 million, for Roper's outstanding
shares.
   Whirlpool Chairman David R. Whitwam said the higher bid
``underscores Whirlpool's determination to complete our agreed-upon
merger with Roper, despite the deliberate and heavy-handed
interference of General Electric.''
   In a suit filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Grand Rapids,
Whirlpool charged that GE knew Whirlpool and Roper had signed an
acquisition agreement and intentionally sought to block that merger.
   The suit seeks a court order barring GE from acquiring any
interest in Roper or interfering in a Whirlpool-Roper merger.
   Whirlpool alleged that the head of GE's appliance business
personally tried to persuade Roper to break its contract with
Whirlpool. The suit said GE ``intentionally, maliciously and
unjustifiedly engaged in a continuing course of conduct to
sabotage'' the deal.
   Bruce Bunch, a spokesman at GE headquarters in Fairfield, Conn.,
said the lawsuit ``grossly misstates the facts and is utterly
without merit.''
   ``We clearly have not'' interfered, he said. ``Our offer is
directly to the Roper shareowners.''
   Analysts say the merger will move Whirlpool ahead of GE as the
nation's leading appliance maker. Whirlpool has said it would
expand Roper from a maker of ranges into a producer and marketer of
a full line of appliances.
   ``Roper has a strong desire to see this combination successfully
completed,'' said Roper Chief Executive Officer Robert Cook.
Whirlpool's Whitwam also noted that the merger is of strategic
importance.
   On Thursday, Whirlpool and GE disclosed that the Federal Trade
Commission was investigating the outstanding tender offers for
Roper. Both companies indicated they would respond promptly.
   Whirlpool said in a statement that a thorough FTC review would
``conclude that a GE takeover would have serious anti-competitive
effects.''
   Whirlpool extended its offer through midnight EST March 31.

   Bond prices dropped Friday in active trading,
pressured by resurgent anxiety about inflation.
   The losses were steepest in longer-maturing issues.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond tumbled about 1{
point, or $15 for every $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which
moves inversely to its price, soared to 8.67 percent from 8.53
percent late Thursday.
   The retreat reversed a brisk increase on Thursday, inspired by a
government report on the U.S. merchandise trade deficit for
January, which pushed the 30-year bond up about $7.50 per $1,000.
   Analysts said bond prices were weakened by unconfirmed reports
that the Federal Reserve is concerned about a possible reigniting
of inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income securities
such as bonds. Also, oil prices continued to rise Friday, signaling
a possible recurrence of inflation.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for April
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude oil,
jumped 30 cents to $16.58 per 42-gallon barrel.
   ``The bond market got hit pretty hard,'' said Jay Goldinger, a
principal of Capital Insight Inc., an investment firm in Beverly
Hills, Calif. ``The market's scared of its shadow right now, and so
it's running.''
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues declined 3-16 point to 9-32 point, intermediate
maturities fell ] point to 13-16 point, and 20-year issues dropped
about 1 5-16 point, according to figures provided by Telerate Inc.,
a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures price
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, was down 0.59 at 112.34. The Shearson Lehman
Treasury Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, dropped
7.17 to 1,175.03.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, fell 1.19 to 283.08.
   In the municipal bond market, the Bond Buyer index of 40
actively traded general obligation and revenue bonds fell ] point
to 88 15-32 as of 3 p.m. EST. The average yield rose to 8.11
percent from 8.07 percent late Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills, meanwhile, jumped 13 basis
points to 5.69 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a
percentage point. Six-month bills advanced 12 basis points to 5.84
percent and one-year bills rose 8 basis points to 6.26 percent.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted late in the day at 6] percent, down from 6 7-16
percent late Thursday.

   International Paper Co. said Friday it planned
to begin discussions with union representatives aimed at resolving
bitter labor disputes at several plants around the country.
   Officials for the company and the United Paperworkers
International Union said they had agreed to meet with
intermediaries within the next several weeks.
   The meetings are intended to defuse the hostility between
management and labor and set up a framework for pursuing the
company's labor problems on a local level, the company said.
   The company and the union have been at odds for more than a year
over contracts that have come up for renewal. At the heart of the
disagreements is the issue of whether local contracts should
restore premium pay for Sundays and holidays.
   Premium pay had been eliminated with labor's approval from past
contracts, but since the industry's fortunes have improved in the
last year, the union has campaigned to revive the benefit.
   ``The parties recognize that continuation of the adversarial
relationship is not in the best interests of either party and have
committed themselves not only to resolution of the current disputes
but to building a proper relationship for the future,'' said a
statement released from the company's headquarters in Purchase, N.Y.
   Bob Frase, assistant to the president of the union, which is
based in Nashville, Tenn., said the union was encouraged by the
prospect of the talks.
   ``Anytime we can sit down and talk, that's positive,'' said
Frase.
   But he cautioned, as did the company, that the talks would not
involve formal contract negotiations. A final resolution of the
disputes, affecting at least seven plants, might be hammered out
later at the local level, the company suggested.
   About 3,500 workers in four locations are embroiled in contract
fights. In Mobile, Ala., 1,200 workers have been locked out of
their jobs by the company; while an additional 2,300 have struck
plants in Jay, Maine; Lock Haven, Pa.; and DePere, Wis., Frase said.
   Contracts also are open Pine Bluff and Camden, Ark., and
Natchez, Miss., said Holly Kinser, a spokeswoman for the company.
   Analysts who follow International Paper said the talks were a
step in the right direction.
   ``It can be significant, if out of it comes a settlement,'' said
Lawrence Ross of the investment firm PaineWebber Group Inc.
   Although the company's plants have continued to operate through
the disturbances, the analysts said the bitter struggle with the
union has hindered the company's performance at a time when the
industry has turned profitable.
   ``The mills are all running (with replacement workers), but
efficiency has been affected,'' said Mark Rogers of
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   The company said it earned $305 million in 1986 and expects to
post earnings of $407 million for 1987 when final figures are
released next week. However, the company said its profitability was
below the industry average in both 1986 and 1987, when measured in
terms of its net worth.
   The announcement said the company and the union had asked
Malcolm R. Lovell Jr., a professor of government and business at
George Washington University, and Gayle Wineriter, special
assistant to the director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation
Service, to assist in the talks.
   The stock market greeted the news indifferently, sending
International Paper shares down 25 cents to $44.37{ per share in
New York Stock Exchange trading.

<HEAD>January Court Date Set in Polaroid Patent Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Friday set a January court date in
Polaroid Corp.'s $5.7 billion patent infringement claim against
Eastman Kodak Co.
   Judge Rya Zobel set a Jan. 9, 1989, trial date in the
12-year-old case and ordered pre-trial evidence be presented to the
court on July 27.
   In 1985, Zobel ruled that Kodak had infringed on seven of about
150 Polaroid patents on instant cameras and film.
   In January 1986, Zobel barred the Rochester, N.Y.-based Kodak
from the instant photography business, pioneered by Polaroid.
   The damage award amount, filed last month in federal court in
Boston, has increased Polaroid stock value and also triggered
speculation that a corporate raider may seek control of the
Cambridge-based company in anticipation of a big settlement.
   Kodak, however, has labeled the claim as ``ludicrous'' and
excessively high. Several analysts predict a settlement between $1
billion to $2 billion.
   A $1 billion award would translate to about $10 per share for
Polaroid.
   Polaroid, which was trading in the low $20 a share before the
damage claim was announced, closed Friday down { at $34\ on the New
York Stock Exchange. Kodak closed down } at $42.
   Polaroid claims $3.2 billion in lost camera and film sales and
seeks an additional $2.5 billion for lost opportunities to develop
and market new products.
   Polaroid, which introduced instant photography in 1948, held a
monopoly in the field until Kodak entered the market in the late
1970s.
   Polaroid camera sales peaked at 7.5 million in 1978 before
sinking to 3.4 million in 1984. Sales rebounded to 4.4 million in
1986 after the introduction of the Spectra camera, which offered
better quality prints, but fell 16 percent last year.
   Polaroid next month plans to introduce two new cameras, the
Spectra 600 and Image.

<HEAD>Black & Decker Makes Firm $77 Offer For American Standard</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS GINSBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black & Decker Corp. Friday sweetened its bid
again for American Standard Inc. to $77 per share, or about $2.4
billion cash, one day after the plumbing conglomerate's board
approved a $78-per-share leveraged buyout.
   ``We believe that our offer of $77 in the light of timing and
probability of payment (from the leveraged buyout) represents a
better choice for American Standard stockholders,'' Black & Decker
Chairman Nolan B. Archibald said in a statement.
   American Standard, which has fought Black & Decker's bid for
nearly two months, said after a marathon board meeting Thursday
that it would recommend its stockholders accept a $2.45 billion
cash offer led by Kelso & Co., a New York investment banking firm
specializing in employee-led leveraged buyouts.
   The Kelso buyout plan _ under which an employee stock ownership
plan, or ESOP, would acquire 20 percent of the company _ topped
Black & Decker's previous bid of $73 a share, or $2.3 billion.
   Stephen F. Page, Black & Decker's treasurer and vice president
for finance, said officials of the Towson, Md.-based tool and
appliance maker were confident they could acquire American
Standard. But he indicated they were reaching their limit.
   ``It's always tough to say never,'' Page said. ``But I don't see
what would be there to make us go higher. I just have a hard time
seeing anything there.''
   American Standard spokeswoman Lois Stewart said the company
would have no comment.
   Black & Decker initially proposed a buyout at $65 a share, later
sweetening its bid to $68 and finally to $73, before making its
latest bid.
   American Standard fell 50 cents to close at $75.87{ a share on
the New York Stock Exchange Friday. Black & Decker closed at
$20.62{, up $1.12{ a share.
   American Standard has about 31.5 million common shares
outstanding.
   Black & Decker's bid came despite analysts' speculation Thursday
that the bidding war for American Standard was over, citing the
size of the premium Kelso was offering over the market price.
   But Black & Decker said it hiked the bid again ``after reviewing
the information supplied by American Standard (and) after a due
diligence session with American Standard management.''
   Black & Decker also cited a Delaware court ruling on Tuesday
``invalidating the golden parachute and pension fund lock-up put
into place by American Standard after Black & Decker commenced its
offer.''
   Archibald said the action of the court ``would have justified an
additional increase, but we have to take into account the break-up
fees and other costs that American Standard has incurred since the
date of that decision.''
   Black & Decker set midnight March 31 as an expiration date for
its tender offer.
   American Standard, a maker of plumbing and air conditioning
equipment, said its definitive agreement with Kelso is subject to
Kelso obtaining necessary financing.
   American Standard said Kelso planned to finance the deal through
a $1.8 billion loan to be syndicated by Bankers Trust Co.; a $900
million short-term ``bridge'' loan from First Boston Securities
Corp., an affiliate of the investment bank; and $250 million of
common equity from Kelso and certain institutional investors.
   Kelso specializes in leveraged buyouts involving employee stock
ownership plans, or ESOPs, a concept it pioneered about 30 years
ago.
   The company added it expected a newly formed ESOP would acquire
about 20 percent of American Standard's common shares.
   In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired largely through
borrowed money repaid from the target company's profits or sale of
assets. ESOPs also are financed mostly with borrowed funds, but
equity is divided among all of the company's workers rather than
just a few investors.
   Ms. Stewart said American Standard, which repeatedly rejected
Black & Decker's earlier overtures, had received several offers but
she refused to identify the bidders.
   Page said Black & Decker plans to sell American Standard's
transportation division.
   Under the Kelso offer, American Standard's management likely
would remain largely intact but the company might be forced to sell
its transportation division and New York headquarters to help
reduce debt incurred in the buyout.

<TEXT>
   Thirteen people were charged Friday in a
worldwide, $400,000-a-week money-laundering operation run by
Israelis in the United States on behalf of two men in Colombia.
   The network laundered $25 million since at least late 1986,
mainly through nearly 40 banks in the New York metropolitan area,
Seattle, and Los Angeles for ultimate deposit in Panama,
prosecutors said.
   At least ten suspects were arrested Friday in Washington, New
Jersey and California. They included a rabbi and two former flight
attendants nearly nine months pregnant.
   According to documents filed in federal court here, Adi Tal, a
27-year-old Israeli and former El Al Airlines employee, supervised
the U.S. operations, coordinating operations in the three states.
   He reported the activities to his superiors in Cali, Colombia,
identified as Enrique Korc and Kimaro, last name unknown, according
to U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr. in Newark.
   The defendants were charged with conspiring to violate federal
laws requiring that transactions of more than $10,000 be reported.
The charge carries a five-year prison term.
   The defendants allegedly deposited smaller amounts of cash in
banks in the United States and transferred the funds in the form of
checks, money orders and cashier's checks shipped in parcels for
deposit mainly in the Banco Cafetero in Panama City, Panama, Alito
said.
   Authorities refused to say what the source of the money was, or
where it went after reaching the Panamanian bank. The case was
investigated by the Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Customs Service
and Drug Enforcement Administration.
   Attorney Clifford N. Kuhn Jr., representing Tal, his 26-year-old
wife Jacqueline and another married couple at their initial
appearance Friday, said he could not comment on the case because he
had not discussed it with his clients in detail.
   Asked if the cash resulted from drug sales, he commented: ``I
think that's what they're alleging, but I'm not quite sure.''
   Prosecutors also charged that some defendants illegally
transported hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash by plane to
England and West Germany.
   Tal, who authorities said moved to Edison this month from
Woodland Hills, Calif., allegedly supervised Nir Goldeshstein, 27,
of Edison and the two men's wives in operations in the New York
area.
   Each family had access to hundreds of thousands of dollars, had
ties to Israel and had established ``nest eggs'' there in case they
had to flee, Assistant U.S. Attorney Stuart Rabner said in court
arguments.
   Tal and Goldeshstein were ordered held without bail until a
hearing Monday by U.S. Magistrate Stanley R. Chesler.
   Hedges set bail at $50,000 for Mrs. Tal and Goldeshtein's wife,
Zoe Lawton, 23, both pregnant and close to term.
   Arrested in Seattle were Baruch Zeltzer, 32; Sergio Dias, 26;
Avi Hazan, 24; and Rabbi Shalom Levitan, said U.S. Attorney Gene S.
Anderson.
   Charged in California were Moshe Begim, 25; Guy Marom, 26, both
of West Hollywood; and Alon Redko, 32, from the Los Angeles area,
said Alito. All were arrested by Friday afternoon except Redko,
Rabner said.
   Tal, Goldeshtein, Zeltzer, Hazan, Begim, Marom and Redko are
Israeli citizens, Rabner said.
   Levitan holds a ``supervisory position'' at Chabad House, a
community center for the Lubavitch Hasidic community, Anderson said.
   The suspects referred to quantities of money as diamond karats
in intercepted telephone calls, according to a Custom Service
agent's affidavit filed with the court.
   Ms. Lawton was a flight attendant for Trans World Airlines, and
Mrs. Tal was an attendant for Northwest Airlines, said the 55-page
document.
   Both have family members in Seattle and Mrs. Tal grew up in
Panama, Rabner told the judge.
   Tal and Goldeshtein were not employed but were planning to open
a private mail drop business in Edison where customers could ship
packages, rent beepers and purchase money orders, among other
things, the affidavit said.

<HEAD>Texaco's Final Back-Tax Bill Probably Less than $1 Billion, Not
$6.5 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc. suggested late Friday that back
taxes owed to the federal government likely would total less than
$1 billion, not the $6.5 billion originally suggested two months
ago.
   The oil giant made the suggestion in an announcement that it had
reached a framework agreement to review all tax claims with the
Internal Revenue Service. The agreement removed one of the last
remaining impediments to Texaco's efforts to extricate itself from
federal bankruptcy protection.
   The nation's third-largest oil company sought bankruptcy court
refuge nearly a year ago because of a protracted court struggle
with the much smaller Pennzoil Co., which held a $10.3 billion
damage claim against Texaco.
   Pennzoil won the mammoth judgment from a Texas jury that decided
Texaco had wrecked Pennzoil's agreement to buy part of Getty Oil
Co. in 1984 by acquiring Getty itself.
   Last December Pennzoil agreed to drop the claim in exchange for
$3 billion cash, setting in motion a complex process under which
Texaco would emerge from bankruptcy as a smaller restructured
company.
   But under the bankruptcy laws, Texaco's other creditors had to
state their estimated claims against the company before it emerged
from bankruptcy. In January the IRS, as a priority creditor,
indicated Texaco might owe $6.5 billion in back taxes based on an
audit of the company for 1965 through 1986.
   If the IRS were correct, industry analysts said, the back taxes
would likely have crippled the company.
   The IRS claim stemmed from a theory the agency had developed
that would have raised the market value of Saudi oil handled by
Texaco during some of the years in question. Theoretically, the IRS
might have demanded Texaco pay taxes on what the company would have
earned had it sold the oil for a higher price.
   Although analysts were certain the final tax bill would total
much less, the agreement announced Friday marked the first time a
figure in the $1 billion range was suggested.
   Under the agreement, Texaco will make cash deposits against tax
claims totaling $1 billion over a four-year period, with the first
installment of $200 million on the date its bankruptcy
reorganization is approved and $200 million thereafter on each of
the next four anniversary dates.
   Texaco's announcement implied the final bill might even be less
than $1 billion because of a provision that any leftover money will
be returned to the company. The company also downplayed the
significance of the IRS claim compared with the taxes Texaco pays
during the course of one year.
   ``The amount of the deposits provided for in the agreement,
which cover outstanding tax claims spanning a period of 13 years,
should be viewed in the context of the $3.8 billion in direct taxes
the company incurred in 1987 alone on its $35.8 billion in business
revenue worldwide,'' Texaco said.
   Texaco officials declined to comment further because of what
they called an arrangement with the IRS not to elaborate on the
agreement.
   Ellen Murphy, public affairs director for the IRS in Washington,
said the $1 billion figure represented only money to be deposited
for claims and ``obviously it's too soon to say what size liability
we're talking about.''
   Nevertheless, accountants familiar with IRS policies on large
back-tax claimssuggested that if the agency felt Texaco might owe
more than $1 billion, it would have demanded a bigger deposit.
