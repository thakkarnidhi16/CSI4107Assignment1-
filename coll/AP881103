   A burglar who stole a heart surgeon's
instruments from a rented car has put the doctor out of operation
for as much as three months.
   Among the tools stolen from Dr. Beethoven Brown was a custom-fit
pair of magnifying eyeglasses that provide closeups of small blood
vessels.
   ``Basically, it is extremely difficult to see the coronary
arteries without them,'' Brown said Tuesday. ``Therefore it is
impossible to work without them.''
   Having a new, individually fitted set of the $1,200 glasses made
could take three months, Brown said. Meantime, he will have to
restrict himself to nonsurgical treatment and rely on colleagues to
perform operations.
   ``It's depressing,'' Brown said.
   The customized glasses, contained in a wooden box with his name
on it, are no good to anyone else, he added, saying he will gladly
take them back at his Miami office, no questions asked.

   Political pundits disagree on how lopsided an
election must be to qualify as a landslide, but seasoned candidates
George Bush and Michael Dukakis each could write a chapter in the
book of landslide lore.
   Both men in the past have buried their share of opponents and
been buried themselves. Which of their House, Senate and
gubernatorial races can be classified as landslides _ and what it
will take to claim a landslide on Tuesday _ depends on which analyst
is doing the analyzing.
   William Schneider, a Washington-based political analyst, said
Democratic and Republican candidates generally can count on getting
at least 40 percent of the popular vote without doing much of
anything.
   It's the dogfight for the middle 20 percent that makes or breaks
a landslide, he says.
   ``Sixty percent is earthshaking, 55 percent gives you a landslide
and you can get a solid majority of the electoral vote with just 52
or 53 percent of the popular vote,'' Schneider said.
   Stephen Hess, a senior fellow in government studies at the
Brookings Institution, believes anything outside the ``47th- and
53rd-yard lines'' in the popular vote is a landslide.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo's standards are a bit more lax.
   ``I believe I have defined a landslide as 52 percent (or more),''
he said last week as he predicted Dukakis would win on Tuesday but
``maybe not by as large a landslide as I had figured.''
   Richard A. Brody, a political scientist at Stanford University,
says the definition of a landslide varies from election to election,
and is determined partly by how well a candidate does in comparison
with expectations.
   ``In my characterization, I would say a landslide was an
unexpectedly large share of the popular vote for a given
candidate,'' Brody said. ``... It's a term of art and people will
attribute to it whatever they wish.''
   The Dorsey Dictionary of American Politics doesn't play the
numbers game, instead defining a landslide as ``a decidedly lopsided
political victory, one in which the opponent is metaphorically
buried in a landslide.''
   It notes that Texan Lyndon Johnson earned the sarcastic moniker
``Landslide Lyndon'' when he was elected a senator by a majority of
just 87 votes out of a million cast.
   Bush and Dukakis have been on both ends of lopsided returns.
   Bush won his 1966 run for the House with a 57 percent to 43
percent victory over Democrat Frank Briscoe in Texas, won
re-election without opposition in 1968, and reveled in the 1980 and
1984 triumphs of the Reagan-Bush tickets.
   He was on the other end in two Senate races, in 1964 losing to
Democrat Ralph Yarborough by a 56-44 percent margin and in 1970
falling 54-46 to the man who now is Dukakis' running mate, Lloyd
Bentsen.
   In Democratic Massachusetts, Dukakis beat his GOP opponents for
the governorship by margins of 69 percent to 31 percent in 1986,
60-37 in 1982, and 54-42 in 1974.
   But in 1978, he was stunned when Edward King defeated him 51-42
in the Democratic primary. King went on to beat his GOP opponent by
a 53-47 margin _ which may or may not be a landslide, depending on
whose definition is used.
   Bush's double-digit lead in current polls could translate into a
landslide _ if the numbers hold.
   In presidential politics, even a slim lead in the popular vote
can translate into an Electoral College bonanza since each state
awards all its electoral votes to the popular vote winner even if
the candidate wins by just a hair.
   John White, a former chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, noted that Reagan won a modest 51 percent of the popular
vote in 1980 to Jimmy Carter's 41 percent, but garnered 489
electoral votes to Carter's 49.
   ``Under the theory of one man, one vote, or one woman, one vote,
it is not fair, but that's the way the law is,'' he said.
   Hess says the measuring stick for Electoral College landslides is
calibrated on the bigtime losses of the past.
   ``Alf Landon, Barry Goldwater, Fritz Mondale _ they are the
losers in landslides. ... Those are the compared-to's,'' he said.
   Those guys got buried.
   1936: Landon was out-polled 61 percent to 37 percent and got
eight electoral votes to Franklin D. Roosevelt's 523.
   1964: Goldwater lost 61-39 to Johnson and collected 52 electoral
votes to Johnson's 486.
   1984: Walter Mondale went down 59-41 to Ronald Reagan and claimed
just 13 electoral votes _ 10 from his home state of Minnesota _ to
Reagan's 525.
   George McGovern would feel right at home in that crowd _ he was
defeated by Richard Nixon by a 61 percent to 38 percent margin and
won 17 electoral votes to Nixon's 520.

<HEAD>Drug Tests Called Illegal `Periscope' into Private Lives</HEAD>

   The Supreme Court is studying government
drug-testing programs, which are being challenged in two key cases
as an unlawful ``periscope'' into the private lives of innocent
people.
   The court is expected to announce by July whether testing
programs for many railroad and Customs Service employees violate
their privacy rights.
   The two testing cases mark the first time the high court has
confronted the constitutionality of drug testing in the American
workplace.
   The justices were urged by the Reagan administration Wednesday to
uphold the drug tests. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh personally
argued part of the administration's case, underscoring the
importance attached to the issue.
   But Thornburgh stumbled a few times when the justices asked him
about details of the tests for railway workers.
   ``I'm not going to palm myself off on this court as an expert,''
Thornburgh said.
   He had difficulty answering questions about which railroad
workers were required to undergo the tests.
   Thornburgh last argued before the high court in 1977 when he
headed the Justice Department's criminal division.
   ``This is a case about railway safety,'' he said in defending
mandatory blood and urine tests for railroad workers after accidents
or rules violations.
   He said the case was about ``the hazards created by use of drugs
and alcohol by those in charge of trains.''
   While Thornburgh encountered some problems Wednesday, his
opponent in the case also faced sharp questioning.
   Lawrence Mann, an attorney for the railway workers, said the drug
tests are unconstitutional because they are incapable of proving
on-the-job impairment.
   For example, he said, the tests can show residue from a drug that
may have been taken ``by someone 60 days ago in the privacy of their
home.''
   Justice Antonin Scalia asked if it weren't ``reasonable for the
railroad to want to know'' if someone responsible for train safety
has ``cocaine traces'' in their system.
   The idea, Scalia continued, ``is to prevent someone using cocaine
from driving the train the next time.''
   Solicitor General Charles Fried, the Reagan administration's top
courtroom lawyer, defended the Customs Service program in which
urine tests are required for anyone applying for a promotion or
transfer to a job involving drug enforcement.
   Fried noted that critics of the drug tests call them a
``periscope'' probing the lives of people who are not suspected of
wrongdoing.
   But, Fried said, ``there is rather special, urgent and symbolic
significance'' in assuring the public that an agency responsible for
preventing drug smuggling has a drug-free workforce.
   ``The Customs Service is indeed entitled to take a fine filter to
show to itself, its workers and the public that (workers) are not
involved in drug use,'' he said.
   While few Customs Service workers have tested positive for drugs,
Fried said there may have been many who were scared off from
applying for key jobs because they knew drug use would be exposed.
   Lois Williams, representing the Customs Service employees, said
forcing workers to provide a urine sample while a test supervisor
waits outside a stall is a ``humiliating invasion of privacy.''
   She added that ``innocent persons have a great deal of reason to
be apprehensive'' about the program.
   Ms. Williams said the tests will turn up drugs used legitimately
with a doctor's prescription, and will force workers to justify
using the medication to their superiors.
   The eventual rulings by the court will not deal generally with
drug tests for private employees. But the decisions could have an
important psychological impact on whether businesses will demand
that their workers undergo such tests.
   Tests conducted by federal, state or local governments could be
affected directly by the court's action.
   In the railroad case, the Federal Railroad Administration issued
regulations in 1985 aimed at alleviating ``a significant safety
problem'' caused by alcohol and drug use among employees.
   The government said that from 1972 through 1983, railroad
accidents linked to drug or alcohol abuse killed 42 people, injured
61 and caused some $19 million in property damage.
   A federal appeals court struck down the tests for railway
workers. A different federal appeals court upheld tests for Customs
Service workers.

   Matthew Byrne thinks his son, Eddie, would have
cast a vote for George Bush on Tuesday _ if he had lived to vote.
Instead, the slain police officer has provided Bush with something
more powerful: a symbol.
   Byrne, 22, was killed last February, a casualty of the war
against illegal drugs. Now his police shield, which his father
presented to Bush last month, has become a potent totem for the vice
president's campaign.
   Again and again, Bush has pulled the badge out of his breast
pocket during speeches, held it aloft for the crowd to see and told
the story of how Matthew Byrne gave it to him. Of all the honors he
has received over the years, Bush says, ``none means more than
this.''
   Matthew Byrne, 54, a cop turned lawyer, isn't troubled that Bush
is getting political mileage out of his son's death.
   ``I don't have a problem with that,'' Byrne said in a telephone
interview. ``Eddie does stand as a symbol of the terrible
consequences of drugs ... and we don't feel that (Bush) is
exploiting his name.''
   Edward Byrne, a rookie police officer, was shot to death in his
patrol car on Feb. 26 as he guarded the home of a witness in a drug
case. The brazenness of the attack shocked the Police Department,
which deployed massive forces in an effort to track down the killers
and crush the drug trade in the neighborhood where the killing
occurred _ South Jamaica, Queens.
   It also galvanized the Byrne family. Within hours of the
shooting, Matthew Byrne was appearing in public to challenge
political leaders to ``put your money ... where your mouths are'' to
fight the drug trade.
   With donations they received in Eddie's memory, the Byrnes helped
form a foundation _ the Patrolman Edward R. Byrne Substance Abuse
Fund _ that makes grants to organizations involved in drug
education, prevention and rehabilitation.
   And Matthew Byrne has continued to speak out _ in schools, before
civic groups and law enforcement associations _ against illegal
drugs.
   ``We've had to come to grips with the terrible loss,'' the elder
Byrne said. ``But what we as a family decided to do was to take a
very negative event and try to turn it into something positive.''
   Byrne has criticized past efforts to fight drug abuse, blaming
Congress, not the Reagan administration. However, he did praise
Congress for recently passing the Omnibus Drug Bill, which provides
money for drug treatment, education and enforcement.
   The bill also permits the death penalty for drug-related
killings. Although Byrne insists that the death penalty is not the
sole basis for his support of Bush, it is obviously important. He
calls Michael Dukakis' opposition to the death penalty ``a
disgrace.''
   Byrne said he has been a registered Democrat for 37 years and
supports Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's bid for
re-election. But he will split the ticket at the top and believes
his son would have done the same.
   ``I would say that if Eddie were alive today, he would support
the views taken by Vice President Bush as opposed to Michael
Dukakis,'' he said.
   Nonetheless, he conceded that his son's political views were not
fully formed. After all, he said, ``He was only 22 years old.''

<HEAD>Leaflet Tactics Range From The Pig-Headed To The Just Plain Mean</HEAD>

   The picture shows a grinning George Bush
wearing a hat that looks like a pig's head, and alongside the
headline reads: ``Would you want your sister to date this guy?''
   The picture and headline are on a flier prepared for the Michigan
AFL-CIO. The leaflet is part of the quiet and sometimes vicious
trench warfare going on in the states outside the control of the
campaigns and the national parties.
   A fund-raising letter asks Republicans in North Dakota, where 96
percent of the population is white, to imagine life in 1989 with
Jesse Jackson as secretary of state.
   In Michigan, a flier titled ``Democratic Leaders-Republican
Lies'' being distributed by the state Democratic Party shows three
photographs of Bush's ``friends:'' Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini,
Panama's Manuel Noriega _ and Republican vice presidential candidate
Dan Quayle.
   Michigan Democratic Chairman Richard Weiner said the flier was
produced because of Republican attacks on Democratic presidential
nominee Michael Dukakis over the Massachusetts prison furlough
program.
   ``We are handing it out in large quantities,'' Weiner said of the
flier, which was supposed to raise questions about Bush's judgment.
   ``I think any reasonable person who reads that knows what the
point of this article is,'' he said.
   North Dakota GOP Chairman Layton Freborg said that he raised the
hypothetical image of a ``Secretary of State Jackson'' to draw
attention to him as a liberal, not to appeal to racial prejudice.
   ``We did not pick Jackson because he was black,'' Freborg said.
``We picked Jackson because of his liberal philosophy, and we didn't
think that would wash too well in North Dakota.''
   Under federal election law, the state parties can spend unlimited
sums of money on fliers, mailings by volunteers, buttons and other
such traditional tools of the trade.
   And then there are the mailings by special interest groups, such
as labor unions, anti-abortion organizations and others who support
one presidential candidate or another but are not formally
affiliated with a campaign or political party.
   The scope of the effort is difficult of gauge because there are
so many groups in so many different places. Democratic and
Republican officials can say little more than that it is big.
   The edge belongs to the Republicans because they got into
computerized mailings years before the Democrats.
   ``Through dint of experience, and experience in direct mail is
gathered from being able to spend money on it, the Republicans are
able to basically flick a switch, whereas in a lot of cases the
Democrats are building the machine,'' said Bob Boorstin, deputy
national field director for the Dukakis campaign.
   ``I assume it's much bigger because it's a presidential election
year,'' said John Grotta, deputy director of Victory '88, the
Republican National Committee's program to help state parties
conduct such efforts. ``We really don't know what is going on out
there.''
   The Dukakis campaign has tried to keep track of the material sent
out on its behalf, but the volume of the task makes it hard to keep
up.
   ``There are hundreds and thousands of pieces of literature
produced during an election year, and we have tried to review
them,'' Boorstin said.
   For the presidential campaigns, much of what is being said for
them and about them in the states is home grown, sometimes
regrettably so.
   In Maryland, a GOP fund-raising letter mailed out several weeks
ago has been repudiated by the Bush campaign and brought calls for
the resignation of state Republican Chairman Daniel Fleming from his
own party's candidates.
   The letter ran a picture of Dukakis and one of Willie Horton, a
convicted murderer who escaped while on a Massachusetts prison
furlough and raped a woman in Maryland. ``Is this your pro-family
team for 1988?'' the letter asked.
   In Illinois, another GOP leaflet, also on the prison furlough
issue, issue, was denounced as ``garbage'' by Democrat Michael
Dukakis and even drew a letter of protest from convicted mass
murderer John Wayne Gacy, who the leaflet said would be eligible for
a weekend pass from prison if he had committed his crimes in
Massachusetts.
   ``I think what happens is you have a lot of local people doing
mailings, and they sometimes step out of line, whether they're a
Jesse Jackson liberal or a Bush conservative,'' said Richard
Viguerie, who helped the Republicans pioneer use of direct mail.

   Sen. Dan Quayle, a staunch foe of abortion,
spoke approvingly of a post-rape medical procedure considered by
many in the field of gynecology as a way to terminate a pregnancy.
   Faced with the hypothetical question of whether he would oppose
abortion for a rape victim, Quayle on Tuesday repeated his
longstanding position that he would allow termination of pregnancy
only to save the mother's life.
   But then Quayle said he would accept a post-rape emergency
medical procedure that he said is aimed at preventing conception
from taking place.
   He was referring to a procedure known as dilation and curettage _
D-and-C _ a scraping and cleaning of the victim's uterine lining.
   Dr. Robert Shesser, an expert in emergency medicine at The George
Washington University Medical Center, said this procedure is not
normally the first-resort option for physicians treating rape
victims.
   ``It is not standard in the immediate post-rape procedure,''
Shesser said, explaining that the D-and-C would likely be used only
if doctors determined that the woman was impregnated by her attacker.
   Quayle refused to acknowledge, under questioning by reporters,
that an abortion in fact would occur if fertilization of an egg by a
sperm cell had taken place by the time the D-and-C procedure was
used.
   Shesser said that doctors far more frequently give rape victims
arriving for treatment a kind of ``morning after'' pill aimed at
chemically destroying the ability of a fertilized egg to grow in the
uterus.
   Speaking of the D-and-C procedure, he said that ``we do not do
that in the immediate post-rape period'' of 36 to 48 hours.
   The Republican vice presidential candidate, who campaigned in
Tennessee and Kenucky, was attending a private GOP breakfast here
today before flying to Greenville, S.C., to appear at a rally and
mix with voters at a drive-in theater. Quayle was to round out the
day with a speech at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater.
   Quayle conceded later Wednesday that the D-and-C procedure
``happens very seldom'' but said no one should question his
opposition to abortion. He said he had voted for a constitutional
amendment to reverse the landmark Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court
decision legalizing abortion and that he had voted against
legislation authorizing the use of federal money to pay for
abortions.
   Of the D-and-C procedure, however, he said that ``I don't
perceive that happening, right after a rape, as being tantamount to
abortion.''
   ``I think it really is nit-picking because of the votes that we
have had'' against abortion, the Republican vice presidential
candidate said. ``You're getting into all sorts of very difficult,
sensitive areas that I don't have all the answers to.''
   Leonard Dinger, a spokesman for the National Right-to-Life
Committee, said he had no problem with Quayle's statements.
   ``Our position is that there are certain medical procedures that
can prevent conception within 24 hours of that (rape) taking
place,'' he said. ``If conception has taken place, and they would be
killing that life, we would oppose it.''
   Quayle said that while he personally opposes abortion except to
spare a mother's life, he accepts that existing federal law permits
a woman to have one.
   Quayle campaigned in Tennesee and a heavily Democratic part of
western Kentucky Wednesday, telling a Republican rally at an
Owensboro airport hangar that he wants conservative-minded Democrats
to ``come home'' to the GOP.
   He also said that the Democratic ticket had tried to distort his
and George Bush's position on gun control, and charged that
Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis doesn't believe in the
constitutional guarantee of a citizen's right to bear arms.

<HEAD>Weicker Strikes Back At Democratic Challenger, But Remains
Deadlocked</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., suddenly
battling for his political life in a race that many thought just
weeks ago would be a walkaway, is flooding Connecticut's airwaves
with a series of ads striking back at his aggressive Democratic
challenger.
   But Weicker's assault _ one he all but promised he would never
launch _ has not yet brought the third-term Republican back to
safety, according to a new poll that shows a virtual deadlock with a
high number still undecided.
   Joseph I. Lieberman, 46, the state's soft-spoken Democratic
attorney general who has matched the incumbent's spending dollar for
dollar, trailed Weicker, 57, by one point _ 38-37 percent _ in a
Hartford Courant poll released Tuesday.
   The survey, which had a margin of error of three percentage
points, mirrored a poll released two weeks ago that showed the
combatants with 39 percent each. That survey transformed the race,
energizing Lieberman and putting Weicker on the defensive.
   The most telling information from the recent poll was the number
of undecided voters _ 25 percent in the last full week of a
well-publicized, statewide campaign. The undecided bloc was less
than half of that at the same point in 1982 in Weicker's race
against Democrat Toby Moffett, then a popular, four-term congressman.
   The Lieberman camp is euphoric over the poll results, which the
Democratic challenger said was ``more than we originally thought
possible.''
   ``For a three-term incumbent, after 18 years, to be in trouble as
deep as he is in a week before the election clearly shows the people
of Connecticut believe it's time for a change,'' said Marla Romash,
issues and communications director for Lieberman.
   But G. Donald Ferree, director of the poll, said the news is not
all cheery for Lieberman.
   ``It's been a loss of support for Weicker rather than a
conversion into the other camp,'' Ferree said.
   Each candidate blames the other's negative TV ads for the large
number of undecided voters. They say the attack ads have distorted
records and positions, confusing voters.
   Media consultant Carter Eskew began creating attack ads for
Lieberman early on, including a series depicting Weicker as a bear
who slept through votes while collecting thousands in speaking fees.
But Weicker, who had a solid double-digit lead in polls through the
summer, said he would resist the temptation to retaliate.
   ``I hope two things happen when the election votes are counted.
No. 1, Lowell Weicker would have won, and No. 2, it will be the
first nail in the coffin of the negative campaign that has become
the vogue in America,'' Weicker said just days before the first poll
showed his big lead had evaporated.
   A week later, he was on the air with his own series of ads
denying Lieberman's charges and attacking the Democrat's state
Senate attendance record and votes on taxes and drug sanctions.
   Weicker campaign manager Jay Malcynsky said the ads are
clarifying the record.
   The media war is the chief contributor to the campaign's
record-setting spending: Weicker plans to spend about $2.8 million
and Lieberman anticipates spending $2.5 million. At that rate, the
campaign will be the costliest in Connecticut political history.
   While the video sniping likely is adding to the confusion, the
candidates' positions on issues _ strikingly similar on many and
seemingly reversed in roles on others _ undoubtedly has added to
voters' hesitation to back a candidate.
   Weicker, known as a maverick who bolts from the GOP rank-and-file
on a range of social and foreign policy issues, has built one of the
most successful political careers in Connecticut history by forging
a delicate base of Republican voters, independents and Democrats
swayed by his leadership role on civil rights and other social
issues.
   This year he has won endorsements from the AFL-CIO, the National
Organization for Women and a state nuclear freeze group.
   Although he has never lost a campaign in his quarter-century
political career, a 3-2 Democratic voter advantage in the state
makes Weicker's re-election bids inherently risky.
   ``You could run a blank face in Connecticut as a Democrat with a
well-funded campaign and it puts the Republican in a position of
having one foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel,''
Malcynsky said.
   Lieberman, in trying to punctuate the differences between himself
and Weicker, has attacked the senator variously from the left and
right, often sounding like the Republican facing a Democratic
incumbent.
   He accuses Weicker of wanting to raise taxes, says he is too
close to Cuban leader Fidel Castro and criticizes his opposition to
a moment of silence in public schools.
   But Lieberman must walk a political tightrope, luring
conservatives while keeping liberal Democrats in line.
   The Lieberman strategy is to hold Democrats, split the
independent vote and capture conservative Republicans such as
National Review Editor William F. Buckley Jr., who would rather have
anybody else _ even a Democrat _ in office.

   Raytheon Co. won a $180 million contract from
the Federal Aviation Administration to install special radar
equipment to detect wind shears at major airports beginning in the
early l990s.
   A wind shear is a sudden change of wind direction that causes a
powerful downburst of air much like water gushing from a faucet. The
air gust is enough to drive a jetliner into the ground when it is
landing or departing.
   The Transportation Department announced the contract Wednesday
and said the ``Doppler'' radar will give air traffic controllers and
pilots a significant safety improvement.
   Powerful wind shears called microbursts have been the cause of at
least five airline accidents that claimed more than 500 lives in the
last 15 years, including the l985 crash of a Delta Air Lines jet
that killed 137 people near Dallas.
   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said no final decision has been made on
where the radars would be installed. Agency officials previously
have said the 47 airports would be those with the highest traffic
levels and a history of wind shear problems.
   The FAA also said it has an option for 55 additional radars at
other airports, costing another $100 million, in the event that it
receives final approval from administration budget planners and
Congress to expand the program.
   ``The terminal Doppler system has a greater potential for
realizing safety gains than perhaps any other individual item of
equipment (in the FAA's air traffic modernization program),'' said
Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley in a statement.
   FAA Administrator Allan McArtor said the introduction of the
radar along the approach and departure paths of major airports is
``a major step'' in providing controllers and pilots with better and
quicker adverse weather warnings.
   Last summer in a 60-day test program at Denver's Stapleton
Airport, a Doppler radar prototype detected 47 strong shears within
five miles of the airport and more than 200 over the entire area of
its coverage, officials said.
   Under the multi-year contract, Raytheon's Equipment Division at
Wayland, Mass., will provide the first terminal Doppler radar to the
FAA's Technical Center in Atlantic City, N.J., in the fall of l991
with the first radar for airport delivery in late l992, the FAA said.
   The FAA has had mechanical wind monitoring equipment at many
major airports for a number of years, but experts have said the
equipment cannot cover along the entire approach and takeoff paths
used by jetliners and, therefore, is of minimal benefit.
   The wind monitors were in use at the Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport when a Delta Air Lines Lockheed L-1011
encountered a powerful microburst during an approach Aug. 2, 1985
causing it to crash and kill 137 people.
   The mechanical monitors also were at the New Orleans airport on
July 9, l982 when a Pan American World Airways jet encountered a
wind shear as it took off. The Boeing 727 crashed, killing 153
people.

   The Soviet Union has bought 250,000 metric tons
of U.S. soybeans for delivery in the 1988-89 marketing year that
began Sept. 1, the Agriculture Department says.
   Although the department provided no further details, the sales _
equal to about 9.18 million bushels _ were the first announced
Soviet purchase of U.S. soybeans for 1988-89 delivery. The Soviet
Union bought more than 830,000 tons of soybeans and 1.3 million tons
of soybean meal in 1987-88.
   Soybean prices at the farm averaged $7.71 per bushel in
mid-October, according to USDA. That would put the farm value of the
latest sale, announced on Wednesday, at about $71 million.

<TEXT>
   Mental illness or substance abuse will affect
almost one in three Americans at some point during their lifetimes,
according to a federal survey of mental health in the United States.
   The survey, released Wednesday by the National Institute of
Mental Health, found that more than 15 percent of those interviewed
in five U.S. cities experienced a mental or substance use problem
during the month prior to the study.
   It also found that mental and emotional disorders were most
common among the younger age groups, and that men were more likely
than women to have substance use and antisocial behavior problems.
   Women, the survey showed, had higher rates for affective
disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and disorders of
somatization, or mental states that are reflected by physical
symptoms.
   Published in the November issue of the Archives of General
Psychiatry, the survey involved interviews with more than 18,500
persons, aged 18 or older. The interviews were conducted in five
cities: New Haven, Conn.; Baltimore; St. Louis, Durham, N.C., and
Los Angeles.
   Each person surveyed was asked if he or she had experienced
symptoms of a mental or substance abuse disorder during the past
month, the past six months, or at any time in life.
   The results showed that 15 percent reported symptoms of a
disorder during the month prior to the survey, and 32.2 percent
reported a disorder at some point in their life. For the six months
prior to the survey, 19.1 percent reported a disorder.
   The most common mental disorders reported were so-called anxiety
and affective disorders. Anxiety would include phobias and panic.
Affective disorders would include depression and manic-depression.
   For anxiety, the one-month rates were 7.3 percent, and for
affective disorders the one-month rate was 5.1 percent.
   Abuse of alcohol and drugs were reported by 6.8 percent of the
group under the age of 45. Severe cognitive impairment, such as
Alzheimer's disease, was more common among the aged, ranging from
2.9 percent for those 65 to 74, up to 15 percent for those over 85.
   Substance abuse was 6.3 percent among men, compared to 1.6
percent among women. The rate for those aged 18 to 24 was highest,
at 6.8 percent, and for men in that age category the rate was 9.3
percent. The rate remained high among men throughout life, not
dropping below 2 percent until after age 65.
   Among women aged 18 to 24, the substance use rate was 4.5
percent, but it dropped dramatically among women after age 25, to
1.1 percent, and continued to fall later in life.
   The report said that the U.S. survey results are similar those
found in other developed nations.

<HEAD>Security Report: Leaky Bucket Should Be Replaced, Not Patched</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department's personnel security
system relies almost entirely on background investigations and does
little on-the-job monitoring after a clearance is issued, according
to a critical review.
   The report by the federally funded Rand Corp. also criticizes the
way the department is using a new research center set up to
investigate more potent defenses against spies.
   Instead of seeking new methods of safeguarding the nation's
secrets, it said, the research center is focusing on improvements to
current procedures. It likened that to producing ``patches ... for a
leaky bucket that gets a new patch with every new espionage case.''
   The Rand report says that what is needed instead is ``a new
bucket.''
   The 84-page study does not offer specific recommendations of its
own for changing the military's approach to document classification,
background checks and employee security.
   But it does attack ``a personnel security program (that) has been
based almost entirely on background investigations for the granting
of clearances.''
   ``On-the-job monitoring and education have been relatively minor
efforts by comparison,'' the study notes. ``Other than
`debriefings,' the program has no provisions for personnel whose
clearances have ended.''
   The Rand Corp., headquartered in Santa Monica, Calif., is a
federally funded think tank that frequently performs special studies
involving security issues for the Defense Department and individual
armed services.
   Its review of the Pentagon's Personnel Security Program,
requested by the deputy under secretary of defense for policy, was
completed in September and just recently published.
   The team of three Rand investigators was asked to review the work
plans at the new Personnel Security Research and Education Center.
The center was established at the Naval Postgraduate School in
Monterey, Calif., in the aftermath of the Walker family spy scandal.
   That scandal, which involved three Navy men from the same family,
has been called one of the most damaging cases of espionage in U.S.
history. The spy ring funneled Navy submarine secrets to the Soviet
Union for about 20 years.
   ``While those who are responsible for personnel security may
reasonably hope that technology and adequate funding will aid them
in the future, the adverse trends are all too apparent,'' the study
said.
   It said those adverse trends include the military's increasing
reliance on computers; legal and societal trends that favor more
litigation and less government secrecy; a change in the motivation
of spies ``from ideology to avarice,'' and a huge increase in the
types of things that must be safeguarded.
   ``The only secrets on a battlefield were once maps and messages,
but even the circuit boards or microchips in a projectile may be
secret today,'' the study noted.

   A proposed merger of two major corporations'
silicone operations likely would harm competition, the Federal Trade
Commission said as it threatened court action to block a joint
venture.
   The federal agency said Wednesday it would seek a court
injunction if General Electric Co. and Union Carbide Corp. decide to
go ahead with the proposed merger.
   GE spokesman Jack Batty did not say what the two companies
planned to do, but he said they had told the FTC they would not
proceed with a joint venture without first notifying the federal
agency.
   ``GE disagrees with the initial decision of the FTC regarding the
proposed joint venture of Union Carbide Silicones and GE
Silicones,'' Batty said. ``We remain committed to working with the
FTC to resolve any existing issues, since we feel the planned merger
is good for both companies and for U.S. industry.''
   A Union Carbide spokesman was unavailable for comment Wednesday
evening.
   The proposed joint venture ``is likely to diminish actual or
potential competition in a number of different product markets,''
the FTC said in a statement.
   The federal commission said it voted 4-0 Tuesday to authorize its
staff to ask a federal district court to grant a preliminary
injunction blocking the venture if the two companies go ahead.
   FTC spokeswoman Anna Holmquist Davis said the commission would go
to court only if it appeared the joint venture would be carried out.
   GE, based in Fairfield, Conn., is the second-largest seller of
silicones worldwide, and it owns silicone-producing plants in New
York and the Netherlands. Union Carbide, based in Danbury, Conn.,
ranks third in U.S. silicone production and sixth worldwide.
   The largest silicone producer is Dow Corning. Silicones are used
in a wide variety of products ranging from Fiberglas to foam and
auto wax.
   GE Silicones spokesman Gregg Bronk said GE and Union Carbide are
strong in different areas of silicone production and thus complement
each other. The two companies plan to share equally in ownership and
management of the joint venture, he said.
   Total sales of all silicone products in the United States were
about $1.1 billion in 1986.

<HEAD>President OKs Medical-Waste Control Bill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Legislation signed by President Reagan directs
the Environmental Protection Agency to draw up a plan to track
infectious medical wastes such as those that washed up on Atlantic
Coast beaches last summer.
   White House officials on Wednesday announced that Reagan had
signed the bill. The president was campaigning for Vice President
George Bush in Wisconsin at the time.
   In a statement, Reagan was quoted as calling the bill ``an
important step forward in the protection of our environment because
it will ensure that those who generate, handle or dispose of medical
waste are accountable, and it will encourage proper handling and
disposal of such potentially dangerous waste.''
   The tracking system for medical waste initially would apply to
only 10 states: Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania,
Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota.
   The program, however, could become national in scope because any
other state could decide to have its medical waste covered by the
plan and gain authority to act against incoming waste not meeting
the tracking requirements.
   Congress acted after waves of used syringes, vials of
AIDS-infected blood and other hospital waste washed up on beaches
along the East Coast, Lake Michigan and Lake Erie during the summer.
The waste became a health problem, closing some beaches because of
the threat of hepatitis and other diseases.
   The new law requires EPA to set up a system to track dangerous
waste from hospitals, labs and clinics to its disposal.
   Blood, hypodermic needles, scalpels and surgical and laboratory
waste that had been in contact with infectious agents all would have
to be tracked. The materials would have to be segregated from other
medical waste and documented to make sure they reached a proper
disposal facility.
   Lawmakers had accused EPA of failing to use its regulatory
authority to resolve the problem.
   In 1978, the agency announced plans to regulate medical waste,
but six years later it said it lacked evidence that the wastes were
causing enough harm to justify regulations.
   Instead, EPA released a package of advice to hospitals on
handling and disposal. Since then, the agency has formed a task
force to re-examine the issue.

   A franchise operator of Wendy's fast food
restaurants is the first company to admit violating a 1986 law
against hiring illegal aliens, officials say.
   U.S. District Court Judge Claude M. Hilton on Wednesday fined
DavCo Food Inc. of Crofton, Md., $60,000 plus $100 in special
assessments. DavCo is the Wendy's franchise operator in the
Washington-Baltimore area.
   As part of its guilty plea, the company agreed to bring its
employment practices into compliance with the Immigration Reform and
Control Act of 1986, federal officials said.
   Ronald Kirstien, DavCo president, said he was glad to have the
issue settled.
   ``It dragged on too long for us,'' he said. ``We cooperated fully
with the investigation. They (federal officials) will even help us
in replacing these employees.''
   William J. Carroll, district director for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said the investigation began in May when an
agent went to a Wendy's restaurant in Vienna, Va., in response to a
citizen complaint that illegal aliens were employed.
   Agents initially were refused permission to talk to the workers,
Carroll said. A search warrant was obtained and the agents arrested
13 illegal aliens, Carroll said.
   Four more illegal aliens were arrested at another DavCo-operated
restaurant in Arlington, Va., in June, Carroll said.
   A Justice Department statement said it was the first guilty
pleading under the new law.
   Maximum penalties against employers include a $3,000 fine per
illegal alien and six months in prison.
   U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson said his office has placed an
increased emphasis on the prosecution of immigration violations.

   Harold Bates celebrated his first 20 years of
almost daily picketing at the state capitol by showing off a
collection of his signs and cutting a cake.
   ``He stands for everything that is right before God Almighty
without compromise,'' Bates said in a news release announcing
Wednesday's celebration.
   ``For Truth, Justice & The Bible,'' the cake proclaimed.
   Only a couple of people attended the affair.
   Bates' targets have included churches, schools, politicians and
movies.
   He says he has picketed in five states, worn out ``probably 20 to
30 pairs of shoes'' and carried thousands of signs and cartoons.
   The 64-year-old retiree estimates he averages 30 hours of
picketing a week _ 31,200 hours, or nearly four years out of the
last 20.
   He's been so busy, in fact, that Wednesday's celebration was
actually a month late.
   Bates said his picketing at the capitol began Oct. 1, 1968, after
officials refused to let him withdraw his children in protest over
the teaching of evolution.
   Although he had belonged to the Church of the Nazarenes for 32
years, he soon split with them as well over ``what I thought was
favoritism to evolution'' and began to picket churches and other
sites.
   His only two arrests were on the church's property, he added.
   To date, Bates estimates, he has stood with more than 2,700
28-by-44-inch picket signs, 1,000 smaller signs and 500 full-color
cartoon boards.
   Dozens were on display Wednesday, and he keeps others at his home.
   The signs are dense with words, some supporting former Gov. Evan
Mecham, others attacking such diverse targets as Jesuits, abortion
and the movie ``The Last Temptation of Christ.''
   In addition to picketing, Bates has found time to run for office
three times, all of them unsuccessfully.
   ``We would all do well to never take for granted our precious and
priceless freedoms, including freedom of speech,'' he said,
undeterred by the long hours when no one stops to talk.

<TEXT>
   The case of a 20-year-old woman who served as a
surrogate mother for her own mother has lifted the veil off a
thriving business of artificial procreation in Italy and spurred
demands for tighter controls on the practice.
   The case, possibly the first of its kind in the world, has also
raised difficult ethical questions and provoked protests from
doctors, politicians and the Vatican.
   And while Italy has no laws governing surrogate motherhood, the
episode has prompted a criminal investigation to determine which of
the two women was registered as the legal mother of the child.
   The affair involves a woman who carried to term the artificially
inseminated egg of her 48-year-old mother. The egg was fertilized by
the sperm of the daughter's 35-year-old stepfather and implanted in
her uterus.
   The arrangement was disclosed in an Oct. 21 program on state-run
RAI television. The two women and the man appeared on the show with
their faces concealed to protect their identities, and their names
have not been revealed.
   The young woman gave birth to a boy at a Rome clinic days after
the program was broadcast, newspapers reported.
   Initially, newspapers and some doctors expressed doubts over
whether such an episode occurred. But most became believers when a
Rome gynecologist, Severino Antinori, said he performed the
procedure.
   The mother, who had three children by an earlier marriage,
explained on the program that her new husband wanted to have
children but that she was advised by doctors not to have more babies
because of a uterus condition.
   The couple went to Antinori, who proposed they adopt a child.
But, after consulting among themselves, the family members returned
and proposed the daughter act as surrogate mother.
   The RAI program immediately touched off a debate in medical and
religious circles over the ethical issues, including whether the
woman who gave birth is the child's mother or sister.
   ``By his act, Antinori has shattered the meaning of the words
father, mother, child and even grandchild,'' said Eolo Parodi,
president of the Italian Doctors' Federation.
   On Oct. 29, the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano denounced
the case in a front-page editorial.
   ``The young woman was painfully used as an object,'' the paper
said. ``She was used for nine months as an incubator, a prisoner of
the egotism of the mother and of the detestable techniques.''
   The gynecologist defended himself and the family.
   ``The uterus was not rented, but only donated, like a kidney, for
free,'' Antinori, 43, told Italian newspapers. ``Genetically, the
situation is very clear: the ovule is that of the mother, the sperm
is that of her husband, and the uterus is that of the daughter who
agreed to lend it.''
   ``It's time for civil society to face up to the problems raised
by the new biotechnologies without hypocritically burying one's head
in the sand,'' he said.
   The case raised the question of who is the child's legal mother.
According to Italian law, the woman who gives birth must be
registered as mother, but the older woman said on the program she
planned to declare herself the mother.
   A state prosecutor has opened an investigation to determine
whether the law was violated, a crime punishable by five to 15 years
imprisonment.
   In the United States, a landmark February ruling by the New
Jersey Supreme Court in the so-called Baby M case outlawed surrogate
motherhood for pay.
   The court granted custody of a child born under contract to the
natural father, but restored parental rights to the mother. A lower
court later granted the mother, Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould, gradually
expanded, unsupervised visitation with the child.
   The outcry over the Italian case has led to the first widespread
public examination in the country of artificial procreation,
including the more ordinary techniques that have been growing in
popularity in recent years.
   Luigi La Ratta, president of the Italian Association for
Demographic Education, a non-profit organization that deals with
family planning issues, said there are 50 public and private sperm
banks in Italy today.
   La Ratta said 15,000 to 20,000 Italian women visit his
association's clinics each year with sterility problems.
   ``We have gone from sperm banks, which by now no one even blinks
an eye at, to egg transplants, to test-tube babies and now to the
surrogate mother-sister,'' La Ratta said.
   Health Minister Carlo Donat-Cattin said he has asked the
ministry's bioethics commission to devise recommendations for
regulating artificial procreation.

   Roscoe Orman, who plays the father figure
``Gordon'' on ``Sesame Street,'' has been ordered by a judge to pay
support for a child he fathered out of wedlock, a lawyer said.
   Orman, 42, of New Jersey appeared last week before Superior Court
Judge Conrad Krafte, who ordered the actor to repay $5,000 for
welfare support the child received in Oregon, where she lives, said
Mitchell Steinhart, a lawyer for the Bergen County Board of Social
Services.
   A judge had told Orman in April to pay $200 a month in child
support after blood tests confirmed he was the father of the girl,
Steinhart said.
   Orman's lawyer, Barry Zotkow, described him as a devoted family
man who had ``a moment of indiscretion'' three years ago. He said
his client arranged last spring to pay the support, and he blamed
computer problems for the delayed payments.
   The girl's mother was a masseuse at a licensed massage parlor and
met Orman in 1985 after he requested a massage during a promotional
tour for the popular PBS show, Zotkow said.

   Actor Burt Reynolds plans to do a good deed
for Palm Beach County, where he grew up, by setting episodes of a
new series here in a move that could boost the local economy.
   Reynolds, who lives in this Palm Beach County resort town, plans
to return to prime-time television in ``B.L. Stryker,'' a series of
six two-hour episodes.
   Reynolds plays a Vietnam veteran and retired New Orleans vice cop
who returns to his home in West Palm Beach. He and Tom Selleck, of
the old ``Magnum, P.I.'' series, are the executive producers.
   With each of the episodes budgeted at $4 million, the county
economy could get a hefty infusion during the next six months.
   ``We hope to leave a lot of that (the series' budget) here,'' he
said Tuesday. ``There are an enormous amount of vehicles that we
have to lease, there's always greenery you have to get, there's
furniture you have to rent. ... The list goes on and on.''

   Mehta, 52, who is also music director of the Israel Philharmonic,
announced his decision Wednesday to the 106-member orchestra after
pondering his contract renewal for several months.
   Stephen Stamas, president of the orchestra corporation, said he
regretted Mehta's decision. ``The search for a successor will begin
shortly,'' he said.

   Through a haze generated by a smoke machine,
Michael Douglas marched down the old marble halls of a government
office building in his first film role since winning the Academy
Award for best actor.
   In ``Black Rain,'' an international thriller that Paramount
Pictures began filming here Monday, Douglas plays a tough New York
City cop who's supposed to deliver a Japanese killer to police in
Japan. But the killer escapes at Osaka Airport, and Douglas must
find him.
   Douglas, who won his Oscar for his portrayal of a slimy power
baron in ``Wall Street,'' told reporters that movies are ``an
international language'' and he hoped the film will deepen ties
between the United States and Japan.

   A minor fire was extinguished by automatic
sprinklers in the hotel room of rock star George Michael, but the
singer apparently wasn't there at the time, authorities said.
   The fire broke out in the bathroom of the 15th floor room at the
Pensacola Hilton early Tuesday, about four hours after Michael
finished a concert across the street at the Pensacola Civic Center,
said Fire Capt. Barney Beasley.
   He said it was unclear what caused the fire and that no damage

   Actress Cheryl Hartley is quitting the nude
Broadway musical ``Oh! Calcutta!'' next week after her
record-breaking 5,000th performance in the show.
   ``When I signed my first contract 11{ years ago for `Oh!
Calcutta!' it was for one year. I was hoping I would finish the
year. I never dreamt I would go on to be in a Broadway show more
than anyone else,'' Ms. Hartley said in a statement Wednesday.
   She is leaving to write and appear in a one-woman show as well as
to undertake other projects, according to her publicist.
   In addition to the Broadway performances of the musical, she has
appeared in ``Oh! Calcutta!'' in Israel, Norway, Argentina, Denmark,

   Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka was
described in good spirits at a hospital after suffering a mild heart
attack following his daily workout at the football team's training
camp.
   The 49-year-old Ditka was in serious but stable condition
Wednesday in the intensive care unit of Lake Forest Hospital, said
Dr. Jay Alexander, a staff cardiologist.
   Alexander said he expected Ditka would recover completely,
``barring anything unforseen.'' But he said he may not allow Dikta _
known for his type A personality and sidelines temper tantrums _
watch the TV broadcast of his National Football League team's game
Sunday against Tampa.
   But that was the most serious change Alexander proposed.
   ``He may want to make some adjustments in his stress levels and a
few other things, but I certainly wouldn't advocate that he find
another job,'' Alexander said.
   Ditka, who was given medicine for a blocked artery, would require
hospitalization for at least a week, Alexander said.

<HEAD>Foreman Of Jury That Convicted Man Of Murder Is Man's Retrial
Lawyer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The attorney representing a man in his third
capital murder trial brings unique insight to the case _ he was the
foreman of the jury that convicted the man and sentenced him to
death nearly 10 years ago.
   ``At first blush, I said he can't do that,'' attorney Wes Hocker
said after State District Judge Woody Densen appointed him Tuesday
as attorney for John Charles Zimmerman.
   ``But after I thought about it and asked some legal scholars
about it, I found I really don't have a conflict of interest,''
Hocker said. ``I've never heard of such a thing, but there's no
impropriety.''
   Hocker served as jury foreman in Zimmerman's second trial for the
kidnapping, rape and fatal stabbing of his 10-year-old niece. The
verdicts in the first and second trials were overturned.
   Zimmerman, 41, had written a letter asking the court to name
Hocker to represent him.
   ``A defense attorney's function is to protect every one of his
client's rights regardless of guilt or innocence,'' Hocker said.
``It's not the judge's or the lawyers' place to judge. It's the
jury's.''
   Hocker said Zimmerman approached him through his law partner,
Robert Morrow, who worked with one of Zimmerman's attorneys in the
1979 retrial.
   During that trial, prosecutors presented letters Zimmerman wrote
to his wife, Sherry, in July 1977 while he was held on charges of
killing Ramona Ann Abner of Jacinto City on March 24, 1977.
   Zimmerman's mother-in-law found the letters, in which he
described committing the crime, and secretly sent them to the slain
girl's mother, who gave them to investigators.
   In April, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals threw out
Zimmerman's conviction and ordered a new trial, ruling that the
letters were confidential communication between husband and wife and
should not have been admitted as evidence.
   Hocker said his role as a juror may give him an advantage in
defending Zimmerman in the trial, which is scheduled to begin next
year.
   ``I've sat in judgment of him with 11 others,'' the attorney
said. ``Maybe I can find some insight into what the jurors are
thinking. I've heard what they thought while back there
(deliberating). I'll have that little something.''

   Theft is so rampant at state enterprises in
Cuba that ``1 million police'' couldn't stop it, according to a
secret documentary produced by Cuban security forces for the island
nation's leaders.
   Copies of the crime documentary and another on the alienation of
Cuba's young people were smuggled out of the island by a defector.
   A screening of the two documentaries, produced by the National
Revolutionary Police in 1986, was held Tuesday evening under the
sponsorship of Freedom House, a New York-based human rights group.
   The second documentary concludes that many of Cuba's young people
are alienated, lack revolutionary fervor and complain that
recreational facilities are often run down, non-existent, off-limits
or inaccessible.
   Freedom House said the tapes were smuggled out of Cuba by Juan
Antonio Rodriguez Manier, a major in Cuban intelligence who defected
to the West in January 1987.
   The extent of crime at state enterprises was such that the
documentary on that issue concluded with an observation by Defense
Minister Raul Castro that ``1 million police'' couldn't resolve the
problem without additional accounting controls.
   President Fidel Castro has publicly acknowledged that crime is a
major problem. The documentary shows Castro saying in a speech that
a ``fierce struggle'' is needed to wipe out crime.
   ``Socialism can't permit this cancer to corrode it, that this
cancer devour it,'' he said.
   The documentaries were intended for viewing by high party and
government officials as a means of dramatizing the magnitude of
criminal activity and how efforts to inculcate Cuban youth with
revolutionary values have fallen short.
   The documentary on crime showed repeated instances of how
employees at state enterprises were able to take advantage of lax
accounting to steal cash or goods.
   Most of the testimony was provided by convicted criminals but
there was no indication of how they were caught. One convict spoke
of how he was able to make off with 224 cases of coffee worth 67,200
pesos. Under Cuba's exchange rate, the peso is worth slightly more
than a dollar.
   Another witness said he was able to pocket about 100 pesos a day
in daily receipts from the enterprise where he worked. He kept up
the activity for three years.
   Yet another said he was able to steal fabric for women's clothes
and leather for shoes in a gambit that appeared to require little
planning or imagination. A security guard was posted at the
warehouse where the goods were kept but he was deaf, the convict
said.
   Several Cubans responsible for taking daily cash proceeds from
their respective enterprises to banks for deposit said they
routinely undertook the trips alone, either on foot or by bus,
without protection.
   In the second documentary, Cuban youths complained to
interviewers that the best beaches often are reserved for tourists
and that transportation to the seashore is difficult because of a
shortage of buses. Cuba's television fare was described as
``garbage'' and there were scenes of a Havana amusement park which
was in a state of almost total disrepair.
   ``Who is the president of Cuba?'' one young man was asked.
   A perplexed look crossed his face. ``Armando Dorticos, no?'' he
answers, not realizing that Dorticos was a former president, that
his first name was Osvaldo and that he died several years ago.
Castro is the current president.

   A ``good Samaritan'' who shot two muggers,
killing one of them, as they beat and robbed a screaming woman on a
Brooklyn street was arrested hours later Wednesday on a weapons
charge, police said.
   Clovis Fearon, 31, who was praised by friends and neighbors
throughout the day for rescuing 43-year-old Gertrude George from her
attackers, initially gave his name as Anthony Dixon. After he was
identified at his late-night arraignment on a gun charge, police
discovered he was a convicted drug dealer. Fearon pleaded guilty in
February 1987 to third-degree criminal sale of a controlled
substance, punishable by up to seven years in prison, said Assistant
District Attorney Starlet Jones.
   He failed to appear for his sentencing and an arrest warrant was
issued in March 1987, the prosecutor said.
   At his arraignment Wednesday before Criminal Court Judge Joseph
Silverman, Fearon pleaded innocent to a felony charge of criminal
possession of a weapon, and bail was set at $500. But he remained
held on the 1987 warrant.
   The gun charge carries a prison sentence of up to seven years,
authorities said.
   Fearon stepped in to help Ms. George when he heard her screams
from his apartment, police said.
   ``His actions, of course, were not criminal in any way in my mind
_ except for the possession of the gun,'' police Inspector Edward
Cappello said before Fearon's record was known.
   One of the two men shot by Fearon was arrested for robbery,
assault and criminal possession of stolen property; the other was
found dead a block away clutching the woman's jewelry in his hand,
said Cappello.
   Both suspects had arrest records; the man who died had three
robbery charges, authorities said.
   Fearon was inside his apartment at about 1 a.m. when he heard a
commotion outside and saw two men attacking Ms. George, who lived on
the same street, Cappello said. Ms. George was assaulted as she
returned home from her shift as a nurse at St. Clare's Hospital, one
of two jobs she holds, police said.
   Fearon, a chef at a restaurant, came out of his house with an
unlicensed .38-caliber handgun and fired three shots, hitting each
man once in the back as they stood over Ms. George, said Cappello.
   ``I was just screaming, `Don't kill me,' because I thought that
was what they were going to do, kill me,'' Ms. George told
reporters. ``At one point I thought I was going to die.''
   She described Fearon, whom she had never met before, as a
``decent young man'' and ``a good citizen.''
   ``He's the only one after I was being robbed and choked ... he
was the only one who came to my assistance,'' she said. ``I don't
think he shot him to kill him, but unfortunately the shot was
fatal.''
   She said it was difficult to feel bad for her attackers.
   ``It could have been me dead,'' Ms. George said. ``The guy that
died showed me no mercy. He was very, very rough. He jumped me from
the back. He squeezed me by the throat, burst the chain off my neck
while the other man was searching my pockets.''
   Cappello identified the dead man as Raymond Plowden, 25. Ms.
George's watch and gold chain were found in Plowden's hand, the
inspector said. Timothy Lewis, 25, was arrested shortly afterward
when he went to a hospital for treatment of his gunshot wound.
   Although a police spokesman initially characterized Fearon as ``a
good Samaritan,'' Cappello, before learning of his criminal record,
refused to call him a hero: ``I don't want to characterize him in
any way.''
   Cappello said Fearon, whose car was recently burglarized,
complained to police at the scene about crime in the Flatbush
neighborhood.
   Ms. George was cut and bruised on her face but did not require
medical treatment, authorities said.

   Gunmen on Thursday stormed the
presidential palace in Male, capital of the Indian Ocean archipelago
nation of Maldives, according to reports reaching Sri Lanka. The
president was reported captured.
   United News of India said President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, 50, who
was re-elected to a third five-year term in September, was seized
along with two of his senior Cabinet ministers.
   The news agency attributed its report to Maldivian residents in
Colombo who had been in touch with friends and relatives in Male.
UNI quoted them as saying about 20 Tamil-speaking men wearing
military uniforms attacked the palace at 4:30 a.m. and gunfire was
heard.
   That the attackers spoke Tamil was an indication they were not
Maldivians.
   Tamil is the language of ethnic minority groups in Sri Lanka and
India. The Maldivians, who are mostly Moslem, speak Divehi, which is
akin to the Sinhalese language of Sri Lanka's ethnic majority.
   Maldives, 400 miles southwest of Sri Lanka and India, consists of
1,200 low-lying coral islands, only 200 of which are inhabited by
the estimated 190,000 people.
   A senior Sri Lankan government official said a resident of the
Maldives telephoned him from Male and gave him the news of an
assault on the palace. The official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, did not identify his informant and gave few details.
   Officials at the Maldivian High Commission in Colombo, also
speaking on condition of anonymity, said they had heard the same
report but had not been able to reach their capital by telephone to
confirm it.
   The Sri Lankan government official quoted his informant as saying
the attackers spoke Tamil.
   Gayoom was scheduled to visit New Delhi this week, but his trip
was canceled without explanation.
   In New Delhi, a spokesman for India's Foreign Affairs Ministry
said he also had heard reports of an assault on the presidential
palace in Male but could not confirm them.
   The spokesman, who commented on condition of anonymity, said
Gayoom had been scheduled to arrive in New Delhi two days ago but
the trip was canceled late last week. He said no explanation was
given.
   The Maldivian diplomats in Colombo said they were aware of some
unrest in their homeland, but they gave no details.
   Maldives was under British protection from 1887 until
independence in 1965. The island chain, twice the size in area of
the state of Washington, is hot, humid and affected by seasonal
monsoons. Its economy depends mostly on tourism and shipping.

   An obscure nationalist group has
claimed responsibility for a bombing that damaged a General Electric
Co. office, saying it was protesting ``Yankee corporations that
contaminate'' Puerto Rico's environment.
   Police said a homemade bomb exploded early Tuesday outside the GE
building in downtown San Juan. No one was hurt.
   The group called a news agency Wednesday, telling them where to
find a communique claiming responsibility.
   The organization calls itself the Pedro Albizu Campos
Revolutionary Forces, named after a Puerto Rican nationalist of the
1930s.
   FBI spokeswoman Alina Bloom said, ``There is such a group known
to the island.''
   She said the bureau was ``still in the process of investigating
the bombing, but not necessarily in regard to this group.''

   Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis held a slim lead over Republican George Bush in New York in
a new poll published today.
   The Buffalo News statewide poll showed Dukakis with a 48-44
percent advantage in New York, which ranks second in the country
with 36 Electoral College votes.
   The newspaper's poll had Dukakis leading by 49 percent to 40
percent three weeks ago.
   The latest survey of 806 registered voters was conducted last
Friday and Saturday and had a margin of error of plus or minus four
percentage points.
   ``New York could go either way on Election Day,'' the
Washington-based Political Media Research Inc. said in a statement
accompanying the poll.
   ``Since September, Bush has cut Dukakis' lead by more than
half,'' the poll analysts said. ``The Empire State has long been
considered a strong one for Dukakis, but he has failed to build on
the lead he enjoyed earlier this year.''

   A Soho loft was the scene of a historic moment in
Soviet art this week when Mihail Chemiakin was invited to be the
first emigre visual artist to return to his homeland for an
exhibition devoted solely to his work.
   When he returns to the Soviet Union in March for his first visit
since being exiled in 1971, Chemiakin will join the ranks of dancer
Mikhail Baryshnikov and pianist Vladimir Horowitz, other emigres
invited back to share their talent with their native land.
   Tair Salachov, the first secretary of the Union of Soviet
Artists, arrived without fanfare Tuesday night at Chemiakin's studio
loft, crammed with the art Soviet authorities had once found so
objectionable that the artist was forced to live in an insane asylum
for six months.
   Salachov's visit formalized the union's invitation to Chemiakin,
whose Moscow exhibition has been in the planning stages since June.
The show will open March 24 at the House of Artists, the union's
exhibition space at the Tetyakov Gallery.
   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's policies of glasnost, or
openness, and improved relations with the United States have made it
possible for ``the two cultures to begin interaction,'' the union
leader said.
   Chemiakin was chosen for the historic show, he said, because of
``the extraordinary scope'' of his work and the Soviet art
community's admiration for him.
   Moreover, Salachov added, ``I like his art.''
   The 47-year-old artist says he has ``mixed emotions'' about
returning to Moscow.
   ``I'm not bubbling with enthusiasm,'' Chemiakin said in Russian
as his associate Sarah deKay translated. ``The Russians should have
woken up a long time ago.''
   But, he added, ``If the policies of Gorbachev are going to
continue, I would like to have more substantial contact with
Russians, to restore and fill in the gaps of the art students
there.''
   Chemiakin, dressed in a camouflage jacket and black boots,
escorted Salachov around the loft where he lives and works.
   Everywhere are examples of his insatiable creative energy _
illustrations he did for Dostoevsky's ``Crime and Punishment,''
authentic African masks that inspired the colorfully grotesque
characters of his ``Carnival in St. Petersburg'' series, and
sculptures of skulls that he designed and a fellow emigre artist
executed. His paintings, which defy categorization, sell for up to
$125,000.
   Skulls are a recurrent theme in Chemiakin's art. He currently is
working on a triptych about the Holocaust: Each panel shows a dark
skull with the name of a concentration camp _ Dachau, Buchenwald and
Auschwitz _ emblazoned in red.
   ``I grew up amid skulls,'' Chemiakin explained.
   His father was a colonel in the Soviet army and after World War
II was appointed commandant of the country's occupation forces in
Konigsberg, the capital of East Prussia that today is the Soviet
city Kaliningrad.
   ``Roaming with my young friends through destroyed Konigsberg, I
would often come across half-mummified bodies. Naturally these
images stayed with me,'' the artist wrote in a two volume book on
his oeuvre entitled ``Chemiakin.''
   In 1957, Chemiakin and his family moved to Leningrad, where he
entered an art school for gifted children. His difficulties with the
authorities began almost immediately; he was expelled from school.
   But he continued his artistic education on his own, copying the
works of French and Dutch masters during his spare time as a mover
at the Hermitage Museum. Soon, he grew restless with the dogmas of
Socialist Realism and began to experiment with new ways of depicting
Soviet life.
   His work was labeled ``an ideological diversion'' by Soviet
authorities, Chemiakin said, and his ``exhibitions were closed down
and often the works were confiscated.''
   ``We were labeled psychologically abnormal people and so attempts
were made to either hide us away in insane asylums _ which happened
to me and which happened also to many of my friends _ or they tried
to send us off even further away.''
   Chemiakin was exiled from the Soviet Union in 1971. He lived in
Paris until 1981, when he came to New York. He currently is seeking
American citizenship.
   Salachov, an artist who has held government appointed positions
in the art field since 1968, was philosophical about past Soviet
intolerance for Chemiakin's art and his treatment by authorities.
   ``It was a different time,'' he said.
   The goal today ``is to support everything that has talent,
because there are people on the right and people on the left. But
everything that is truly talented as a new step we will support,''
Salachov said through an interpreter.
   Chemiakin is critical of the United States, where he says the art
scene is controlled by big money. But he says he doesn't consider
returning to his homeland to live.
   ``I'm glad I've found a second country. And I'm glad that on my
poster for this exhibition that I will be identified as an American
artist.''

   Police say they have broken up a theft ring
that allegedly dealt in more than $11,000 worth of cow gallstones
stolen since July at a meat packing plant.
   The gallstones, which are considered in the Orient an
aphrodisiac, are the most expensive part of a cow, selling for more
than $600 an ounce.
   Mike Sherman, president of the Cornhusker Packing Co., said
Wednesday that the company sells the gallstones to a Japanese export
firm. In a two-month period earlier this year the company sold 19
ounces for $13,000, Sherman said.
   Police on Wednesday charged four Omaha men with receiving stolen
property valued at more than $1,000. A fifth Omaha man was charged
Tuesday with theft by taking property valued at $300 to $1,000.
   Sgt. Charles Prokupek said four of the men are employees of
Cornhusker Packing. The fifth is a local representative of Hyclone
Laboratories, an Ogden, Utah, company that buys fetal calf blood
from the packing plant, Sherman said.
   Sherman said the gallstones usually are collected by employees
who work on the plant's kill floor and are supposed to be turned in
at the office. The gallstones _ ranging in size from the tip of a
pencil to an egg _ are sold to Japanese Export Co. of Minneapolis,
he said.

   Next year, residents of this rural community
dotted with ranches will be able to saddle up Trigger, trot past
hitching posts and then order a Big Mac to go at a drive-through
window.
   Bowing to popular demand, McDonald's will level its fast-food
restaurant and replace it next May with a $1 million wood-and-brick
outlet resembling a saloon.
   Franchise owner Mickey Maros said he was inspired to renovate the
restaurant after increasing numbers of customers on horseback began
showing up at his drive-through window.
   ``It sounds funny in 1988 to say that,'' Maros said. ``People
think of south Florida as being so urban. Davie is so rural.''
   After beating sand off their chaps, Davie cowboys will be able to
water their horses in a corral out back, which will offer salt
licks, hay and troughs of water.
   Maros said he hopes the new restaurant will draw more horseback
customers by making them feel at home. But the newcomers may fuel
demand for a different type of gadget for the restaurant's cleanup
crew.
   ``I hope we have a need to buy more pooper-scoopers,'' Maros said.

be off to see the wizard next year when she stars as Dorothy during
Hollywood's 50th anniversary celebration of ``The Wizard of Oz.''
   ``I'm going to meet all kinds of neat people,'' said the
second-grader.
   She was chosen for the role while in Los Angeles last month
appearing on the television game show ``Card Sharks.'' The
television appearance was part of the $10,000 in prizes she won in
September in the Miss Junior America Petite pageant in Orlando, Fla.
   ``I'm looking forward to meeting Liza Minnelli especially. Gosh,
yes, I'll love that,'' Morgan said.
   Miss Minnelli is the daughter of the late Judy Garland, who
starred in the in 1939 movie.
   The rights to the movie belong to the Turner Broadcasting Co.,
which is planning next year's golden anniversary celebration.
   Like Miss Garland, Morgan will sing as part of her role. She also
will spend a month next summer studying acting as part of the
``career development'' program at Universal Studios.
   ``She has known that this _ being an actress _ was something that
she's wanted to do since she was a baby,'' said her mother, Kelli
Matlock. ``My husband and I didn't know what else to do but just go
with the flow.''
   Morgan said she is quite familiar with the tale of ``The Wizard
of Oz.''
   ``Oh, yes. I have the movie,'' she said. ``Since I'm going to be
in the celebration, I watch it every chance I get.''

   Fighting back tears, a mother pleaded
publicly to an unknown kidnapper to return her premature infant, as
authorities warned that the baby's life may be in danger and offered
a $13,000 reward for his return.
   About two dozen detectives were working against time today to
find the woman who posed as a nurse as she kidnapped Christopher
Michael Jones from his mother's room at Doctors Hospital. Doctors
said Wednesday a lack of proper medical care would endanger the
6-day-old boy's life.
   ``The baby's blood sugar can get very low and we were watching it
carefully in the hospital. If it gets too low it can cause seizures
or even death within a relatively short period of time,'' said Dr.
Whit Hall.
   The baby, born Saturday, weighed 4 pounds and must be fed every
three hours and kept warm because he is small, Hall said.
   Christopher's mother, Annette Jones-Thomas, 32, was ushered into
a news conference in a wheelchair Wednesday with her husband, Willie
Jones, 39, at her side, and delivered an emotional plea to her
baby's kidnapper.
   ``Please, if you have my child, please return him,'' she said,
fighting back tears as her hands fiddled nervously with a sheet of
paper from which she haltingly read her statement.
   ``He needs medical attention and if you have him for the reason
of taking his as your child and raising him and loving him, do what
a good mother would do. Bring him to the hospital and let him get
help.''
   Mrs. Jones-Thomas, a secretary for the Arkansas Education
Association, and her husband have two daughters, ages 8 and 5. The
younger girl has cerebral palsy, according to co-workers and a
neighbor.
   The mother said a young black woman dressed in a white pleated
skirt and a white sweater entered her four-floor room Tuesday night
and said she needed to weigh the baby. The child hasn't been seen
since.
   Mrs. Jones-Thomas said she did not know the woman who took the
baby, who has black straight hair and a growth on his right ear.
   A hospital nurse came into the room about 30 minutes later to
take the baby to the nursery and discovered him missing, officials
said. Police searched the area with dogs but found nothing, said
Sgt. Larry Dunnington.
   The kidnapper was not wearing a nurse's identification tag, said
hospital spokeswoman Jessica Szenher. Dunnington said authorities
don't know how the woman entered or left the hospital.
   The kidnapper mostly likely wants either to sell the infant, get
ransom for him or keep him for herself, said police Lt. R.L.
``Bert'' Jenkins.
   Dunnington said he believes the kidnapper is still in the state.
He would not elaborate.
   Geri Frances Vaughters, a hospital technician, said she saw a
woman fitting the description of the woman before the abduction. She
said she saw a black woman wearing a white skirt and a white sweater
in the waiting room of the coronary care unit of the hospital. Ms.
Vaughters said she thought the woman was a visitor.
   Doctors Hospital has offered a $10,000 reward for the return of
the baby; the Little Rock Children's Clinic, a group called
Protecting Arkansas Children Together and the Little Rock Police
Department's Crime Stoppers added another $1,000 apiece.

   Officials of the world's top tobacco-consuming
country have proposed restricting foreign cigarette imports and
limiting the tar content of domestically-produced cigarettes, the
official China Daily said today.
   The proposals, made by the State Tobacco Sales Monopoly Bureau,
were announced in the national legislature this week along with
Ministry of Public Health plans to draft China's first anti-smoking
law, the daily said.
   The daily did not specify the possible scope of the law or when
it might by completed. Some Chinese and foreign doctors estimate
that if strong measures are not taken, 2 million Chinese will die
annually of smoking-related causes by the year 2025.
   According to the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine, China
has 250 million smokers, about a quarter of the population. It says
70 percent of Chinese suffer the ill effects of smoking if passive
smokers are included.

   The Marine Mammal Commission said it would look
into allegations that Navy trainers beat and starved dolphins in a
classified surveillance program, but a Navy spokesman denied the
animals were mistreated.
   ``We don't punish mammals or any of the animals for not
performing tasks, but we reward them (with food) for satisfactory
performance,'' said Lt. Ken Ross, a Navy spokesman at the Pentagon.
``We aim to keep them as healthy as possible because they are very
valuable to us.''
   Ross was responding Wednesday to allegations by dolphin trainer
Rick Trout, who this week told a meeting of marine animal trainers
that he witnessed ``incidences of abuse, weight loss, corporal
punishment and damage to animals after transport.''
   Trainers also use ``very negative methods, including food
deprivation, corporal punishment and other aversive techniques,''
said Trout, a civilian hired to work with the dolphins in San Diego,
where they are trained by the Navy to help detect mines or enemy
frogmen.
   Ross insisted that the program operated out of the Naval Ocean
Systems Center was ``running smoothly,'' but he said an
investigation will be conducted to ensure the animals are being
cared for properly.
   ``Those are allegations we are checking,'' Ross said.``Our
primary concern is the health and safety of the animals, and the
treatment of all our animals is well within the Marine Mammal
Protection Act. We never have and never intend to do anything that
could bring harm to the animals.''
   A veterinarian is always either present or on call during
training, he said, adding that the Navy considered the program's
dolphin mortality rate of 5 percent to be better than the species'
mortality rate in the wild.
   Trout, who no longer works for the Navy, made his comments in an
appearance before the International Marine Animal Trainers
Association meeting in San Antonio, Texas.
   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, citing unidentified sources,
reported Wednesday that four of the Navy's three dozen dolphins have
died during the past 18 months and that an undetermined number of
others were blinded or crippled by abusive handlers.
   John Twiss, executive director of the Washington-based Marine
Mammal Commission, said the Navy's dolphin training center ``met or
exceeded all standards published by the animal and plant health
inspection service of the Department of Agriculture'' in 1986.
   Nevertheless, he said the commission, which advises federal
agencies on the handling of marine mammals, wants to find out if
there is any truth to the allegations.
   ``We'll try to find out what is actually happening. We're
certainly not going to disregard a story like this,'' Twiss said.
   Navy officials said they were aware of two dolphin deaths within
the program in recent months and were checking the reports of
additional deaths.
   One of the dolphins died while on assignment in the Persian Gulf
last year from complications of a bacterial infection. The second
died of unknown causes while on being trained near Indian Island off
Washington state.

<TEXT>
   No buyers have come forward with the $2.8
million asking price for the showplace home of the late Liberace, so
the property will be sold at auction next month.
   About 300 people have expressed interest in the home, said
auctioneer Eric Nelson, standing in a barren living room of the home
that was once the scene of some of this city's swankiest parties.
Prospective buyers included movie stars, hotel-casino owners and
people from Japan, Europe and Africa, he said without providing
names.
   Since none of the prospects met the asking price, the home will
be offered at auction Dec. 10, with proceeds going to the Liberace
Foundation for the Performing Arts, Nelson said. The pianist, who
died Feb. 4, 1987, of complications of AIDS, started the foundation
to provide scholarships for art and music students at some 30
colleges and universities.
   One of the major features of the home is a giant master bedroom
with a painting of the Sistine Chapel frescoes on the ceiling. The
painting, by an Italian artist, took nearly two years to complete.
   Between two bedrooms, at the end of a marble, mirrored hallway,
is a fountain and a sunken bathtub, with a painting of Liberace on
the ceiling.
   Liberace reportedly invested $3 million in the home, creating a
two-story property with 10,549 square feet of living space by
attaching and renovating two houses in a middle-class neighborhood.
   By the time reporters toured the home Wednesday, however, it had
been stripped of millions of dollars in memorabilia and decorations.
Some of that property was sold at auction earlier this year in Los
Angeles and the remainder is on display at the Liberace museum a few
blocks from the home.
   ``There are a lot of fond memories in this place,'' said Dora
Liberace, sister-in-law of the entertainer and head of the museum.
``There were a lot of fun times here.
   ``It bothers me today because you know it's so final.''
   Mrs. Liberace said holiday parties are among her favorite
memories.
   ``Those days were so fun, so light, so happy.''
   The home is located two miles southeast of the Las Vegas Strip
where Liberace arrived as a fledgling entertainer known as ``Walter
Busterkeys'' and stayed to become one of the city's top attractions.

   The Pentagon, considered one of the biggest U.S. offenders in its
reliance on chlorofluorocarbon, or CFCs, said Wednesday it would
support a program aimed at finding and testing alternatives to the
chemical by April 1989.
   The task force is being led by the Environmental Protection

<TEXT>
   Leftist rebels attacked army
positions at a sugar refinery and a bridge, killing six soldiers and
bringing to ten the armed forces death toll in two days of guerrilla
operations.
   Meanwhile, Treasury Police commandos on Wednesday night stormed a
prison where inmates had held three hostages for 45 hours.
Authorities said three prisoners and a hostage were killed in the
raid.
   The guerrilla raids Wednesday followed by hours a rebel mortar
attack on national guard headquarters in San Salvador that left four
dead and 37 wounded.
   Rebels attacked a sugar refinery nine miles north of the capital
before dawn Wednesday, said the head of plant security, who
identified himself only as Sgt. Sandoval.
   ``They attacked us with mortars and rifle fire, but they didn't
destroy the machinery. They damaged the offices, and they killed
four soldiers ... and wounded four others,'' he said.
   About the same time, rebels killed two national guardsmen in a
30-minute attack on a post at a nearby highway bridge, military
sources said.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the
guerrillas were mounting a coincident diplomatic effort in the
region ``to portray themselves as somehow more moderate in their
stance and more powerful than they really are.''
   Redman said the attacks did not alter plans by Secretary of State
George P. Shultz to attend a foreign ministers meeting of the
Organization of American States in San Salvador in mid-November.
   Four soldiers were killed and 37 people, including seven
civilians, were wounded in the national guard attack Tuesday, the
largest rebel strike in the capital since January 1981.
   The national guard is part of El Salvador's armed forces and
participates in counterinsurgency operations.
   About 65,000 people have been killed in the 9-year-old war, the
majority of them civilians.
   The prison assault ended a standoff that began when three inmates
jumped two guards and took their rifles at the prison in
Quezaltepeque, 15 miles north of San Salvador.
   The assailants, along with three other inmates, demanded
political asylum in Mexico in exchange for releasing the hostages, a
nurse and two prison guards.
   Communications Minister Roberto Viera told reporters that about
100 prisoners not involved in the hostage-taking had tried to flee
the prison, which was surrounded by troops.
   The attempted escape provoked the six hostage-takers, who threw a
grenade and began shooting at the troops and fleeing prisoners,
Viera said.
   ``When the rioters began firing, the special forces intervened,''
Viera said.
   Reporters on the scene saw the commandos blow open the doors of
prison cells and toss tear gas grenades inside to force the
prisoners out.
   Viera said three of the six hostage-takers and one of the guards
they had held were killed. The nurse and the other guard were freed
unharmed, while a prisoner not involved in the hostage-taking was
slightly wounded, he said.

<TEXT>
   A lawyer accused a music company executive
of filing a plagiarism suit in revenge against guitarist John
Fogerty, whose 1985 solo album originally included two songs that
the executive says libeled him.
   In a heated session Wednesday before a U.S. District Court jury,
music executive Saul Zaentz called the accusation of retaliation a
lie.
   He said he filed the plagiarism lawsuit against Fogerty after
Doug Clifford, another member of Fogerty's Creedence Clearwater
Revival band, came to him in January 1985 with a copy of Fogerty's
newly released solo album and an earlier Creedence song.
   Fantasy Records, Creedence's label from 1967 to 1972, is suing
Fogerty over ``Old Man Down the Road,'' the lead single on his
comeback ``Centerfield'' album of 1985.
   The lawsuit contends the melody of ``Old Man'' was copied from
``Run Through the Jungle,'' a 1970 Creedence song written by Fogerty
to which Zaentz's Fantasy Records owns the rights. Damages could
reach $2 million based on sales of the single and album.
   Twice in Zaentz's brief testimony, he was accused by Fogerty's
lawyer of filing the copyright suit in revenge against Fogerty for
including one song originally titled ``Zanz Kant Danz'' and one
called ``Mr. Greed'' on the 1985 album.
   Zaentz has filed a $142 million libel suit over the two songs and
public statements by Fogerty. The suit is pending in Los Angeles.
   Fogerty changed the title of the first song to ``Vanz Kant Danz''
and later dropped the song from subsequent pressings of the album.
   Outside court, Malcolm Burnstein, a lawyer for Fantasy Records,
said Clifford and another former Creedence member, Stu Cook, had
been ``a little irritated at John for cutting into their record
royalties by stealing the song.''
   Cook and Clifford still get royalties from continuing sales of
Creedence records, but Fogerty gave up part of those royalties in a
contract agreement, Burnstein said.
   Zaentz, also a successful movie producer, and Fogerty, lead
singer and songwriter for Creedence, have been feuding for more than
a decade over royalties from the group's songs and other financial
and personal matters.

<HEAD>14 Savannah River Workers Exposed To Plutonium</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AIKEN, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fourteen workers at the troubled Savannah
River nuclear weapons plant were exposed to tiny amounts of
plutonium outside buildings, and five went home with the potentially
deadly contaminant on their shoes, officials said.
   The soles of their shoes effectively screened out any harmful
radiation, and none of the workers' homes were found to have
unusually high levels of radiation, plant officials said Wednesday.
   ``Approximately 120 small spots of contamination were found, most
of which were found on the ground,'' said Becky Apter, a spokeswoman
for Du Pont, which operates the plant for the U.S. Department of
Energy.
   The ground contamination in the chemical separations area has
been cleaned up but decontamination was continuing on the roof of
one building, she said.
   However, officials said they did not know how the plutonium got
outside the buildings in the area, or its exact source.
   The plutonium could have come from a building's stack, which
vents the building's air filter system, or from improper handling of
waste material or moving of nuclear material from one building to
another, said Du Pont Health Protection Superintendent Bill Reinig.
   The amount of contamination was small _ about one microcurie.
   ``You could pick up all the spots, you could eat it all and you
would still be less than 10 percent of the federal limit of
plutonium in the body,'' Reinig said.
   Michael Lowe, a spokesman for the environmental watchdog group
Greenpeace, charged that the Oct. 26 incident was just another
indication of poor safety standards at the plant, located across the
Savannah River from Augusta, Ga.
   ``Here's a good example of where normal procedures, which would
be considered arguably safe, would be safe if the DOE was diligent
with safety,'' he said. ``How many operations at Savannah River a
day are performed that have the same institutional problems?''
   The plant is the largest complex in the government's nuclear
weapons production system. Its three reactors were the only ones in
the nation still producing the major nuclear weapons materials,
plutonium and tritium, before they were shut down by DOE in April
for safety reasons.
   Some congressmen have expressed concerns over continuing health
problems at Savannah River and other nuclear weapons plants. Last
month, the Physicians for Social Responsibility called for the
creation of a national medical board to assess the problems.
   At another plant, in Fernald, Ohio, state officials said
Wednesday that more radioactive radium was released into the Great
Miami River from uranium processing than earlier realized,
increasing the potential health threat to nearby residents.
   After the Savannah River's Oct. 26 incident, workers conducted a
survey and detected low levels of plutonium between two buildings,
and on the roof of one of them, said Ms. Apter.
   Reinig said plutonium emits radioactive alpha rays, small amounts
of which can be ``completely shielded by a thin piece of paper.''
   ``The alpha (rays) can be stopped by the soles of the shoes,'' he
said. ``Employees sustained no radiation dose. It doesn't become a
hazard unless it is ingested into the body.''
   He said there was ``no indication whatsoever'' that any of the
material was ingested, and monitoring devices indicate no
contamination was carried off the site in the air or water.
   Ms. Apter said Du Pont investigators checked 200 workers and
found that nine who were on the site at the time had picked up
contamination. They later found five more had picked up
contamination but had gone home before it was detected.
   Their homes were checked, and no radioactivity was found, Ms.
Apter said.
   In Ohio, the new information about the river contamination was in
documents filed by the Department of Energy as part of the defense
the department has prepared for National Lead of Ohio Inc., the
plant's former operator, in a class-action lawsuit.
   ``It's definitely new stuff,'' said Graham Mitchell, a spokesman
for the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.
   Residents of the Fernald community filed the lawsuit in U.S.
District Court in Cincinnati earlier this year, contending the
operator allowed radioactive uranium dust to escape from the plant,
damaging their health and property.

<HEAD>House Of Commons Backs Ban On TV, Radio Interviews With IRA</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government won
House of Commons backing early today for its ban on British
television and radio interviews with the IRA and 10 other militant
groups in Northern Ireland.
   The 650-seat House rejected by 244 votes to 183 an amendment by
the socialist opposition Labor Party seeking to condemn the ban as
``incompatible with a free society.''
   But several members of Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative Party sided
with Labor in criticizing the ban as damaging censorship.
   TV journalists at the British Broadcasting Corp. and commercial
TV companies in London and Wales and journalists at the London
headquarters of the BBC's World Service plan 24-hour strikes to
protest the ban.
   The BBC World Service broadcasts to a worldwide audience of 120
million.
   The ban covers interviews with members and supporters of the
outlawed Irish Republican Army, its legal political wing Sinn Fein
and nine other groups in Northern Ireland, four of them Protestant.
   It applies only to face-to-face interviews and television and
radio reporters remain free to cite the views of the 11 groups,
provided they do so indirectly. The ban does not apply to newspapers
or foreign television and radio services and will not apply during
elections.
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, the Cabinet member responsible for
law and order among other matters, imposed the ban on Oct. 19, using
legal powers he possesses over broadcasting authorities.
   The ban did not require parliamentary approval but Hurd
nevertheless promised a Commons debate on the issue. The debate
began Wednesday night.
   The rejected Labor amendment said the ban was likely to help the
guerrillas ``by providing them with the opportunity to argue that
the government will not allow the wide expression of opinion which
is essential to democratic debate and peaceful change.''
   But Hurd said during the debate: ``Those who live by the bomb and
the gun and those who support them cannot in all circumstances be
accorded the same rights as the rest of the population.''
   He added: ``We shall soon be putting to Parliament new and
stronger measures of this kind, bearing in particular on the funds
of terrorist organizations.''
   He did not elaborate but the government has said it plans to
introduce measures to enable authorities to seize the funds of
guerrilla groups.
   The moves follow an upsurge of IRA attacks this year on British
security forces in Northern Ireland, mainland Britain and
continental Europe.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA wants to end British rule in
predominantly Protestant Northern Ireland and unite the province
with the mainly Catholic Republic of Ireland under socialist rule.
   Protestant militants oppose all talk of unity with the Republic.
   Conservative legislators who criticized the ban in the debate
included Cyril Townsend. He said: ``The government in its haste has
come forward with a measure that is going to damage our party and
damage our country. This is a measure of censorship.''
   Television journalists at the BBC voted Wednesday to join a
one-day strike on Nov. 10 called by the National Union of
Journalists.
   Journalists at commercial television companies in London and
Cardiff in Wales and at the BBC World Service plan similar 24-hour
strikes, but no date has been announced for the stoppages.

   Oliver North, the stoic former Marine,
ignored angry taunts, abusive banners and constant interruptions and
praised the virtues of free speech in an address at Boston College.
   After a month of controversy over his scheduled appearance, North
quipped Wednesday night about his $25,000 honorarium, hinted he
might someday seek public office and claimed he voted for John F.
Kennedy in 1960 _ when he was 17.
   The former National Security Council staffer, indicted for his
role in the Iran-Contra affair, received a minute-long standing
ovation and wild support from a crowd that jeered hecklers and
chanted ``U.S.A., U.S.A., U.S.A.'' as police dragged demonstrators
from a campus gym.
   ``In a previous occupation, I could have gotten combat pay for
this,'' said North, who was protected by a phalanx of police.
   But he stared at his notes when a melee broke out in the crowd
and was even-tempered when a protester yelled ``He's a drug-runner''
and another tossed a placard bearing a swastika and called North a
fascist.
   ``I quite honestly resent the label of fascist,'' North said.
``My father was terribly wounded in the war against the fascists.''
   There were no arrests, but police forcibly evicted six people
from the crowd of about 4,000, who paid $7 each to hear North. Loud,
organized protests and counterprotests preceded the speech at the
normally tranquil Jesuit college.
   ``I welcome the fact that there are those with dissenting views
and I welcome the fact that in this wonderful and blessed country of
ours there is an opportunity to express those views,'' he said.
   ``In many of the countries which claim a great deal of support,
to include Nicaragua, the same power of free speech is not given,''
North said to cheers.
   North, 45, is awaiting trial on 16 counts of conspiracy to
defraud the U.S. government by selling arms to Iran and transferring
the profits to the rebels fighting the overthrow the leftist
Nicaraguan government. He said he has spoken in 30 states during the
last four months to raise money for his defense, estimated to cost
more than $1 million.
   With his voice cracking as it did during the televised
Iran-Contra hearings in the summer of 1987, North, wearing a dark
suit and red tie, quoted Thomas Jefferson, Winston Churchill and
Kennedy _ ``the first president I was blessed to vote for.''
   But North was born Oct. 7, 1943, which would have made him just
17, shy of the voting age, when Kennedy was elected in 1960.
   Taking questions from spectators _ but not reporters _ after his
hourlong speech, North said his goals are ``to finish up this legal
case, pay off the money from that and return at some point to the
service of our country.''
   North's $25,000 speaking fee provoked a storm of controversy.
More than 1,500 people signed petitions against the payment, part of
which came from a mandatory $41-per-student activities fee.

<TEXT>
   James Robinson Shepley, who rose from reporter to
president of Time Inc. and led it through a period of expansion in
which the company launched Money and People magazines, has died. He
was 71.
   Shepley, whose lived in Hartfield, Va., after retiring in 1982
from Time, died Wednesday of complications from cancer. at a clinic
in Houston, Time announced.
   The announcement from Time Inc. described Shepley as a ``brusque
but decisive manager'' who rose to the publishing company's top
executive post despite a lack of formal business training.
   During his tenure as president from 1969 to 1980, the company
started Money and People magazines, revived Life as a monthly after
suspending it as a weekly, bought the Book-of-the-Month Club and the
American Television and Communications Corp. and developed Home Box
Office as the first national pay television service.
   It also acquired Temple Industries and Inland Container, two
forest products companies that were later spun off to Time Inc.'s
shareholders.
   Born in Harrisburg, Pa., Shepley worked at the Harrisburg Daily
Patriot, the Pittsburgh Press and United Press before being hired by
Time magazine in 1942 as a correspondent in the Washington bureau.
   He was a war correspondent in both the Pacific and Europe during
World War II, covering the assault on the Japanese in Burma and the
Battle of the Bulge in Europe.
   He was commissioned an Army captain at the end of the war and was
attached to Chief of Staff George C. Marshall, with whom he
collaborated on the official report of World War II.
   In 1954, Shepley was co-author of ``The Hydrogen Bomb'' with Life
correspondent Clay Blair Jr. In 1956, he interviewed Secretary of
State John Foster Dulles for Life; the story made Page 1 news and
introduced ``brinkmanship'' into the Cold War lexicon.
   As an executive, Shepley rose from assistant publisher of Life to
publisher of Fortune and then of Time magazine before being chosen
president of Time Inc. in 1969.
   After stepping down as president in 1980, he remained on the Time
board as chairman of its executive committee, and also was chairman
and chief executive officer of The Washington Star, which Time Inc.
owned for three years.
   Shepley was a lifelong hunter, fisherman, aircraft pilot and
sailor. He remained active on numerous corporate boards after his
retirement.
   He is survived by his wife, the former Yvonne Hudson; two sons,
six daughters and 15 grandchildren.
   A memorial service will be held at St. Alban's Church in
Washington, D.C., Wednesday.

   Thousands of radical students pelted
riot police with firebombs and rocks today in Seoul and other
cities, and demanded the arrest of former President Chun Doo-hwan on
corruption charges.
   It was the worst political clash in Seoul since major
anti-American protests last summer. Many police officers and
students suffered cuts and other injuries from firebombs and rocks,
but there were no overall figures.
   Police did not say if any protesters were arrested.
   In Seoul, about 3,000 students fought police in four areas near
Chun's house in a fashionable residential suburb. Clashes were also
reported in several provincial cities.
   ``Arrest Chun Doo-hwan. Punish (President) Roh Tae-woo,''
students in Seoul shouted as they hurled firebombs and repeatedly
charged police despite a dense fog of tear gas.
   About 9,000 police were posted along streets and alleyways
leading to Chun's house to repel the protesters. Police used tear
gas whenever students tried to break through their lines.
   Traffic came to a standstill and most shops in the areas were
closed as the fighting persisted for several hours. Many pedestrians
wore gauze masks or put hankerchiefs over their noses to filter out
the acrid tear gas.
   In front of Sogang University at the center of Seoul clashes,
about 700 students, brandishing hundreds of firebombs, repeatedly
charged about 500 riot police who were blocking their march. Police
retaliated with tear gas.
   Firebombs exploded in showers of orange flames near or amidst
columns of police, who deflected the missiles with shields and put
out blazes with hand-carried extinguishers.
   Several blocks away, near the house of opposition leader Kim
Dae-jung, another group of 500 students battled police with rocks
and firebombs. Kim's house is about eight blocks from Chun's.
   In the southern city of Kwangju, about 2,000 students held campus
rallies or took part in street protests to demand Chun be punished
for alleged corruption and human rights violations.
   In Chunchon and Ansung in eastern and central South Korea, dozens
of students also attacked with firebombs a police station and a
government party office. No injuries or major damage was reported.
   News reports said thousands of students had held anti-Chun
rallies on their campuses to prepare for a march on Chun's house.
Fighting erupted at some schools as students tried to march out.
   Anti-government demonstrations have been escalating in recent
weeks as radical students organized ``save-the-nation suicide
squads'' and threatened to raid Chun's house to press for his arrest
and punishment.
   The anti-Chun march was part of anti-government strategies by
radical students, who are also calling for an ouster of President
Roh.
   They argue that hte Roh government is dragging its feet on a
probe of alleged corruption and other scandals involving the
ex-president, his family members and associates.
   Roh and Chun, both former army generals, have been close friends
since they were classmates at Korea Military Academy in the 1950s.
Roh succeeded Chun, who stepped down following protests at the end
of a seven-year term in February.
   Chun has come under public fire for his alleged misuse of power
during his tenure. One of his brothers, Chun Kyong-hwan, has been
sentenced to seven years in prison for taking bribes and embezzling
millions of dollars worth of official funds.
   Former Seoul Mayor Yom Bo-hyon, a close confident of Chun, was
also sentenced to a five-year jail term last month for taking bribes
and illegally helping the business of some family members of the
ex-president.
   Chun is also under investigation for his alleged role in
militarily suppressing a 1980 civil uprising in the southern city of
Kwangju that resulted in the deaths of about 200 people.

<HEAD>U.N. Reports Large Number Of Executions in Iran After Cease-fire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.N. report on human rights in Iran says
``a renewed wave of executions'' occurred about the same time the
country's Islamic fundamentalist government agreed to a cease-fire
with Iraq.
   A copy of the report to the General Assembly, obtained Wednesday,
calls for continued scrutiny of Iran's human rights practices,
citing executions of political dissidents and other reports of
abuses.
   The first secretary of Iran's U.N. Mission, Amir Hossein
Zamaninia, said the mission had seen the report and had no comment.
   U.N. special representative Reynaldo Galindo Pohl of El Salvador
said in his report, ``A large number of prisoners, members of
opposition groups, were executed during the months of July, August
and early September 1988.''
   The cease-fire putting at least a temporary halt to a war that
since 1980 has left at least 1 million dead and injured was signed
Aug. 20 by Iran and Iraq.
   Most of those executed since midsummer were said to be members of
the People's Mujahedeen, an outlawed opposition group, but the
report said about 20 belonged to such other opposition groups as the
Tudeh party, a Marxist organization, and the People's Fedayeen.
   It did not say how many people had been put to death, but
mentioned groups of executions cited in Iranian and other media from
July through September that included 1,140 political executions and
others for common crimes.
   The Washington office of the People's Mujahedeen said there has
been ``a dramatic rise in political arrests, torture and executions
in Iran'' since September.
   ``Specifically, in the last three months alone, more than 10,000
persons have been arrested and thousands executed on the charge of
opposition'' to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's regime, said a
statement by spokesman Aladdin Touran distributed at U.N.
headquarters.
   The U.N. report notes that the executions followed a July 25-28
raid into Iran by National Liberation Army, the armed wing of the
People's Mujahedeen.
   It said persecution of Bahai worshipers appears to have
decreased, although Iran's attitude toward members of the faith has
not changed. Bahais are denied the right to practice their faith in
Iran, and cannot obtain higher education or work for the government.
   ``By July 1988, a number of Bahais including some prominent
members of the Bahai community who had been arrested, allegedly
because of their faith, were released from prison and some prison
sentences were reduced,'' the report said.
   Galindo Pohl interviewed seven Bahais and nine sympathizers of
the People's Mujahedeen who formerly lived in Iran in addition to
obtaining written accounts and information from Iranian media, his
report said.
   The report noted Iran's contention that Islamic law may not match
every tenet of international law and its disagreement with the
principle that ``adherence to international law is a must for every
state.''

   A convicted drug dealer who skipped his
sentencing a year ago and lived as a fugitive was caught when his
``good Samaritan'' instincts led him to aid a neighbor who was being
beaten and robbed, officials said.
   Clovis Fearon, 31, gave police a false name, Anthony Dixon, after
he killed one attacker and injured another with his unlicensed gun
early Wednesday in Brooklyn, rescuing 43-year-old Gertrude George.
   But after he was arrested on a gun possession charge, police
learned his real identity and found an outstanding arrest warrant
against him.
   Police said Fearon rushed out to help Ms. George when he heard
her screams from his apartment early Wednesday morning. Ms. George
lived on the same street but said later she did not know Fearon.
   ``I was just screaming, `Don't kill me,' because I thought that
was what they were going to do, kill me,'' Ms. George said. ``At one
point I thought I was going to die.''
   Ms. George said Fearon was ``the only one who came to my
assistance.''
   ``His actions, of course, were not criminal in any way in my mind
_ except for the possession of the gun,'' police Inspector Edward
Cappello said before Fearon's true identity was revealed.
   Fearon's gun was found by police inside his apartment. The
inspector said Fearon, whose car was recently burglarized,
complained to police at the scene about crime in the area.
   At his arraignment Wednesday night before Brooklyn Criminal Court
Judge Joseph Silverman, Fearon pleaded innocent to the gun charge
and bail was set at $500. But he remained held on the outstanding
warrant.
   Fearon had pleaded guilty Feb. 9, 1987, to third-degree criminal
sale of a controlled substance, punishable by up to seven years in
prison, said Assistant District Attorney Starlet Jones.
   He failed to appear for sentencing and a warrant was issued on
March 23, 1987, the prosecutor said.
   Timothy Lewis, 25, of Brooklyn, one of the men shot by Fearon,
was arrested for robbery, assault and criminal possession of stolen
property. The other alleged bandit, Raymond Plowden, 25, of
Brooklyn, was found dead a block from the scene clutching Ms.
George's jewelry in his hand, said Cappello.
   Lewis escaped but was arrested a short time later when he arrived
at Brookdale Hospital for treatment of his gunshot wound, police
said. He was in stable condition there.
   Plowden had been arrested five times, including three times for
robbery, and was wanted on a bench warrant at the time of his death,
police said. Lewis had three previous arrests, two on drug charges,
police said.
   Ms. George, a longtime resident of the Flatbush neighborhood, was
attacked while she was returning home from her job as a nurse, one
of two jobs she holds, police said.
   Fearon, a chef, came out of his house with a .38-caliber handgun
and fired three shots, hitting each man once in the back as they
stood over Ms. George, Cappello said.
   ``It could have been me dead,'' Ms. George said. ``The guy that
died showed me no mercy. He was very, very rough. He jumped me from
the back. He squeezed me by the throat, burst the chain off my neck
while the other man was searching my pockets.''
   Ms. George suffered cuts and bruises to her face but declined
treatment, Cappello said. She later identified both suspects.

<TEXT>
   Plaintiffs in a securities fraud trial
involving a $2.25 billion municipal bond default that was the
largest in U.S. history say they'll fight a $10 million settlement
offer they consider ``chicken feed.''
   Meanwhile, U.S. District Judge William Browning denied a request
for a mistrial Wednesday by one of the four remaining defendants in
the Washington Public Power Supply System case.
   The trial, which resumed Wednesday after a five-day recess, was
to continue today.
   A $226 million settlement between the plaintiffs, mostly WPPSS
bondholders, and most of the defendants was reached Monday. It
includes contributions of $181 million from 14 public utility
defendants, $35 million from the federal Bonneville Power
Administration and $10 million from Washington state.
   Arthur Hoffer, chairman of a committee of bondholder plaintiffs,
which also filed a separate class-action suit in Washington state
court against the state of Washington for alleged negligence, said
Wednesday in Seattle that his group would fight the state's
settlement offer in the federal suit.
   The offer is contingent upon the dropping of the bondholders'
state-level suit, which seeks $7.25 billion.
   Hoffer said Browning should not have jurisdiction to dismiss the
state case. ``It's a different court, different defendants,
different courses of action, different damages,'' he said.
   C. Richard Lehmann, treasurer of the bondholder committee, said
bondholders were unhappy with Bonneville Power Administration's
offer. Lehmann said they were ``quite happy'' with the $181 million
offered by the utilities, but he called the other offers ``chicken
feed.''
   Four defendants remain in the trial: the Snohomish County (Wash.)
Public Utility District, the sole remaining utility defendant;
engineering firms Ebasco Services Inc. and United Engineers and
Contractors Inc.; and financial adviser Blyth Eastman Paine Webber
Inc.
   They are accused of conspiring to lie and hide information that
might have discouraged potential investors of WPPSS municipal bonds
that were used to build two nuclear power plants.
   The unfinished plants were scrapped in 1982 and WPPSS defaulted
on the bonds a year later.
   On Wednesday, Chemical Bank attorney Thomas Barr played tapes of
meetings by the seven-member participants committee that made
decisions for the 88 utilities involved in the projects.
   The tapes from mid-1981 revealed the utilities feared that
terminating the plants would drive some of the utilities into
bankruptcy and that the committee discussed the merits of defaulting
on the bonds.
   The trial was recessed Oct. 27, when Browning told the jury that
efforts were under way that might shorten the trial.
   Before the trial resumed, Browning denied a request for a
mistrial by the Snohomish County utility. Attorneys in the case
refused to discuss the request, citing the judge's gag order.
   When the trial resumed, Browning told the 17 jurors that
settlements had been reached but that the jurors should not infer
anything from them.
   Browning reminded the jury who the remaining defendants were. He
also reminded the panel that Chemical Bank of New York, a trustee
for bondholders, was suing only the Snohomish County utility and
that the class plaintiff representing more than 24,000 past and
present bondholders had claims against all the remaining defendants.
   Browning had ruled before the trial begain Sept. 7 that no
mention of settlements be made to the jury, even though key former
defendants, including WPPSS itself, were no longer in the case but
frequently were mentioned in opening statements and testimony.
   The trial was moved to Tucson because it was not felt an unbiased
jury could be found in Washington state.

<TEXT>
   Former child star Shirley Temple Black, who has
served Republican administrations in several diplomatic posts, says
she wants to be head of the U.S. Information Agency if George Bush
is elected president.
   The one-time darling of Depression-era movie fans auditioned for
the part on a television interview broadcast today, saying her years
in films and government have prepared her to run the United States'
main voice abroad.
   ``I haven't told George Bush this yet, I should tell him before I
tell you. But I would like to be the director of the United States
Information Agency,'' Mrs. Black said in a taped appearance on the
CBS News ``Nightwatch'' program.
   Mrs. Black, 60, lit up the dark days of the Great Depression as
the nation's top box office star between 1935 and 1938. Her career
began at age 3 and her curly hair and adorable smile brought her
world fame and an Oscar by the time she was 6.
   She told an interviewer she wanted ``to sell you on this'' by
pointing to her years in Hollywood and the second career she has
built in Washington.
   She was a U.S representative to the United Nations under
President Nixon and was Chief of Protocol and U.S. ambassador to
Ghana under President Ford.
   ``I've had 57 years of the communications business, with all
parts of the media. And I've had 19 years of government service in
international relations and I would do a super job for you ... ,''
Mrs. Black said she would tell Bush.
   Mrs. Black, interviewed in Washington, said she has been helping
train ambassadors due to for overseas posting by the State
Department under President Reagan. She has also contributed ``a
little'' money to Bush's Republican campaign effort.
   ``I have always been willing to serve, and I'll serve wherever
I'm asked to serve. But I want it to be substantive. I don't like
make-work,'' she said.
   The USIA, which spreads the official American government word to
overseas audiences, is currently led by Charles Z. Wick.

<HEAD>Study Implicates Climate Change In Dinosaurs' Demise</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Global cooling put dinosaurs and other
creatures in jeopardy of extinction, says a study suggesting neither
volcanic eruptions nor asteroids striking Earth could be the sole
cause of a mass wipeout 66 million years ago.
   ``The climate was going through a severe change approximately
200,000 years before the mass extinctions,'' said University of
California, Santa Barbara, geologist Lowell D. Stott, who presented
the findings Wednesday at the Geological Society of America's annual
meeting in Denver.
   Stott said he and his co-author, UCSB geologist James P. Kennett,
believe the cooling trend ``may have made these organisms
susceptible to events associated with an (asteroid or comet) impact
or other phenomena,'' such as volcanic eruptions.
   The extinctions ``appear to have resulted from several things
happening within a relatively short period of time,'' Kennett said.
   Many scientists believe the mass extinctions happened because
eruptions or objects smashing into Earth sent enough dust and soot
skyward to block out sunlight, plunging the planet into darkness and
cold that killed foods many creatures needed for survival.
   The new study doesn't rule out either possibility, but shows
Earth's climate started getting colder earlier, Stott said by phone
from Denver.
   Stott and Kennett studied the amount of two forms of oxygen in
tiny fossil seashells. They determined that ocean temperatures near
Antarctica dropped 2 to 4 degrees about 200,000 years before
dinosaurs and about two-thirds of other species died.
   ``Certainly this major change in climate must have had a
significant effect on plants and animals living at the time,'' Stott
said. ``However, it appears to be more of a contributing factor to,
rather than a direct cause of, the extinctions.''
   The theory that an asteroid or comet striking Earth triggered
mass extinctions was first proposed in 1980 by a team of University
of California, Berkeley, scientists led by Nobel laureate physicist
Luis Alvarez.
   Many fossil experts countered that the mass extinction 66 million
years ago occurred in a stepwise fashion, with the die-off
stretching over a period of hundreds of thousands of years.
   That prompted the Berkeley team to modify the theory, saying the
extinctions were caused by a shower of asteroids or comets over a
longer period.
   A growing number of researchers support that theory, although
others insist volcanic eruptions were responsible. Some say asteroid
impacts could have smashed deep enough to trigger eruptions. Others
dispute the impact and volcanic theories, arguing that gradual
climate change coupled with changes in sea levels caused extinctions.
   The UCSB study suggests there may be truth to all the theories.
   No one knows what caused the cooling detected by Kennett and
Stott. One possibility is that the amount of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere declined, causing a ``reverse greenhouse effect'' in
which less solar radiation was trapped by the gas, causing
temperatures to drop.
   Another theory, Stott said, is that new seaways gradually opened
and closed as the continents drifted. Resulting changes in ocean
circulation could change global temperatures, he explained.
   It also is possible that ``an earlier impact before the big one
that killed the dinosaurs was responsible both for cooling and for
some extinctions that took place earlier,'' said astrophysicist
Richard Muller, a member of Alvarez' team at UC-Berkeley and
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.
   The idea that extinctions had multiple causes also is possible,
Muller said by phone from Berkeley.
   Stott and Kennett detected ancient climactic cooling by studying
the ratios of oxygen-18 and oxygen-16 in fossilized plankton shells
taken from rocks beneath the Weddell Sea in Antarctica. The shells
absorbed oxygen when the creatures lived. Oceans contains less
oxygen-18 when the water is warmer and more when the water is cooler.

<HEAD>AMA Seeks to Halt Testing of `Smokeless Cigarettes'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Medical Association moved to stop
sales of a new ``smokeless cigarette'' being marketed by R.J.
Reynolds Co., saying the product is nothing more than a delivery
system for the drug nicotine.
   The nation's largest medical association filed petitions in two
states Wednesday in an effort to halt distribution of the product,
called Premier.
   R.J. Reynolds countered with a news release saying the AMA was
both inaccurate and hypocritical.
   ``Premier smoke substantially reduces many of the chemical
compounds that the critics of smoking have been complaining about,''
Reynolds' release said. ``Reynolds finds it difficult to understand
how the AMA can in good faith suggest that Premier be banned.
   ``Premier is a cigarette ... not a drug-delivery system, as the
AMA has alleged.''
   The AMA's legal challenge was filed in petitions in Arizona and
Missouri, where the product is being test marketed.
   In April, the association petitioned the federal Food and Drug
Administration to regulate Premier as a drug, although cigarettes
currently are not regulated that way. That petition is pending.
   Premier contains nicotine, an ``addictive drug ... which has been
implicated in cardiovascular disease, complications of
hypertension'' and other medical problems, the AMA said.
   ``The scientific evidence is crystal clear about the adverse
health effects of nicotine and carbon monoxide,'' Dr. Roy Schwarz of
the AMA said at a news conference.
   The FDA currently does not regulate tobacco products unless they
make a medical claim, spokesman William Grigg said. He said the AMA
maintains in its FDA petition that Premier should be regulated
because it makes ``an inherent health claim.''
   The main difference between Premier and other cigarettes is that
the tobacco in them is warmed, not burned, said Reynolds spokeswoman
Maura Payne in Winston-Salem, N.C.
   She said the cigarettes contain a nicotine level of 0.4
milligrams and carbon monoxide ``at about the same level as a
`lights' brand.''
   The cigarettes also show a ``virtual elimination of sidestream
smoke, or smoke off the lit end of the cigarette, the elimination of
ash and no tobacco aroma,'' she said.
   But R.J. Reynolds, a subsidiary of RJR Nabisco, said it has
treated Premier no differently than any other cigarette.
   The company began selling Premier in Tucson, Ariz., Phoenix and
St. Louis around Oct. 1, but no date had been set for national
distribution. Ms. Payne said the cost per pack would run about 25
percent higher than other cigarettes.
   Health officials in Arizona and Missouri said the issue in their
states boils down to a question of jurisdiction.
   Dr. Robert Harmon, director of the Missouri Department of Health,
said his state had been considering action against Premier for some
time but he expected any decision was at least a week away.
   ``I agree that the product should be regulated as a drug and I
wrote to the FDA on Feb. 25 asking it to do so,'' Harmon said. ``It
is mainly a matter of state or federal jurisdiction.''
   Joe Rowan, deputy director of the Arizona Board of Pharmacy,
which received the AMA's petition, said the document ``has been
taken to the state Attorney General's office.''
   ``They will advise the board as to what action they can take or
should take, if any,'' he said.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A blustery storm swept across Maine and began its exit into
Canada today as another storm entered the Pacific Northwest, dumping
rain and snow while whipping up winds.
   In the northeastern United States, rain and snow diminished as
the low pressure system moved northward, leaving behind light rain
from northern New England and upstate New York on Wednesday evening.
   In New York earlier Wednesday, as many as 20,000 customers were
without electricity after a snowstorm dumped a foot or more of snow
on parts of the Adirondack Mountains, a utility spokesman said.
   Meanwhile, in the Pacific Northwest, the cold front brought rain
from the northern and central Pacific Coast to the northern Rockies.
   In Oregon, northern coastal areas were hit with high winds. Gusts
of 98 mph were recorded at Cape Blanco, 74 mph at Gold Beach, 61 mph
at Astoria and 47 mph at Salemn and North Bend.
   In the higher passes of the Olympic and Cascade mountains of
Washington, at least 8 inches of snow was possible today. Snow was
also reported in the mountains of central Idaho.
   The Colorado Rockies and Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., were
lightly dusted with snow, while northeastern Texas and southwestern
Arkansas received a few showers and thunderstorms.
   Today's forecast called for a few thunderstorms over southern
Florida and the lower Mississippi Valley; widespread showers from
the northern Pacific Coast to the northern and central Rockies,
widely scattered showers from eastern portions of Montana and
Wyoming; snow over higher elevations of the Rockies; snow in the
mountains of northern New England; and gusty winds over the northern
Rockies.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 50s over the Pacific
Northwest and from the northern Plains through the Great Lakes to
New Jersey and southern New England; the 40s over northern New
England and northern Minnesota; the 80s across much of Florida,
Louisiana, Texas and southeast New Mexico; the 90s over southern
Texas; the 80s and 90s over the desert Southwest, and the 60s or 70s
throughout much of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 27
degrees at Oscoda, Mich., to 77 degrees at Homestead, Fla.

<HEAD>Vietnam Returns 23 Sets Of Remains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam today turned over to a U.S.
military team what it believes are the remains of 23 Americans
unaccounted for from the Vietnam War, a U.S. spokesman said. It was
one of the largest such turnovers.
   A U.S. military honor guard solemnly saluted as the remains, in
coffins draped with folded U.S. flags, were loaded onto a Hercules
C-141 transport plane during a short ceremony at Hanoi's Noi Bai
Airport, Maj. Dan Trout said.
   The plane left the Vietnamese capital for Guam, en route to
Honolulu. There, the U.S. Central Identification Laboratory will try
to confirm the preliminary analyses done by the Vietnamese, said
Trout, spokesman for the U.S. Pacific Command.
   Trout said the remains included 21 sets the Vietnamese found in
their own searches and the two sets that U.S.-Vietnamese teams
recovered during unprecedented joint field investigations near Hanoi
from Sept. 25 to Oct. 5.
   The Vietnamese provided a list of some names and information on
the remains, Trout said without elaborating. Sources said earlier
that Vietnam has given the United States a list of at least nine
names.
   Today's return was among the largest since the January 1973 Paris
Peace Accords ended U.S. military involvement in a war that claimed
58,000 American lives. The communists defeated the U.S.-backed South
Vietnam government in April 1975.
   Trout said that since the accords, the United States has received
the identified remains of 196 missing persons, including 168 from
Vietnam, 26 from Laos and two from China. That leaves 2,387
Americans missing in action, or MIA, in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
   In August 1987, Vietnam's foreign minister, Nguyen Co Thach, and
a special U.S. presidential envoy, retired Gen. John W. Vessey,
reached agreement to hasten cooperation on the MIA issue.
   Today's turnover brought to 90 the number of suspected remains
Vietnam has provided since the Thach-Vessey agreement. So far, the
U.S. laboratory has identified 25 set of remains as those of missing
Americans.
   Also today, seven U.S. military specialists returned to Bangkok
after winding up a second joint field investigation with the
Vietnamese. They were to have inspected U.S. warplane crash sites
and other areas west of Hanoi during the 10-day project, Trout said.
   ``They didn't run into any serious weather problems,'' Trout
said. ``They did not find any specific remains this time.''
   He said that as with the first joint investigation, the teams
were trying to resolve ``discrepancy cases'' _ those in which the
United States says there is evidence Vietnamese authorities have
information on the servicemen's fate. These includes cases of airmen
captured but never returned.
   Most American losses in northern Vietnam were airmen shot down
during bombing runs.
   Vietnam had for years refused repeated requests for the field
investigations. U.S. officials said they were gratified by the
recent cooperation on the issue, long subjected to emotional
bickering between the two countries.
   But Ted Sampley, head of the National Steering Committee for
American War Veterans, on Wednesday accused the Vietnamese of using
turnovers for political ends.
   ``They are timing it for the presidential election,'' Sampley
said in a telephone interview from the United States.
   The committee, a private lobbying group, has accused Washington
of pursuing only the remains of the dead while covering up purported
evidence of Americans still held prisoner in Indochina.

   A dozen Vietnam War veterans will return to
Vietnam and build a health clinic on a 14-acre former military
compound near Ho Chi Minh City, says the leader of a veterans' group.
   ``A lot of people didn't think we were serious, but we're
going,'' Fred Champagne, leader of the Veterans Vietnam Restoration
Project, said in this northern California city Wednesday.
   Champagne said he and Ross von Arx returned 10 days ago from a
series of meetings with Vietnamese officials and that a formal
letter of approval soon followed.
   The letter from Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach gives
the Humboldt County group permission to send a 12-member team of
veterans to build the clinic.
   Champagne said the Vietnamese government has offered the former
military facility at Vuing Tau on the Vietnamese coast and a beach
house at no cost.
   ``Our own State Department has given us permission and clearance
for the project,'' he said. The United States has no formal
relations with Vietnam.
   Plans call for the first veterans team to arrive in Vietnam the
second week of January, said Champagne.
   Members of the group will meet in San Francisco on Saturday to
map out a fund-raising campaign and determine who will go to
Vietnam, Champagne said.
   ``We've got 10 weeks to raise $50,000,'' the amount neeeded to
build the clinic, he said.

<HEAD>Rish Convicted Of Kidnap, Murder Of Small</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT LEE ZIMMER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KANKAKEE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury took less than two hours to convict
a 26-year-old woman of murder and kidnapping for helping her
boyfriend abduct prominent businessman Stephen Small and bury him
alive.
   The swift conviction of Nancy Rish on Wednesday should end a
``terrible nightmare'' for Small's family since his kidnapping in
1987, said prosecutor Michael Ficaro. Small suffocated in a homemade
box before his family could pay a $1 million ransom.
   Daniel Edwards, 31, with whom Ms. Rish lived in nearby
Bourbonnais, was convicted in May of murder and kidnapping, and was
sentenced to death.
   Ms. Rish faces a maximum sentence of life in prison without
parole, said prosecutor Michael Ficaro. A presentencing hearing was
scheduled for Dec. 6.
   Ms. Rish cried as the jurors filed from the crowded courtroom
after delivering their verdict to Kankakee Circuit Judge John
Michela. The jury had deliberated for only one hour and 40 minutes
after a nine-day trial.
   ``I am very disappointed that this jury didn't consider the case
longer,'' said defense attorney Vincent Paulauskis. ``I think there
was reasonable doubt.''
   Paulauskis contended that Ms. Rish had no idea what Edwards was
plotting, and that Edwards' real accomplices have not been
apprehended. Ficaro, however, said there is no evidence anyone else
helped with the kidnapping.
   In his closing arguments, Ficaro told jurors that Rish was the
``actress'' and ``accomplished liar'' her boyfriend needed to lure
Small from his home so he could be abducted.
   Small, 40, member of a prominent media family and great-grandson
of a former Illinois governor, was kidnapped Sept. 2, 1987 and
buried in the coffin-like box in a remote area between Kankakee and
the Indiana border. His body was unearthed two days later.
   Ficaro said it was Ms. Rish who called Small to get him out of
his house while Edwards waited in the garage to kidnap him. She
pretended to be a police officer reporting a burglary at a building
Small was restoring, he said.

   Federal narcotics officers were poised to make the
biggest cocaine bust ever in Dallas, but it turned out the white
powder they confiscated was for baking, not snorting.
   And the elderly man who attempted to pull off the drug deal wound
up in custody and in the hospital instead of being in the money,
said Phil Jordan, who is in charge of the Drug Enforcement
Administration's Dallas office.
   It turned out that the 100 kilograms of cocaine the man was
attempting to sell to DEA agents posing as drug dealers was 220
pounds of flour and sugar, Jordan said.
   ``We found out he wasn't selling the real thing, and he found out
we were the real thing,'' said Jordan said.
   Jordan said he expects that state charges will be filed against
the man accusing him of attempting to sell substances misrepresented
as drugs. It is a felony under Texas law to attempt to sell any
substance represented to be illegal drugs.
   Jordan said the 71-year-old man suffered an ``anxiety attack''
after learning the men were agents and not drug dealers and was
hospitalized with chest pains. He was listed in serious condition
today at St. Paul Medical Center.
   ``He's lucky he was dealing with law enforcement rather than a
vicious criminal drug element,'' Jordan said. ``The underworld
doesn't take kindly to fraud.
   ``If he'd been dealing with the Cubans, the Jamaicans or the
Colombians, he wouldn't have lived to tell his story to the judge,''
Jordan said.
   The deal began a month ago, Jordan said, when a man approached an
undercover DEA agent and asked if the agent was interested in buying
100 kilos of cocaine.
   DEA officials decided the man might be serious because one of his
associates had recently been arrested with five kilos of cocaine,
Jordan said.
   The man was arrested after he produced the substance in an
airport parking lot at Love Field. A quick field test of the white
substance revealed that it was sugar and flour.
   The man had offered to sell the bogus drugs at $18,000 per kilo,
making the entire buy worth $1.8 million, he said.
   It wasn't a total loss, Jordan said.
   ``Well, we got the flour and sugar just in time for the
holidays,'' he said. ``After we use it as evidence, we plan to
donate it to one of the area food banks.''

<TEXT>
   The HBO program ``The Vietnam War Story''
received the most acclaim as Home Box Office dominated the
nominations for the 10th annual ACE Awards for cable TV programming.
   ``The Vietnam War Story,'' a 30-minute dramatic anthology series,
won 18 nominations Wednesday for the awards, which will be presented
in January.
   ``Mandela,'' an HBO drama based on the life of South African
black activist Nelson Mandela, received eight nominations. The HBO
drama ``The Man Who Broke 1,000 Chains'' also received eight
nominations.
   ``The HBO Comedy Hour Live'' garnered seven nominations. Six each
went to Showtime's ``It's Garry Shandling's Show,'' and ``The Race
for the Double Helix'' on the Arts & Entertainment Channel.
   HBO received 114 of the 324 nominations this year, more than the
next five cable programmers combined. Arts & Entertainment was
second with 32 nominations, followed by Showtime with 23, Cable News
Network with 20, the Disney Channel with 18, USA Network with 15,
the Discovery Channel with 14, and Superstation TBS with 13.
   Individual nominations went to such stars as Danny Glover and
Alfre Woodard for their roles as Nelson and Winnie Mandela in
``Mandela;'' Tate Donovan, Todd Graff, Wesley Snipes and Cynthia
Bain for ``The Vietnam War Story;'' and Roseanne Barr, Garry
Shandling, Robert Townsend, Robin Williams, Billy Crystal, Whoopi
Goldberg and Jane Alexander.
   The ACE awards will be presented during a live broadcast Jan. 15
over 10 of the largest basic-cable networks. The ceremonies will
originate from the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles. The craft awards
will be handed out at a dinner the night before in Beverly Hills.
   The awards are made by the National Academy of Cable Programming,
a division of the National Cable Television Association. In
September, cable shows and performers participated in the Emmy
awards for the first time, but the cable industry said it would
continue its own awards program.
   ``The Vietnam War Story'' was nominated as best dramatic series,
along with USA Network's ``Ray Bradbury Theatre'' and HBO's ``Tanner
'88,'' a dramatized spoof of the 1988 presidential campaign.
   ``The Vietnam War Story'' also picked up three directing
nominations, four writing nominations, two for photography and one
each for art direction and makeup.
   ``Mandela'' was nominated as best movie or miniseries, as were
``The Man Who Broke 1,000 Chains,'' Disney Channel's ``Jean
Shepherd's Ollie Hopnoodle's Haven of Bliss,'' A&E's ``After
Pilkington'' and A&E's ``The Race for the Double Helix.''
   ``Mandela'' also received nominations for directing, writing,
costume design, film editing and original score.

<HEAD>Duchess Of York Returns To Britain And Her Baby After Six Week
Break</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Duchess of York returned to London today after
six weeks in Australia, carrying a toy koala bear as a present for
the 12-week-old baby girl she left behind in Britain.
   The 29-year-old duchess arrived at London's Heathrow Airport with
a white fluffy toy bear under her arm. She smiled at waiting
photographers but said nothing before she got into her Jaguar car
and took the wheel to drive into London.
   The baby, Princess Beatrice, stayed in Britain with a nanny while
the duchess, the former Sarah Ferguson, was in Australia with her
husband, Prince Andrew, second oldest son of Queen Elizabeth II.
   Andrew, 28, a Royal Navy helicopter pilot, will remain with his
ship, the guided-missile destroyer HMS Edinburgh, and is not
expected back in Britain until Dec. 16.
   The couple had a narrow escape from serious injury Wednesday in
Fremantle, western Australia, when a steel cable securing the
Edinburgh to the dock snapped as they were saying goodbye.
   The duchess _ on the dock chatting with Andrew, who was on the
lower deck of the ship _ was whisked to safety by a security man who
saw the cable about to snap less than three yards from where she
stood.
   Andrew and other crew members ducked for cover as the cable
lashed back like a whip and smashed into the ship's hull.
   The duchess flew from Britain to Australia on Sept. 21 on her own
and met up with Andrew there for the couple's 10-day official tour
to help celebrate Australia's bicentennial.
   When Andrew returned to his ship, the duchess extended her stay
in Australia to have more time with him, traveling from port to port
to meet his ship.
   She also visited relatives in Australia and the British domestic
news agency Press Association said she comforted her elder sister
Jane over the reported breakup of her marriage with Australian
farmer Alex Makim.
   British tabloids criticized the duchess for spending so much time
away from her baby, who was born on Aug. 8. The duchess and Andrew
shrugged off the criticism and Buckingham Palace, as is customary,
refused to comment on the issue.

   A man who abducted a 3-year-old girl in front of
her home, sexually assaulted her and left her in an outhouse pit was
scheduled to be paroled early next year after serving less than half
of a 10-year sentence.
   The imminent parole of Robert Thiret, 26, has stirred some
controversy here, where sentiment against him ran so high that he
wore a bulletproof vest when he appeared in court in 1984 to plead
guilty to attempted murder and sexual assault.
   Ed Gruninger Jr., an uncle of the victim, Lori Poland, and a law
enforcement officer for 12 years, said he doesn't think anyone's
happy with the parole scheduled for March 13.
   ``But there is nothing we can do about it. I just hope he has
learned a lesson and stays away from our family.''
   Lori was discovered in an outhouse pit in Stapleton Mountain Park
three days after her abduction. The Poland family later sued Thiret
and won a $2.4 million settlement.
   Thiret's parole from Canon City penitentiary is mandatory under
Colorado law, which allows time off for good behavior in prison.

<TEXT>
   A shipping company that was ordered
closed after one of its ships sank in 1987 with thousands of people
aboard and another went down during Typhoon Ruby was cleared of
blame today in the 1987 tragedy.
   A 69-page coast guard report blamed the December 1987 disaster on
the 630-ton oil tanker Vector, which collided with the passenger
ship Dona Paz off Mindoro island. More than 3,000 people are
believed to have died.
   The Dona Paz was owned by Sulpicio Lines, whose passenger
operations were suspended by the government on Wednesday after
another of its vessels, the Dona Marilyn, sank Oct. 24 during
Typhoon Ruby, killing at least 76 people.
   In the report, Pio Garrido, coast guard commandant, said a board
of inquiry found the Vector at fault because it lacked qualified
crew and equipment and had sailed without valid licenses.
   ``The operation of the MT Vector was not only risky but unlawful
for want of the requisite licenses and certificates for her vessel
and her officers,'' the report said. ``MT Vector and her registered
owners are adjudged solely at fault and responsible for the
collision.''
   Sulpicio Vice President Vicente Gambito praised the coast guard
report. ``We welcome this opportunity to vindicate the idea that our
ships are unsafe and there is something patently wrong with our
ships,'' he said.
   On Wednesday, President Corazon Aquino ordered Sulpicio's
passenger services suspended while the government inspects its crews
and ships.
   Sulpicio, which operates 22 passenger and cargo vessels, accounts
for 20 percent of domestic sea traffic among the country's 7,200
islands.
   But Gambito said today that Sulpicio had still not received the
suspension order and was operating normally.
   In its report, the coast guard said the Vector rammed the Dona
Paz on the port side, immediately knocking out the engine and
generator. Oil from the tanker ignited and the two vessels
disappeared in a huge fireball.
   Only 26 people survived, all but two from the Dona Paz. Only two
junior crewmen from the Vector were rescued.
   The coast guard said the Vector had a steering defect and sailed
without a certificate of inspection. The ship had no radio operator
and its radio license had expired nearly 18 months earlier, the
report said.
   It also found that the ship's master, who was killed, did not
have the required Chief Mate License and that there was no lookout
on duty on the Vector's bridge when the collision occurred.
   Mrs. Aquino's order suspending Sulpicio came nine days after the
2,855-ton Dona Marilyn sank during Typhoon Ruby with about 500
people aboard.
   The two accidents prompted calls from the press and Congress for
tougher enforcement of maritime safety regulations and for
investigations into the seaworthiness of the inter-island fleet.
   Meanwhile, the search for victims of the Dona Marilyn sinking
continued today. Like the Dona Paz, it has been difficult to
determine the number of victims because of confusion over how many
people were aboard.
   The Dona Marilyn sailed Oct. 23 from Manila. After it sank 300
miles southeast of Manila, 161 passengers and 39 crewmen were
rescued. Gambito said at least 76 people were confirmed dead but
only 54 bodies had been recovered.

   Barry Minkow, the fallen whiz kid of Wall
Street, says he's as good as dead for testifying about a purported
mob takeover of his ZZZZ Best carpet cleaning company.
   ``I've got two choices, 500 years or death by the mob,'' he
shouted from the stand Wednesday at his fraud trial. ``Now I'm going
to talk. My life's over. They're not going to let me live.''
   In more than a week on the stand, the 22-year-old who started his
business at 16 in his parents' garage has portrayed himself as a
helpless puppet of organized crime figures.
   On Wednesday, he snapped at Assistant U.S. Attorney Gordon
Greenberg, who questioned his version of events.
   ``The only proof, Mr. Greenberg, is going to be when they kill me
five years from now,'' Minkow exclaimed. ``Then you'll believe me.''
   Minkow said a mobster visited him in prison before he took the
stand, kissed him on both cheeks and warned: ``Say the right thing
or I'll kill you.''
   ``I don't think anyone on earth could protect me if they wanted
to kill them (my parents) or me,'' the defendant said. ``You can't
hide from these guys.''
   The government contends that despite his age, Minkow was a clever
con man who bilked investors out of some $25 million. He faces 57
charges of securities, credit card and mail fraud.
   Minkow's company, once a hot item on Wall Street, was built on
fraudulent claims of huge contracts for carpet restoration work. He
has admitted lying, manipulating funds and defrauding investors.
   Ten defendants have pleaded guilty to fraud charges.

<TEXT>
   Donald Gene Franklin, whose appeal
halted executions in the state for more than nine months, was put to
death early today for abducting and murdering a nurse 13 years ago.
   Franklin, 37, made no final statement before a lethal injection
was administered at the Texas Department of Corrections' Wall Unit.
   Franklin stared at the death chamber ceiling and coughed several
times as drugs flowing through needles inserted into his arms took
effect. He was pronounced dead at 12:30 a.m., six minutes after
doctors began administering the injection.
   Franklin was the second person executed this year in Texas, which
leads the nation with 28 executions since the U.S. Supreme Court
restored capital punishment in 1976. He was the 102nd person
executed in the United States since then.
   Franklin spent 12{ years on death row, and had three trials and
at least five execution dates. His own attorney once described him
as therawford,
said today. ``I feel really relieved. I feel I can be at peace and
Peggy can be at peace.''
   At the time of the execution, she said, she was looking at a
picture of her daughter.
   ``It's been a long hard day,'' she said. ``It's been a very, very
long 13 years.''
   Franklin's hopes for a reprieve were blocked late Wednesday when
the U.S. Supreme Court voted 7-2 to refuse him a stay.
   The nation's highest court had granted Franklin a stay in October
1987 to consider his challenge of Texas' capital punishment law. His
attorneys argued that the law does not say how much weight a jury
should give to a defendant's mitigating circumstances.
   The challenge put a halt to executions in Texas after Jan. 7,
when Robert Streetman, 27, was put to death for murdering a woman in
a $1 burglary.
   In June, the nation's highest court voted 6-3 to reject
Franklin's challenge.
   Franklin spent his final day in a small cell next to the death
chamber, and was visited by his parents.
   In 1975, Ms. Moran's disappearance from a San Antonio hospital
prompted a highly publicized citywide search. Five days after her
abduction, she was found in a vacant lot, nude, bleeding from
multiple stab wounds and barely alive. She died later in a hospital.
   Franklin was on parole for a rape conviction when he was arrested
about four hours after the abduction, but consistently denied any
involvement in Ms. Moran's disappearance.
   ``He just told me he was framed for something he didn't do,'' a
fellow death row inmate, Johnny Penry, said Wednesday.
   Witnesses provided the license plate number of a car speeding
away from the hospital. The car was Franklin's.
   Police also found the nurse's belongings in his garbage can and
blood found on his clothing matched Ms. Moran's.
   ``This is a case I use as the classic circumstantial evidence
case,'' said Bill Harris, a Bexar County district attorney who
handled Franklin's case. ``We had overwhelming evidence. It's an
appropriate case for the death penalty and he's an appropriate
subject.''
   ``The worst part, in my mind, is that Franklin is the most hated
man in San Antonio, at least in recent history,'' said Allen Cazier,
who defended Franklin at his third trial.

<HEAD>Algerians Vote In Election That Could Change One-Party Rule</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with early election results, those

<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A month after 176 people died in
anti-government riots, Algerians voted today on political reforms
that would shift power away from the single party that has ruled for
26 years.
   The referendum to modify 14 articles of the constitution was
proposed in October after youths rioted in the streets of Algiers
and other cities to protest shortages of food and jobs. Lower living
standards are blamed on the dropping price of oil, Algeria's chief
export.
   First reported results were of absentee ballots cast by Algerians
living in southern France. The Algerian Consulate in Marseille said
nearly 90 percent of those voting favored constitutional change.
   It announced results of 41,039 yes to 3,532 no, with 1,126 people
casting ``null'' ballots _ a form of abstention.
   ``It's the beginning of change,'' 34-year-old businessman Joubi
Wacer said after voting at a school in Bir Mouradais neighborhood.
``After this, things will be different. At least we hope so.''
   Under clear blue skies, several elderly, veiled women walked to
vote at the Bir Mouradais school. Men milled in the courtyard,
smoking and discussing political changes their country seems to be
experiencing. In remote southern parts, nomads traveled long
distances to cast their ballots.
   President Chadli Bendjedid soothed the unrest by promising a
greater role in decision-making to people outside the National
Liberation Front. As this North African country's only legal party,
it has ruled since Algeria's independence from France in 1962.
   Today's voting appeared calm. There were no indications of
heightened security in Algiers, the capital where soldiers and
police fired on demonstrators last month. Officials set the
nationwide death toll from a week's rioting at 176. But other
reports say three times as many people died.
   The Justice Ministry announced today that it released on
Wednesday all 3,357 people still held after being arrested during
the rioting. That figure was much higher than the 1,500 previously
believed to remain in jail, but there was no immediate explanation
for the discrepancy.
   Algerian television showed film of dozens of young men emerging
from El Harrach prison near Algiers into a crowd of families and
supporters who patted them on the backs or shook their hands.
   Because most vote-counting is computerized in Algeria, nearly
complete results were expected before midnight.
   State radio said an estimated 25 percent of those eligible voted
within three hours of the polls opening.
   More than 90 percent of Algeria's 12 million eligible voters have
turned out in past elections.
   Bendjedid's proposal to shift power out of the hands of the party
is ``extraordinary, a veritable revolution for Algeria,'' said Kamel
Belkacem, publisher of the pro-reform weekly newspaper Algerie
Actualite.
   Provisions before voters would make subtle but important changes
separating government from the party. The constitution would say the
president ``incarnates the unity of the nation,'' replacing wording
that he ``incarnates the unity of the ... party and the state.''
   Another change would allow the president to shift unspecified
powers to the premier, who would in future answer to the People's
National Assembly, Algeria's parliament.
   If independent candidates eventually are elected to parliament,
this would separate the day-to-day working of the government from
party control.

   A crewman knocked to the deck by three
explosions aboard a barge carrying thousands of gallons of fuel
lowered himself by a rope and waded 100 feet ashore, but three other
men were missing, officials said.
   ``There doesn't appear to be very much hope for any survivors,''
said State Trooper Cpl. Mike Marrs.
   The cause of Wednesday's explosions and fire was not known, the
Coast Guard said. The first explosion occurred as the captain and
the engineer were changing over to another generator in the engine
room, Marrs said.
   Stephen M. Hobbs, the first mate, said an explosion knocked him
down in the wheelhouse, at the front of the vessel, according to Dan
Gregory, a fire battalion chief.
   ``When he looked back, all he saw was fire ... the intense
radiant heat forced him off the ship,'' Gregory said. Hobbs was in
good condition.
   The barge, owned by Motor Vessel Constructor Co. in Homer, had
20,000 gallons of gasoline and 36,000 gallons of diesel fuel below
decks, Marrs said.
   A tanker truck that was aboard had been hired to shuttle fuel to
holding tanks at a crude-oil processing facility operated by
Marathon Oil Co. The crew had pumped 1,000 gallons of gasoline into
the truck before the explosion, Marrs said.
   Missing were the captain, the engineer and a fuel-truck driver.

   A classics professor who received Ohio
State University's highest teaching award plunged 12 stories to his
death from a parking garage in an apparent suicide, police said.
   John Vaughn, 41, taught a class in mythology that attracted
hundreds of students and sometimes had a waiting list.
   A parking attendant saw Vaughn pacing the top floor of the garage
Wednesday and approached to see if he needed help, said manager
Charles Bruns. Without a word, Vaughn took off his coat, sat on a
ledge and fell backward, the attendant reported.
   Vaughn received an alumni award for distinguished teaching in
1981, one of eight professors so honored that year, university
spokesman Steve Sterrett said.
   Franklin County Coroner William Adrion tentatively ruled the
death a suicide.

   The pilot reported engine problems Wednesday, seconds before the

   The plane took off from Allegheny County Airport south of
Pittsburgh and was testing an electronic signal emitted by a system

   Thomas Reed's trial over an attempt by
the head of the Alabama NAACP to rip the Confederate battle flag
from the state Capitol is in an indefinite recess, and a verdict
might not come for weeks.
   ``It might be after the first of the year,'' said defense
attorney Ernestine Sapp.
   The state representative's non-jury trial began Wednesday, but
Judge Craig Miller declared a recess later in the day because he had
other cases scheduled.
   Reed and 13 other black legislators were arrested and charged
with criminal trespass Feb. 2 after grabbing a fence around the
Capitol and annoucing they would rip down the Confederate flag,
which they contend is a symbol of racism.
   Miller granted a prosecution request Wednesday to try each
legislator individually, beginning with Reed.
   Reed, 60, in 1970 became one of the first two blacks this century
to win a seat in the Assembly. He is not up for for re-election next
week.
   He was convicted of extortion Sept. 30 in an unrelated case, and
a court ordered his removal from office upon sentencing. No
sentencing date has been set.

<TEXT>
   Newspapers today hailed the U.S.
prosecution of Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos, but some saw it as a
warning that Washington can turn on an ally if that serves American
interests.
   Others said American indignation should have been aroused in 1972
when Marcos declared martial law, jailed thousands of political
opponents and allegedly began plundering of the Philippine treasury.
   The commentaries appeared after American tobacco heiress Doris
Duke on Wednesday put up $5 million for the former Philippine first
lady to secure bail on racketeering charges.
   U.S. District Judge John Keenan postponed Marcos' arraignment
pending results of a medical examination. The former Philippine
president claimes he is too ill to travel to New York from Hawaii,
where he has lived since his ouster in a popular-military revolt in
February 1986.
   ``The Marcoses will find that American justice cannot be trifled
with as Marcos trifled with justice,'' columnist Vicente Albano
Pacis wrote in the Philippine Daily Inquirer.
   Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus disclosed to reporters Wednesday
that the United States asked Manila two months ago to waive immunity
for Marcos as a former head of state. ``The government gave
permission,'' Manglapus said.
   Malaya, another daily, noted the Reagan administration strongly
supported Marcos until the final days of his 20-year rule. The
indictment should serve as a warning to President Corazon Aquino, it
said.
   ``They (Americans) have the power over the fate of other
governments like the Marcoses' and presumably that of Mrs. Aquino,
the big brother who can discipline, punish or destroy anybody who
becomes a threat to them or their interests,'' the paper said.
   Columnist Ninez Cacho-Olivares wrote in the newspaper
BusinessWorld that the boos and catcalls hurled at Mrs. Marcos
outside a federal court in New York were reminiscent of ``old,
barbaric days of the Romans.''
   ``Today, the American media make fun of her,'' she wrote. ``But
where were the indignant crowds in 1972? ... The American media as
well as American officials were in the early days all praise for
Marcos and his wife Imelda.''

   Dissident and Nobel laureate Andrei Sakharov
reportedly is expected to arrive in Boston on Sunday for his first
trip outside the Soviet Union.
   The two-week visit to the United States may include a stay at
Massachusetts General Hospital to be examined for possible
implantation of a pacemaker, the Boston Globe said today, citing
unidentified sources.
   Two of Sakharov's stepchildren live in Boston suburbs.
   The 67-year-old physicist is credited with developing the Soviet
Union's hydrogen bomb. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975
for defending human rights.
   Sakharov was banished to internal exile in Gorky, about 250 miles
from Moscow, in 1980. His wife, Yelena Bonner, was banished there in
1984.
   They were released in 1986 by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev,
and the recent announcement that Sakharov would be allowed to travel
to the United States was seen as another sign of Gorbachev's easing
of restrictions on human rights.
   Sakharov's trip is to promote the newly formed International
Foundation for the Survival and Development of Humanity, the first
private foundation allowed to operate with full legal status in the
Soviet Union.

   Here are some facts and figures on the Maldives.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ Almost all of the country's 182,000 people are Sunni
Moslems, the mainstream sect of Islam. The Maldivians were once
Buddhists but converted to Islam in the 12th century. Today Islam is
the state religion, and liquor is forbidden except on islands
reserved for foreign tourists. The people are descendants of Veddas,
Sinhalese and Dravadians from India and Sri Lanka, and Arab and
Negro settlers. The official language is Divehi, an ancient form of
the Sinhalese spoken today in Sri Lanka, but English is widely used.
The literacy rate is 83 percent, one of the highest in South Asia.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ The nation is an archipelago of about 1,200 coral
islands and about 800 islets in the Indian Ocean. Only 210 of the
islands are inhabited. The country lies 500 miles southwest of Sri
Lanka and about the same distance south of India. The islands lie
close to the oil tanker shipping lanes from the Persian Gulf. The
nation is 175 square miles, and the total area including lagoons is
20,000 square miles. Most of the islands are less than a mile long.
Only two islands are three miles long.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE HISTORY _ The Maldives was a hereditary sultanate until 1968
when it was declared a republic. The islands were under British
colonial rule from 1887 until independence in 1965. In 1968, Sultan
Ahmed Farid Didi was replaced as leader by his prime minister,
Ibrahim Nasir, who subsequently was named president. In 1978 Nasir
surprised his countrymen with an announcement that he would retire
after 21 years as prime minister or president. Maumoon Abdul Gayoom
was elected to succeed Nasir and was re-elected in 1983and 1988.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE GOVERNMENT _ The president is the head of state and is
elected by universal suffrage every five years. Gayoom has sought to
steer policy of non-alignment with the superpowers. As transport
minister before becoming president, he led a successful campaign to
prevent the Soviet Union from leasing an old British air base in the
Maldives.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ Fishing accounts for 23 percent of the gross
domestic product, while tourism accounts for 17 percent. Coconut,
millet and fruits are grown. Per capita income is $475 a year.

<HEAD>Iran Charges Iraq Using POW Issue To Delay Withdrawal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran today accused Iraq of using humanitarian
issues to delay withdrawing its troops from Iranian territory and
said all war prisoners could have been repatriated by next week if
Iraq had cooperated.
   Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, was reacting to
Iraqi allegations that Iran was delaying the exchange of prisoners
of war.
   Iraq has offered to release its more than 30,000 prisoners if
Iran would do the same. The two sides have been at war since
September 1980.
   In refusing to accept an immediate exchange of prisoners, Iran
said it already has agreed in principle to a U.N. proposal that
links the prisoner exchange to military disengagement.
   Velayati said that because of continued Iraqi occupation of
Iranian territory, hundreds of thousands of Iranians continue to be
homeless. He spoke to reporters after meeting with the president of
the International Committee of the Red Cross, Cornelio Sommaruga.
   Velayati renewed Iran's offer to release immediately all sick and
wounded prisoners as well as civilian detainees ``on a reciprocal
basis.''
   A U.N. cease-fire resolution calls for the countries to withdraw
forces ``to internationally recognized boundaries without delay.''
Dispute over the definition of their common border has been stalling
peace talks, which began Aug. 25.
   Iran claims that 400 square miles of Iranian territory are still
occupied by Iraqi forces.
   ``It is indeed regrettable that Iraq has turned the humanitarian
issue into a diplomatic tool to cover up and prolong its occupation
of Iranian territory,'' Velayati said in a prepared statement.
   ``Had Iraq accepted the original timetable for implementation of
resolution 598, all POWs would have been released and repatriated by
this coming Tuesday,'' he said.
   Iraq claims that Iraqi territory of unspecified size is held by
the Iranians.

   Four men, including incumbent Thomas O.

president.
   With 13.5 percent of Wednesday's vote counted, two state
governors, Roman Tmetuchl and Ngiratkel Etpison, held slim leads
over Remengesau and traditional High Chief Yutaka M. Gibbons.
   Three other candidates in the field of seven, the largest number
to seek the office since constitutional government was adopted eight
years ago, lagged far behind.
   Election officials said 8,000 votes remained to be counted in
Palau, with some 600 absentee ballots expected from Guam, Hawaii and
Saipan.
   After 14 hours of hand counting 1,501 paper ballots, the
unofficial totals among the top four vote-getters were: Tmetuchl,
428, or 28.5 percent; Etpison, 364, 24.2 percent; Gibbons, 246, 16.4
percent, and Remengesau, 196, 13 percent.
   Remengesau, 55, has been in office less than three months. He is
filling out the unexpired term of Lazarus Salii, who died Aug. 20
from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. This is
Remengesau's first run for the presidency.
   Tmetuchl, 62, a wealthy businessman, and Gibbons, 44, were
unsuccessful candidates for president in 1980 and 1984, both of
which were won by Jaruo I. Remeliik. Salii succeeded Remeliik, who
was assassinated in 1985.
   Epitson, 63, a wealthy businessman, is making his first run at
national office.
   Palau, a string of tiny, isolated islands 600 miles east of the
Philippines and 4,500 miles southwest of Hawaii, is the world's
largest trusteeship, established in 1947 by the United Nations. The
United States administers its affairs.

   Leaders of the National Religious Party today
ruled out a coalition with the left-leaning Labor Party and said
they preferred joining a government headed by the right-wing Likud
bloc.
   The move by the five-seat party boosted Likud's chances of
forming a government without Labor, its main rival. Likud took a
narrow victory in Tuesday's parliamentary elections over Labor,
which today appeared increasingly pessimistic over its chances of
forming a government.
   Labor sources today said party officials are considering ousting
Shimon Peres as its leader because of the party's poor showing.
   Labor and Likud need the support of the religious parties,
kingmakers despite their small size, to control a majority of seats
in parliament. The right-oriented Orthodox parties advocate banning
practices favored by Israel's secular majority.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, the Likud leader, today opened
coalition talks with two secular right-wing parties.
   The Tzomet (Crossroads) and Moledet (Homeland) parties, which
each won two seats, call for the annexation of the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip. Moledet also demands the ouster of the 1.5
million Palestinians living in the occupied lands, a policy its
refers to as ``transfer.''
   Likud officials have said Moledet's expulsion platform could be
an obstacle to it joining a Likud-led coalition.
   The Moledat leader, former Gen. Rehavam Zeevi, said after meeting
with Shamir and other Likud leaders that he would not insist that
``transfer'' be adopted as government policy if the party joined the
government.
   ``There is a 99.9 percent chance for a Likud-led government,''
Zeevi told reporters.
   Peres, the foreign minister, met today with Labor's leftist
allies Mapam, which won three seats; the Citizens' Rights Movement,
which won five; and Shinui which won two.
   Likud and parties to the right won 46 seats while Labor and
parties to the left won 48, fewer than the 61 needed to form a
government. The Orthodox religious parties won 18 seats, an increase
of four.
   The Orthodox community in Israel has been growing steadily
because of a high birthrate and immigration.
   In contrast, the number of secular Israelis, always a large
majority, has been dropping steadily because of a lower birthrate
and emigration.
   Likud leaders said the Orthodox parties had an affinity for the
Likud.
   ``We all feel clearly that we should go (into the government)
together,'' Cabinet minister Moshe Katzav of Likud's negotiating
team said after talks with religious leaders.
   Leaders of the National Religious Party said they ruled out
joining a Labor-led coalition after disagreeing with Labor on
foreign policy issues Wednesday. The religious party supports
annexing the territories and increasing Jewish settlements, and
opposes Labor's plan to hold peace talks with Arab states within an
international conference.
   ``It looks like talks with the Labor have collapsed,'' Cabinet
minister Yosef Shapiro of National Religious Party told Israel
radio, adding that the party was much closer to Likud.
   ``I don't think there's a wide basis for continuing talks,''
agreed Rafi Edri, a member of Labor negotiating team.
   The Orthodox are demanding a long list of religious legislation
including an amendment to the ``Who Is a Jew'' law stipulating that
only Orthodox rabbis may convert non-Jews. The small religious
parties have often battled with the Israeli's secular majority
during the state's 40-year history.
   Avraham Shapira, a legislator for Agudat Israel, told Israel
Television his party would ban movies and soccer games on the Jewish
Sabbath, from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday.
   The issue of films and soccer games on the Sabbath has been a
source of great tension among religious and secular Israelis,
provoking clashes outside movie houses last year.
   During the election campaign, Labor pledged to oppose changing
the ``Who Is a Jew'' law because it would undermine the status of
thousands of people in the United States and other countries who
were converted to Judaism by Conservative or Reform rabbis.
   Likud is not saying how far it is willing to go in embracing
Orthodox demands. But it has in the past said it would support the
amendment to the ``Who Is a Jew'' law.
   Likud governed the last four years with the leftist Labor Party
in an uneasy coalition, but both sides indicate no such
power-sharing is now in the offing. Palestinian leaders have sharply
condemned the election outcome.
   More than 300 Palestinians and 10 Israelis have died in the
nearly 11-month-old uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied
lands.

<HEAD>Firebomb Destroys Monument Recalling Nazi Terror</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A firebomb thrown by a young man riding a
bicycle today destroyed a controversial monument built by a
German-American sculptor to recall Nazi terror in the southern
Austrian city of Graz, police said.
   Local radio and newspaper reporters said the wooden monument, put
up in the city center three weeks ago for an exhibition, has been
defaced before.
   Graz was a Nazi stronghold when Austria was incorporated into
Adolf Hitler's Third Reich in 1938.
   The obelisk by German-American sculptor Hans Haacke was built
around a pillar honoring the Virgin Mary.
   The wooden obelisk, covered with a cloth bearing the Nazi eagle
emblem, recalled a ``pillar of victory'' put up by the Nazis in 1938
near the Virgin Mary pillar. Unlike the Nazi monument, Haacke's
structure had at its foot a list of the number of Jews, gypsies,
prisoners and political opponents murdered by the Nazis in Styria
province, of which Graz is the capital.
   Previous attacks on the monument prompted city authorities to
guard the monument at night, police said. But the guard failed to
stop the pre-dawn firebomb attack. A young cyclist was seen racing
from the scene after he hurled the firebomb at the structure,
setting it afire.
   Police said the monument was destroyed, and some damage spread to
the pillar honoring the Virgin Mary.
   Peter Vujica, director of the ``Styrian Autumn'' arts festival
for which the monument was built, told Austrian radio the attack was
``regrettable.''
   ``There is some kind of crisis of confidence in a town when a
memorial becomes an object of shame,'' Vujica said. ``But I hope
Graz will not get the label `Nazi city' again. It isn't.''

   Crowds chanted ``Solidarity! Solidarity!''
today while British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher laid a wreath
at the grave of a pro-Solidarity priest who was slain by state
police.
   The ceremony, on the second day of an official visit, marked the
British leader's most open demonstration of sympathy toward
opponents of Poland's communist government. Immediately afterward,
she began her first meeting with the Communist Party chief, Gen.
Wojciech Jaruzelski.
   Earlier, Mrs. Thatcher met with Poland's prime minister but did
not respond to his appeal for Western aid to help Poland's economy,
an aide said.
   Mrs. Thatcher's silence apparently reflected her cool response to
general suggestions, initiated by West Germany last month, that West
European governments give unconditional aid.
   The wreath-laying came during a hectic day of official talks and
sightseeing. Mrs. Thatcher's three-day visit is the first by a
British prime minister to this Soviet bloc country.
   About 2,000 people packed the graveside near the St. Stanislaw
Kostka Roman Catholic Church. The church is a stronghold of the
banned Solidarity trade union federation and the parish of the Rev.
Jerzy Popieluszko. He was slain in 1984 by four secret policemen who
were later imprisoned.
   Their hands raised in a V-for-victory sign, the Solidarity
salute, the crowd broke into a traditional hymn, ``God Watches Over
Poland,'' after Mrs. Thatcher placed the wreath of roses, lilies and
irises on the tombstone.
   She also spoke with Popieluszko's parents, Marianne and Wladyslaw.
   ``We are extremely grateful that she found the time to come
here,'' said Mrs. Popieluszko. ``We know that deep in her heart she
has been with our beloved son. We know she supports people suffering
in Poland.''
   Church stewards held Solidarity banners. A giant red-and-white
banner hung from the church railings declared, ``Solidarity was and
will be.''
   Since her arrival Wednesday, Mrs. Thatcher has been greeted
warmly by Poles. Security police shoved back crowds who thronged
Mrs. Thatcher while she toured a market of state-owned stalls today.
   Shoppers reached out and kissed her hand, a teen-ager pushed an
autograph book at her, and several women wept with emotion as
hundreds in the market cried ``Bravo!'' and ``Maggie, Maggie,
Maggie!''
   Earlier, Mrs. Thatcher met with Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F.
Rakowski. A British official said Rakowski complained that Poland's
$39 billion foreign debt is ``like a noose round our necks'' and
appealed for Western help.
   ``The prime minister did not respond,'' said the official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. The prime ministers also met
Wednesday.
   The British view is that the International Monetary Fund _ to
which Poland has appealed _ and the Paris Club of leading Western
creditor nations should decide on debt rescheduling and other aid
and make it strictly conditional on austerity package of economic
reform.
   Before meeting Rakowski, Mrs. Thatcher went to Warsaw's Victory
Square and laid a wreath on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. A small
crowd watched in icy temperatures in light snow.
   She later watched an emotional film of the Nazi invaders razing
Warsaw during World War II in reprisal for a popular uprising.
   On Wednesday, Jarulzelski issued a veiled warning to the British
leader not to interfere in Poland's tense politics.
   ``I hope Mrs. Thatcher will allow us to tackle our own problems
in a sovereign way, using our own methods and instruments,'' he said
in a British television interview.
   It was the first official warning to the Conservative Party prime
minister, hailed by Polish government leaders for her rigorous
economic policies and by Solidarity for her anti-communist views.
   In the Baltic port of Gdansk, where Mrs. Thatcher planned to
travel Friday for a meeting with Solidarity leader Lech Walesa,
nearly the entire 10,000-member workforce of the Lenin Shipyard
rallied Wednesday.
   The workers vowed to fight the government's decision to close the
yard where Solidarity was born during a 1980 strike wave.
   Mrs. Thatcher will be the first Western leader to make the trip
to meet Walesa at his headquarters in Gdansk.
   The government said Monday it planned to close the Lenin Shipyard
on Dec. 1 for economic reasons, though Walesa called the move an
attempt to weaken Solidarity. The yard would be the first large
enterprise shut down in a new goverment attempt to revive a limping
economy.

<HEAD>Amended Lawsuit Filed In Baby Swap Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WAUCHULA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Pennsylvania couple who claim they lost
their daughter in a hospital baby-swap 10 years ago now say they
won't necessarily seek custody of the Florida girl they believe is
theirs, their lawyer says.
   In an amended lawsuit filed Wednesday in state court, Ernest and
Regina Twigg of Langhorne, Pa., said they still want a judge to
order a genetic test to determine the biological parents of
9-year-old Kimberly Mays of Sarasota.
   The suit omits a previous contention that the child lacks a
stable home life. The girl lives with her father, Robert W. Mays.
Her mother is dead.
   Because of the amended lawsuit, a hearing set for Friday on the
original request for a blood sample from the girl was postponed. No
new date was set.
   The amended suit will streamline the proceedings, according to
John Blakely and William Post, attorneys for the Twiggs.
   ``We did not make any allegations that we felt were unnecessary''
for the judge to decide whether or not to order the genetic test,
Blakely said.
   The original suit, filed in October, said the Twiggs would seek
custody of Kimberly if she proved to be their biological daughter.
   But Blakely said Wednesday that the Twiggs want to find the girl
first and then investigate her lifestyle before deciding, on the
basis of what they believe is the child's best interest, whether to
seek custody.
   Mays last month insisted he is Kimberly's real father and will
not give up the child under any circumstances.
   The Twiggs filed a $100 million federal lawsuit in September
against Hardee Memorial Hospital, three doctors and a nurse,
alleging their healthy daughter was switched shortly after birth
with a child with a heart defect.
   The child raised by the Twiggs, named Arlena, died in August. A
genetic test conducted in the summer proved she was unrelated to
either Twigg.

   Student drug dealers in the city's schools will
no longer be able to receive messages on their beepers.
   Schools Chancellor Richard R. Green said Wednesday that all
beepers would be confiscated beginning this week but that no other
penalty would be imposed.
   Several other big-city districts, including Baltimore and
Detroit, have also curbed or banned student use of the devices.
   ``Telephone paging devices, known as beepers, are often used in
connection with drug trafficking and drug sales,'' Green said in a
memo to the Board of Education.
   The board's safety office issued a directive two years ago
instructing its security staffs to bring any student with a beeper
to the principal's office to find out why the student had it.
Green's memo said it was time to expand that directive.
   Victor Herbert, head of the board's high school division, said
many high schools already had banned beepers, some as long as three
years ago.

   A bus collided with a truck on a fog-bound
stretch of the Istanbul-Ankara highway today, killing 29 passengers,
including a Japanese and 10 Iranians, authorities said.
   The 18 other victims were Turks, and two Iranians and eight Turks
were injured, said Sakarya prosecutor Ercivan Tumay, who is in
charge of the case.
   The semi-official Anatolia news agency earlier had put the death
toll at 26, saying most of the victims were Japanese and Iranian.
   Tumay said in a telephone interview that the accident occurred
when two trucks were trying to pass on the highway about 6 a.m.
   The bus was headed for Istanbul. The trip began Wednesday in the
eastern city of Erzurum near the Iranian border, Tumay said.

<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush branded as ``grossly
unfair and untrue'' today suggestions that his campaign tactics were
racially motivated, and rejected attacks on running mate Dan
Quayle's civil rights record.
   The vice president vowed during an interview on NBC-TV's
``Today'' show to ``leave the tired baggage of bigotry behind.''
   Bush heatedly denied that his relentless attacks on Democratic
rival Michael Dukakis over the Massachusetts prison furlough program
had racist overtones in citing the case of Willie Horton Jr., a
convicted black murderer who escaped from a 1986 furlough and raped
a white Maryland woman.
   ``There is no bigotry,'' the GOP nominee said in the live
half-hour interview. ``I oppose that furlough program ...''
   ``But to go out as my opponent did ... and try to assign me
something that is not in my heart, this charge of racism, is grossly
unfair and untrue,'' Bush said.
   Bush did not directly challenge interviewer Bryant Gumbel's
statement that Quayle's civil rights record was ``terrible.''
   Gumbel asked Bush whether voters would be getting the Bush who
supported early civil rights legislation in Congress or the one who
selected Quayle, ``who has a terrible civil rights record.''
   ``You're going to get both,'' Bush said, ``because I stand by my
record on Dan Quayle and I don't like these attacks on his integrity
or his civil rights or anything else.''
   Bush called himself a man who ```was out front for civil rights
and I will be again.''
   He added: ``I don't have one ounce of bigotry in my body, nor
does my running mate.''
   The vice president said that ``even though a lot of civil rights
leaders automatically endorse whoever the Democratic candidate is, I
think most of them know in their hearts that I am a decent,
honorable person who cares about race relations and will leave the
tired baggage of bigotry behind.''
   On the economy, Bush said spurring economic growth was his answer
to reducing the federal budget deficit and fulfilling his promises
to boost spending for some government programs without cutting
defense outlays or raising taxes.
   Speaking two days after the government reported another sluggish
performance by the econoy in September, the vice president said his
proposals would be made possible by future economic growth at a 2.8
percent rate. ``I hope it will grow at even more, and if it does
you've got tremendous revenues coming into the federal government,''
he said.
   Later, addressing a rally in downtown Columbus before he flew to
Chicago, the GOP nominee said he was discounting the polls and
political pundits ``who are telling us what we think.'' He said
``it's the people who will decide'' the outcome of next Tuesday's
balloting.
   As national polls showed him holding onto a double-digit lead
over the Massachusetts governor, a hoarse-voiced and buoyant Bush
insisted Wednesday that he was campaigning all-out until the
election.
   ``Ys things look pretty good nationwide, but I'm going to
out-hustle that liberal governor,'' he told a high school rally in
Lansing.
   The rest of his schedule today called for rallies in Illinois,
Ohio and New Jersey, all significant electoral-vote states where the
race is close.
   Press Secretary Sheila Tate said the campaign was keeping its
strategy options open but for the most part Bush will hold a series
of rallies in battleground states, and will stress some of the
themes that he outlined in a wide-ranging speech Tuesday at Notre
Dame University.
   On Friday, the campaign will begin airing two new commercials
nationwide _ both positive spots rather than attack ads _ with Bush
talking about ``the reasons he's running for president,'' said
campaign manager Lee Atwater.
   On Wednesday, Bush stumped in Illinois and Michigan at three
raucus rallies, two of them at high schools. Illinois has 24
electoral votes, Michigan 20.
   Bush stole Dukakis' ``On your side'' slogan when he talked about
differences between himself and the Democrat.
   At the rally at Lansing Catholic Central High School, Bush told
the students to tell their parents ``George Bush is on your side of
the Great Divide.''
   Bush said the differences between him and Dukakis ``are as deep
and wide as the Great Divide,'' another term for the mountain
watershed known as the Continental Divide.
   ``And I represent the mainstream, the mainstream views, the
mainstream values, and they are your values and my values and the
values and values of the vast majority of the American people,''
Bush told a rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., where he was introduced by
former President Gerald Ford.
   ``If I win the election, it will be a mainstream mandate,'' he
said.
   Despite his consistent lead in the polls, Bush tells each
audience that he is running like he's 10 points behind.

   French President Francois Mitterrand
arrived in Bonn today for two days of talks with West German leaders
expected to focus on forging a joint diplomatic policy toward the
Soviet bloc.
   After Mitterrand's plane landed at Cologne-Bonn Airport, he left
for the federal chancellery in Bonn for talks with Chancellor Helmut
Kohl.
   He was also slated to meet with President Richard von Weizsaecker
and attend a dinner being held in his honor at Schaumburg Palace in
Bonn.
   During their talks, Kohl and Mitterrand were to discuss a wide
range of topics, including initiatives toward more European economic
cooperation and joint diplomatic efforts with the Soviet bloc.
   Kohl was also expected to brief Mitterrand on his recent talks
with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other Kremlin
officials. Relations with Moscow and a common policy toward the
Soviet Union were to top the agenda for the 52nd French-German
summit, according to West German officials.
   Kohl visited Moscow last month for wide-ranging talks with
Gorbachev. Mitterrand is scheduled to visit Moscow later this month.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frank Naylor will resign as chairman of the
Farm Credit Administration effective Nov. 10, an agency spokesman
said today.
   The 49-year-old Naylor plans to announce at a luncheon Friday his
departure from the regulatory agency to join a newly formed
Washington consulting company, Agri-Credit Inc., spokesman Bill
Hendrix said.
   Naylor was named to head the Farm Credit Administration in May
1986 when the Farm Credit System was in the throes of fearsome
financial crisis that saw $4.8 billion in loans turn sour in just
one year.
   The money crisis that swept over rural America in the 1980s has
frequently been pinpointed as the culprit, along with slack
management that locked the system into high overhead and capital
costs.
   Since then, the network has returned to the black and regained a
measure of stability, in part because of legislation that opened the
door to an overhaul of the system and provided it with a $4 billion
line of credit with the federal Treasury.
   But the system of 24 major banks and more than 1,000 local
lending institutions, a bulwark of U.S. agriculture since its
founding in 1912, has shrunk from a loan portfolio of $80 billion to
one of $50 billion. The $2 billion Federal Land Bank in Jackson,
Miss., closed because of insolvency.
   Naylor has been an official in four Republican administrations.
During the Carter administration, he held a position at the
Sacramento, Calif., Federal Land Bank.
   He was appointed by President Reagan as head of the Farm Credit
Administration's three-member board after a stint as undersecretary
of agriculture for small community and rural development, a post
that placed him in charge of the Farmers Home Administration.
   He represented the Reagan administration when Congress drew up
1985 legislation that tightened federal regulation of the Farm
Credit System and transformed the Farm Credit Administration from a
sort of unofficial lobbying agency for the system into an
arm's-length regulator.
   More extensive legislation approved in 1987 has spawned a
so-called ``Farmer Mac'' secondary market in farm real estate loans
under which banks and insurance companies are able to sell debt to
investors.
   Hendrix said U.S. Agri-Credit would provide training, consulting
and other services to commercial bankers interested in entering the
secondary market.

   Avtex Fibers Inc. today began closing its
plant today as the government worked to avert the shutdown of the
sole supplier of rayon yarn used in space shuttle rocket nozzles.
   Morton Thiokol Inc., the maker of space shuttle motors, said
Avtex had produced enough of the yarn for the next 10 shuttle
launches.
   ``Employees are being released from their jobs as their jobs are
completed,'' Avtex spokesman Nick Nichols said from Washington.
``People will be working for the next couple of days to shut it down
and secure it.
   ``Production, for all intents and purposes, is stopping today. By
midnight tonight, production will cease,'' he said.
   Morton Thiokol was talking today with Avtex, as were NASA, the
Pentagon and other contractors, in hopes of finding a way for
production to continue uninterrupted. No details were available on
the talks today.
   Avtex, based in Valley Forge, Pa., announced this week it was
closing its plant here today, idling 1,300 workers. It said it
suffered big losses because of the Challenger disaster, which
grounded shuttle flights for 2{ years.
   On Wednesday, Morton Thiokol said it had determined enough of the
fiber was already made for shuttle launches through December 1989.
   ``We have enough material on hand or on order for 11 flights out
of our current contract of 13,'' said Rocky Raab, a Morton Thiokol
spokesman in Ogden, Utah. ``But the number will be 10 now, since
we've flown Discovery.''
   But the spokesman could not say how much of the fiber was
available for numerous military rockets the compnay produces,
including the small ICBM, the MX missile and the HARM and Standard
tactical missiles.
   ``Practically every project we have uses it in the nozzle,'' Raab
said. ``It's safe to say billions of dollars of projects.''
   Once Avtex makes the fiber, it is processed by three further
layers of contractors who weave it and treat it to make it
heat-resistant before rocket makers assemble it into nozzles.
   Avtex chairman John Gregg did not immediately return telephone
queries about the progress of his company's talks with the
government.
   ``I really don't know what the discussions are leading to,'' said
Dave Drachlis, a spokesman at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in
Huntsville, Ala. ``I know the government and Avtex are discussing
options and looking at what could be done.''
   Neither contractors nor the government could say how long it
would take to certify another manufacturer for the fiber if that
were necessary.
   Avtex spokesman John Kelly in New York said the company could
continue production only at the Front Royal plant. Avtex's other
plant, in Lewistown, Pa., lacks the equipment, and the machinery in
Front Royal cannot be moved, he said.
   Cheap imports and environmental problems had taken their toll for
years on Avtex, Front Royal's dominant employer.
   On Wednesday, Avtex was hit by a $19.68 million lawsuit in which
Virginia Attorney General Mary Sue Terry alleged the plant violated
state water discharge levels 1,968 times over the past eight years.

   Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis,
declaring he is ``sprinting for the finish line'' in the
presidential election, proposed today a federal, state and local
alliance to combat drug use in the nation's schools.
   At a town meeting at Pennsbury High School in Bucks County,
Dukakis said his proposed alliance ``will set for its goal drug-free
schools in the 1990s in every community in the United States.''
   Earlier, in an interview on the ``CBS This Morning'' television
show, the Massachusetts governor insisted that up to 30 percent of
the voters remain undecided with only five days remaining until
Election Day.
   In an effort to overtake Republican presidential rival George
Bush, Dukakis has focused heavily on combating drugs.
   He lambasted Bush on Wednesday for saying he would not
automatically cut off foreign aid to nations that fail to cooperate
with U.S. efforts to stem the flow of illegal drugs.
   Dukakis shifted the focus today to the need for comprehensive
measures to discourage drug use, especially among young people.
   He outlined a program that would include drug education starting
in kindergarten and creation of community advisory councils to
coordinate local efforts.
   The Democratic nominee said he would advocate making such
councils ``permanent, not just something to do this year.'' They
would include educators, parents, children and leaders of business,
sports and the media.
   He also called for special grants targeting ``high-risk kids and
high-risk communities.''
   A fact sheet distributed by Dukakis aides said the program would
have a federal commitment of $400 million.
   In his TV interview earlier today, Dukakis claimed that ``we are
either tied or moving ahead'' in the major states essential to his
hopes of scoring an upset victory over Bush.
   That assessment is contradicted by many public opinion polls
which suggest that Dukakis still has a lot of ground to make up.
   On his 55th birthday, the Massachusetts governor was hammering
away at Bush on the issue of drugs which he said marked a clear
difference between him and Bush.
   As for the tougher tone of his rhetoric, Dukakis said he had been
``a little too restrained, perhaps,'' earlier in the campaign.
   Voters are ``taking a very strong second look at me,'' he said.
   Dukakis often has compared the presidential campaign to a
marathon race. ``This one is going to go down to the wire,'' he said
today. ``... We're sprinting for the finish line and we hope and
expect that we're going to win.''
   At rallies Wednesday in Chicago and Philadelphia, Dukakis quoted
Bush as saying he wouldn't strip U.S. foreign aid from countries
that refused to cooperate in efforts to stem the flow of drugs.
   ``I'll be damned if I'll let those countries send their poison
into the United States of America,'' he said, using unusually strong
language.
   ``I'll say to foreign leaders, if you're prepared to work with
us, we'll work with you,'' he went on to the cheers of partisan
crowds. ``But if you're against us don't expect a dime from American
foreign aid.''
   Bush spokesman Mark Goodin, responding to Dukakis' comments, said
the Democratic nominee has distorted the GOP nominee's position on
the issue.
   ``The vice president would never hesitate to use aid as a lever
on the war on drugs,'' Goodin said.
   Dukakis also returned to two of his favorite themes, the link
between Bush and Panamanian ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega and Bush's
plan to put his vice president, Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle, in charge
of the war on drugs.
   The Democratic candidate said he would tell foreign leaders, ``If
you think you can do to Mike Dukakis what Noriega did to George
Bush, if you think we're going to risk our children's lives by
putting somebody like Dan Quayle in charge of the war against drugs,
then you're in for a big surprise on January 20, 1989.''
   After a rally in Pittsburgh, Dukakis told reporters, that Bush
was offering people ``a lot of talk and very little action.''
   ``I don't think Mr. Bush is serious about the war against
drugs,'' he said.
   At nearly every stop for two days, crowds sang ``Happy Birthday''
to the candidate who turned 55 today.
   His wife, Kitty, had planned to be with him for his birthday, but
she was hospitalized in Minneapolis, recovering from a respiratory
infection. Aides said she hoped to join him on Friday in Chicago.
   With time running out for his campaign, Dukakis was dogged by
national polls released earlier this week showing him trailing Bush
by up to 13 points.
   Dukakis told crowds to ignore the polls and encouraged them by
saying that ``this is one election where millions of people are
going to be looking and thinking and listening and they're not going
to be making up their mind until very close to the moment when they
go into that polling booth.''

   Michael Dukakis, contending he's catching up in major states,
said today he's ready for a dash to the finish line as voters take
``a very strong second look at me.'' Front-runner George Bush
defended his campaign against suggestions of racism.
   Five days from the election, the Democratic governor of
Massachusetts and the Republican vice president took advantage of
invitations to appear on morning network television programs to
press their cases.
   On NBC's ``Today,'' Bush was asked about Democratic suggestions
that his campaign had a racist tinge in that his speeches and
commercials have emphasized the case of a black Massachusetts
convict who escaped while on furlough and attacked a Maryland couple.
   ``There is no bigotry,'' Bush said. ``I oppose that furlough
program ... but to go out as my opponent did ... and try to assign
me something that is not in my heart, this charge of racism, is
grossly unfair and untrue.''
   ``I don't have one ounce of bigotry in my body, nor does my
running mate,'' he said. ``Even though a lot of civil rights leaders
automatically endorse whoever the Democraitc candidate is, I think
most of them know in their hearts that I am a decent honorable
person who cares about race relations and will leave the tired
baggage of bigotry behind.''
   Dukakis, in an interview on ``CBS This Morning,'' shrugged off
national polls showing him well behind, saying that ``we are either
tied or moving ahead'' in major states he needs to score an upset
victory.
   He said 20 percent to 30 percent of voters have not finally
decided for whom to vote, and he contended that as decision time
nears they ``are taking a very strong second look at me.''
   Dukakis, celebrating his 55th birthday today, said, ``This one is
going to go down to the wire. ... We're sprinting for the finish
line and we hope and expect that we're going to win.''
   Later, in Fairless Hills, Pa., Dukakis outlined a proposal for a
federal, state and local alliance to combat drug use in the nation's
schools.
   At a town meeting in Pennsbury High School, he said his
President's Alliance Against Drugs ``will set for its goal drug-free
schools in the 1990s in every community in the United States.''
   He called for community advisory councils to coordinate local
efforts, including educators, parents, children, business, sports
and media leaders, with special grants targeting ``high-risk kids
and high-risk communities.''
   With the race for the White House down to less than a week, the
campaigns were bringing out their final TV ads, including one in
which President Reagan asks viewers to ``vote Republican up and down
the ticket to continue the change we began in 1981.''
   The Democrats contend in a new ad that they are the party of
average working people while under the Republicans millions of U.S.
jobs were ``shipped to workers overseas.''
   Dukakis, in Chicago on Wednesday, assailed the Republicans'
recent claim on Harry Truman's memory. ``Have they no shame?'' he
asked.
   With Democrat Dukakis taking full advantage of national
television interview invitations, Bush tossed another barb loaded
with ``the L word,'' or liberal label.
   ``It seemed like he appeared on every television show except
`Wheel of Fortune,''' Bush joked. ``You see, he was afraid that
Vanna might turn over the L word.'' Vanna White is hostess on the
popular game show.
   Still, Dukakis' television apperances prompted Bush to accept
several of his own, including 30 minutes live on NBC's ``Today''
show today.
   The campaign grew more heated for the vice presidential
candidates. Democrat Lloyd Bentsen blasted Bush for selecting Dan
Quayle as his running mate. The choice, Bentsen said in Illinois,
showed ``a real disdain, disregard for our country.''
   Quayle found himself caught up anew in a controversy over
abortion.
   While he ardently opposes abortion, even in cases of rape, Quayle
told questioners he had no quarrel with a medical procedure known as
dilation and curettage, or D-and-C, and said it would prevent
conception if performed soon after rape.
   The medical procedure is considered by many in the field of
gynecology as a means of terminating a pregnancy.
   Questions about abortion have hounded Quayle in recent days,
particularly following his suggestion to a 12-year-old girl that she
should go ahead and give birth in a theoretical situation in which
she was raped by her father and became pregnant.
   Dukakis, with fatigue from his frenetic pace showing in his
voice, campaigned with Jesse Jackson in Philadelphia late Wednesday
night where the former Democratic candidate received a rousing
reception.
   Dukakis, introduced by Jackson, sparked the crowd at Martin
Luther King High School when he stressed his anti-apartheid theme.
   ``Nelson Mandela is still in jail and Manuel Noriega is still
running Panama. It's time that changed,'' Dukakis said.
   He earlier unleashed some of his harshest rhetoric yet, blasting
Bush for anti-drug efforts and saying a day before that he would not
necessarily halt aid to nations that refuse to cooperate with U.S.
anti-drug effort.
   ``If you're against us, don't expect a dime of American foreign
aid,'' Dukakis said.
   ``I'll work with other countries, but I'll be damned if I will
allow those countries to send their poison into the United States of
America,'' Dukakis said. ``Maybe (Bush) thinks there are other
things more important than the future of our children. ... I say you
have to draw the line somewhere.''
   Bush spokesman Mark Goodin, responding to Dukakis' comments, said
the Democratic nominee has distorted the GOP nominee's position on
the issue.
   ``The vice president would never hesitate to use aid as a lever
on the war on drugs,'' Goodin said.

   A police recruit who collapsed from heat stroke and
dehydration Sept. 19 on the first day of boot camp-like training at
an academy in Agawam has died, officials said today.
   Timothy M. Shepard, 25, of Pittsfield died late Wednesday, said
Susan Ruth, a spokeswoman for Presbyterian-University Hospital in
Pittsburgh. At the family's request, the hospital withheld word of
his death until today.
   The cause of death awaited a coroner's report, Ms. Ruth said.
   Shepard was the sickest of the 16 cadets in a class of 50 who
were hospitalized with exhaustion and dehydration following a
grueling regimen of pushups, confusion drills and punishment laps
under the direction of State Police drill instructors. Ten other
cadets also suffered kidney ailments.
   Attorney General James Shannon today called for an inquest into
Shepard's death, saying the family is entitled to a full explanation
of his death.
   The Pittsfield Police Department recruit had lapsed back into a
coma and underwent surgery for a blood clot on the brain Monday,
five weeks after undergoing a liver transplant.
   ``The family is obviously devastated. He came so close to making
it,'' said Michael D. Hashim, the lawyer for the Shepard family.
   Hashim called for the indictment of two State Police officers at
the academy, saying the death was ``a clear-cut case of involuntary
manslaughter.'' Last month, Shannon investigated the program and
declined to bring charges.
   The director of the state Criminal Justice Training Council
resigned Wednesday and his replacement immediately abolished the
grueling training.
   ``We can never allow what happened at Agawam to happen again,''
said Peter W. Agnes Jr., who was appointed interim director upon the
resignation of Gary F. Egan.
   The program's ``modified stress training'' combines constant
exercise and unexpected situations during training and was partially
blamed for the dehydration suffered by cadets that led to the
illnesses.
   Shannon investigated after cadets reported they were pushed to
the limits of their endurance with hours of laps, pushups and other
exercises the first day of class on just a few small cups of water.
   He found the training was a ``massive failure'' that was to blame
for the kidney ailments suffered by 26 cadets.
   Shannon said he would not prosecute but that the chief of the
agency responsible for the training should resign or be dismissed.
   Shepard was hospitalized in critical condition after collapsing
on a running track and underwent a liver transplant a week later.
   He gradually emerged from the coma and his condition was upgraded
to serious last week, but he still was unable to breathe on his own
or speak.
   Just two days before his relapse, Shepard wrote a note to his
pregnant wife, Holly: ``I made it.'' The couple married in June.
   Friends remembered the young man, who had dreamed of being a
police officer, as having a way with youngsters. ``He was just so
nice, I couldn't see him arresting people,'' said James Mooney,
executive director of the Pittsfield Boys' Club.
   His wife recalled how Shepard had run in a park near their home,
borrowed law books from friends in the Police Department and
practiced shooting so he could be ready for the training.
   ``He wanted to be tops at the academy,'' she said. ``He wanted to
graduate No. 1 in his class.''

   Late last week, volunteers for Democrat Anna
Eshoo finished door-to-door delivery of 110,000 copies of a video
she produced as part of her $800,000 campaign for a House seat from
California's Silicon Valley.
   At around the same time and nearly a continent away, 79-year-old
Rep. William H. Natcher found a parking spot without a meter for his
car in Franklin, Ky., clambered out and began the kind of
campaigning he knows best: visiting the community's shops and
talking to people on the street.
   Natcher, a Democrat and 35-year veteran of the House, as usual
expects to spend about $5,000 in this year's re-election bid, all of
it his own money. And he's expected to defeat Republican Martin
Tori, a 48-year-old businessman who plans to spend $100,000.
   That kind of a race is a rarity among House campaigns, and while
Eshoo's is the other extreme, it's closer to the norm in Congress
these days.
   The San Mateo County supervisor plans to pour $800,000 into her
campaign against Republican Thomas Campbell, a Stanford University
law professor who will invest $1.1 million in the race, making this
one of the most expensive of the 435 House contests. Campbell
defeated Rep. Ernest Konnyu in the Republican primary, the only
incumbent to lose such a contest this year.
   ``The amounts are outrageous, but our viability is tested out by
how much money you raise,'' says the 45-year-old Eshoo. ``This is
not the way it should be, but it's one of those unfortunate facts of
life.''
   Indeed, while the cost of living tripled between 1974 and 1986,
the average cost of a House campaign increased nearly five-fold,
from $53,384 to $260,032.
   Incumbents, who have a much easier time attracting contributions,
outspent their challengers by an average of $334,223 to $124,739 two
years ago, while each candidate for an open seat shelled out an
average of $436,847.
   Everyone expects the amount to increase once again this year, and
with it the money solicited from special interest groups and
individuals.
   Herbert Alexander, a political science professor at the
University of Southern California who specializes in campaign
financing, says the mushrooming costs are caused by ``the
professionalization of politics,'' a growing use of expensive
technologies like computers and direct mailings and of lawyers,
pollsters and other professionals.
   Alexander says the will to spend these amounts of money comes
from candidates who increasingly see politics as lifelong careers.
Well-stocked treasuries increasingly translate into re-election;
very little movement is expected in the 255-177
Democratic-Republican split in the House. Three seats are vacant.
   ``Their ambitions are to stay in the House for 20 years, or to
move up to the Senate or a governorship,'' he said. ``They want job
security.''
   In the Eshoo-Campbell 12th district race, the financial stakes
have skyrocketed despite both candidates' decisions not to use
television advertising, an expensive proposition in the San
Francisco Bay area.
   Eshoo's video cost her $134,000, and she's spending most of the
rest of her money on direct mail _ a widely used technique in
California _ telephones, computers and a staff of 23 paid workers.
Campbell is relying heavily on direct mail, radio advertising,
computers and telephones, and has a smaller paid staff of 15.
   ``This is a very expensive district to get a candidate
well-known,'' says Ronald Smith, a consultant to Campbell. ``He
started out with zero name recognition.''
   Other candidates have used videos before, but Eshoo's aides say
no campaign tapes have ever been as widely distributed. They say
with 80 percent of the district's residents owning VCR's, the
novelty of the idea is likely to entice many voters to watch the
cassette, which features the candidate talking and is called, ``Anna
Eshoo Challenges the Sacred Cows.''
   Campbell workers say their polls show that Eshoo has received
little help from the tapes. ``It was a cute gimmick, but for that
money she could have bought some nice television,'' sniffs Smith.
   The most expensive campaign in the country is being waged 200
miles to the south, where seven-term GOP Rep. Robert Lagomarsino,
62, is facing a spirited challenge from Democratic state Sen. Gary
K. Hart, 48, in the state's 19th district. Each candidate was
well-known when the race began, and each plans to spend about $1.2
million in a campaign that is relying heavily on television
advertising and direct mail.
   Other expensive House races, according to campaign finance
documents, are in:
   _The New York 20th district, where two-term GOP Rep. Joseph
DioGuardi plans to spend about $1 million against former New York
Assistant Secretary of State Nita Lowey, who has raised $747,000.
   _The Nebraska 2nd, an open seat where Republican Jerry Schenken,
a pathologist, has spent $821,000 and Democratic former state Sen.
Peter Hoagland has spent $600,000.
   _The Indiana 3rd, where GOP Rep. John Hiler has raised $689,000
and Democratic lawyer Tom Ward has garnered $403,000.
   No race this year is expected to eclipse the total $3 million
that Rep. Matthew Rinaldo, R-N.J., and Democratic challenger Adam
Levin spent in 1982. But Natcher says that from the lectures he
gives entering House freshmen every two years, there's little doubt
that campaign expenditures will keep rising.
   ``This last time, when I told them they should leave the money
alone, I could tell by the expressions on their faces that they
didn't agree with me,'' he said.

   Top Labor Party officials are considering
ousting Shimon Peres as party leader because of Labor's poor showing
in parliamentary elections, party sources and published reports said
today.
   Five Israeli newspapers and Israel radio said as many as five
ranking leaders in the left-leaning party have discussed a party
shake-up in private consultations.
   A party official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed
the reports and said Peres was under fire primarily for spearheading
a campaign which focused too closely on his own personality and the
need for an international peace conference.
   Shlomo Avineri, a political scientist and Labor activist, also
confirmed the criticism of Peres. If the party doesn't head Israel's
next government, ``there is going to be a groundswell in Labor to
get rid of Peres,'' Avineri said in a telephone interview.
   An aide to a Labor minister who demanded anonymity said: ``There
are voices in the party that believe the time has come for Peres to
go.''
   But Peres aide Yossi Beilin, who is also a newly elected
legislator, denied that Peres' leadership is threatened.
   ``Certainly there is disappointment after the elections and some
soul-searching,'' Beilin told Israel Television. ``I don't think
there is any challenge to Peres' leadership. We have no other
leader.''
   Peres has led the party through four elections, losing three
times and managing a tie in the 1984 parliament balloting. Some
party members believe he has acquired a loser's image as a result.
   Election results gave Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of the
right-wing Likud bloc, which outscored Labor 39 seats to 38, a clear
advantage in getting a majority of 61 seats in Israel's 120-seat
Knesset, or parliament.
   Likud and parties to the right won 46 seats, while Labor and
parties to the left won 48. The Orthodox religious parties won 18
seats, and have indicated a greater willingness to join a Likud
government than one formed by Labor.
   Fueling the anti-Peres atmosphere was a report in the independent
Hadashot daily that Shamir would consider forming a joint government
with Labor only if Peres and his deputy, Cabinet Minister Ezer
Weizman, are replaced.
   However, another Labor official said arranging a reshuffle and
overcoming Peres' expected resistance would take too long and not be
concluded before Likud built a coalition on its own.
   News reports have suggested Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin could
replace Peres. Rabin, who served as prime minister from 1974-77, is
more popular among right-wing Israelis because of his tough policies
in suppressing the 11-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied
territories.

   A Minneapolis man accused of taking part
in the execution of thousands of Latvians during World War II worked
for the U.S. Army in West Germany after the war, the government
disclosed in court documents.
   A lawsuit filed by the U.S. Justice Department alleges that
Edgars Inde, 79, belonged to a unit known as the Arajs Commando,
which executed 13,000 Latvians, most of them Jews, in 1941 after
Nazi Germany invaded Latvia.
   The suit seeks to revoke Inde's citizenship, the first step
toward deportation, for allegedly lying about his wartime activities
when he came to the United States after the war.
   After the suit was filed Aug. 22, Inde denied having killed Jews.
   Documents related to the suit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District
Court, said he was hired by the Army's Military Labor Service as a
civilian guard in 1947 and worked for the Army until 1949, the year
he came to the United States.
   He and his family moved to Minneapolis in 1952, and Inde became a
citizen in 1955.
   The commando unit to which Inde is accused of belonging was
formed in 1941 after Nazi Germany invaded Latvia, a onetime
independent country that had been absorbed by the Soviet Union in
1940.

   Lloyd Bentsen was hoping to round up
support for Michael Dukakis and himself during a bus tour of East
Texas, where Democrats abound but tend to be conservative.
   Bentsen knws the ticket is behind in the polls and struggling. To
deliver his home state and its 29 electoral votes, he needs to bring
in East Texas by a wide enough margin to offset Republican strength
to the West in Dallas and the Texas panhandle.
   ``East Texas is right at the core of any Democratic strategy you
have,'' said Joe O'Neill, Bentsen's chief of staff. Bentsen and
Dukakis have both already visited the area, and the Democrats
contend they've been making progress.
   The trip today includes stops in Longview, Mt. Pleasant, Paris
and Sulphur Springs. To help get out the crowds, the senator planned
to have at his side movie actor Rob Lowe and country music singer
Gary Morris, an East Texas native.
   ``We're doing the maximum saturation of East Texas we can do in a
day,'' he said.
   Traditionally Democratic, the area is full of voters known as
``yellow dogs'' because of the saying that they'd vote for a dog if
it were a Democrat.
   But the area is also conservative, especially among the younger
white voters and recently pundits have been referrng to that group
as the ``bubba'' vote.
   The rural 1st Congressional District, which makes up the heart of
the area, gave Ronald Reagan 61 percent of the vote in 1984.
Democrats are confident Dukakis will do better, but the campaign has
been hurt there by Republican advertising that paints the
Massachusetts governor as soft on crime and defense, and in favor of
taking people's guns away.
   Bentsen has been fighting those claims every day, calling them
distortions and lies.
   ``I wouldn't be on the ticket with a fella who'd take my shotgun
away,'' he said, reminding crowds that he's a quail hunter _ a pun
aimed at George Bush's running mate, Dan Quayle.
   Bentsen has been stepping up his attacks on Quayle again lately.
Campaigning in Illinois, Ohio and West Virginia on Wednesday, Bush
blasted at Quayle at every stop.
   ``I'd like to have George Bush here and ask him ... `Did you pick
the very best person?''' he said at a rally in a steel plant at
Massillon, Ohio.
   Democratic polls indicate the Indiana senator remains an issue
that could turn a close election in their favor, said Tad Devine, a
senior adviser to Dukakis who has been coordinating the Bentsen half
of the ticket from the Boston headquarters.
   Devine was traveling with Bentsen this week to aid in the
campaign's efforts to get maximum television exposure for Bentsen.
The Dukakis campaign considers him a major asset and took the
unprecedented step last weekend of buying five minutes of network
television time for a statement by their vice presidential pick.

   Federal prosecutors today threatened to seek
contempt of court charges against Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos for
failing to provide fingerprints, palm prints and handwriting and
voice samples.
   A hearing was scheduled today before U.S. District Judge John
Walker, who could order the former Philippine president and first
lady jailed.
   Walker previously had ordered the couple to comply with the
requests contained in subpoenas issued earlier this year by the
grand jury that indicted them on charges of looting the Philippine
treasury of more than $100 million.
   A federal appeals court late last month upheld Walker's decision
that the Marcoses no longer have head-of-state immunity and must
honor the subpoenas.
   On Wednesday, tobacco heiress Doris Duke said she put up Mrs.
Marcos' $5 million bail on the racketeering charges because she is
``disgusted, embarrassed and ashamed'' with the way the U.S.
government has treated the Marcoses.
   Virtually all of the couple's assets are frozen or otherwise tied
up in litigation.
   ``I have always believed that an accused person is innocent until
proved guilty. I wish the rest of America agreed with me,'' Miss
Duke, 75, said in written response to questions submitted by the
Daily News.
   Miss Duke, once called ``the richest girl in the world,'' said
she would gladly testify as a character witness for the Marcoses,
whom she said she considers her ``dear friends.''
   ``I am disgusted, embarrassed and ashamed of my country's
mistreatment of Imelda and her ailing husband, Ferdinand,'' Miss
Duke wrote. ``Why should America spend millions and millions of
dollars prosecuting two people who for a generation have been our
closest allies, including our Pacific outpost against communism?''
   A lawyer for Miss Duke, Donald Robinson, said Wednesday the
wealthy recluse posted the bond ``because she knows that Mrs. Marcos
didn't commit any crimes.''
   Miss Duke, who has a 2,700-acre estate in New Jersey, pledged
more than $5 million in municipal bonds on behalf of Mrs. Marcos. A
lawyer for Mrs. Marcos said she planned to visit with Miss Duke
through the weekend even though she would be free to return to
Hawaii as soon as the bail paperwork was completed.
   U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan loosened travel restrictions
for Mrs. Marcos _ previously confined to the New York area _
allowing her to travel between New York City and Newport, R.I.,
where Miss Duke has a mansion.
   Once the bail documents are signed, Mrs. Marcos will be allowed
to travel anywhere in the United States. Her husband, however,
cannot leave the island of Oahu without permission of the Justice
Department, under a prior restriction.
   Lawyers said Miss Duke's bonds would be worth between $5.3
million and $5.4 million depending on market fluctuations. The exact
types of bonds were not revealed.
   ``It was Miss Duke's idea to help,'' Robinson said after
Wednesday's hearing conducted by Keenan.
   Mrs. Marcos, 59, who has been staying in an $1,800-a-day suite at
the Waldorf Towers, did not attend the hearing.
   ``Like President Reagan, Miss Duke regrets the indictment,'' the
lawyer said, referring to the president's comment after the
Marcoses' racketeering indictment was announced last month.
   ``Mrs. Marcos is extremely grateful and was tearful when she
learned of the offer,'' Robinson added.
   Mrs. Marcos flew to New York from the couple's home-in-exile in
Hawaii aboard Miss Duke's lavishly appointed private jet.
   Prosecutors said the bail documents would have to be signed by
Miss Duke, Mrs. Marcos and a clerk of the court as well as Keenan.
   Mrs. Marcos attorney John J. Tigue said his client ``plans to
visit with Miss Duke this weekend in New Jersey and perhaps in
Newport. She then will return to her ailing husband.''
   Marcos, 71, remained in Hawaii, where the couple have lived since
their ouster in a popular uprising in 1986. Defense attorneys argued
last week that he was too frail to make the 10-hour flight. Keenan
postponed Marcos' arraignment pending an examination by a government
physician.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles LaBella said the examination was
completed Monday but the physician's report is not ready.
   In a statement issued Wednesday through an aide, Marcos blasted
the way the press has covered the case. The media, he said, have
``declared President Ferdinand Marcos guilty of several charges
filed against him. Whatever happened to the time-honored legal maxim
that anyone is presumed innocent unless proven otherwise?''
   The Marcoses are charged with racketeering, accused of plundering
$103 million from the Philippine treasury, funneling it to foreign
bank accounts and using it to buy prime New York City real estate
and art.
   Their eight co-defendants _ including Saudi Arabian financier
Adnan Khashoggi _ remained at large outside the country, said
LaBella.

<HEAD>Doctors Say Intestinal Worm Illness Confused with Appendicitis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Raw or undercooked fish such as sushi can cause a
serious intestinal illness often mistaken for appendicitis, doctors
warned today.
   The disease, anisakiasis, is caused by eating fish infested with
larvae of worms known as anisakid nematodes. Cooking kills the worms.
   The doctors said about 50 cases of aniskaiasis have been reported
in the United States, but ``this may be the tip of the iceberg.''
   Drs. James H. McKerrow and Judy Sakanari of the University of
California, San Francisco, and Thomas L. Deardorff of the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration described the infection in a letter in
today's New England Journal of Medicine.
   The doctors said the emergence of the disease was partly due to
the popularity of sushi and sashimi and lightly cooked fish. Salmon
and pacific snapper are most commonly implicated in the disease.
   Another factor, they said, is the increasing number of seals, sea
lions, and other marine mammals that harbor the parasites in their
stomachs. The animals expel worm eggs in their feces, which are then
eaten by other sea creatures, including fish.
   People who eat wormy fish sometimes cough up live worms or feel
the worm in their throats, a condition known as ``tingling throat
syndrome.''
   In more serious cases, the worms burrow into the wall of the
stomach or the intestines. They are removed by a tube that is pushed
into the digestive system.

   A ballot measure that would force doctors
and blood banks to report the names of people who test positive for
the AIDS virus could set AIDS research back five years, the nation's
top health official says.
   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop said Proposition 102 ``would
drive people who could participate in drug trials away from research
and underground.''
   ``Everything we have done may step backwards five years,'' he
said in Wednesday's San Francisco Examiner.
   The proposition will be on the ballot Tuesday along with a
measure that would allow judges to order AIDS tests for persons
accused of sex crimes.
   The newspaper also reported the results of a poll of 600
registered voters that found that 41 percent of Californians favor
Proposition 102, 28 percent oppose it and 31 percent are undecided.
The margin of error was 4 points.
   ``There's no one in public health who supports this measure,''
said Koop, who has spoken out against the proposition in the past.
   ``It is contrary to every principle of public health I know.''

   A six-month extension of a state of
economic emergency began Thursday after Parliament voted to continue
the measure.
   Under the regulations announced in November 1987, anyone
convicted of economic crimes such as smuggling, fraud or
mismanagement of public funds faces stiff penalties.
   Eighty of the 114 members of the legislature voted in favor of
the extension Wednesday and 34 abstained.
   Last month, Vice President Abu Bakar Kamara put out an
international appeal for emergency food aid following floods he said
had put the West African nation in a ``desperate situation.'
   Kamara also has said the country expects a shortfall of 207,000
metric tons this year in its rice harvest. Rice is Sierra Leone's
staple food.
   In May, 32 civil servants and banking officials were arrested and
charged with engaging in irregularities that caused the state to
lose money. Some have been convicted.

<TEXT>
   The White House today defended President
Reagan's veto of a wilderness bill against Democratic charges that
the action was politically motiviated.
   ``In all these kinds of environmental questions, tradeoffs have
to be considered, and this was a case where the administration felt
that for a variety of economic and environmental reasons, it was
best not to designate this area as wilderness,'' presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   ``The Department of Agriculture had recommended a veto from the
beginning, so there wasn'tf where we stood on it,''
the spokesman said.
   The bill would have designated 1.43 million acres of Forest
Service land in much question o Montan as protected wilderness. The Forest
Service
is an agency of the Agriculture Department.
   ``This bill was vetoed for petty politics, and that's all,'' Sen.
Max Baucus, D-Mont., said Wednesday night, shortly after the White
House announced Reagan's pocket vetoes of the wilderness bill and a
second measure establishing a corporation to provide development
capital to Indian businesses.
   ``This is an affront to the people of Montana,'' Baucus said in a
statemes is likely to find it difficult to fulfill campaign
pledges.
   Despite a relative success in agriculture, Venezuela's economy
has been hard-hit by persistently low prices of oil, the nation's
major source of export revenue. Oil has plunged from a high of $30 a
barrel in the 1970s to its current level of around $13.
   Current prices on world markets continue to slump, a sharp
contrast to the market boom during Perez' first term, when he
nationalized the oil industry. The slide in oil prices this year
alone may cost the nation as much as $3 billion in revenue, nearly a
third of the $10.7 billion originally expected.
   Coupled with a foreign debt of $35 billion, Latin America's
fourth largest after Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, a continuation of
this trend may pose a heavy political and social burden to the
government to be installed in February.
   According to official statistics, real income for the average
Venezuelan family has shrunk by 20 percent since 1982, when oil
prices began to fall.
   While less than 1.5 percent of the population enjoys 35 percent
of the nation's income, 40 percent do not earn enough to cover their
basic nutritional needs, according to a Venezuelan Central
University report.
   Perez and Fernandez agree that drastic changes must be
implemented to reverse this trend. But while Perez proposes to
expand public sector expenditures as a means to boost the economy,
Fernandez says he would rely more on the private sector.
   Rather than emphasizing their differences, both Perez and
Fenandez have devoted most of their efforts trying to discredit each
other.
   Intense hostility kicked off the early part of the campaign when
both candidates accused each other of receiving campaign money from
drug traffickers.
   The exchange of accusations ceased only when the Supreme
Electoral Council, which supervises the campaign, called on Perez
and Fernandez to avoid injurious attacks.
   AD and COPEI have traditionally alternated in power, with AD
winning over COPEI four out of six times in the 30 years of civilian
rule.
   Both parties together totalled 90 percent of the vote in the 1983
elections, won by the AD's Jaime Lusinchi, now the incumbent
president.
   Twenty-one other candidates also are in the running, covering a
wide range of the political and social spectrum.
   One is a witch doctor, Romulo Abreu Duarte, who professes a
fervent belief in the legendary goddess Maria Lionza, descended, her
devotees say, from a Spanish conquistador and an Indian princess.
   Others include the former pro-Castro guerrilla leader Teodoro
Petkoff of the leftist Movement toward Socialism, and Ismenia
Villalba of the centrist Democratic Revolutionary Union.
   Aware of the overwhelming strength of AD and Copei, the minor
parties are aiming instead to win some of the 229 congressional
seats at stake.
   Both Villalba, the first woman to ever run for president in
Venezuela, and Petkoff expect to improve their parties'
congressional strength, now respectively 11 and 9 seats.
   The tiny Venezuelan Communist Party is running in a coalition led
by Edmundo Chirinos, former rector of Venezuelan Central University.
   AD and COPEI stand to lose considerable legislative power if the
minor parties make gains in the congressional balloting, analysts
say.

   The government will ease a travel ban to

   Starting Nov. 9, Chinese from the mainland can apply to visit
their parents, spouses or children who are gravely ill or seriously

   Visitors wanting to attend funerals of close relatives also will

   The Chinese Nationalist government and about 2 million supporters
fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to Communist forces
on the mainland.
   Nationalist authorities have banned all official contact with the

let Taiwan residents visit relatives in China.

<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang told
foreign businessmen that China's economic reforms erred in giving
too much power to local governments rather than to local
enterprises, sources said Thursday.
   Zhao also said in a meeting Wednesday with 80 participants in an
international business forum that there will be a slowdown in new
contracts with foreign companies as China imposes austerity measures
to cool off its overheated economy.
   The sources, who attended the meeting, said Zhao emphasized the
tightening of economic controls, to last at least two years, will
have no effect on China's long-term commitment to reform.
   Zhao, China's foremost advocate of rapid reform, said the process
of decentralizing controls over the economy had gone off-course in
giving power to local governments rather than local enterprises.
   ``He was very tough on local governments,'' the sources, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said. ``He said China wanted to correct
the situation.''
   A key to China's retrenchment program is Beijing's attempt to
regain controls over loans, project approvals and foreign trade that
it has ceded to local authorities in the past decade as it switched
from central planning to a market-determined economy.
   Provincial and municipal governments have ignored Beijing's
orders to cut spending and lending, and that has led to an excess of
new construction projects, severe raw material shortages,
unsustainable industrial growth and an inflation rate of more than
20 percent.
   Zhao also emphasized the contracts of foreign businessmen in
China won't be affected by government orders to cancel hundreds of
construction projects and stop exports of some materials.
   Zhao said China badly needs foreign investment, but will limit it
to priority areas of energy, transportation, agriculture and other
infrastructure development.
   The sources, however, said that in the three-day annual meeting
of the Swiss-based World Economic Forum, Chinese officials
acknowledged that some contracts will be canceled. They said all
exports of non-ferrous metals will be halted, and indicated that
grain exports will also be affected.
   Foreign businessmen at the forum said the Chinese have already
refused to respect some export contracts for non-ferrous metals.
   The sources quoted Zhao as saying that political and economic
fluctuations are normal in all countries and that foreigners should
``stop thinking we are different from other countries.''
   He gave as an example of political changes the U.S. presidential
election to take place next week and the just-concluded elections in
Israel.
   China's decision to put the brakes on some economic reforms led
to speculation that Zhao might have been overshadowed by the more
cautious Premier Li Peng as the nation's top decision-maker on
economic matters.
   There has been no indication, however, that Zhao is in political
trouble as a result of the economic problems.
   Zhao said the Communist Party's role as the ruling political
group will not change, but there will be a change in style under
political reforms aimed at separating party and government functions.

   The United States is reviewing a request from
the government of Maldives for help to repulse a coup attempt, U.S.
officials said today.
   A request for help was received by the U.S. Embassy in Sri Lanka,
which represents the United States in the tropical island chain some
400 miles away, said the officials, who declined to be named.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``The exact
status of the situation on the ground is a little uncertain. We have
not provided any direct assistance of any kind at this point. The
Maldives are friendly to the United States and we generally support
them, but in terms of this existing situation, it appears to be
resolving itself.''
   In response to a question, Fitzwater said there had been no
indirect U.S. assistance, either.
   The United States is also consulting with India, which has
received a similar request for help, the officials said.
   ``We are reviewing the situation and discussing options with the
Maldives' friends, mainly India,'' said one official.
   He said the United States does not have a presence on the Indian
Ocean islands and is therefore short of information about the armed
attack on government offices in the capital of Male.
   Fighting appears to be continuing around the national police
headquarters, but the presidential palace appears to be in
government hands, with the president inside, the official said.
   He said the situation is ``confusing and fluid'' and the United
States had not decided what kind of help, if any, it would offer.

<HEAD>Newspaper Owner Puts `Vote For Bush' In Place of `Cathy'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CULLMAN, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper owner dropped the comic strip
``Cathy'' for criticizing George Bush and replaced it today with a
pro-Bush ad.
   Bob Bryan, publisher and owner of The Cullman Times and the
Athens News Courier, said Wednesday that he would pay for the
advertisement on the comics page.
   Bryan said he ``just took the panel out that would have been
`Cathy' and right where `Cathy' has been, put in big type `Vote For
Bush.''' After today, he said, he will replace ``Cathy'' with
another strip.
   The popular comic strip about a single working woman has been
running politically flavored episodes for more than a week. In them,
a friend of Cathy's is depicted as strongly criticizing the
Reagan-Bush administration.
   Several newspapers pulled installments of the strip, and at least
one other newspaper said last week that it was canceling ``Cathy''
altogether.
   Bryan said he believes the comic strip is no place for a
political message.
   ``I wouldn't have wanted the cartoonist or syndicate to endorse
Bush in the paper,'' he said.
   ``Cathy''' creator Cathy Guisewite said last week that ``it was
in keeping with the strip to comment on women's issues that are at
stake in this election.''
   Alan McDermott, managing editor for Universal Press Syndicate,
said Bryan had called to cancel ``Cathy.''
   He said 30 to 40 other representatives of newspapers have
contacted the Kansas City-based syndicate in the last two weeks to
express concern about the comic strip's political turn.

   Czechoslovak customs officials
found the body of a woman apparently strangled on an international
train traveling from Romania to East Germany, it was reported
Thursday.
   The body of the woman, whose identity and nationality were being
investigated by police, was found Tuesday on the Balt-Orient Express
in the city of Decin, 75 miles north of Prague, according to the
Slobodne Slovo newspaper.
   Despite the questionign of the passengers, the police still were
looking for the killer whose ``reasons were probably of sexual
nature,'' it reported.
   Another daily, Zemedelske Noviny, said the woman was between 18
and 25 years old.
   The Balt-Orient Express runs from Romania to East Germany, and is

<TEXT>
   Voters next week will settle a four-year
dispute over whether the city should open its golden gate to the
historic battleship USS Missouri, on which Gen. Douglas MacArthur
accepted Japan's surrender in World War II.
   Supporters, led by former mayor Dianne Feinstein, believe that
serving as the home port for the 58,000-ton ship will bring San
Francisco at least 5,000 new jobs, increase city revenues and
revitalize the waterfront.
   Opponents, led by Mayor Art Agnos, argue that it could cost the
deficit-plagued city millions while generating unwanted and possibly
hazardous environmental consequences.
   Environmentalists fear that extensive port dredging to
accommodate the ship could stir up deadly toxic wastes. Anti-nuclear
activists charge the Missouri's weaponry would increase the
likelihood of a nuclear accident, and gay rights advocates oppose
the Navy's hiring practices.
   Agnos placed Measure R on the ballot requiring the federal
government to foot the bill for keeping the Missouri at the old
shipyard at Hunters Point. It also would require that 351 promised
new jobs go to San Franciscans under union contracts.
   But Feinstein, who originally proposed the city as the Missouri's
home port in early 1985, disagrees. ``It's a good deal to the city _
for an upfront investment of $2 million, the city brings in $200
million a year in ship repair, payroll and services,'' she said.
   Supporters of Feinstein's plan have placed a rival Measure S on
the ballot instructing the city to implement Feinstein's non-binding
1987 agreement with the Navy to improve port facilities and
requiring the city to process and approve all actions necessary to
carry out the agreement, including the allocation of $2 million to
pay for dredging.
   She and her allies fear that if approved, Measure R would send
the Navy elsewhere.
   Indeed, Navy Secretary William L. Ball III has rejected Agnos'
terms, saying there is ``no way in which the Navy could proceed with
the Missouri homeporting were such a plan adopted by the city.''
   But Agnos has said the city is ``serious about wanting the Navy
... in a way that works for San Francisco. The current plan works
only for the Navy.''
   He called Feinstein's agreement a ``one-sided, sweetheart deal .
.. that doesn't guarantee one job for San Francisco and doesn't
guarantee one dollar for San Francisco.''
   Feinstein counters that Agnos is philosophically opposed to
basing the Missouri in San Francisco, despite public opinion polls
showing a majority of residents favoring the plan.
   A public vote is ``the only way'' to get the plan back on course,
said Feinstein, adding, ``When I left office, I thought it was all
set.''
   ``Most of us who are native San Franciscans want to do our share,
we want to do our part to provide a strong defense,'' she said.
   ``This is not a patriotic issue,'' insisted Agnos. ``It's not a
good business deal for the local taxpayer who is being asked to foot
the bill.''

<TEXT>
   Both George Bush and Michael Dukakis have
promised vigorous attempts to revive stalled Arab-Israeli peace
talks, but the next president will face either a hardline Israeli
government or a stalemated one.
   The Israeli elections Tuesday appear to have handed a narrow
victory to the right-wing Likud bloc, which got one seat more in
Parliament than the Labor Party of Foreign Minister Shimon Peres.
   Likud is trying to form a coalition government with a bloc of
religious and ultra-nationalist parties. If that doesn't work, Likud
may invite Labor to join the government as a junior partner,
replicating the current government which has been paralyzed by
internal conflict.
   Either way, the elections, which were viewed as referendum on the
future of the Israeli-occupied territories, failed to give the
liberal Labor Party a clear-cut mandate to negotiate peace with the
Arabs. Peres, backed by the United States and moderate Arab
governments, campaigned on a platform of relinquishing some lands in
return for peace.
   ``The Israelis have obviously circled their wagons,'' said Fouad
Adjami, a scholar at the School of Advanced International Studies of
Johns Hopkins University. The 11-month Palestinian uprising in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip pushed voters to the right,
precluding an opening for peace, he said.
   Likud spokesman Binyamin Netanyahu, formerly Israeli ambassador
to the U.N., rejects such bleak predictions. Speaking from Israel on
NBC, Netanyahu appealed to the next American president to support
direct talks between Israel and the Arabs on autonomy for the 1.3
million Palestinians in the occupied territories.
   Likud leader Prime Minister Yitzgak Shamir ``is sensitive to U.S.
desires and he will try to offer some ideas for peace talks,'' said
Middle East analyst Joyce Starr.
   ``But this won't succeed in the long run because he's not willing
to consider giving up lands for peace,'' she added. Starr is a
researcher at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, an
independent think tank.
   Both the Bush and Dukakis proposals on Arab-Israeli peace have
been vague. Dukakis has talked about sending a special emissary to
push the sides to the negotiating table. Bush has never been
specific but his aides have indicated he would continue Reagan
administration policy.
   That policy, formulated by Secretary of State George Shultz,
called for Arab-Israeli talks under the auspices of the superpowers.
   But despite four shuttles by U.S. officials to the region this
year, the Shultz plan encountered tough opposition from the Likud,
the Palestine Liberation Organization and several Arab governments.
It now appears dead.
   Bush is likely to support any Israeli initiative for the sake of
preventing an irreversible freeze of the peace process, analysts say.
   ``If Likud comes forward with sincere proposals, Bush will want
to work with them. He doesn't want confrontation,'' said Martin
Indyk, director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a
Washington think tank.
   Whichever candidate comes to power in Washington, clashes with a
Shamir administration are virtually certain in view of a Likud
promise to quash the Palestinian uprising once and for all.
   That ``means more brutality, more Palestinians killed, more _
probably _ expulsions, perhaps even the idea of some attempt at a
mass transfer of Palestinians out of the West Bank and Gaza,'' said
Edward Said, a professor of English at Columbia Univerity and a
member of the Palestine National Council, which is the PLO's
parliamentary arm.
   The Reagan administration has repeatedly chastised Israel for its
harsh tactics against the Palestinians. Massive expulsions or a
higher Palestinian death toll are unlikely to be tolerated in
Washington, said Indyk.
   ``On the other hand, if the measures aren't horrendous and they
come within a framework of a Likud peace proposal, the U.S. may be
more tolerant,'' he added.
   A right-wing government will also seek to augment Jewish
settlements in the occupied territories. The settlements have been
anathema to past U.S. administrations.
   The next U.S. president will also face a dilemma with the PLO.
Its parliamentary arm is scheduled to meet in Algeria later this
month amid predictions that it will announce recognition of Israel
and call for an independent Palestinian state side-by-side with the
Jewish one.
   ``If that happens, the Americans will have to talk to the PLO
because they will have met our conditions for dialogue, and that,
too, is a potential clash with Israel,'' said Ms. Starr.
   Likud rejects any dialogue with the PLO, which Palestinians view
as their only representative but which Israel views as a terrorist
organization.

   A man has been convicted of trying to smuggle
7,300 pounds of cocaine into the United States inside hollowed-out
picnic-table lumber.
   After eight hours deliberation, a federal jury Wednesday found
61-year-old Michael J. Tsalickis of Tarpon Springs guilty in what
federal officials said was the second-largest cocaine seizure on
record.
   He faces a maximum term of life in prison at sentencing Jan. 17.
   ``I am innocent. I'm going to ask for a retrial,'' Tsalickis said.
   Federal prosecutors maintained Tsalickis and two Colombian
companions were operating on behalf of the Cali Cartel, a Colombian
drug organization.
   Tsalickis was found guilty of conspiring with the two Colombians
to smuggle the cocaine into St. Petersburg by hiding it inside cedar
boards on a freighter that arrived from Brazil on April 19. The
Colombians await trial next week.
   The shipping paperwork identified the wood as lumber for picnic
tables and other outdoor furniture.
   Tsalickis maintained he was acting as the purchasing and shipping
agent for one of the Colombians, who told him he wanted the lumber
to start a furniture business.

<TEXT>
   Soviet criminal law will be revised by the end of
the year and then ``there will be no basis to speak about political
prisoners,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said
Thursday.
   He would not state clearly, however, if all laws used to
prosecute people for their political beliefs would be repealed.
   Nor would he say whether all current political prisoners will be
freed. West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said last week Soviet
officials told him in his meetings in Moscow that all political
prisoners would be freed by the end of the year.
   ``There was nothing new in discussions with the West German
chancellor on that issue in Moscow,'' Gerasimov said.
   When asked directly if that meant the prisoners would not be
freed by the end of the year, he simply repeated that Kohl was told
nothing new.
   ``The attempts to interpret our explanations as a `concession' to
Western pressure are groundless,'' he continued.
   Members of the Western alliance reportedly have demanded that all
Soviet political prisoners be released as a condition for concluding
the current security talks in Vienna, and for an international
humanitarian conference in Moscow.
   Gerasimov denied Western reports of 200 to 250 political
prisoners in the Soviet Union and said that as of Thursday, only 11
people still were being held under the four laws involved in Western
complaints. There are another 25 ``insane people not condemned
because they were sent for compulsory medical treatment.''
   Gerasimov said that as of Thursday, two people are in prison and
five are in internal exile under Article 70, which bans anti-Soviet
agitation and two people are in prison under Article 190, which bans
anti-Soviet slander.
   He said two people are incarcerated under Article 227, which bans
criminal offenses under the pretext of practicing religion, and no
one is imprisoned under Article 142, which requires the separation
of church and state.
   Justice Minister Boris Kravtsov said Monday that Article 190 is
to be repealed and Article 70 will be narrowed under the pending
revision of the criminal code.

   American actress Koo Stark, a former girlfriend of
Prince Andrew, won $534,000 in libel damages today from a newspaper
that falsely implied she had an adulterous affair with the prince
after her marriage.
   A High Court jury unanimously found that two articles printed in
the tabloid Sunday People newspaper on successive weekends in
December 1985 had defamed the 32-year-old actress.
   The jury also awarded Ms. Stark undisclosed costs against the
newspaper's publisher, Robert Maxwell.
   Ms. Stark said during the three-day trial that the newspaper was
wrong to allege she had kept secret dates with the prince or that
she felt a ``lingering love'' for him after her marriage in August
1984 to Timothy Jeffries.
   She testified she met the prince, Queen Elizabeth II's second
son, only once after her wedding and on that occasion was
accompanied by her husband, heir to the Green Shield trading stamp
business, reportedly worth $85 million.
   Ms. Stark said the allegations implied she was deceiving her
husband and having an adulterous affair.
   Her lawyer, Desmond Browne, told Judge Michael Davies that
articles had been published at a time when Ms. Stark was
experiencing difficulties in her marriage.
   He said Ms. Stark had been feeling ``wretched'' about her
marriage and was hoping for a reconciliation. But the ``cruelly
damaging and wholly untrue'' newspaper stories dashed all hope of
that, he said.
   The couple has since separated but are not divorced.
   Her lawyer said the newspaper had used a headline ``Secret Dates
AFTER She Wed.'' He said that by putting the word ``after'' in
capital letters, the newspaper had deliberately given emphasis to
the author's insinuation that she was deceiving her husband.
   ``The Sunday People in publishing all this smoke was playing with
fire and it was Miss Stark who got burned,'' Browne told the court.
   The Sunday People did not defend the truth of their articles but
denied they were defamatory.
   The judge ordered that all except for $88,000 of Ms. Stark's
damages be retained by the court pending an appeal by the newspaper.
   Ms. Stark, who once starred in a soft-porn movie, created world
headlines in Octover 1982 when she and Prince Andrew slipped out of
Britain under false names to vacation together on the Caribbean
island of Mustique.
   She won ``substantial'' undisclosed libel damages in March when
another newspaper falsely claimed her supposed reaction in 1986 to
the prince's new girlfriend, Sarah Ferguson, whom he later married.

   The Commerce Department, demonstrating its new
computer system for export licensing, said Thursday it wants to help
Japan, West Germany and other allies develop similar technology for
keeping strategic goods from flowing to communist nations.
   Commerce Undersecretary Paul Freedenberg said ``The Japanese have
lagged on this but now they're interested,'' and that almost all
other major allies had inquired as well about the advanced licensing
system.
   Freedenberg demonstrated a new optical character reader which
scans typed applications for export licenses and automatically
stores them in a computer. Licensing officials can then call up the
information on their desk terminals, and grant or deny the licenses.
   Their decisions also go into the computer, so that U.S. Customs
officials can easily find out if a particular shipment has been
licensed and can be shipped, whether or not they have the actual
paperwork in hand.
   Freedenberg said $90 to $100 billion worth of U.S. exports each
year are strategic goods subject to licensing, out of total exports
of $220 billion.
   A Commerce Department statement said the new system will be able
to process 1,200 licenses a day instead of the current 400.
   Michael E. Zacharia, assistant secretary for export
administration, has been on a trip to explain U.S. willingness to
help computerize other countries' systems. ``Their business people
complain of red tape and long delays, just like ours do,'' he said.
   ``If we can help them speed things up they're more likely to back
us in our number one job: preventing really strategic goods from
being diverted,'' Zacharia said.
   According to the department, it took 60 days on average to
process a U.S. license application in 1984, and 17 days last year.
The department is trying to bring the average down to 14 days for
1988.

<TEXT>
   A strong earthquake today off
the coast of El Salvador terrified residents of the capital and
shook much of Central America, but no damage or casualties were
reported.
   Thousands of people ran into the streets of San Salvador, where
an earthquake two years ago killed 1,500 people and injured 20,000.
   In Guatemala, the National Emergency Committee was put on alert
and was checking for damage or injuries, especially in western
Escuintla Province, nearest the epicenter.
   Readings on the 8:47 a.m. quake varied. The U.S. Geological
Survey in Golden, Colo., said it measured 6 on the Richter scale.
The monitoring center at the University of Costa Rica said it
measured 6.5 on the Richter scale.
   The center in Costa Rica said the ground shook for at least 30
seconds in San Salvador.
   The Geological Survey said the quake was centered in the Pacific
Ocean about 60 miles off El Salvador.
   The 1986 quake was centered in the capital, which is 25 miles
from the coast. It struck on Oct. 10, measured 7.5 on the Richter
scale and left tens of thousands homeless.
   The Institute of Seismology at the University of Costa Rica
reported a second temblor registering 4.8 on the Richter scale shook
San Salvador at 9:19 a.m. The institute said the second quake also
shook Santa Ana, San Salvador's second largest city, 25 miles
northeast of San Salvador.
   The Richter scale is an open-ended gauge of energy released by an
earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph.
   A quake with a magnitude of 4 can cause moderate damage in a
populated area, a quake of magnitude 5 considerable damage, a
magnitude 6 quake severe damage, one of magnitude 7 widespread,
heavy damage and a magnitude 8 quake is a ``great'' earthquake
capable of tremendous damage.
   The Costa Rican seismological center said the quake was along a
fault line that runs from Mexico to the border between Costa Rica
and Panama on the Pacific Ocean.

   France will its triple its budget for AIDS research
and quadruple spending on education aimed at preventing spread of
the disease, the government said Thursday.
   Health Minister Claude Evin announced the program after a Cabinet
meeting, and said the government intends to ``mobilize every French
man and woman'' in the fight.
   ``AIDS should no longer be considered a disease that only
concerns what are called `marginal' populations,'' Evin was quoted
as saying in the daily Le Monde. ``In three years, AIDS will cause
more deaths in France than traffic accidents.''
   The Health Ministry said it expects 4,000 deaths from acquired
immune deficiency syndrome next year in France and about 8,000 in
1990. Last year there were 9,855 traffic deaths here.
   Evin said France will devote about $25 million to AIDS research,
three times the amount budgeted this year.
   For education on AIDS, spending will increase to about $16
million next year, up from about $4 million.
   An extra $70 million will be provided to hospitals to cover the
cost of treating AIDS victims, he said.
   The government also plans to establish a National AIDS Council of
about 15 members to recommend further action and an agency to
coordinate actions by different government departments against AIDS.

<TEXT>
   The man whose conviction for the 1963
``Career Girl Murders'' led to the abandonment of New York state's
death penalty has been denied parole a third time, officials said
Thursday.
   Edward Elwin, executive director of the Division of Parole, said
a three-member panel unanimously denied Richard Robles' parole
application Wednesday and Robles was informed a few hours later.
   Robles can apply for parole again in November 1990.
   Robles, 45, began serving a life sentence in 1965 for the murders
of Janice Wylie, 21, and Emily Hoffert, 23, in their Manhattan
apartment.
   Robles said he was in the process of turning around his life
after years of of drug abuse and burglary and was committing ``one
last burglary'' to get ``necessities'' for his family when he
entered the women's apartment, which he said he thought was vacant.
But Miss Wylie was there, and he raped her at knifepoint, according
to police.
   He bound and robbed Miss Hoffert when she walked in, authorities
said. Robles said he killed the women after Miss Hoffert vowed to
remember him for police.
   George Whitmore Jr., then 19, admitted to the killings in a
confession that was later said to have been coerced by police.
Whitmore was exonerated when Robles was arrested in January 1965.
   The conduct of the police and the possibility that Whitmore could
have been executed was a significant factor in the Legislature's
1965 decision to do away with the death penalty for most killings.
Subsequent court decisions invalided the rest of New York's capital
punishment statute.

   About 150 foreign gunmen trying to
overthrow the Maldives government today battled loyalist troops, and
at least 12 people were reported killed. India rushed in soldiers to
help the government, sources said.
   Indian defense and home ministry sources said the paratroopers
took off from south India after nightfall. The sources spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The Press Trust of India news agency said earlier that India had
three warships ``ready to sail'' to the neighboring Maldives, where
President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom appealed to India and the United
States for help.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
officials were reviewing the request. ``The Maldives are friendly to
the United States and we generally support them, but in terms of
this existing situation, it appears to be resolving itself,'' he
said.
   The attackers arrived in the capital, Male, by boat before dawn
and attacked the presidential palace.
   Ahmed Abdullah Aziz, the Maldivian high commissioner in Sri
Lanka, said the Maldivian government had beaten back the attackers.
``The government is in full control of the situation,'' he said.
   However, residents of Male, a city of 55,000, said sporadic
gunfire continued through the day. By nightfall, foreign gunmen were
in control of part of Male, according to Western diplomats in
Colombo who spoke on condition of anonymnity.
   A Sri Lankan government official in Colombo said at least 12
people were killed and 22 injured in clashes after the attack. The
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he received the
information from the Sri Lankan High Commission in Male.
   Western diplomats in Colombo, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said loyalist troops were in control of the capital, but
they said attackers held the radio and television station.
   An Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman in New Delhi said reports
from the Indian High Commission in Male indicated the attackers were
Sri Lankan.
   The official said the attackers captured several senior Maldivian
officials, including two members of Gayoom's Cabinet. ``The
situation is still sketchy,'' he said.
   A tropical island chain that is home to 190,000 people, the
Maldives are 400 miles southwest of Sri Lanka and India. India is
the regional power and does not want to see the current balance
upset. It has thousands of troops in Sri Lanka to try to quell a war
by militant Tamils.
   Edward Moss, deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in
Colombo, said Maldivian officials contacted the United States,
Britain and other countries for help. He did not say if the
officials requested military intervention.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said
the Reagan administration has been in touch with India about the
coup attempt.
   Another U.S. official, who demanded anonymity, said: ``We are
reviewing the situation and discussing options with the Maldives'
friends, mainly India.''
   Aziz said the raiders spoke Tamil but that he did not know who
was behind the attack. Tamil is not spoken by Maldivians. It is the
language of ethnic minorities in Sri Lanka and India.
   A Sri Lankan military official said former President Ibrahim
Nasir was believed to be behind the attempt to overthrow Gayoom, who
defeated Nasir in the 1978 election and won a third five-year term
on Sept. 23.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Nasir
sent an agent to Sri Lanka to recruit Tamil militants to stage a
coup. He said Nasir moved to Singapore after 1978 and his followers
tried in 1980 to overthrow Gayoom.
   A Sri Lankan pharmacist in Male said she had rushed medicine to a
government hospital to treat people injured in the attack.
   Electricity was cut off in Male and no civilians were on the
streets, she said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The Maldives' airport was closed and all flights were turned
back, according to officials in Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
   ``Male is like a dead city,'' said Sri Lanka's high commissioner
in the Maldives, Mohammad Ali. He said the trouble began about 4:30
a.m. with a loud explosion, followed by exchanges of gunfire.
   Several residents of Male said they were staying off the streets
because of uncertainty.
   The first reports to reach the outside world said the gunmen had
captured the presidential palace and taken Gayoom prisoner, along
with National Security Minister Ilias Ibrahim and Presidential
Affairs Minister Abbas Ibrahim.
   Gayoom, 50, has charted a course of non-alignment for the remote
republic.

<HEAD>Cuban Documentary Says Theft A `Cancer' On Nation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Huge quantities of cash and merchandise are
stolen each year from state enterprises in Cuba because of lax
security procedures, according to a secret Cuban documentary that
was smuggled out of the island by a defector.
   The tape concludes with an observation by Cuban Defense Minister
Raul Castro that ``1 million police'' could not solve Cuba's crime
problem without additional accounting controls.
   The principal theme of a second government documentary is that
many of Cuba's young people are alienated, lack revolutionary fervor
and complain that facilities for recreational activities are too
often run down, non-existent, off-limits or inaccessible.
   A screening of the two documentaries, produced by the National
Revolutionary Police in 1986 and intended for government and party
officials, was held this week under the sponsorship of Freedom
House, a New York-based human rights group.
   The director of Freedom House's Washington office, Frank Calzon,
said he has no doubt that the tapes are ``legitimate videos made by
Cuban police. No one would have the capacity to make such films
except the Cuban police.''
   Calzon said the tapes were smuggled out of Cuba by Juan Antonio
Rodriguez Manier, a major in Cuban intelligence who defected to the
West in January 1987.
   Raul Castro, brother of President Fidel Castro, summed up his
feelings about the crime issue in brief remarks shown at the end of
the presentation.
   Flanked by fellow Communist Party members, Castro said the tape
was ``more illustrative than 100 speeches'' about the problem
because it aired the comments of the convicted criminals themselves.
The present system, he said, ``invites delinquency.''
   President Castro has publicly acknowledged that crime is a major
problem. The documentary shows Castro saying in a 1986 speech that a
``fierce struggle'' is needed to wipe out crime.
   ``Socialism can't permit this cancer to corrode it, that this
cancer devour it,'' he said.
   The documentary on crime showed repeated instances of how
employees at state enterprises were able to take advantage of lax
accounting procedures to steal cash or goods.
   Most of the testimony was provided by convicted criminals but
there was no indication of how they were caught. One convict spoke
of how he was able to make off with 224 cases of coffee worth 67,200
pesos. Under Cuba's exchange rate, the peso is worth slightly more
than a dollar.
   Another witness said he was able to pocket about 100 pesos a day
in daily receipts from the enterprise where he worked. He kept up
the activity for three years.
   Yet another said he was able to steal fabric for women's clothes
and leather for shoes in a gambit that appeared to require little
planning or imagination. A security guard was posted at the
warehouse where the goods were kept but he was deaf, the convict
said.
   Several Cubans responsible for taking daily cash proceeds from
their respective enterprises to banks for deposit said they
routinely undertook the trips alone, either on foot or by bus,
without protection.
   In the second documentary, Cuban youths complained to
interviewers that the best beaches often are reserved for tourists
or that transportation to the seashore was impossible because of a
shortage of buses. Cuba's television fare was described as
``garbage'' and there were scenes of a Havana amusement park which
was in a state of almost total disrepair.
   ``Who is the president of Cuba?'' one young man was asked.
   A perplexed look crossed his face. ``Armando Dorticos, no?'' he
answers, not realizing that Dorticos is a former president, that his
first name was Osvaldo, that he died several years ago and that the
current president is Fidel Castro.

   Fifteen ``skinheads'' were sentenced
Thursday to stiff jail terms for a racial attack on 10 Cuban workers
at a streetcar stop in Budapest, a newspaper reported.
   A youth identified as Andras Dudas, ringleader of the attack
after a punk rock concert April 24, received three years, four
months in strict-regime prisons on charges of ``grievous bodily harm
and racist incitement against foreign workers,'' the newspaper Esti
Hirlap said.
   Six of his associates received jail terms ranging between 2{ and
3{ years on similar charges, the newspaper said. Eight minors were
given suspended sentences.
   The Cubans suffered cuts and bruises.
   The youths confessed to being ``skinheads pervaded by extreme
nationalist and racist views,'' the newspaper said. The jail terms
were especially stiff because of the charge of incitement to racial
hatred, Esti Hirlap added.

   A California ballot measure that would force
doctors and blood banks to report positive AIDS-test results would
discourage people from participating in research, U.S. Surgeon
General C. Everett Koop said.
   ``It would drive people who could participate in drug trials away
from research and underground,'' Koop said. ``Everything we have
done may step backwards five years.''
   Proposition 102 is ``contrary to every principle of public health
I know,'' Koop said in Wednesday's San Francisco Examiner.
   The proposition will be on the ballot Tuesday along with a
measure, Proposition 96, that would allow judges to order AIDS tests
for people accused of sex crimes.
   In a poll of 600 registered California voters, 41 percent favored
Proposition 102, 28 percent opposed it and 31 percent were
undecided, the newspaper said.
   Proposition 96 was favored by 47 percent and opposed by 28
percent, with 25 percent undecided. The margin of error was four
percentage points.

Controversy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The national Republican Senatorial
Committee ordered a U.S. Senate candidate to yank a campaign
commercial that shows a bloody fetus side by side with Senate
Majority Leader Robert Byrd.
   Byrd, D-W.Va., said Wednesday that GOP challenger Jay Wolfe's
television advertisement was ``contemptible'' and ``an outrage.''
   ``It sensationalizes a very serious issue just for the sake of
political shock value,'' Byrd said.
   The 30-second spot, which prompted complaints from viewers,
opened with a closeup of a bloody fetus, then showed a picture of
Byrd next to that of the fetus.
   Wolfe, a first-term state senator, defended the commercial. When
asked if it upset viewers, Wolfe responded, ``I was upset when I
realized what was going on (with abortions). I think it's in poor
taste that (Byrd) has ... consistently voted for abortion.''
   Byrd said the commercial distorted his record on abortion, adding
that he believes federal funding for abortions is warranted in cases
of rape or incest or where the life of the mother is endangered by
the pregnancy.
   The commercial listed as its sponsor the Republican Senatorial
Committee, but the group, the political arm of the U.S. Senate
Republican leadership, denied any involvement.
   Committee spokesman Tom Mason said Wolfe was not authorized to
broadcast the ad with committee funds.
   ``It's the only ad ... that we've refused to pay for,'' Mason
said. ``That should tell you what we think of it. We talked to the
campaign and told them to pull the ads.''
   ``I think the ad is disgusting, deplorable and never should have
been run,'' said Summersville Mayor Steve LeRose, a member of the
state Republican committee.
   ``I am against abortion except in the case of a life-or-death
situation to the mother. ... But to have a political ad show a fetus
like this is totally disgusting to me and, I'm sure, to many people
in the state.''
   Wolfe said he will continue to run the advertisement but drop the
senatorial committee's name and replace it with his own.
   Several television stations said they received calls from viewers
and referred them to Wolfe's campaign office.
   ``People were irate. They said it was rather a disgusting ad,''
said Ruth Damron, a receptionist at WOWK-TV in Huntington.
   Stan Siegal, general manager of WBOY-TV in Clarksburg, said his
station received 50 to 75 telephone calls from viewers since the ad
began running Monday.
   ``They're mostly upset with the content of the commercial and
second, they generally ask, `Would you control what time it airs so
children don't see it?' The general public does not understand TV
stations have no control over what the ads say,'' he said.
   Wolfe said he wrote the ad copy. He said he received about 60
calls from around the state during the past two days ``both for it
and against it.''
   He said he spent more than $100,000 running seven ads, including
the one on abortion. He said about 80 percent of the money came from
the Republican Senatorial Committee.
   Bill Green, an attorney for the National Association of
Broadcasters, said federal law forbids stations from censoring the
content of political advertisements in which the candidate appears.
He also said stations cannot be held liable for the contents of such
an ad.

   An estimated 3,000 malnourished cattle and
the carcasses of 50 that starved to death have been discovered on a
ranch.
   Kaufman County Sheriff Robert Harris said authorities were trying
to identify the owner, who could face charges of animal cruelty.
   Harris' office began rounding up the animals today for a
veterinarian to determine which can be saved.
   Some of the cattle discovered Wednesday were so malnourished they
could not walk.
   ``Their ribs were showing,'' Harris said. ``A lot of them were
completely down. Some can't even see _ they're starved so much that
they're blind.''
   He said workers on the ranch had no feed for the animals.

   A federal grand jury has indicted an
Iranian national on charges he tried to ship a component of a U.S.
missile system to Iran, officials say.
   Ali Reza Yousefi, who was fired from his job as a Rock Hill city
engineer after his Oct. 19 arrest, was indicted Wednesday on three
counts that include trying to mail the part, conspiracy and making
false statements on an application for a passport.
   Yousefi, 45, is being held without bond. He is accused of trying
to export a cathode assembly for a Klystom Tube, part of the
tracking and targeting system of the Hawk missile.
   U.S. Customs officials said it was believed the package was
destined for Iran because the part could only fit Hawk missiles sold
to Iran before the fall of the shah in 1980.
   The indictment also charges that Yousefi, whose business visa
expired two years ago, stated on a passport application that he had
been in the United States since July 1969 and was a naturalized U.S.
citizen.
   The charges are the result of a misunderstanding, said Jack
Swerling, Yousefi's attorney. He said Yousefi believes he'll be
found innocent.
   Yousefi could face up to 20 years in prison and a $1.5 million
fine if convicted of all the charges.

   The 1,100-pound bomb had two functional detonaters and was

   It was found Wednesday night 19 feet underground by workers
constructing a new subway tunnel beneath the zoo, the statement said.
   After the bomb was defused, it was removed by crane and taken

   Thousands of old bombs and other ammunition have been found and

<HEAD>Pentagon Turning to Military Hospitals to Treat Dependents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon, hoping to contain the cost of its
health insurance plan for dependents and retirees, has approved 21
projects aimed at expanding the capacity of military hospitals to
handle such patients.
   The approvals, given by Assistant Defense Secretary William
Mayer, will allow Army and Air Force hospitals in 12 states to
expand facilities or hire additional nurses and other staff to
provide more surgical, obstetrics, gynecology, cardiology and
psychiatry services.
   Similar Navy projects are now under consideration.
   The Pentagon estimates the new projects will cost the two
services $14.6 million, but that the Defense Department will still
save $13.9 million compared with the cost of paying civilian
hospitals to treat the patients under the Civilian Health and
Medical Program of the Uniformed Services, an insurance program.
   Military hospitals are required to serve dependents and retirees
on a space-available basis, giving first priority to men and women
on active duty.
   ``These projects are expected to generate savings of
approximately $14 million by returning nearly 1,000 admissions and
20,000 outpatient visits to military treatment facilities,'' the
Pentagon said.
   The hospitals receiving approvals _ some of which have more than
one project planned _ include Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Fort
Gordon, Ga.; William Beaumont Army Medical Center, El Paso, Texas;
DeWitt Army Community Hospital, Fort Belvoir, Va.; Walson Army
Community Hospital, Fort Dix, N.J.; Darnall Army Community Hospital,
Fort Hood, Texas; Ireland Army Community Hospital, Fort Knox, Ky.;
Patterson Army Community Hospital, Fort Monmouth, N.J., Irwin Army
Community Hospital, Fort Riley, Kansas, and Winn Army Community
Hospital, Fort Stewart, Ga.
   Also, the USAF Hospital at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska; the
USAF Hospital at Tinker AFB, Okla.; the USAF Hospital at Hill AFB,
Utah; the 380th Strategic Hospital at Plattsburgh AFB, N.Y.; the
Ehrling Bergquist USAF Regional Hospital at Offutt AFB, Neb., and
the AFSC Regional Hospital at Eglin AFB, Fla.

<HEAD>Beckley Says He's `Out Of Gas,' His Company Ordered Liquidated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Self-proclaimed ``millionaire maker'' Ed
Beckley is pulling out of Iowa and not contesting the court-ordered
liquidation of his real estate marketing company.
   Beckley made millions in the mid-1980s by selling real estate on
television programs that carried inspirational testimonials and
promises of financial freedom. But Beckley Group Inc. found itself
awash in claims for refunds after instituting a six-month,
money-back guarantee.
   In 1987, the company sought court protection from creditors while
it tried to reorganize its finances under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy code.
   The company still lost $601,000 last year, and it pulled its
programs off the air two weeks ago in what turned out to be an
unsuccessful shift to direct-mail marketing of its courses.
   The Iowa attorney general, on behalf of consumers, asked that the
case be converted to Chapter 7, a liquidation, and the shutdown was
approved in federal bankruptcy court Wednesday with Beckley's
consent.
   ``I'm sort of a battler, but I'm out of gas here,'' said Beckley,
a California native who in 1985 joined the transcendental meditation
movement in Fairfield, the home of Maharishi International
University.
   ``I'll leave Iowa peaceably, get a little rest and try to figure
out what I'm going to do,'' he said.
   Beckley said he is writing a book about spiritual and financial
wealth.
   The court action means the assets of Beckley Group will be sold
to pay claims of creditors. But Donald Neiman, a lawyer for Beckley,
said it's unlikely the company will be able to repay 10,000
customers seeking $2.6 million in refunds.
   The Iowa attorney general's office still is suing Beckley for
consumer refunds, and the bankruptcy court trustee said he looking
into possible action to recover $2.4 million Beckley owes the
company. Terry Gibson, a lawyer for the trustee, said officials are
particularly interested in $455,000 in stock and real estate
transfers made to Beckley's wife.
   Beckley said those transfers were made before the first signs of
trouble at Beckley Group and denied that he tried to shield his
wealth from the courts.
   Beckley earned $7.2 million from the company in 1985 and 1986,
but said most of that is gone.
   He said he violated one of his own real estate principles by
allowing others to manage his investments and wound up losing $3.5
million. He also said he put $1.7 million back into the company.
   Beckley blames himself for his company's collapse, but contends
the attorney general's office ruined the chances for the company's
recovery and the repayment of its customers.
   ``They were intent on crucifying ... me,'' Beckley said. ``We are
not bad people, we are not criminals. I felt like we were treated as
such.''

<HEAD>US Weighs Options In Dispute With Soviets Over Radar Facility</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet refusal to destroy a disputed Siberian
radar facility is prompting the Reagan administration to consider
expanding strategic weapons programs, U.S. officials said Thursday.
   Among the steps being weighed are reversing the planned
dismantling of three Poseidon nuclear submarines, deploying a
limited ballistic missile defense and speeding up the testing of
space weapons, said the officials, who spoke only on condition of
anonymity.
   They said a decision was expected within two weeks. ``The jury is
still out,'' an official said.
   In the meantime, William F. Burns, director of the U.S. Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency, plans to begin briefing members of
Congress on Friday on failure to resolve the dispute with the
Soviets.
   Acting on a request from the White House last summer, the options
were prepared by the Pentagon and are being circulated to the State
Department, the arms control agency and other U.S. offices for their
recommendations.
   On Wednesday, U.S. and Soviet technical experts in Geneva
discussed the radar installation at Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, and a
Soviet proposal to construct a space institute there.
   The U.S. group, headed by Burns, had no objection to the idea of
an institute but said the Krasnoyarsk facility had to be dismantled.
After the Soviets refused, State Department spokesman Charles E.
Redman said the United States may take ``appropriate and
proportionate responses'' or declare Krasnoyarsk a ``material
breach'' of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
   That would be a first step toward abrogating the arms control
accord.
   ``Unfortunately, the Soviet experts did not have any new
proposal,'' Redman said Wednesday in giving an account of the
session.
   In two reports to Congress, the administration charged the
Soviets with violating the ABM treaty by constructing a radar
facility that could be used to organize a national defense against
missile attack.
   The theory behind the treaty is that if both sides were unable to
mount a defense they would hesitate to launch an attack. Otherwise,
their territory and populations would be open to devastating
retaliation.
   The Geneva session was held at the Soviets' request. Viktor P.
Karpov, the foreign ministry's senior arms control specialist, had
said in July that the Soviets would dismantle the Krasnoyarsk radar
if the two sides resolved their differences over the 1972 treaty.
   ``We had hoped they were prepared to meet U.S. concerns about the
radar,'' Redman said. ``... We listened to what they had to say.
Unfortunately, the Soviet experts did not have any new proposals.''

<HEAD>Pakistan Says it Shot Down Afghan Warplane</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pakistan said it shot down an
intruding Afghan warplane Thursday inside its borders, and
Afghanistan said Pakistani jet fighters downed two aircraft in
Afghan territory.
   Western diplomats also reported Thursday that communist forces
fired six missiles at Afghan guerrillas near the border.
   The stepped-up activity in the 10-year-old Afghan war follows
Wednesday's capture by guerrillas of a key Afghan frontier post and
the introduction by Soviet forces of new long-range missiles.
   Neither Afghanistan's Soviet-backed government or Pakistan
acknowledged the other's claims of border air battles, but both
lodged official protests. It was not clear whether they were
reporting on the same attacks.
   The Pakistani government said a U.S.-built Pakistani F-16 shot
down a Soviet-made Su-22 fighter-bomber Thursday morning when two
Su-22's penetrated 10 miles into Pakistan's North-West Frontier
province.
   The Pakistani government said an Afghan pilot was captured and
was being questioned. Pakistan television showed film of the
wreckage near the village of Thal, about 160 miles west of Islamabad.
   However, Afghanistan's official Radio Kabul later said Pakistani
F-16s shot down an Afghan reconaissance jet in the morning and a
training jet in the afternoon.
   The Afghan report, monitored in Islamabad Thursday night, said
both attacks came near the city of Khost, about 12 miles inside
Afghanistan. It did identify the type of Afghan planes involved.
   Khost is about 36 miles southwest of the Pakistani village of
Thal.
   The Afghan radio said the communist authorities protested to
Pakistan over the alleged Pakistani downing of the planes inside
Afghanistan.
   Pakistan's Foreign Ministry summoned the Afghan charge d'affaires
and launched a ``strong protest'' about the Pakistani claims of an
air incursion, officials said.
   The ministry later summoned Soviet Ambassador V.P. Yakunin to
protest this week's deployment of the new missiles and other
advanced aircraft and weapons in Afghanistan, Pakistani television
said.
   Western diplomats in Islamabad reported that communist forces
have fired at least six new Soviet SS-1 missiles at guerrilla
positions close to the boundary.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass reported that Soviet-Afghan
forces fired a ``powerful missile'' Wednesday night at a guerrilla
base near the border.
   Late Wednesday, the guerrillas claimed they captured the town of
Tokram from government forces after two days of fighting. Afghan
guerrillas said they gained control of about 24 miles of the road
leading west to the besieged city of Jalalabad in Afghanistan's
Nangarhar province.
   Despite the raging civil war between the guerrillas and
Soviet-Afghan forces, Pakistan had allowed non-military goods to
pass through its territory to Torkham, at the foot Pakistan's Khyber
Pass.
   However, guerrillas announced Thursday they were closing the road
to commercial traffic, which could cause shortages of basic
commodities in Jalalabad and Kabul, the Afghan capital.
   The United States, which backs the guerrillas along with
Pakistan, has complained over the Soviet introduction of advanced
aircraft and weapons in Afghanistan. The State Department called it
a dangerous escalation of the war and a violation of a U.N. accord
that provides for a Soviet troop withdrawal.
   In April, the Soviet Union agreed to remove its troops from
Afghanistan by Feb. 15, 1989. Moscow met its pledge to withdraw the
first half of it forces by Aug. 15, according to U.N. observers, but
no major units have left since then.
   The Soviets intervened in Afghanistan in December 1979.

<HEAD>West Europeans Meeting With Soviets To Discuss Possible Trade Pact</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West European nations began a round of
talks Thursday with the Soviet Union to expand economic ties, but a
top European official said the West would move cautiously.
   ``We should not throw away 30 years of cautious approach with
Eastern Europe just in a wave of sudden optimism (or) a wave of
naivete,'' said Willy De Clercq, the top trading official of the
12-nation European Economic Community.
   ``I don't think it's our feeling to do that,'' he said.
   Thu trading bloc opened two days of discussions with a Soviet
delegation led by Ivan Ivanov, vice president of the Soviet state
commission for foreign economic affairs.
   The meetings, described as exploratory talks, are designed to get
a feeling for what each side would like to see in any agreement
later worked out in negotiations.
   During previous contacts, the Soviets indicated they would be
interested in an agreement with the wealthier European countries
covering a wide variety of areas, including high technology. The
transfer of such sensitive technology to Moscow is tightly
controlled.
   ``They asked for everything,'' De Clercq said in an interview
before the talks. ``It is a question if the community can accept or
will accept .. so broad a cooperation that is very likely going to
be asked.''
   De Clercq said an agreement with the Soviet Union could cover
cooperation in the environment, energy, transportation and exchange
of information and statistics.
   West European businessmen are interested in gaining greater
access to the Soviet marketplace, he said.
   The trading bloc, also known as the Common Market, generally
works out agreements with other countries that lead to greater
trade. But the Soviet Union has limited products that West European
countries would be interested in buying.
   De Clercq said any serious negotiations on such a pact likely
would not take place until next year at the earliest.
   The Common Market nations imported $15.2 billion in goods from
the Soviet Union in 1987 and had exports totaling $10.7 billion,
according to EEC figures.
   The improved East-West relationship has raised some concern that
Moscow will gain access to high technology that could improve its
military might.
   ``There is this concern about transfer of technology,'' said
Alfred H. Kingon, U.S. ambassador to the European Economic Community.
   ``We all feel strongly that whatever is happening in Eastern
Europe could be used to our mutual advantage,'' he said.
   The export of sensitive Western technology such as supercomputers
is controlled by the 16-nation Coordinating Committee for
Multilateral Export Controls, which maintains a list of items
embargoed for export to the Soviet bloc.
   The discussions with the Soviets are the latest in a series
recent trade talks the community has held with the East.
   In June, the Common Market signed a declaration establishing
official relations with the 10-nation Soviet-led socialist economic
bloc, called the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance.
   In September, the Common Market signed a trade and economic
cooperation agreement with Hungary and recently finished
negotiations on a trade accord with Czechoslovakia.
   Common Market members are Britain, Ireland, Denmark, France,
Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Portugal,
Italy and Greece.

<TEXT>
   Polls indicate men like George Bush better than
Michael Dukakis, a gender gap that analysts say Bush has
successfully reinforced by depicting the Democrat as soft on crime
and defense.
   Much has been made of the other gender gap _ the one that finds
women favoring Democrats over Republican presidential candidates _
but polling data also shows that men have a distinct set of
standards by which they measure the two candidates.
   Houston-based Republican pollster Lance Tarrance said Bush struck
a chord among male voters with television advertisements that
attacked Dukakis.
   ``Men tend to be far more concerned with preserving the status
quo. Men also can be appealed to on so-called macho issues, such
things as national defense and the crime issues,'' Tarrance said.
   The attacks seem to have driven home with male voters, because
``They make a stronger decision on who they don't want ... women
make a stronger decision on who they do want,'' Tarrance said.
   He said men also were suspicious of Dukakis because they sensed
``there was more to Dukakis than he was letting us know,'' and they
did not know what that something was. In addition, Bush tapped into
a male penchant for a more structured analysis of things that made
them lean away from what they saw as a lack of national experience
on the part of Dukakis.
   ``Experience really counts strongly with men,'' Tarrance said.
   The very fact that Bush put Dukakis on the defensive for weeks
and thus was able to set the agenda for the campaign gave him status
as a strong leader, a factor which also attracted men, said Ethel
Klein, associate professor of political science at Columbia
University.
   ``Men really don't think he's strong,'' she said of Dukakis.
``Every time Michael Dukakis has had a chance to define himself,
he's let Bush define him.'' She cited Dukakis' now-famous tank ride,
following a drumbeat of soft-on-defense attacks from Bush.
   Klein said Bush ``put the Democrats in a me-too position. He's
been on the offensive all along,'' and that was a strong message
that men liked.
   In recent polls both men and women favor Bush over Dukakis, but
the margin for men is greater.
   The latest ABC News-Washington Post poll showed Bush preferred by
56 percent of men, 40 percent of women. The most recent CBS News-New
York Times survey put Bush's advantage among men at 56-39.
   Pollster Louis Harris said men seem to be drawn to Bush in large
part because he is the only alternative to Dukakis, whom Bush has
succeeded in portraying negatively.
   ``What Bush did was to make it reactive against Dukakis, because
Bush doesn't have the same inspirational qualities that Ronald
Reagan has. Reagan was able to inspire men. Now men are able to
react against Dukakis,'' said Harris.
   Political analyst William Schneider, however, contended that the
male penchant for Bush is really just a reflection of a pattern that
has emerged for several years now.
   ``It has to do with the image of the parties,'' and the role of
government in people's lives, he said.
   ``Women support a protective government,'' identified with the
Democrats, while men agree more with the Republican push to shrink
government, he said.
   ``It has very little to do with Bush and Dukakis and a great deal
to do with the direction the parties have moved in.''

   The town of Purdy waltzed ever closer to its
first school dance in a century.
   A federal appeals court refused to block a Purdy High School
homecoming dance planned for Dec. 10, William Fleischaker, an
attorney for the students and parents who successfully challenged
the district's ban on dancing, said today.
   Earlier this year, a federal judge in Springfield struck down the
ban, saying it unconstitutionally promoted religious values.
   The Purdy School Board appealed the decision to the 8th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis and asked it to stay the
judge's ruling in order to prevent a dance from taking place while
it considers the appeal.
   But Fleischaker said the court denied a stay Monday.
   ``There's no way the appeal will be decided between now and then
(Dec. 10),'' he said. ``So we'll be moving forward, and they (school
officials) have indicated they will cooperate.''
   Schools Superintendent Sheldon Buxton this morning said he had
not yet been informed of the appellate court ruling.

   Sen. Dan Quayle is settling uncomfortably
into his role as loyal No. 2 to George Bush, grousing about a lack
of national media coverage and sudden schedule changes dictated by
headquarters.
   He acknowledged that whatever George Bush wants, George Bush will
get. Even when that meant Quayle will await the presidential
election returns in Washington instead of his hometown of
Huntington, as first planned.
   ``I'm learning. I'm a quick study,'' he told reporters Tuesday
night. Quayle related that Bush thought one of the two should be in
Washington on election night, but the candidate at the top of the
ticket was determined to watch the returns back in his adopted Texas.
   ``If he wants to be in Houston, he'll be in Houston,'' Quayle
said. ``I've got a lot of friends in Washington, so I'll go there.''
   Through the last week of the campaign, Quayle repeatedly voiced
the Republican gospel about not taking victory for granted. But he
also dealt with questions about what kind of vice president he would
be.
   ``I think my role will be very much like George Bush's role,'' he
said. ``The way he served Ronald Reagan was helpful to the
implementation of his policies.''
   ``My image is not important. What's important is George Bush's
image.''
   The transformation of Quayle has been marked. He groaned to
reporters this week that he cannot get national media exposure.
``Put me on the air,'' he exhorted a network television producer.
This, from the politician who three months ago suffered through the
most negative campaign publicity since Gary Hart.
   Ironically, as Quayle voiced irritation with his lesser-light
role, Bush campaign aides and even some Quayle staffers rejoiced
that the controversial Quayle of August had graduated to the
position of ordinary vice presidential candidate.
   ``It indicates that he is now campaigning in about the mode we
have always learned to expect from vice presidential candidates,''
said Mitch Daniels, a former Reagan White House political director
who is constantly at Quayle's side on the campaign trail.
   ``Traditionally, no No. 2 candidate attracts regular national
coverage, but they're always news in all but the biggest media
markets.''
   Quayle, nevertheless, complained about last-minute schedule
changes dictated by Bush campaign headquarters in Washington. And
the man who sought to avoid reporters in the torrid days of August,
amid heavy questioning about his past, now took pains to be
accessible to the press.
   When the Bush campaign bumped South Bend, Ind., from Quayle's
schedule Tuesday, because the vice president was appearing at the
University of Notre Dame, the senator used the spare time to host a
luncheon for traveling reporters.
   Besides canceling the appearance in South Bend, Quayle had to
call off a planned trip to Missouri and North Carolina, and he
traveled to South Carolina instead. Not all of the campaign schedule
changes were keyed to presidential vote-getting strategy.
   Quayle aide Lanny Wiles said, ``It's a kind of dartboard
technique. ... The last week of the campaign, if you over-commit (to
appearances) you leave ill will, so you leave room on your schedule
so you can add on. It's always been that way.''
   But Wiles then said the major aim of Quayle's South Carolina
appearance was to help a Republican trying to wrest from a Democrat
a congressional seat once held by Gov. Carroll Campbell. ``You know,
Carroll is a good friend of George Bush's,'' he said.
   Quayle took all of this in stride, even with his complaints,
telling an audience in Jeffersonville, Ind. at one point ``that
schedule of mine changes every minute. Wherever that plane,
`Hoosier's Pride' goes, I'll be right on it.''
   Daniels said that Quayle has been spending his days in small
towns and some out-of-the-way spots, not to hide him but to appeal
to voters in less populated areas.
   ``He's a small town guy, just like Ronald Reagan (a Dixon, Ill.
native),'' Daniels said. ``The Republican Party is a party of the
small town.''
   While he tries to stymie any urge for more national attention and
big-city campaign galas, Quayle says he's surmounted questions about
the circumstances under which he joined the Indiana National Guard
at the height of the Vietnam War in 1969 and questions about his
academic performance at Depauw University and Indiana University law
school.
   Quayle said that while he believes some of the reporting about
his past was reckless and irresponsible, news reporters ``had a very
short time to examine me, ... a hurry-up, rush situation. So it's
not their fault.''
   To those who may harbor lingering doubts about his fitness for
high office, he says, ``Give me a chance.''

   Burt Lancaster, who celebrated his 75th birthday
this week, says blockbuster movie stardom may be past, but
first-class roles are still available.
   ``I look for certain special things to come along,'' Lancaster
says in an interview in this weekend's Parade magazine.
   It may be ``a little cameo now and then, or a big picture ... big
in a sense of the role it offers,'' he said.
   An example, he said, is his part in ``Rocket Gibraltar,'' a movie
about a family gathering to celebrate a man's 77th birthday.
   ``But you have to recognize that you're not the young leading man
or the box-office star you used to be, and the picture is not going
to sit on your shoulders 100 percent,'' he said.
   ``It's a natural diminution of power, energy, things of that
kind, and the realization that new people are coming up who will
take the spotlight. You have to step aside for them.''

   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ East German figure skating star
Katarina Witt debuted as a professional in the U.S.-owned Holiday on
Ice show, where she will draw record pay on a nine-week tour.
   Witt, 22, was featured as an Indian princess Wednesday night in a
production based on Jules Verne's novel ``Around The World In 80
Days.'' The show also will play Vienna, Stockholm and two West
German cities, Dortmund and Munich between now and February.
   Show officials confirmed that the two-time Olympic champion will
get the highest fee ever paid but said reports that the fee to her
and the East German sports federation would total $3.8 million were
exaggerated.
   Witt is the first skater from communist East Germany to join a
Western ice revue, show spokesman Ernesto Sartori said. She and her
coach designed her own segments, including two solo spots in the
2{-hour show.
   Witt retired from competition after winning her second Olympic
gold medal at the Calgary Winter Games last February.
   She has said she intends to take acting lessons and is undecided
on whether to continue as an ice revue performer after her first
season.

   Conductor Jesus Lopez Cobos announced his
resignation Thursday as musical director of the Spanish National
Orchestra, citing unreconcilable differences with the management.
   Lopez Cobos said he gave notice that he planned to resign Sunday,
after a leading Spanish newspaper quoted several administrators of
the state-run orchestra as saying he devotes too little time and
energy to his duties.
   The conductor said he would step down Jan. 30 after fulfilling
remaining contractual obligations, and would focus on his other
posts as Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra music director, general music
director of the Berlin Opera and director of a chamber music group
in Switzerland.
   Lopez Cobos, 48, who has directed the Spanish orchestra for eight
years, rejected charges that the orchestra had performed poorly in
recent concerts because of insufficient rehearsal.
   ``I have tried my best to improve the national orchestra and
chorus, artistically and socially, even when it worked to the
detriment of my professional career outside Spain,'' he said.
   The conductor said 100 orchestra members had signed a statement
supporting him.

   A Soviet official said Thursday that Soviet Jews
won't be participating in the World Jewish Congress any time soon,
although ``initial contacts'' have been made.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov also said the
Soviets will allow private teaching of Hebrew, once punished as a
crime in the Soviet Union.
   Gerasimov was commenting on Wednesday's announcement by an
official of the World Jewish Congress that Soviet officials had
agreed to allow the teaching of Hebrew and permit the country's 1.8
million Jews to participate in the international organization.
   A working knowledge of Hebrew is considered an essential part of
the religious instruction given to every Jew, but Soviet laws on the
books bar the private teaching of religious subjects to anyone under
18.
   Gerasimov told a government news briefing that Hebrew has been
taught as a foreign language at Moscow, Leningrad and Tbilisi
universities and now private instruction would be allowed.
   The Foreign Ministry spokesman said Soviet Jews are just
beginning to organize within the country.
   Gerasimov said officials of the international Jewish group were
told by Konstantin Kharchev, chairman of the government's Council
for Religious Affairs, that such groups now have ``only initial
contacts with the World Jewish Congress and it was too early to
speak about possible developments.''
   Elan Steinberg, executive director of the World Jewish Congress,
said Thursday that ``we have overcome the unwillingness'' of Soviet
authorities to allow Soviet Jews to participate in the international
body.
   He said Soviet Jews have no national organization yet that could
affiliate with the umbrella group, which represents Jewish groups
from 70 countries whose combined Jewish populations total 11 million
to 12 million.
   On Wednesday, following talks with Soviet officials, Steinberg
said Soviet authorities had agreed ``that the Soviet Jewish
community can participate in the activities of the World Jewish
Congress.''
   He said at the time that the exact form of participation remained
to be worked out.
   Steinberg also said the teaching of Hebrew would be allowed again.
   The unsanctioned teaching of Hebrew was once treated here as a
criminal offense, and several Jewish activists went to prison for
giving unauthorized instruction in the language. They included Josef
Begun, who was allowed to emigrate to Israel this year.
   However, an agreement signed by the Ministry of Culture to
establish the first Jewish cultural center in the Soviet Union in
more than 50 years says the building may be used in its ``second
phase'' for classes in Hebrew and Yiddish, Steinberg said.
   At Thursday's briefing, Gerasimov also said that 15,700 Soviet
Jews received permanent exit visas in the first nine months of 1988.
   In October, Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union reached an
8{-year high, with 2,473 Jews allowed to leave, according to the
Geneva-based Intergovernmental Committee for Migration.

<HEAD>Government Defense Visa For Man Suspected Of War Crimes</HEAD>

   The government on Thursday defended its
decision to issue an entry visa to a former U.S. resident accused of
war crimes, saying the man had valid travel documents and was not
charged in the United States.
   Boleslav Maikovskis was detained Oct. 19 in Muenster, where he
was living while awaiting a decision on a request for political
asylum in West Germany. He is being held in prison while war crimes
prosecutors investigate the allegations against him.
   Before coming to West Germany in November 1987, Maikovskis, 84,
had lived in Mineola, N.Y.
   ``This man possessed a valid passport that allowed him re-entry
into the United States,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Reinhard
Bettzuege said.
   ``Mr. Maikovskis was issued a visa of limited duration based on
the validity of his passport. He had requested entry to pursue legal
matters,'' Bettzuege added.
   Bettzuege said he did not know details of Maikovskis' legal
matters.
   The Soviet Union in 1965 sentenced Maikovskis to death in
absentia for his alleged role in burning down a village and helping
murder more than 130 people in the Latvian village of Audrine.
   The United States began deportation proceedings against him in
1976, but they were held up by several appeals. His last appeal was
denied by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1986.
   Maikovskis' visa was issued by the West German consulate in New
York, Bonn officials said.
   West German government sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, noted that U.S. officials had not seized Maikovskis'
passport and had not brought charges against him.
   ``At the time of departure, Maikovskis was free to come and go as
he pleased to the United States,'' said a government source.
   ``If U.S. officials had really wanted him that badly, they could
have easily gotten him long before he left the country,'' the source
told The Associated Press.
   Last month, the U.S. Justice Department's Office of Special
Investigations said it had lost track of Maikovskis and had just
discovered he had left the country.
   Maikovskis was granted a visa based on a passport issued by the
Latvian government in exile.

<HEAD>5-Year-Old Must Walk to School While Older Brother Gets A Bus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Janet Kiesner's 5-year-old son must walk to the
same school his older brother goes to by bus because of a district
policy designed to keep down costs.
   ``It's so dumb. I'd never have enrolled him (in kindergarten) .
.. if I had known this would happen,'' said Kiesner, who doesn't
drive. ``But now he loves it and I don't want to pull him out.''
   Her son Joey is not permitted to take the bus because the
Milwaukee Public Schools System prohibits the busing of children in
its kindergarten classes for 4-year-olds if the youngsters live less
than a mile from school. Older pupils, including those in
kindergarten for 5-year-olds, get bus service.
   The problem, according to Richard F. Wenzel, assistant director
of transportation for the district, is state law. It requires that
if bus transportation were provided for pupils in 4-year-old
kindergarten, it would have to be offered to all children in that
age group.
   ``That would include 4-year-olds at day-care centers all over the
city as well as to five miles outside the city,'' Wenzel said.
``There would be quite a financial impact.''
   ``If it's too hazardous for a 5-year-old or my third-grader to
walk, certainly it's too dangerous for a 4-year-old,'' said a
frustrated Kiesner, whose 8-year-old son gets bused to the same
school.
   She said she walks a neighbor's daughter, a 5-year-old
kindergarten pupil, to her bus stop each day, waits for the bus to
pick up the girl and then walks her younger son about six blocks
along a busy city street to get him to the same school.
   ``To put one little kid on that bus and then have to walk my own
child up to the same school seems ridiculous,'' Kiesner said.
   ``It's not like I'm asking for a special bus. It already stops
right here and there's plenty of room,'' she said.
   School officials said they would like to bus Joey, but they are
restricted by the school board's policy. And even though Joey has
turned 5, he is still covered by the policy because he remains
enrolled in 4-year-old kindergarten.
   The board has directed Superintendent Robert S. Peterkin to
review the district's student assignment process, but Peterkin said
no changes are likely to be made until 1990-91.
   School officials said there are two options for Kiesner.
   She can select another school farther from her home. According to
Wenzel, busing is provided to youngsters in 4-year-old kindergarten
if they attend a school more than a mile from home and their
attendance enhances the school's racial balance.
   But Kiesner said she wants to keep her two children in the same
school. ``I feel better knowing he (Joey) is in the same school with
his brother.''
   The second option, Wenzel said, is for Kiesner to negotiate a
private contract with the bus company. A bus company spokesman
estimated such a contract would cost about $2.50 a day.
   ``That's beyond my budget. I couldn't afford that,'' Kiesner said.

   Three contestants in the Mrs. America
pageant have complained about being given a survey to fill out on
their love lives.
   According to Mrs. Alabama Diane Gamble, Mrs. Wisconsin Gale
Coleman and Mrs. North Carolina Connie Hedrick, the survey included
such questions as ``Can you be in love with two men at the same
time?'' and ``Outside of the bedroom, where is the most unusual
place you have had romance with your husband?''
   Pageant president David Marmel said he had not seen the survey,
adding that they were used in the past to find out types of products
used by contestants for the product-marketing purposes of pageant
sponsors.
   Marmel said the women were not obliged to answer the questions.
   The three contestants also complained Tuesday about the use of
bikinis, saying the skimpy attire was degrading for a pageant
featurng mothers and professional women.
   ``How is it going to look for my fellow workers to see me bumping
and grinding in a bikini on national television? It's demeaning,
said Mrs. Gamble, a marketing director for an engineering firm.
   Only single-piece suits were used in state contests leading to
the national pageant, she said.
   Jennifer Kline, 21, of Minnesota, won the pageant that ended
Sunday and was televised Tuesday by ABC.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of students demanding the
arrest of former President Chun Doo-hwan clashed with riot police
Thursday in one of the worst street protests in recent months.
   President Roh Tae-woo, on an overseas trip, said he was not
troubled and hoped political turmoil in his country would end ``in
the not-too-distant future.''
   ``I am not much worried about the student protests. Their
complaints will eventually disappear in a huge melting furnace of
democratic political reforms,'' Roh told reporters aboard a plane
which took him to Malaysia, Australia, Indonesia and Brunei.
   Police said more than 20,000 students from 80 colleges took part
in anti-Chun campus rallies or street protests in Seoul and a dozen
provincial cities on Thursday, national students' day. They accused
the former president of corruption and violating human rights.
   About 50 students were arrested, mostly in Seoul, said police.
They gave no injury figures, but said some youths and policemen
suffered cuts and burns.
   In Seoul, about 5,000 students threw firebombs at 9,000 riot
police who blocked their march to Chun's house in a fashionable
residential district.
   Police in armored vans retaliated by firing barrages of tear gas.
   Many pedestrians and residents cried with pain and choked in a
dense fog of the acrid gas.
   Traffic came to a halt and most shops in the area closed as the
fierce fighting continued for several hours.
   All but a handful of protesters were kept well away from the
house. Four youths came within 50 yards of Chun's home and exploded
two crude homemade plastic explosives. The four were arrested by
police before they escaped.
   The students' anger appeared centered on the former president,
but they also berated his successor.
   ``Arrest Chun Doo-hwan. Punish (President) Roh Tae-woo,'' they
shouted.
   It was the worst political clash in Seoul since major
anti-American protests in the early summer.
   In about a dozen other provincial cities, including Pusan,
Chunchon, Suwon and Ansung, protesters threw firebombs at a police
sub-station, a prosecutor's office and a government party building.
No injuries or major damage were reported.
   Anti-government demonstrations have escalated in recent weeks
with radical students organizing ``Save-the-Nation Suicide Squads''
and threatening to raid Chun's house to press for his punishment.
   With public sentiment against Chun, his opponents have been
pressing for his arrest. The general antipathy has spilled over to
Roh, who critics say has been slow to investigate the corruption
charges.
   Roh and Chun, both former army generals, have been close friends
since they were classmates at Korea Military Academy in the 1950s.
Roh succeeded Chun, who stepped down at the end of a seven-year term
in February.
   Chun also is being investigated for his alleged role in putting
down a 1980 civil uprising in southern Kwangju city. About 200
people died in the military crackdown.

<HEAD>Vietnam Returns Remains Of U.S. MIAs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam returned Thursday what it
believes to be remains of 23 Americans missing from the Vietnam War,
a U.S. spokesman said.
   A military honor guard saluted solemnly as the remains, each in a
metal casket covered with a folded U.S. flag, were loaded onto a
U.S. Air Force C-141 transport plane on the sun-baked tarmac of
Hanoi's Noi Bai Airport, said Maj. Dan Trout.
   It was among the largest turnovers since the January 1973 Paris
Peace Accords ended U.S. military involvement in the war, in which
58,000 Americans died before the communists defeated the U.S.-backed
South Vietnam government in April 1975.
   The caskets were flown out of the Vietnamese capital en route to
Honolulu, where the U.S. Central Identification Laboratory will try
to confirm preliminary analyses by the Vietnamese.
   Trout, spokesman for the U.S. Pacific Command, said Vietnam
provided a list of some names and information on the remains, but he
had no other details.
   Sources said earlier that Vietnam has given the United States at
least nine names.
   Trout said among the remains are those of 21 troops the
Vietnamese found in their own searches and two soldiers recovered
during the first joint field investigation near Hanoi Sept. 25-Oct.
5.
   Another American military team returned to Bangkok on Thursday
after completing the second joint field investigation with the
Vietnamese to determine what happened to U.S. airmen lost in
northern Vietnam.
   Trout said since the Paris accords, the United States has
received the identified remains of 196 missing people, including 168
from Vietnam, 26 from Laos and two from China. That leaves 2,387
Americans missing in action in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
   In August 1987, Vietnam's Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach and a
special U.S. presidential envoy, retired Gen. John W. Vessey, agreed
to hasten cooperation on the issue.
   Thursday's turnover brought to 90 the number of suspected remains
Vietnam has provided since then. From them, the U.S. laboratory so
far has identified 25 missing Americans.
   Seven U.S. military specialists returned to Bangkok after the
joint field investigation during which they inspected U.S. warplane
crash sites and other areas near Hanoi, Trout said.
   ``They did not find any specific remains this time,'' he said.
   During the 10-day project, two joint teams searched areas, many
of them mountainous, in Son La, Ha Son Binh and Hai Hung provinces.
   As with the first joint investigation, they were trying to
resolve some of the 70 compelling ``discrepancy cases'' where the
United States says there is evidence that Vietnamese authorities
should have information, including on airmen who were captured but
never returned.
   Most American losses in northern Vietnam were airmen shot down
during bombing runs.
   Thach previously gave Americans until the end of November to
complete such investigations and repeated hopes the United States
will provide more help in resolving Vietnam's own humanitarian
problems. Hanoi is eager for development aid from Washington.
   U.S. officials say they hope the joint projects will break down
some of the deep mistrust that has marked dealings on the issue for
many years.

<HEAD>Fake Achilles Head Probably 20th-Century Copy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A marble head of Achilles once displayed at
the J. Paul Getty Museum as a 2,300-year-old work of art was
probably made this century by a student working from a plaster
model, an official said.
   The head, removed from view at the museum in October 1987 because
the museum believed it to be a fake, was probably copied from a cast
taken from a head on display at the National Archaeological Museum
in Athens, said Getty curator Marion True.
   The head was apparently also rejected as a fake in the early
1930s by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, according
to letters found at the Met last year by a curator researching a
different subject.
   ``The letters were just one more element in the whole detective
process. This correspondence was an important component,'' Lori
Starr, a spokeswoman for the museum, said Thursday.
   Ms. True said a painstaking study of the marble head by
scientists and art experts had answered many of the questions
surrounding the head of Achilles, a mythological hero slain by an
arrow to his heel.
   ``The head has always been a problem, but it's one thing to say a
thing is false and quite another to prove it,'' she said. `If you
condemn something, you have to support your argument.''
   Questions remain, however, including whether the museum was
knowingly misled by Parisian art dealer Michel de Bry, who sold the
piece to the Getty in 1979 for an undisclosed price. Published
reports placed the head's value at around $2.5 million.
   De Bry has been unavailable for comment.
   ``The museum has taken the necessary steps to return the head to
the seller,'' said Ms. Starr, refusing further comment. For now,
though, she said the bust was in storage.
   The marble head had been dated 350-340 B.C. and was believed to
have been created by the Greek sculptor and architect Skopas as a
temple decoration depicting a Trojan War scene.
   Many scholars had believed that the head, and another titled the
``Head of Achilles'' in the Greek museum, came from the same studio,
probably the same artist or the artist's assistant, and from the
same monument.
   But when placed side-by-side, the Getty head and the Greece
museum head proved to be too similar.
   Cross-section measurements of many parts of the two heads were
within a millimeter of each other, said Jerry Podany, conservator of
antiquities at Getty.
   ``It's an incredibly impressive copy,'' he said.
   Getty officials don't know who crafted the phony Achilles head,
but plaster casts were a popular teaching tool in the late 19th
century and early 20th century. Ms. True said that the precise
workmanship leads her to believe the head was made in the early 20th
century.
   Other evidence proving the head to be a fake were scientific
tests on the marble that found the Getty head was made of an
entirely different kind of marble than the Greek museum piece, said
Ms. True.
   With a $2.1 billion endowment from oil baron J. Paul Getty, the
Malibu museum is the richest art institution in the world.

   By rights, Chic Hecht ought to be on the
ropes. The Republican senator has committed numerous verbal gaffes,
been down by double digits in the polls and _ as Democratic
challenger Richard Bryan loves to point out _ been designated the
least effective member of the Senate.
   So why is this race, with less than a week to go until the Nov. 8
election, one of the most hotly contested in the nation?
   ``His survival has been even more spectacular than the Alaskan
whales,'' says Jann Olsten, director of the National Republican
Senatorial Committee, the party's Senate campaign arm.
   Hecht has climbed back to a virtual dead heat with Bryan,
according to recent polls. The incumbent has been spending heavily
on advertising and has brought in President Reagan to take advantage
of his state's heavily Republican character.
   Reagan made a whistle-stop visit to Reno this week, and Bryan
conceded it would give Hecht a ``bump'' of a few percentage points.
But he still predicted he would win the tight race.
   There had been a brief lull in the acrimony that had surfaced
early in the campaign, including references to Bryan's sex life and
Hecht's intelligence. But there were new accusations of lies and
distortions during a final debate this week.
   Hecht raised allegations that Lt. Gov. Bob Miller, who would take
over as governor should Bryan win the Senate seat, was linked to
organized crime figures.
   The outraged governor in turn accused Hecht of ``McCarthyism,
naked and blatant,'' and called the remarks ``character
assassination in the worst way.''
   He challenged Hecht to provide specifics. Hecht declined, saying
he based his statement on a newspaper article that reported Miller
had talked to people later exposed as organized crime figures.
   Hecht, 59, complained earlier in the campaign about news accounts
citing his verbal miscues. He once referred to a nuclear repository
to be located in Nevada as a ``nuclear suppository.'' And in a TV
interview last week he mixed up the meanings of the words ``overt''
and ``covert'' in describing his Army intelligence experience:
``Overt is what I did. That means you're undercover.'' Hecht is a
member of the Senate Intelligence Committee.
   And one Bryan ad pointed out that a Senate staff poll had ranked
his opponent at the bottom of the 100-member list for effectiveness.
   Bryan, 51, has sought to distance himself from Michael Dukakis
despite his earlier endorsement of the Democratic presidential
nominee. He says he supports the old liberalism of Franklin
Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy but calls himself a progressive rather
than a modern political liberal.
   Hecht says Bryan, by entering the Senate race, deserted voters
who elected him to a second four-year term as governor in 1986. As
part of the criticism, the Hecht camp continues to incorrectly say
Bryan would be the first Nevada governor to quit in mid-term to get
a U.S. Senate seat.
   Bryan repeatedly criticized Hecht for canceling a northern Nevada
debate. However, Bryan did much the same thing in his successful
1982 challenge of then-Gov. Bob List.
   Hecht outspent Bryan more than 2-to-1 during most of October,
according to federal reports filed by the two candidates. Hecht said
he spent nearly $1 million from Oct. 1 to Oct. 19, while Bryan spent
just over $416,000 in the same period.
   In addition to the heavy spending and the Reagan visit, Olsten's
Washington-based GOP campaign committee began airing new ``generic''
television ads in the closing week of the capaign.
   The spending blitz prompted Bryan to file a Federal Election
Commission complaint against Hecht in one case, to stop the American
Medical Association from spending more than $100,000 on Hecht's
behalf.
   But Hecht aides said the AMA political action committee spending
was independent of their campaign and charged Bryan was engaged in
``untruths'' to say Hecht and the AMA were trying to buy the
election.
   Also a potential boost to Hecht was George Bush's overwhelming
lead in the state, but Bryan campaign chief Sam Singer said Nevadans
won't blindly follow a GOP ticket down the line.
   Endorsements were mixed. The largest newspapers in the state were
divided, with the Las Vegas Review-Journal going for Hecht and the
Reno Gazette-Journal backing Bryan.
   Hecht, a Las Vegas businessman, upset Sen. Howard Cannon in 1982
after the incumbent was bloodied during a tough primary fight.
Cannon testified just before the election in the trials of
then-Teamsters president Roy Lee Williams and mob figure Allen
Dorfman.
   Bryan, also from Las Vegas, served in the state Legislature and
also as attorney general prior to his successful bid for governor in
1982 and re-election in 1986.

   The popular Colla Marionettes from Italy
return to the Spoleto Festival U.S.A. next season in a festival that
will offer selections from the traditional to the avante-garde.
   Officials announced Thursday the lineup for the 13th annual
festival, which includes a production of Mozart's ``The Marriage of
Figaro,'' a new production of the rarely performed opera ``La
Straniera'' by Bellini and the premiere of a dance-theater
production by Laurie Anderson.
   ``The 1988 festival set an extraordinarily high standard,''
festival General Manager Nigel Redden said. ``It was a stepping off
point for 1989 and I think 1989 will do it one better.''
   The dance program includes a new work, ``Tango-Orfeo,'' by
choreographer-director Graciela Daniele and Argentine tango composer
Astor Piazzolla.
   Dance offerings also include the young dance company ISO, the
Trisha Brown Company and the Bill T. Jones-Arnie Zane & Co. group.
   The Westminster Choir will perform Mozart's ``Requiem'' at the
festival which will be Joseph Flummerfelt's last as choral director
after 13 years with Spoleto.
   The theater offerings include a one-man show by Paul Zaloom who
takes a satirical look at contemporary life. The marionettes, who
performed before sold-out houses at the 1987 festival, also will
return.
   A major theater production will be announced later, as will the
festival jazz and visual arts programs, Redden said.
   There are no offerings from composer Gian Carlo Menotti, the
festival's artistic director, but Redden said Menotti is ``working
on something for the 1990 festival.''
   Redden added Spoleto will continue the recent trend of producing
more of its own productions and offering premieres.
   The Spoleto Festival U.S.A. runs May 26 through June 11, 1989.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said Thursday
that no climate exists for talks with authorities, and he won't
reply to a government proposal for a meeting until Britain's prime
minister ends her visit.
   Walesa said at a news conference that he received a letter from
Interior Minister Gen. Czesalaw on Wednesday.
   The letter invited Walesa to meet to remove obstacles to
convening long-promised talks between the government and
representatives of the outlawed Solidarity trade union movement.
   It was the first time Kiszczak approached Walesa directly about
setting up a meeting. Their previous three meetings since Aug. 31
were arranged by mediators.
   The state-run PAP news agency said Kiszczak proposed a meeting to
discuss ``the number and list of participants ..., the question of
chairing the debate and the sequence of speeches, press coverage and
time length'' of the proposed talks.
   Though he has not formulated his reply due to preparation for a
meeting with Prime Minster Margaret Thatcher, Walesa said he was
interested to meet Kiszczak to discuss ``important issues.''
   At St. Brygida's Church, where Mrs. Thatcher will dine with
Walesa and other Solidarity leaders Friday, workers put up a giant
Union Jack and a sign saying ``Solidarity Gdansk Welcomes Mrs.
Thatcher.''
   Walesa said he would repeat Solidarity's position that the
composition of his team to the talks is not open to discussion.
   ``If there are other subjects than our internal and personnel
problems, important problems, then I am ready to take up talks on
those subjects at any time. But talks cannot concern our internal
affairs,'' he said.
   Government objections to longtime Solidarity advisers Jacek Kuron
and Adam Michnik delayed the start of the talks, which the
authorities first proposed during a strikes in August.
   Walesa ended the strikes, Poland's worst labor unrest in seven
years, after the government promised the talks and said they would
include discussion of Solidarity's future.
   Kiszczak's letter came two days after the government announced it
would close the Lenin Shipyard, where Solidarity was formed, for
financial reasons.
   The decision, made by Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski,
appears to have soured Solidarity's attitude toward the government.
But Walesa, an electrician at the Gdansk shipyard, said Solidariy
was still eager for the talks.
   ``There is no climate for the round table, but we want it very
much. We are ready at any moment,'' he said.
   Walesa said Solidarity was a catalyst for reform and it favored
reforming the economy, but he said, ``What happened to the shipyard
is unclear and illogical and it is simply a political mistake.''
   The Solidarity leader is on unpaid leave from the shipyard
dealing with union business. He said if the yard closes, he will
work in a shipyard somewhere else, because his years in the yard
were ``the most beautiful of my life.''

<HEAD>Movie He-Man Puts Muscle Behind GOP Ticket</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When George Bush decided to put some real muscle
behind his campaign, he got a boost from one of the world's most
well-known he-men, Arnold Schwarzenegger.
   Schwarzenegger traveled on the campaign trail with Bush on
Thursday, giving a 1988 twist to the 1984 campaign and advertising
question, ``Where's the beef?''
   The world-class bodybuilder and star of action movies revved up
rally audiences with his introduction of Bush as ``a real live
American hero.''
   Noting his bad-guy role in the futuristic movie, ``The
Terminator,'' Schwarzenegger told a boistrous high school audience
here and a Columbus, Ohio, rally earlier in the day: ``I only play
The Terminator in my movies. But when it comes to America's future,
Michael Dukakis will be the real terminator.`
   He also noted his political differences with his wife, television
news personality Maria Shriver, who as a niece of Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., and the late President John Kennedy is a member of
the family that epitomizes the liberal Democratic tradition.
   ``It is true that I have different political views from my
wife,'' Schwarzenegger said. But he said that was not a problem.
   ``Everything is just fine, especially since I got used to
sleeping in the garage,'' he quipped.
   Schwarzenegger, an Austrian immigrant, has long supported
Republicans and conservatives. He said when he became a U.S.
citizen, he chose the GOP because ``the choice was clear.''
   A beaming Bush happily raised arms with Schwarzenegger at the end
of the rallies, and said the bodybuilder embodies the immigrant
spirit.

<HEAD>25-Year-Old Cadet Dies Six Weeks After Collapsing at Police Academy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TRUDY TYNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A police academy cadet has died six
weeks after he and two dozen other trainees fell ill from rigorous
exercises, and his family's lawyer urged Thursday that the
instructors be charged with manslaughter.
   Timothy Shepard, 25, died late Wednesday at a Pittsburgh hospital
where he had undergone a liver transplant operation. He was in a
coma for two weeks, then emerged, only to lose consciousness again
Monday.
   Doctors removed a blood clot from his brain but could not stem
the hemorrhaging.
   An autopsy was scheduled and a formal state inquest into the
death is planned, state Attorney General James Shannon said
Thursday. Flags were lowered to half-staff in Pittsfield.
   The family's attorney, Michael D. Hashim, described the Shepards
as devastated. ``He came so close to making it,'' Hashim said.
   Just four days before Shepard died, he had written his pregnant
wife of five months, Holly: ``I'm going to make it.''
   Hashim said the state troopers who oversaw the cadets' training
at the Agawam academy should be indicted.
   ``I believe we have a clear-cut case of involuntary manslaughter
here,'' Hashim said. ``They ignored conditions that placed the
cadets in harm.''
   Cadets' reports of hours of exercise on only a few cups of water
sparked at least four state reviews. Shannon announced last week at
the end of his investigation that the Agawam academy was ``a massive
failure.''
   The investigations have begun a shakeup of the agency that runs
the state's regional police academies and supervises training for
other law enforcement groups.
   The director of the state Criminal Justice Training Council
resigned Wednesday and his replacement immediately abolished
so-called stress training, a grueling program of intentionally
confusing orders, verbal abuse and demanding exercise that was
blamed in part for the cadets' dehydration and exhaustion.
   Sixteen cadets were hospitalized during their first week at the
academy, where state troopers trained recruits for police
departments in western Massachusetts. Half the class of 50 suffered
kidney ailments because of the training regimen, according to
Shannon's report.
   On Thursday, he said Hampden District Attorney Michael J. Ryan
had agreed to conduct an inquest into Shepard's death.
   ``The Shepard family and the public are entitled to a full
explanation of Mr. Shepard's death,'' the attorney general said.
   He said he did not believe he had evidence to bring criminal
charges, but hinted that the inquest could lead to an indictment.
``There are potentially different legal consequences when death
occurs,'' he said.
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis said in a statement: ``Nothing can make
up for the Shepard family's loss, but they should know that the
circumstances of this tragedy are of great concern to me. This
administration is already moving swiftly to do all we can to ensure
that it never happen again.''
   Shepard was pronounced dead at 11:20 p.m. Wednesday at
Presbyterian-University Hospital in Pittsburgh. Word of the death
was not released until Thursday at the family's request.
   Shepard never regained the strength to breathe and speak on his
own after falling unconscious on a running track Sept. 19, but he
communicated with his family in writing.
   Shepard's wife, who maintained a vigil at the hospital with his
parents, recalled last week how he had run laps to prepare for the
academy and borrowed law books from friends.
   ``He wanted to be tops at the academy,'' she said. ``He wanted to
graduate No. 1 in his class.''
   Friends and co-workers raised $10,000 for the young man voted
Youth of the Year by the Pittsfield Boys' Club in 1981. His medical
bills exceeded $330,000, according to Mayor Anne Wojtkowski.
   ``He was a kid with intestinal fortitude who wasn't a quitter,''
said James Mooney, executive director of the Boys' Club. ``He stood
right up against the training and it killed him. He even showed his
fortitude by clinging to life as long as he did. He never gave up.
We've got to straighten out that system so young fellows don't have
to go through that.''

   James Michener will use Canadian royalties from
``Journey,'' his first novel about Canada, to establish a fund for
promoting the nation's fiction writers and their work, his publisher
said Thursday.
   Judy Brunsek of McClelland and Stewart said ``Journey,'' just
arriving in bookstores, should earn $164,000 in royalties the first
year.
   A $8,200 prize will be awarded annually to a piece of Canadian
short fiction selected from about 25 to 30 small literary journals
across the country. It and others chosen by a literary jury will be
published as a volume each year, with the first scheduled for 1989.
   In an interview with the Toronto Star, Michener was quoted as
saying he felt it improper to ``barge in here and publish a book and
take royalties out of the country.''
   ``Journey'' is set in the Klondike in 1897-99, during the gold
rush, and tells of four Englishmen and an Irishman who travel to the
Canadian Northwest.
   Ms. Brunsek said the 220-page book began as part of ``Alaska,''
one of Michener's sprawling bestsellers, but was cut to bring the
length down to 868 pages.
   ``He gets attached to his characters and decided he had read
enough to perhaps expand it,'' she said in a telephone interview.
``Because it was set in Canada, he felt very strongly about getting
published in Canada.''
   ``He called us one day,'' she said, laughing. ``We couldn't quite
believe it. ... We of course jumped at the chance.''
   Plans are for ``Journey'' to be published in the United States
next year by Random House, the author's American publisher. U.S.
royalties will not be affected by the Canadian arrangement.
   The 81-year-old author agreed to the plans for a short-fiction
prize during a promotional visit to Toronto earlier this week. He
and Pierre Berton, whose popular histories of northern Canada
figured in the research for ``Alaska,'' made a joint appearance
Monday night.
   Michener was quoted by the Star as saying he was ``caught up'' by
the story of the five men in the portion cut from ``Alaska'' and
``became intensely interested in what would have happened to them.''
   He said his next long novel will be about the Caribbean and
probably will be published in 1990.

<HEAD>Mozambique Rebels Ambush Train From South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rightist rebels ambushed a passenger
train en route from South Africa to Maputo, killing eight people and
injuring 38, Mozambique's national news agency AIM reported Thursday.
   State radio blamed Wednesday's attack on ``forces within South
Africa'' trying to wreck an ongoing peace initiative between
Marxist-ruled Mozambique and South Africa.
   In South Africa, Foreign Minister Pik Botha condemned the bombing
and reiterated that his government no longer supports the guerrilla
Mozambican National Resistance.
   In a statement, Botha said South Africa is opposed to violence as
a means of settling the Mozambique conflict.
   AIM said the train hit a land mine 30 miles northwest of Maputo
then was fired on by rebels, who have waged a hit-and-run insurgency
since 1977.
   President Joaquim Chissano's government contended South Africa
violated a 1984 non-aggression pact and continued to aid the
guerrillas. But relations between the neighbors have improved.
Chissano and South African President P.W. Botha held a summit
meeting in September and Pik Botha last month opened new offices for
Pretoria's trade mission in Maputo.
   A Radio Mozambique commentary said unspecified elements in South
Africa were helping the rebels in attempts to destroy the peace
initiative.
   ``The forces that command banditry, at whatever level they are to
be found within South African society, are telling us through the
explosions of these mines, the rattle of these machine guns, that
they do not want peace and cooperation between Mozambique and South
Africa,'' the radio said. ``They want war, death and destruction.''
   Mozambican sources in the past have suggested a possible split
within the South African government regarding Mozambique, with
relatively moderate Foreign Affairs officials favoring rapprochement
and some military officers wanting covert aid for the rebels to keep
Mozambique weak.

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A conservative politician on
Thursday urged the government to deny political asylum to refugees
from Eastern Europe and deport them.
   The suggestion by Bavarian Interior Minister Edmund Stoiber drew
immediate rebukes from other politicians and added fire to a
nationwide debate on whether liberal asylum rules should be
restricted.
   Stoiber said asylum seekers from countries like Poland and
Hungary ``generally were not politically persecuted'' and only came
to West Germany in search of jobs.
   He said asylum laws should be changed so that ``economic''
refugees from Eastern Europe can be sent back at West German borders.
   A record influx of people seeking asylum has stretched West
Germany's social services. On Thursday, Frankfurt Airport opened a
$1.4 million building to house 200 asylum seekers.
   Although West Germany rarely officially grants asylum to Soviet
bloc refugees, they are in most cases allowed to remain in the
country and usually given internationally accepted travel documents.
   ``We must reconsider this policy toward the East in light of
political changes there,'' Stoiber said, referring to Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev's drive for reforms.
   He also noted Sweden recently announced it will stop giving
asylum to Soviet citizens.
   Anke Fuchs, a leading member of the opposition Social Democrats,
called Stoiber's statement ``irresponsible.''
   ``There is no place for appeals to lower insticts of many
people,'' said Ulrich Irmer, a lawmaker of the government coalition
Free Democratic party.
   The political debate began when a senior Social Democratic
official suggested in October that ethnic Germans arriving from the
Soviet Union and other East European countries should be treated in
the same way as other asylum seekers.
   Oskar Lafontaine, a leftist deputy chairman of the Social
Democrats, was criticized even by party colleagues.
   The West German government has been urging Soviet bloc countries
to allow more ethnic Germans to leave for many years. The ethnic
Germans automatically receive German citizenship when they arrive.
   Third World immigrants seeking asylum, however, often face a long
and uncertain battle to get residence and work permits.
   More than 132,400 ethnic Germans arrived in the first nine months
of this year from the Soviet Union, Poland and Romania. The number
of newly arrived ethnic Germans was 51,900 at the same time last
year.
   Federal officials say they recevied 68,285 asylum applications
from Jan. 1 to Sept. 30, more than double the number of 36,869
during the same period last year.

   An employee of the Agency for
International Development pleaded guilty Thursday to charges he used
his diplomatic passport to illegally transport jewelry from Hong
Kong to India.
   David Devin, 44, a project development officer for Asia and the
Near East, pleaded guilty to a charge of misuing his diplomatic
passport following negotiations between his attorney and prosecutors.
   Officials said Devin purchased gold in Hong Kong and took it to
India, where gold imports are prohibited except for certain licensed
dealers and refiners. They said the proceeds were transferred out of
India to the United States, where Devin purchased real estate in
Seattle, Wash.
   U.S. Customs officials confiscated about $29,800 in cash and
$3,424 in wholesale jewelry, which Devin agreed to forfeit.
   U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton released Devin was released on
personal recognizance bond pending sentencing next Feb. 10. He could
receive between six months and one year in prison.
   Devin, of Annandale, Va., has been placed on administrative leave
from his $63,434-a-year job, AID officials said. However, Mary
O'Mara, an AID investigator, said action to formally dismiss Devin
should soon be completed.
   AID officials said Devin traveled to Hong Kong twice and
purchased gold worth about $112,000. Jewelers in Hong Kong partially
financed the gold purchases. Devin then left for India, using his
diplomatic passport, and delivered gold to the Indian jewelers.
   Officials said Devin persuaded a fellow employee who was assigned
to the AID in India to pick up about $40,000 of the money and
deliver it to Devin in Washington.
   The AID employee who allegedly assisted Devin is under
investigation, but has not been charged, authorities said.
   They said officials were alerted to Devin's smuggling scheme when
he asked another employee to take a package from India to the United
States. The employee became suspicious about what the package
contained, opened it and discovered a large amount of cash.

<HEAD>Jewish Leader Appeals for Calm Amid Dispute over Crystal Night</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of West German Jews said Thursday a
dispute over whether he should address parliament on the 50th
anniversary of a Nazi pogrom should not cloud the memorials to its
victims.
   ``In no way should the somber weight of (Crystal Night) be
overshadowed by partisan bickering and personal self-interest,''
said Heinz Galinski, head of the German Jewish Council.
   Galinski made the remarks after a leader of Frankfurt's Jewish
community accused him of trying every means to address parliament.
   The Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, declined to invite
Galinski to address a special Nov. 10 session marking the
anniversary of Kristallnacht, when Nazi thugs ransacked Jewish
property and synagogues.
   The pogrom got its name meaning ``Crystal Night'' because of the
shards of glass that littered the streets after the rampage.
   Opposition Greens legislators had called for the Bundestag to
invite Galinski, but the motion was rejected on procedural grounds.
   Galinski said Thursday he was ``drawn into the embarrassing
discussion.''
   The main Kristallnacht anniversary ceremony in West Germany will
be in Frankfurt on Nov. 9 and will be attended by President Richard
von Weizsaecker and Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Extensive ceremonies are planned throughout the country to mark
the pogrom in which dozens of people were killed during the night of
Nov. 9-10, 1938. More than 250 synagogues and 7,500 businesses were
destroyed.

   Intelligence police said Thursday they are
interrogating 25 politicians arrested during an illegal meeting.
   An officer who spoke on condition of anonymity said the men had
held other meetings, apparently to plot strategy for next year when
a ban on political activities will be lifted.
   The officer said detectives arrested the men Tuesday at a Lagos
club and probably will charge them.
   He did not name the politicians but said they included two former
national officers of Unity Party of Nigeria and members of the
Nigeria People's Party and National Party of Nigeria.
   Under former President Shehu Shagari, the National Party formed
the country's last civilian government. Shagari was ousted in a 1983
coup and the country's 50-plus political parties were outlawed.
   Babangida, who seized power from another military ruler three
years ago, has promised to allow political activity from mid-1989 in
preparation for a return to civilian rule in 1992.
   But he has said only two parties will be allowed when the
military relinquishes power.
   This oil-rich West African nation, the continent's most populous,
has suffered seven military coups since its 1960 independence from
Britain.

   A nationwide strike called Thursday by
Sinhalese militants to mourn the deaths of three university students
closed stores and stranded thousands of commuters.
   Heavily armed troops escorted a few government-operated buses
packed with commuters.
   The government imposed a six-hour curfew beginning at 11 p.m.
Wednesday to counter the strike call, which it said was part of a
plot to disrupt general elections.
   In a statement, the government warned ``subversive elements''
would try to disrupt normal life Thursday as a ``forerunner to a
planned attempt to disrupt the presidential and parliamentary
elections and deny people the right to vote.''
   Presidential elections are scheduled for Dec. 19, and
parliamentary elections are due by August 1989.
   The militant Sinhalese People's Liberation Front called
Thursday's strike through posters on walls urging people to protest
about three university students allegedly tortured to death by the
son of a government legislator.
   One of the biggest state newspaper chains, Associated Newspapers
of Ceylon, ignored Front demands it stop publication.
   The communist newspaper Aththa bowed to the threat and did not
publish.
   The Front is the vanguard of a Sinhalese backlash against a July
1987 peace accord to end the five-year Tamil separatist war.
   Since then, the government has blamed the Front for more than 500
assassinations.
   The radicals contend the accord makes too many concessions to
mainly-Hindu minority Tamils, who say they are discriminated against
by the majority Buddhist Sinhalese.

<HEAD>10 Species Face Extinction in China, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten rare species of animals, including the Asian
elephant and the black gibbon, will disappear from China in 40 years
if the population keeps growing at its current rate, the World
Wildlife Foundation says.
   The foundation's report said that because China must concentrate
on providing food, clothes and shelter for its growing population,
it lacks the funds to protect endangered species.
   The report, quoted by the overseas edition of the official
People's Daily, said other animals facing extinction are the argali,
a wild sheep; Huanan tiger; Northeast tiger; Bactrian camel; crest
ibis; black neck crane; Chinese alligator and globefish.
   Some of the animals exist outside China.
   China is the world's most populous nation. It has 1.08 billion
people, and the population is expected to be at least 1.25 billion
by the end of this century.
   The Wildlife Foundation report noted that many endangered species
live in isolated areas inhabited mainly by minority nationalities,
who are exempt from the nation's strict family planning policies and
are using more and more natural resources.
   Some rare animals, including the giant panda and the golden
monkey, are caught and killed, it said.
   Chinese experts say there are now fewer than 1,000 pandas living
in the wild in several areas of southwest China. The Wildlife
Foundation has spent $4 million over the past eight years to help
the Chinese protect pandas.
   The report said wild animals have almost been wiped out in
isolated areas of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau of western China as a
result of increases in population and livestock.

<HEAD>D.C. Sues To Stop Congressional Order on Gay Rights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The District of Columbia Council filed a
lawsuit against the federal government Thursday, claiming that a
congressional order changing a city statute on gay rights is
unconstitutional.
   Sen. William Armstrong, R-Colo., attached an amendment to the
city's spending bill for the current fiscal year directing the city
to allow religiously affiliated educational institutions to deny
certain rights to gay student organizations. Should the city fail to
comply with this order, all federal and local funds would be frozen
after Dec. 31.
   ``We have been placed upon the horns of a dilemma by the
Armstrong amendment,'' the 13 members of the council said in a
statement. Noting that each member has sworn to uphold the
Constitution, ``we feel that we would violate this oath if we were
to adopt the language directed by the Armstrong amendment.''
   The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court only after city
officials were unable to persuade Armstrong to withdraw the measure,
council chairman David Clarke said.
   The suit seeks a preliminary injunction against the cutoff of
district funds while the matter remains in litigation. Under federal
law, the city's budget must be approved by Congress.
   The suit claims the amendment violates First Amendment
prohibitions against governmental establishment of religion and
abridges First Amendment protection of free speech and association
by authorizing discrimination against gay student groups.
   The suit also charges that the amendment violates the council
members' right to free speech by requiring them to vote to enact the
amendment.
   ``Never before has Congress been so coercive in dealing with a
state or local government,'' said attorney Michael Greenberger, who
helped prepare the lawsuit. ``Here they're saying, in effect, `If
you don't do this one little thing, your government is down the
drain.'''
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who chairs the Senate appropriations
panel that reviews the city's budget, has advocated legal action
against the federal government.
   ``I would encourage the district government to seek legal redress
(from enforcing the Armstrong amendment),'' Harkin stated in a
letter to Clarke dated Oct. 7. ``In my opinion ... this provision
raises legitimate constitutional questions about the rights of
District of Columbia Council.''
   The district's non-voting House delegate, Walter Fauntroy, said
the lawsuit was the only action available to the city.
   The suit ``is the legitimate exercise of the right of any local
government within the United States to seek redress through the
judicial branch when a significant legal question is at stake,''
Fauntroy said in a prepared statement.
   Mayor Marion Barry Jr. was out of the country and not immediately
available for comment.
   The city's human rights office had found Georgetown University
discriminated against gay groups by not providing them rooms and
meeting space. The Roman Catholic school agreed earlier this year to
provide the groups meeting space and access to student funds only
after two courts had upheld the city's finding.
   The university has stated it will abide by the agreement with the
city, despite the congressional action.

<HEAD>U.N. Assembly Urges Vietnamese Withdrawal from Cambodia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

   The General Assembly voted overwhelmingly
Thursday to approve a resolution calling for Vietnam to withdraw its
troops from Cambodia, the 10th straight year it has done so.
   U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters told the Assembly that
``Vietnam's illegal occupation of Cambodia remains the root cause of
the conflict in Cambodia today.''
   Walters said an ``essential element of any political settlement
is the removal of Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot'' and his lieutenants
who presided over the deaths of 2 million Cambodians from 1975 to
1978.
   Applause rippled through the hall after the 122-19 vote was
announced. There were three abstentions.
   Vietnamese Ambassador Trinh Xuan Lang said the resolution
continues ``to distort the realities in Kampuchea,'' the Cambodian
capital, and does not stress strongly enough that the Khmer Rouge
must be barred from power.
   China'a ambassador, Li Luye, said the ``Vietnamese authorities
continue to prolong their gross violation of the sovereignty of
Kampuchea and violation of the rights of its people.''
   China is the main supplier of the Cambodian resistance coalition,
which also receives U.S. aid. The Soviet Union backs Vietnam and the
government it has installed in Cambodia.
   Walters called for internationally supervised, free elections by
the Cambodian people.
   He also called for an international monitoring and peacekeeping
force to oversee Vietnam's troop withdrawal and the disarming of all
Cambodian factions, particularly the Khmer Rouge.
   The U.S. envoy said that for the first time in nearly 10 years of
Vietnamese occupation, ``there is reason for cautious optimism
regarding Cambodia's future.''
   He cited Vietnam's announcement in May that it would withdraw
50,000 of its 130,000 troops from Cambodia by the end of the year; a
meeting in Jakarta, Indonesia, among Cambodian factions, the
Vietnamese and Southeast Asian nations; and talks between Chinese
and Soviet vice foreign ministers in Beijing in late August.
   But Walters said that there have been few concrete signs of a
major movement of Vietnamese forces out of Cambodia.
   The resolution sponsored by the Association of South-East Asian
Nations calls for international supervision to make sure there is no
return to the ``universally condemned policies of a recent past.''
   Cambodia's seat in the 159-member General Assembly is shared by
an anti-Vietnam resistance coalition that includes the Khmer Rouge,
now led by Khieu Samphan.
   The other members of the resistance coalition are non-Communist
forces led by former Cambodian head of state Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, and followers of former Prime Minister Son Sann's Khmer
People's National Liberation Front.
   Son Sann said Wednesday the Cambodian government should dissolve
and merge with the three resistance partners in a transitional
government.
   He said the Vietnamese have been using ``genocidal'' tactics such
as moving peasants from their villages and using them to clear
minefields near the border. He said 70 percent of them contracted
malaria.

   Much of the Soviet Union's state archives, the
repository for memories long denied to the Soviet people, remain
closed to scholars even during this era of glasnost, says the man
who trains the nation's historians.
   ``The process of democratization and accessibility of the
archives is going very slowly, much more slowly than any of us
want,'' said Yuri N. Afanasyev, director of Moscow's State
Historical Archives Institute since 1986 and a confidant of
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Afanasyev, whose institute has 270 professors and 4,500 students,
also said in an interview that key documents, including the
Stalin-Hitler pact that helped spark World War II, have disappeared
from the national archives.
   ``I don't know for a fact that the Stalin archives haven't been
destroyed. I do know that some very important documents have
disappeared,'' he said.
   ``For instance, the (Hitler-Stalin) pact and the secret protocols
that go with it have vanished. They're simply not in the Soviet
archives,'' Afanasyev said. He was referring to the 1939
non-aggression accord that freed Nazi Germany to invade Poland and
led to the Soviet seizure of Polish territory and the takeover of
the Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
   The Soviet Union has traditionally denied the existence of the
pact's protocols because they would raise embarrassing questions
about the historical basis for Eastern European boundaries. The
Soviets, however, have recently suggested the original protocols and
maps, copies of which were discovered in Nazi archives and published
in the West, might have been lost.
   For many Soviets, the first opportunity to learn the details of
the pact came in an article in Sovietskaya Rossiya, one of the
Soviet Union's largest newspapers, in August, following widespread
independence demonstrations in the Baltic republics.
   The 54-year-old Afanasyev, a vocal advocate of glasnost or
selective openness, was asked about other state papers covering
Stalin's conduct of the war, the Great Terror of the 1930s, the
collectivization of agriculture, and the famine and purges that
killed millions.
   ``There is no basis for assuming that the archives are untouched
and undamaged. After all, a regime that murdered millions of people
certainly wouldn't hesitate to destroy a piece of paper,'' said
Afanasyev, a member of the Communist Party since 1961.
   Afanasyev did not say when he believed the documents had
disappeared. Asked about the possibility of archives being shredded
nowadays, he said it would be ``very difficult,'' and that he knew
of ``nothing to sound an alarm about.''
   ``I am the victim along with all other historians. I stand with
those who suffer from the hardship of lack of access,'' said
Afanasyev, who has kept a high profile by writing unprecedented
critical items in the mainstream Soviet press.
   In a much-discussed letter to the editor in Pravda this summer,
he questioned some of the fundamental notions in the current system
of Soviet socialism. He also has pushed for the rehabilitation of
Soviet ``non-persons'' such as Leon Trotsky.
   Afanasyev also is a proponent of perestroika, the restructuring
of Soviet society, which has included efforts to discredit the
Stalinist regime and many aspects of its brutally imposed command
economy.
   ``The trouble is that in archives, as in many other things in the
Soviet Union, the dominant theme seems to be uncertainty and
vagueness,'' said Afanasyev.
   ``You can't talk about perestroika until we know what we want to
restructure. We have to have an exhaustive, complete picture of what
the reality is,'' said Afanasyev.
   ``For the moment, archives are mostly inaccessible _ I mean, the
interesting parts,'' Afanasyev. Some of those interesting parts, he
added, are accessible only in the United States.
   The interview with Afansyev, who also is a specialist in French
history, was conducted partly in Russian with the help of an
American translator and partly in French.
   Afanasyev traveled to about a dozen U.S. universities last month
to discuss expanding their exchange programs with his institute.

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl and visiting
President Francois Mitterrand of France agreed Thursday their
countries should work more closely in developing policies toward the
Kremlin, Kohl's spokesman said.
   ``The two underlined the enormous importance of stronger
cooperation in this area for the development of relations with
countries of the Warsaw Pact,'' Kohl spokesman Friedhelm Ost told
reporters.
   In an 80-minute meeting with Mitterrand, Kohl described his
recent summit in Moscow with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, Ost
said. Mitterrand is scheduled to visit Moscow later this month.
   Kohl also said West Germany supported France's efforts to reduce
its trade deficit, Ost said. The spokesman said West German advisers
will help with these efforts, but he did not elaborate.
   The West German chancellor also spoke with French Premier Michel
Rocard, according to Ost.
   Kohl and Rocard, discussed obstacles that remain to the European
Economic Community's plans for removing trade barriers within its
borders by 1992, as well as environmental protection and cooperation
in high-technology areas, Ost said.
   Mitterrand and Rocard, accompanied by other French officials,
arrived at Bonn-Cologne airport Thursday to begin two days of talks
with West German leaders.
   Mitterrand also met with President Richard von Weizsaecker.
   On Thursday night, Mitterrand attended a dinner in Bonn held in
his honor at the Schaumburg Palace.

   The Jewish settlers movement said Thursday it
plans to set up 50 more communities in the occupied territories and
urged the political parties likely to form Israel's new government
to endorse their proposal.
   Spokesmen for the Gush Emunim settlers' movement, or Bloc of the
Faithful, also said the group was ready to set up four new
communities within days in the occupied Gaza Strip.
   The government must approve all new settlements in the
Palestinian-dominated West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel has
occupied since the 1967 Middle East war.
   More than 130 settlements have been established so far, but only
11 have been set up in the four years that Israel has been governed
by a coalition of the right-wing Likud bloc and the left-leaning
Labor Party.
   Palestinans launched an uprising in the occupied lands Dec. 8
against Israeli rule and have vigorously opposed Jewish settlements
in their territories. More than 300 Palestinians and 10 Israelis
have died in the uprising.
   Likud won 39 seats to Labor's 38 in parliament elections Tuesday,
and is expected to form a new coalition government with smaller
right-wing and religious parties that support more settlements.
   Gush Emunim representatives met Wednesday with right-wing and
religious political parties likely to join Likud in the new
government.
   ``We explained to them nicely that in the comming days we're
going to create settlements'' in the Gaza Strip, Menahem Beit
Halahmi told army radio Thursday. He is spokesman for several
existing settlements in Gaza.
   The settlers also said they were ready to establish seven new
communities in the West Bank, said a Gush Emunim representative who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The 11 settlements are part of the group's three-year plan to
build 50 new communities in occupied lands, he said.
   The plan was unveiled in meetings with leaders of the Moledet,
Tehiya and Tzomet nationalist parties and the National Religious
Party, the representative said.
   A settlers' group statement said the talks resulted in agreement
that the settlement issue would be brought up by the smaller parties
with Likud.
   Yitzhak Rath, a spokesman for the National Religious Party, said
the issue would be brought up in meetings with Likud.
   In Gaza, 2,500 Jewish settlers live in 19 settlements, and about
70,000 Jewish settlers live in 114 West Bank settlements. About 1.5
million Palestinians live in the occupied lands.

   Doctors will give free heroin to a
group of drug addicts in an experiment to prevent the spread of
AIDS, the National Health and Medical Research Council said Thursday.
   The council has approved the trial provision of prescription
heroin in single-use syringes for a number of ``carefully selected''
intravenous drug users, said Tony Basten, chairman of the council's
liaison committee on acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   The experiment will begin next year.
   Basten said Australia had two years at the most to stop AIDS
spreading from intravenous drug users and their sexual partners to
the community at large.
   The study's results are expected to help decide whether Australia
should move toward fighting AIDS by permitting legal prescription of
limited amounts of drugs.
   ``If we get it wrong then we are going to be like New York City
where 85 percent of intravenous drug users are infected,'' Basten
said.
   He estimated 1 percent to 3 percent of intravenous drug users in
centers like Sydney were infected with AIDS. He said recreational
users posed the greatest threat as, unlike addicts, they were
difficult to reach with educational messages.
   The details of the study had not been decided but would be
finalized as a matter of urgency, he said.
   Australia has reported more than 1,000 AIDS victims, half of whom
have died.

<HEAD>US Accuses Soviets Of Firing Scud Missiles At Afghan Rebels</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviets have fired SS-1 Scud missiles on
Afghan rebels in an escalation of the war in Afghanistan, the State
Department said Thursday.
   The attack, involving six to eight missiles, was carried out in
the Nangaraq region near the border with Pakistan, spokesman Charles
E. Redman said. He gave no estimate of the damage or of casualties.
   Repeating an earlier warning, Redman said: ``If the introduction
of this weaponry is an attempt to intimidate Pakistan, then Moscow
should know that Pakistan enjoys our full support. The use of this
weapon represents a further escalation in the level of violence.''
   The spokesman said U.S. diplomats in Moscow had registered their
concern at the Soviet foreign ministry and Deputy Secretary of State
John C. Whitehead complained Wednesday to Soviet Ambassador Yuri V.
Dubinin.
   The arrival of new Soviet missiles in Kabul had raised U.S.
concern about Pakistan's security and whether there would be a delay
in the second stage of the Red Army's withdrawal from Afghanistan.
   The SS-1 Scud rockets were displayed in the Afghan capital after
Undersecretary of State Michael H. Armacost complained to Dubinin on
Monday about sending long-range TU-26 Backfire bombers into combat
there for the first time.
   The Soviets are backing the Afghan government against U.S.-armed
rebels in a war that has raged for nearly nine years. On Aug. 15,
the Soviets completed the pullout of more than half the 100,000
troops that had fought alongside the pro-Moscow government.
   The remaining troops must depart by Feb. 15 under an agreement
signed in Geneva last spring. The Soviets hinted recently that the
second stage would begin Nov. 15, but a U.S. official said earlier
this week that it might be delayed.
   The official, who demanded anonymity, also said the United States
would ensure that the rebels had an ``adequate'' arsenal, although
missiles to match the Scuds probably would not be provided through
Pakistan.
   Two Scud-B missiles, which have a range of about 175 miles, were
displayed in Kabul on Tuesday. It was not clear how many of the
mobile weapon the Soviets had shipped to Afghanistan.
   U.S. weapons to the guerrillas are delivered through Pakistan,
which also has given sanctuary to millions of Afghan refugees.
   The Afghan news agency, in a dispatch Tuesday, accused Pakistan
of instigating attacks by ``extremist'' guerrillas on population
centers and demilitarized areas. ``This is why a new kind of weapon,
mainly long-range missiles with a great destructive power, was
adopted for service by the Afghan army,'' the Afghan general staff
said.
   ``The missiles will be used to stop the criminal activities of
the extremist group,'' the dispatch added, without referring
specifically to the Scud-B.
   Gennady Gerasimov, the spokesman for the Soviet foreign ministry,
said at a news conference last month in New York that Pakistan's
support for the rebels could have ``unpredictable'' consequences.
   ``We don't want to be specific,'' he said. But he left open the
possibility that the withdrawal of Soviet troops might be suspended.
   Redman said Thursday that ``the use of new aircraft and Scud
missiles is not consistent with Soviet assurances that they would
not undertake offensive operations during the withdrawal period
except in defense of their own forces.''
   He said the introduction of new weapons into the war does not
contribute to the political solution the Soviets had promised to
pursue. He said the missiles were fired from Kabul on Tuesday and
Wednesday.

   George Bush rejected allegations of
racial overtones in his campaign as ``grossly unfair and untrue''
Thursday while looking beyond the election to appeal for a closing
of political wounds.
   Bush also suggested he could balance the federal budget by 1992
while resisting tax raises and increasing federal spending by $100
billion over five years.
   In an interview on NBC's ``Today'' program and in campaign
appearances, Bush spoke of a need for national unity after the
election.
   ``I think the country will come together immediately behind
whoever wins this election,'' he told NBC in a 25-minute interview
from Columbus, Ohio.
   ``I would work my level best if I'm elected to heal any wounds
that might be there.''
   And he later told a downtown crowd of several thousand in
Columbus, ``This country will be together once this election is
over.''
   But that didn't stop Bush from continuing a stinging assault on
Democrat Michael Dukakis as he campaigned through delegate-rich
industrial states in the Midwest in the closing days of the race.
   ``The liberals look at your paychecks the way Colonel Sanders
looks at chicken,'' Bush said, referring to the fast-foot chicken
franchise chain.
   He told a jammed rally in a wooden-roofed high school field house
in this southwest Chicago suburb that Dukakis was ``outside the
mainstream.''
   The rally was attended by about 3,000 persons, most of them
students. Because of poor acoustics, many of Bush's words were
difficult to hear.
   In the ``Today'' interview, Bush rejected Democatic suggestions
of racism in his campaign's repeated mention of Willie Horton, a
black murder convict who attacked a white Maryland couple after
failing to return from a weekend furlough from a Massachusetts
prison.
   ``I don't have an ounce of bigotry in my body nor does my running
mate,'' Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, Bush said.
   ``To go out and try to accuse me of something that is not in my
heart, this charge of racism, is grossly unfair and untrue. And
everybody that knows me knows it's untrue,'' Bush said.
   He called attacks on Quayle ``a lot of smoke and frenzying of
bluefish out there going after a drop of blood in the water.''
   Bush also defended Quayle indirectly at the rally in Columbus,
saying, ``No one on the Republican side is running away from any
other candidate. We are one ticket, representing the mainstream.''
   Traveling with Bush on Thursday's campaign stops was actor-body
builder Arnold Schwarzeneger, who told audiences: ``My movies are
just fiction. I only played the `Terminator' in the movies. But when
it comes to the American future, Michael Dukakis would be the real
terminator.''
   The race in Illinois, with 24 electoral votes, is considered a
tossup, while polls show Bush ahead in Ohio.
   The vice president was also to attend a rally later Thursday in
Hackensack, N.J. He planned campaign stops on Friday in Connecticut
and Ohio.
   In the TV interview, Bush defended anew his proposal for a
``flexible freeze'' as a way of eliminating the nation's federal
budget deficit by 1991-92.
   The proposal calls for holding increases in spending to the level
of inflation.
   Bush's proposal assumes economic growth of about 3 percent a year
and a reduction of interest rates by at least 2 percentage points.
   ``You can grow by $100 billion in spending over the next five
years, and if my economic model is correct, still get the deficit
down,'' Bush said. Many economists have challenged Bush's contention
that the budget could be balanced without some form of tax increase.
   ``I am challenging the conventional wisdom that you need to go
raise taxes,'' Bush said. He said he would reject a tax increase
even if one was proposed by a blue-ribbon bipartisan commission now
studying the deficit.

   Experts from Iran and Iraq met for the first time
Thursday to discuss technical details of the U.N.-mediated Gulf
peace talks, a development U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar called ``a good sign.''
   The meeting included experts from the two countries and the
United Nations, said U.N. spokeswoman Therese Gastaut. She refused
to say what type experts.
   Absent were Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, his
Iraqi counterpart Tariq Aziz, and Perez de Cuellar, who has been
mediating.
   Jan Eliasson, the U.N. special representative to the talks,
refused to disclose details of the 2{-hour meeting.
   ``We have today entered into detail into certain important
matters. This is progress, that you enter into detailed
discussions,'' said Eliasson.
   A member of the Iranian team, Sirous Nasseri, who is Iran's
ambassador to Geneva, said the two sides discussed withdrawal to
internationally recognized boundaries and the question of freedom of
navigation.
   Eliasson said the talks would continue Friday with Perez de
Cuellar meeting separately with Velayati and Aziz.
   Asked if this represented a departure from Perez de Cuellar's
announcement Tuesday that future meetings would be face-to-face,
Eliasson replied: ``I think it should be seen as an advantage that
one has both possibilities, both separate meetings and plenaries,
and we certainly envisage the possibility of continued plenary
meetings.''
   ``There is simply a need to discuss matters directly with the
ministers'' sometimes, he said, but he refused to elaborate.
   The talks are aimed at implementing a U.N. Security Council
resolution calling for a cease-fire in the 8-year-old war. A fragile
truce has been in effect since Aug. 20.
   Reporters asked Perez de Cuellar whether it was a bad sign that
the experts were meeting without the ministers. ``No, it's a good
sign,'' he said.
   Also Thursday, Iran charged Iraq was using humanitarian issues to
delay withdrawing from Iranian territory.
   Velayati, speaking after a meeting with officials of the
International Committee of the Red Cross, was answering an Iraqi
charge that Iran was delaying the repatriation of prisoners of war
on both sides, estimated by the United Nations to number at least
100,000.
   Velayati reiterated that POW repatriation must come under the
terms of the U.N. cease-fire arrangement.
   He renewed Iran's offer to release immediately all sick and
wounded prisoners as well as civilian detainees ``on a reciprocal
basis.''
   Iraq proposed last month that the two sides immediately begin a
POW exchange, independent of the U.N. talks.
   In a separate development, a new U.N. report expresses concern
about reports of ``a renewed wave of executions'' in Iran just
before and immediately after Tehran accepted the cease-fire.
   The report to the General Assembly calls for continued U.N.
scrutiny of Iran's alleged execution of political dissenters and
other reported abuses.

   The U.S. Customs Service fined Eastern Airlines $1
million Thursday for allowing 68 pounds of cocaine to be shipped on
one of its flights but agreed not to seize the plane involved.
   The cocaine was discovered Monday aboard Flight 972 from Colombia
hidden in an unmanifested box of ground coffee in the baggage
compartment, said Customs spokesman Cliff Stallings.
   No arrests have been made.
   Customs levied a fine of $1,000 per ounce of the illegal drug, or
just over $1 million, Stallings said.
   The cocaine shipment was the second found aboard an Eastern
flight from Colombia in as many weeks, but in this case, Eastern can
keep the plane unless it balks at paying the fine, Stallings said.
   ``Customs, at the present time, is not seizing the 727, since
Eastern appears to be making serious efforts to improve its security
measures against drug smuggling,'' Stallings said.
   The improvements include a council to work with Customs on
security, he said.
   Eastern spokesmen did immediately return calls seeking comment.
   Last week Customs seized an Eastern L-1011 and fined the company
$896,000 after 56 pounds of cocaine were found in an unmanifested
mail bag. The plane was released after Eastern posted a bond for the
value of the fine.

   Avtex Fibers Inc. officials met with
defense contractors Thursday as the company shut down its plant
here, threatening the supply of a rayon fiber crucial to NASA's
space shuttle and leaving 1,300 workers without a job.
   John N. Gregg, Avtex chairman, was in Utah to meet with officials
of the Morton Thiokol Inc. Aerospace Group, which manufactures the
shuttle's rocket boosters, as well as other defense contractors,
said Rocky Rabb, a Morton Thiokol spokesman at the company's Ogden,
Utah, headquarters.
   He said the meeting in Salt Lake City ``involves many of the
companies and users. There were about 14 different companies
invited.''
   Raab said he did not believe representatives of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration were at the session.
   Avtex announced the closing of the world's largest rayon factory
on Monday, blaming foreign competition and environmental
regulations. Avtex was the government's sole sanctioned supplier of
rayon.
   The rayon fiber produced by the Front Royal plant goes through
several layers of contractors before it is formed into the engine
nozzles of the shuttle and a variety of tactical missiles. NASA has
said it has enough of the material in the supply line for the next
10 shuttle flights.
   Raab said enough fiber was available through February for Morton
Thiokol's Standard missile. Morton Thiokol is working with Hercules
Inc. on the submarine-launched Trident D5 missile, and enough fiber
is available for production to continue through mid-1989, Raab said.
   Fiber supplies are adequate for Air Force deployment and testing
plans on the Peacekeeper intercontinental ballistic missile, Raab
said.
   Officials in this northern Shenandoah Valley town of 11,000 said
the community would survive the loss of 1,300 jobs at the
manufacturing plant, because its economy has evolved dramatically
from the days when it was a one-company town.
   But workers said the plant closing came as a shock.
   ``About the only thing they told us was to come down and get
unemployment benefits,'' said Billy Fields, 42, whose 16-year career
at Avtex came to an abrupt end this week. ``My last shift was
Tuesday evening. Right now, I'm just going to file for
unemployment.''
   ``I think they should have given us more of a notice,'' said
Fields' wife, Diane, who worked eight years for Avtex, which is
based in Valley Forge, Pa. ``I didn't know anything about it until
my husband came home and told me about it.''
   Town Manager Brackenridge Bentley said he believes Front Royal
will prosper as a combination of a factory town, if several plants
employing 200 to 300 people can be lured in, and as a bedroom
community for the thriving Washington, D.C., metro area about an
hour's drive to the east.
   Front Royal began diversifying seven years ago, when a Du Pont
plant opened, employing 350 people. It is already becoming a bedroom
community, with some 600 to 700 single-family homes under
construction.
   Bentley and other area officials also hope any new industry they
attract will be cleaner than Avtex, which had a history of
environmental and safety problems. The company was hit Wednesday by
a $20 million lawsuit, in which Virginia Attorney General Mary Sue
Terry alleges a host of environmental problems were caused by the
plant.
   Bentley said area employers already are advertising for displaced
Avtex workers, though the new jobs will likely pay lower wages,
involve a longer commute and offer fewer benefits.
   An Avtex spokesman in Washington said production at the plant
ended Thursday, but an undetermined number of employees would stay
on to shut down the plant.

<TEXT>
   The pending Soviet legal reforms should include
clear guarantees of human rights, Andrei Sakharov says in a magazine
article to appear Friday.
   Sakharov, who was released from internal exile just two years ago
for his own support of human rights, writes in the Soviet magazine
New Times the new criminal code should clearly state that ``criminal
prosecutions for beliefs and non-violent actions stemming from them
are intolerable.''
   The official Tass news agency reported on the article in a
dispatch Thursday.
   Soviet officials have been quoted in recent days as saying the
draft legal reform will eliminate at least one of the laws now used
to prosecute political prisoners.
   Sakharov also said the new laws should be ``in keeping with
international norms,'' an apparent reference to the human rights
agreements signed by the Soviet Union that Western countries say it
has ignored. These include the Helsinki agreements and a United
Nations covenant.
   The scientist, who won a Nobel Peace Price for his efforts on
behalf of Soviet human rights, further argues that the law-governed
state promised by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev should mean that
everyone is subordinate to the law, Tass said.
   That is a clear objection to a provision of both current Soviet
law and a draft reform that grants immunity from prosecution to
members of the Soviet parliament.
   A law-governed state means first of all ``the primacy of law. All
hierarchy, all government bodies, all persons, no matter what high
posts they may hold, are equal to all citizens before the law,''
Tass quoted Sakharov as saying.
   The news agency report also says Sakharov touched upon freedom of
assembly, freedom in choosing one's country of residence, and
citizens' rights to monitor state decisions.

   A bus skidded into a deep ravine in
eastern India on Thursday, killing 18 people, a news agency reported.
   It was the second fatal bus crash in as many days in India.
   Several other people were hospitalized in Thursday's crash, the
United News of India said without elaborating.
   The accident occured near Kurseong, about 750 miles east of New
Delhi. The bus was on its way from the town of Darjeeling to
Siliguri. Both towns are in West Bengal state.
   On Wednesday, a bus driver trying to negotiate a curve covered by
a landslide lost control of the vehicle and it plunged into a gorge
north of Jammu, killing all 65 people aboard.
   The bus was bound for Kishtwar and had started its journey in
Jammu, winter capital of Jammu-Kashmir state, about 375 miles north
of New Delhi.

<HEAD>Scientists Search For Cellular Basis Of Learning and Addiction</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists believe they are finally beginning
to unravel the marvel of natural chemistry by which the human brain
stores and recalls its trove of facts and sensations.
   Whether the agony of childhood piano lessons, the warming smell
of Mom's apple pie, or mundane essentials like phone numbers and zip
codes, they all trigger chemical changes in brain cells called
neurons as the mind absorbs new information or stimulation, research
has shown.
   And experiments have also demonstrated differences in blood flow
and chemistry between healthy brains and those affected by disease
or drugs or genetic disorders.
   But precisely how the experiences and knowledge of a lifetime are
stored for instant recall among the billions and billions of brain
cells, and how that process is disrupted by disease or drugs, are
questions only now beginning to yield to research.
   Why do some people learn more quickly than others? Why are some
talented in music, or in math, or in the ability to hit a baseball
thrown at 95 miles an hour, while others are not? What is the
cellular difference between ``smart'' and ``dumb?'' How does drug
addiction affect the brain?
   These are among the hundreds of mysteries that scientists in
laboratories all over the world are struggling to answer, said
Daniel L. Alkon of the laboratory of molecular and cellular
neurobiology at the National Institutes of Medicine.
   ``There is still much about learning and memory and how it works
that we simply don't understand,'' said Alkon. ``There are a lot of
different views (in the field) and we are not always in agreement.''
   Alkon was one a series of experts who spoke at a seminar
sponsored by Science, the journal of the American Association for
the Advancement of Science, in connection with a special issue of
the magazine released on Friday.
   In his laboratory, Alkon has used snails and rabbits to
demonstrate some of the chemical changes in a portion of the brain
called the hippocampus.
   He said the studies shows that certain stimulations can trigger
the discharge of a protein called C-kinase in a specific portion of
neurons, hippocampus cells shaped vaguely like a tree.
   The chemical change was demonstrated, said Alkon, using a Pacific
sea snail called the hermissenda. In a laboratory, a snail was
stimulated by first light and then rotation. At first the snail
reacted, by drawing up, only when his cage was rotated. But
eventually, the snail associated the light with the rotation and
would react to the light alone.
   Other snails received the same stimulation, but in a different
pattern. They did not associate the light with the rotation.
   An analysis of the neurons in the brain of the first snail, said
Alkon, showed that C-kinase was deposited in the branches of the
cell. In snails that were not taught to react to the light, he said,
there was no change in the C-kinase deposition.
   Experiments with rabbits, using lights and puffs of air, produced
a similar finding, Alkon said.
   It is believed, he said, that the C-kinase also causes the
branches of the neuron cell to narrow, perhaps a sign of a stored
memory.
   ``It is clear that C-kinase activation can elicit long-lasting
changes in a cell,'' and may play a role in the creation of a
memory, Alkon said.
   Another speaker, Michael Kuhar, a researcher at the National
Institute on Drug Addiction, said that scientists have discovered
how cocaine affects the brain and why it is the most addictive drug
known.
   Kuhar said that cocaine acts in the limbic section of the brain,
the portion that is associated with emotions and the sense of
pleasure.
   The brain acts to give a feeling of pleasure or well being when a
neurotransmitter protein called dopamine moves across a synapse,
which is a gap between two neurons. The dopamine is released on one
side of the synapse, leaps to the receptor side and delivers an
impulse. The dopamine is then released by the receptor and returns
to its original side of the synapse. This release ends the reaction.
   Kuhar said studies have shown that cocaine attaches itself to the
receptor side of the synapse and blocks the return of dopamine,
causing the reaction, which is a sense of pleasure, to continue
until the cocaine is metabolized.
   The action initially, he said, is a ``great rush'' because the
dopamine causes the impulse in the synapse to keep firing, time
after time.
   ``The pleasure pathways are hyperstimulated,'' Kuhar said.
   But when the cocaine actions halts, there is a shortage of
dopamine and the user experiences a steep letdown and a strong
impulse to use more of the drug to restimulate the pleasure
pathways. Thus, the cellular basis for a cycle of addiction is
reinforced.
   ``Cocaine is the most powerful reinforcer known,'' said Kuhar.
   He said crack cocaine, which is smoked or injected, delivers more
of the drug to the synapse and gives a much quicker and more
intensive ``rush.'' But afterward, there is also a quicker and
steeper letdown and a greater impulse for re-use.

<TEXT>
   A man who spent 10 years in prison for a fatal
supermarket fire was released Thursday when a lawyer, working for
free after he became convinced of the man's innocence, persuaded a
judge to set aside the verdict.
   Eric Jackson, 31, gasped and then smiled when state Supreme Court
Justice Joseph Slavin granted him a new trial on arson and murder
charges in the deaths of six firefighters.
   ``Our prayers have been answered. Justice is for real,'' said his
brother, Phillip Moore.
   Jackson's five children and stepchildren, ages 5 to 16, also were
in the courtroom. His eldest son cried.
   Slavin said he decided to set aside the verdict after reviewing
boxes of documents from the district attorney's office and
discovered a memo that may have helped clear Jackson and which was
not turned over to the defense during his first trial.
   ``He's been in jail for pretty much 10 years. In my opinion, he
has a very good chance of not being convicted at a new trial,'' the
judge said.
   Assistant District Attorney Michael Gore said he would appeal the
ruling.
   Jackson was sentenced to 158 years in prison after being
convicted of arson and six counts of murder in connection with the
fire Aug. 2, 1978, at a Waldbaum's supermarket in Brooklyn.
   Six firefighters fell to their deaths in the burning supermarket
when the roof collapsed.
   Jackson's attorney, Robert Sullivan, had helped represent widows
of the firefighters in civil suits. He said he decided to represent
Jackson without pay after discovering information in the civil cases
that pointed to his innocence.
   ``When I read all the evidence, I found that the district
attorney had held back evidence; two, that the fire was accidental
and not an arson; and three, that Jackson had been railroaded,''
Sullivan said.
   The March 1979 memo cited by Slavin, written by an assistant
district attorney, Michael Gary, to another assistant, said that a
fire marshal told investigators that there were four separate fires
that day at the supermarket and that the fourth fire was the one
that caused the roof to collapse, the memo said.
   According to Sullivan, he has evidence from a police investigator
that the fourth fire actually was an electrical fire, not an arson
fire.
   Sullivan also cast doubt on a confession presented by the
prosecution at the first trial.
   He said Jackson had denied any involvement in the supermarket
fire but did tell investigators that he set a fire in 1976 at
another Brooklyn store. No one was hurt in that fire.
   Slavin, who released Jackson on his own recognizance, scheduled
pretrial proceedings Dec. 12.

<HEAD>NTSB Says TWA Jet's Landing Gear Jammed After Wheel Replacement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Part of the landing gear on a TWA airliner was
replaced by inadequately trained mechanics hours before the gear
jammed, forcing an unscheduled stop at Scott Air Force Base in
Illinois, a government report said Thursday.
   However, the report by a National Transportation Safety Board
investigator did not blame either Trans World Airlines or any
individuals for the Aug. 22, 1987, mishap that left three people
with minor injuries.
   ``This report is just a finding of fact,'' NTSB spokeswoman
Drucella Andersen said. ``We have yet to issue a report which will
determine the probable cause of the accident.''
   TWA spokesman Bob Blattner in St. Louis said company officials
had no immediate comment on the investigator's report.
   The Boeing 767 with 181 people on board was en route from San
Francisco to St. Louis International Airport when its flight crew
discovered the right main landing gear would not lower into place.
   After attempts to dislodge the gear, including a dipping maneuver
intended to shake it loose, the pilot decided to avoid the crowded
St. Louis airport and land at the base a few miles across the
Mississippi River near Belleville, Ill.
   The plane landed safely on two of its three landing gears and
skidded down the runway with its right engine touching the ground.
One passenger sprained an ankle while being evacuated using
emergency slides and two others were treated for other minor
injuries, the NTSB said.
   According to the investigator's report, TWA maintenance workers
at San Francisco had replaced a tire and the brake assembly on the
failed landing gear early on the morning the airplane left for St.
Louis.
   ``The examination of the right main landing gear after the
gear-up landing revealed the brake rod separated from the brake
torque arm and had ... jammed over the top of the gear door pad,''
the report said.
   It said the workers who replaced the wheel and brake, both
experienced aircraft mechanics licensed by the Federal Aviation
Administration, told the NTSB they complied with the procedure
outlined in the maintenance manual for Boeing 767 aircraft.
   ``However, company training records showed that neither mechanic
had been trained or instructed as to the `differences' in procedures
of changing the wheel-brake assembly on the Boeing 767 and other
Boeing airplanes,'' the report said.

   The Soviet Union has bought 535,000 metric tons
of U.S. soybean meal for delivery in the 1988-89 marketing year that
began on Oct. 1, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   Earlier this week, the Soviets bought 250,000 tons of soybeans
for 1988-89 delivery, the first of the new season.
   Although no further details were announced, the meal sales could
have a value of more than $120 million, based on average USDA market
estimates of around $225 per ton in the current marketing year.
   The Soviet Union bought more than 830,000 tons of soybeans and
1.3 million tons of soybean meal in 1987-88.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said
Thursday that he will go to Europe later this month for ``one last
series of meetings'' on trade problems with the European Economic
Community.
   Lyng, who said he will leave the secretary's position Jan. 20
with the outgoing Reagan administration, will be in Brussels around
mid-November with U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter and
chief U.S. agricultural trade negotiator Daniel Amstutz. No firm
dates have been set, however.
   International trade, particularly involving the EEC and Japan,
has been at the top of Lyng's list of priorities all long, he said
in an interview. And that includes negotiations under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   Lyng said the difficult parts of GATT negotiations ``relate to
the attitudes and problems with Japan, particularly on rice,'' and
the EEC _ primarily concerning its Common Agricultural Policy, high
support prices and export subsidies.
   One of the most immediate and pressing problems Lyng hopes to
address in his talks with EEC officials is the 12-nation bloc's
determination to ban imports of meat containing traces of
growth-promoting hormones beginning Jan. 1, 1989.
   ``They're insisting they're going to implement that ban on Jan.
1,'' Lyng said. ``That would be a very serious problem for us.''
   U.S. livestock interests have estimated an EEC ban would cost
$130 million a year in lost trade.
   The Meat Industry Trade Policy Council, which includes a number
of farm, business and commodity organizations, has asked the Reagan
administration to use authority under the new trade law to cut off
meat imports from the EEC if the Jan. 1 ban goes into effect.
   Lyng said also he and Yeutter, along with other U.S. trade
officials, will attend the special meeting of the 96 member
countries of GATT, which will begin Dec. 5 in Montreal, Canada.
   After the next administration takes over on Jan. 20, Lyng, 70,
said he plans to take it easy.
   ``We have no plans to move (from the Washington area), but we
haven't made a commitment to stay where we are,'' he said. ``Have no
plans whatsoever.''
   What about starting up again in the consulting business, which
Lyng was in just before he became secretary in March 1986?
   No plans for that, either, he said. Although there may be some
``special part-time jobs'' that come up from time to time.
   ``I really want to take life at a much slower pace,'' Lyng said.

   Holiday shoppers will find ``adequate

   ``Prices will likely be higher for turkey and lower for ham than
last year,'' the department's Economic Research Service said. ``Cold
storage stocks of turkeys on Oct. 1 were 11 percent below the record
level of 1987 and will be drawn down further by holiday demands and
a fourth-quarter production under last year's level.''
   Pork production is up about 9 percent this year, the agency said
in a new outlook report.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eleven senators, following similar action by 90
House members, called Thursday for Cincinnati financier Carl Lindner
to upgrade worker safety at the John Morrell & Co. meatpacking plant
in Sioux Falls, S.D.
   ``If the guarantee of safe working conditions for any Morrell
worker is denied the conditions for all of our nation's meatpacking
workers are threatened,'' the senators' letter to Lindner said.
   It was mailed one day after 90 House members sent a similar
request concerning Morrell, the nation's fifth largest meatpacker,
which last week was fined $4.3 million for conditions at the plant.
   It was the largest fine against a single employer in the 17-year
history of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
   Lawmakers asked Lindner, chairman of Cincinnati-based American
Financial Corp., which owns Morrell, to take a more active safety
role at the plant, which has been the target of a union safety
campaign for more than a year.
   Calls to Lindner's office were referred to Morrell Chairman
Milton Schloss, who said in a telephone interview from American
Financial offices that ``this is a John Morrell matter and I'm the
one in charge of John Morrell and know the most about it.''
   Schloss said Lindner ``has taken a highly active role through me
and has been kept informed completely through me.''
   ``All the details of what we have done have been given to OSHA
and completely ignored. Period. So I don't know what else I could
do,'' he said.
   ``Some of those congressmen have gotten a letter from me
explaining what we have done,'' he said. But he said he ``received
no response whatever.''
   ``I'd be happy to talk to every single one of them to explain
what we have done if they'd be interested in listening,'' he added.
   The House letter was circulated by Reps. Frank Horton, R-N.Y.,
and Fortney ``Pete'' Stark, D-Calif., and in the Senate by Sens. Tom
Harkin, D-Iowa, and Paul Simon, D-Ill.
   Other senators signing the letter were Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass.; Lowell R. Weicker Jr., R-Conn.; John Kerry, D-Mass.; Howard
M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio; Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.; Terry Sanford,
D-N.C.; Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn.; Carl Levin, D-Mich.; and John

   The stepchildren who kept the fate of Andrei
D. Sakharov known to the world during his years of internal exile in
the Soviet Union are scrambling to prepare for his first visit to
the West.
   Sakharov is expected to arrive in Boston on Sunday for a two-week

Development of Humanity.
   The 67-year-old Nobel laureate is a member of the board of
directors of the foundation, formed in January by Soviet and
American scientists and educators to foster arms control,
environmental protection, international development and human rights.
   Sakharov is expected to travel without his wife, Yelena Bonner.
But he will start the trip by visiting two of her children who live
in Boston suburbs.
   ``We have started to prepare food for him, but we don't know
exactly what he'll want,'' Mrs. Bonner's son-in-law, Efrem
Yankelevich, said Thursday. ``There's a lot to be done, especially
preparing his schedule.''
   Yankelevich said Sakharov will go to Massachusetts General
Hospital for a cardiological examination and possible implantation
of a heart pacemaker, a procedure that usually requires a two-day
hospital stay.
   From Boston, he plans to travel to New York and Washington, but
the dates of his visits to those cities remain uncertain, relatives
said.
   Yankelevich said Sakharov hopes to be in Washington on Nov. 15,
when the Soviet physicist is expected to receive the $50,000 Albert
Einstein Foundation Peace Prize for 1988.
   But the personal highlight of the trip, Yankelevich said,
probably will be Sakharov's first meeting with Alexandra Semyonova,
the 4-year-old daughter of stepson Alexei Semyonov and his wife,
Elizaveta Alekseyeva.
   Sakharov went on hunger strikes to win permission from Soviet
authorities for his wife to come to the United States for medical
care and for Miss Alekseyeva to come here to marry Semyonov.
   For his defense of human rights in the Soviet Union, Sakharov
received the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize. Five years later, in January
1980, he was banished to Gorky, a city closed to Westerners.
   His wife also was banished there in August 1984. Both were
released in December 1986 by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Sakharov is expected to be accompanied during part of his visit
by Yevgenii Velikhov, vice president of the Soviet Academy of
Sciences, and Roald Sagdeev, director of the Soviet Space Research
Institute.
   Velikhov is chairman of the International Foundation for the
Survival and Development of Humanity, which is headquartered in
Moscow and has offices in Washington and Stockholm, Sweden. Sagdeev
is a foundation director.
   The foundation is about to embark on a worldwide fund-raising
drive with a goal of about $10 million for the first year, said its
American vice chairman, Jerome Wiesner, president emeritus of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   Wiesner said the foundation's purpose is to support research on
``what I call the modern diseases of the world _ generated by
technology, population growth, nuclear weapons and so on _ that
require cooperation by a number of countries in order to do
something about them.''
   The foundation's first board of directors meeting outside of the
Soviet Union is scheduled for Nov. 13-17 in Washington. Sakharov is
expected to attend at least part of the five-day session.
   Other American board members include Armand Hammer, chairman of
Occidental Petroleum; the Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, president emeritus
of the University of Notre Dame; Robert S. McNamara, a former U.S.
secretary of defense; and John Sculley, chief executive officer of
Apple Computer Inc.
   Gina Cella Harty, a spokeswoman for the foundation, said it is
the first non-profit, non-governmental international organization to
operate with full legal status in the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>NASA Mulling Study of Shuttle Parts Supply</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, confronting a critical shortage of a key material
for the second time this year, is planning a part-by-part study of
shuttle supplies to spot such troubles in advance.
   NASA was taken by surprise this week when the company that makes
the rayon yarn used in space shuttle rocket nozzles announced it was
closing its plant in Virginia. The Avtex Fibers facility is the only
one in the country producing the yarn.
   NASA faced a similar crisis in May when the Henderson, Nev.,
plant of Pacific Engineering and Production Co. was destroyed in an
explosion and fire. The plant was one of only two producing ammonium
perchlorate, the oxidizer in the solid fuel that powers the
shuttle's booster rockets.
   No one at NASA headquarters or at the agency's Marshall Space
Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., would say Thursday how many other
materials used for shuttle flights have only a single supplier.
   However, sources who declined to be identified said shuttle
program boss Richard Truly was concerned enough to order a thorough
study to identify other critical parts with only one supplier.
   Rockwell International Corp. builds the shuttle at its Palmdale,
Calif., plant but depends on more than 250 subcontractors for
various systems and components.
   The presidential commission that investigated the Challenger
disaster criticized the space agency for not having enough spares on
hand, which fostered a practice of borrowing parts from one shuttle
for use on another.
   That problem has not been completely solved. After the flight of
Discovery last month, engineers found evidence of a leak in one
engine. They had to borrow an engine from shuttle Columbia to
prepare Discovery for its next mission.
   The impact of the fuel and nozzle problems won't be felt for more
than a year. An allocation board that included the Defense
Department, NASA and other government agencies met recently to
divide up ammonium perchlorate production.
   ``We have been allocated sufficient quantities for nine flight
sets,'' said Rocky Raab, spokesman for Morton Thiokol in Utah. ``The
allocation board meets again in early 1989 to make additional
allocations, so presuming Pepcon (Pacific Engineering) gets the
plant going again in early or mid-1989 that would mitigate that
situation.''
   Only the late-November flight of Atlantis remains this year and
there are seven more missions scheduled for 1989.
   The ammonium perchlorate manufacturer is rebuilding its plant in
Henderson and has broken ground for a new facility for finishing
work in Cedar City, Utah. ``Presuming everything goes as planned,
our concerns about the fuel are minimized,'' Raab said.
   It is too soon to know what will be done about Avtex which began
closing its plant at Front Royal, Va., on Thursday and letting its
1,300 employees go. ``Production, for all intents and purposes, is
stopping today,'' said Avtex spokesman Nick Nichols. ``People will
be working for the next couple of days to shut it down and secure
it.''
   Morton Thiokol, NASA, the Pentagon and other contractors were
talking with Avtex in hopes of finding a solution to the shutdown.
Raab said Thiokol had enough material for 10 flight sets.
   ``It's a possibility that rayon might be available elsewhere, but
it has to be a qualified source,'' he said. Rayon is the root stock
for what ends up as carbon phenolic, a fireproof material that lines
the inside of the booster nozzle. The same cloth is used to make
nozzles for MX missiles, small intercontinental missiles and the
Trident II system.
   ``You can't force somebody to manufacture some product,'' Raab
said.

   The Navy on Thursday awarded a $242.8 million
contract to the National Steel and Shipbuilding Co. for a new combat
supplies ship.
   The contract won by the San Diego, Calif.-based firm calls for
work on the new vessel to be completed by June 1992. It was awarded
Thursday by the Naval Sea Systems Command.
   The ship, part of the so-called AOE-6 class, will be 753 feet
long, 107 feet wide and displace about 48,500 tons when fully
loaded. The ship is designed to carry fuel, ammunition and stores
for carrier battle groups and has the speed and armament to remain
in convoy with the combat ships.

   A woman trying to move a revolver out of the
reach of her three young children shot and killed her 7-year-old
daughter, police said.
   Rochell Porter was shot once in the left cheek with a .25-caliber
pistol Wednesday. She died at Brackenridge Hospital shortly
afterward.
   Travis County Medical Examiner Robert Bayardo on Thursday ruled
the death a homicide.
   ``Homicide merely means that a person's life has been taken by
another,'' Bayardo said.``But this was very reckless. The girl was
shot at very close range.''
   The ruling, he said, ``indicates a higher degree than just
accidental death.''
   The pistol was on a table when the girl's mother, Ulene Porter,
37, was getting Rochell and her 9-year-old sister ready for school,
said Sgt. Don Bredl. A 2-year-old girl also was at home when the
shooting occurred, he said.
   Police spokesman C.F. Adams said Ms. Porter told investigators
one of the girls moved an ashtray that nudged the gun, prompting her
to take the pistol away. She told officers she was turning around
with the gun in her hand when it fired once.
   ``Her mother's just very crushed, understandably so,'' Adams
said. ``She had a handgun because of problems she's had in the past
with burglars and prowlers and the like.''
   Two burglaries and eight domestic disturbances had been reported
to police from an apartment where the woman lived until recently.
   Police plan to forward the results of their investigation to the
Travis County district attorney.
   ``The facts, details remain the same,'' Adams said. ``We're not
going to go out and arrest the woman.''

   Alcoholics with acute liver disease should
not be required to stop drinking to become eligible for liver
transplants, because they are as likely to benefit from the
procedure as anyone else, researchers said.
   ``To the extent that objections to liver transplantation are
moralistic, these undermine the modern understanding of alcoholism
including the recognition that this is a treatable disease, not a
vice,'' the researchers said in a report in Friday's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh and Veterans
Administration Medical Center in Pittsburgh reviewed cases of 56
patients with alcoholic cirrhosis who received liver transplants in
Pittsburgh and Denver from 1963 to June 1987. Thirty-five of the
patients survived six months or longer.
   In general, 70 percent of patients with other forms of liver
disease who receive a transplant survive at least one year.
   Alcoholic cirrhosis occurs when a person's liver no longer can
remove toxic substances, such as alcohol, from the blood. About 20
percent of chronic alcoholics suffer from this disease.
   Although only a small number of alcoholics would qualify for
liver transplants because of other ailments, those who do qualify
stand a good chance of surviving, the researchers said.
   ``Since 1980, the results with alcoholic patients have been as
good as in adult patients with a broad spectrum of other (liver)
diseases,'' they said. ``In fact, the results have been better than
with diseases that can recur in the transplanted liver,'' such as
type B hepatitis, cancerous liver tumors, or Budd-Chiari syndrome,
in which the liver's blood vessels are malformed.
   The researchers, led by Dr. Thomas Starzl of the University of
Pittsburgh, said criticism over treating alcoholic cirrhosis with
liver transplants is based on the mistaken view that alcoholism is a
moral failure. The authors said they wanted to compare the merit of
liver transplants against the criticism.
   The authors said no patient was required to stop drinking to
receive a liver transplant. They argue that such a waiting period
would be medically unsound or even inhumane as it would allow the
patient's medical condition to deteriorate and reduce the patient's
chances of survival.
   In one such case, described in a commentary written by three
researchers from the National Council on Alcoholism and published in
the journal in March, a young alcoholic man was twice denied
Medicaid funding for a liver transplant, despite being sober for six
months.
   The decisions were based on a Michigan Department of Social
Service requirement mandating a two-year period of abstinence before
transplantation. The decision was challenged in court and
overturned, but the young man died before the transplant could be
arranged.
   Of 41 Pittsburgh alcoholics in the study, 34 patients had stopped
drinking before they were admitted to the hospital. Seven continued
drinking until admission to the hospital. Three of those died and
four were alive after 22 to 26 months.
   All but two of the 56 alcoholics who received new livers no
longer drank after the operation, the researchers said, noting that
the two ``appeared to resent what had been done while they were in a
coma or mentally incompetent.'' One was from the Denver group, the
other from the Pittsburgh patients.
   Wanda Bond of the United Network for Organ Sharing, which runs
the federal Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, said
1,159 livers were transplanted last year.
   Very few hospitals require alcoholics to stop drinking in order
to become eligible for liver transplants, said Thelma Thiel, a
spokeswoman for the American Liver Foundation.
   But she said the foundation has expressed concerns about the lack
of a required period of abstinence prior to receiving a donated
liver because of the fear that the alcoholics would continue
drinking and damage their transplanted livers. She said researchers
must continue investigating the successful use of transplants to
treat alcoholic cirrhosis.
   Dr. Allan Wolkoff, a researcher specializing in liver function
and a professor of medicine at the Albert Einstein College of
Medicine, said previous consensus statements issued by the National
Institutes of Health have mentioned concerns about the use of liver
transplants as a form of treatment for alcoholic cirrhosis without
requiring abstinence.
   The illness' side effects _ bleeding, salt retention and blood
pressure problems _ can increase the risks of surgery and lower the
life expectancy of a transplant recipient, he said.
   Wolkoff said the ``potentially important'' Pittsburgh study could
represent a ``changing of minds'' on the use of liver transplants.

<HEAD>Researchers: More Than 10 Percent of Medical Students Suffer
Depression</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK PERKISS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 12 percent of students at one large
medical school showed major symptoms of depression, says a new study
of the stresses on future doctors.
   ``The spring of the second year of medical school appeared to be
the most distressing period,'' said the study, published in Friday's
Journal of the American Medical Association.
   The four-year study involved a class of 121 students at Rush
Medical College in Chicago. It was conducted by David Clark,
associate professor of psychiatry at the school, and Peter Zeldow,
associate professor of psychiatry at Chicago's Northwestern
University Medical School.
   ``The study documents what many medical educators have long
assumed, which is that medical school is a depressing place to be if
you're a medical student,'' Zeldow said Thursday.
   The two researchers said depression in students was caused, in
part, by the stresses involved in attending medical school.
   ``It's just a pressure cooker, and if we dropped any
cross-section of the population into it they would get depressed,''
Clark said.
   But the type of people who go to medical school is also a factor.
``The qualities that make you a conscientious, fanatical student
have a cost,'' Clark said.
   ``The majority of medical students are quite unhappy or
miserable, whether they are suffering from depression or not,''
Zeldow said.
   He added that ``there's no doubt that medical schools themselves
are part of the problem _ that the curricula they provide are too
dense with information. There's no doubt inadequate attention is
paid to the emotional needs of the students.''
   At any point in students' four years in medical school, at least
12 percent of the doctors-in-training show signs of depression, the
study said.
   The authors emphasized that the study did not use official
medical diagnoses of depression, and said that they couldn't say
whether surveys at other medical schools would necessarily show
similar findings.
   The authors found no significant differences between the
percentage of men and women medical students showing symptoms of
depression.
   At the end of the second year, the figure of those showing
symptoms of depression rises to about 25 percent, and then it
recedes, Zeldow said.
   ``There's something wrong if medical school can't make it fun and
exciting,'' Clark said. ``It's the joylessness in their education
that I'm worried about.''
   By contrast, only about 5 percent of the U.S. population suffers
from depression, the researchers said.
   ``Depression in the students is not likely to affect patient care
because medical students have so much supervision,'' Zeldow said.
``They have interns, residents and attending physicians looking over
everything they do,''
   But the two researchers differed on whether depression suffered
by medical students would influence the care they give patients when
they become practicing physicians.
   ``If a medical student is treated badly and a student's emotional
needs are ignored during training, then there is a greater chance
they will ignore the psychological needs of their patients,'' Zeldow
said.
   But in an interview, Clark said there was no evidence that
students who suffer from depression while in medical school ``will
have depression when they're in practice.''
   The study used questionnaires filled out by students and
evaluated by using a scale known as the Beck Depression Inventory, a
21-item measure of symptoms of depression, the researchers said.
   The symptoms of depression found in students included sleep
disturbance, pessimism, sense of failure, suicidal wishes and loss
of sex drive, the study said.
   Students who were very depressed were more likely to drop out of
medical school regardless of how well they were doing academically,
the study said.

   Foreign mercenaries tried to take over
the Maldives and Indian paratroopers spread out early Friday in
Male, the capital, to aid embattled President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom,
Maldivian officials said.
   Two officials reported Gayoom was safe and one added: ``The
situation is under control. Everybody is all right.''
   A senior Sri Lankan government official said at least 12 people
were killed and 22 wounded when about 150 mercenaries attacked Male,
a city of 55,000 people, before dawn Thursday.
   The hired attackers were thought to be Tamils from Sri Lanka,
about 400 miles east of Maldives in the Indian Ocean, diplomatic
sources in Colombo said.
   Maldivian officials said shooting died down after the Indian
troops arrived.
   A senior Sri Lankan military official said former President
Ibrahim Nasir of the Maldives was behind the attempt to overthrow
Gayoom, who succeeded Nasir in 1978 and was re-elected to a third
five-year term Sept. 23.
   Maldives has a population of about 189,000, most of them Sunni
Moslems, spread across a 500-mile chain of small, low-lying coral
islands known for fishing and glistening tourist beaches.
   The Maldivian officials, contacted by telephone from New Delhi,
spoke on condition their names not be used.
   A Maldivian police official said Indian paratroopers were
deploying in Male.
   Some mercenaries fled by boat, a Maldivian security official
said. He said he saw Indian troops in the streets of Male but he did
not know what happened to any remaining mercenaries.
   A Western diplomatic source in Colombo said his reports indicated
the mercenaries inflicted heavy grenade and bullet damage on
government buildings before the Indians arrived.
   The raiders apparently came ashore from fishing trawlers before
dawn Thursday and attacked military headquarters next to the
presidential palace.
   Press Trust of India said 1,600 Indian paratroopers were sent
after an emergency meeting of the Cabinet political affairs
committee and three Indian warships also headed to Male.
   Diplomats in Colombo and New Delhi said before the Indian
soldiers arrived that Gayoom's troops were in general control of
Male but the attackers held the radio and television stations and
the Islamic College.
   Two large military aircraft thought to be Indian troop transports
landed at the Maldives airport on Hulule Island, next to Male
Island, two diplomats in Colombo reported.
   Indian government sources in New Delhi said the paratroopers flew
from bases in south India about 475 miles northeast of Male. The
sources in both the Indian and Sri Lankan capitals spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Gayoom appealed for help to India, the United States and Britain.
   Britain said it was considering the request for help. In
Washington, the State Department denied reports that a U.S. Navy
carrier group was steaming in the direction of Male.
   Ahmed Abdullah Aziz, the Maldivian ambassador to Sri Lanka, said
the mercenaries spoke Tamil. A Western diplomat said they were
recruited from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the largest
Tamil guerrilla group waging a separatist war in Sri Lanka. The
Tamils, mainly Hindus, claim discrimination by the majority
Sihalese, who are mostly Buddhists.
   India, the region's main military power, has had tens of
thousands of soldiers in Sri Lanka for 15 months in an attempt to
disarm the guerrillas under a peace agreement. India has become
involved because it is a regional power and because of its own large
Tamil population in the south.
   The military official who spoke of involvement by Nasir said the
former president's followers mounted an unsuccessful coup in 1980.
Nasir moved to Singapore after retiring from the presidency in 1978.
   ``Foreign invaders speaking Tamil invaded the capital of Male in
an attempt to overthrow the legally constituted government of the
Maldives. Their attempt failed,'' Aziz, the Maldivian ambassador,
said at midafternoon Thursday.
   Several senior Maldivian officials, including at least two
Cabinet ministers, were taken hostage but Gayoom and his closest
advisers escaped, Western diplomats said.
   Heavy fire continued for about four hours until government troops
ordered the attackers to surrender, the diplomats said. They refused
and sporadic gunfire continued throughout the night.
   Electricity was cut off in Male and most people stayed off the
streets, several Male residents said when reached telephone.
   ``As long as we stay indoors, it seems safe,'' said a Sri Lankan
pharmacist in Male.
   The Maldives consist of 1,200 coral islands and 800 islets, but
only about 140 are inhabited. Fine beaches and clear water teeming
with tropical fish have made the archipelago a magnet for tourists,
mostly from Western Europe and Japan.
   Tourists generally do not stay on Male, where strict Islamic
rules apply. The government has set aside special islands where
visitors can wear scanty costumes and drink the alcohol forbidden to
Maldivians.
   The Maldivians display mixed Sinhalese, Dravidian and Arab traits.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir refused demands by
possible coalition partners Thursday to annex the occupied lands and
expel Palestinians from them, but he supports more Jewish
settlements, an aide said.
   The United States considers such settlements in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip an obstacle to peace between Israel and its Arab
neighbors.
   Violence continued in the occupied territories, where a rebellion
that began Dec. 8, 1987, has cost the lives of 10 Israelis and more
than 300 Palestinians. Israeli soldiers blew up three Palestinian
houses Thursday and sealed another, and 11 Palestinians were
reported wounded by army gunfire.
   Sources in the Labor Party said Foreign Minister Shimon Peres
might be dumped as leader after the center-left party's poor showing
in Tuesday's general election.
   Critics say the Labor campaign focused too closely on Peres'
personality and his support for an international conference on
Middle East peace, an Arab demand that stirs controversy in Israel.
   Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc, which has been in a tenuous
``national unity'' government with Labor since indecisive 1984
elections, opposes a conference and wants to retain all the lands
captured in the 1967 war. Peres has expressed willingness to trade
some land for peace.
   Likud won 40 seats in the 120-member parliament, one more than
Labor, according to revised official figures that added one seat to
each party's total. Likud seeks to end its coalition with Labor and
form an alliance with small religious and rightist parties.
   Labor also has courted religious parties, but its chances for a
coalition are considered slim.
   Leaders of the National Religious Party, which has five seats, on
Thursday ruled out a coalition with the Labor Party and said they
preferred joining a government headed by the right-wing Likud bloc.
   The 73-year-old prime minister expressed confidence Thursday that
he could form a government. ``I can't give an exact date, but I hope
it won't take long,'' he said on Israel television.
   He completed a first round of coalition talks Thursday after
meeting with the Moledet (Homeland) and Tzomet (Crossroads) parties,
which want to annex the occupied territories. Ech has two seats in
the Knesset, as Israel's parliament is called.
   Moledet also demands the expulsion to Arab countries of the 1.5
million Palestinians living in the territories. Party leader Rehavam
Zeevi, a retired general, calls the policy ``transfer.''
   ``Shamir clarified that the idea of transfer will not be included
in the guidelines of the next government,'' said Yossi Ahimeir, the
prime minister's aide. ``The concept is rejected by the Likud.''
   Zeevi said he would join a Likud government even without
acceptance of his platform.
   Ahimeir said Shamir also told Tzomet and the right-wing party
Tehiya that annexing the West Bank and Gaze would violate the 1978
Camp David accords that led to the 1979 peace treaty with Egypt. The
accords call for negotiations on Palestinian autonomy and the final
status of the occupied lands.
   Shamir agreed, however, that a government led by Likud would
increase Jewish settlement in the occupied territories dramatically,
Ahimeir said, and ``the only restraint will be economic
considerations.''
   The Jerusalem Post quoted Tehiya sources as saying a settlement
boom would crush any peace moves based on Palestinian autonomy,
making formal renunciation of the Camp David accords unnecessary.
   Gush Emunim, a settlement movement, said Thursday it plans 50 new
settlements in the next three years and may start building 11 this
month. About 70,000 Jews now live in 131 settlements in the West
Bank and Gaza.
   Israeli media speculated about Cabinet posts in a Likud coalition
and generally agreed that Moshe Arens, a hard-liner allied with
Shamir, was the leading candidate for defense minister.
   Ariel Sharon, a former defense minister, wants the job again but
speculation was that he would become police minister and strengthen
border police units in the occupied territories. During the
campaign, Sharon said security forces should form special squads to
``eliminate terrorists and rioters.''
   Shamir said he has neither chosen ministers nor approached
candidates.

<HEAD>New Study Indicates Voter Registration Is Down This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The percentage of the voting-eligible public
that is registered this election cycle is down 2.2 percent from
1984, according to a private study released Thursday that said
Republicans have gained while Democrats have lost.
   The study projects a national registration of 129,483,000, or
70.9 percent of the voting-eligible population, compared with
127,500,000, or 73.1 percent, four years ago.
   Based on the results, as well as other indications of low public
interest in the campaign, the authors of the study predicted that
voter turnout next Tuesday would decline below 52.5 percent, making
it the lowest since the 51.1 percent of 1948. Voter participation in
1984 was 53.1 percent.
   The percentage of registered voters drops when new registrations
fail to keep pace with the growth in the country's voting-age
population, or with the deaths of registered voters or with the
number of voters who move and fail to re-register.
   The study, based on preliminary registration figures from 30
states and the District of Columbia, was conducted by the Committee
for the Study of the American Electorate, a non-partisan group that
monitors voter participation.
   The study said that from 1984 to 1988 the Republican Party's
share of the voting-eligible public in 16 of the states studied
increased 2.1 percent to 24.4 percent. That brought the number of
GOP registered voters in those states to 16,050,098, compared with
13,764,907 in 1984.
   The Democratic share, meanwhile, dropped 2.3 percent to 35.9
percent, for a total of 23,630,915 registered voters in the 16
states, compared with 23,579,425 in 1984.
   Republicans made gains in 11 states and the District of Columbia,
headed by Louisiana with an increase of 3.3 percent. Democrats
recorded losses in 13 of the 16 states, adding significantly to
their rolls only in the District of Columbia, up 3.1 percent.
   ``If there is a trend in these figures, it seems the GOP is
picking up strength in the South at the expense of the Democrats,''
Curtis Gans, director of the committee, wrote in his summation.
   Only three states reported gains in registration this year:
Nevada, up 5.5 percent; Arizona, up 4.5 percent; and Virginia, up
0.2 percent. The other 27 reported declines, with Alaska leading at
11 percent.
   While there was less money and less effort directed at voter
registration than in 1984, the study said, several states have
liberalized their registration laws.
   ``It is becoming abundantly clear that the erosion in the quality
of our politics, made evident by this year's campaign, is
undermining the citizen's will to vote,'' Gans said.
   The 40-year declining trend in voter participation, interrupted
briefly in 1984, makes the United States the democracy with the
lowest participation in the world, he said.

<HEAD>Black-White Infant Mortality Rate Gap Widens, Group Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The gap between the mortality rate for black
and white infants born in the United States continues to widen, a
children's advocacy group said Thursday.
   The Children's Defense Fund, basing its study on data released by
the National Center for Health Statistics, a federal agency, said it
found a black-white infant mortality ratio of 2.02 in 1986, the most
recent year for which figures were available.
   The findings mean a black baby was more than twice as likely to
die in infancy as a white baby. That compared to a 1.96 ratio in
1985 and 1.69 in 1940.
   It added that, while the death rates among black and white
infants for non-preventable birth defects was virtually identical,
black babies were far more likely to die of preventable causes such
as inadequate prenatal care.
   They were four times more likely to die of prematurity and low
birth weight, three times more likely to die of pneumonia, influenza
and homicide and two times more likely to die as a result of newborn
and maternal complications, infections and accidents, the fund said.
   Overall, the U.S. infant mortality rate declined slightly from
10.6 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1985 to 10.4 in 1986.
   The mortality rate for black infants in 1986 was 18 per 1,000
births and, for white infants, 8.9 per 1,000 births.

<HEAD>Church Urges Gestures Of Reconciliation in Chile</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Roman Catholic Church in Chile urged
both the military government and the opposition on Thursday to make
some gestures of reconciliation to ensure a smooth transition to
democracy.
   In a written statement, Monsignor Carlos Gonzalez, president of
Chile's Bishops Conference, suggested that government gestures could
include:
   _Speeding up trials of political prisoners.
   _``A real reform'' of the political police force, which has been
widely accused of torturing prisoners.
   _``Claryfing so many facts that have not yet been duly explained
to the nation's public opinion'' _ a reference to human rights
violations that occurred after the military took power in a bloody
1973 coup headed by Gen. Augusto Pinochet, now president.
   _Ending the 1{-year internal exile imposed last month on the
nation's two top labor leaders for calling an illegal general strike
last year.
   ``I submit these facts as gestures that would help in promoting a
climate of peace that we all desire,'' Gonzalez said.
   He said the opposition should recognize the economic achievements
under the Pinochet government, but added, ``It must also be accepted
that the social distribution of the economy requires policies that
take into account in a wider manner the dignity and the respect that
workers deserve.''
   Gonzalez said gestures are needed following the Oct. 5
referendum, in which voters rejected a military proposal that
Pinochet, who has ruled since the coup, remain in power until 1997.
   ``It is not good for the country to ignore the referendum and
believe that everything remains unchanged,'' the prelate said.
``Signs and gestures of rapprochement are needed from both sides.''
   Under the 1980 constitution, the Pinochet defeat in the
referendum makes an open presidential election mandatory in December
1989, with the president and army commander handling over power to
the winner in March, 1990.
   The opposition has asked a dialogue with the military on proposed
constitutional changes, including an earlier departure of Pinochet
from power.
   Pinochet has rejected opposition demands.
   ``One fact that can be drawn from the referendum is that Chileans
want to follow a pace of respect, dialogue and peace,'' Gonzalez
said in his statement.

   Here are excerpts from Michael Dukakis' campaign appearances
Thursday.
   
   In front of Philadelphia City Hall:
   
   ``We're coming on strong all across this country. We're coming on
strong here in Pennsylvania...
   ``I know the Republicans are trying to do a little celebrating,
they're already popping their champagne corks in their penthouses. I
meant to tell them something, we're the ones who are going to be
celebrating on the 8th of November and we're going to be celebrating
with a bottle of beer and a cheesesteak. ...
   ``I'm working and I'm for working with other countries. ... But
if they don't want to work with us, I'll be damned if I'll let them
get away with running those drugs into this country and poisoning
our children.
   ``I'll tell foreign leaders, if you're prepared to work with us,
we'll work with you. But if you're against us, don't expect a dime
in foreign aid. ...
   ``If you think you can do to Mike Dukakis what Noriega did to
George Bush, if you think that we'll risk the lives of our children
and their futures and the futures of our communities by putting Dan
Quayle in charge of the war against drugs, then you're going to be
in for a very big surprise on Jan. 20, 1989.
   ``The difference between George Bush and me is this: his
administration has cut deals with foreign drug runners, I'm going to
cut aid to foreign drug runners.''
   
   At a Newark airport rally:
   
   ``Like another son of New Jersey (Bruce Springsteen), I was born
to run and born to win....
   ``I know Boston Harbor is polluted. So is the Republican
campaign. The difference is I'm cleaning up Boston Harbor.''

<HEAD>Age-Old Gravestone Art Ban Sparks Lawsuit By Jewish Families</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leon Rader, an artist whose canvas is a
gravestone, says the art he brought from the Ukraine to the city in
1980 made him popular for years among Soviet Jews who emigrated to
the San Francisco Bay area.
   Now he says he's stunned and angered that his age-old art has
been banned by what may be the city's only Jewish funeral home.
   Rader, who learned his craft from an old master back in
Chernovtzy, engraves delicate, life-like portraits of the deceased
on gleaming black granite headstones.
   ``This is a Russian Jewish tradition,'' said Ella Portnoy, whose
aunt Lia Solganik died last January.
   ``When you come to the cemetery, that's how you want to see them,
the way you want to rememeber them,'' she said.
   Portnoy and the family of another deceased emigre sued Sinai
Memorial Chapel; Eternal Home Cemetery; and Sinai director Gene B.
Kaufman, charging them in Superior Court with grave desecration.
They are seeking $1 million in damages.
   Eternal Home's policy is set by Sinai, a spokeswoman said. The
Associated Press could not reach Sinai attorney William E. Joost for
comment on Wednesday.
   Rader, however, said Sinai officials told him the ban was because
it is against Jewish religion to have graven images. Photographs of
the deceased are allowed to be placed into the tombstones.
   Rader, a tall, talkative man with a rich Russian accent, called
the ban ``unbelievable.''
   Rader learned sculpture and painting at an art academy in the
Soviet Union, later working in an ``artists' factory'' painting
giant canvasses of Lenin and Marx and other murals glorifying the
workers' revolution.
   Later, he studied gravestone art with ``an old master working in
a cemetery at Chernovtzy, in the Ukraine, near the Romanian border.
   ``You cannot learn this from nobody,'' Rader said. ``This
technique is a secret technique. To do this, you have to be an
artist.
   ``You have to know the material. ... Granite does not forgive a
mistake,'' he said.
   Rader came to the city in 1980 and in 1984 opened Art Stone
Monuments, his business located near Colma, a community of
graveyards south of San Francisco.
   The dispute began this fall when Rader installed an engraving of
a popular member of the Russian Jewish emigre community despite the
ban.
   According to attorney Richard A. Canatella, Sinai officials were
angry and visited Rader's shop to inspect gravestones for Solganik
who died in January at 74, and Simyon Flek, who died in April at 57.
   Despite protests by the family that they would use the required
stone, cemetery workers dug up huge foundations for gravestones at
the head of both graves.
   Rader said the Torah teaches that the soul of the dead resides at
the grave for 11 months.
   ``They disturbed her peace,'' said Portnoy, as tears formed in
her eyes.
   ``I can't even talk about it,'' she said.

   A man who rescued a woman from two muggers by
killing one and wounding the other was ordered held without bail
Thursday on an outstanding warrant for a 1987 drug conviction.
   ``He's a drug seller and he has a gun,'' said state Supreme Court
Justice Joseph Slavin. ``I'm not going to let him out.''
   ``To certain portions of the populace he's a hero, to me he's a
routine bench warrant,'' the judge added.
   Clovis Fearom, 31, bowed his head as a court officer handcuffed
him and led him out of the Brooklyn courtroom.
   Fearom had told police his name was Anthony Dixon after he came
to the rescue of 43-year-old Gertrude George early Wednesday in the
Flatbush section of Brooklyn.
   His true identity and the outstanding arrest were discovered
through fingerprints taken after he was charged with illegal gun
possession because the gun he used on the attackers was not licensed.
   It turned out that Fearom had pleaded guilty on Feb. 9, 1987, to
third-degree criminal sale of a controlled substance. He failed to
appear for sentencing and a warrant was issued on March 23, 1987.
   His attorney, Paul Asher, made an emotional plea to Slavin,
asking that Fearom not be incarcerated.
   ``This is a man who risked life and limb to save a woman. That's
the appropriate focus of this case,'' Asher said, addng that Fearom
had been a law-abiding citizen of late and had a job as a chef at a
Brooklyn restaurant.
   But Slavin angrily disagreed.
   ``He's violated his trust to me by not returning for
sentencing,'' the judge said. ``He's not getting out, period.''
   Slavin noted that when he scheduled the man's original sentencing
date in 1987, he warned him that failure to appear would result in a
two-to-six-year prison sentence. Fearom had been promised a sentence
of five years probation if he appeared for sentencing.
   The judge said he would sentence Fearom in three weeks after a
probation report is prepared.
   According to police, Fearom was inside his apartment at about 1
a.m. Wednesday when he heard a commotion outside and saw two men
attacking Ms. George.
   Ms. George, a longtime neighborhood resident, was returning home
after work as a nurse at St. Clare's Hospital in Manhattan, police
said.
   Timothy Lewis, 25, of Brooklyn, one of the men shot by Fearom,
was arrested for robbery, assault and criminal possession of stolen
property. The other alleged bandit, Raymond Plowden, 25, of
Brooklyn, was found dead a block from the scene, still clutching Ms.
George's jewelry.
   Lewis escaped but was arrested a short time later when he arrived
at Brookdale Hospital for treatment of his gunshot wound, police
said. He was in stable condition there.
   Ms. George had said earlier that Fearom was ``the only one who
came to my assistance.''
   ``It could have been me dead,'' Ms. George said. ``The guy that
died showed me no mercy.''
   Ms. George suffered cuts and bruises to her face in the incident,
but declined treatment for her injuries, police said.

<HEAD>Estonia in Furor Over Proposed Constitutional Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Estonians are unhappy about proposed amendments to
the Soviet constitution because they would abolish the right of
republics to secede and shift the balance of power toward Russia,
residents of the Baltic republic say.
   Newspapers in Estonia are filled with complaints, said the
residents, who spoke on condition their names not be used. They said
the complainers include even some Communist Party officials, who say
they had no voice in the constitutional revisions presented by
Moscow two weeks ago.
   Estonia's ruling Presidium is to consider the Kremlin's
constitutional and election reforms Friday and may recommend
rejecting the entire package, the residents said.
   ``The newspapers say the amendments make the constitution even
more anti-democratic that it is at the present moment,'' one
Estonian resident said.
   Another declared: ``It's no good for anything. It's certainly not
more democratic, like they promised at the (Communist) party
conference'' in June.
   Of primary concern to Estonia is a clause giving the new national
Congress of People's Deputies power to determine the composition of
the Soviet Union, a resident explained. The current constitution
grants each republic the right of self-determination.
   All three Baltic republics _ Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania _ have
developed strong independent political organizations in the past six
months that pressed greater autonomy from Moscow. Demands have
included the right to print their own currency and control their own
foreign trade.
   The revised constitution ``gives power to the national
legislature over economic issues, and we were expecting to increase
our control over our republic economy,'' one Estonian said.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms would create a new
congress with two-thirds of the members elected by the public and
one-third chosen by certain organizations. It would would meet once
a year to elect a working Supreme Soviet parliament and the national
president.
   Estonians also are upset because more seats are assigned to the
so-called autonomous regions and territories, almost all within the
Russian republic, which they say will shift power to the Russians.
   Under the new allocation plan, the proportion of seats held by
the Russian republic in the Soviet of Nationalities, one of the two
houses of the Supreme Soviet, will go from 32 percent to 43, said
the Estonian newspaper Maalaht.
   One resident said Estonians are trying to stir the other 13
non-Russian republics to join them in opposing the changes. The
Estonian Academy of Sciences has denounced the amendments and sent
copies of its objections to its counterparts in other parts of the
Soviet Union, he said.
   The Estonian Popular Front, a broad-based independent political
group, ``has appealed to all citizens of Estonia to send copies of
the decisions to their friends in other republics because the
all-union (national) media cannot be trusted,'' the resident said.
   Major Soviet media have not mentioned the Estonian complaints,
although they have printed articles about the reforms.

<TEXT>
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
told Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski Thursday that the West would provide
financial aid to Poland when authorities begin ``real dialogue''
with Solidarity.
   Mrs. Thatcher made the comments to the Communist Party chief at a
banquet hours after she honored the memory of a slain pro-Solidarity
priest at a Warsaw church.
   Hundreds of supporters of the banned independent trade union
movement who had gathered at the church shouted to her that they
represent the real Poland.
   ``Here is Poland! Here is Poland!'' the crowd chanted as Mrs.
Thatcher walked into the yard of the St. Stanislaw Kostka Church to
lay a wreath on the grave of the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko.
   At the banquet hosted by the Polish leader, Mrs. Thatcher said in
a toast that she was planning to go to Gdansk Friday to hear the
views of Solidarity leaders.
   She suggested that Jaruzelski too should listen to Solidarity,
which was outlawed after the imposition of martial law in 1981 but
is still the focal point of opposition to the communist government.
   ``Freedom and responsibility go hand in hand. Those who seek the
one must be prepared to offer the other,'' Mrs. Thatcher said.
``That is why it is so vital that there should be real dialogue with
representatives of all sections of society, including Solidarity.''
   For reforms to succeed, Mrs. Thatcher said, ``people have to be
involved in decisions about the way forward.''
   ``When that happens,'' she added, ``when that great day comes,
you will find your friends ready, not just to stand and cheer, but
to help in practical ways: by supporting a program with the IMF (the
International Monetary Fund), by offering credits, by rescheduling
debts, by encouraging investment and by establishing joint
ventures.''
   A British official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
prime minister's remarks could be seen as a reply to repeated
requests for aid from Britain in helping Poland cope with its
crushing $39 billion foreign debt.
   Jaruzelski responded that Poland had suffered greatly through its
history and Western countries which suffered less should not be too
quick to judge it.
   ``Our nation walked a thorny path. ... hence it knows well the
cost of security and stability of one's own state,'' he said in
remarks released in advance. ``No one today, looking from the
elevation of affluence .... should forget that.''
   Mrs. Thatcher and Jaruzelski conferred together for three hours
before the banquet, which culminated the second day of Mrs.
Thatcher's three-day state visit to Poland.
   The British official said Jaruzelski ``gave the impression that
he intended to embark on a radical set of reforms and acknowledged
these were essential.''
   Earlier Thursday, Mrs. Thatcher met with Prime Minister
Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski for a second time and visited a market.
   St. Stanislaw Kostka Church was the parish of Popieluszko, a
charismatic Roman Catholic priest who was abducted, beaten and
drowned in 1984 by four secret policemen who later were imprisoned.
   The crowd broke into a traditional hymn, ``God Watches Over
Poland,'' after Mrs. Thatcher placed the red, white and blue wreath
of roses, lilies and irises on the tombstone.
   The churchyard was lined with Solidarity banners, and an honor
guard of steelworkers stood by holding flags of the banned union.
   Shaking her head in apparent sadness, Mrs. Thatcher spoke with
Popieluszko's gaunt, elderly parents, Marianna and Wladyslaw.
   ``We are extremely grateful that she found the time to come
here,'' said Mrs. Popieluszko. ``We know that deep in her heart she
has been with our beloved son. We know she supports people suffering
in Poland.''
   Mrs. Thatcher, who is popular in Poland, has said she doesn't
want to interfere in Poland's internal affairs during her visit,
which began Wednesday. Both the opposition and the government have
been hoping to gain from her trip.
   The government would like Mrs. Thatcher's endorsement of tough
economic policies and her help with its debt crisis, while the
opposition hopes she will speak out for greater freedom.
   The government said Wednesday it was making a new approach to
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa about starting talks with the
opposition. Walesa said Thursday he would not reply to the approach
until after Mrs. Thatcher's departure Friday, but he said he would
continue to refuse to alter Solidarity's delegation to the talks,
which has been the stumbling block.
   ``She can give a push to the Polish government to come to terms
with reality, and reality is the existence of Solidarity,'' the
union's national spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz said in a British
television interview.
   In her talks with Rakowski, Mrs. Thatcher stonewalled an appeal
for Western aid, said a British official speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Rakowski said the $39 billion foreign debt was ``like a noose
'round our necks,'' and appealed for Western help, the official
said. ``The prime minister did not respond,'' he said.

<HEAD>Airlines Do Better Job At Holding Down Flight Delays, Mishandled
Bags</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The major airlines in September did their best
job of holding down flight delays and mishandled bags since they
started reporting flight information 13 months ago, the
Transportation Department said Thursday.
   The 13 largest domestic carriers reported that 85.6 percent of
their flights were on time in September, up from 83 percent in
August and the best showing since the department began requiring
large carriers to report the information in September l987.
   The best previous month had been June, when 84.3 percent of
flights were on time. It was the sixth month in a row that the
airlines reported at least 80 percent of their flights arriving
within 15 minutes of schedule, which is considered on time by the
government.
   Eastern Airlines, which throughout the year has ranked in the
bottom half among the airlines reporting on-time statistics, soared
to No. 1 among major air carriers in September with 90.5 percent of
its flights on time.
   America West, largely a regional carrier with its hub in Phoenix,
had the overall best record with nearly 93 percent of it flights on
time. Another Sun Belt regional carrier, Southwest Airlines,
followed Eastern with an 89.3 percent arrival rate.
   Northwest Airlines had the worst record for September with 75.8
percent of its flights arriving on time.
   Among airports, the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport had the best
on-time record with 90.8 percent of its flights arriving within 15
minutes of schedule, followed by Phoenix and Las Vegas, both just
over 89 percent.
   The most arrival delays occurred at Detroit which had a 69
percent on-time record, and St. Louis, 79.6 percent, the department
said.
   Travelers filed 5.71 reports of mishandled baggage per 1,000
passengers in September, down from 7.03 reports in August. The best
previous month had been May, when there were 6.16 reports per 1,000
passengers.
   The DOT, in its monthly Air Travel Consumer Report, also found a
drop in the number of consumer complaints. The 1,370 complaints
reported to DOT in October were 28 percent fewer than the 1,897
recorded in September and 62 percent fewer than the 3,635 registered
in October 1987.
   The department noted that travelers can get information about the
past on-time record of specific flights by checking with airline
ticket offices or travel agents.

<HEAD>Reagan Signs Bill Giving Consumers More Information on Credit Cards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan signed legislation Thursday to
give consumers more and faster information about the costs of credit
cards.
   The bill will require banks, department stores and other credit
card issuers to supply details to their customers about interest
rates and other charges.
   Banking groups worked for passage of the measure because it would
prevent states from imposing differing disclosure requirements on
their interstate industry.
   Consumer groups also backed it strongly.
   The measure calls for card issuers to disclose not only their
interest rates but how the interest charges are calculated and how
long a grace period is allowed before the charges begin to accrue.
   Backers of the legislation said it would enable consumers to shop
around for the lowest interest rates.

<TEXT>
   The sister of Lebanon hostage Terry Anderson
on Thursday rejected President Reagan's allegation that her
brother's recently released videotaped message was written by his
captors.
   ``I know my brother ... a lot better than Ronald Reagan,'' said
Peggy Say. ``There's not a word'' in that message that isn't his,
she said.
   Mrs. Say, speaking to a group of Buffalo State College students,
said she knows her brother's writing style and it is much different
from his captors'.
   ``I have seen communications from the captors and it's not the
same English as his,'' she said.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was kidnapped March 16, 1985, in Beirut by Islamic Jihad, a
Shiite Moslem extremist group backed by Iran.
   In a videotape released Monday, Anderson said he believed the
U.S. government had blocked several attempts to free the nine
American hostages now held in Lebanon.
   Reagan denied that, saying: ``I don't think that was Terry
speaking. ... I think he had a script that was given to him.''
   Mrs. Say criticized Reagan for not doing more to win the release
of the hostages.
   ``I'm getting a double message from the government,'' she said.
Administration responses suggest Anderson's life isn't worth
negotiating for, she contended, despite past negotiations on behalf
of American hostages.
   Mrs. Say said she agrees with the Reagan administration's policy
of not openly negotiating with terrorists. However, the government
has in the past negotiated with terrorists, such as during the
Iran-Contra affair, she said.
   ``I'm being told that Terry's life isn't worth as much as former
hostages'.''
   Although Mrs. Say said Anderson ``looks better than he has at any
other time'' during his captivity, she doesn't think his appearance
means he is being treated any better by his captors.
   ``Terry Anderson is still chained to a basement wall somewhere,''
she said.
   Even so, Mrs. Say said she hopes her brother's improved look
could mean the kidnappers are getting ready to release him.
   ``I'd like to think they are preparing him for release,'' she
said. ``But I know that's a remote chance.''

<TEXT>
   A former firefighter accused of setting a
series of fires that terrorized a small town was indicted Thursday
on 14 counts of arson and two of attempted arson.
   Lance Lalumiere, 23, was arrested Oct. 12 on charges that he set
one of more than 20 fires that plagued Jefferson, a town of 850
people in northern New Hampshire, since May. Lalumiere had been
working as a dishwasher in the town.
   Authorities found a hand-drawn map of several arson sites in
Lalumiere's trailer and a propane torch in a car he owned, according
to court documents released earlier this week.
   A second Jefferson man was charged Oct. 13 with setting one fire
in Dalton, two towns from Jefferson. Though police initially said
firefighter Lawrence Coulter Jr., 19, was a suspect in other fires,
prosecutors said later they consider the Dalton fire an isolated
incident.
   The first fire Lalumiere was charged with setting was to his
brother Michael's cabin in Jefferson in late August.
   There have been no fires since the Oct. 3 fire in Dalton that
Coulter has been charged with setting.
   The attorney general's office said earlier that Lalumiere had
admitted to setting 16 fires.
   Since May 5, 26 fires have been set in the Jefferson area,
causing an estimated $1 million in property damage. The fires began
in brush and fields, but progressed to occupied homes and other
buildings. No one was killed, though there were close calls.
   Attorney General Stephen Merrill said prosecutors did not seek an
indictment Thursday against Coulter from the Coos County grand jury,
but would later.
   Asked if more arrests were expected, he said only, ``I can assure
you we are not going to conclude this matter until we are sure it's
finally resolved.''

<HEAD>Shevardnadze Says Troops Could Go; Few Political Prisoners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some Soviet troops could withdraw within
a year or two after new talks begin on conventional arms reduction
in Europe, the Soviet foreign minister was quoted as saying in a
magazine published Thursday.
   The magazine Hungary also quoted Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the
foreign minister, as saying only 11 political prisoners now are in
Soviet jails and 25 in psychiatric hospitals. He accused Western
nations, who say there are many more, of blocking new human rights
agreements.
   A Soviet proposal for a human rights conference in Moscow in 1991
and Western demands for the release of Soviet political prisoners
have prevented agreement on a final document at a Vienna conference
to review compliance with the 1975 Helsinki agreements on European
security and cooperation.
   Creation of a new forum for East-West talks on reducing
conventional forces from the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural Mountains
depends on a successful resolution of the Vienna conference.
   Shevardnadze said the mandate for the new talks has been
``essentially coordinated'' and the possibility remains of talks
beginning this year.
   ``Within a year or two, we could achieve the first stage of the
reductions, relating to the removal of `imbalances and asymmetries'
between NATO and the Warsaw Pact,'' the foreign minister said.
   He said areas of possible reduction would include Hungary, where
an estimated 65,000 Soviet troops are stationed.
   Hungarian defense officials have said the Red Army soldiers can
be withdrawn only if the North Atlantic Treaty Organization makes
corresponding reductions. Indications have also surfaced that some
Soviet air defense forces might remain in Hungary.
   In the interview, Shevardnadze criticized Western countries he
did not name for blocking agreement in Vienna on a 1991 Moscow human
rights conference.
   ``This is an impermissible and unacceptable tactical approach,''
he said. ``Some of the demands occasionally set by the West are
unrelated to both the actual situation and the essence of the
question concerned.''
   Western nations, notably the United States and Britain, say they
will not go to Moscow for a human rights conference while political
prisoners are held in the Soviet Union.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany said on a visit to Moscow
last week the Soviets gave assurances that all political prisoners
would be free by the end of this year, but some Western governments
were skeptical.
   ``Soviet jurisidiction does not include a `political prisoner'
bracket,'' Shevardnadze said, according to the magazine. ``What is
meant by such in the West is the case of persons condemned under the
code of penal law for activities termed `political' in the West.''
   He said legal bodies in the Soviet Union had reviewed the cases
of several people sentenced under laws now being revised and some
people were released.
   ``At present there are only 11 persons serving such terms and the
revision of cases is continuing,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Another 25 people, he said, were ``called to account before the
law but later declared as psychopaths and sent to psychiatric
hospitals for treatment.''

<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite steady traffic growth, airline safety
indicators showed a significant improvement during the first nine
months of the year compared with the same period last year, the
Transportation Department said Thursday.
   The department said the number of near-collision reports filed by
pilots as well as air traffic controller errors and airline fatal
accident rates all declined markedly during the period compared with
1987.
   Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley said the improved safety
statistics came despite increased air traffic and coincide with
improved on-time performance by the major airlines.
   The department also made public Thursday its latest monthly
airline consumer scorecard which showed the 13 largest airlines have
had on-time records of 80 percent or better during each of the last
six months, including an 85.6 percent on-time arrival mark in
September.
   ``The statistics indicate that our efforts to improve airline
safety and service to consumers are reaping dividends,'' said
Burnley.
   The DOT said the number of near-collision reports from pilots
during the January-September period were 35 percent fewer _ 560
reports _ than filed during the same nine months in l987. The
announcement did not say and it could not be determined Thursday
night how many of the reports involved commercial airliners.
   During nine-month period, there also was a 15 percent decline
nationwide of air traffic controller errors in which aircraft were
allowed to come closer than legally allowed. While a near-collision
incident generally is reported only when planes come within 500
feet, a controller error can occur with aircraft as far as five
miles apart.
   The DOT said there were 808 reports of operational errors by
controllers during the January-September period, compared with 953
during the first nine months of l987.
   But officials acknowledged there were significant exceptions to
the national trend, particularly in the Chicago area, which has some
of the nation's busiest airspace.
   The Federal Aviation Administration recently reduced air traffic
in and out of the Chicago airports, including O'Hare International,
because of a sharp jump in controller errors. O`Hare controllers had
30 flight-handling errors between January and late October, compared
with 12 in all of 1987.
   Meanwhile, Burnley said there were 0.031 fatal accidents per
100,000 flying hours by regularly scheduled airlines during the
January-September period, compared with 0.041 per 100,000 hours in
the same nine months of l987, a decline of 24 percent.

   A mother whose premature baby was stolen
from her hospital room pleaded publicly Thursday that the infant
needed immediate medical attention, and said she had no animosity
for the kidnapper.
   ``If the lady that took my child is listening, watching, I want
you to know that I love my child,'' Annette Jones-Thomas said in her
second public appeal to the woman who impersonated a nurse to take
the baby, Christopher Michael Jones.
   ``Well, let's say that Christopher is your child. What would you
do if your child was sick and needed immediate medical attention?
Would you leave your child at home to suffer, to die? Christopher
needs help now,'' she said.
   Mrs. Jones-Thomas read her statement slowly and deliberately,
appearing slightly nervous but speaking in a strong voice. Doctors
Hospital officials ended the news conference without allowing
reporters to question the mother.
   Rufus Thrower, Mrs. Jones-Thomas' doctor, said she was staying as
calm as possible.
   ``She is a very religious woman, deeply concerned in general
about people and I think it's her love for God and her family that's
kind of keeping her inner strength the way it is,'' Thrower said.
   Mrs. Jones-Thomas, who has two daughters, will be going home in
the next couple of days, Hall said.
   Police Lt. Bert Jenkins said detectives turned up nothing that
would lead them to the kidnapper and baby, who was born six weeks
premature on Saturday.
   The hospital offered a $10,000 reward and three other
organizations put up $1,000 each for the safe return of the child.
   Pediatricians said the boy, who weighed only 4 pounds, needed to
be fed every three hours and must be kept warm. ``If we were very,
very lucky, the baby could do well,'' Dr. Whit Hall said.
``Unfortunately, it could be dead now.''
   The kidnapper, wearing a white pleated skirt and a white sweater,
came into Mrs. Jones-Thomas' fourth-floor hospital room about 10
p.m. Tuesday as the mother was feeding the boy. The woman said she
had to weigh the baby and Mrs. Jones-Thomas gave her the child.
   When a nurse discovered the deception 30 minutes later, police
searched the area with dogs but found nothing.
   Hospital administrator Perry Kinder said he plans to re-evaluate
security, but feels it was adequate and that the kidnapping could
not have been anticipated.
   There was one security guard on duty Tuesday night, and four
hospital entrances were open, officials said.
   Police said they did not know why the Jones baby was taken from
among 28 babies on the same floor at the time of the kidnapping.
   Mrs. Jones-Thomas, 32, a secretary at the Arkansas Education
Association, described the kidnapper as black, about 20 years old,
5-foot-4, 135 pounds with shoulder length black hair.
   The baby was described as black, with long black hair, a large
growth on his right ear lobe and a small growth on his left lobe.

<HEAD>Dukakis Says Voters Taking ``Second Look,'' Bush Defends Views</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS two grafs after 12th pvs, ``America is..., to UPDATE

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis asserted Thursday that voters by the millions are
giving his underdog campaign ``a very strong second look'' in the
waning days of the race for the White House. George Bush said
Democrats were ``grossly unfair'' to say his advertising is tinged
with racism.
   ``You're looking at a man who was out front for civil rights and
I will be again,'' the vice president said in a network television
interview. He defended running mate Dan Quayle on the same score and
said any political wounds would heal quickly after the election.
   Dukakis combined an attack on the Reagan-Bush administration's
record on drugs with ritual declarations that the political tide was
turning in his favor. ``His administration has cut deals with
foreign drug runners. I'm going to cut aid'' to their nations, said
the Democratic nominee.
   Most of the national attention was on the White House campaign,
but not all.
   Democrats were expressing confidence they would control both
houses of the new Congress, although Republicans said they had a
chance of picking up a seat or two in the Senate. A dozen
gubernatorial contests dotted ballots being printed for next
Tuesday's Election Day.
   The public opinion polls in the White House campaign continued to
provide encouragement for Bush.
   Dukakis was trying desperately to reverse poll deficits in
several large Electoral College battlegrounds at once. He ventured
unexpectedly into New Jersey, crooning a la Bruce Springsteen, ``I
was born to run and born to win.'' But Bush, Reagan, Quayle and Co.
were pouring it on in Ohio, where private polls continued to show a
solid Republican edge.
   ABC said its survey of North Carolina _ once Dukakis' strongest
hope for a Southern success _ gave the vice president an 11-point
edge. Dukakis held a four-point margin in a New York survey.
   Bush and Dukakis were spending millions on campaign-closing
television and radio commercials, and both the Democratic and
Republican parties previewed a spate of advertisements designed to
maximize party support.
   Dukakis had an ad featuring one of the most memorable television
moments of the campaign, with Democratic vice presidential candidate
Lloyd Bentsen turning to Quayle during their debate and saying,
``Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.''
   Republicans countered with the Great Communicator.
   ``America is at peace, and we are prosperous once more. ... On
Tuesday, I hope you will vote Republican _ up and down the ticket _
to continue the change we began in 1981,'' said President Reagan in
a 30-second GOP television commercial.
   One ad campaign has drawn the attention of the Justice
Department, which said Thursday it will investigate Democratic
complaints that a Republican ad in South Texas is intimidating
Spanish-speaking voters. The ad, in Spanish, says ``voting officials
will be watching closely'' and warns of penalties for non-citizens
who try to vote.
   In the Seattle area, the Bush campaign pulled much of its
television advertising. A state campaign spokesman said the decision
was made on the national level and represented a shift of spending
to ``targeted products'' such as mailings.
   Newspapers were choosing up sides on their editorial pages _ and
in one case in the comics as well.
   Bob Bryan, owner and publisher of the Cullman Times and Athens
News Courier in Alabama, replaced the comic strip ``Cathy'' with an
advertisement for Bush. Bryan had objected to the comic strip as
being pro-Dukakis, and he said he ``just took the panel out that
would have been Cathy and right where Cathy has been, put in big
type, `Vote for Bush.'''
   Bush and Dukakis both were on morning television programs while
embarking on another dawn-to-dusk dash through key battleground
states.
   In a live 30-minute interview on NBC's ``Today'' show and later
at campaign appearances in Illinois and elsewhere, Bush said any
political wounds would heal in the weeks after the election. ``I
think the country will come together,'' he said. The vice president
also renewed his no-new-taxes pledge.
   Bush heatedly denied that his attacks on Dukakis over the
Massachusetts prison furlough program had racist overtones for
citing the case of Willie Horton Jr., who is black. Horton, a
convicted murderer, brutalized a Maryland couple after escaping, but
Bush said his commercial ``didn't have any reference to his race and
no picture on it.''
   He said Dukakis countered with an ad showing a picture of a
Hispanic prisoner who had escaped from a federal prison program and
committed crimes.
   ``You're looking at a man who is one of compassion, of concern,
and yes, I was out front for civil rights and I will be again,''
Bush said.
   ``And I don't have one ounce of bigotry in my body. Nor does my
running mate,'' he said. Bush added he wanted to ``leave the tired
baggage of bigotry behind us.''
   Dukakis began his 55th birthday in the interview chair at ``CBS
This Morning,'' saying that despite the public polls, the race was
beginning to break his way. He said voters are unhappy with the
Republican campaign, and added, ``That's one of the reasons that
they're taking a very strong second look at me and Mr. Bush, and
seeing some very important differences.''
   A fifth grader in Philadelphia playing Dukakis in a mock debate
received some advice from the man himself. ``Smile frequently and
speak slowly,'' said Dukakis, not known for doing either in his
campaign appearances.
   In an appearance in Fairless Hills, Pa., Dukakis continued his
emphasis on the war on drugs. He outlined a proposal for a $400
million federal contribution for a federal, state and local alliance
to assure drug-free schools across the country by the next decade,
including drug education programs beginning in kindergarten and
community advisory councils to coordinate local efforts.
   Bentsen rode a bus caravan through heavily Democratic East Texas,
sparing no sarcasm in his description of the Republicans. He said
Bush was running his campaign as if on a ``luxury cruise on the
Caribbean'' with the people left behind. As for Quayle, Bentsen said
the Republicans have ``got him like a parrot in a gilded cage.''
   Quayle's day got off to a rocky start when problems with his
chartered ``Hoosier Pride'' campaign jet delayed his departure from
Owensboro, Ky., to South Carolina. While waiting, he told reporters
Bush tapped him for the ticket in part to ``create a little
excitement'' at the GOP convention.

   The FBI has harassed and intimidated
Hispanic agents who successfully sued the bureau for discrimination,
according to documents filed Thursday in federal court.
   Attorneys for the Hispanic agents asked U.S. District Judge
Lucius Bunton to issue an injunction prohibiting the FBI from the
alleged retaliatory acts.
   Their 32-page brief includes affidavits from the lead plaintiff
in the case and two others, all of whom contend they were retaliated
against after Bunton ruled Sept. 30 that the FBI had discriminated
against Hispanics in assignments and promotions.
   The three agents testified in the two-week, non-jury trial in
August. The 311 agents who joined the class action successfully
argued that the FBI assigned them less-desirable jobs, promoted them
too slowly and didn't recognize them for their successes.
   Asked about the allegations of retaliation, FBI spokesman Gregory
Jones in Washington said, ``Our response ... is basically any
intimidation or retaliation would be illegal and intolerable, and
would result in an FBI inquiry.''
   The discrimination suit was filed in January 1987 by Bernardo
``Matt'' Perez, the No. 2 agent in the El Paso office. In an
affidavit filed Thursday, Perez contends that since Bunton's verdict
was announced, ``I have been purposely divorced from many of the
administrative operations of the office, and from my day-to-day
management responsibilities.''
   Perez contends that Richard Schwein, the agent in charge of the
El Paso office, called a meeting the Monday after the verdict was
announced and forbade all the bureau employees from talking about
the discrimination case, on or off duty. Perez also says that on the
same day Schwein called in a Hispanic agent who had talked to
reporters about the case and intimidated him by saying Schwein could
have taken administrative action against him.
   Schwein said Thursday some of Perez's allegations were untrue and
some were the result of misunderstandings.
   ``He (Perez) carries out the day-to-day operations in this
office, and everyone in this office reports to him except me,''
Schwein said.
   Schwein said that at the meeting he told agents, ``This is what
the judge found and this is what we have to deal with.'' He said he
told agents it would be inappropriate to comment publicly about the
case because the second half of the trial concerning damages had not
yet started.
   Schwein said he cautioned the agent who talked to reporters that
he should have made it clear he was speaking as a citizen and not as
a representative of the FBI.
   He said he feels more hurt than anger at Perez's allegations.
   ``I resent having my integrity challenged. I don't like
falsehoods and I consider these falsehoods,'' he said, adding that
he and Perez ``will continue to work together.''
   Perez declined to comment Thursday.
   Fernando Mata, an agent in the Miami office, said in an affidavit
that he believes the FBI is trying to fire him or force him to quit
under the pretext of presenting him as a risk to national security.
   Mata, who testified during the trial that he worked in the FBI's
foreign counterintelligence unit against an unidentified country,
said he has been forced to undergo long interrogations since the
trial. He said in the affidavit that he needs psychiatric help for
``the stress and mental anguish that I feel as a direct result of my
participation in this litigation and the unfounded allegations that
the FBI is making against me.''
   Agent James Garay in Albuquerque said in his affidavit that his
gun and car were taken away from him under the pretext that he had
been injured in an on-the-job car accident. After Garay told his
superiors he intended to file an affidavit with the court, his gun
and driving privileges were restored, according to the document.
   The request for injunction said the agent in charge of the Los
Angeles FBI office requested an administrative inquiry against two
agents who were interviewed for a magazine article detailing
problems in the Los Angeles office.
   ``This action, which is intended to chill that First Amendment
right of class members, was accomplished at an `all employees
conference' in Los Angeles to embarrass and intimidate'' Hispanic
agents who participated in the suit, according to the brief.

<HEAD>Iraq Offers Help In Detecting Chemical Weapons Use</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq, which acknowledged using poison gas
in its war with Iran, is one of 17 nations willing to help
investigate allegations of chemical warfare in the world, according
to a U.N. document released Thursday.
   A report by Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar on chemical
and biological weapons summarizes U.N. efforts to develop ways of
detecting use of such weapons, mainly by coordinating the efforts of
experts in various nations.
   The report to the General Assembly includes the responses of 17
nations that have offered the use of laboratories or experts in
chemical warfare.
   Iraq offered the services of two doctors, two chemists and a
pharmacologist, but said ``it is not possible for Iraqi laboratories
to be used'' in chemical and biological warfare investigations.
   Last summer, Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz answered a
question about alleged chemical warfare in the Persian Gulf war by
responding that Iraq used such weapons only after Iran used them
first.
   Iran says it has the ability to make chemical weapons, but has
never used them.
   Investigations by U.N. experts confirmed that Iraq used chemical
weapons against Iran throughout the war, which began in September

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh agreed
Thursday to investigate a Republican advertising campaign in South
Texas that Democrats claim is intimidating Spanish-speaking voters
with its ``Big Brother'' tone.
   ``We certainly will look into this complaint and to the extent
that there is any evidence that it might be valid, there will be a
harsh response from the federal government,'' said Justice
Department spokesman Loye Miller.
   Miller said the U.S. attorney in charge of the Lower Rio Grande
Valley would be contacted Friday and asked to ``take a look at the
whole situation.''
   Democratic Rep. Jack Brooks accused Texas Republicans Thursday of
using Spanish-language radio advertising to keep voters from going
to the polls next Tuesday in the heavily Hispanic border area by
``injecting an element of fear.''
   Brooks asked Thornburgh to determine if Republican Party
officials in Hidalgo County are violating federal voting rights laws
by running radio ads citing penalties for non-citizens who vote and
that twice remind listeners that election officials ``will be
watching.''
   Republican officials defend the ads as proper and say they are
not an attempt at intimidation.
   ``I would hope that any law enforcement agency spending time in
South Texas concentrates on trying to stamp out the voter fraud we
have seen in that region for the past 20 years _ voter fraud
perpetrated by the Democrats,'' said Mark Sanders, a spokesman for
the Texas campaign of Republican presidential nominee George Bush.
   Brooks, who is in line to become chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, told Thornburgh in a letter: ``It should be clear that
this advertising campaign, accompanied by the repeated `Big Brother'
warning that `election officials are watching,' was not motivated by
the benign goal of discouraging illegal voting, but rather is an
obvious attempt to hold down overall voter turnout among
Spanish-speaking citizens by injecting an element of fear into the
voting process.''
   The Beaumont congressman said he believes the advertising could
be a violation of federal voting rights laws, which prohibit
intimidation or coercion in the exercise of the right to vote.
   Sanders said the ad is running in in Hidalgo County because ``we
don't want to see graveyard votes, Alice in Wonderland votes, and
votes from the precincts of outer Mongolia.''
   The Spanish language ad says: ``Voting officials will be watching
closely. It is illegal to vote in this election if you are not a
U.S. citizen. If you have a green card you cannot vote. If you do
you can be subject to up to 10 years in prison, fined up to $5,000
and lose your opportunity to become a U.S. citizen. If you accept
money to vote you can get up to five years in jail. Remember,
election officials are watching. Paid for by the Republican Party of
Hidalgo County, Don Winngate, director.''

<HEAD>General Assembly Condemns Israel For Abusing Palestinian Human
Rights</HEAD>

   The General Assembly overwhelmingly
condemned Israel Thursday for killings, woundings, beatings,
deportations and other allegations of violating the human rights of
Palestinans in the occupied territories.
   The vote was 130-2, with 16 abstentions.
   The United States and Israel voted against. Britain and Canada
abstained.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization opened the debate Thursday
by accusing Israel of murdering 411 Palestinian civilians since an
anti-Israeli insurrection began in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip 11 months ago.
   Every year, the assembly by a lopsided vote condemns Israeli
human rights practices in the occupied lands, captured from Arab
foes in the 1967 Mideast war.
   U.S. Ambassador Herbert S. Okun, the deputy permanent
representative, criticized the ``divisive'' resolution and said it
``hinders the search for peace in the region.
   ``It is an unbalanced document, condemning one of the parties for
its actions without taking into account acts of violence by the
other side. The harsh rhetoric in this resolution can only inflame
an already embittered situation, making it more difficult to proceed
toward a negotiated settlement,'' he said.
   Okun said U.S. policy calls for a negotiated settlement which
``will require an exchange of territory for peace. ... (Israel's)
security ... must be assured. At the same time, the legitimate
political rights of the Palestinian people must be recognized.''
   The resolution said the assembly ``condemns Israel's persistent
policies and practices violating the human rights of the Palestinian
people in the occupied territories, including Jerusalem.''
   It cited fatal shootings and woundings by the Israeli army and
settlers of ``defenseless Palestinian civilians, the beating and
breaking of bones, deportation, imposition of restrictive economic
measures, demolition of houses, collective punishment and
detentions, as well as denial of access to the media.''
   It ``demands that Israel, the occupying power, abide immediately
and scrupulously'' by the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention on
protecting civilians in time of war and halt all violations of that
convention.
   Israel told the assembly the United Nations was being
``hijacked'' by some Arab nations in a counterproductive debate on
the territories which ``incites and encourages violence'' and blocks
peace agreements. Israel said it would continue efforts to restore
order and would exercise ``maximum restraint.''
   The Israeli ambassador, Johanan Bein, condemned what he called
Palestinian inhumanity in burning familes alive by firebombs,
planting bombs in civilian buses and throwing grenades at sidewalk
cafes and toy shops full of children.
   M. Nasser al-Kidwa, PLO deputy U.N. representative, told the
General Assembly that 411 civilians, including 60 women, were killed
and 4,500 wounded from Dec. 8, 1987, when the insurrection began, to
Oct. 30.
   Other estimates put the toll at more than 300 Palestinians and 10
Israelis.
   An additional 11,400 Palestinians from the 1.5 million
Palestinian population were detained without trial, he charged.
   Kidwa said that besides shootings, beatings, use of plastic
bullets and of tear gas, and the like, Israeli soldiers tried to
bury some Palestinians alive. He said some pregnant women lost their
unborn babies as a result of beatings or inhaling tear gas.
   The 143-page U.N. report by Daya R. Perera, ambassador of Sri
Lanka, said: ``The report reflects the dramatic deterioration of the
human rights situation in the occupied territories since the
beginning of the uprising.''
   The report covered the period from Sept. 4, 1987, to last Aug. 26.
   The document said Israel's occupation of the territories itself
is a violation of human rights.
   The report said that ``while several thousands of civilians have
been physically injured, the entire Palestinian population has
suffered from the Israeli policy of `force, power and blows''' and
of the ``iron fist.''
   It said in the long run, protection can only be ensured through
negotiation of a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement of the
Arab-Israeli conflict.

<TEXT>
   A strong earthquake in northwest
Puerto Rico rippled across the Caribbean island, shaking buildings
and sending people running into the streets. No damage or injuries
were reported.
   An aftershock measuring 4 on the Richter scale followed the
quake, which measured 5.7, said William MacCann, director of the
University of Puerto Rico's Seismological Network.
   McCann said the 3:42 p.m. earthquake was the strongest in Puerto
Rico since 1979, when a temblor of magnitude 5.9 shook the island.
   He said the quake's epicenter was in the Atlantic Ocean off the
northwestern port city of Aguadilla, 80 miles west of San Juan. But
the tremor was felt throughout the island, which is 100 miles long
and 35 miles wide.
   In San Juan, where about one-third of the island's 3.2 million
people live, the tremor swayed some buildings and was felt for five
seconds. Puerto Rico is a U.S. commonwealth 1,100 miles southeast of
Florida.
   Anibal Roman, director for Civil Defense northwestern Puerto
Rico, said there were no reports of damage or injuries.
   A police official in Aguadilla said a housing project in the city
was evacuated and people ran yelling into the street.
   Last week, five earthquakes centered on an inactive volcano
struck the Caribbean island of St. Kitts, but caused no damage or
injuries.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion released on a
seismograph.
   A quake of magnitude 4 can cause moderate damage. At magnitude 5,
it can cause considerable damage.

<HEAD>Bentsen Sees `Awfully Short' Bush Honeymoon With Congress</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Lloyd Bentsen said Thursday that if
Republican George Bush is elected president, his honeymoon with
Congress would be ``awfully short'' because of resentments stemming
from Bush's negative campaign tactics.
   ``I don't see how ... a president has any kind of a mandate if he
wins by the amount of negative advertising'' used by Bush, the
Democratic vice presidential candidate told reporters on a campaign
bus tour of East Texas.
   The Texas senator said he does not want a difficult relationship
with any new Republican administration, but that the ``concentration
on negative advertising, that doesn't become a mandate to the
American people.''
   ``That makes it more difficult,'' Bentsen said. ``You don't have
any so-called honeymoon. It would be an awfully short one, if you
had that.''
   Bentsen, who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said
Bush as president might have particular trouble persuading Congress
to accept his campaign promise of a reduction in the top-bracket
capital gains tax rate from 33 percent to 15 percent.
   Bentsen said the proposal would benefit mostly the wealthy and
was regarded as a violation of the agreement behind the 1986 tax
overhaul law.
   Bentsen was interviewed in the lounge of a luxury bus he used
Thursday to stump for middle-class votes in the rural area of Texas
near the Louisiana and Arkansas borders.
   Two other buses and a few cars and pickup trucks chased the
candidate's vehicle through Longview, Daingerfield, Mount Pleasant,
Paris and Sulphur Springs. East Texas is rich in pro-Reagan
Democrats that party nominee Michael Dukakis must win in his bid for
the state's 29 electoral votes in Tuesday's balloting.
   ``I'm fighting for middle-income America and I'm standing up for
middle-income America,'' Bentsen told several hundred supporters in
Longview.
   ``When I'm vice president of the United States, and Michael
Dukakis is president of the United States, we'll meet with the press
on a regular basis,'' he said.
   ``And there's something else we'll do. We'll meet with the folks,
we'll meet with middle-income America,'' he said.
   ``That's the kind of accountability you want from your elected
representatives,'' he said, stressing the Democrats' accessibility
to voters and the media.
   By contrast, his GOP counterpart, Dan Quayle, is kept under
control ``like a parrot in a gilded cage,'' Bentsen said.
   Mike McCurry, Bentsen's press secretary, said the Democratic
campaign is releasing a new TV advertisement this weekend which
features Bentsen's widely publicized ``You're no Jack Kennedy'' barb
at Quayle during their mid-October debate.
   The spot ends with the words: ``President Quayle?'' he said.
   After his bus tour, Bentsen helicoptered into Dallas for a live
appearance on public television's MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour, where he
said the main reason the Repulicans were leading in the polls was
their negative advertising.
   ``They've painted Michael Dukakis for something he isn't,''
Bentsen said, citing the criticism on gun control and the furlough
of Massachusetts prisoner Willie Horton, a convicted murderer who
brutalized a Maryland couple while on a weekend pass. Republican ads
has contended that Dukakis wanted to take away sportsmen's guns and
was soft on crime and that was not true, Bentsen said.
   He also reaffirmed his belief that there was a racist element in
the Republican use of the Horton case,
   But Bentsen said he felt the Democratic message was getting
through and there was still time to turn around the polls.
   ``I've been more encouraged in the last four days than I've been
in the last three months,'' he said.
   Among Bentsen's frequent stops Thursday was a visit to a
Daingerfield cafe for coffee and donuts.
   His bus had a special window installed so he could wave to
constituents. The vehicle, which belongs to a wealthy Texan who uses
it for family skiing trips, was not equipped with windows that open.
   Helping Bentsen draw crowds along the route were country music
singer Gary Morris and Hollywood actor Rob Lowe, who drew squeals
from young girls everywhere the caravan went.

<HEAD>General Says Military Launching Total Offensive Against Rebels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military is launching an offensive to
wipe out Colombia's leftist guerrillas, the country's top general
said Thursday.
   ``The subversives want a military response and we are going to
give it to them,'' Defense Minister Gen. Rafael Samudio Molina said
at a funeral for 11 soldiers killed in a guerrilla ambush Tuesday.
   ``As commander of the armed forces I exhort every single soldier
in a total offensive to destroy the enemy, eliminate him, wipe out
his will to fight,'' Samudio said.
   There are an estimated 10,000 leftist guerrillas in Colombia,
whose population of 30 million. More than 75,000 people have been
killed in 15 years of insurrection.
   Colombia's armed forces have held back from an all-out war
against the guerrillas during off-and-on peace talks between the
government and the rebels over the last six years.
   The army recently bought eight Blackhawk army helicopter gunships
from the United States for its anti-guerrilla forces.
   Samudio, apparently speaking with the support of President
Virgilio Barco, said there was no use trying to negotiate with the
guerrillas.
   The guerrillas rejected a peace plan proposed last month by
Barco, who offered pardons to all guerrillas who would surrender and
said he would let rebel leaders address Congress on changes that
should be made in Colombia.
   Barco's predecessor, President Belisario Betancur, launched peace
talks with the guerrillas in 1982. The talks collapsed amid mutual
accusations by the rebels and the military of cease-fire violations.
   In 50 separate actions last month, rebels raided towns and
military bases, ambushed army patrols and blew up bridges and high
tension electricity towers.
   By Defense Ministry count, 56 soldiers and policemen, 26
civilians and 123 rebels were killed.

   A human rights organization, challenging
statements by Soviet officials that they are holding fewer than a
dozen political prisoners, on Thursday released a list of 156
Soviets it said were jailed for their religious beliefs.
   Although the Soviet Union has liberalized its human rights
policies in recent years, it remains officially an atheist state and
some religious believers say they are persecuted because their faith
is seen as a challenge to authority.
   Debi Mulligan, spokeswoman for the Puebla Institute, a
Washington-based lay Roman Catholic organization, said ``nearly
every Soviet religious group, with the exception of the Jewish
religion, can claim at least one prisoner for religious reasons.''
   ``Prisoners include Baptists, Ukrainian Catholics, Moslems,
Jehovah's Witnesses, Russian Orthodox, Pentecostals, Lithuanian
Catholics, Hare Krishna's and Seven Day Adventists,'' she said,
reading a prepared statement.
   ``Their crimes range from processing or printing religious
literature, to worshiping in a church or with a congregation that is
not state-approved, to manufacturing religious articles, to
protesting government interference in the church,'' the statement
said. Some people, including a number of Moslems, have been jailed
for giving religious instruction to children, she said.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass on Monday quoted Soviet
Justice Minister Boris Kravtsov as saying there were eight political
prisoners _ five imprisoned and two in internal exile under an
anti-agitation law and another incarcerated for anti-Soviet slander.
   Tass also quoted Kravtsov as indicating, although not specifying,
that the Soviet government planned to drop criminal code Article
190, which bans ``anti-Soviet slander,'' and has been used against
dissidents.
   Kravtsov said another law used against dissidents, Article 70,
which bans ``anti-Soviet slander,'' would be used ``only for
concrete actions that would be manifested, say, in calls for
overthrow of power, of the government.''
   The comments by Kravtsov and other Soviet officials were
challenged immediately by Soviet and Western human rights activists.
   Andrei D. Sakharov, winner of the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize, told
reporters that 25 people were being held in labor camps under the
anti-slander article. Sakharov was banished to the city of Gorky for
seven years, without any charges being brought against him, before
his release two years ago.
   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights
organization, has said it has information on 150 Soviets
``imprisoned solely for the non-violent exercise of their
fundamental human rights.''
   The Puebla spokeswoman said the Puebla and Amnesty lists
overlapped. She said that although no Jewish religious prisoners
were being held, many Jews had problems emigrating from the Soviet
Union and five Jews had been released this year after serving
sentences on anti-slander or related charges.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said after talks with Kremlin
officials in Moscow last week that he was told that all Soviets that
the West regards as political prisoners would be released by the end
of the year.
   In Moscow on Thursday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.
Gerasimov said Soviet criminal law will be revised by the end of the
year and then ``there will be no basis to speak about political
prisoners.''
   He would not state clearly, however, if all laws used to
prosecute people for their political beliefs would be repealed.
   Nor would he say whether all current political prisoners will be
freed.
   Gerasimov said that as of Thursday, only 11 people still were
being held under the four laws involved in Western complaints. There
are another 25 ``insane people not condemned because they were sent
for compulsory medical treatment.''
   Of the 11, he said two people are incarcerated under Article 227,
which bans criminal offenses under the pretext of practicing
religion.

   Sen. Dan Quayle said Thursday that George
Bush picked him for the second spot on the Republican ticket at
least in part to ``create a little excitement'' at the GOP
convention.
   Grounded temporarily at the Owensboro airport while mechanics
replaced an auxiiary power unit on his campaign plane, Quayle,
standing in the lobby of the hangar, reflected on his campaign
experience.
   He said his reception by crowds at campaign rallies had given him
``a lot of exhilaration.'' On the other hand, he said, ``I guess my
biggest disappointment'' was what he called the ``totally unfair''
initial news media coverage of his candidacy.
   ``I'm willing to let bygones be bygones,'' he said. But Quayle
added that when the campaign is over, ``it's going to be a very
interesting discussion that you all are going to have about
yourselves.''
   If he could change anything about the campaign, Quayle said, he
would have skipped the post-New Orleans convention week in which he
was hit with ``harsh personal attacks ... about what I did 20 years
ago.''
   Quayle was faced with questions about the circumstances under
which he signed up for an Indiana National Guard unit in 1969,
during the Vietnam war, and about how he got admitted to the law
school with what basically was a ``C'' transcript from high school.
He has denied repeatedly that any improper influence was used in
either instance.
   On Thursday, Quayle acknowledged that he was mostly an unknown
commodity when Bush announced his selection on Aug. 16, the second
day of the GOP convention in New Orleans, and he said that the press
had a duty to scrutinize him.
   ``What he (Bush) wanted to do was create a little excitement at
the Republican convention,'' Quayle said.
   He grimaced when asked if that was the principal reason Bush
chose him, saying, ``no, also for my qualifications, experience and
so forth.''
   Quayle also referred to the close supervision and handling he got
from representatives of the Bush campaign in the weeks immediately
following the New Orleans convention.
   ``I never like to Monday morning quarterback,'' he said, ``I
would have made the change of not having a a controlled environment
earlier. But that was a decision I had to make myself.''
   Quayle, who told reporters several weeks ago that he was
declaring his independence from such tight control, also said
Thursday, however, he recognized a need for special handling
initially ``because I didn't know the ground rules'' of running a
national campaign.
   In a speech prepared later at a rally attended by more than 4,000
people on the campus of Oklahoma State University, Quayle said that
Michael Dukakis' tough position on drugs ``rings hollow.''
   He said that ``Mr. Dukakis is coming out with a lot of tough talk
about a war on drugs.'' Then, Quayle quoted Massachusetts Attorney
General James Shannon, a Democrat, as saying five months ago:
``We're losing the war on drugs in the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts.''
   Quayle aides said that Mitchell had made the statement in a June
10 article in The New York Times.
   ``If Mr. Dukakis can't fight drugs effectively in his own
backyard, how can he make claims to do so for America,'' the senator
asked.
   Shannon issued a statement through the Dukakis campaign, saying:
``The reason we have a drug problem in Massachusetts and 49 other
states is because George Bush blew the one job Ronald Reagan gave
him, and that was to spearhead the administration's war on drugs.
   ``While Gov. Dukakis led the nation in bringing early drug
education into the schools and spending more money on drug
enforcement, George Bush was asleep at the wheel.''
   In Kentucky, Quayle, his aides, Secret Service agents and the
traveling press corps spent more than three hours at the terminal
before boarding the Boeing 727 for the flight to South Carolina.
   At one point, the senator, accompanied by a small group of
reporters, was driven to the Town Square Mall in Owensboro and to
Thornbury's toy store to shop for his son Benjamin, who turns 12
Saturday.
   Quayle visited with employees while he shopped, exclaimed ``this
is Reaganomics at work'' when he spotted a toy on sale and paid his
$51.42 bill with a credit card.

<TEXT>
   Up to a foot of snow fell Thursday at the south entrance of
Yellowstone National Park and strong winds hit Colorado, Wyoming and
the northern coast of New England, but the southern Plains and Texas
were warm.
   Snow advisories were in place Thursday over the higher elevations
of the Washington Cascades, with a snowfall of 6 inches at Chinook
Pass and 7 inches at Washington Pass.
   In Yellowstone, 2 inches of snow covered southern portions and
the Snowy Range Ski Area, and 8 to 12 inches fell near the south
entrance. In New Hampshire, 4 inches fell at Mount Washington.
   High wind warnings were posted over southeast Wyoming and parts
of Colorado, where gusts were expected to reach 70 or 80 mph, the
National Weather Service said. Morning winds were recorded at 57 mph
at Boulder and 54 mph at the Air Force Academy. In Wyoming, winds
gusted to 62 mph at Washoe Valley and to 78 mph in the nearby
mountains.
   A wind advisory was posted over the mountains of northern
California Thursday afternoon and night. Warnings of gale force
winds remained Thursday night along the northern coast of New
England.
   Temperatures through the southern Plains remained warm, and
Abilene, Texas, tied a high temperature record for the date set in
1897 with an 84 degree reading. San Angelo, Texas, set a new record
with 86 degrees, breaking the former record of 85 degrees in 1915.
   The low in the nation early Thursday was 16 degrees at Alamosa,
Colo.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 32
degrees at Saranac Lake, N.Y., to 86 degrees at Fort Meyers, Fla.
   For Friday, the forecast called for widespread showers and
occasional thunderstorms extending from Louisiana to the Florida
Panhandle and over most of the Appalachians, the Tennessee and Ohio
valleys, Illinois and eastern Missouri.
   Showers are expected to reach from eastern North Dakota across
the Great Lakes to New Jersey, New York and southern New England.
Rain showers also are forecast from western Montana across Idaho and
Washington, changing to snow in the higher elevations.
   Winds will be strong and gusty over the Rockies and the Texas
panhandle. Temperatures will reach the 40s and 50s over northern and
central New England, the upper Great Lakes and from the upper
Mississippi Valley across the northern Rockies and Washington.
   Highs will be in the 80s over much of the Florida peninsula, much
of Louisiana and from much of Texas across southeast Arizona. Highs
will be in the 80s and low 90s over the desert Southwest. High
temperatures over the remainder of the nation will generally reach
the 60s and 70s.

<TEXT>
   President Augusto Pinochet reshuffled the
highest ranks of his army on Thursday, sending a dozen generals into
retirement.
   An army communique listed among the 12 Lt. Gen. Santiago
Sinclair, deputy commander-in-chief and considered a staunch
supporter of Pinochet.
   Pinochet, the army commander-in-chief, named Maj. Gen. Jorge
Zincke as deputy, the man who handles the day-to-day business in the
service while Pinochet devotes most of his time to the presidency.
   As commander of Santiago garrison, Zincke was widely credited
with mantaining order during the Oct. 5 referendum, when voters
rejected a proposal by the military that Pinochet extend his 15
years in power until 1997. Zincke's performance that day drew praise
even from some opposition leaders.
   Zincke is considered less a hardliner than his predecessor,
Sinclair, who was noted by his fervent personal loyalty to Pinochet.
   The highly disciplined army has been considered the backbone of
Pinochet's power since he led the military in a 1973 coup.
   The communique said four of the generals had reached mandatory
retirement with 40 years in service. Pinochet retired the other
eight because of undisclosed ``institutional reasons'' as part of an
annual process, it said.
   Pinochet used special legislation to let Gen. Sergio Badiola, a
close friend and Santiago governor, stay in the army despite
reaching retirement age. Among those retired for ``institutional
reasons'' was Gen. Ernesto Videla, who has been a deputy foreign
minister for years and is considered a highly popular officer among
his peers and among many civilian politicians.
   Pinochet also promoted 10 brigadiers to the rank of general.
   Pinochet personally announced the changes to the entire generals
corps during a luncheon at the Presidential Palace.

<HEAD>Health Officials Try to Stem Whooping Cough Outbreak</HEAD>

   Nurses went door-to-door in a small Amish
community in this western New York town in an effort to contain an
outbreak of whooping cough.
   The number of confirmed cases rose Wednesday from six to 11, with
at least 20 other children showing whooping cough symptoms, said
Mary Anne Power, supervising health nurse for Cattaraugus County.
   In 1982, a similar outbreak in the same community, located about
45 miles south of Buffalo, lasted three months and affected more
than 200 children.
   ``We've got to do something now or it is going to get out of
hand,'' said Dr. Dana Anderson.
   The nurses are trying to promote immunizations, encourage sick
children to get treatment and urge parents of children with whooping
cough to keep their children out of the Amish-run schools for three
weeks, said county health Commissioner Dr. James Garvey.
   The outbreak has attracted more attention since the death Monday
of 3{-month-old Isaac Shetler of Conewango, the first person to die
of whooping cough in the United States since 1985, federal health
officials said.
   Word of his death passed through the scattered Amish farms
Tuesday, which brought concerned Amish mothers to the clinic on
Wednesday seeking medicine for their babies.
   Health officials fear the medicine may not be enough to prevent
the further spread of the disease among the Amish because of their
reluctance to immunize their children.
   Whooping cough, or pertussis, is a respiratory disease that
causes a chronic cough, vomiting and the characteristic ``whooping''
noise when those afflicted gasp for air.
   To adults it's usually no more threatening than a common cold,
but to infants and small children it can be life-threatening,
federal health officials said.
   Most American children receive a series of ``DPT'' immunizations
that protect them from diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus. The
immunization is required in New York for children attending public
schools unless there are extenuating health or religious reasons.
   The Amish, who shun modern customs and technology, only
half-heartedly are accepting treatment, health officials said, and
would rather deal with this problem themselves.
   One Amish man, with a long, uneven red beard under a
broad-brimmed black hat and wearing denim work clothes, talked about
the problem.
   ``It's like they're looking down on us because our kids've got
the whooping cough. Like we're the poor, dirty Amish who don't take
care of our children. Like we're being mean to our kids,'' the man
said.
   ``Well, we have got the whooping cough, but they have got drugs
and people shooting each other in the street,'' he said. He did not
give his name.
   His brother-in-law agrees.
   ``Only the good Lord knows why a child dies. If the good Lord
wants my child to die a natural death, it's better than dying of
drug abuse. Our way works for us, and it's a free world, isn't it?''

<HEAD>NRA, Black Establishment Clash Over Gun Referendum</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maryland's urban black precincts are shaping up
as the crucial battleground in the final days of a bitter referendum
fight over the state's pioneering handgun law.
   The importance of the black areas was underscored Thursday when
Jesse Jackson gave a passionate endorsement of the law in a rally at
predominately black Morgan State University.
   Before the rally, Jackson told WBAL Radio, ``I support people
having guns on reservations to hunt game. I support people having
the right to guns in their houses, but not to have guns to hunt
other people. ... I say let's stop the guns and stop the drugs and
let's go another way.''
   The 6-month-old law, designed to outlaw cheap pistols known as
Saturday Night Specials, creates a nine-member board with authority
to outlaw the sale and manufacture of handguns it deems don't have
legitimate uses for recreation or personal security.
   The Jackson appearance was an attempt to undercut the strategy
pro-gun forces hope will result in the law's repeal next Tuesday:
win big in the state's rural areas, break even in the white suburbs
and keep the margin down in black precincts.
   According to a Mason-Dixon poll conducted Oct. 29-30, blacks, who
are 22 percent of the Maryland electorate, support the law 55
percent to 29 percent with 16 percent still undecided. No margin of
error was given for that part of the poll because the sampling was
small.
   Overall, Marylanders favor the law approximately 48 percent to 44
percent with 9 percent undecided, according to the poll. The poll's
overall margin of error was 3.5 percentage points.
   Advocates of repeal argue the law would open the door to
banishment of all handguns. That message is being given to black
voters, along with the argument the law discriminates against the
poor because it would make inexpensive weapons unavailable.
   The law's suporters counter by noting that guns are the leading
cause of death among young black men in Maryland and insisting it
will make the streets of their communities safer.
   The law's opponents acknowledge that their cause has been damaged
by an inability to garner the support of high-profile black leaders,
a fact they blame on pressure from the white political establishment.
   ``If we had had an even break in terms of power structure
endorsements, we would have been over the top already,'' said George
Young, a California political consultant who is directing the repeal
effort.
   ``There is a linkage between black politicians and white liberals
having to do with political fund raising ... and to the extent
(black) people are philosophically or economically committed to
being friends with the liberal structure, they just can't afford to
take a stand against this structure,'' Young said.
   That analysis infuriated James Abraham, who is leading the
pro-law campaign in black areas.
   ``That's racist, really. It infers we don't have any political
integrity. It's nasty and I don't like it,'' Abraham said.
   Abraham, in turn, charged the pro-gun forces with trying to buy
the votes of blacks by hiring blacks to do door-to-door canvassing.

<HEAD>Dominicans Flock To Parade Celebrating Independence From Britain</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of Dominicans flocked to the
capital Thursday and climbed rooftops, trees and walls to get a good
view of marching bands at a military parade on the 10th anniversary
of independence from Britain.
   Hundreds of foreign dignitaries, including Prime Minister Lynden
Pindling of the Bahamas, took part in the day's festivities.
Military bands from the U.S., Britain, Scotland, France and
Venezuela took part in the afternoon parade.
   Prime Minister Eugenia Charles, the Caribbean's first woman prime
minister, delivered an emotional Independence Day speech before a
crowd of 8,000 people. Often interrupted by applause, the prime
minister pledged to improve social and environmental conditions.
   ``I declare 1989 the year of housing and the environment,'' said
the prime minister.
   Ms. Charles vowed to continue her fight against government
corruption and spoke loudly as she pronounced: ``You, the majority
of Dominicans have said `dealers, dealers' are gone. No matter how
vocal they become and no matter what costume they wear, the greedy
and lazy will not be allowed to plunder the public purse again.''
   The parade also featured contingents from Dominica's police
force. This nation of 100,000 people has no army, navy or air force.
   The anniversary observance began with church services throughout
the island, the largest and most northern of the Windward Islands,
with Guadeloupe to the north and Martinique to the south.
   During a morning service at the Roman Catholic Cathedral in
Roseau, the capital, Bishop Arnold Bogheart said a theme for the day
should be solidarity, including ``some form of meaningful unitary
status'' among the seven English-speaking nations of the
Organization of Eastern Caribbean States.
   The island states have been attempting to form a political union
ever since the breakup of the West Indies Federation 30 years ago.
   Dominica, which has had a stormy political past and is one of the
least developed countries in the Caribbean, is undergoing a major
economic reconstruction in a period of political stability.
   The island gained independence from Britain on Nov. 3, 1978, and
almost immediately plunged into disorder after the former Dominica
Labor Party government of Prime Minister Patrick John was implicated
in an unsuccessful invasion of Barbados led by mercenaries.
   John was ousted amid popular disturbances in May 1979, and Oliver
Seraphine formed an interim government. But Seraphine's government
also was beset by scandals.
   Shortly after the election of Ms. Charles and her Dominica
Freedom Party in July 1980, the country went through a period of
kidnappings, murders and three unsuccessful coup attempts, one of
which resulted in the arrest of U.S. and Canadian mercenaries
allegedly tied to the Ku Klux Klan.
   In addition to political problems, the young nation has been hit
by a series of hurricanes, including one in 1979 that destroyed 60
percent of its crops and devastated transportation and
communications.
   The 69-year-old Ms. Charles, a conservative who was elected to a
second five-year term in July 1985, was a leading proponent of the
U.S.-led invasion of Grenada in October 1983.
   Most of Dominica's inhabitants are descendants of African slaves
imported by planters in the 18th century. English is the official
language, but most Dominicans speak a French-based creole,
reflecting the country's French colonial heritage.

<HEAD>Draft Decree Says Government-Appointed Board Will Run Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Radio stations on Thursday announced
the contents of a draft decree proposed by Haiti's military rulers,
which says a government-appointed Electoral College will run
elections and write an electoral law.
   The draft decree said the Electoral Board, made up of nine
government-appointed representatives, one from each of Haiti's
provinces, will also control voter registration and arbitrate
disputes between candidates, Radio Haiti Inter said.
   The decree bears the names of Haitian ruler Lt. Gen. Prosper
Avril and all 12 Cabinet ministers, the station said.
   ``The draft project is quite simply anti-constitutional; a scheme
to get around the constitution,'' said Dr. Louis Roy, co-author of
the constitution massively approved by Haitians in a 1987 referendum.
   The 1987 constitution, considered the most liberal in Haiti's
184-year history, provides for an independent electoral council,
appointed by institutions such as the Roman Catholic Church, human
rights groups and journalists associations.
   ``It is not possible to restore the constitution by
anti-constitutional means. In Avril's version of the electoral
institution, the executive names the members, and deprives it
thereby of its independence,'' Roy said.
   After he was appointed president by soldiers who ousted Lt. Gen.
Henri Namphy on Sept. 17, Avril promised to respect the
constitution, human rights, and return Haiti to democracy.
   Avril told opposition politicians that elections could not be
held for at least another two years.
   The government delivered copies of the draft decree to several
radio stations, political parties and professional groups in
Port-au-Prince, asking for comments and suggestions, which may be
incorporated into the decree before it is made into law by the
military government, Radio Haiti Inter said.
   Namphy had suspended the constitution, saying it was inspired by
foreign ideas.
   Soldiers said they ousted Namphy because they were sickened by
unpunished acts of terrorism and state-sponsored violence.
   Namphy abolished the independent Electoral Council on Nov. 29
hours after thugs protected by soldiers shot and hacked to death at
least 36 voters, in what would have been Haiti's first truly free
election.
   An attempt by Namphy to override the independent council and
rewrite the electoral law in June 1987 touched off a wave of
anti-government protests and strikes, which left over 30 dead and
dozens wounded.
   Namphy replaced dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier, who fled to France
in February 1986.

   A man whose murder conviction in the slaying of a
Dallas police officer drew national attention because of questions
raised in the documentary movie ``The Thin Blue Line'' has a chance
at a new trial.
   State District Judge Larry Baraka on Wednesday agreed to hear
arguments from attorneys that new evidence, some of which was
allegedly suppressed during his original trial, proves Randall Dale
Adams did not kill the Dallas officer.
   ``I felt there was a sufficient amount of issues raised to cause
the court concern enough to look into it,'' Baraka said.
   After hearing evidence Nov. 30, Baraka will tell the Texas Court
of Criminal Appeals whether he believes Adams deserves a new trial.
The appeals court is the only Texas court that has the power to
grant such a trial.
   In 1977, Adams was convicted of killing officer Robert Wood, who
was shot to death on a nearly deserted street Nov. 28, 1976.
   Adams' attorney, Randy Schaffer, contends that Adams is innocent
and that the real killer was David Ray Harris, the state's key
witness against him. In statements to newspapers and in the movie
``The Thin Blue Line,'' Harris has said Adams is innocent.
   Harris is on Death Row for a different killing.
   Dallas County District Attorney John Vance said his office would
contest the motion and dismissed Harris' statements, saying he is
simply seeking publicity.
   Adams originally was sentenced to death, but Gov. Bill Clements
in 1979 commuted his term to life.

   Cinematographer George Folsey, who
was nominated for 13 Academy Awards during a career that spanned 50
years, has died after a stroke and long illness. He was 90.
   Folsey died Tuesday at St. John's Hospital.
   He was best known for his collaborations with directors Vincente
Minelli, George Cukor, Frank Capra, Ernst Lubitsch, Rouben Mamoulian
and Busby Berkeley.
   Among the films Folsey shot were the Marx Brothers' ``Animal
Crackers,'' Capra's ``State of the Union,'' Minelli's ``Meet Me in
St. Louis'' and the television series ``The Fugitive.''
   In 1976, he returned to motion pictures to film special footage
of Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly for ``That's Entertainment, Part 2.''
   His Oscar nominations included ``Executive Suite,'' ``Seven
Brides for Seven Brothers'' and ``The Balcony.'' He also served as
president of the American Society of Cinematographers in the late
1950s.
   He is survived by his wife of 61 years, Angele; a son George Jr.,
a producer-editor who was acquitted in last year's ``Twilight Zone''
involuntary manslaughter trial; and two grandchildren.
   A mass and burial is set for 10:30 a.m. Saturday at St. Paul the
Apostle Church in Westwood. A wake is scheduled Friday at 7:30 p.m.
at the Santa Monica funeral home of Gates Kingsley & Gates.

   Belfast playwright Stewart
Parker, has died in a London hospital of bone cancer at the age of
47, the Northern Ireland Arts Council said Thursday.
   Malcolm Longley, the council's literature director, said Parker
died Wednesday. He described him as a ``visionary in the theater''
and ``irreplaceable.''
   Parker's first important play, ``Spokesong,'' first performed in
Dublin, told the history of the bicycle as a way of illustrating the
history of Irish conflict and won him a London award as most
promising playwright of 1976.
   Other acclaimed plays were ``Northern Star'' and ``Pentecost,''
both dealing with the conflict between Protestants and Roman
Catholics in Northern Ireland, and a TV drama, ``I'm A Dreamer,
Montreal.''
   Parker was born in working-class Protestant east Belfast and once
said: ``You had to struggle with the place, because you were told
you were British with an allegiance to the monarch, yet there was a
feeling that you were Irish.
   ``If you managed to get through it, there was a great advantage
to draw from such a background and to be able to write British as
well as Irish charcters. It gave me a wide canvas on which to
paint.''
   After taking a master's degree in poetic drama at Queen's
University, Belfast, Parker taught from 1964 at Hamilton College in
Clinton, N.Y., returning home five years later to start his writing
career.

   U.S. undercover agents have cracked an
international smuggling ring that relied on South African soldiers
to kill endangered rhinoceros in Angola, federal authorities said
Thursday.
   Three Connecticut residents were arrested and the U.S. government
was seeking the arrest and extradition of three South Africans,
including an army sergeant major in a parachute unit who smuggled a
rhinoceros horn into the United States while attending a sky-diving
event.
   Officials said the six smuggled into the United States black and
white rhinoceros horns; seven AK-47 machine guns; cheetah skins and
leopard skins, including one allegedly owned by former Rhodesia
Prime Minister Ian Smith.
   More arrests were possible, said U.S. Attorney Stanley A. Twardy
Jr.
   Twardy said at a news conference those charged in the scheme
indicated to undercover agents they had enough rhino horns to earn
hundreds of thousands of dollars.
   A. Eugene Hester, the Northeast Regional director of the U.S.
Fish & Wildlife Service, said the seizure and purchase of the rhino
horns by undercover agents was the largest haul of its type in this
country.
   The importation of rhino horn is illegal in most countries,
including the United States, because the animal is nearly extinct.
Still, an illicit trade reportedly worth $3 million a year
flourishes in the Middle East and eastern Asia, where dealers pay
$450 a pound wholesale.
   Rhino horn powder in the United States can sell for up to $450 an
ounce, Twardy said.
   In the Far East, rhino horn is ground into traditional medicines
that are said to reduce fever and stop nosebleeeds. It is also
treasured in North Yemen, where the horns are carved into dagger
handles that sell for up to $15,000 each.
   There were at one time 120 species of rhinoceros, but only five
species now remain, including black and white rhinos.
   Arrested Wednesday night were John C. Lukman Jr. 34, of
Newington; Mary Ann McAllister, 33, of West Hartford; and Russell D.
Beveridge Jr., 32, of Newington, Twardy said.
   Each of the defendants was charged with conspriracy to commit an
offense against the United States, a crime that can be punished by
up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Twardy said other
charges would be filed.
   Lukman, McAllister and Beveridge appeared in U.S. District Court
in Hartford on Thursday. McAllister and Beveridge each were released
on $25,000 non-surety bonds, but Lukman's case was continued to
Friday because officials feared he might leave the country.
   According to court documents, the six defendants agreed to sell
five to seven rhino horns to a Fish & Wildlife Service agent for
$40,000 each. In August, Lukman sold an undercover agent a 3.6
kilogram white rhinceros horn for $40,000, the documents state.
   Lukman also asked undercover agents to sell a leopard rug that
his ``friend,'' Ian Smith, had given him. He reportedly had visited
Smith in August in Zimbabwe, the court documents state.
   ``We do know he does have a relationship with Ian Smith,'' Twardy
said, adding that Smith was not a target of the investigation.

   Police exchanged gunfire with students
and the two largest universities suspended classes indefinitely
Thursday on the third day of student riots over the killing of 14
fishermen by Venezuelan troops.
   Police surrounded Caracas' Central University and and firing
broke out between police and students inside. There were no
immediate reports of injuries. Traffic was blocked around the
university.
   Police spokesmen claimed the students possessed automatic
weapons, and witnesses confirmed gunfire was coming from inside the
grounds.
   Students looted several vehicles, including a candy truck from
which they distributed candy among themselves, the witnesses said.
   In the first two days of rioting, at least 15 students were
wounded at the university, said student spokesman Bernardo Ansidey.
   Ansidey said the students planned to continue their protests. He
did not say if students were using firearms against police.
   Central University, with more than 50,000 students, and the
University of the Andes in Merida, 300 miles southwest of Caracas
with more than 30,000 students, suspended all activities.
   In Merida, the state governor ordered troops on alert and had
tanks standing by in case the riots did not die down. Students there
inflicted almost $1 million worth of damage by sacking stores in the
commercial district, according to Ramon Diaz Suarez, a reporter for
Frontera, a Merida newspaper.
   Suarez said student-police battles at Merida over the three days
had left at least 20 students wounded, bringing the national total
to at least 35 students injured. He said at least seven police were
injured.
   Earlier Thursday, two survivors of the massacre of 14 people by
Venezuelan border guards said they still fear for their lives
because of what they saw.
   An opposition party deputy accompanying the men at a crowded news
conference claimed informers told him that not all 14 men died on
the spot and some were executed later.
   Showing sworn documents which said they were Venezuelan
fishermen, Jose Augusto Arias, 35, and Wilmer Gregorio Pinilla, 27,
denied any connection with Colombia's National Liberation Army, the
leftist movement to which Venezuelan military authorities suspect
the fishermen belong.
   ``They can kill us so that we don't say anything. We are afraid
they will kill us so we cannot act as witnesses,'' said Pinilla.
   They maintained the group was fishing Saturday on the Arauca
River near their town of El Amparo, 360 miles southwest of Caracas,
when Venezuelan troops suddenly opened fire.
   A military commander later said the group carried weapons and
leaflets issued by Colombian guerrillas.
   But the survivors contend they carried only a fishing net, two
knives and a machete. They said the only political propaganda they
had was a portrait of Carlos Andres Perez, the Venezuelan government
party's candidate for the Dec. 4 presidential election.
   Most fishermen belonged to the government Accion Democratica
party, they said.
   ``We know nothing of guerrillas. We had just turned off the motor
of our canoe to get close to the river bank when the shots started.
They gave us no warning,'' said Pinilla. He said he and Arias swam
to El Amparo.
   Socialist deputy Walter Marquez, who accompanied the two men,
said he was told that not all of the 14 died in the initial attack.
   ``They were executed later. There is no other way to explain how
the (Venezuelan security police) knew (Pinilla's and Arias') names
before the survivors appeared,'' Marquez said.
   He said the cadavers were stripped of their clothes and dressed
with others carrying Colombian army bands to support military
authorities' insistence that the dead men were guerrillas.
   Marquez said he would call for Congress to solicit autopsies.

<TEXT>
   Algerians on Thursday massively approved
a series of constitutional changes, inspired by bloody riots a month
ago, to loosen the grip of the sole political party on national life
and separate it from the government.
   The Interior Ministry announced early Friday that 92.72 percent
of those who voted said yes to the changes proposed by President
Chadli Bendjedid.
   The referendum is the first step in reforms that eventually may
permit independent candidates to run for office and remove the
state-run economy from central control.
   The ruling National Liberation Front led the fight that won
independence from France in 1962 and has controlled the North
African country's political, economic, social, cultural and judicial
affairs ever since.
   A month after riots rocked Algeria, voters peacefully cast
ballots at 36,775 polling stations throughout the country. Turnout
was put at 83.08 percent of Algeria's 12 million voters.
   Bendjedid voted soon after polls opened at the Ghazali school in
the El Mouradia section of Algiers.
   At the Concorde School for Boys in the Bir Mouradais
neighborhood, businessman Joubi Wacer placed his ballot in a brown
voting box and said: ``It's the beginning of change. After this,
things will be different. At least I hope so.''
   Crowds of young men and a few veiled, elderly women walked to and
from the school, where a single blue-uniformed guard stood by the
gate. There was no indication of special security in the capital and
shoppers filled downtown streets in the late afternoon.
   Last month, soldiers and police fired on mobs of young men,
killing 176 people by official count during the week of riots.
Unofficial reports put the number of dead at 400 or more.
   Demonstrators in Algiers and provincial cities were protesting
food shortages, unemployment and a decline in the standard of living
blamed on the plummeting price of oil, Algeria's chief export.
   In a televised speech at the time, Bendjedid tried to ease the
unrest by promising a greater voice to people outside the National
Liberation Front.
   Kamel Belkacem, publisher of the pro-reform weekly newspaper
Algerie Actualite, said the proosals on Thursday's ballot were
designed to ``put an end to the party's power monopoly, and they
offer the challenge of democracy to the country. It's extraordinary,
a veritable revolution for Algeria.''
   Belkacem said in an interview that he expected the country to
enter a period of ``democratic apprenticeship'' after the vote.
   In presenting the referendum as a first step, Bendjedid said
further changes would be considered by a party congress later this
month and submitted to voters in another referendum next year.
   The National Liberation Front will remain the sole legal party,
but Belkacem said he believes the president's ultimate goal is free
and open elections.
   Several provisions in Thursday's referendum make subtle but
important changes that separate the government from the party. For
instance, new wording in the constitution would say the president
``incarnates the unity of the nation'' rather than ``incarnates the
unity of the ... party and the state.''
   Some powers, not specified, would be shifted from the president
to the premier, who would answer to the parliament for his
government's policies. The premier now answers only to the
president, and in practice has only limited authority.

   A 22-year-old policeman died late
Thursday night after bandits, two of them disguised as police, shot
him in the head with a sawed-off shotgun during Denmark's biggest
postal robbery, Danish radio said.
   The robbers fled early Thursday with booty of nearly $1.5 million
_ $1.3 million in Danish and foreign currency and $190,000 in bonds,
the report said.
   The holdup took place at the central post office as postal
workers were unloading a truck which had just returned from picking
up deposits from post offices, where many Danes pay their bills.
   The four robbers were allowed on the premises after two of them
dressed as police flashed what appeared to be badges. They knocked
down one of the guards in the truck and loaded 30 sacks full of
money into an orange van.
   A police patrol chanced by and tried to stop the holdup. One
officer was blasted at close range before the robbers sped off in
the van. The second patrolman fired at the van as it sped away,
shattering its rear window.
   The van was later found abandoned in a city garage.
   Police said they had few clues.
   Police and passers-by gathered at the shooting site after the
death of the young policeman was announced, leaving flower wreaths
and lighting candles.

   Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos said
Thursday he will comply with a federal judge's order that he and his
wife Imelda submit their fingerprints, voice prints and handwriting
samples to a grand jury.
   ``I'll take my destiny, whatever that may be, but I'm going to
fight for my dignity and honor,'' Marcos told The Associated Press
in an exclusive interview, his first meeting with the press since
being indicted two weeks ago on racketeering charges.
   U.S. District Judge John Walker ordered the former president and
first lady of the Philippines to appear Wednesday at the FBI's
offices in Honolulu to comply with the subpoenas.
   If they don't, said Walker, ``the Marcoses, both Ferdinand and
Imelda, must appear before me on Nov. 10 for imposition of
sanctions.''
   Marcos, accused with his wife of plundering more than $100
million from their homeland and spending it in the United States,
said he would meet his legal obligations and had been offered no
promises by the federal government.
   ``No, I am not afraid of going to jail,'' said Marcos, who sat in
a wheelchair during the interview. ``I would probably be dead by the
time the trial is over. I'm feeling in pain every day.''
   The Marcoses and eight others were indicted after more than two
years' investigation. Other grand juries here and in West Virginia
are still investigating Marcos, but he said he was sure he would be
vindicated.
   ``I don't think they have any evidence,'' said Marcos, citing
past investigations in the United States, the Philippines and Japan
which he said cleared him of similar charges.
   Marcos did not say whether he would testify before a
congressional subcommittee investigating allegations that he
illegally funneled millions of dollars into President Reagan's 1980
and 1984 campaign funds, but denied the accusations.
   ``We never contributed to any political activities in the United
States and the Federal Elections Commission reached that same
conclusion,'' he said.
   Marcos, 71, said he held no hard feelings for President Reagan,
who had hailed Marcos as a staunch U.S. ally and allowed the
Marcoses to settle here after their fall from power in February 1986.
   ``It's nothing personal ... we just feel that the worship of the
Statue of Liberty may have been displaced,'' Marcos said. ``We feel
betrayed by an American system that we believed to be fair and just
... now it seems that is not true.''
   Mrs. Marcos pleaded innocent in New York on Monday, but her
husband's arraignment was postponed pending a report by a government
physician who examined him the same day.
   Defense lawyers contend Marcos is too frail for the 10-hour
flight to New York and the interview with the AP was cut short by
aides who said Marcos was late for a medical appointment.
   During Thursday's hearing at federal court in New York City,
which Mrs. Marcos did not attend, Walker did not specify what
sanctions he would impose but said he would ``hold in abeyance the
issuance of a bench warrant'' for their arrests.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Linda Imes, in arguing that the material
was still needed despite the couple's indictment last month and Mrs.
Marcos' fingerprinting this week, revealed ``there is an ongoing
investigation'' by the grand jury.
   She would reveal no more in open court, citing grand jury secrecy
laws.
   Marcos lawyer Sandor Frankel said the couple sought a stay
earlier in the day from U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall.
   After earlier losses in the legal wrangle before Walker and the
2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York, the Marcoses are
seeking a hearing before the Supreme Court and asked Marshall to
stay any action against them until the high court decides on whether
to hear their case, said Frankel.
   ``Barring a stay, they will comply with (Walker's) order,''
Frankel told reporters after the hearing.
   The Marcoses were indicted on racketeering charges by a federal
grand jury in Manhattan Oct. 21 for allegedlly diverting more than
$100 million from their nation's treasury into Swiss bank accounts,
Manhattan real estate and fine art.
   The same grand jury subpoenaed the couple earlier this year for
fingerprints, palm prints, voice and handwriting samples and also
for their authorization for foreign banks to turn over their
financial records.
   The Marcoses balked, claiming they still maintained
``head-of-state immunity,'' but Walker dismissed that claim and
found them in contempt of court in August.
   A federal appeals court upheld Walker's finding and reinstated
the contempt finding as well as an arrest warrant for the Marcoses.
   ``It's the government's position that it's now time for
compliance with these subpoenas,'' Ms. Imes told Walker.
   She requested that if the couple did not comply by Monday, they
be arrested and jailed.
   But Frankel said: ``President and Mrs. Marcos will comply with
their legal obligations,'' adding, ``There's no need for any warrant
to compel their compliance.''
   Mrs. Marcos was arraigned and pleaded innocent to the
racketeering charges Monday. Her exact whereabouts were unknown
although she was believed to be visiting with tobacco heiress Doris
Duke, who posted more than $5 million in bonds as bail for her
friend.

   U.S. Department of Energy documents filed in
court show evidence of previously undisclosed releases of
radioactive materials into groundwater from the Fernald uranium
processing plant, state officials say.
   More radioactive radium was released into an aquifer under the
plant than had been realized, increasing the potential health threat
to nearby residents, state officials said. The Great Miami aquifer
provides water to some southwestern Ohio communities and businesses
near Fernald, 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati.
   Ohio Environmental Protection Agency officials said they learned
of increased radium releases into the Great Miami River system and
into waste pits at the plant from documents in a $300 million,
class-action lawsuit that neighbors of the plant filed against its
former operator, National Lead of Ohio Inc.
   ``It's definitely new stuff. We're not aware of it,'' Ohio EPA
spokesman Graham Mitchell said Wednesday. He said the state EPA did
not know radium had ever been dumped into the waste pits at the Feed
Materials Production Center plant's 1,050-acre site.
   The documents, filed by the U.S. Department of Energy, are part
of the defense the department has prepared for National Lead of Ohio
Inc., the 37-year-old plant's operator prior to 1985, when
Westinghouse Materials Co. took over.
   The residents sued in U.S. District Court three years ago,
contending NLO allowed radioactive uranium dust to escape from the
plant, damaging their health and property. The Energy Department
says NLO was innocent because the company was ordered by Energy
Department officials to violate environmental regulations in favor
of increasing production.
   Energy Department officials have refused to close the Fernald
plant, saying its operations do not pose environmental dangers or
put nearby residents at risk. But the department has begun a
10-year, $500 million clean-up and modernization effort.
   News of the radium releases, which the documents say occurred
between 1966 and 1974, comes after politicians and environmentalists
responded angrily to recent reports of greatly increased estimates
of the amounts of uranium dust released by the plant into the
atmosphere. Radium is a byproduct of decaying uranium.
   ``Day after day it's another revelation, one worse than the
other,'' U.S. Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, said. ``It's like the
Chinese water torture.''
   Luken said he would ask the U.S. EPA to inspect the plant
immediately.
   The documents reviewed by Ohio EPA were reports and letters
written by officials from the Energy Department and NLO Inc. They
indicated that releases of radium into the Great Miami River had
exceeded water-pollution standards in effect at the time, Ohio EPA
officials say.
   Plant managers also worried about the amount of radium they were
dumping into a waste pit at the site, the documents said.
   Steve Wyatt, a spokesman for the Energy Department, said the
amount of radium put into the pit was minuscule.
   The plant is one of 16 nationally that produce nuclear weapons
materials for the Department of Energy.
   Several other plants, including Savannah River in Georgia and the
Rocky Falts plant near Denver, are in various stages of shutdown
while investigations are conducted into health and safety problems.

   Tobacco heiress Doris Duke says she put up Imelda
Marcos' $5 million bail because she is ``disgusted, embarrassed and
ashamed'' with the way the U.S. government has treated the former
Philippine first lady and her husband.
   ``I have always believed that an accused person is innocent until
proved guilty. I wish the rest of America agreed with me,'' Miss
Duke, 75, said in written response to questions submitted by the
Daily News.
   Miss Duke, once called ``the richest girl in the world,'' said
she would gladly testify as a character witness for the Marcoses,
whom she said she considers her ``dear friends.'' The couple is
charged with looting the Philippine treasury of more than $100
million.
   ``I am disgusted, embarrassed and ashamed of my country's
mistreatment of Imelda and her ailing husband, Ferdinand,'' Miss
Duke wrote. ``Why should America spend millions and millions of
dollars prosecuting two people who for a generation have been our
closest allies, including our Pacific outpost against communism?''

   Theft is so rampant at state enterprises in
Cuba that ``1 million police'' couldn't stop it, according to a
secret documentary produced by Cuban security forces for the island
nation's leaders.
   Copies of the crime documentary and another on the alienation of
Cuba's young people were smuggled out of the island by a defector.
   A screening of the two documentaries, produced by the National
Revolutionary Police in 1986, was held Tuesday evening under the
sponsorship of Freedom House, a New York-based human rights group.
   The second documentary concludes that many of Cuba's young people
are alienated, lack revolutionary fervor and complain that
recreational facilities are often run down, non-existent, off-limits
or inaccessible.

   The Hitler-Stalin pact that helped precipitate
World War II has disappeared along with other documents from the
Soviet Union's national archives, says a leading Soviet historian
and archivist.
   Yuri N. Afanasyev also said that much of the state archives, the
repository for memories long denied to Soviet citizens, remain
closed to scholars despite glasnost, Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy
of selective openness.
   ``I don't know for a fact that the Stalin archives haven't been
destroyed. I do know that some very important documents have
disappeared,'' said Afanasyev, director of Moscow's State Historical
Archives Institute since 1986 and a confidant of the Soviet leader.
   ``For instance, the (Hitler-Stalin) pact and the secret protocols
that go with it have vanished, they're simply not in the Soviet
archives,'' Afanasyev said of the 1939 non-aggression accord that
freed Nazi Germany to invade Poland and led to the Soviet seizure of
Polish territory and takeover of the Baltic republics of Estonia,
Latvia and Lithuania.

<HEAD>With Peace Talks Stuck, Civil War in Sudan's South Drags On</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DALIA BALIGH</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   With neither rebels nor army able to
muster a knockout punch, the civil war in southern Sudan has become
a stalemate with both sides using the area's 6 million civilians as
pawns.
   Relief experts count as many as 260,000 civilian deaths related
to the war this year alone. Innumerable thousands more are suffering
under siege warfare tactics being practiced by both sides.
   Government forces control most major towns, but the rebel Sudan
People's Liberation Army (SPLA), which seeks autonomy for the
southern region, is blockading many, keeping supplies out and
starving people in. Some relief officials like Brian Wannop of the
United Nations Development Program charge that the insurgents
intentionally force others from their homes and into displaced
persons camps to embarrass a government unable to care for them.
   At the same time, Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi's government in
Khartoum refuses to allow relief into rebel-held areas. It has
expelled several relief agencies on grounds they dealt with the
rebels in providing help.
   In late October, it was disclosed that the United States had
asked the SPLA for safe conduct to airlift food to 100,000 people in
the besieged southern town of Aweil, where an estimated 8,000
starved last summer and a similar fate still threatens thousands
more.
   The rebels withheld approval without a promise of an equal amount
of aid going to a nearby town they control.
   As deprivation leads inexorably toward man-made famine throughout
an area as large as Texas, the war drags on with neither side
indicating willingness to yield.
   Although the rebels have scored some recent battlefield
successes, engagements remain relatively small, hampered by
logistics problems on both sides.
   Tim Niblock, director of the Middle East politics program at
Britain's Exeter University who has specialized in the study of
Sudan for 20 years, sees little hope for change.
   ``At present, neither (side) has enough power to change the
situation,'' Niblock said in a telephone interview from Exeter.
   ``Unless there is a political breakthrough, which seems very
unlikely unless the government in the north changes, I cannot
imagine that either side can win with the present balance of power.
There will be a continuation of the present situation.''
   A string of peace initiatives and even pressure from Western aid
donors have failed to close the gap between government and rebel
positions.
   During five years of war, a third of southern Sudan's civilian
population has been put to flight in search of a haven in northern
Sudan and neighboring Ethiopia. The remaining 4 million people
either are holed up with the army in major southern cities and towns
or roam the countryside, trying to avoid looting and attacks by
rebels.
   The government accuses the rebels' main backer, Marxist Ethiopia,
of being behind the insurgents' refusal to negotiate a settlement.
Many Western experts believe the government's insistence on
perpetuating Islamic law in Sudan is goading the rebels to continue
the fight.
   The roots of the conflict are complicated, but it boils down
basically to a war between the Arab-descended Moslem majority in the
north and the ethnically African Christian and animist minority in
the south. This cleavage has existed during much of Sudan's recent
history, which began with independence from Britain and Egypt on
Jan. 1, 1956.
   Traditionally, the north has dominated the country. It has kept
from the south income from sales of southern mineral wealth and
crops, putting precious little back into the backward southern
society.
   A renegade army colonel, John Garang, began his rebellion in the
spring of 1983, demanding autonomy for the three southern provinces,
a larger share in the economy and administrative reforms.
   Then-President Gaafar Nimeiri imposed Islamic law throughout
Sudan the following September, fueling the insurrection. After the
army overthrew Nimeiri 18 months later, Garang vowed to fight on
until Islamic law, or Sharia, is abolished.
   Prime Minister el-Mahdi refused, saying that Garang is trying to
dictate how Sudan's 16 million Moslems should live, but unlike
Nimeiri, the prime minister agrees to exempt non-Moslems from
Islamic law.
   On the battlefield, the government admits that the rebels have
made gains in recent weeks. It described the losses of six
government garrisons as tactical withdrawals.
   Western military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the rebels also are putting increased pressure on an important
garrison at Nasir in the Upper Nile province.
   Taking Nasir, they said, could give Garang's movement a strong
foothold to increase its attacks on the central and western parts of
Upper Nile. Additionally, pressure on Torit in the Equatoria region
could open the rebels' way to the important southern capital Juba,
the Western sources said.
   ``There is a deterioration of the situation in eastern Equatoria
and in Upper Nile around Nasir,'' el-Mahdi said in an interview.
``(But) the security situation in the rest of the country is much
better, and no doubt these advances will be revoked as in the past.''
   The successive setbacks sent the government into action.
   The defense minister, Abdel-Maged Hamed Khalil, and Commander in
Chief Fathi Ahmed Ali made hushed-up visits to Libya and Iraq in
early October and arranged military aid, including ammunition and
bombs. Western analysts speculated the army planned to use the new
bombs to mount air raids on eastern Equatoria and relieve pressure
on government installations there.
   Diplomats said the rebels have held an upper hand in the fighting
for 18 months, even during last winter's dry season when the
government traditionally takes the offensive and recovers lost
ground.
   During rainy seasons, ending in late October, the rebels
emphasize their bush-fighting skills. Small, lightly armed units
move easily, using tall grass as cover for hit-and-run guerrilla
tactics. Government forces become virtual sitting ducks in their
garrisons.
   Western military experts in Khartoum said many army troopers are
demoralized by a lack of supplies, food and medicines.
   Nevertheless, said Niblock, the British expert, the rebels ``have
a disincentive to gain further territory in the south, (because)
they can't feed the people in areas they control. That creates a
certain balance.''
   He said that although the rebels claim control over 90 percent of
the southern countryside, large areas remain under neither side.

<TEXT>
   Midnight street theater, Cuban jazz,
flamenco dance, roving street clowns and mimes: It's all part of the
International Cervantes Festival, a two-week celebration staged each
fall in this charming colonial city.
   The 16th annual edition of Mexico's cultural event features about
150 dance, theater and music repertory groups from 57 countries and
Mexico.
   It also draws countless ``unofficial'' folk bands, clowns and
mimes to the twisting cobblestoned streets and hidden alleys of
Guanajuato, a 16th century silver mining town about 225 miles
northwest of Mexico City.
   ``The festival is an expression of friendship between peoples,''
says Lourdes Gomez, a spokeswoman for the Cervantino, as the event
is known in Spanish. ``People forget about their troubles, and
culture overcomes crisis.''
   Each year, thousands of visitors from Mexico and abroad enjoy
near-continuous performances staged in streets, theaters, parks and
open-air stages throughout the city.
   The sounds of Andean flute music give way to brass, reggae and
rock 'n' roll. Strollers always seem to be gathered on some street
or plaza enjoying an impromptu mime act or a play sandwiched between
the festival's headline events.
   Among them was the stirring performance last week by Mario Maya's
flamenco dance company, the Andalusian Gypsy Theater. The sharp,
clipped vibrations of the troupe's exaggerated handclapping and
foot-stepping were felt throughout the four-tiered Juarez Theater.
   The choreographer, born into a Gypsy family that lived in a cave
in Granada, Spain, says he began experimenting with forms of
flamenco dance theater in the 1960s as a way to fight the
marginalization of Gypsy culture under the Franco regime.
   ``For me, it was a necessity. Flamenco was a way of expression,
of spreading the culture through theater,'' Maya says, describing
his efforts as the ``folklorization'' of flamenco.
   The troupe's sharp dance score, complemented by an encore of
individual performances, elicited bravos and a standing ovation in
the theater.
   The smell of roasted corn husks filled the air as Jose Maria
Vitier's nine-piece jazz band from Cuba torched the open-air stage
at Guanajuato's downtown granary, the site of bloody fighting during
Mexico's fight for independence from Spain.
   With Vitier hammering on a Steinway and electric pianos, and
Lazaro Gonzalez on violin, the ensemble sped through 12 numbers that
included a percussion-driven rendition of Keith Jarrett's ``My
Song.''
   Those who weren't at the granary were on the street in front of
the Juarez Theater, surrounding Indian saxophonist Kandri Gopalnath
as he knelt on a 7-foot square Persian rug and wailed on the
instrument.
   Fusing the Western sax with Eastern musical strands, Gopalnath's
free-form instrumental at times differed little from the sounds of
sitar and provoked wondrous stares from some in the crowd, and
evident delight among others.
   Guatemala's Fine Arts Marimba ensemble offered a melodious
sampling of ancient Meso-American songs inside the colonial Temple
of San Diego church. The group displayed the remarkable flexibility
of the marimba in wrapping up its performance with mambo, merengue
and even polka numbers.
   With Guanajuato's streets under cover of darkness, a woman in
peasant dress emerged from an alleyway into the central Plaza Jardin
pounding on a drum and heralding the beginning of a phantom-like
spectacle by Italy's Tascabile de Bergamo theater troupe.
   The silent drama, ``Albatross,'' was performed by four actors on
stilts, draped in white and scarlet and carrying torches. Its story
of lovers who are threatened by the seductress albatross coursed
through Guanajuato's narrow streets at midnight as the crowd of
spectators eagerly followed.
   The play reached its dramatic conclusion in the Plaza Jardin when
other ``evil'' albatrosses appeared screaming on rooftops above,
their white robes in stark contrast against the night sky.
   These were but a sampling of the Cervantes Festival's offerings
to a delighted public. The Jamaican reggae band Chalice, Britain's
eclectic Bow Gamelan Ensemble, the Soviet Union's Vilnius Opera
Ballet Theater, Anna Sokolow's dance company and Igor's Cowboy Jazz
Band from the United States also staged appearances.
   The University of Guanajuato, a prominent fine arts institution,
supplied numerous student theater and musical performances
throughout the festival. But they and dozens of repertory groups
from Latin America and the world will be back next year.
   ``We're already working on it,'' says Gomez.

<HEAD>With Eye Toward Elections, Rajiv Gandhi Becomes TV Figure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>SHARON HERBAUGH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With his political opposition in
disarray, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi has been traveling about the
country meeting the people and cameras of the government-run
television network have been close behind.
   Gandhi is not required to call an election until the end of 1989,
but speculation is mounting in the press that he will call what is
known as a ``snap'' election as early as March to take advantage of
the disorder in opposition ranks.
   Some Indians see television as a factor that could help Gandhi
counter his fall in popularity in recent years. An opinion poll in
August indicated a united opposition could easily defeat Gandhi's
long-entrenched Congress Party and deny him another five-year term.
   In recent days millions of people in cities and villages have
watched on television sets as Gandhi toured violence-torn Punjab or
trekked through mud and water to villages inundated by flash floods,
his Italian-born wife Sonia a step behind.
   The scenes have become a regular part of the 20-minute Hindi-and
English-language newscasts on the government-run television network
Doordarshan.
   When Gandhi came to power following the assassination of his
mother, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, four years ago, television's
influence spanned less than 20 percent of the country. But his
closest aides immediately recognized its importance.
   ``His mother used television mainly for political purposes _
important rallies and speeches and her trips aboard,'' said Ashis
Nanday, a political analyst with the Center for the Study of
Developing Societies.
   ``Her son has taken it one step farther, using it to project
himself not only as a leader but as a person. To a large number of
Indians, he is the first Indian prime minister who is also a
television personality.''
   Today, television is available in almost 75 percent of the
country. The entire country will be within reach of Doordarshan's
transmitters by the end of next year, when an election must be
called.
   Gandhi's travels before the camera come as a fractious and
pugnacious opposition is trying to rally under the green flag of the
Janata Dal (People's Party).
   Janata Dal, a patchwork of three regional parties, is pinning its
hopes on Viswanath Pratap Singh, a former Gandhi ally and now one of
the prime minister's most vocal critics. But the new coalition party
has been beset by bickering, internal power struggles and
accusations of corruption and nepotism.
   After the opinion poll suggested a united opposition could unseat
Gandhi in the upcoming elections, the biweekly magazine India Today
wrote of Janata Dal: ``While its leaders pontificate piously about
the evils of the Rajiv Gandhi government, they themselves are no
angels. And as they spit and bark and growl at each other in a
public display of pettiness that passes off for `unity talks' they
do themselves, the voters and the nation a grave disservice.''
   The poll, conducted for India Today, indicated Gandhi's
popularity had plunged to an all-time low and that if the opposition
could come together and remain united, it would be within striking
distance of ousting the Congress Party, which has governed for all
but 29 months of India's 42 years as an independent nation.
   But the poll also indicated that nearly two-thirds of the 13,000
voters questioned didn't know the 54-year-old Singh, the
opposition's leading candidate.
   Singh seemed unconcerned, however.
   ``I have patience,'' he said. ``Let me exhaust my weapons before
I show my trump card.''

<HEAD>Italy Making a Start on Saving Seas Around It</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCES D'EMILIO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>USTICA, Sicily (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two bright yellow buoys in the cobalt blue
sea around this volcanic island protect an increasingly endangered
Italian treasure _ clear, clean water and the rich marine life in it.
   The buoys also mark one of the government's first efforts to save
the seas that surround Italy _ the Ligurian, Tyrrhenian, Adriatic,
Ionian and Mediterranean.
   From sea floor to surface, from shore to three miles out, the
crystalline waters surrounding Ustica, an island about 35 miles
north of Sicily, have been decreed a natural marine reserve.
   Along with a small corner of the Adriatic near Trieste to the
north, Ustica was the first to enjoy special protection under a
decree by the environmental and merchant marine ministries in
November 1986.
   The decree called for 18 more reserves _ among them Sardinia's
sapphire seas and the thermal waters of the Aeolian Islands off
Sicily's northeast coast. But so far Ustica and Trieste are the only
ones to be created.
   In Ustica's case, the buoys mark a slice of the reserve in which
just about every activity is forbidden: fishing from boats or
underwater, boating and even swimming, except for two small inlets
where bathing is permitted. Local authorities can restrict fishing
permits for the rest of the island's waters, and undersea fishing is
forbidden around half of the island.
   Ustica's volcanic rocks and caves snare plankton carried by
strong, cold Atlantic currents entering the Mediterranean through
Gibraltar to the southeast and flow by the island. Plankton, tiny
forms of sea life, are key links in the food chain for the island's
exotic undersea greenhouse-menagerie. The results are 24-hour
undersea dining rooms as colorful as found in the tropics.
   Some samples from the sea swim in three fish tanks set up in an
18th-century stone guard tower on a bluff overlooking the reserve.
   Each tank represents a different depth of the sea. There are
crimson ``sea tomatoes,'' which look like jelly apples, spindly
orange coral and ``sea roses'' _ creatures that seem like flowers
spun out of delicate pink lace. There are urchins, too, although
fishing and disease have whittled down their numbers.
   Visitors can also see a slide show about fish too large for the
tanks as well as strange denizens of the deep such as a sex-changing
fish and ``sea spaghetti,'' a plant that winds up in local salads.
   For 30 years, the island, with its spectacularly clear waters,
has hosted gatherings of the world's top divers and undersea
specialists, including the legendary Jacques Costeau.
   Ustica's waters once abounded in large stone bass, but no longer.
Fishing with drag nets and indiscriminate catches by underwater
fishermen have cut down the population of the species.
   The World Wildlife Fund in Italy, which manages the Trieste
reserve, estimates that the planned total of 20 reserves would
protect barely 2 percent of Italy's coastal waters. Counting the two
reserves and other small stretches of seashore watched over by
environmental groups, the WWF says only 40 miles of Italy's 5,000
miles of coastline now have some kind of protection.
   ``We can't wait 10 years'' for the other 18 reserves, says
Antonio Canu, of the WWF's Rome office. ``The sea will be ruined.''
   This summer was especially harsh for Italian waters. In July,
bathers had to abandon a fashionable Tuscan beach for a week after
an explosion at a pesticide plant spilled toxic chemicals over a
stretch of Italy's northwest coast.
   On the east coast, gondoliers and their tourist clients in Venice
endured the stench of decaying algae, which flourished on tons of
untreated industrial and human garbage pouring into the lagoon.
   For environmentalists, Ustica is an intelligent marriage of
nature and tourism.
   Mayor Nicola Longo sees the reserve as a chance to control
possible damage from tourism, which is relatively new to Ustica.
   Until the 1950s, Ustica's guests were few and included suspected
Mafiosi sent into exile; before that, opponents of the Mussolini's
Fascist regime were confined on the island. They included Antonio
Gramsci, a founder of the Italian Communist Party, who recalled in
letters from Ustica that the islanders hadn't heard of radio when he
arrived in 1926.
   Like the mayor, who also makes the island's only wine for sale,
many of the 1,200 islanders have two or more jobs or enterprises _
restaurant owners catch their customers' fish, part-time fishermen
tend hillsides terraced with grapes or capers and fenced off by rows
of prickly pear trees.
   Usticesi, as the islanders are known, leave the island to go to
high school in Palermo on Sicily. Many of them never come back,
except for summers, since work is scarce on the island.

<TEXT>
   When James Freedman took over as president
of Dartmouth College last year, many on campus and among the alumni
anticipated another in a line of reserved, don't-make-waves leaders.
   Surprise.
   Unafraid to stir hornets' nests, Freedman has made his mission
clear: ridding Dartmouth of what some call its ``smart jock'' image
and revealing the school as a haven for gifted students, top-notch
faculty and ``creative loners.''
   He's also taken on an off-campus student newspaper whose hardline
conservative stands and activism have brought Dartmouth publicity it
doesn't want.
   Though most faculty members, trustees and alumni seem pleased
with Freedman, critics warn that the first president snce 1822 with
no prior connection to this Ivy League school is trying to create a
``North Harvard,'' a Dartmouth alien to its own traditions and
history.
   Freedman, 52, a Harvard graduate with a law degree from Yale,
came to the college about 130 miles northwest of Boston in July
1987. A former president of the University of Iowa and dean of the
University of Pennsylvania's law school, he now presides over about
4,800 students who pay $13,300 a year.
   Shortly after arriving, he made clear his aggravation with the
image of Dartmouth students as ``extroverted, gregarious,
party-going, athletically oriented, overly prone to conformity,
well-rounded and intelligent _ but not intellectual.''
   ``That stereotype doesn't describe the Dartmouth student body as
a whole,'' he said in an interview. ``I see people who are writing
novels, I see people who are acting in plays, I see people who are
making films ...''
   Freedman wants to attract more top scholars, women and
minorities; broaden exchange programs with foreign universities; and
enhance the life of the faculty by letting members expand their
study and research.
   He began the ``Presidential Scholars'' program, flying in top
high school scholars who were considering Dartmouth and offering
them VIP treatment. Of 201 students targeted, 63 chose Dartmouth
this year _ double the enrollment of top scholars last year.
   The program also increased the number of women and minorities _
the current freshmen class is 45 percent women, up from 38 percent.
About 25 percent of the freshmen are minority students, up about 2
percent.
   But critics question Freedman's programs.
   ``Why do you persist in turning Dartmouth College into an
elitist, intellectual, international university?'' Hobart Van
Deusen, a 1958 alumnus, asked in a letter in the Alumni Magazine.
``Why do you not preserve Dartmouth traditions?''
   Jeffrey Hart, an English professor and faculty member since 1963,
said Frn't know that Dartmouth needs that.''
   A diverse, 18-member search committee unanimously chose Freedman
from 619 applicants, and explained search chairman Norman
McCullough, ``In James Freedman, the clear indication was that we
were looking for an academician, one who would lead the faculty in a
collegial style, and really one who could capitalize on an
institution that was ripe for the next phase of growth.''
   ``I don't think there's any intention to change the basic
character of Dartmouth,'' said George Munroe, who succeeded
McCullough as chairman of the college trustees.
   ``If we can upgrade its intellectual distinction _ which is
already very high _ that's all to the good. And to the extent that
we can downgrade what some call the `Animal House' image, that
certainly is all to the good.''
   Freedman said his goals are traditional Dartmouth aspirations,
but the college cannot be static. For example, he said, ``It's
essential for Dartmouth to have foreign students here if our
students are going to be prepared for an international world.''
   In a March speech, Freedman showed his mettle _ and consolidated
the opposition _ when he publicly chastised the off-campus Dartmouth
Review, the contentious weekly founded in 1980 with the support of
such prominent conservatives as William F. Buckley and Patrick
Buchanan.
   The Review has been central to many campus controversies,
including the 1986 smashing of symbolic anti-apartheid shanties on
the college green.
   That incident inflamed an already polarized campus and provoked
demonstrations, arrests, a rare suspenion of classes for a
campuswide forum on racism, student takeovers of campus buildings
and a faculty vote of no-confidence in Freedman's predecessor as
president, David McLaughlin.
   Early this year, white Review staffers and a black music
professor clashed, again prompting cries of racism.
   After writing that Professor William Cole's course was ``one of
Dartmouth's most academically deficient,'' the student reporters
argued with Cole in a classroom while seeking his reaction. Three
were suspended for disrupting the class and harassing Cole, whom the
Review had earlier described as looking like ``a used Brillo pad.''
   Freedman's March speech to the faculty and news media denounced
Review reporters as ``ideological provocateurs posing as
journalists'' who engage ``in malicious bullying tactics'' that
threaten Dartmouth's commitment to diversity.
   ``There was a real need for the kinds of words he spoke to be
pronounced by somebody who had official leadership of the college,''
said David Sices, a 1945 graduate who has taught French and Italian
for 31 years at Dartmouth.
   Henry Eberhardt, director of the Alumni Fund for nine years,
agreed. ``Nobody had the guts to stand up and say that before him,''
he said. ``It was long overdue.''
   Van Deusen saw things differently.
   ``He's appeasing the faculty, just as simple as that,'' he said.
``He obviously wants to get one of the big constituencies of
Dartmouth on his side and he obviously did that.''
   Hart said Freedman turned an issue of ``academic quality and
civility and manners'' into ``a racial cliche.'' A Wall Street
Journal editorial said the incident illustrated discrimination
against conservatives on campus.
   The Review's lawyers have filed lawsuits alleging racial
discrimination, against whites, and free-speech violations.
   And conservative columnist James Kilpatrick wrote that Dartmouth
``has behaved shamefully. Only the most devoted friends of this
small college could love it now.''
   As the disputes persist, Freedman acknowledges his outsider's
view of Dartmouth makes his job tougher.
   ``But I do think it gives you a very great opportunity,'' he
said. ``You just see the place through fresh eyes.''

<HEAD>Reporter Trades Notepad For State Investigator's Job</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN SAYRE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For more than two decades, Bill Lynch
tried as an investigative reporter to ferret out corruption in a
state where kickbacks and sweetheart deals were as much a part of
the culture as Mardi Gras and Cajun cooking.
   Shortly after Gov. Buddy Roemer took office in March, Lynch
traded his notepad and job with the New Orleans Times-Picayune for
the newly created post of state inspector general.
   His job may have changed, but his mission hasn't.
   ``We've never had an office before dedicated to the idea of
running state government in an honest manner, the way we can all be
proud of,'' Lynch said.
   His reputation as an investigative reporter was such that when
the Legislature passed a bill tacking on punitive damages to libel
judgments in the late 1970s, the statute became known as the ``Lynch
Law.'' The law was later repealed.
   Lynch, 59, is the chief investigator for a governor who
campaigned on the need to root out corruption in Louisiana _ a
legacy dating to the 1930s reign of Huey P. Long.
   Starting with Long's legendary ``deduct box'' containing money
extorted from state employees for his political purposes, political
history here has been checkered. The ``Louisiana Scandals'' of 1939
resulted in the imprisonment of former Gov. Dick Leche. In 1986,
former Gov. Edwin Edwards was acquitted of racketeering charges.
   ``Corruption in government has virtually been a way of life,''
said Lynch. ``The thing we want to do is to turn that around. Both
nationally and internationally, Louisiana has been looked upon with
disdain, contempt. We want to change that perception.
   ``But most importantly, we want to change the substance. We don't
want people just to perceive that we're honest people, honest
government. That's what Roemer asked me to do.''
   How does Roemer rate Lynch's performance so far? ``Excellent,''
the governor said.
   ``We inherited a mess and one person can't clean that up. A
governor can't do that alone,'' Roemer said. ``We thought during the
campaign and during the transition that the office of inspector
general with enough teeth, enough staff and enough independence to
check every agency one by one would be in the taxpayers' best
interest.
   ``I think Bill's done a terrific job. A number of small
suggestions and small savings and a number of big-picture
modifications.''
   For example:
   _ Lynch's investigation into the Louisiana Racing Commission,
which regulates the state's horse racing industry, revealed payroll
abuses and allegations that a commission telephone at Louisiana
Downs, the state's major track, was used to relay information to
bookmakers. Roemer replaced the entire commission.
   _ Lynch's office recommended the dismissal of the executive
director and the board of the Governor's Special Task Force On
Education, which handled federal grant programs for students at
vocational-technical schools. Some students had to drop out because
of delays in processing the grants, according to an inspector
general's report. Roemer is reviewing the report.
   _ Since a state official was investigated for using a government
telephone for private long-distance calls, the state's monthly
telephone bill has dropped by about $280,000 a month, the Roemer
administration says.
   _ Numerous violations of state travel regulations within agencies
that generate their own funds through fees were uncovered. Lynch's
office said members of the Real Estate Commission traveled at state
expense on a junket to Hawaii.
   Lynch's job is limited to the executive branch of government.
Twenty-two auditors work under him and he reports his findings
directly to the governor.
   ``The primary objective of this organization is to save money
through the honest operation of government,'' he said. ``Government
was not just put here for the personal (use) of the individual,
though you couldn't tell it from the past several decades.''

<TEXT>
   Among the poor European immigrants to America's
urban centers earlier in this century were many with the same goals:
first a job, then some savings, and eventually a good place to live.
   Several other goals were high on the list, but none was higher
than getting the kids educated to be ``real'' Americans. At the
other end were the dreams of success, and even of owning a few
shares of American Telephone & Telegraph Co.
   Their first homes usually were two- or three-family houses in
poor areas. Single-family units were out of the question since they
provided no rents and often cost just as much. Immigrants knew the
value of rents.
   They knew also how much they could afford, and while they saw
many houses they would have loved to own, they settled for the
rundown structure they could fix up with their own hands. They made
do with what they had.
   The rundown house was their financial foothold in the new country.
   Many decades later, it is still the immigrants, now from other
parts of the world as well, who follow this practice. Some of the
offspring of the earlier immigrants follow it, too, but many others
scorn it as beneath their status.
   The negative attitude toward rundown multiple units is a
significant factor in one of the most publicized of housing
problems, the alleged inability of young, first-time buyers to
afford a home of their own.
   Many of them can, but many decline to seize the opportunity, the
same one that makes immigrant eyes bulge with amazement.
   Among arguments heard by real estate people is that such houses
offer few amenities, require too much time-consuming labor and cause
the landlords to live in areas not appropriate to their view of
themselves.
   A survey by ERA Real Estate, a national chain, found that 49
percent of first-time buyers would consider delaying a purchase if
the home they could afford fell short of their ideal.
   The irony of the attitude is that home prices seldom fall to
accommodate the savings of would-be buyers. Whatever savings they
are likely to accumulate are offset in the meantime by higher prices.
   Meanwhile, the means to the home of their dreams is right before
them if for the time being they can put up with something less. That
is, the best way to the house of one's dreams is to settle for the
house that is less than ideal.
   ``First-time homebuyers need to think about building equity with
a home purchase now and then leveraging that later into the home of
their dreams,'' says Ed Gresham, ERA president and chief executive
officver.
   It makes a lot of sense.
   The less than desirable home may grow in value at a rate faster
than the market in general, thanks in part to the owner's fix-up
efforts. The mortgage provides automatic savings. Tax benefits
reduce the owner's federal income tax.
   The first home might not have a swimming pool, a patio, a
recreation room and a modern kitchen and baths, but it has been
shown over and over again to be a great way of obtaining all that in
just a few years.
   Strangely, the immigrant with little knowledge of American
economic ways spots the opportunity almost immediately. The
country-born can stand right before the answer and not see it.

<HEAD>`Second City' Isn't Kidding This Time in Arty Showtime Special</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Early in ``Second City's 15th Anniversary
Special,'' a promising, unknown character appears on the screen.
   ``I've laid a bunch of trips on actors at the Second City,'' says
this character, identified as ``Del Close, director.'' He wears a
hideous red shirt and waves a cigarette, his mouth turned down in
the relentless grimace of a society matron.
   ``And some of these they've been able to use and some they
haven't _ but I'm going to loop back to your previous question for a
second, because embedded in it is part of a question I didn't answer
...''
   Amazing! Who's doing this guy? Eugene Levy? Joe Flaherty? Martin
Short? Terrific makeup. It could even be Catherine O'Hara.
   But the realization comes that this is Del Close, director at
Second City in Toronto, and he really wants to talk about serious
dramaturgical issues. Improvisation _ boon or bane?
   Yes, Second City is getting serious on this hour-long Showtime
special, which appears Saturday at 10 p.m. EST. Repeat dates are
Nov. 8, 16, 21 and 27.
   Del is all for improv, a specialty of the Second City troupe. He
loves improv not as a method of developing material, but for itself.
   ``Like fireworks, the most ephemeral of art forms. Once it's
gone, (finger snap) it's gone, baby.''
   Then comes Bernard Sahlins, director, who thinks Del is, if not
all wet, a bit moist. For Bernard, improvisation is ``not a really
presentational form.''
   So you thought Second City did comedy, huh?
   Fortunately, most of the hour is devoted to laughs. Levy,
Flaherty, Short and O'Hara are all present, and so are Andrea
Martin, Dave Thomas and Robin Duke. There are also two very funny
guys who weren't part of the SCTV experience, John Hemphill who
appears as the gunsel Johnny Prolongo, and bald, nervous Don Lake,
who plays a very bad lounge singer with a yen for Peru.
   There's no rust on these clowns yet. However, there is just a
smidgen of self-congratulation in this special, as if the two Emmys,
a dozen Emmy nominations, all the Canadian awards and the critical
adulation has been taken too seriously.
   It shows in the montages of black-and-white photos of times past,
reminding the viewer that Dan Aykroyd and Gilda Radner were in the
original Toronto cast and that John Candy was later a star. The same
photos remind you that they aren't in the special.
   There is a feeling of dread that Barbra Streisand will begin
crooning ``The Way We Were'' at any moment.
   It never gets that far out of hand. Short, notably, can talk
about technique without being pompous.
   ``Stallone and I had the same approach toward improvisation,'' he
says. ``A few words, just impact with physical, fall down, hit a
wall, hair like that, go WAAA-HA-HA!''
   There are four skits in the show, each beginning with the stage
version and then intercutting to a much more polished version _ with
costumes, makeup and scenery _ done for the cameras.
   Short appears twice, as the old bore Brian Allen (``I'm Brian
Allen, and this is my wife, Mrs. Brian Allen'') and as Robespierre.
He's funny on stage, but hilarious on camera. His Robespierre on
stage isn't quite sure who he is, but on film Short adds a dazzling
series of smiles, simpers and eye flutters.
   Levy, appearing as a snooty French waiter in the Brian Allen
sketch, shows yet again why he has the best spectacle-and-eyebrow
act since Groucho Marx. Above the nose, Levy may be the funniest man
alive.
   Catherine O'Hara is divine, and Andrea Martin is wonderful, and
Thomas is funny, and isn't it awful that SCTV still isn't on the
air, even at 1 a.m. like it was when you had to sit through some of
the worst of the ``Saturday Night Live'' casts to catch the show on
NBC?
   But can't we just be happy that Short, Flaherty and O'Hara are
doing ``The Completely Mental Misadventures of Ed Grimley'' every
Saturday, and they're doing movies, and every once in a while
someone drags out an SCTV retrospective that gets lousy ratings and
means SCTV probably won't ever be back?
   Maybe Del Close has it right. Maybe SCTV, like fireworks, was the
most ephemeral of art forms. And ``once it's gone, baby, it's gone.''

<BYLINE>Helping Migrant Students Succeed, Despite Rootless Life</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By DONNA BRYSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MALDEN, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Every year, schools in southern Missouri
welcome hundreds of children who are as rootless as the tufts of
cotton that drift with the autumn leaves through the streets of this
Bootheel town.
   The Southeast Missouri Migrant Education Center here, part of a
federal network that includes a southwest Missouri branch in Monett,
helps local schools bring some stability to the lives of the
children of the migrants _ who pick apples and melons, work in
cotton gins and poultry plants, moving with the seasons to make a
living.
   For Tracy Oldnette, a slight 12-year-old with a shy smile, the
program means a special relationship with Mary K. Scott, a migrant
education teacher in the Monett school system.
   Tracy has been enrolled in Monett schools three different times.
Each time he spent part of his school day with Mrs. Scott, who is
both friend and tutor to the migrant children with whom she has
worked for 17 years.
   ``When we need help, she's always there,'' Tracy said.
   He estimates with a vague shrug that he has attended six or seven
different schools as his family worked its way through Missouri and
Arkansas.
   As a migrant student, his school and health records are stored in
a central computer in Little Rock, Ark. Local centers can receive
copies of records in a matter of days after migrant students enroll
at a new school.
   The local centers also provide teaching supplies to the tutors
who work with migrant children. Staff nurses at the centers act as
health educators and oversee the funds used to help the children buy
glasses and meet other medical needs.
   ``We're the only program in the schools that can take care of
health needs. That's the strong point of our program,'' said Keith
Hill, director of the Malden center. ``It's hard to study and pay
attention if you've got a toothache.''
   The Missouri centers, serving about 1,000 with a combined budget
of roughly $500,000, are links in a national chain established by
Congress in 1966 to improve education for disadvantaged children.
   ``There's lots of programs to help special children,'' said Tony
Woodrum, director of the Monett center. ``This just happens to be
the one that helps children whose families move a lot.''
   The program stresses early childhood education and tries to help
migrants who have dropped out of school or who have taken longer
than average to obtain a high school diploma.
   To be eligible, a student must have moved within the past year so
that a parent or other family member could obtain seasonal work in
agriculture or fishing. A student can continue in the migrant
program for up to five years after his or her family has stopped
moving.
   The Monett center is installed in shopping center within sight of
Monett High School. The Malden center is housed in a converted
skating rink.
   Migrant teachers, some paid by the state or local school boards
and others paid by the federal government under the migrant
education program, work with children in small groups. They build
skills that were lost in the shuffle of moves.
   Younger children may be behind in reading or math skills; with
older children, teachers address more complicated problems.
   ``Through their movement, I know they're going to have a hard
time learning the necessary things about applying for a job, or
maybe not meet with a counselor enough for him to work with him on
selecting a career,'' Hill said.
   Hill and Woodrum said that as children grow older and insist on
staying with familiar friends and schools, parents are more likely
to abandon migrant work. The educators acknowledge, however, that
many older children simply drop out to work in the fields, perhaps
despairing of any chance to break the cycle.
   ``You see it coming,'' Mrs. Scott said, ``but what can you do to
hold it off?''
   She added, ``One of our goals is to improve their self-confidence
_ so that they don't feel bad that they don't have roots in a
community. We point out that there are good things about having
lived in so many places.
   ``We've had some students that came in in the middle school and
have graduated. I don't know whether I had anything to do with it or
not, but I feel good about it.''
   Some students grow determined not to follow in their parent's
wandering footsteps.
   Said 11-year-old J.R. Seelye, ``I want to go to college.''

prosecutor from Anchorage, attacked the incumbent as beholden to
special interests. Young, 44, stressed his 16 years of experience in
Congress.
   Officials of both major parties expected Bush to win the
presidential contest easily. Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis'
support of some controls on handguns and his opposition to oil
exploration in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge hurt his chances
with the oil-rich state's largely conservative voters.
   State Democratic Party chairman John Pugh conceded Bush was
favored, but said Dukakis was ``doing better than any Democratic
candidate in a long while'' in Alaska.

   Democratic Sen. Dennis DeConcini fended off
last-minute attacks as he sought a third term Tuesday, while George
Bush was favored to claim Arizona's seven electoral votes _ and
continue a 40-year GOP victory string.
   DeConcini, who raised $3 million for his campaign, led Republican
Keith DeGreen by up to 46 percentage points in pre-election polls.
But the challenger was handed a new issue in the closing days when
it was revealed DeConcini had bought land in the paths of federally
funded water projects and had sold some of it to the government at a
profit.
   As DeGreen expanded his campaign advertising with the help of a
$223,000 donation from his party's Senatorial Committee, DeConcini
conceded that the contest might be getting close.
   In the presidential race, Michael Dukakis seemed headed for the
same defeat suffered by every other Democrat since Harry Truman
carried Arizona in 1948. An Arizona Republic poll taken shortly
after the second presidential debate showed Bush leading Dukakis 61
percent to 29 percent.
   Democrat Rep. Morris Udall and his four Republican House
colleagues all were expected to win re-election.

   Voters were expected to award Arkansas'

funding of abortion except to save a mother's life.
   Bush led Democrat Michael Dukakis by margins of 47 percent to 41

by the Arkansas Democrat and Arkansas Gazette in October. The
margins of error were 3.5 and 5 respectively.
   Dukakis appeared to gain little from the support of popular Gov.
Bill Clinton, whose nominating speech on his behalf at the
Democratic Convention became notorious for its length and dullness.
   Democrats were expected to maintain their 3-1 edge in U.S. House

from Democratic Lt. Gov. S.B. Woo.
   In the presidential race, Vice President George Bush was expected

   Woo, the nation's highest-ranking elected official of Chinese

civic activist Samuel Beard by 71 votes.
   But the independent-minded Woo, who often bucked the Democratic

   Democratic Sen. Spark Matsunaga was considered a shoo-in to win a

   Much voter interest was devoted to an initiative proposal on a

residents were polled and neighboring islands traditionally vote
heavily Democratic.
   Fasi, a former Democrat turned Republican, was opposed by former

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis carried a narrow lead
over George Bush to the wire in Iowa, where their only competition
for statewide attention was a little-noticed effort to change the
way the two top state officials are elected.
   Because of the lack of major races and Iowa's first-in-the-nation
precinct caucuses last February, most eyes have been on the state's
eight electoral votes. Both Bush and Dukakis finished third in the
caucuses.
   Bush suffered from unpopular Reagan administration farm policies
and a Democratic edge in voter registration. But the Republican
rebounded, and the last poll published by the Des Moines Register in
early October showed Dukakis ahead 49-38 with 13 percent undecided
and a 3.1 percent margin of error.
   The election change being sought would allow the governor and
lieutenant governor to run as a team, instead of independently.
Since 1982, the two offices have been split between the parties,
leaving the lieutenant governor with little to do.
   Republicans were expected to continue their 4-2 edge over
Democrats in the state's U.S. House delegation.

<HEAD>Despite 2-1 Edge for Democrats, Bush Victory Likely</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite a Democratic registration edge of
better than 2-1 and hard campaigning by neighbor Lloyd Bentsen,
Republican George Bush was rated the favorite to pick up Oklahoma's
eight electoral votes Tuesday.
   Late pre-election polls showed the vice president expanding his
lead, and Republicans predicted the ticket of Bush and Dan Quayle
would garner at least 53 percent of the vote over Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis and Bentsen, the senior senator from Texas.
   But Dukakis' Oklahoma spokesman Bob Burns said support for Bush
was soft in the state, which has been hard hit by precipitous
declines in the energy industry.
   The current congressional delegation consists of four Democrats
and two Republicans. The only close race was in the 1st District,
where incumbent Republican Jim Inhofe faced Democrat Kurt Glassco.

<HEAD>GOP Hopes Heinz Will Pull Bush to Victory</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a turnabout of the usual coattails
scenario, Republicans hoped a strong showing by Sen. John Heinz
would carry George Bush to victory in Pennsylvania's close
presidential race.
   An Oct. 28-30 poll by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and the
Philadelphia Daily News showed Heinz favored for a third term by 75
percent of the 618 registered and likely voters surveyed. Democrat
Joseph Vignola, former Philadelphia city controller, had 18 percent,
with 5 percent undecided.
   The same poll showed Bush with 46 percent, Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis with 46 percent and 5 percent undecided in the
battle for Pennsylvania's 25 electoral votes.
   Bush's attack on Dukakis' positions on gun control and abortion
appeared to have helped the vice president in rural central
Pennsylvania, as well as in the traditionally Democratic northeast
region. Heinz has been campaigning across the state, focusing on
Bush's election rather than his own.
   No change was expected in the current lineup in the state's U.S.
House delegation of 12 Democrats and 11 Republicans.

<TEXT>
   Questions of ethics put Republican Gov.
Edward D. DiPrete and 14-term Democratic Rep. Fernand J. St Germain
in jeopardy as they sought re-election Tuesday.
   Democrat Michael Dukakis led Republican George Bush most of the
summer in the quest for Rhode Island's four electoral votes, but
late October polls gave conflicting readings on whether the
Massachusetts governor still led in his own back yard.
   Republican Sen. John H. Chafee appeared comfortably ahead in his
bid for a third term against Democratic Lt. Gov. Richard A. Licht.
   In the governor's race, Democrat Bruce G. Sundlun, a
communications executive who lost badly to DiPrete in 1986, took a
nine-point lead in polls. DiPrete, seeking a third term, was hurt by
allegations that he engaged in improper business dealings, showed
favoritism in the granting of state contracts and that his
administration hired a reputed mobster's ex-wife for a job on the
Governor's Justice Commission, then fired her two days later.
   St Germain, powerful chairman of the House Banking Committee,
faced Republican lawyer Ronald K. Machtley. The challenger tried to
capitalize on reports that the House Ethics Committee had not
finished its review of allegations that St Germain underreported his
assets by more than $1 million and accepted gifts from lobbyists.
   The state's other House member, Republican Rep. Claudine
Schneider, appeared assured of re-election.

<TEXT>
   Charles S. Robb, a former governor and
son-in-law of President Lyndon Johnson, looked for a landslide
victory over a longshot GOP opponent Tuesday to become Virginia's
first Democrat elected to the Senate since 1966.
   But the strength of Robb, who led by as much as 50 percentage
points in polls over Republican Maurice A. Dawkins, did not appear
to be helping Democrat Michael Dukakis' quest for the state's 12
electoral votes.
   In a poll released Wednesday, Republican George Bush led Dukakis
55 percent to 39 percent.
   Robb and Dawkins, a retired black minister and Washington
lobbyist, were vying for the seat of Republican Paul S. Trible Jr.,
who passed up a bid for a second Senate term and plans to run for
governor in 1989.
   Also on the ballot was a pari-mutuel referendum. Virginia voters
narrowly defeated horse-track wagering 10 years ago, but a lottery
referendum passed easily last year.
   Five Democrats and five Republicans were expected to win
re-election to the U.S. House.

<TEXT>
   Republican Slade Gorton sought a rare Senate
comeback Tuesday against liberal Democratic Rep. Mike Lowry, while
George Bush appeared to have the edge over Michael Dukakis in the
battle for Washington's 10 electoral votes.
   Gov. Booth Gardner, a popular first-term Democrat, was heavily
favored to win re-election over state Rep. Bob Williams, an
evangelical conservative who found Gardner an elusive target.
   Voters also faced competing ballot issues to create a state
Superfund for cleanup of toxic waste dumps, and a two-step measure
to hike the state minimum wage.
   In the presidential contest, one late poll put Bush ahead by more
than 8 points in a state that had tilted Dukakis' way earlier.
   Gorton, who lost the state's other Senate seat to Democrat Brock
Adams two years ago, was in a close race with Lowry for the job of
retiring Republican Sen. Dan Evans.
   The U.S. House delegation was likely to stay at five Democrats,
including Majority Leader Tom Foley of Spokane, and three
Republicans.

<HEAD>Arch Moore's Bid for Fourth Term in Jeopardy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Gaston Caperton's free-spending
bid to deny Republican Gov. Arch Moore an unprecedented fourth term
highlighted Tuesday's ballot in West Virginia, where what once had
been seen as an easy victory for Michael Dukakis turned into a tight
race.
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, a five-term veteran who intends to step down
as Senate majority leader, was opposed by freshman GOP state Sen.
Jay Wolfe. The Republican was unable to match Byrd's well-financed
campaign and slick television spots and prompted an outcry with one
of his own anti-abortion ads that showed a bloody fetus.
   Caperton, a Charleston insurance executive seeking his first
political office, spent $2.1 million to win a seven-way primary and
more than $1.7 million against Moore. He built up a double-digit
lead over Moore in pre-election polls as voters registered
dissatisfaction with high unemployment and a state economy that had
to borrow $80 million to keep operating this year.
   But Moore, who must rely on crossover support in heavily
Democratic West Virginia, traditionally fares better than the polls
indicate.
   In the presidential race, Dukakis' early lead over GOP candidate
George Bush evaporated, and even supporters of the Massachusetts
governor called the race for the state's six electoral votes a dead
heat.
   Three of the state's four congressmen, all Democrats, faced token
opposition.

   Republicans appeared poised for a sweep of
top races on the Wyoming ballot Tuesday, with Sen. Malcolm Wallop
and Rep. Dick Cheney favored to win re-election and Vice President
George Bush expected to capture the state's three electoral votes.
   Wallop used a war chest of $1.2 million in his bid for a third
term against Democratic state Sen. John Vinich. The incumbent's
advertising portrayed Vinich as anti-business and anti-growth but
pro-labor and pro-taxes. Vinich countered the liberal tag by
pointing to an ``A'' rating from the National Rifle Association and
by saying if helping senior citizens and working to generate jobs
meant he was a liberal, then that was fine.
   Cheney, a five-term incumbent, was opposed by Democrat Bryan
Sharratt.

<HEAD>Facing 1969: Sex, Drugs, War, Rock 'n' Roll</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In ``On Golden Pond,'' Ernest Thompson wrote
about the differences among three generations. In ``1969,'' he deals
with just two, but deepens the gap.
   ``1969,'' which the Academy Award-winner wrote and directed,
takes place, not surprisingly, in 1969 and centers on the friendship
of two college freshmen. With the Vietnam War and the draft looming
in the background, the students are caught up in many of the issues
of the time: sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll, politics.
   ``I do get into the battle of generations and the
misunderstandings, but there were different dynamics in this movie
and the generations are closer,'' he said in an interview. ``I think
it's an effort on my part to scrunch it together.''
   Thompson, a sophomore at American University in 1969, readily
admits that the film is based on his own experiences. ``It was a
fulcrum time for me. I didn't have any illusions that I was going to
be saying something definitive about a whole era. It was very
personal.
   ``It's about a handful of characters trying to develop some
emotional conscience even if it's on a limited scale.''
   Robert Downey Jr. and Kiefer Sutherland star. While Downey's
rebellion comes in the form of promiscuity and drugs _ he has an
acid trip during the film _ Sutherland is more intellectual,
concerned with the fate of the world.
   Thompson had to bridge a generation gap of his own while working
with Sutherland on a scene eventually cut from the film.
   ``He was to wake up in the morning in the van and when we were
about to shoot it, I told Kiefer, `We'll just have the doors open
and we'll zoom the camera in on you.'
   ``And Sutherland said, `I won't have the doors open.' I said,
`Yeah, it's easier to have the doors open.' He said, `I wouldn't
sleep with the doors open in the city.' I said in 1969 you would. It
was an open door spirit. There wasn't that fear there is now.''
   Thompson no longer feels the sense of community that existed for
him as a student: ``I always had a feeling that I'd go back and the
'60s would still be there waiting for me, but they weren't. There
was a real feeling of fraternity _ just something as seemingly
trivial as giving the peace sign and having someone give it back.''
   Thompson was born in Vermont, but grew up in Maryland, which
serves as the setting for ``1969.'' He studied theater arts at
American and Catholic University and achieved minor recognition
during the 1970s when he starred in the Broadway revival of
``Picnic.''
   In 1981, he won an Academy Award for the adaptation of his play,
``On Golden Pond.'' Henry Fonda starred as Norman Thayer, an
outspoken old man who fears his imminent death. Fonda, who won his
only Oscar for the role, died soon after.
   With Katharine Hepburn, who won her fourth Oscar, and Jane Fonda
also starring as Thayer's wife and daughter, ``On Golden Pond''
grossed over $120 million. It was Thompson's first experience
working on the set of a feature film, and understandably, a
memorable one.
   ``It was a very warm and supportive environment,'' Thompson said,
adding that the atmosphere of the recent ``Sweetheart's Dance,'' for
which he wrote the screenplay, was far more difficult.
   ``I think largely because (co-stars) Don Johnson and Susan
Sarandon came from a school where you don't nurture and you don't
respect the writer and the script. It was a free-for-all.''
   Not so with Fonda and Hepburn.
   ``I came in with two giants as artists but real ladies and
gentlemen of the theater,'' he said. ``Their background was the
theater and they treated text and their fellow workers with
tremendous generosity and affection. With `1969,' I tried to
recreate that warm bath that `On Golden Pond' had.''
   Thompson had little interest in cashing in on his overnight
success, and didn't start working on the screenplay of ``1969''
until four years ago.
   He had an uneasy relationship with his father, much like the one
the Sutherland character has with his father, played by Bruce Dern,
in ``1969.''
   ``My father died almost 10 years ago when I was in my late 20s,''
he said. ``I was able to cross some of those bridges but we had a
long way to go. We would not have been confused as best friends. We
had a lot of divergent points of view.''
   Yet Thompson's happiest memory of ``1969'' was Dern's performance.
   ``I'm proud that he was able to trust me,'' he said. ``I would
tell him stories about my own father and he would take that and run
with it.''
   So what will happen to the Downey and Sutherland characters?
Where are they now?
   ``I think that Robert joined the National Guard and didn't run
for Vice President,'' Thompson cracked. ``He's probably a good old
guy around town and has five children.''
   And Sutherland?
   Thompson smiled, ``I thought Kiefer would grow up and become an
Academy Award screenwriter.''

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After three dubious comedies, Whoopi Goldberg
has returned to drama in a new film that is being hailed as
recapturing the magic of her debut in ``The Color Purple.''
   In ``Clara's Heart,'' she again portrays a downtrodden figure, a
Jamaican domestic with a tragic past who tries to help a troubled
rich boy neglected by his parents.
   The reviews have helped offset the notices for Goldberg's interim
movies _ ``Jumpin' Jack Flash,'' ``Burglar'' and ``Fatal Beauty'' _
not that she is ashamed of the comedies.
   ``I'm not sure they were comedies,'' she said, laughing loudly.
   ``I wasn't completely satisfied with them, but I was not
embarrassed. I discovered on my (concert) tour, that people
responded to the films. They liked `Jumpin' Jack Flash.' I might
have to go and watch it again. Because I was living in this
microcosm of criticism: `It wasn't as good as you could do,' etc.
   ``I gave my best to every film I did; I'm not embarrassed by any
of them. Even the ones I really didn't like, I knew that my
performance in them was as good as it could be. How a studio or a
producer or a director chose to edit it and how the marketing people
said it was supposed to be sold _ that's a different story. That has
little to do with the script I performed.
   ``No one said that I was bad. They just said they weren't pleased
with my choices.''
   She reserved special scorn for ``Fatal Beauty,'' in which she and
Sam Elliott played big-city crime busters: ``It was a tough, gritty
script that would have had a great message about dope. Instead, they
turned it into a kind of `Rambette.'''
   How does she manage to shift gears between comedy and drama?
   ``I don't know,'' she admitted. ``I guess it's what I've always
been told actors are supposed to do. That's the idea, that you're
supposed to be able to go in and out of these `emotional bedrooms'
at a drop, which I like.
   ``I'm an actor who on occasion is funny. Sometimes sad. I cannot
now take on the responsibility of `comedian' because it's too much.
You have to be too on top of it all the time. I need places to take
rest. So I tell stories where I can find a little ledge to sit down
with time to think about what I'm doing.
   ``My stories will have those moments of humor, moments of
sadness, moments of triumph, lull moments which comics are not
allowed to have. You get a lull moment with a comic and it's a
killer. A lull in my act and you get to go to the bathroom.''
   Goldberg, 32, started out early as an actress, beginning as an
8-year-old in a Manhattan housing project. She joined a settlement
house drama group and acted in neighborhood children's productions.
After a period on drugs and a broken marriage that left her with a
daughter, she landed in San Diego in 1974. In theater companies
there and later in Berkeley, she began honing her comedic skills.
Along the way she jokingly took a Jewish surname and added Whoopi as
a given name to replace her own, Caryn Johnson.
   ``I had no idea, truly, that people thought I was funny, except
from doing all this bizarre street theater,'' she said. ``Suddenly,
when I started putting together my own work, people would laugh and
I'd go, `Wow!' then I'd try something else, and they'd laugh.
Intervals of laughter are wonderful.''
   With no immediate movies on tap, she is headed for outer space.
She has signed on the USS Enterprise for a series of appearances on
``Star Trek: The Next Generation.''
   ``Why not?'' she reasoned. ``First of all, it's a job; I love to
work. I've been on the road for five months. I don't think I've been
home during the past five years for more than a month. I want to be
home. I want to wait for a good film to come along, but I also want
to work.
   ``So why not get on a show that has good actors and fun writing
and a potential for anything _ future, past, present? For instance,
you can change your being, change the way you look. Why not?''
   Besides, Goldberg is a longtime, registered Trekkie.

<HEAD>Time to Talk Turkey</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thanksgiving is still a couple of weeks off,
but now is the time to start planning the meal, especially if turkey
will be on the menu.
   The giant bird finds its way onto American tables most often
during the holiday season and many cooks deal with these fowls only
rarely.
   That prompts the U.S. Department of Agriculture to issue annual
reminders about safe preparation and handling of turkey.
   Frozen turkeys can be bought now and stored in the freezer until
a few days before needed, then placed in the refrigerator to thaw.
   If you don't want them taking up all that space, order a fresh
turkey ahead of time and pick it up the day before Thanksgiving.
   Many stores are offering fresh, pre-stuffed turkeys. These may be
time savers, but the Agriculture Department doesn't recommend them.
   The stuffing can create incubator-like conditions for the growth
of bacteria, and it is nearly impossible for most refrigerators to
keep the stuffing deep inside at 40 degrees Fahreiheit or below.
   The ultimate shortcut is a pre-cooked turkey, but these must also
be handled carefully.
   They are best is served immediately, both from a safety and
flavor standpoint. If a pre-cooked turkey must be stored, remove the
stuffing, separate the meat from the carcass, and store these items
in small packages in the refrigerator.
   One safe way to save cooking time is to use roasting bags, the
department says, since they speed up the process. Cooking the turkey
unstuffed also saves time.
   Microwaves can cook turkeys quickly, but the department warns
cooks not to try to microwave a stuffed turkey; a stuffed bird is
too dense for microwaving to assure thorough cooking.
   Often folks wind up with a frozen turkey bought too late to let
it sit and defrost in the refrigerator for several days.
   The department suggests, as an alternative method, immersing the
bird in cold water which is changed every half-hour or so. Make sure
the bird's wrapping is secure or put it in a plastic bag before
placing it in the water.
   A microwave oven can also be used to thaw an unstuffed turkey, if
the oven is large enough. Follow the manufacturer's instructions.
   Never defrost a turkey on the counter or table top. In the hours
it takes for it to thaw bacteria could muiltiply to dangerous levels.
   And remember when preparing food, use pleney of soap and hot
water to wash hands, utensils and cutting boards to prevent the
spread of bacteria. Wash the sink, counter, faucet handles, anything
that comes in direct or indirect contact with raw turkey.
   Some recipes in recent years have suggested long, slow cooking
for turkeys, but food safety experts frown on this because the bird
may not get hot enough to kill bacteria. Cook it at 325 degrees
Fahreiheit, they say. The food experts also discourage the idea of
partly cooking a bird one day and finishing it the next, for the
same reason.
   Once you've gotten over all these hurdles, cooked the bird, fed
the family and cleaned up, the department has suggestions for safe
storage of leftovers too. Here's the drill:
   Remove the stuffing from the bird and the meat from the carcass.
Store them in meal-size portions in shallow containers. Leftover
turkey will keep in the refrigerator for three or four days.
Stuffing and gravey should be used in a day or two. Bring leftover
gravey to a rolling boil before serving.

<TEXT>
   The folks of Washington state are throwing
a centennial birthday bash, and only the immediate world is invited.
   The ``Celebration of the Century'' kicks off Friday, the
Evergreen State's 99th birthday, and climaxes a year later.
   It was at 5:27 p.m., Nov. 11, 1889, when Elisha P. Ferry got a
telegram _ collect _ from President Benjamin Harrison declaring the
territory to be America's 42nd state.
   The centennial doings combine the homespun with high-tech hoopla.
Main Streets are being spruced up and everybody's roots are being
explored, State Centennial Commission executive secretary Putnam
Barber said.
   The celebration will be a patchwork of hundreds of local events
rather than a grand state production _ a plan that reflects the
state's populist distrust of anything centralized, Barber added with
a chuckle.
   It's designed as a celebration of history and diversity,
creativity and a little bit of Old West hell-raising.
   It'll be hard not to notice:
   _ Imagine a relay race with 5,000 runners retracing the 500-mile
Idaho-to-the-sea Lewis and Clark Trail in just eight days.
   _ Olympic-style amateur athletic games are set for Spokane and
Wenatchee, with a total of 6,000 particants.
   _ Wagon trains, quilting bees, parsons preaching in 1880s garb
and city councils dressed in the style of the year of their town's
incorporation all will add to the color.
   _ Folks in Aberdeen are building tall ships, and Indians are
carving dugout canoes for maritime festivals. ``Wings Over
Washington'' will be a one-day fly-over by hundreds of airplanes.
   _ Among many centennial construction projects and restorations is

   _ Ethnic minorities and their role in state history will be
honored in dozens of ways, including a major new exhibit on Indian
culture at the University of Washington next April and ``Seasons of

   _ Artists performing at festivals through the year include such

Seattle's International Film Festival will be expanded.
   _ Washington's history will be a year-long focus in the schools,

   _ Newspapers are being asked to reprint their first edition and
television and radio stations to replay their first broadcasts. Many
historical books are in the works, including new biographies and
even a state song book.
   First Lady Jean Gardner, co-chair of the Centennial Commission,

   About 1.3 million centennial license plates have been sold so
far, and $1 from each sale goes to support centennial projects.
   By June of next year, the state will have spent $9.5 million on
planning and support for the centennial.
   Asked how the centennial will compare with the nation's
bicentennial, Barber said it will be more focused and more immediate.
   ``The U.S. bicentennial was not about us, and this is,'' he said.
``There was no way to make the events of Philadelphia and Boston
immediate to folks out here. Now we can celebrate the history and
character of our state.
   ``We don't have to say all the real history happens someplace
else.''

<HEAD>Not Just a Presidential Election, but Choosing a Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans aren't just electing a president on Tuesday; they're
choosing a government and, in some cases, changing the rules.
   Ballots includes candidates for president, 33 Senate seats, 435
seats in the House of Representatives, 12 governors' offices, plus
state and local ballot issues and races for mayor, sheriff, state
legislatures and county officers.
   The voting traditionally begins just after midnight EST Tuesday
in Dixville Notch, N.H., where 38 registered voters will get their
moment of media attention by choosing between George Bush and
Michael Dukakis.
   And it ends 25 hours later _ long after the nation is likely to
know the name of its 41st president _ on the treeless, windy western
Aleutian Islands in Alaska.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ALABAMA (9 electoral votes)</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush has a strong lead here, according to the latest University
of Alabama's Capstone Poll, which put the race at 57 percent Bush,
37 percent Dukakis.
   There are no races for governor or U.S. senator on what is a
short statewide ballot for Alabama.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ALASKA (3)</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   GOP state chairman Jim Crawford has predicted Bush will win 60
percent of the vote. Dukakis' support of some controls on handguns
and his opposition to oil exploration in the Alaska National
Wildlife Refuge have been liabilities.
   Democrat Peter Gruenstein, 41, of Anchorage is challenging
veteran Republican Rep. Don Young, 55, a former river boat captain
from Fort Yukon, in the race for Alaska's only House seat.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ARIZONA (7)</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush has a lopsided lead here in public opinion surveys.
   State Democratic chairman Sam Goddard said, however, that a
ballot proposal to make English Arizona's official language should
bring out large number of Hispanic voters in opposition, and ``if
they do come out they'll vote for Dukakis,'' he said. But state GOP
chairman Burton Kruglick contended, ``The don't vote.''
   In the Senate race, a poll published Oct. 26 by The Mesa Tribune
and KTSP-TV of Phoenix showed Democratic Sen. Dennis DeConcini
leading Republican challenger Keith Degreen 44 percent to 18 percent.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ARKANSAS (6)</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Bill Clinton, who made a memorably dull nominating speech
for Dukakis, has worked hard for the ticket at home and in other
states. However, the state still leans Republican and recent public
opinion surveys back that up.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CALIFORNIA (47)</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   With the largest number of electoral votes at stake, California
has been a major campaign battleground. Bush trailed Dukakis by 16
percentage points in a late July poll but pulled ahead by as much as
11 points in one survey after the second debate on Oct. 13.
   ``The debate was the defining moment,'' pollster Mervin Field
said. The race remains close, however.
   Republican Sen. Pete Wilson has led his Democratic challenger,
Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy, throughout the race but the margin has
dwindled a bit in the closing days. McCarthy was able to raise only
about half as much as Wilson, who had $13 million for his
second-term campaign.
   More than $60 million has been spent by insurance, attorney and
consumer groups battling over five competing auto insurance ballot
propositions, and another $17 million has been spent in the campaign
on a cigarette tax initiative, and 20 other statewide ballot
propositions have generated another $15 million in campaign spending.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>COLORADO (8)</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Denver Post-KCNC-TV poll on Oct. 31 showed Bush ahead 56
percent to 37 percent. The vice president made half a dozen trips to
the state, and son Neil, a Denver oilman, has been active in the
campaign.
   The dominant ballot issue appeared to be a tax limitation
proposal spearheaded by realtor David Bruce. It would bar any state
or local tax increase at the state or local unless it was approved
by two-thirds of the voters.
   Gov. Roy Romer strongly opposed the initiative, saying it would
hurt public education. ``Colorado will regret this,'' he said. Bruce
contended Romer was misleading the public, but the Post-KCNC poll
showed the initiative trailing by 50 percent to 41 percent.
   An initiative to make English the state's official language was
leading in the polls, while a vote about restoring state funding for
abortions was too close to call.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CONNECTICUT (8)</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Gov. William A. O'Neill, a Democrat, has said that if Dukakis
can't win in Connecticut, he can't win the election. The most recent
polls indicated a close race, with Bush slightly ahead.
   Republican Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., a nationally known
maverick, found himself in an unexpectedly tough race against state
attorney general Joseph I. Lieberman. Weicker expects to spend about
$2.8 million and Lieberman $2.5 million, a state record.
   Although polls indicate a dead heat, Weicker, who has survived
other cliffhangers, has run negative ads that may be working.

<HEAD>DELAWARE (3)</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Dukakis' summer lead melted to an 11-point deficit in the latest
poll by The (Wilmington) News-Journal papers.
   Republican Gov. Michael N. Castle, leading opponent Jacob
Kershtool almost 7-to-1 in the News-Journal poll and even further
ahead in fund-raising, lent some of his staff to the Bush campaign.
   Despite a slight money advantage, Democratic Lt. Gov. S.B. Woo
trailed incumbent Sen. William V. Roth Jr. The News-Journal poll
showed Roth leading 51 percent to 29 percent.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DISTRICT of COLUMBIA (3)</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Dukakis has a wide lead the district, which has supported the
Democrat in the last five presidential elections.
   Democrat Walter Fauntroy, the city's non-voting delegate to
Congress, has has token opposition to his bid for a tenth term.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FLORIDA (21)</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Dukakis campaign wrote off Florida in early October and sent
campaign workers to more promising states, though Democrats claimed
that tracking polls showed Dukakis narrowing the gap from 25 percent
to 12 percent.
   Democrat Kenneth ``Buddy'' MacKay has taken pains in his Senate
campaign to distance himself from Dukakis on issues such as the
death penalty. Republican Rep. Connie Mack, grandson of the
legendary baseball owner and manager, has played up MacKay's
agreement with Dukakis on defense issues and on withdrawing support
from the Nicaraguan Contras. The Senate race remains a tossup.
   A referendum to make English the state's official language is
also on the ballot.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>GEORGIA (12)</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   An Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll released in October showed
Bush leading Dukakis by 12 points throughout the Southeast, and
local pollster Claibourne Darden predicted Bush to take Georgia by
10 to 14 points.
   However, popular Sen. Sam Nunn has lately pitched in to help
Dukakis, and appeared with the candidate on the stump.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HAWAII (4)</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Dukakis considered the likely victor in a state with a long
Democratic tradition.
   The health of Sen. Spark Matsunaga, 72, has been an issue in his
campaign for a third term, but his 71-year-old Republican opponent,
Maria Hustace, has not raised it directly.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>IDAHO (4)</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Democrats pessimistic. State party chairman Conley Ward recently
conceded Dukakis would do only slightly better than 40 percent of
Idaho vote, and Democratic Gov. Cecil Andrus, who is not up for
re-election, said the campaign could not end too soon for him.
   The state's hottest issue is a constitutional amendment allowing
a state lottery. Lottery opponents, lead by church officials from
various denominations, raised about $500,000, while pro-lottery
forces attracted less than $10,000. A similar measure was endorsed
3-2 in 1986, but later voided by the state supreme court.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ILLINOIS (24)</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A key battleground state, and recent polls showed the
presidential race too close to call.
   Heavily Democratic Chicago is the wild card in the race, with the
outcome there seen as hinging in part on the number of supporters of
favorite son Jesse Jackson who turn out for Dukakis. One problem for
Democrats in Chicago is the divisions created in expectation of a
mayoral election next year.
   Some observers have suggested that the lack of statewide races
depressed interest in the election. Nearly 6.4 million people are
registered to vote, a drop of about 1.5 percent since 1984.

   In Dan Quayle's home state, an Indianapolis Star poll published
Oct. 31 showed Bush with a 57 percent to 36 percent lead.
   In a bitter and costly governor's race, however, Democrat Evan
Bayh, son of former Sen. Birch Bayh, held a 54-40 lead over
Republican Lt. Gov. John M. Mutz in a Star poll. Bayh is the son of
former Sen. Birch Bayh, who was defeated in 1980 by Quayle.
   Through mid-October, Bayh had raised $3.2 million for a tough
television campaign that attacked tax increases during the Mutz's
years of service with retiring Gov. Robert D. Orr, and criticizing
Mutz for his role in extending state aid to a Subaru-Isuzu car and
truck plant. Mutz, who raised $3 million, said Bayh lacks
experience, distorts the facts and, on the Subaru-Isuzu issue, has
pandered to racial prejudices.

   The presidential race was close with a slight advantage to Bush.
   Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes, a Democrat, was favored to win a third

   Opponents of gun control forced a referendum on a new state law

sold in the state and which will be banned. The National Rifle
Association said it would spend between $4 million and $5 million to
defeat a bill that it said could make Maryland the first state to

   Presidential politics overshadowed the only other statewide

M. Kennedy and political newcomer Joe Malone, a Republican. Malone,
33, presented himself as a conservative alternative to Kennedy's
``1960s liberalism.'' Polls suggested that Kennedy would be

Riegle has devoted increasing time to campaigning for Dukakis.
   Dunn became so deperate for funds that he sued the Republican

   Democrats won this state by 3,761 votes in 1984, when favorite

   In the U.S. Senate race, Democratic Minnesota Attorney General
Hubert H. Humphrey III trailed in his attempt to win the seat once
held by his father. A recent Star Tribune poll showed 10-year
veteran Republican Sen. Dave Durenberger leading 53 percent to 42
percent.
   Durenberger, smarting from Humphrey's incessant attacks on his
voting record involving issues such as Social Security, Medicare,
health care and drug programs, withdrew his own negative television
ads for the last two weeks of the campaign. He challenged Humphrey
to do the same; Humphrey instead proposed to suspend all TV ads if
Durenberger would debate him three times every day. The offer was
not accepted.

<HEAD>Productivity on the Rise Despite Bad Second Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Government reports showing a decline in home sales and factory
orders and an anemic boost in productivity gave fresh evidence of a
slowdown in the nation's economy, economists said.
   Wednesday's productivity report by the Labor Department indicated
productivity rose by an annual rate of 1.3 percent from July through
September, reversing a second-quarter decline.
   But analysts said the recent trend of paltry growth in
productivity offered little hope for lifting Americans' standard of
living or increasing U.S. competitiveness.
   Revised figures indicated productivity dropped 2.4 percent in the
second quarter _ much worse than the 1.4 percent decline estimated
previously.
   ``Despite the strong growth of the economy over the past year,
there's still no significant change in a the weak trend in
productivity that we've seen since 1973,'' said Larry Chimerine,
chairman of the Wefa Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., economic consulting
firm.
   ``Productivity growth averaging 1 percent a year remains this
country's major economic problem,'' he said.
   A Commerce Department report showed orders to U.S. factories
dropped 1.9 percent, or by $4.4 billion in September after rising by
3.2 percent in August.
   Orders for non-defense capital goods, a key indicator of business
investment plans, fell by 10 percent to $34.9 billion for the month.
   Another Commerce Department report showed new home sales fell a
dramatic 7.8 percent in September _ the biggest decline in 16 months
_ to seasonally adjusted annual rate of 659,000 units.
   The reports had little impact on the stock market, which finished
mixed in seesaw trading. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
rose 5.87 points to 2,156.83.
   Traders seemed more worried by a continuing slide in the dollar,
which dropped to a six-month low against the Japanese yen and
five-month lows against other major currencies.
   Dollar purchases by the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve,
aimed at propping up the currency, were only partially successful
because market participants felt the central banks were trying to
slow the U.S. currency's fall, not arrest it.
   Gold prices shot upward, partly in response to the dollar's
decline. Republic National Bank of New York said gold bullion was
bid at $420.90 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, up from $411.30 an
ounce late Tuesday.

   Technical buying has pushed oil futures prices

   The December contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
U.S. crude, rose 31 cents Wednesday to close at $13.75 per barrel.
On Tuesday, the December contract slipped 14 cents.
   Prices for refined products traded on the exchange also advanced.
   The December contract for wholesale heating oil rose 0.18 cent a
gallon to settle at 43.35 cents, while the December contract for
unleaded gasoline rose 0.17 cent to 43.79 cents a gallon.
   Andrew Lebow, a trader with E.D.&F. Man International Futures
Inc., said crude oil prices improved in response to an American
Petroleum Institute report that stocks of crude had declined.
   A Wall Street Journal story that crude production by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries jumped to 23 million
barrels a day last week had no effect on trading, Lebow said.
   In recent weeks, reports of stepped-up production by the
13-nation cartel has depressed prices, and traders were surprised
that Wednesday's story did not send prices lower.
   ``I think people really don't know what's fundamentally going
on,'' Lebow said.
   He attributed Wednesday's price movements mainly to technical
factors, but said strong demand helped push gasoline and heating
prices higher.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Treasury Department plans to borrow $30
billion next week to replenish the government's coffers, although
the auctions will not include any 30-year bonds.
   Every three months, the government holds three debt sales to
finance the $2.6 trillion national debt. It normally sells
three-year notes, 10-year notes and 30-year bonds.
   However, Treasury officials said Wednesday that the 30-year bond
will not be part of next week's auction because President Reagan has
not yet signed a tax bill with a provision needed to give the
government authority to issue any more such bonds.
   William Bremner, deputy assistant treasury secretary for finance,
said the tax bill, which cleared Congress right before adjournment,
has not yet reached Reagan's desk.
   He said if the president does get the measure in the next few
weeks, the Treasury will auction a new batch of 30-year bonds
totaling $9 billion later this month or in early December.
   If the Treasury does not get the authority, Bremner said the
government will offer a second short-term debt instrument known as a
cash-management bill.
   The auctions for next week call for:
   _$9.5 billion in three-year notes in minimum denominations of
$5,000 to be auctioned Wednesday.
   _$9.5 billion in 10-year notes in minimum denominations of $5,000
to be auctioned Thursday.
   _$11 billion in a 37-day cash management bill to be auctioned
Thursday in minimum amounts of $1 million. These bills are purchased
by security houses.

   Fixed-rate mortgages are at their lowest levels
since the spring, spelling good news for would-be homebuyers and
builders, but economists warn that the declining interest rates
trend isn't expected to last much longer.
   ``We see continuing problems with the dollar and some increase in
inflation,'' both of which tend to pressure interest rates upward,
Frederick Flick, an economist for the National Association of
Realtors, said Wednesday.
   Flick and other economists say they're looking for rates to reach
about 11 percent in early 1989, compared with the single-digit rates
now available from some big lenders of conventional 30-year loans.
   A recently completed survey of 2,000 lenders by HSH Associates of
Butler, N.J., found about 150 mortgage bankers and thrifts offering
rates between 9.75 percent and 9.875 percent last week. The average
rate was 10.32 percent, HSH said.
   A similar survey by Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., better
known as Freddie Mac, put the average rate on a 30-year mortgage at
10.22 percent, the lowest since April. Earlier this week, the
Veterans Administration cut its maximum rate for federally-backed VA
loans to 10 percent from 10.5 percent.
   All that should help the housing and construction industries,
which have been under pressure recently.
   The Commerce Department reported Wednesday that sales of new
single-family homes fell 7.8 percent in September, to 659,000 units,
the biggest drop in 16 months. The huge decline was accompanied by a
rise in new home prices.
   Flick said that despite Wednesday's report, home sales are
expected to remain relatively robust this year.
   The association's latest forecast predicts sales of existing
homes should total 3.48 million in 1988, near the decade's high but
lower than last year's 3.52 million, while new home sales should
reach 661,000, down from 671,000 last year. The sales forecast for
1989 is 3.28 million existing homes and 601,000 new homes.
   Flick said the current drop in interest rates should improve
sales because it may make home-buying more affordable for some
consumers.
   David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of
Home Builders, attributed the current rate decline to improvement in
the bond market, a barometer of inflation and rate trends.
   Rates in the bond markets where corporate, municipal and
government debt securities are sold, have been falling since August
due to weakening inflationary pressures and signs of an economic
slowdown.
   But Seiders says the bond market might have reacted prematurely
about changes in the economy, which in turn could mean higher
interest rates in the near future.
   ``We believe that inflation pressures are still building and that
the Fed (Federal Reserve) might not be willing to accept that,'' he
said. ``Oil prices, of course, are a real wildcard.''
   Many economists are forecasting inflation of around 4 percent
this year and about a percentage point higher in 1989.
   Another factor that might be keeping rates lower, according to
George A. Christie, chief economist with the F.W. Dodge Division of
McGraw-Hill Information Systems Co., is that mortgage volume is down.
   ``What I find significant from all this is that (mortgage) rates
are about a half (percentage) point higher than the start of the
year, but home sales are still good,'' he said.

<HEAD>New Insider Trading Indictment Suggests Mutual Tip Purloining</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The latest Wall Street insider trading indictment
suggests a gang of white-collar thieves who not only stole sensitive
information from clients to profit in the stock market, but also
purloined tips from each other.
   The multiple-count indictment announced Wednesday by the U.S.
attorney's office alleged that two small investment firms and three
trading professionals _ including a researcher for troubled Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. _ schemed with others who have been previously
charged.
   It also alleged previously undisclosed links between Drexel, the
so-called Yuppie Five insider trading ring exposed two years ago and
Ivan F. Boesky, the imprisoned speculator who turned state's
evidence after paying the government a record $100 million fine for
insider trading in November 1986.
   One of the allegations asserted that an unidentified trader in
Boesky's now-defunct firm _ who wasn't charged and apparently is a
cooperating government witness _ stole tips from Boesky and shared
them with other co-conspirators.
   If so, it suggests that while Boesky was using stolen or bought
tips to trade for himself, others were stealing from him.
   The indictment also cast a new cloud over Drexel, which is
fighting other civil fraud charges by the Securities and Exchange
Commission stemming from its relationship with Boesky and is the
target of a federal grand jury probe.
   The latest charges largely are an outgrowth of the Yuppie Five
case, in which four young investment professionals and an attorney
confessed to charges of stealing secret information about takeovers
from clients and using it to profit in the stock market. Those five,
already sentenced in the earlier charges, have been cooperating with
federal investigators.
   Accused in the Wednesday indictment were Marcus Schloss & Co. and
Victor Teicher & Co., small investment firms in Manhattan. Also
accused were D. Ronald Yagoda, 44, head of arbitrage trading at
Marcus Schloss; Victor Teicher, 37, head of Teicher; and Ross
Frankel, 32, head of arbitrage research at Drexel.
   Through their attorneys, all the defendants denied any wrongdoing
and vowed to fight the charges in court. They are scheduled to
formally enter their pleas Nov. 10.
   The indictment accused the defendants of participating in an
insider trading ring with the Yuppie Five and the unidentified
trader for Boesky, using non-public information about Union Carbide
Corp., American Can Corp., Allegheny Inc., Avondale Mills and
American Brands Inc. to trade profitably in the stocks of those
companies.
   The indictment also alleged that Frankel improperly funneled to
Teicher the identities of four companies on Drexel's so-called
confidential ``phantom list,'' identifying potential targets of
takeovers the firm might finance. The indictment identified the
companies as Republic Airlines Inc., Westchester Financial Services
Corp., Western Union Corp. and Warnaco Inc.
   The defendants face varying counts of securities fraud, mail
fraud, wire fraud, perjury and obstruction of an SEC investigation.
   Drexel, moving quickly to distance itself from this new source of
potential trouble, said in a statement that Frankel had taken a
temporary leave of absence to devote his efforts to fighting the
charges.
   ``Today's indictment of Ross Frankel is disturbing,'' said Drexel
spokesman Steven Anreder. ``It would be unfair to prejudge the case
or comment at this time.''
   Yagoda's lawyer, Stanley S. Arkin, suggested his client was
indicted because of a plea agreement between federal prosecutors and
Andrew Solomon, a former Schloss apprentice and a member of the
Yuppie Five ring.
   Schloss stated that it ``believes itself innocent of any
wrongdoing and will accordingly vigorously contest these charges in
due course.''
   Robert G. Morvillo, Teicher's attorney, said his client
``emphasized most strongly that he never violated those laws and is
confident that his innocence will be established at trial.''
   Yagoda was accused of 10 counts, Teicher 22 counts and Frankel
seven counts. Each faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison
and a $250,000 fine for each count.
   Schloss was accused of eight counts and Teicher's firm 22 counts.
Both face a maximum fine of $500,000 for each count.

   Auto mechanic Ben DeRosier and his wife
Doris sat in the lobby of The Sharper Image's corporate office,
waiting to convince a product buyer their electric fingernail file
is a retailer's dream come true.
   ``I work in an office where all the girls are into long
nails...and after using this the nails are so smooth you can run
them down your stockings without causing even the tiniest snag,
something I'd never do after the beauty parlor,'' Doris DeRosier
said Wednesday.
   The couple were among the small crowd of inventors who every
month, gizmos in hand, get their foot in the door of the high-tech
gadget purveyor in hopes of getting their product into the company's
mail-order catalog.
   In search of unique merchandise, The Sharper Image for two years
has held open house on the first Wednesday of every month. About 35
inventors a month come from across the country to attend, including
some manufacturers offering exclusive rights to their products.
   About one in 50 products are taken under consideration. So far,
three open house items have made it into the company's 63 stores and
into its 2.5 million monthly catalogs.
   Devices rejected include a vacuum cleaner attachment that cuts
hair by sucking it into the hose and chopping it off at a pre-set
length; rotating sheets of wallpaper; and the ``Beauty Pillow,''
with a hole cut for the face in order to eliminate wrinkles.
   But there have been successes. Coming later this fall is the
BugVac _ the brainchild of Larry Volle, of Roseville _ a miniature
vacuum cleaner that ends the messy task of cleaning up dead pests.
   And a big hit has been the ``ShowerTek,'' a shaving mirror that
doesn't fog up in the bathroom. nearly 70,000 have been sold since
its inventor brought it in last year.
   The ShowerTek, now one of The Sharper Image's best-selling
products, was pooh-poohed by company president Richard Thalheimer _
until he took it home and tried it himself. Hot water circulating
from the shower head to behind the mirror keeps it fog free.
   While many inventors struggle for years to get an audience with
major manufacturers, Sharper Image decided to cut through the
bureaucracy.
   ``This represents the good old American dream, that if you've got
something you really believe in, you can come in and make your
pitch,'' said Doris DeRosier.
   The Sharper Image, which had sales of $160 million last year, is
known for innovation in both marketing and the selection of gifts.
Some of the more unusual ones include a $1,600 programmable home
robot, talking bathroom scales, suits of armor and even a $2,000
remote-controlled toy helicopter.
   The business was started in 1977 by then-attorney Thalheimer, who
started out selling digital stopwatches through the mail with ads in
running magazines.
   The company went public in April 1987. But Thalheimer, 40, runs
it much like a family firm, reserving for himself the final say on
all products.
   Among the new ideas he's got to decide on are battery-powered,
blinking earrings in the shapes of circles, triangles and squares,
designed by David LeBlanc of Atlantis Productions of Santa Rosa.
   As for the DeRosiers, The Sharper Image told them it would
consider carrying their electric fingernail file if they find a
manufacturer.

<HEAD>Dollar Down, Gold Still Rising</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar was lower against most major
currencies in European trading this morning but psychological
support and an absence of economic news checked continued selling
pressure.
   Gold prices continued to rise, benefiting from a rally on
platinum triggered by tight supplies.
   Foreign exchange dealers said early trading was thin and nervous.
They said the failure this week of several rounds of interventions
by the Bank of Japan and the U.S. Federal Reserve to push the dollar
higher had created selling pressure.
   But later in the morning, the dollar was holding steady,
supported by psychological factors and an absence of major economic
indicators, they said.
   Market players generally expect the dollar to trade within a
narrow range until after the U.S. presidential elections next
Tuesday.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.7802 to buy one pound, more expensive for buyers than $1.7740
late Wednesday.
   Other mid-morning dollar rates compared with Wednesday's late
rates, included: 1.7725 West German marks, down from 1.7840; 1.4882
Swiss francs, down from 1.4975; 6.0160 French francs, down from
6.0885; 1.9984 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0193; 1,318.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,322.00; and 1.2235 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2275.
   In Tokyo, banks and financial markets were closed due to a
national holiday. In London, the dollar was trading at 124.45 yen,
down from the dollar's closing of 124.68 yen in Tokyo on Wednesday.
   In London, gold opened at a bid price of $420.50, up from
Wednesday's late bid price of $417.20 a troy ounce. London's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of $422.90 a
troy ounce at midmorning.
   In Zurich, it rose to $422.90 bid from $417 bid late Wednesday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid $422.99, up from
$413.90 bid at Wednesday's close.
   Silver bullion was trading in London at a bid price of $6.51 a
troy ounce, up from $6.45 bid late Wednesday.

   Pillsbury Co.'s board of directors was
scheduled to meet today, but officials at the food and restaurant
company refused to say whether the board would announce a plan to
defend against the $5.23 billion takeover bid from Britain's Grand
Metropolitan PLC.
   Pillsbury's directors have already rejected the $60-a-share offer
and Chairman Philip Smith said shareholders would be informed of an
alternative before the tender offer expires on Tuesday.
   Pillsbury spokesman Larry Haeg would not disclose the time and
location of the regularly scheduled meeting. He said Pillsbury
officials have not met with Grand Met to discuss the offer.
   A group of dissident shareholders is suing Pillsbury to force the
company to negotiate the offer or come up with an alternative of
equal or greater value.
   Hennepin County District Court Judge Thomas Carey on Wednesday
granted a request by the dissident group that all shareholders be
represented as a class in the lawsuit.
   The class of Pillsbury shareholders in the lawsuit includes all
those who owned the stock before Oct. 17, the date Pillsbury's
directors rejected the tender offer. Over objections from Pillsbury,
Carey excluded Grand Met from the shareholder's group although the
company owned Pillsbury stock as early as August.
   Had Grand Met been included in the class, it would have been
enjoined from taking legal action against Pillsbury in other states.
   Steven Rothschild, a lawyer for Pillsbury, asked for Grand Met to
be included in the class to prevent the British conglomerate from
``getting two bites at winning.''
   ``Don't subject us to the multiple hits they are trying to
inflict on us,'' Rothschild said in court.
   But Carey said Grand Met has interests that are different than
the interests of shareholders.
   Carey also denied a request from Pillsbury that the shareholders'
lawsuit be dismissed.
   Similar legal action is pending in Delaware, where Pillsbury is
incorporated.
   In a suit separate from the shareholders' action, Pillsbury has
asked Carey to block the tender offer on grounds the proposed
takeover would violate state laws that forbid liquor distillers from
selling alcohol at retail outlets.
   Grand Met makes a variety of alcoholic beverages including J&B
Scotch. Pillsbury sells liquor at its Steak & Ale and Bennigan's
restaurants.
   Pillsbury stock closed Wednesday at $61.50, up 25 cents a share
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

<NOTE>Eds: Rewrites thruout with Kohlberg Kravis merger invalidated. No

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British publisher Robert Maxwell has emerged the
apparent victor in the takeover battle for Macmillan Inc. after a
Delaware court invalidated Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.'s merger
pact with the publishing and infomation services company.
   In a ruling Wednesday, a three-judge panel of the Delaware
Supreme Court reversed a Delaware Chancery Court judgment that last
month affirmed the $2.5 billion agreement between Macmillan and
Kohlberg Kravis.
   Maxwell is offering $2.51 billion for Macmillan.
   The court also ordered the lower court to issue a preliminary
injunction against a merger with Kohlberg Kravis. The ruling came
two weeks after Mcamillan lost a separate court challenge to its
``poison pill'' anti-takeover defense.
   At issue Wednesday was a so-called ``lock-up'' provision in the
Kohlberg Kravis deal that had given the powerful New York buyout
firm the right to buy certain prize Macmillan assets for $865
million if the publishing and information company is acquired by
another suitor.
   The provision, which was put in place in September, was intended
to discourage rival suitors, such as Maxwell, who likely would be
unwilling to buy Macmillan without those choice properties.
   Maxwell had contended that the lock-up, which covered Macmillan's
Berlitz language centers, the directory division, the direct
marketing division and a division that publishes state legal codes,
was unfair and would leave the company with a $250 million tax
liability.
   ``I am delighted by the court's decision which should clear the
way for our acquisition of Macmillan,'' Maxwell said in a statement
after the ruling.
   He also stated he had met with Macmillan Chairman Edward P. Evans
and other members of the management team on Wednesday. ``(I) am
pleased by their willingness to cooperate with me in ensuring an
orderly transition,'' he said.
   Spokesmen for Kohlberg Kravis, which also is making an
unprecedented $20.3 billion bid for RJR Nabisco Inc., were
unavailable for comment after the ruling.
   Both Maxwell and Kohlberg Kravis have outstanding tender offers
that expire at 12:01 a.m. Friday for Macmillan's 27.8 million
outstanding shares.
   Experts say Maxwell virtually is guaranteed to win a bidding
contest because his all-cash $90.25 a share bid is higher than the
$90.05 a share cash-and-securities offer from Kohlberg Kravis, which
has been endorsed by Macmillan.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Macmillan jumped $1.25
to $89.50 a share on Wednesday.
   The state supreme court decision came after a 2{-hour hearing in
which attorneys for Maxwell Communication Corp. PLC also argued that
Macmillan tainted the bidding process by revealing Maxwell's bid to
Kohlberg Kravis while withholding information on the offer from its
own board.
   Justice Andrew G.T. Moore II described Macmillan management's
defense against charges of improper bidding as sounding ``like
something I have read in Lewis Carroll,'' author of ``Alice in
Wonderland.''
   ``The process was tainted ... (because) information to the
(Macmillan) board was not accurate or complete ... it was misleading
in lack of candor,'' said Moore.
   Earlier this month, Assistant Chancellor Jack B. Jacobs issued a
injunction Oct. 17 prohibiting Macmillan's poison-pill defense, in
which Macmillan would have diluted the value of its stock.
   After that ruling, Maxwell appealed to the higher court to obtain
a court order against Macmillan's other dealings with Kohlberg
Kravis.

<TEXT>
   South Korea's trade surplus with the
United States in the first nine months of this year declined 13.2
percent from a year ago, while its trade deficit with Japan fell 30
percent, the Korea Foreign Trade Association reported Thursday.
   The association said, however, that Korea's trade surplus with
the European Economic Community increased 16.6 percent during the
January-September period.
   The shifts in Korea's trade patterns with the United States and
Japan were attributed partly to its policy of buying more American
goods at the sacrifice of some of its imports from Japan.
   Under the policy designed to ease trade friction with America,
Seoul has eased its import restrictions on some American products
and somewhat revalued the Korean won currency against the dollar.
   Officials said Korea's trade surplus with the United States in
the nine months shrank 13.2 percent to $6.01 billion from $6.92
billion a year earlier.
   Korea's global trade surplus was $5.13 billion on exports of
$42.95 billion and imports of $37.82 billion, according to an
earlier government report.
   Korean exports to the United States were listed at $15.15
billion, up 14.3 percent from a year ago, and imports from the
United States were $9.14 billion, up 44.3 percent.
   Korea ran a deficit of $2.95 billion with Japan in the nine
months, down 30 percent from a year ago. Korean exports to Japan
jumped 48.6 percent to $8.54 billion and its imports from Japan grew
15.4 percent to $11.49 billion.

<HEAD>Brazil Completes Signing Of New Financial Package With World Banks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brazil, the biggest Third World debtor, and its
creditor banks have completed a previously announced $82 billion
financial package.
   In a communique issued Wednesday, both sides said the
unprecedented accord brought Brazil up to date on its interest
payments ``for the first time since February 1987, thereby fully
normalizing its relations with the international financial
community.''
   The pact, signed in September, covers about two thirds of
Brazil's foreign debt, which at $121 billion represents about one
tenth of all Third World external debt, estimated at $1.2 trillion.
   Included in the package is $5.2 billion in new money to help
Brazil cover its external financing needs for 1987, 1988, and the
first half of 1989. It also contains $3.6 billion in co-financing
and parallel financing with the World Bank, $1 billion in new-money
bonds, and a $600 million medium-term loan. Brazil had suspended
interest payments on its foreign bank debt for about a year starting
in February 1987 and had been making partial payments this year.
   William R. Rhodes, vice president of Citibank of New York and
head of the 16-bank negotiating committee, said more than 300 banks
participated in the package.
   He said the syndication, which began in late June and ended
Monday, was the fastest of any major new-money and restructuring
package since the international debt crisis began six years ago.
   Rhodes said that Brazil will be able to make its first drawdown
of the new loans _ about $4 billion _ within the next two weeks.

<DATELINE>WEST POINT, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Point-Pepperell Inc.'s board of
directors has rejected as inadequate a $1.4 billion takeover bid by
Chicago-based Farley Inc., saying Pepperell's value will jump when
it consolidates operations with the recently acquired J.P. Stevens &
Co.
   ``The company really, really is not for sale and our
overwhelmingly desire is to remain independent,'' Don Keller,
president of the Georgia-based textile giant, said Wednesday.
   At a meeting in New York, Pepperell's board voted unanimously to
reject the $48 a share offer from Farley, a privately-held
conglomerate that owns the company that makes Fruit of the Loom
underwear.
   The announcement came after the stock market closed. In trading
on the New York Stock Exchange, Pepperell slipped 25 cents a share
to $45.25.
   William F. Farley, the chairman of Farley Inc., issued a
statement saying he believed the $48 a share offer was fair and its
acceptance by the board would be in the best interest of Pepprell's
shareholders.
   But Keller said the Pepperell board rejected it on the advice of
its financial advisers plus other considerations.
   The board believed Pepperell's stock price would rise
dramatically once the company integrated its Stevens assets and
began to realize the operating efficiencies available to a combined
operation, Keller said.
   Pepperell, which manufactures Arrow shirts and Martex towels,
purchased Stevens in May for $1.2 billion and then split up Stevens'
assets with a rival suitor. Pepperell was left with most of Stevens'
linen and towel operations, giving the company about 25 percent of
the nation's home fashion textile market.
   The Stevens assets must be held separately until early December
under an agreement with the Federal Trade Commission, he said.
   Pepperell's board ``believes that the Farley offer is an
opportunistic attempt to capture the long-term value of the company
at an inadequate price before the advantages of the Stevens
acquisition can be realized and appropriately reflected in the
market price of the shares,'' said Joseph L. Lanier Jr., chairman
and chief executive officer for Pepperell.
   The board authorized Pepperell's management to explore
alternatives to the Farley offer. But Lanier said in a statement
there is no assurance that the exploration will result in any
transaction being recommended to the board.
   Part of the reasoning behind rejection of Farley's offer is that
Farley ``has indicated he would bust up the company'' if the
takeover succeeds, Keller said.
   ``We believe that West Point, which has been operating in these
communities for years, needs to stay there,'' Keller said, referring
to the company's textile mills and plants in mostly small, rural
communities in Georgia and elsewhere in the South.
   In material filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in
Washington, Farley said that, if successful in its bid, it plans to
sell Pepperell's apparel fabrics and industrial fabrics businesses
and keep the household fabrics business.
   Farley notified Pepperell in May it was seeking up to 25 percent
of Pepperell's 29.4 million outstanding shares and, as of last week,
had spent $88 million for 9.8 percent of the stock.
   Pepperell immediately began taking steps to strengthen its
ability to fight a takeover, including adoption of a poison pill
defense that would make a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive.
   Pepperell also has had in place for some time so-called ``golden
parachutes'' for executives, including a $1.39 million payout to
Lanier if he were to be fired by new owners. Farley has challenged
those provisions in federal court.

   The stock market was higher early today at the
start of what is expected to be another quiet session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 7.64 points at
2,164.47 after a half-hour of trading at 10 a.m. EST.
   Advancing issues edged out declining ones by around 5 to 3 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 549 issues up, 352 down and 508
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 22.86 million shares.
   Through most of this week, trading has been dampened by the
market's anticipation of upcoming events: notably Friday's release
of U.S. unemployment data for October and the presidential election
next Tuesday.
   Stocks have come under some pressure from the dollar's persistent
decline in recent days, which has raised fears that the Federal
Reserve could bolster the U.S. currency by nudging interest rates
higher.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks had
edged up 0.24 to 157.24.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was up
0.09 at 299.92.
   On Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 5.87 points
to 2,156.83.
   Declining issues edged out advances by around 4 to 3 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 842 issues down, 598 up and 543 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 161.30 million shares, up from 151.25

   Officers of Holly Farms Corp. urged the
company's stockholders today to reject a roughly $940 million buyout
offer from rival poultry processor Tyson Foods Inc. of Springdale,
Ark.
   ``The offer is inadequate and not in the best interests of the
company and its stockholders,'' Holly Farms' board of directors said
in a statement.
   Tyson, the nation's largest poultry processor, is offering $52 a
share in cash for Holly Farms. The board of Holly Farms last month
rejected a previous Tyson offer, which consisted of $45 a share plus
a quarter share of Tyson stock for each of Holly Farms' 1.8 million
shares of Class A common stock.
   ``The board has authorized management together with the company's
financial and legal advisers to continue to explore alternatives to
Tyson Foods' offer in order to maximize value of the company's
stockholders,'' Holly Farms said.
   Holly Farms, based in Memphis, is a diversified food company with
about 50 percent of its sales in chicken. Tyson Foods produces 14
million pounds of chicken meat a week.

<HEAD>Lyng Says He'll Stay On Job Until Reagan Leaves</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said
today he intends to stay on the job until the next administration
takes over Jan. 20.
   ``I'm going to be fairly busy up until the end of the year and
then for 20 days in January,'' Lyng said, adding that he had turned
down a number of speaking invitations. ``It would seem that in the
last two or three weeks (on the job) I might be of some help to my
successor.''
   Lyng had already passed the word to senior staff people that he
``has some unfinished work'' to do concerning trade talks and that
he and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter will be busy
tidying up those affairs over the next few weeks, regardless of how
the presidential election turns out Tuesday.
   A special meeting of the 96 member countries of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, at which agriculture will be a
central focus, is scheduled to begin in Montreal on Dec. 5, for
example.
   Lyng also said that he wants to take some vacation time to be
with his family and then return to USDA for more work and a round of
farewells before bowing out.
   But gossip has persisted that if George Bush wins the election
Lyng may be prevailed upon to resign and head up a GOP transition
team at USDA, a job he did when Ronald Reagan won the White House
eight years ago.
   Lyng, 70, has said publicly for months that he plans to retire
when Reagan leaves office in January but had not spelled out what
role he might play in the event Bush wins the presidency.
   In an interview today, Lyng discounted rumors of resigning early
to head a Bush transition team.
   ``I don't think that would make much sense,'' Lyng said. ``I'm
here, and if they want me to help, I would.''
   The USDA rumor mill was provided additional grist this week. On
Tuesday, it was announced that David C. Lyons, Lyng's executive
assistant, will resign effective in ``late November'' and will go to
work in the private sector.
   Also, a monthly calendar of coming events involving USDA
officials showed that Lyng has several speaking engagements booked
through November but none after that. His last appearance before a
USDA group was shown as Nov. 29 at the department's annual outlook
conference.
   The calendar included the 70th annual meeting of the American
Farm Bureau Federation in San Antonio, Texas, on Jan. 8-12, but no
USDA participant was listed. A federation spokesman, John Lewis,
said Lyng is not on the program but ``would be welcome if he showed
up.''
   Lyng, a longtime friend of Reagan's, has been through the
revolving job door at USDA several times and is intimately
acquainted with agency functions, needs and the political byways of
departmental bureaucracy.
   In early 1969, when he was head of the California Department of
Agriculture and Reagan was governor, Lyng was named by President
Nixon as assistant secretary of agriculture for consumer and
marketing services, a job he held for four years.
   From 1973 to 1979, Lyng was president of the industry supported
American Meat Institute and worked for Reagan's 1980 presidential
campaign. As head of the transition team, Lyng helped ease the way
for John R. Block to take over as secretary of agriculture.
   Lyng became deputy secretary, the No. 2 job in the department. He
resigned in 1985 to establish his own consulting firm but returned
to USDA as secretary in March 1986 after Block's resignation.
   It is unclear who would succeed Lyng if Bush were elected.
Yeutter has been mentioned frequently as the leading candidate and
has expressed interest in the USDA job. However, some feel that Bush
might want Yeutter to stay on as U.S. trade representative, at least
for a while.
   Former Iowa congressman Cooper Evans, an early supporter of Bush,
is rated highly by some as a likely secretary of agriculture.
   Another on the GOP list of possibles is Robert Delano, Warsaw,
Va., a former president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, who
also has been active in the Bush-Quayle farm campaign.
   Secretaries of agriculture from the South have been rare,
according to USDA historian Doug Bowers. John A. Knebel from
Virginia, who succeeded Earl L. Butz for a brief period at the end
of 1976 and into January 1977, was the most recent _ and only
Southerner, if border state Missouri isn't counted.
   Four Missourians were secretaries of agriculture, the most recent
being Arthur Hyde in 1929-33, a former Missouri governor.
   Still another potential GOP choice is the department's current
No. 2 official, Deputy Secretary Peter Myers _ and he is also from
Missouri.

<HEAD>Baker Hughes Scraps Sale of Local Divisions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Baker Hughes Inc. has taken its BJ-Titan Services
and BJ Services International divisions off the market, citing
disappointingly low bids for the two pressure pumping businesses.
   Baker Hughes had announced in June it would sell the two Houston
divisions, which analysts had valued at about $200 million, as part
of its strategy to focus on core businesses in which it is a market
leader.
   Company president Jim Woods said in early October that Baker
Hughes had received three or four serious bids and was negotiating
with one of the bidders. But he declined to identify the firm or the
price.
   BJ-Titan and BJ Services International provide acidizing,
cementing and fracturing services used to complete and start
production from oil and natural gas wells. The divisions employ
about 2,600 people worldwide.
   Woods said in a statement Wednesday that ``with the deterioration
and uncertainty in international oil prices, the proposed purchase
prices of the divisions were below the company's expectations.''
   The company said it would continue to operate the two businesses
as usual and has no current plans to seek other bids.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures were modestly higher on
follow-through buying from Wednesday's strong rally while grain
futures were mixed in early trading today on the Chicago Board of
Trade.
   Soybeans for delivery in November leaped 18{ cents a bushel
Wednesday on rumors of substantial Soviet purchases of U.S.
soybeans, analysts said.
   After Wednesday's close, the Agriculture Department confirmed
that the Soviets had bought 250,000 metric tons of U.S. soybeans,
their first soybean purchase for delivery in the marketing year that
began Sept. 1.
   Bullish traders welcomed the news but analysts noted that the
pace of Soviet buying of U.S. grains was well below last year's
level.
   ``The market's pretty evenly divided,'' said Cathy Leow, a grain
markets analyst with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York.
``Some people are very bullish'' based on the Soviet buying, ``but
others think (the soybean runup) is a seasonal, post-harvest rally.''
   Wheat was narrowly mixed and corn was a little lower due to a
lack of confirmation of rumored Russian buying of those commodities,
analysts said.
   In early trading, wheat was 1\ cents lower to 1 cent higher with
the contract for delivery in December at $4.17{ a bushel; corn was {
cent to 1} cents lower with December at $2.84} a bushel; oats were 1
cent to 3 cents lower with December at $2.27} a bushel; soybeans
were { cent to 3 cents higher with November at $7.97{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly lower while pork futures were mixed in
early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .25 cent lower to .05 cent higher with December
at 73.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .30 cent
lower with November at 81.65 cents a pound; live hogs were .12 cent
lower to .10 cent higher with December at 41.85 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .10 cent lower to .55 cent higher with
February at 47.40 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly higher on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia reported that locusts
were still invading its west coast Thursday and that weather
conditions would drive more across the Red Sea.
   But a major combat operation in motion since the first attack
Oct. 13 prevented the crop-devouring insects from penetrating the
interior of the kingdom, said a press statement from the Ministry of
Agriculture.
   ``The situation is reassuring at present and the ministry is
taking all effective measures to bar the locusts from moving toward
the Arab states,'' said the statement.
   In recent days, locust swarms were reported in Iraq, Iran,
northern Kuwait and in the central gulf around Bahrain and Qatar.
These countries have been on the alert with their own combat squads
and pesticides. All have reported the situation is under control.
   In Bahrain a ``hotline'' has been established to report sightings.
   Said Hassan Abdul-Karim, director of farmer services at the
Bahraini ministry of agriculture, ``The situation is all under
control. There is nothing now and the country is almost clean. Our
people have been surveying ... and there's nothing so far. ''
   Instructions circulated in Bahrain and the other countries have
not failed to remind residents not to pick the locusts for eating,
since they are considered a delicacy. Once sprayed, the locusts
become poisonous, said the instructions circulated through the media.
   The locust invasion which blew across the Red Sea from the east
African coast is believed the worst in 25 years.
   The Saudi statement said rainfall along an 875-mile stretch of
its Red Sea coast had helped the infestation while weather
conditions over Turkey produced north and northeasterly winds
``which might lead to continuation of the swarms reaching the
kingdom till November.''
   It said hundreds of ground squads equipped with sprayers and
insecticides and assisted by aerial squadrons arrested the locust
penetration into the interior ``and yet more swarms of the desert
locusts are still reaching the kingdom.''
   More swarms were also expected in light of the reports by the
World Food and Agriculture Organization which said that the locusts
were widespread in the Sudan and that the situation was critical and
deteriorating in Sudan, Mauritania, Mali, Senegal, Niger and Gambia.

   The stock market was higher in moderate trading
early today, buoyed by the dollar's steadiness after a recent steep
decline.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 12.62 points at
2,169.45 at noon EST, after rising gradually through the trading
session.
   Much of the advance was said to come from a surge in Sears
Roebuck, one of the components of the blue-chip indicator.
   Sears shares had soared 2{ to 45{, bolstered by unconfirmed
rumors that investor Ronald Perelman is poised to make a bid for the
giant retailer. Sears announced a major restructuring on Monday.
   Advancing issues edged out declining ones by around 6 to 5 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 664 issues up, 552 down and 592
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 74.53 million shares, up from
73.38 million traded by the same time on Wednesday.
   Stocks have come under some pressure from the dollar's persistent
decline in recent days, which has raised fears that the Federal
Reserve could bolster the U.S. currency by nudging interest rates
higher.
   The dollar stabilized in foreign-exchange trading early today,
giving a lift to stock prices.
   ``The tone seems to be better,'' said Jack Baker, the head of
block trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   He noted, however, that activity continues to be dominated by
professional traders, with many institutional investors staying on
the sidelines.
   Through most of this week, trading has been dampened by the
market's anticipation of upcoming events: notably Friday's release

next Tuesday.

   Federal regulators are expected to order
MCorp to inject about $400 million into its troubled bank
subsidiaries, a move that will likely push the holding company into
bankruptcy court, reports published Thursday said.
   The Fort Worth Star-Telegram and the Wall Street Journal said the
Comptroller of the Currency notified most of MCorp's 25 banks last
week that it intends to demand they raise more capital.
   The Federal Reserve Board also ordered MCorp to draft a plan to
boost its banks' capital, the reports said.
   The $400 million amount was mentioned by both federal agencies,
along with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures bank
deposits, they said.
   MCorp had no comment on the reports, spokesman George McCane said
Thursday. However, sources told the newspapers MCorp will file for
protection under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws if it
receives a permanent order for a cash transfer.
   ``If there is a direct order, or if certain events or actions by
regulators show that their intention is to order MCorp to move the
money, that would be interpreted as a reason for the company to seek
the protection of an independent referee,'' the Star-Telegram's
source said.
   MCorp, the second-largest bank holding company in Texas, posted a
record $517 million loss for the third quarter.
   MCorp has asked for federal help in a management-led
reorganization that would include $400 million from the holding
company, $400 million raised from private investors and shareholders
and an undetermined amount from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
Analysts estimate the FDIC would have to provide about $1 billion.

<TEXT>
   New York City filed suit today on behalf of
several big cities and minority groups to force the Census Bureau to
make adjustments to avoid large-scale undercounting in the 1990
census.
   ``Some people are, in effect, being disenfranchised by an
undercount,'' said Peter Zimroth, the city's lawyer. Congressional
seats and some federal, state and city funds are allocated on the
basis of population.
   Zimroth said New York City was undercounted by about 500,000 in
1980, and he predicted the 1990 census as now planned would be even
less accurate.
   Undercounting often affects minorities and illegal aliens,
because many do not respond to the mailed census forms, he said.
   The suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, which has
a large black population and could be vastly undercounted, Zimroth
said.
   Joining in the action were Los Angeles and Chicago; Dade County,
Fla., which includes Miami; the state of California; the U.S.
Conference of Mayors; the National League of Cities; the League of
United Latin American Citizens, and the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.
   New York won a suit for an undercount adjustment after the 1980
census, but the victory was overturned by a federal appeals court
after the government argued it was not possible to make an accurate
sampling because of technicalities.
   Zimroth said the bureau had since worked out the technical
difficulties.

<HEAD>Pioneer Seed Corn Prices Rise An Average 11.8 Percent, Drought
Blamed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN P. ROSENFELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's largest producer of seed corn
said Thursday it would raise its prices an average 11.8 percent for
next spring's sales to farmers, reflecting the increased cost of
replacing its drought-damaged U.S. crop.
   ``This should be good news to those who've heard rumors that
Pioneer seed corn would be selling for well over $100 a bag,''
Charles S. Johnson, senior vice president for Pioneer Hi-Bred
International Inc.'s North American operations, said in a prepared
statement announcing the price increases.
   Pioneer said it would increase the price of an average bag of
seed corn $7.39, which would bring the cost to about $70. But
because of the wide variety of seed Pioneer sells, some farmers
still will pay less and some will pay more.
   Based on the average increase announced, a farmer would spend
about $220 more next spring than last for each 100 acres planted if
he used a Pioneer variety that is designed to seed 3.4 acres per bag.
   Pioneer seed corn is sold in packages ranging from 60,000 kernels
a bag to 110,000 kernels, and the company said most increases will
range from $5 to $10 a bag.
   ``The reason for the increase is very heavily related to the
drought,'' Pioneer spokesman Dave Knau said in an interview.
   The blistering summer of 1988 shriveled Pioneer's harvest of corn
grown for farm seed to little more than half of what it had planned
to grow, Knau said. As a result, the company had to plan winter
production _ half of it spread through the states of Arizona,
California, Florida and Texas and half in the South American
countries of Argentina and Chile.
   ``Winter production is very expensive,'' Knau said.
   But he said Pioneer believes the increase will be kept from
growing larger because the outlook for the winter harvest looks good
and because it was able to carry over unsold seed corn from previous
harvests equivalent to 57 percent of last spring's sales.
   In addition, Pioneer and others are forecasting stepped up sales
for 1989 plantings because the government, in response to drought
damage suffered by farmers, will not require corngrowers to leave as
much land idle as they did this year to qualify for federal
subsidies.
   Knau said the prices for 1989 seed were announced a few weeks
later than usual because company officials had to factor in winter
production. He also said the company may slightly reduce 1989
spending on advertising or on premium giveaways to promote sales.
   But he said the company will continue to offer discounts of 1
percent to 14 percent based on the dollar volume of sales and
discounts ranging from 2 percent to 7 percent for orders paid for in
advance.
   Johnson said the company is projecting that nearly one-fourth of
its supply for next spring will be in five new hybrids that
``demonstrated a strong performance advantage over the competition
this past growing season, even with the drought.'' Those hybrids are
designated 3751, 3585, 3379, 3343 and 3140.

<TEXT>
   Tyson Foods Inc. defended its $52-a-share
buyout offer of Holly Farms Corp. Thursday hours after officers of
Holly Farms urged the company's stockholders to reject the roughly
$940 million bid.
   Jim Blair, a spokesman for the Springdale-based poultry
processor, said that Holly Farms probably won't find a better offer.
   ``We think that our offer is more than anyone else will pay,''
Blair said. ``They now recognize that Holly Farms is for sale. The
question is to whom, for how much.''
   But the board of the Memphis, Tenn., company disagreed.
   ``The offer is inadequate and not in the best interest of the
company and its stockholders,'' Holly Farms' board of directors said
in a statement released Thursday.
   ``The board has authorized management together with the company's
financial and legal advisors to continue to explore alternatives to
Tyson Foods' offer in order to maximize value of the company's
stockholders,'' Holly Farms said.
   Last month, Holly Farms rejected a Tyson offer of $45 plus a
quarter share of Tyson stock for each of Holly Farms' 1.8 million
shares of Class A common stock.
   Speculation over Holly Farms' decision caused the firm's stock to
climb above Tyson's offer. The stock closed at $53.25 on Tuesday and
$52.88 on Wednesday.
   ``Obviously, the market right now is telling us that it believes
that a higher bid will come to the table than Tyson's current $52
bid,'' said Napoleon Overton, an analyst with Morgan Keegan & Co.,
in Memphis. Overton downplayed Wednesday's stock decline.
   ``Stocks in play tend to be quite volatile within a reasonable
narrow range around the bids that are on the table,'' he said.
   John McMillin, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities in New
York, said he thinks Holly Farms is looking for a white knight ``and
again if they can't find a white knight, they'll come out with their
own recapitalization program and sell it to Don Tyson as a last
resort.''
   Tyson had stepped up its efforts to acquire Holly Farms by
sending to shareholders tender offers made through the Holly
Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tyson.
   Tyson is the nation's largest poultry producer, churning out 14
million pounds of chicken meat a week. Holly Farms is a diversified
food company and the nation's third largest chicken company.
   Tyson's offer is good until Nov. 18.

<HEAD>Grand Jury Charges Securities Firm and Its Chief With Manipulation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investment firm and its founder were indicted
today on stock manipulation and other securities fraud charges in
connection with the sale of Fireman's Fund Corp. shares by American
Express Co. more than two years ago.
   The multiple-count indictment by the federal grand jury against
Salim B. Lewis and S.B. Lewis & Co. was an indirect outgrowth of the
Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal, and federal prosecutors said
others might be charged.
   U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani told reporters the indictment
alleges that Lewis and other unidentified co-conspirators attempted
to manipulate upward the price of Fireman's Fund stock on May 8,
1986, the day American Express was to price an offering of Fireman's
Fund securities it wished to sell.
   ``One of the objects of the conspiracy was to make sure that
American Express maximized the proceeds that it received from that
offering,'' Giuliani said.
   Lewis, 49, is said to have a close relationship with American
Express, one of the biggest financial services companies and parent
of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., a leading Wall Street firm.
   Federal prosecutors would not elaborate on whether anybody inside
American Express played a role in the alleged conspiracy.
   Giuliani said some of the information for the indictment was
provided by Boyd L. Jefferies, a Los Angeles investment professional
who settled government charges of securities fraud in 1987 in
exchange for his cooperation in other investigations.
   Jefferies was exposed by Boesky, the most famous insider trader
in U.S. history. Now imprisoned, Boesky also is cooperating with the
government.
   A person answering the telephone at Lewis's New York office said
he was not available. Telephone messages left on his home answering
machine in Short Hills, N.J., were not immediately returned.
   American Express spokesman Lawrence A. Armour declined to comment
on the indictment, saying the company had not yet seen a copy of it.

   The management of RJR Nabisco Inc. today raised
the price tag on the largest corporate buyout in U.S. history,
announcing a nearly $21 billion cash and stock bid that tops an
earlier offer by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. for the food and
tobacco giant.
   R. Ross Johnson, president and chief executive officer of RJR
Nabisco, said in a two-paragraph statement that the management group
and its financial partners, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Salomon
Inc., would offer stockholders $84 in cash and $8 worth of
securities for each Nabisco share outstanding.
   ``This is a full and fair price for stockholders,'' Johnson said.
``Our offer will be good for the company, its employees and the
communities we serve because our management group would bring the
continuity and knowhow needed to ensure the continued long-term
success of the business.''
   The management group put RJR Nabisco into ``play'' when it
announced two weeks ago that it was considering a $75-a-share, or
$17 billion, offer to take the company private.
   Kohlberg Kravis, the nation's leading leveraged buyout firm,
quickly followed with a tender offer to shareholders of $90 a share,
worth an estimated $20.3 billion.
   In a joint statement released shortly after Nabisco's bid was
announced, Johnson and Kohlberg Kravis said talks about a possible
joint bid had been terminated, although they left the door open to
``further discussions.''
   The two camps have talked off and on over the past two weeks
without success.
   Speculation that RJR Nabisco's management would unveil a higher
bid today had pushed up Nabisco stock $1.12{ a share before
Johnson's announcement and it rose 37{ cents more to $88 after the
statement was released.
   The Wall Street Journal had reported in today's editions that the
management group was close to topping the Kohlberg Kravis bid.
   The Journal said the group had talked with other food companies
and other investors, including Texas financier Robert Bass, about
joining in the bid.
   In addition, the Journal and the Atlanta Constitution also
reported that another leveraged buyout firm, Forstman Little & Co.,
was considering entering the battle.
   The Journal gave no attribution for Forstmann Little's interest
in bidding for RJR Nabisco, but said it was understood that the
investment concern had signed a confidential agreement with RJR
Nabisco's board allowing it to analyze some confidential financial
information.
   RJR Nabisco's board issued a statement Wednesday inviting other
interested parties to bid for the nation's 19th-largest industrial
concern, maker of such well-known brands as Winston cigarettes and
Oreo cookies.
   Charles Hugel, who is chairman of the committee of outside
directors appointed to review takeover proposals, said the panel
believed ``this will serve the best interest of all shareholders.''
   The financial world had been stunned when RJR Nabisco's
management announced it was considering the leveraged buyout, the
biggest corporate transaction of its kind in U.S. history.
   In a leveraged buyout, most of the purchase price is borrowed
money that is repaid with the acquired company's cash flow or asset
sales.
   The leaders of Kohlberg Kravis reportedly have fought the RJR
Nabisco battle because they are intent on retaining the firm's
preeminence in leveraged buyouts.
   But speculation has arisen that the firm might be under pressure
to withdraw from the bidding. Several institutional investors in the
firm's leveraged buyout fund, which would provide a small part of
the financing, are balking on the grounds that they believe the
firm's approach is hostile, even though it made its offer contingent
on getting support from RJR Nabisco's board.

   The prices of most grain and soybean futures
drifted lower Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade as traders
disappointed by the fitful pace of grain sales for export took
profits off the latest speculative rally.
   The Agriculture Department's confirmation late Wednesday of a
250,000-ton soybean sale to the Soviet Union provided some
consolation but the corn market registered frustration at the lack
of official word about a rumored sale of U.S. corn to the Soviets,
analysts said.
   ``The commercials who were buyers yesterday turned sellers and we
just saw some long liquidation in the market,'' said Cathy Leow, a
grain markets analyst with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New
York.
   The market's weakening tone also reflected expectations that the
USDA will revise upward its 1988 U.S. grain and soybean production
estimates, she said. That USDA crop report is due out next Wednesday.
   At the close, wheat was 1} cents lower to { cent higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.17 a bushel; corn was 4
cents lower to 1\ cents higher with December at $2.82{ a bushel;
oats were 6 cents to 8{ cents lower with December at $2.22 a bushel;
soybeans were 2 cents lower to 3\ cents higher with November at
$7.94 a bushel.

   The stock market was briskly higher this
afternoon, buoyed by the dollar's steadiness after a recent steep
decline.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 21.16 points at
2,177.99 at 3 p.m. EST, after rising gradually through the trading
session.
   Much of the advance was said to come from a surge in Sears
Roebuck, one of the components of the blue-chip indicator.
   Sears shares had soared 2| to 45|, bolstered by unconfirmed
rumors that investor Ronald Perelman is poised to make a bid for the
giant retailer. Sears announced a major restructuring on Monday.
   Advancing issues outpaced declining ones by around 4 to 3 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 817 issues up, 572 down and 553
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 126.08 million shares.
   Stocks have come under some pressure from the dollar's persistent
decline in recent days, which has raised fears that the Federal
Reserve could bolster the U.S. currency by nudging interest rates
higher.
   The dollar stabilized in foreign-exchange trading today, giving a
lift to stock prices.
   ``The tone seems to be better,'' said Jack Baker, the head of
block trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   He noted, however, that activity continues to be dominated by
professional traders, with many institutional investors staying on
the sidelines.
   Through most of this week, trading has been dampened by the
market's anticipation of upcoming events: notably Friday's release
of U.S. unemployment data for October and the presidential election
next Tuesday.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks had
risen 0.60 to 157.60.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was down

<TEXT>
   MGM Grand Inc., financier Kirk
Kerkorian's new casino and luxury airline firm, reported a loss of
$955,000 in its third quarter as a publicly traded company.
   The company said Thursday its sales for the period totaled $54.2
million on its three-plane airline business and two hotel-casinos in
Las Vegas.
   In its first nine months of operations, MGM Grand said its profit
was $356,000, or 2 cents a share.
   In 1987, before the company first sold stock, it lost $4.3
million in the third quarter and $8.3 million in the first three
quarters.
   Controller Kathi Grohgan attributed the latest loss to start-up
costs.
   The company, controlled by Kerkorian and taking its name from the
MGM Grand Hotel and Casino he used to own, consists of the MGM
Desert Inn and MGM Sands hotel-casinos in Las Vegas and the
all-first class MGM Grand Air.
   The hotel-casinos had sales of $48.2 million in the quarter. The
company has agreed to sell the MGM Sands to Interface Group of
Massachusetts for $110 million, but the deal is awaiting approval of
Nevada gambling regulators.
   The airline, which caters to the carriage trade by flying three
luxurious Boeing 727s between Los Angeles and New York, had sales of
$6 million in the third quarter, the company said. Three refurbished
DC-8s are to be added to the line.
   The company refused to release figures on the number of
passengers it carries, and the profit and loss figures are
consolidated results of the casino and airline operations.
   Kerkorian also controls movie maker MGM-UA Communications Co.

   Assets of the nation's 454 money market mutual
funds rose $1.35 billion in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The increase, to $271.96 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a revised $270.61 billion increase in the funds'
assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual
fund trade group.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $280.02 billion in the week
ended Feb. 24.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 223 general purpose funds rose $690.6 million to $86.32
billion, assets of 102 broker-dealer funds increased $553.9 million
to $114.93 billion, and assets of 129 institutional funds rose
$107.7 million to $70.71 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.55 percent from 7.54 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose, to 7.51 percent from 7.50 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 37
days, unchanged from the previous week, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to
6.08 percent as of Wednesday from 6.07 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW
accounts, was unchanged at 5.12 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.83
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 7.82 percent
the previous week. Yields were 8.13 percent on 1-year CDs, up from
8.12 percent; 8.32 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 8.33 percent;

<HEAD>Bacteria Appear To Turn Deadly PCBs Into Less Harmful Material</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oxygen-starved bacteria working in sediment
beneath the Hudson River are transforming toxic PCB compounds into
less dangerous forms, raising hopes of a significant easing of a
major PCB cleanup problem nationwide, researchers said Thursday.
   The resulting types of PCBs do not accumulate in living tissue, a
government scientist said.
   The researchers from Michigan State University said their results
with anaerobic or oxygen-free bacteria could mean that not every
contaminated sediment would have to be cleaned up, and cleanups that
do proceed might be much less risky than people have assumed.
   ``If it is true, it could have enormous significance,'' said
Richard D. Morgenstern, head of the Office of Policy Analysis in the
Environmental Protection Agency.
   Sally Valdez Cogliani, an EPA ecologist and sediment specialist,
said the discovery showed promise, but she was more restrained than
Morgenstern. ``Probably most situations are not anaerobic. I'd
wonder about its general applicability,'' she said.
   PCBs are a common toxic waste problem. In some of the
better-known cases, they have contaminated harbor sediments at New
Bedford, Mass., and Waukegan, Ill.
   Millions of pounds of PCBs were used from 1929 to 1977. The
nation's utilities are faced with the massive task of draining them
from their transformers by the early 1990s, and PCB spills all over
the landscape are a frequent problem.
   The Michigan State findings appear to substantiate a theory put
forward by General Electric Corp., source of most Hudson River PCBs,
in a dispute with New York State over cleanup plans for the river.
   The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation said
it wanted to dredge up and place in a landfill 360,000 cubic yards
of PCB ``hot spots'' in the Hudson River above Albany resulting from
legal GE waste discharges from 1951 to 1973.
   R.W. Groneman, spokesman for the department, said of the new
findings, ``It's a good theory, but what does it mean in the real
world?''
   Until EPA banned manufacture in 1977, some mixtures of the 209
possible PCB compounds, polychlorinated biphenyls, were widely used
as coolants and insulators in electrical equipment such as
transformers and capacitors. The fluids do not transmit electricity
and are extremely difficult to burn.
   Congress required EPA to act because of findings that PCBs
appeared to cause cancer, skin and reproductive disorders in
laboratory animals.
   PCBs accumulate in fatty tissue, and findings of high levels in
fish led New York authorities to ban the taking of striped bass from
the Hudson or ocean waters inshore.
   The Michigan State researchers inoculated a common, heavily
chlorinated commercial PCB with PCB-free bacteria from one of the
Hudson sites. Sixteen weeks later, they found that 53 percent of all
the chlorine had been removed, and molecules with only one or two
chlorine atoms had increased from 9 percent to 88 percent of the
sample.
   The oxygen-free bacteria do not attack single-and double-chlorine
PCBs, the researchers acknowledged. But Frederick Kutz, a biologist
in EPA's Office of Research and Development, said the low-chlorine
PCBs don't accumulate in the bodies of fish.
   Writing in the issue of Science magazine appearing Friday, the
researchers _ John F. Quensen III, James M. Tiedje and Stephen A.
Boyd _ said it appeared that the bacteria had evolved specifically
to attack PCBs. Similar bacteria from non-PCB Hudson sediments had
no effect.
   The PCB changes paralleled GE findings on sediment PCBs reported
last year. GE speculated that bacteria were attacking the PCBs, but
New York State scientists argued that other mechanisms could be at
work, such as greater removal by the river of high-chlorine forms.
   GE contributed financially to the Michigan State research. Boyd
said, ``That doesn't mean they hired us to state something they
wanted said.''
   In proceedings before an administrative law judge, GE argued for
leaving the sediments undisturbed. Judge Daniel E. Louis, rejecting
the proposal, saying it appeared that biodegradation was taking
place but the ``no action alternative would leave PCBs (in place)
and consequently available for the dynamics of river influence at
the whim of nature.''
   ``We feel pretty good'' about the Michigan State confirmation,
said Steve Hamilton, organic chemist at GE's labs in Schenectady,
N.Y.
   ``The exciting thing is to think about some process to speed this
up,'' and to extend it to other PCB sites, Hamilton said. ``We'd
need to understand the process more thoroughly. We know of no limits
at this point.''

   Cashing in on the fax boom, MCI Communications
Corp. on Thursday announced the first network just for the
transmission of facsimile messages.
   MCI, the No. 2 long-distance company behind American Telephone &
Telegraph Co., said the MCI Fax network would allow companies to
monitor their fax use better, get consolidated fax bills, and use
the storing and forwarding capabilities of MCI's computer-controlled
phone network.
   Fax users in the United States will spend $3 billion this year on
transmitting facsimile messages, most of it on long-distance calls,
and the market is expected to grow to more than $9 billion by 1991,
MCI said.
   All fax messages are currently sent over regular phone networks,
including MCI's. MCI said it hoped to grab a large chunk of the
transmission business because its costs will be about the same as
normal phone service.
   No other companies are in a position to match the MCI offering
quickly, said William McGowan, the chairman and chief executive. For
example, AT&T is not set up to bill customers separately for their
fax use.
   McGowan declined to predict how much revenue or market share MCI
would gain with its new service, but he said in an interview, ``It
could have a dramatic impact on MCI. It tells us we were right to
make the investment we have over the last four or five years'' in a
computer-controlled network.
   Using MCI Fax, someone could broadcast a fax message to hundreds
of machines around the country and abroad simply by sending the fax
to MCI along with its list of recipients. As it is now, a machine
that broadcasts a fax message is tied up as it sends it to one
recipient after another.
   MCI's computers will allow someone to send a message by telex,
electronic mail or personal computer and have it converted into a
fax message. Also, MCI can store fax messages and deliver them on
command. Some of these services are already available on advanced
fax machines.
   The service is both national and international, and MCI said it
was accepting orders immediately for service to begin by the end of
November.
   The creation of a facsimile network does not require laying any
new cables. Instead, MCI uses computers to ``carve out'' the network
from its existing computer-controlled network.

   Steadiness in the dollar after a recent prolonged
decline helped boost the stock market Thursday.
   The advance was led by blue-chip issues. The Dow Jones average of
30 industrials ended 13.51 points higher at 2,170.34, after rising
gradually through most of the session. The widely watched indicator
had been up more than 21 points at 3 p.m. EST, but gave ground just
before the close of trading.
   Much of the gain in the Dow average was attributed to a surge in
Sears Roebuck, one of its components.
   Sears shares soared 3 to 46, driven by unconfirmed rumors that
investor Ronald Perelman is poised to make a bid for the giant
retailer. Sears announced a major restructuring on Monday.
   In the broader market, advancing issues outpaced declines by
about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed
stocks, with 781 issues up, 652 down and 545 unchanged.
   Stocks have come under some pressure from the dollar's persistent
decline in recent days, which has raised fears that the Federal
Reserve could bolster the currency by nudging interest rates higher.
   The dollar stabilized in foreign-exchange trading Thursday,
giving a lift to stock prices. The U.S. currency was quoted late in
New York at around 124.68 Japanese yen, up from 124.40 yen late
Wednesday.
   ``The tone seems to be better,'' said Jack Baker, the head of
block trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Bond prices also benefited from the dollar's recovery, which gave
additional support to the stock market, analysts said. Another
positive factor was a decline in prices of gold and other key
commodities, which calmed inflationary fears.
   Market watchers noted, however, that activity continued to be

   Through most of this week, trading has been dampened by the

of U.S. unemployment data for October and the presidential election
next Tuesday.
   ``So far, so good _ but nothing to write home about yet,'' said
Bill Raftery, an analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   Some of the lift Thursday also could have come from stock
purchases by traders not wanting to be caught short when the
unemployment data are published, he suggested.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 152.98 million shares,
down from 161.30 million in Wednesday's session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at
regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled
182.48 million shares.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks edged

<HEAD>Copper Prices Tumble On Profit-Taking</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices fell steeply Thursday on New York's
Commodity Exchange as traders took profits after five straight days
of gains that had pushed the spot price to a record $1.538 a pound.
   Despite the drop, analysts said the bullish trend in copper
likely would continue.
   On other markets, precious metals also declined; livestock and
meat futures were sharply lower; grains and soybeans retreated;
energy futures rose and stock-index futures fell.
   After surging more than 13 percent in just five days, the copper
market turned jittery Thursday and sold off.
   The most active contract, for delivery in December, fell 3.1
cents to $1.432. Spot copper settled at $1.50 a pound, 3.5 cents
below Wednesday's settlement.
   The heights reached during the past week were simply too much for
nervous traders to bear, said George Anagnos, metals analyst with
Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York.
   ``I think the market is generally skeptical of (December) copper
above the $1.45 level and any indication of weakness tends to be
exaggerated,'' he said.
   Nevertheless, analysts said, copper supplies remained extremely
tight, demand for the metal appeared to be increasing and the
2{-week-old copper miners' strike in Peru, the world's
seventh-largest copper producer, was being felt beyond the borders
of that country.
   On Thursday, the Southern Peru Copper Corp. declared a ``partial
force majeure'' on certain shipments to Europe and the United
States, meaning the company would be unable to fulfill all of its
delivery commitments.
   Anagnos predicted December copper futures would trade in a range
from $1.38 to $1.46 before making another upward move. He called the
lower end of that range ``an eminently good buying opportunity.''
   Metals economist Fred Demler of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. said
it was ``prime time to take some profits'' after the recent rally.
But, he added, ``the trend is still up, still bullish. The market
just got a little ahead of itself.''
   Precious metals futures prices also retreated on the Comex on
profit-taking but analysts said the gold and silver markets were
displaying resistance to substantial declines.
   Gold settled 30 cents to 60 cents lower with December at $423.70
a troy ounce; silver was 8 cents to 8.1 cents lower with December at
$6.45 a troy ounce.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum settled 90 cents to
$2.80 lower with January at $577.70 a troy ounce.
   Livestock and meat futures posted steep losses on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange on a combination of weak fundamental and
technical factors, analysts said.
   In the cattle market, ``the cash market softened, the carcass
market was weak, movement of boxed beef was light and at lower
money,'' said Michael Murphy, livestock and meat analyst with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   A heavy sell-off in pork futures was almost entirely due to
profit-taking following recent gains, analysts said.
   Live cattle were .25 cent to .87 cent lower with December at
72.75 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to .58 cent lower
with November at 81.20 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to .75 cent
lower with December at 41 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1
cent to 1.70 cents lower with February at 45.65 cents a pound.
   The prices of most grain and soybean futures drifted lower on the
Chicago Board of Trade as traders disappointed by the fitful pace of
grain sales for export took profits off the latest speculative rally.
   But after the close, the USDA announced sales of 535,000 metric
tons of soymeal to the Soviet Union and another 540,000 metric tons
of soybeans and meal to unknown destinations, which was expected to
give the soybean complex a boost on Friday.
   Wheat settled 1} cents lower to { cent higher with December at
$4.17 a bushel; corn was 4 cents lower to 1{ cents higher with
December at $2.82{ a bushel; oats were 6 cents to 8{ cents lower
with December at $2.22 a bushel; soybeans were 3} cents lower to 2}
cents higher with November at $7.94\ a bushel.
   Oil futures prices headed higher in light, choppy trading on the
New York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 8 cents to 15 cents
higher with December at $13.90 a barrel; heating oil was .35 cent to
.97 cent higher with December at 44.32 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .40 cent to 1.41 cents higher with December at 45.20
cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures retreated modestly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, with the contract for December delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 settling 1.40 points lower at 279.60.

   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply fell in the week ended Oct. 24, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally
adjusted $3,036.6 billion in that week, vs. $3,043.2 billion the
previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, decreased to a seasonally adjusted
$3,868.9 billion from $3,871.0 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $780.8 billion from a revised $783.6 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York banks fell $258 million in the
week ended Oct. 26, compared with a gain of $100 million the
previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window averaged $433 million a day in
the week ended Wednesday, up from $411 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the monetary
base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at
Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation,
was $284.2 billion in the two-week period ended Wednesday, up from
$283.2 billion two weeks earlier.

   The dollar finished firmer in domestic dealings
Thursday, bolstered by a late afternoon rally.
   Gold prices were little changed after rising overseas. Republic
National Bank of New York said gold bullion was bid at $420.85 a
troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, compared with $420.90 an ounce late
Wednesday.
   Trading was relatively quiet as the Japanese markets were closed
for a national holiday.
   The failure of several rounds of interventions by the Bank of
Japan and the Federal Reserve to support the dollar earlier in the
week resulted in selling pressure overseas. But while the dollar
lost ground in European trading, the currency rallied on technical
factors when dealings shifted to the United States.
   The Nov. 8 presidential election remains a primary focus for the
currency market. While the sentiment surrounding the U.S. currency
remains bearish, ``there's a feeling that we'd like to stabilize
(the dollar) at these levels until the election,'' said Earl
Johnson, vice president at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
   Despite the progress Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis has
made to cut into Vice President George Bush's lead, neither
candidate is perceived as having a viable solution to the trade and
budget deficit problems, which rank as primary concerns for currency
traders, Johnson said.
   On a more fundamental basis, some traders believe the flurry of
new bonds the Treasury is preparing to issue will give the dollar a
boost. George DeLuna, a vice president at Irving Trust Co., noted
that foreign purchasers will need dollars in order to buy the bonds.
   In Tokyo, banks and financial markets were closed for a national
holiday. In London, the dollar was trading at 124.25 yen, down from
124.68 yen bid in Tokyo at Wednesday's close. In New York, the
dollar rose to 124.68 yen, up from 124.40 yen on Wednesday.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.7805 to buy one pound, more expensive for buyers than $1.7740
late Wednesday. In New York, however, it cost $1.7775 to buy one
pound, cheaper than Wednesday's $1.7805.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday's
rates included: 1.7778 West German marks, up from 1.7750; 1.4906
Swiss francs, up from 1.4898; 6.0727 French francs, up from 6.0470;
1,322.25 Italian lire, up from 1,319.88, and 1.2212 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.2261.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Wednesday's
rates included: 1.7760 West German marks, down from 1.7840; 1.4863
Swiss francs, down from 1.4975; 6.0565 French francs, down from
6.0885; 1.9990 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0193; 1,317.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,322.00; 1.2234 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2275.
   Gold prices were mostly higher overseas and little changed at
home. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold finished at $421.50 a
troy ounce, down slightly from $421.80 late Wednesday. In London,
gold rose to a late bid price of $422.25 a troy ounce, up from
$417.20 bid late Wednesday.
   In Zurich, the metal rose to $421.85 bid from $417 bid late
Wednesday. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid $422.99, up
from $413.90 bid.
   Silver on the Comex slipped to $6.410 a troy ounce, from $6.488
an ounce late Wednesday. Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid
of $6.51 a troy ounce, up from $6.45 bid late Wednesday.

<HEAD>S&L Regulator Says Deposit Fund Wasn't Intended to Cover
Catastrophies</HEAD>

   The deposit insurance system was never intended
to cover the catastrophic losses now being generated by the nation's
savings and loan institutions, the top federal S&L regulator said
Thursday.
   M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, said
that when Congress set up deposit insurance in the wake of the
Depression it intended to cover only a ``normal'' level of losses.
   However, current losses, aggravated by a severe recession in the
oil-dependent Southwest, are anything but normal, Wall noted in a
speech at the closing session of the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions' annual convention.
   The industry pays for deposit insurance through premium fees. Now
that the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., or FSLIC, faces a
$45 billion to $50 billion problem, Congress has been preparing to
debate a taxpayer bailout.
   Wall said Congress never intended for insurance premiums paid by
S&Ls to cover catastrophic losses. If it had, he said, it would have
followed the advice of a 1935 actuarial study and charged an
insurance premium nearly four times greater than it did.
   Asked if he was implying that Congress should relieve S&Ls of the
burden, Wall said, ``I'm not saying what the solution is at this
point.''
   Meanwhile, the new chairman of the league, B.R. Beeksma, promised
he would vigorously pursue tighter regulation when Congress begins
considering how to restructure the business next year.
   But Beeksma, chairman of InterWest Savings Bank in Oak Harbor,
Wash., also vowed to fight efforts to restructure the business out
of existence.
   ``There are those waiting with knives in their hands to carve up
... our distinct and separate regulatory structure,'' he told 2,300
convention delegates.
   Beeksma complained that healthy S&Ls have taken a ``bum rap'' for
``a relative handful of our institutions'' who invested in exotic
and risky ventures such as windmill farms and racehorses.
   He said it was time for Congress and the executive branch to
``fess up to the fact that they were wrong _ that they made grievous
errors ... when they deregulated our business.''
   Beeksma said healthy S&Ls can't bear the cost of bailing out the
FSLIC without falling into insolvency themselves.
   But, as part of what he called ``our never-again agenda,'' he
said S&Ls would accept a clampdown on the kinds of lax oversight
that contributed to the red ink.
   ``I can promise you that the U.S. League will be vigorous in its
pursuit of tighter regulation and supervision,'' Beeksma said.
   However, Wall said ``there's plenty of blame to go around'' and
``the industry was involved'' along with Congress, the Reagan
administration and state and federal regulators.
   ``The point isn't whose responsibility is it,'' Wall said. ``The
point is this is all history and it's now time for us all to go
forward.''
   Beeksma replaces Theo H. Pitt Jr., a North Carolina thrift
executive who served as league chairman for the past year.
   The trade group also is getting a new president, Frederick L.
Webber, who was an assistant treasury secretary in the Ford
administration and a White House aide under Richard Nixon. He most
recently was president of the National Soft Drink Association.
   Webber replaces William B. O'Connell, who has held the league's
top staff position since 1979.
   O'Connell, in his outgoing address, warned the S&L executives
that ``the very existence of our business ... will be at risk next
year.''
   He said a ``division seems to be developing over the resolution
of the problems'' of the FSLIC and told the delegates they have
succeeded in the past because they have ``stuck together, no matter
what.''
   O'Connell said after the speech he was referring to tension
between healthy and struggling S&Ls. Some healthier S&Ls are trying
to leave the FSLIC and join the commercial bank insurance fund, the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which charges lower premiums.
Struggling institutions who can't qualify for FDIC membership resent
that.

<HEAD>Four Sentenced In Disguised Trader Scheme At CBOT</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Colorado man was sentenced Thursday to six years
in prison on charges he masterminded a scheme to defraud the Chicago
Board of Trade out of $320,000 by using a disguised trader with a
false mustache and forged documents.
   In sentencing Thompson B. Sanders and three other men, U.S.
District Judge Marvin Aspen said the case shows the Board of Trade
is ``ripe .. for corruption and manipulation,'' and that the trading
pits ``can be turned into cesspools.''
   But Scott Early, general counsel for the CBOT, said, ``The judge
has obviously seen a very limited part of the Board of Trade _ one
member.''
   Early said board officials began the probe of the 1986 scheme and
cooperated fully with the U.S. Attorney's office in the prosecution
of the case.
   The judge also fined Sanders $300,000.
   ``You went for the big kill, and you almost got away with it,''
Aspen told Sanders, 45.
   After a three-week trial, Sanders, a former grain trader who
operates a restaurant in Vail, Colo., was convicted in September of
conspiracy, wire fraud and interstate transporation of stolen
property.
   Sanders' lawyer, former U.S. Attorney Dan K. Webb, said he would
appeal.
   The other defendants had pleaded guilty and testified against
Sanders.
   Daniel Dewey, 39, the man who wore disguises to a restricted
trading pit at the CBOT, was given five years in prison and fined
$100,000; David Pelleu, 45, was sentenced to six months of work
release and fined $11,000; and Daniel Kolton, 24, was given five
years probation, 500 hours of community service and fined $2,500.
   Pelleu had helped make phony CBOT badges, while Kolton went on
the trading floor to act as Dewey's associate, Assistant U.S.
Attorney Thomas Durkin said.
   Aspen praised Pelleu for going to the FBI in January 1987 _ when
authorities complained their investigation had hit a dead end _ and
explaining the whole scheme.
   Prosecutors said the disguised Dewey traded U.S. Treasury bond
futures at the CBOT on four days in the summer of 1986. Dewey, of
Ashville, N.C., processed his winnings through Sanders' account at a
brokerage firm, but if Dewey had lost money, the trades wouldn't
have been processed and Dewey couldn't have been traced because of
his false identification, Durkin said.
   But Webb said Sanders set up the plan to shield income from his
wife's divorce lawyer. The defense attorney also maintained that the
scheme never defrauded any other brokers.

   Despite reported intervention by Japan's central
bank, the U.S. dollar strengthened only slightly against the
Japanese yen on Friday morning, although share prices edged higher.
   After opening at 124.72 yen, up 0.04 yen from Wednesday's close,
the dollar traded between 124.69-124.85 yen and was changing hands
at 124.77 yen by late morning.
   Stock and foreign exchange markets in Tokyo were closed Thursday
for Culture Day, a Japanese national holiday.
   Currency market sources said the Bank of Japan entered the market
Friday morning, buying an estimated $30 million to $50 million when
the U.S. currency was trading at around 124.80-124.85 yen.
   But Friday's central bank action, the fourth such intervention
this week, was ineffective in triggering the dollar's rally, with
the dollar trading around pre-intervention levels, the sources said.
   The Bank of Japan does not disclose its currency policies.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost 28.41
points Wednesday, finished the morning session up 4.17 points from
Wednesday's close at 27,989.43.
   Traders said the market was awaiting the October U.S. employment
figures scheduled for release later Friday in Washington.
