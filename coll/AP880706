   An orange juice product-tampering case
widened Wednesday when a suburban supermarket employee found a
juice carton punctured with a syringe needle and bearing a note
warning of poison, the third such incident this week.
   The latest carton was discovered at a Hughes market in Canoga
Park, said police Officer Fred Nixon. The needle and juice were
sent to a lab for testing, but results weren't expected for about
three days, he said.
   ``The M.O. (method) was very similar to the M.O. in the two
previous cases,'' Nixon said. ``We don't know if we have a copycat
or what.''
   As in the two earlier cases in nearby Woodland Hills, a needle
of the type that attaches to a hypodermic syringe was stuck into
the two-quart cardboard carton and a note suggested poison had been
injected, Nixon said. He described the note as a warning, but
refused to reveal its exact wording.
   Tests, as yet incomplete, tentatively cleared one of the first
two cartons of contamination, and no one drank from any of the
cartons.
   The juice brand tampered with Wednesday was Citrus Hill; in the
two previous cases, Monday at a Vons market and Tuesday at an Alpha
Beta market, the brand was Minute Maid. All three cartons were
found outside the refrigerator cases where they are stocked, and
none of the needles in the cartons had syringes attached, Nixon
said.
   On Wednesday, Hughes pulled all chilled orange juice from the
shelves of the store where the tampering took place, awaiting a
fresh shipment, said Harland Polk, vice president for sales. He
said workers had been ordered to watch for tampering after the
first incident.
   Police urged shoppers who had recently bought orange juice from
that store to return it. And they suggested inspecting juice
cartons before buying them at any store in the area, in the western
end of the San Fernando Valley suburbs 25 miles northwest of
downtown Los Angeles.
   Officials at the two stores involved in the earlier cases and at
Minute Maid said they knew of no labor troubles or personal grudges
that might have prompted the tampering, and Nixon said the entry of
a second brand might discount that theory.
   The note on the carton in Alpha Beta referred to ``unsafe
packaging,'' said store spokesman Bill Wade.

   An explosion and fire rocked a North Sea
oil rig with more than 200 workers aboard Wednesday night. Rescuers
said at least one person was killed and 25 people were injured,
many with severe burns.
   Rescuers said early Thursday that one person was confirmed dead
and that more than 200 workers had been evacuated.
   Police said in a statement that some workers were not yet
accounted for, but had no precise figure for the number missing.
   ``The rig is a raging inferno,'' said a statement from the Royal
Air Force Rescue and Coordination Center at the east Scottish town
of Dunfermline.
   The oil extraction rig, code-named Piper Alpha, is owned by
Occidental Petroleum company and is 120 miles off the northeast
Scottish coast.
   ``I think a lot of people have not been accounted for. Some
people ended up in the sea and rescuers are trying to pull people
from the water. It is still dark out there and it is a formidable
task,'' said a police spokesman who declined to be identified, in
accordance with British practice.
   The coast guard service said in a statement: ``The platform has
been abandoned but whether everybody did in fact get off, and where
they went to, is the big question at the moment.''
   Occidental Petroleum's Scottish base at the eastern port city of
Aberdeen said in a statement that 232 workers had been aboard the
oil rig when the explosion occurred at 9:30 p.m. (4:30 p.m. EDT).
   ``Immediate evacuation procedures were implemented. Efforts are
being made to contain the fire on board,'' the Occidental statement
said.
   An international force of six warships _ the NATO alliance's
standing Naval Force Atlantic _ was diverted to the scene, rescuers
said. It includes vessels from Britain, the United States, Canada,
Portugal, the Netherlands and West Germany.
   Another British warship, the Blackwater, was also headed for the
scene, they said.
   The RAF rescue center said 25 injured people, many suffering
from severe burns, were picked up by the semi-submersible rig
Tharos, which was alongside the Piper Alpha rig at the time of the
blast. The rescue center earlier had put the number of injured
aboard the Tharos at 32 but later revised that figure.
   The center originally identified the Tharos as an oil field
support ship.
   Three RAF helicopters and one coast guard helicopter were sent
to the scene while an RAF Nimrod reconnaissance plane flew overhead.
   ``One of the RAF Sea King helicopters is investigating reports
of survivors in the water,'' the RAF rescue center said.
   It said some of those evacuated from the Piper Alpha rig had
been taken to the Claymore Oil field platform, 10 miles west of the
stricken rig.
   An emergency medical team was flown to the scene by helicopter
from the eastern Scottish port city of Aberdeen.
   It was the third incident at North Se oil installations in the
past week.
   Last Friday there was an explosion at British Petroleum's Sullom
Voe onshore terminal on the Shetland Islands.
   On Tuesday night, a fire broke out on the North Sea Brent Alpha
platform.
   Occidental Petroleum is one of the major operators in the North
Sea and recently has been concentrating on new fields.
   Serious incidents have regularly occurred on North Sea drilling,
production and accommodation platforms since the start of the
off-shore exploration boom in the 1960s. Structural defects,
explosions or bad weather have all been to blame.
   The first ``blow out'' was in April 1977 when at least 20,000
tons of oil escaped into the sea from the oil rig Bravo in the
Norwegian Ekofisk field run by Phillips Petroleum.
   The escape was capped but not before an oil slick had spread
over 1,500 square miles.
   The worst North Sea oil field disaster was in 1980, when 137
crewmen on the accommodation platform Alexander I. Keilland died
when it capsized in storms in the Ekofisk area. Most of the dead
were Norwegians.

<HEAD>Scientists Find Evidence for Wind From Galaxy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists today reported new evidence that a
gassy ``wind'' is spurting out two opposite sides of a nearby
galaxy at speeds up to 240 miles a second.
   The wind is apparently driven by repeated supernova star
explosions, said astronomer R. Brent Tully.
   The evidence, an analysis of light from the galaxy, is published
in today's issue of the British journal Nature by Tully and
Jonathan Bland of the Institute for Astronomy in Honolulu, Hawaii.
   A galaxy is a cluster of stars, gas and dust. The study focused
on one called M82, visible with a small telescope, which lies some
60 trillion miles away in the direction of the constellation Ursa
Major.
   Tully said other scientists had suggested the idea of a wind
from M82 because of previous observations. No other galaxy has a
well-documented wind, he said in a recent telephone interview.
   The wind, mostly hydrogen, appears to be going faster and faster
the farther it gets from the galaxy, he said. It apparently began
at least 3 million years ago and maybe tens of millions of years
ago, he said.

<HEAD>Angel Island Eucalyptus Groves Could Face Logging</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angel Island's familiar eucalyptus groves
may be cut down following a yearlong environmental study that says
native trees would make better homes for wildlife on the island in
San Francisco Bay.
   The study by the state Department of Parks and Recreation
concludes that there would be no adverse environmental effects from
logging 86 acres of the 50-year-old trees and replacing them with
native buckeye, live oak and laurel.
   In June 1987, the state announced it planned to cut down the
eucalytpus, an Australian species, as part of a policy to remove
non-native plants from state park preserves.
   But the plan drew immediate protests in the San Francsico Bay
area. ``Essentially, we're pretty unhappy with the report,'' said
Chris Womack of a Marin County group called Preserve Our Eucalyptus
Trees.
   Parks and Recreation Department Director Henry Angonia will make
a final decision on the Angel Island plan after a public hearing
Tuesday night.
   The Army planted the trees about 50 years ago as windbreaks. If
the logging is approved, six groves of eucalyptus covering 24 acres
would be removed this fall. The island, now a park, once served as
an immigration center.
   The environmental study recommends that the other 62 acres be
logged gradually to minimize the short-term effects. The state
would preserve large, older eucalyptus trees near buildings for
their historic significance.

<HEAD>Administration Opposes Constitutional Protections For Cuban
Detainees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration says proposed
legislation to extend constitutional protections to hundreds of
Cuban refugees being held by American immigration authorities would
only delay the process of paroling eligible detainees.
   Two separate bills, drafted after the riots last fall by Cuban
detainees in Atlanta and Oakdale, La., would bar the government
from indefinitely detaining, without a court hearing, aliens who
legally are ``excludable'' under immigration law but who cannot be
deported.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service had found many of the
Cubans who arrived in this country during the Mariel boatlift in
1980 to be unacceptable for admission to the United States, but
Cuban President Fidel Castro refused to take them back.
   Those excludable aliens consisted of mental patients and people
who had committed crimes in Cuba or since their arrival in the
United States.
   The riots broke out at prisons at Atlanta and Oakdale after the
United States tried to reinstate a 1984 agreement calling for the
deportation of 2,746 such Mariel Cubans.
   Deputy Associate Attorney General Cary H. Copeland, testifying
Wednesday before a House panel, criticized one bill as too costly
and said the other could force the government to release dangerous
aliens into American society.
   ``We believe we have a system that can work and will work, and
we hope you will give it an opportunity to work,'' Copeland told
the House Judiciary subcommittee on refugees and immigration law.
   One bill, sponsored by Rep. Robert Kastenmeier, D-Wis., would
grant any Cuban detainee denied parole by both INS and Justice
Department review boards another hearing within 90 days before an
administrative law judge.
   At that hearing, the detainee would be represented by an
attorney paid for by the government and would be able to call
witnesses and present evidence in his behalf and question witnesses
against him.
   The other bill, sponsored by Rep. Pat Swindall, R-Ga., would
limit to six months the amount of time a person could be imprisoned
by the government as an ``excludable alien.'' After six months, the
person would be reclassified as a ``deportable alien'' and thus
would be entitled to constitutional protections similar to those
outlined in Kastenmeier's bill.
   Copeland said the government cannot afford to provide attorneys
to the Cuban detainees and doesn't have enough administrative law
judges to hear their appeals. He said Swindall's bill would
``essentially mandate that Mariel Cubans who were not ready for
parole due to violent propensities be released.''

<HEAD>Crowe's Soviet Counterpart Finds No Similarity With KAL Incident</HEAD>

   The Soviet military chief of staff said at the
beginning of an unprecedented tour of U.S. military bases that he
didn't see any similarity between the downing of an Iranian
airliner last weekend and that of a Korean airliner by Soviet
forces in 1983.
   Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev said he discussed the incident with
his U.S. counterpart and host, Adm. William Crowe, but had
refrained from giving advice.
   ``Yesterday, Adm. Crowe informed me about that, and he told me
about the specifics, and we took some time discussing this,'' said
Akhromeyev, speaking in Russian. ``I and Adm. Crowe are military
professionals and I did not see fit to offer any military advice.''
   ``I would not draw any similarities between the Iranian airliner
a few days ago and the downing of a Korean airliner a few years
ago,'' Akhromeyev told a Pentagon news conference.
   Pressed to explain the differences between the two incidents,
Akhromeyev smiled and said, ``I believe you would be more
interested in the subjects we are discussing today'' as part of the
continuing dialogue between U.S. and Soviet armed forces.
   Crowe and others in the briefing room laughed as Akhromeyev
ducked the question, and the American admiral said a few minutes
later that he was ``looking forward to facing the Soviet press''
when he accepts the Soviet marshal's invitation to visit Moscow at
a later date.
   Crowe, at a grim news conference Sunday announcing that an U.S.
warship had shot down Iran Air flight 655 with 290 people aboard,
said there were ``fundamental differences'' between it and the
downing of Korean Air Lines flight 007 on Sept. 1, 1983.
   The key distinction, said Crowe, was that the Americans fired on
the Iranian jetliner in an area of combat, while the Soviets shot
down KAL 007 in an area free of hostilities.
   ``The fundamental differences, of course, are that it was not a
war zone,'' Crowe said of the KAL incident. ``There was not combat
in progress. There was not combat there normally'' over the Soviet
Kamchatka Penninsula, where KAL 007 was tracked by Soviet fighters
and shot down.
   During their talks Tuesday and Wednesday, said Akhromeyev, he
and Crowe agreed upon military exchanges in 1988 and 1989,
including visits by U.S. and Soviet warships to ports in the
other's country, and exchanges of military historians, senior
officers and delegations.
   Akhromeyev will visit several U.S. military installations during
his tour, becoming the senior Soviet officer to do so, at least
since the two nations were allies during World War II, said Crowe.
   Today, Akhromeyev was to witness naval flight operations and a
firepower demonstration aboard an aircraft carrier, the USS
Theodore Roosevelt, based in Norfolk, Va.; to watch Marine Corps
air-ground operations at Camp Lejeune, N.C.; see live fire
demonstrations at Fort Hood, Texas; and to peer inside a B-1 bomber
and tour missile training facilities at Ellsworth Air Force Base,
S.D.
   Crowe also hoped to give the visiting Soviet marshal a taste of
the United States by taking him to his own alma mater, the
University of Oklahoma, eating barbeque, visiting an Indian
reservation and watching a rodeo.
   Traveling with the Soviet marshal were the chiefs of staff of
the Soviet Ground Forces, A.A. Grinkevich; of the Air Force, Col.
Gen. V.E. Pankin; of the Soviet navy, Adm. K.V. Makarov; and of the
equivalent of the Marine Corps, Maj. Gen. I.S. Skuratov; and the
chief arms control specialist on the General Staff, Col. Gen.
Nikolai F. Chervov.

<HEAD>Former NASA Chief Receives Meese Apology For Wrongful Indictment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   James M. Beggs, who resigned as NASA's
administrator because of federal fraud charges that later were
withdrawn, has received an apology from outgoing Attorney General
Edwin Meese III. It comes a year after another official refused
such a gesture.
   ``Your fellow citizens should now be more aware than ever that
your character is untarnished and your behavior unblemished,''
Meese said in a letter that was hand-delivered to Beggs' home on
June 29.
   When the government withdrew its indictment in June last year,
Beggs told reporters it would be nice if Meese apologized. But
Assistant Atty. Gen. William F. Weld, head of the criminal
division, declined ``the invitation to embrace the language of
apology.''
   Weld, who since has resigned his post, said at the time that he
would trust public opinion to understand that ``in a criminal case
if no conviction is obtained, no blemish should attach.''
   But Meese, who announced his own resignation on Tuesday, wrote
Beggs that he had reviewed ``the circumstances surrounding the
wrongful indictment'' and that he truly regretted the ordeal Beggs
and his family had been put through.
   ``I wish to offer you a profound apology on behalf of the
federal government and the Department of Justice,'' Meese said. He
blamed the aborted prosecution on ``an inaccurate understanding and
assessment of the underlying facts.''
   Beggs, who was executive vice president of General Dynamics
Corp. before he took the top post at NASA, was indicted with the
company and three of its officials in December 1985 on charges they
defrauded the government in a weapons contract. He took a leave
that extended through the Challenger explosion Jan. 28. 1986, that
killed seven astronauts. Beggs then resigned, because the accident
made it imperative that NASA have a hands-on administrator.
   The government conceded in June 1987 it had insufficient
evidence and withdrew its charges against all the defendants.
   Beggs said he was pleased and surprised by the letter. ``I've
had a year now to get over that ordeal,'' he said. ``I guess I
pretty much put it behind me. Right now I've picked up my life, I'm
back working at various things which are interesting to me.''
   He said he had received a telephone call from President Reagan a
few weeks after the charges against him were dropped. ``He told me
how pleased he was that it worked out that way and how sorry he was
it had resulted in my leaving the agency and the (space) program,''
Beggs said.
   Beggs' wife, Mary, said she appreciated the letter because it
was so unusual. ``Nobody knows of the Justice Department ever
having issued such an apology before,'' she said.
   Reporters who have covered the department for the past 15 years
could not recall any similar instance. It wasn't clear whether
Meese also apologized to other defendants in the Beggs case.
   Beggs now is chairman of Spacehab, a private company developing
pressurized 10-foot-long modules to add to the working quarters of
a space shuttle crew.

<HEAD>Enzymes Protect Plants From Heat Stress, Researchers Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A corn plant may curl up and die from heat and
drought, but only after its protective enzymes have put up a good
fight, says the Agriculture Department.
   The department's Agricultural Research Service reported
Wednesday that the two enzymes in corn and other plants help limit
stress from heat and drought. The enzymes seem to work best
``within a temperature range we call a thermal kinetic window.''
   Researchers said that when the plant's temperature rises above
the window, its ability to fight heat stress starts to fade. And
when there is a lack of water for use by the plant's natural
cooling system, the enzymes become less effective and the plant
withers and dies.
   The enzymes identified by agency scientists in Lubbock, Texas,
are glutathione reductase, which stops the buildup of potentially
lethal waste products as a plant fights heat stress, and
hydroxypyruvate reductase, which is thought to protect
photosynthesis, or the plant's food-making process, during stress.
   Jerry L. Hatfield, a research leader at the laboratory, said
thermal kinetic windows vary by plant species and are much narrower
than expected. For example, corn has a window in a range of 77 to
88 degrees Fahrenheit; cucumbers, 93 to 100; wheat, 62 to 73;
spinach, 50 to 63; and cotton 73 to 90.
   Hatfield said USDA plant physiologists John J. Burke and James
R. Mahan were the first to analyze the activity of the enzymes at
different temperatures.
   One of the goals of the research is to transfer one plant's
genes for controlling an enzyme's behavior into other plants,
thereby producing crops that are more tolerant to heat, drought and
other stresses than they otherwise would be, Hatfield said in a
report issued here.
   ``Although such advances may be a long way off, they could lead
to crops better equipped to face such climatic changes as the
gradual heating that may occur from the buildup of carbon dioxide
in the earth's atmosphere,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, a report by the government's Joint Agricultural
Weather Facility said rain and cooler weather in the week of June
27 to July 3 ``eased drought stress in the Great Plains, Delta and
western Corn Belt'' but that ``the lack of moisture worsened in
most Corn Belt states.''
   Overall, the corn crop was in ``still mostly fair-to-poor''
condition, the report said.
   An estimated 96 percent of the nation's soybeans had been
planted by July 3, slightly behind the normal pace. The crop was
reported in ``mostly fair'' condition in the Great Plains and
Southeast but were said to be ``mostly poor'' in the Delta states.
   ``Cooler temperatures eased livestock stress,'' the report said.
``Ranchers continued culling herds as forage supplies decreased.
Producers provided supplemental feed in most areas. Pastures were
mostly poor and showed very little regrowth.''

   The Soviet Union has come back into the U.S.
corn market for the first time in three months to buy 175,000
metric tons for delivery this year under a long-term supply
agreement between the two countries, says the Agriculture
Department.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 175,000 tons of
corn would be about 6.9 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.80 per bushel at the
farm level, meaning that the sale could have a farm value of around
$19 million.
   Prices have shot up recently, reflecting damage to this year's
crop. On March 31, the last time the Soviets bought a significant
amount of U.S. corn, the farm price was about $1.90 per bushel.
   The corn purchase announced Wednesday is part of the grain the
Soviet Union is committed to buy during the fifth and final year of
the agreement, which calls for the annual purchase of at least 9
million tons of U.S. grain. The pact expires Sept. 30, and there
have been negotiations for a new one.
   According to the agreement, the annual purchases are supposed to
include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. The
Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as
wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as two
tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain
equivalent.
   With the latest purchases, the Soviets now have bought 4.36
million tons of corn, plus more than 9 million tons of wheat;
830,700 tons of soybeans; and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal.

   Farmers in designated drought areas who donate
all the hay cut from land in two conservation programs will not
have their federal acreage payments reduced by the Agriculture
Department.
   Previously, farmers who harvested hay from land enrolled in the
Conservation Reserve Program, or CRP, and the Water Bank Program,
or WBP, would have their annual payments reduced by 25 percent the
following year.
   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said Wednesday that to be
eligible for the exemption, a producer must donate the hay through
a designated state agency engaged in drought-relief efforts and
obtain certification from an official of the agency that the hay
has been donated properly.
   More than 1,800 counties have been designated by USDA as drought
areas eligible for the special haying privileges.
   Under the two programs, farmers enroll land for 10 years and
agree not to produce crops on it. They are required to plant
protective grasses or trees to prevent erosion and are paid annual
rental fees by the government for maintaining the acreage.
   Typically, the fees average $40 to $50 per acre annually. Thus,
without the exemption, hay donated to help other farmers would
result in a loss of $10 or more per year in federal payments.

company at the center of the controversy, resigned Wednesday to
take moral responsibility for the uproar, a company official said.
   Hiromasa Ezoe expressed ``sincere apologies for causing this
commotion,'' in which aides to Takeshita, Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa, former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and ex-Foreign
Minister Shintaro Abe reportedly bought shares of the company
before public trading started over the counter and sold them later
at large profits.
   An official at the Finance Ministry said the deals were legal.
Japan has taken steps to toughen its laws against insider trading
after stock prices plunged on worldwide exchanges last October.
   Another official at the Finance Ministry said, however, that the
new laws would not go into effect until next year and would not
apply to the Recruit-Cosmos dealings, which Japanese newspapers
reported took place between 1984-1986.
   Repeated telephone calls to Takeshita's office Thursday went
unanswered, and officials at Nakasone's offices were not available
to comment.
   Miyazawa said he did not know of involvement in Recruit
transactions by any of his aides. Abe told a news conference
Wednesday he was unaware of the deal, but that it was legal. He
promised to question his aides.
   Tokyo Broadcasting System said Wednesday each aide made between
$165,000 and $195,000 on the deals.
   All of Japan's nationwide dailies ran the story on their front
pages Thursday, with the exception of the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the
leading economic newspaper.
   The uproar Wednesday toppled the paper's president, Ko Morita.
He said he was stepping down to take moral responsibility after
earlier admitting to profiting from the transactions.
   The deals came to light after a deputy mayor in Kawasaki was
fired last month for conducting the same type of deal. It
highlights the close connections between Japan's politicians and
businessmen.
   Recruit President Naotaka Ida, at a midnight press conference
Thursday, said the transactions ``do not go against business
ethics,'' and the politicians and media leaders who profited from
the sales ``all understood Recruit.''
   Recruit-Cosmos is a subsidiary of Recruit Ltd., a giant
information services conglomerate that has branched out into
computer leasing, tourism and housing.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Meese Failed to Achieve Much of Conservative
Agenda</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III entered the
Justice Department pressing a conservative legal agenda that
heartened his supporters and drew fire from liberals, but he is
leaving with little of it accomplished.
   The lower federal courts are more conservative than when he
came, but he failed to get two nominees he wanted on the Supreme
Court, and the ones who made it have at times charted an
independent course not to his liking.
   The high court has chipped away at constitutional criminal law
protections that Meese opposed, but they still stand and he has
been rebuffed on a variety of other legal issues.
   ``He failed to articulate any cohesive rationale for what he has
been trying to do,'' Michael Glennon, professor of law at the
University of California, said in a telephone interview.
   Some conservatives argue that the long-running investigations of
Meese have in fact hampered President Reagan's efforts to move
government policy in a law-and-order direction.
   ``The Reagan legal agenda is bigger than Ed Meese,'' said Daniel
Popeo of the conservative Washington Legal Foundation. ``I think
the Reagan legal agenda is detracted from and taken down in having
to defend Ed Meese's problems.''
   Meese, in an interview Wednesday on Cable News Network, said,
``I think we have de-politicized the Justice Department in favor of
strong law enforcement which benefits all of the people.''
   ``If you hadn't had people like myself, and others in the
Department of Justice who feel the same way, we wouldn't have the
fine nominees that have been recommended to the president who
believe, as he does, we should have interpreters of the
Constitution, and not people who will impose their own wills in the
guise of constitutionalism.''
   The outgoing attorney general, who began his public career
advocating tough action against anti-war demonstrators as a deputy
district attorney in Alameda County, Calif., was still talking
tough when he came to the Justice Department in 1985.
   He accused the Supreme Court of weakening the Constitution with
sometimes ``bizarre'' rulings that he said were not ``the supreme
law of the land.'' Among other things, he said the court had erred
in its landmark doctrine that the Bill of Rights protects citizens
against state, as well as federal, government action.
   A.E. ``Dick'' Howard, professor of law at the University of
Virginia, said, ``That created a lot of hue and cry, and a great
deal of fuss. I don't see that any long-term debate has resulted.
Those turned out to be sort of flashes in the pan.''
   More importantly, he said, ``throughout the years that Meese has
been attorney general, the Supreme Court has dealt one rebuff after
another to important administration positions.''
   The most recent example was the court's decision upholding the
independent counsel law, in which Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist, elevated by Reagan with Meese's backing, wrote the
court's 8-1 opinion. Only Justice Antonin Scalia, the most clearly
conservative of the Reagan appointees to the court, dissented.
   ``It seems clear Rehnquist's agenda is somewhat different than
Meese's,'' said Glennon. ``As chief justice, Rehnquist sees it as
his province to fit the interests of an independent and impartial
judiciary.''
   The administration has also lost on cases involving abortion,
affirmative action and church-state relations, among other
questions.
   When moderate Justice Lewis F. Powell retired, Meese backed
Robert H. Bork, a conservative judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals,
for the post. After the Senate rejected the Bork nomination, Meese
recommended a colleague on the appeals court, Douglas Ginsburg, who
withdrew in the face of opposition.
   The eventual choice, Justice Anthony Kennedy, is carving out a
record more conservative than Reagan's first appointee, Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor, but slightly less consistently conservative
than Scalia.
   Some argue that Meese has made headway on issues such as the
rule excluding illegally seized evidence and the Miranda warnings
governing pre-trial police interrogation, which he argued ``only
helps guilty defendants.''
   ``Miranda and the exclusionary rule have been nibbled away at
bit by bit so that today they cover far less than they did eight
years ago,'' said Glennon.
   Howard, however, said, ``My overall sense is that the court had
begun to back off from those police-practice cases in general even
before Reagan became president and Meese became attorney general.''
   In one area, there is agreement about Meese's impact. As
attorney general, he has played a pivotal role in selecting about
200 judicial appointees.
   ``He has captured the lower federal courts,'' said Glennon.
   ``The Meese legacy is much more enduring and I think more
obvious, more evident, in the judicial appointments than in the
Supreme Court decisions so far,'' said Howard.

<HEAD>New Law Requires Motorists To Add `AIDS Gloves' To First Aid Kits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Motorists in West Germany must add two
pairs of surgical gloves to the first aid kits they are required to
carry in their automobiles under a new law designed to prevent the
spread of AIDS.
   Transportation Ministry spokesman Bernd Bialleck said Wednesday
that the regulation takes effect October 1.
   He said it aims to halt the spread of disease, especially AIDS,
in situations where motorists give first aid to bleeding traffic
accident victims.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome destroys the body's ability
to fight disease. It is fatal and a cure has not been found.
   The virus is spread most often through sexual contact, needles
or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood
products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.

<TEXT>
   A team of researchers at the National Cancer
Institute has received the final go-ahead for a large-scale study
of cancer deaths among people living near nuclear facilities,
according to the team's leader.
   Dr. John Boice, chief of radiation epidemiology at the
institute, said Wednesday that the project has now been approved by
an NCI technical evaluation committee.
   ``We've gone through three reviews ... and have gotten all the
approvals,'' he said, adding that the project so far had
encountered ``no major glitches.''
   The U.S. study was prompted by a British survey completed last
year which found that children and young adults up to the age of 20
who lived near any type of nuclear facility had an increased
incidence of leukemia.
   ``We're focusing, of course, on the childhood leukemias because
that's the concern that has been raised from the English study,''
Boice said. ``But we're going to be looking at all malignancies.''
   He said the initial phase of the project began early this year
and is expected to take 18 months to complete.
   Cancer mortality data are being collected for all counties
containing or adjacent to nuclear power plants and other nuclear
facilities, using NCI files that date back to 1950.
   ``We're moving forward, linking the large databases together,''
Boice said. ``All the materials have been collated. The counties
where all the reactors are have been located. ... Control counties
in large part have been selected. We're matching counties based on
mean income, percentage urban and rural, and so forth.''
   Plans for the study, which involves four NCI researchers and two
consultants, also call for a final phase in which the institute
would send teams into neighborhoods to interview people about their
occupations and other factors which can affect cancer rates.
   However, Boice said this would be undertaken only ``if in fact
we found anything of particular interest'' from the initial
statistical survey. ``If we find that there are no elevations (in
cancer incidence), there's little justification to go in and do
in-depth studies,'' he said.

<HEAD>Developer Awaiting Trial In Bank-Loan Fraud Dies in Jail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A real estate developer awaiting trial in what
prosecutors said was one of the biggest bank-loan fraud cases in
U.S. history electrocuted himself by rigging a stripped cord to an
outlet, officials said Tuesday.
   The body of J.R. McConnell, 40, was discovered on the floor of
the Harris County Jail's medical ward about 3:50 a.m. Monday,
sheriff's Lt. G.L. Moore said. McConnell was transferred to the
medical ward after he tried to hang himself in his jail cell March
21 with a cord from an immersion heater.
   Moore said this time McConnell apparently stripped the ends of a
three-stranded electrical cord, placed one end into a wall outlet,
``and then used himself to make a full circuit by attaching the
exposed end to his leg.''
   It was not known how McConnell obtained the cord, but such items
are usually purchased by inmates at the jail's commissary, Moore
said.
   Moore said a note believed to be written by McConnell was found
on a table next to McConnell's bed.
   The note was addressed to his wife, Mary Gantt, said Dick
DeGuerin, his former attorney.
   ``We have a note that we're examining at this time,'' Moore
said. ``It's somewhat illegible and we're attempting to decipher
what it says. But it appears it might possibly be a suicide note.''
   Following his March suicide attempt, McConnell said he was
despondent over delays in his court proceedings.
   His trial was scheduled for July 19 and he had been in jail
since Nov. 17 on a $750,000 bond.
   McConnell surrendered to federal authorities when he got off a
plane from Mexico after having been missing for more than a year.
He and five associates were indicted last October on charges of
plotting to defraud Texas National Bank-Post Oak and Home Savings
Association of $4.2 million to $5.7 million by claiming to own
property in which they had no interest.
   Loans approved by the institutions and backed by property the
defendants did not own were funneled to McConnell through fronts,
prosecutors alleged.
   McConnell, a one-time multimillionaire, said he had 35 cents in
his pocket when he was arrested. He was assigned a federal public
defender because of lack of money.
   His holdings _ which his wife estimated to be between $300
million and $500 million _ are being liquidated under Chapter 11
and Chapter 7 of U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
   McConnell, who made his fortune in Houston, amassed hundreds of
rental properties and development projects here and in Galveston.
   His most ambitious project was a planned 440-acre resort called
Grand Beach on Galveston Island.
   But before the resort's first building could be completed, his
empire began to crumble and McConnell filed for protection from
creditors in October 1986.
   A court-appointed trustee's report said McConnell and the 10
companies included in the bankruptcy filing owed $427 million
against $281 million in assets.
   Two loans listed in the indictment, one at a Houston bank and
another at a savings and loan, were only part of a larger scheme to
defraud lending institutions of at least $162 million, authorities
claimed.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Affirms Lower Court Ruling That Rejects Hauptmann
Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Tuesday rejected
efforts by the wife of Bruno Richard Hauptmann to clear his name in
the 1932 kidnapping-murder of the son of aviator Charles Lindbergh
   In a one-sentence statement, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals here affirmed a September 1987 ruling by U.S. District
Judge Garrett E. Brown Jr. in Trenton.
   Robert R. Bryan, the attorney of Anna Hauptmann, vowed to take
his appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   ``We are undaunted,'' he said in a telephone interview from his
San Francisco office. ``Our goal remains the same: to clear her
husband's name during her life.''
   Mrs. Hauptmann, 89, lives in Yeadon, Pa.
   Her husband was convicted in the March 1, 1932, kidnapping and
murder of the 20-month-old son of Lindbergh and his wife, Anne
Spencer Morrow Lindbergh, from their East Amwell Township, N.J.,
estate.
   Hauptmann was convicted following a sensational trial in
Flemington, N.J. that earned international attention, and was
executed April 3, 1936, at Trenton State Prison.
   Mrs. Hauptmann charged in a federal lawsuit that the case
against her husband should be reopened. The legal action was based
on new evidence Bryan said he uncovered, including more than 22,000
pages of documents and lost trial evidence found three years ago in
the garage of the late Harold G. Hoffman, New Jersey's governor at
the time of the trial and execution.
   The lawsuit claimed that the trial was riddled with
mispresentations and fraud, evidence was suppressed, witnesses were
coerced or lied on the state and testimony was changed.

<HEAD>Maori Warrior's Head To Be Returned To New Zealand For Burial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A preserved and tatooed head of a Maori warrior
that was withdrawn from a London auction after protests will be
returned to New Zealand for burial, the tribal rights group
Survival International says.
   The British woman who wanted to sell the full-size head of the
native New Zealander at a Bonham's auction in May will receive a
hand-carved Maori club in exchange, the auctioneers said Tuesday.
   The head, believed to have been preserved in the early 1800s and
brought to Britain soon after, had been expected to sell for up to
$7,000 at the auction of tribal art.
   It was withdrawn following complaints and threatened court
action from the New Zealand Maori Council and Survival
International.
   Sir Graham Latimer, chairman of the Maori council, said he will
take the head back to New Zealand next week.
   He said Nancy Weller-Poley of East Anglia would be given the
club as a ``token'' in appreciation of her decision to return the
head, which has been in her family for 150 years.
   The head, complete with a full mane of hair, dark brown
concentric circles of tatoos, its original teeth and glass eyes
added by a Victorian taxidermist, is mounted on a platter.
   ``We are absolutely delighted with this dignified and happy
solution for the Maoris,'' said a spokeswoman for Bonham's, which
negotiated the deal.
   Robin Hanbury-Tension, president of Survival International, said
he hoped the agreement would discourage ``this sordid and immoral
trade in human remains _ a trade which is deeply offensive to the
affected tribal communities and which makes a mockery of our own
claims to membership of a civilized society.''
   But the Bonham's spokeswoman, speaking anonymously in keeping
with British custom, said there is a risk owners will now sell such
items under the counter rather than risk public criticism.
   ``They will be pushed underground and nobody will ever find out
that they are on the market,'' she said.
   Survival International said preserving heads was common among
the Maori until the practice was outlawed in the 1820s.
   Mrs. Weller-Poley, asked whether she was satisfied with the
offer of the hand-carved club, said: ``I wouldn't have put the head
up for sale if I hadn't wanted the money. But you have to take
these things as they come, don't you?''

<HEAD>GAO Calls Trade Of Oil Rights For Wilderness Land One-Sided</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressional study says the Reagan
administration's proposal to trade away potentially valuable oil
rights in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is not in the public
interest and should be abandoned.
   The assessment from the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, is being disputed by an Interior
Department official, who says the proposed land exchange offers the
nation a unique chance to acquire valuable fish and wildlife
habitat.
   The GAO study focused on Interior's proposal to trade the
mineral rights to 166,000 acres in the refuge for surface rights to
896,000 acres owned by six Alaska native corporations in seven
other wildlife refuges in the state.
   Last month, Interior Secretary Donald Hodel ordered the trade
put on hold until after Congress confronts the larger question of
whether to allow development of the possibly large oil reserves in
Arctic refuge's 1.5 million acre coastal plain.
   GAO said Interior has valued the 896,000 acres at six times
their appraised market value and that three-fourths of the land has
``only limited wildlife and habitat protection benefits.''
   And while Interior is rating the deal as an even-up trade worth
$539 million to both sides, it is impossible to calculate the value
of the oil rights in the refuge until more exploration is done,
according to GAO.
   ``Interior told GAO that the actual values for the best (Arctic
refuge) tracts could be between zero and 6.5 times the estimated
value,'' GAO said in the study released by Rep. George Miller,
D-Calif.
   ``Under the proposed land exchanges, however, Interior neither
required the native corporations to bid against one another
competitively for the tracts nor retained a continuing monetary
interest in any future oil production,'' GAO said.
   ``GAO believes that the proposed exhanges are not in the best
interests of the government,'' said the study, urging Congress to
reject the plan if Interior refuses to abandon it.
   GAO noted that the $539 million value assigned by Interior to
the 896,000 acres in other reserves is far beyond their appraised
value of $90 million.
   About 279,000 acres were given low acquisition priority or rated
unsuitable for acquisition by Interior, while another 349,000 acres
are already protected from uses inconsistent with refuge programs,
according to GAO.
   ``Finally, about 53,000 acres are most threatened by subsurface
mineral development, but Interior would not acquire the the
subsurface rights under the terms of the exchanges,'' the study
said.
   Susan Recce, deputy assistant Interior secretary for fish and
wildlife and parks, defended the proposed trade as a ``unique,
perhaps one-time opportunity'' to acquire pockets of land owned by
natives in federal refuges.
   Aleuts, Eskimos and Tlingits are among the major groups native
to Alaska.
   In a letter to GAO, Recce pointed out that Interior is forbidden
by law from using condemnation to acquire such inholdings in
Alaska, leaving the ``negotiating climate ... radically altered in
favor'' of the natives.
   She said that although not all the land that would acquired by
the government is high on Interior's acquisition list, the agency
presumes that all privately owned lands within a refuge ``are
suitable for acquisition.''
   Recce said there is legal uncertainty whether the 349,000 acres
are protected from private development. She said that while the
53,000 acres would be open to mineral development, a recent study
suggests this land has a low potential for it.
   Although the Alaska public lands act generally requires land
exchanges in Alaska to be on the basis of equal value, the Interior
secretary can make one of unequal value if ``it is in the public
interest,'' Recce noted.

   An agreement signed by Japan and the United
States will soothe some of the aches and pains that have plagued
the world's biggest agricultural trading partnership, officials say.
   The pact, signed Tuesday, opens Japan to more American beef and
citrus, perhaps doubling the total value of those sales by the
early 1990s.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter called it ``a great
day for American agriculture, a great day for Japanese consumers.''
   Nobuo Matsunaga, Japan's ambassador to the United States, said
the pact marked ``an end to the decade-long trade issue between the
two governments.''
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., also called the agreement ``a big win
for beef producers and Japanese consumers'' but cautioned that the
United States ``must ensure the agreement is carried out'' properly.
   ``This is but the first step in what must be a sustained effort
to increase beef exports,'' Baucus said in a statement. ``Constant
pressure on Japan by Congress, the administration and private
groups finally paid off.''
   The agreement, which was reached last month during negotiations
in Tokyo, will open the door gradually over the next few years to
more U.S. beef and citrus and move away from the restrictive quota
system that has been in effect.
   Earlier demands that Japan allow sales of U.S. rice were dropped
in reaching the settlement on beef and citrus.
   Yeutter said he hoped Japan would relent on allowing rice
imports but that such discussions would be more appropriate in the
current Uruguay round of multilateral trade talks under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT.
   Matsunaga said Japan has made it clear that ``we will not refuse
to discuss the matter of rice'' in GATT negotiations on condition
that other participating countries are prepared to discuss their
own agricultural policies.
   The Commerce Department has estimated that annual U.S. beef
exports to Japan could grow to around $1 billion a year from about
$550 million now. Sales of oranges and juice, now less than $100
million, could rise to more than $150 million, it says.
   Yeutter said in a statement that the signing was a ``historic
development'' for both countries.
   ``It settles one of our most controversial bilateral disputes,''
he said. ``Just as important, it demonstrates that Japan is
accepting even more responsibility as a major trading nation.''
   Yeutter noted that the agreement not only commits Japan to
increase access and eliminate non-tariff barriers to trade in beef,
oranges and orange juice but reduces tariffs on a variety of other
products, including lemons, grapefruit and nuts.
   In a formal exchange of letters dated July 5, Matsunaga said the
government of Japan ``intends to implement market-opening
measures'' as indicated by the agreement and will be prepared to
hold consultations annually with the United States to discuss how
the arrangement is faring.
   Yeutter said in his letter that GATT officials have been
notified of the withdrawal of a U.S. complaint regarding Japanese
import restrictions on beef, fresh oranges and orange juice. The
Florida citrus industry also has withdrawn a petition calling for a
U.S. investigation of Japanese restrictions on fresh oranges and
juice, he said.
   Despite long-standing disputes over U.S. access to the Japanese
agricultural market, Japan continues as the leading single-country
market for American farmers.
   In the fiscal year that began last Oct. 1, for example, total
U.S. agricultural exports are currently forecast at $33.5 billion,
up from less than $27.9 billion in 1986-87.
   Japan's share is estimated at $6.6 billion, or a fifth of this
year's total. That's up from $5.55 billion last year, according to
USDA figures.
   Comparatively, the Soviet Union this year is expected to buy
around $1.7 billion worth of U.S. agricultural products, which is
up sharply from $659 million in 1986-87.

   The downing of an Iranian plane by a U.S. Navy
warship might in an earlier time have put great pressure on
U.S.-Soviet relations, but the reaction of both superpowers has
been unusually restrained, reflecting continued post-summit good
feelings.
   Moscow's criticism of the U.S. action has been circumspect while
the Reagan administration is downplaying previously stated fears of
Soviet expansionism as a rationale for the U.S. military presence
in the gulf.
   The Soviets have used the incident to renew their call for the
withdrawal of the U.S. naval fleet from the gulf but have stopped
short of the type of inflammatory rhetoric that the Reagan
administration used to denounce the Soviet attack on a Korean
passenger plane five years ago.
   The toning down of rhetoric has been evident on the U.S. side as
well.
   Just a year ago, former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger had
said that the United States must not retreat from the gulf because
``we simply cannot allow the Kremlin to have its will over the
region.''
   But now, perhaps with the afterglow of President Reagan's visit
to Moscow still visible, the administration has been citing other
factors to defend its gulf policy.
   The State Department now says the the U.S. goal in the region is
to bring the Iran-Iraq war to an end and to protect the security of
U.S. friends in the area. References to the Soviet Union have been
non-existent.
   All but forgotten is the almost casual way the United States
decided in early 1987 to expand its military presence in the gulf,
when the administration decided to reflag Kuwaiti tankers after a
number of these vessels had been bombed by Iranian planes. The new
policy entitled the reflagged tankers to the protection of the U.S.
Navy.
   The administration took the step as a gesture of concern after
the Soviets began helping out Kuwait by leasing to the Kuwaitis
three Soviet tankers.
   There were some objections at the time, but it was only after an
Iraqi jet, in a case of mistaken identity, attacked the USS Stark
in May 1987 that the wisdom of the administration's course was
widely _ and sharply _ questioned.
   The lives of 37 American sailors were lost, and there was
concern once again that use of the U.S. military to make a symbolic
statement in a Middle East trouble spot was a riskier policy than
it had seemed initially.
   In October 1983, use of U.S. forces in Lebanon in an attempt to
promote peace led to the deaths of 241 Marines after a truck
bombing at a military headquarters in Beirut.
   State Department officials acknowledge that concern about Soviet
domination of the gulf has received less emphasis lately from
administration spokesman.
   The Kremlin, meanwhile, has been showing far more restraint
following Sunday's incident than the United States did in September
1983 when the roles of the two countries were reversed.
   The Reagan administration reacted indignantly when Soviet
fighter planes shot down the Korean passenger plane, causing the
deaths of 269 people. The administration called the incident
``calculated, deliberate murder.''
   In Moscow on Monday, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennadi
Gerasimov soft-pedaled his criticism of the United States even
though, he said, the downing of the Korean airliner was far more
understandable than Sunday's attack on the Iranian plane.
   Whereas the Iranian plane was flying in daylight over
international waters, the Korean plane had intruded into Soviet
airspace at night, Gerasimov said.
   But the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Adm. William J.
Crowe Jr., said Sunday the two incidents were not comparable. He
noted that the Iranian plane was flying over a war zone where there
was combat in progress and that, in contrast to Sunday's incident,
the Korean plane _ unlike the Iranian airliner _ had received no
warning before it was shot down.
   The 1983 incident produced serious strains in Soviet-American
relations, poisoning the atmosphere of a meeting held shortly
thereafter between Secretary of State George P. Shultz and
then-Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko.
   But Gerasimov has been a model of restraint since the Sunday
incident. Alluding to the ``wild anti-Soviet howl'' of 1983, he
said that Moscow has no intention of responding in kind with the
shoe now on the other foot.
   ``I don't think we will follow that bad example,'' he said.

   When Edwin Meese III announced his resignation
as attorney general, Vice President George Bush expressed the
sentiments of a lot of Republican candidates when he said, ``Ed did
the right thing.''
   Meese had become a symbol of what Democrats loved to call the
Reagan administration's ``sleaze factor.'' The effectiveness of
that claim was demonstrated by the growing pressure from
Republicans for the attorney general to leave office before the
fall campaign.
   On Tuesday, Meese finally took that step. He told a news
conference in California that a special counsel's investigation of
his actions ``fully vindicates me'' and that he would leave office
the end of July, only a couple of weeks before the Republican
convention that will nominate Bush for president.
   Independent counsel James McKay found no basis for an indictment
of Meese, but his report _ which could criticize Meese on ethical
grounds _ is still secret. It was filed Tuesday in Washington.
   Asked if he expected to have a role in the Bush presidential
campaign, Meese sounded a little surprised by the suggestion.
   ``In the Bush campaign?'' he said. ``I would think his campaign
is already filled. If I can be of help to Vice President Bush in
his campaign I certainly will.''
   Meese's resignation was as big a contribution as he could
possibly make to the vice president's campaign _ not that his
departure was likely to eliminate ethics as an issue for the
Democrats.
   Michael Dukakis, the Democrat Bush will face in the fall
presidential election, quickly responded to Meese's announcement by
saying, ``Mr. Meese's resignation is long overdue.''
   I don't think he should have been appointed attorney general in
the first place and he should have stepped down long ago,'' Dukakis
added. ``This administration's inability to set high standards for
public service will not be solved by the Meese resignation.''
   But it certainly will give Bush a welcome respite from the
steady hammering of questions about Meese.
   For months, Bush saw polls that said voters favored Dukakis for
the presidency and, at the same time, was asked daily whether he
thought Meese should step down.
   ``You are consistently asked about Meese's problems,'' Bush aide
Peter Teeley said two months ago. ``Meese is a liability.''
   Bush disavowed that statement, but later that month he admitted
that he had met with the attorney general and confirmed that Meese
had promised not to do anything to hurt Bush's presidential
campaign.
   It was already clear that the principal thing Meese could do to
hurt the Bush campaign was to hang onto his post no matter what.
   Bush wasn't the only GOP candidate troubled by the political
fallout from the investigation of the attorney general.
   Four Republican candidates for Senate _ Pete Dawkins in New
Jersey, George Voinovich in Ohio, Slade Gorton of Washington and
Bill Anderson of Tennessee _ had called on Meese to resign and
others had hinted broadly that they thought he was hurting the
party politically.
   Rep. Lynn Martin of Illinois, a national co-chairman of the Bush
presidential campaign, made no effort to hide her pleasure at the
Meese announcement.
   ``I had suggested that he resign a month ago and met with him
about two weeks ago, so I'm not going to suddenly be hypocritical
and say I'm shocked,'' she said.
   ``He (Meese) got what he needed, not leaving town under the
cloud that he was guilty,'' Martin added. ``On the other hand, the
question now of what are you going to do about Ed Meese certainly
isn't going to be asked any more.''

   Here is the text of President Reagan's formal
statement on the resignation of Attorney General Edwin Meese III:
   ``I accept with regret Attorney General Meese's determination to
step down. As the attorney general said in his press conference
today, he can look back with great satisfaction on the contribution
he has made to the department and to the administration of justice
in general.
   ``For more than two decades now, Ed has been a good friend and a
close adviser; his gift for developing and succinctly summarizing
policy options is one of the most unique I have encountered in my
experience in government.
   ``Ed Meese has served the American people loyally and well; he
has led the Department of Justice with courage and vigor and his
work on public policy has resulted in many outstanding
accomplishments. Nancy and I wish him and Ursula all the best in
their return to private life.''

<TEXT>
   With the Democrats making final arrangements
for their convention that will nominate Michael Dukakis for
president, Jesse Jackson is refusing to yield on platform issues or
his claim to be the most qualified Democratic vice presidential
prospect.
   ``The fact of the matter is, I would be an asset,'' Jackson said
on Tuesday. ``I'm convinced that my presence would unleash new hope
in this country, regain more people.''
   ``The others under consideration are unknown quantities beyond
their districts and beyond their home states,'' Jackson said in
Boston.
   Ron Brown, the Washington lawyer who has emerged as Jackson's
top campaign aide, met with Democratic Party chairman Paul G. Kirk
Jr. and Dukakis campaign manager Susan Estrich. The session was at
Dukakis campaign headquarters in Boston.
   Brown described it as ``a good meeting, a good session.'' But
when asked if any agreement had been reached on platform issues on
which Jackson and Dukakis differ, Brown said, ``The decision is
that we have no present intention of dropping any of them.''
   The issues on which they disagree are Jackson's call for a tax
increase, for cuts in defense spending and for endorsement of an
independent Palestinian state.
   Brown said further meetings would be held ``to get the
convention put together.''
   The two campaigns have agreed on much of the convention
schedule, including a plan for Jackson to address the meeting on
the second night, Tuesday, July 19.
   The opening night program will include a speech by former
President Jimmy Carter, as well as the keynote address by Texas
Treasurer Ann Richards.
   The third night of the convention will include the traditional
roll call ballot for the presidential nomination, with Dukakis and
Jackson expected to be the only names put forth. Dukakis has far
more than the delegate majority he needs to prevail.
   The program for the closing night will include nomination of the
vice president and then the acceptance speeches by Dukakis and his
running mate.
   The three commercial television networks are expected to provide
prime time coverage for two hours on each of the four nights.
   In addition to Jackson, officials said it was possible that
former Democratic presidential contenders Sens. Albert Gore Jr. of
Tennessee and Paul Simon of Illinois; Rep. Richard Gephardt of
Missouri and former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt would speak Tuesday
night. Onetime front-runner Gary Hart is not expected to address
the convention; associates say he will write a newspaper column and
provide commentary for Italian television during the gathering.

<HEAD>Victim Compensation Considered, But Obstacles Present</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Reagan says he will consider
offering compensation to relatives of those who perished when a
U.S. missile blew up an Iranian jetliner, but experts say any such
offer would be complicated by legal problems and sensitive
diplomatic issues.
   Several congressional leaders, including House Speaker Jim
Wright, have suggested that families of the 290 victims of Sunday's
attack be offered compensation as a gesture of conciliation and
regret by the United States.
   ``It is a matter that has to be discussed,'' Reagan said
Tuesday. ``I'm waiting for the results of the investigation.''
   A team of Navy investigators arrived in the Gulf region to sift
through information, and is expected to issue a report in two to
three weeks, including the extent of ``potential claims.''
   Legal offices at the State Department, the Pentagon and the
White House have the idea of compensation under active
consideration, according to sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   ``I think it would be a wise idea,'' said Sen. John Warner,
R-Va., the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services
Committee. ``There's a clear admission by our president that this
was an unfortunate accident,'' and Congress likely would provide
the money for such payments, he said.
   Warner said such an offer, perhaps negotiated through a third
party, would demonstrate good faith on the side of the United
States and could help turn a tragic circumstance into something
that could bring peace and stability to the volatile region.
   ``That's something that deserves consideration,'' said Rep.
Henry Hyde, R-Ill. ``Any tragedy, accidental or otherwise, deserves
consideration.''
   Others on Capitol Hill suggested such talk was premature. Rep.
Tom Downey, D-N.Y., said any compensatory payments should be
conditioned on the release of U.S. hostages held in Lebanon by
pro-Iranian groups.
   One congressional source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said administration officials are recommending that Reagan quickly
offer compensation. A principal argument for that course of action
is that it would mute comparisons to the destruction of a Korean
Air Lines jet in 1983 by the Soviet Union, which rejected all
requests for reparations for families of the 269 people aboard.
   Such a decision by the president would be weighted with foreign
policy implications and he would want to consult thoroughly with
Congress before making any compensation offer, administration
officials said.
   ``You've got a basic policy choice, with a very high profile,''
said one administration legal expert, who spoke only on condition
of anonymity.
   But according to administration and congressional officials, a
decision to offer compensation would by no means ensure that it
would ultimately be received by the families of victims.
   Perhaps the most difficult barrier is the lack of diplomatic
relations between the United States and Iran. The only formal
direct contact between the two countries is at a tribunal in The
Hague, the Netherlands, where commercial claims from before the
1979 Islamic revolution are still being negotiated. Any new
compensation issue would be outside the scope of that tribunal.
   Iranians could file a claim in the International Court of
Justice, but the United States has in the past rejected claims of
jurisdiction by the world court. Other communications between the
two countries now are handled by Switzerland.
   In addition, there is no assurance that the Iranian government,
which has used the incident as an anti-American rallying point,
would agree to accept payments. And if money were sent to victims'
relatives through the government, there are no guarantees that it
would be properly distributed, officials said.
   There also is the question of legal authority for making the
payments. Under international law, no nation has to compensate for
damages that result from legitimate military operations. But the
Pentagon does have authority to make payments of up to $100,000 per
person in accidents.
   Most recently, the United States denied liability for damages to
neutral embassies in Tripoli, Libya, in a 1986 bombing raid. And
similar requests were turned down when neutral shipping was struck
during the bombing of Haiphong harbor during the Vietnam war.
   But if the damage resulted from a clear mistake, such as the
missile attack on the USS Stark by an Iraqi warplane last year that
killed 37 sailors, compensation may be paid. Iraq admitted error
almost immediately, and negotiations are continuing on the proper
amount of damages.
   The United States has compensated individuals for damage done by
troops on maneuvers in Central America, and is paying owners of a
fishing boat shot up by mistake in the Persian Gulf.
   In another incident, Israel paid reparations to the United
States following what Israel said was a mistaken attack on the USS
Liberty in 1967 during the Arab-Israeli war.
   In that case, the payment was what lawyers term ``ex gratia'' _
made out of professed sympathy, but without admitting fault or
liability. That could well be the form of any U.S. payment to
Iranian families, one official said.

<HEAD>Meese Magnet for Controversy Since He Came to Washington</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Edwin Meese III, the conservative attorney
general with a law-and-order philosophy, was a magnet for
controversy virtually from the time he set foot in the nation's
capital, but he never lost the confidence of the boss, President
Reagan.
   For nearly 20 years, Meese's life has been entwined with
Reagan's career as the Republican governor of California and then
as president. Since Reagan was elected to the White House in 1981,
Meese has been at the center of power, first serving as counselor
to the president before his confirmation as attorney general in
1985.
   ``He is a good friend,'' Reagan said Tuesday, shortly after
Meese announced he planned to resign in the summer to pursue other
opportunities.
   A native of Oakland, Calif., Meese helped reopen debate on
long-settled issues which are at the heart of the liberal agenda,
from affirmative action and school busing to the rights of the
accused.
   His outspoken embrace of the conservative agenda, his dogged
determination to hang onto his job, his attacks on the Supreme
Court and his personal conduct seemed to attract criticism from all
sides, even from Republicans.
   Through it all, Meese, 56, a stocky lawyer and a police buff,
kept his composure, played down his problems and seemed to enjoy
sparring with his critics.
   ``What is wrong with being affable?'' Meese once asked a
colleague.
   After a grueling, 13-month confirmation hearing to attain the
attorney general's post, Meese said, ``I am not bitter at all.''
Before his nomination, an independent counsel had investigated
Meese's role in obtaining government jobs for financial
benefactors. The report cleared Meese of any wrongdoing.
   At the Justice Department, Meese's tenure was marked by turmoil.
   A major problem began in late in 1986 when U.S. Attorney General
Rudolph Giuliani launched a probe of Wedtech Corp., whose
executives allegedly doled out payoffs to influence public
officials to assist the South Bronx, N.Y., defense contractor.
   By April 1987, longtime Meese friend E. Robert Wallach, who got
$1.3 million from the company, was at the center of the probe. The
next month, independent counsel James McKay began examining Meese's
record of assistance to Wedtech, which occurred at Wallach's behest.
   McKay's report, which has not been made public, was filed
Tuesday in federal court. It apparently absolves Meese of any
criminal misconduct.
   During McKay's investigation, Meese clung to his post despite
protest resignations from two of his top aides and a growing chorus
of calls from a number of conservative congressmen for him to quit.
Meese had the support of the only politician who mattered, Reagan.
   Meese's legal troubles were the final phase in the political
life of a man who has had the highest public profile of any
attorney general since Robert Kennedy.
   As the nation's chief law enforcement officer, Meese opened fire
on the Supreme Court, accusing the justices of weakening the
Constitution with ``ad hoc'' and ``bizarre'' rulings. He said the
decisions were not ``the supreme law of the land.''
   Among other things, Meese said the court had gone astray by
applying the Bill of Rights to the states, which has led to
legalizing abortion and insistence by the court that government and
religion not mix.
   The attorney general also attacked the Miranda warning governing
pre-trial police interrogation procedures, saying ``it only helps
guilty defendants.''
   One of Meese's legacies is the federal judiciary. Since he
became attorney general, Meese has played a pivotal role is
selecting about 200 judicial appointees.
   In California, Meese was executive assistant and chief of staff
to then-Gov. Reagan from 1969 through 1974. He was the governor's
legal affairs secretary for two years before that.
   Before joining Reagan's staff in Sacramento, Meese was a deputy
district attorney in Alameda County, Calif. In that job, he
advocated a tough response to student demonstrators opposing the
Vietnam War.
   Prior to Reagan's election as president, Meese was a professor
at the University of San Diego Law School, specializing in criminal
justice.
   Meese also had his share of personal troubles in Washington. In
1982, his 19-year-old son, Scott, was killed in an automobile
crash. His wife, Ursula, held a series of jobs, most recently
serving as a $40,000-a-year official with the Multiple Sclerosis
Society. The couple has a daughter, Dana, and a son, Michael.

<HEAD>Iranian Jetliner's Altitude, Speed, Course Still in Doubt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pentagon officials still have not resolved
confusion over the altitude, speed or course of the Iranian
jetliner shot down by the USS Vincennes over the Persian Gulf.
   House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., said
after a closed briefing Tuesday that Pentagon officials backed away
from their initial claim that the Iranian plane was outside the
civilian air corridor.
   But a Navy spokesman contacted later said that was still one of
the ``hazy'' areas that has yet to be fully resolved.
   American military officials also have not dispelled doubts about
the altitude and speed at which the Iranian A300 Airbus was
traveling after leaving Bandar Abbas in Iran for Dubai, in the
United Arab Emirates on the opposite side of the Persian Gulf.
   The Pentagon did say Tuesday that the plane was transmitting an
identification signal on a frequency normally used only by military
aircraft, leading the commander of the Vincennes to believe he
faced an attack from an Iranian F-14 fighter.
   Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said a six-member team headed by
Rear Adm. William M. Fogarty landed on the Vincennes on Tuesday to
try to determine why the plane was making those transmissions, how
high and fast it was traveling, and whether it was in the civilian
corridor.
   Iran has asked for an independent investigation by a United
Nations agency, the International Civil Aviation Organization. But
the organization's president, Assad Kotaite said, ``We have not
received ... preliminary reports regarding the circumstances from
the parties involved, except from Iran.''
   Aspin said that Navy officers told him the airliner had strayed
to the western edge of the civilian air corridor, then corrected
course, heading toward the eastern edge, but never left the zone.
   ``It was in the corridor all the time,'' Aspin said.
   The commercial air corridor from Bandar Abbas to Dubai extends
5.5 miles either side of a line between the two cities.
   A Navy spokesman, Lt. Brian Cullin, contacted after Aspin spoke,
said ``the information we have is that it was four miles off track,
to the west. The Vincennes was to the east of the corridor.''
   ``That is one of the hazy points,'' said Cullin, and will be
reviewed by investigators.
   Another point of conflict involves the Vincennes determination
that the airliner was descending from 9,000 to 7,000 feet, and
traveling at 450 knots, a flight pattern that an attacking fighter
might follow.
   Air traffic controllers in Dubai said the Airbus was at 7,800
feet when it was hit by at least one of the two SM-2 Standard
missiles fired by the American cruiser, more or less the same
altitude reported by the Vincennes.
   But another American warship in the area, the USS Sides, which
has less sophisticated radar than the Vincennes, reported that the
Airbus was flying at a steady 12,600 feet, a more common altitude
for commercial jets, and was not descending.
   Pentagon officials initially reported Sunday that the Vincennes
had shot down an F-14. Hours later, Adm. William Crowe, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, acknowledged Iranian claims that an
airliner had gone down.
   Crowe had said the decision to fire was based in part on
classified ``electronic emanations,'' but declined to give details,
saying the information was classified.
   Faced with worldwide shock at the incident, the Pentagon
declassified the information to strengthen its case.
   The Iranian Airbus, said Howard, was broadcasting ``in two
modes. It was squawking on Mode 3'' using a four-digit number
assigned by air traffic controllers to civilian and military air
craft for identification.
   ``It was also sending signals on a military mode, Mode 2,'' said
Howard. ``And the signals that ... the Vincennes was receiving from
that aircraft were signals that we had previously identified or
associated with an F-14. No commercial airliners use Mode-2.''
   The Mode 2 transponder, he said. ``is a special piece of
equipment which has to be put on the aircraft and it can only be
set on the ground.''

<HEAD>Judge Refuses to Shorten Sentence for Brothers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge refused Tuesday to shorten
sentences given two brothers who sold helicopters to North Korea
and vowed to ``never let these guys out'' of jail if there is a
serious incident at the Olympics in Seoul this summer.
   Barry Semler, 38, of Santa Barbara, and Ronald Semler, 44, of
Malibu, pleaded guilty in February to conspiracy to file a false
shipping declaration, exporting a radio handset to Syria without a
license, making a false statement on an export form and failing to
report income earned by a West German company they secretly
established.
   The judge said the men sold hundreds of helicopters to North
Korea through their North Hollywood company, Associated Industries.
   Barry Semler is serving a one-year sentence, while his brother
is serving a three-year sentence.
   Among those writing to Judge Dickran Tevrizian urging him to
allow the men to work off their terms in community service were
actor Kirk Douglas and game show host Monte Hall.
   But Tevrizian refused to cut the sentences, adding, ``If any
kind of incident (happens) at the Olympics, I'll never let these
guys out.''
   South Korea is taking extraordinary precautions to prevent
terrorist incidents they fear might be fomented by communist North
Korea during the Olympics.
   Defense attorney Richard Kirschner has said someone else
arranged the sale of the helicopters through a West German company,
and that the helicopters would have needed millions of dollars
worth of alterations for military use.

   It all happened in an hour _ an hour among
many at a teacher convention filled with the usual quota of debates
on matters ranging from the political to the educational to the
mundane.
   But that hour at Tuesday's session of the National Education
Association's annual convention will go down as one of the weirdest
in the 1.9-million member union's 131-year history _ an hour during
which beach balls flew, and a union chief turned cheerleader.
   The kind of shenanigans, in short, that might well have earned
one of their students a trip to the principal's office.
   Delegates were considering a resolution supporting the cause of
a convicted murderer named Elmer ``Geronimo'' Pratt, a former Black
Panther who has been serving a life sentence at San Quentin prison
in California since 1972. His supporters insist he did not get a
fair trial because of FBI interference. His story has been told by
CBS's ``60 Minutes'' and ABC's ``20-20.''
   His sister, Virginia Pratt, is an NEA member and special
education teacher at Markham Intermediate School, in the Watts
section of Los Angeles.
   After a brief debate, the usual voice votes and standing votes
were judged too close to call. NEA president Mary Hatwood Futrell
declared a roll-call vote of the 8,227 delegates _ exceedingly rare
because it is so time-consuming.
   The Superdome where the teachers are meeting this week erupted
in repeated human waves during the hourlong wait while votes were
tallied. Beach balls appeared out of nowhere, some flying up to the
podium where Futrell playfully hit them back.
   When Futrell announced that U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese
III had decided to resign, the teachers cheered wildly.
   At one point, delegates demanded that Futrell dance or sing to
pass the time. She demurred.
   ``Why don't you do the wave again?'' she suggested. They gladly
obliged, then broke into a loud chorus of ``When the Saints Go
Marching In.''
   Futrell then shared a secret: ``This doesn't appear on my
resume,'' she said, ``but I used to be a cheerleader.'' This
brought loud demands for a demonstration.
   ``I accept the challenge!'' she said, and led the group in an
impromptu chant: ``We want a pay raise! How `bout you?''
   Shortly after 5 p.m., an hour after the resolution came up, the
vote was in: 3,415 against, 3,219 in favor, 293 abstentions.
   Many who voted against it explained they simply lacked the facts
to make a judgment.
   ``The man may be innocent, but we just don't know that,'' said
teacher Karla Steer of Provo, Utah.
   Asked whether Tuesday's convention session would be remembered
as unusually weird, NEA spokesman and 24-year veteran Howard
Carroll said, ``I don't know. They're always pretty weird. But
yeah, it was bizarre, the more I think about it.''

   Fire broke out at a Lake Erie marina in this
northeast Ohio city Tuesday night, destroying about 150
recreational boats and injuring two people, officials said.
   About 100 firefighters from Lorain and five nearby communities
remained late Tuesday at the Copper Kettle Marina, where two
storage buildings collapsed after catching fire before 7:30 p.m.
   ``You could hear little pops when the gas cans of the boats went
up,'' said Loren Barnheiser, who lives across the street from the
marina.
   The fire also produced thick smoke because of the fiberglass
content of the boats.
   Lorain safety inspector Richard Yepko estimated damage at $3
million to $5 million. The cause of the fire was not known.
   The two injured people apparently were in the building working
on their boat when the fire broke out, said Lorain Community
Hospital spokeswoman Thelma Price.
   She said David Dorner, 30, was taken to the hospital and
transferred by helicopter to the Metro General Hospital burn unit
in Cleveland, about 25 miles to the east, with burns over 50
percent of his body.
   Dorner's father Ken Dorner, 51, was admitted to the Lorain
hospital, Ms. Price said. The nature of his injuries was not
immediately available.

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III transferred
many of his assets into mutual funds in 1987, after the breakup of
a controversial financial partnership he had with an investment
manager linked to scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp, his financial
disclosure report shows.
   The new 10-page form, issued Tuesday, shows that Meese funneled
from $50,000 to $100,000 into a Merrill Lynch CMA money fund
account last Aug. 5.
   The report also shows that he invested from $15,000 to $50,000
in each of two mutual funds last October _ Pacific Dunlop Ltd. and
MuniInsured Fund Inc.
   In addition, Meese invested $15,000 to $50,000 in the Merrill
Lynch Pacific Fund last October, selling it for an undisclosed loss
in December.
   Meese opened the various fund accounts after dissolving a
partnership with a corporation operated by W. Franklyn Chinn, who
has been indicted on racketeering charges in the Wedtech scandal.
   Chinn turned a $40,000 profit for Meese on a $50,000 investment
in just 18 months through a series of stock trades. Chinn, using
his contacts in the brokerage industry, obtained hard-to-get
brand-new stock issues and sold them for Meese later the same day,
usually at a substantial profit.
   Meese's financial arrangements with Chinn constituted part of
the investigation of the nearly 14-month-long criminal
investigation of the attorney general by independent counsel James
McKay, sources familiar with the probe have said, speaking on
condition of anonymity. McKay concluded his probe Tuesday by filing
an 830-page report with a federal court, signaling that he is
unable to come up with sufficient evidence to seek an indictment of
the attorney general.
   As White House counselor, Meese in 1981 and 1982 assisted
Wedtech by directing his staff to ensure that the Army gave the
South Bronx, N.Y., defense contractor a fair hearing from the Army
when Wedtech was trying to win a $32 million no-bid contract to
build small engines. The firm ultimately got the work.
   In 1985, Meese formed the limited partnership with Chinn at the
suggestion of Meese's longtime friend, E. Robert Wallach. It was
Wallach who originally urged Meese to become involved with Wedtech
and the San Francisco lawyer eventually was paid over $1 million in
cash and Wedtech stock by the defense contractor. Wallach also is
under a racketeering indictment in the Wedtech scandal.
   In addition to breaking up the partnership with Chinn in 1987,
Meese also sold stock in regional Bell telephone companies last
September. Meese's stock in six of the regional Bells was valued at
from $1,000 to $5,000. Stock in a seventh was valued at less than
$1,000.
   Meese's phone stock provided another focus of McKay's
investigation. The attorney general met with executives of four of
the regional Bell companies who wanted the Justice Department to
reverse its stand and recommend that the regional Bells be allowed
to engage in a number of new types of business. After meeting with
the Bell executives in 1985 and 1986, Meese obtained a White House
waiver which permitted him to participate in the matter, which he
did by approving the sought-for reversal of the Justice
Department's position.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge has declared unconstitutional
a Reagan administration policy of barring aid money for private
organizations that promote abortion as a form of worldwide family
planning.
   U.S. District Judge June L. Green ruled that the policy, first
announced in 1984 at a United Nations conference on population in
Mexico City, violated the free speech and association rights of a
U.S.-based organization that promotes family planning projects in
Third World nations.
   The policy, announced by then-Undersecretary of State James L.
Buckley, has drawn accusations from Third World nations that the
United States is interfering with the family-planning policies of
those countries.
   In an opinion issued Friday but not made public until Monday,
the judge ordered the Agency for International Development to stop
enforcing the policy.
   But Green said AID could bar foreign organizations that receive
U.S. aid from using the money to finance abortion services.
   The ruling was made on a 3-year-old lawsuit by three
family-planning organizations that operate programs in the Third
World, including DKT Memorial Fund Ltd, which is based in New York.
   Green ruled that Parivar Seva Santha of New Delhi, and
Population Services Family Planning Programmes Ltd., of London,
lacked legal standing to press their constitutional claims because
they are foreign organizations.
   But she said the regulations ``impair the associational rights
of DKT'' under the First Amemdment.
   ``AID is in essence coercing the plaintiffs to refrain from
abortion-related programs if they wish to receive AID funding, even
though they are using their own funds for the abortion-related
programs,'' she added.
   AID spokesman Jerry Lipson said the agency had not seen the
opinion. But he said AID will ``certainly recommend that the
Justice Department appeal any aspect of the court's ruling that is
unfavorable to the agency and (that) hey do so on an expedited
basis.''
   ``We believe that the policy and AID's implementing procedures
fully comply with the Constitution and we are confident that the
government will be successful on appeal.''
   Richard Frank, an attorney for the plaintiffs , said the
decision means that ``population activities abroad will not be
hampered as they have been in the past.''
   ``It also will remove substantial irritants in the foreign
relations between the United States and certain other countries''
that object to ``the United States trying to tell their
organizations what their organizations should do with their own
money,'' he said..
   The three groups had planned to seek AID funds to operate a
family-planning program in India but became ineligible to receive
U.S. aid when the policy was announced.
   Under the policy, AID gives money to foreign governments that
support abortion, but the funds are placed in a segregated account
and cannot be used for that purpose.
   The policy requires that non-government groups certify they ``do
not perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family
planning in AID-recipient countries and do not provide financial
support'' to other groups that do.
   Green ordered AID to drop the requirement.
   But AID may require the groups ``to certify that they will not
use AID funds to perform or actively promote abortions.''
   U.S. contributions to foreign groups could be made ``through
segregated accounts, as AID is doing presently in its
government-to-government dealings,'' she said.
   Under the order, U.S.-based groups will no longer be required to
certify that the funds they receive won't be used to support
foreign organizations that promote abortion.

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delegates to the Episcopal Church's 69th General
Convention are moving to pave the way for a woman bishop, yet avoid
a schism with those who object.
   The 200-member House of Bishops on Tuesday voted 135-18 to
approve two resolutions that would soften the impact of the
elevation of a woman.
   The church has no women bishops, even though about 900 women
have been ordained as priests since 1976. Some church leaders say
one could be elected within six months. Conservative members have
said the consecration of a woman bishop could cause a split in the
church.
   Tuesday's vote came while fellow Anglican leaders in the Church
of England in London voted in favor of proposals to admit women to
the priesthood, despite opposition from those who warned of a
schism.
   One resolution approved by the American bishops calls for
respect of the position of those disagreeing with the ordination of
women bishops and the other provides for male clergy to attend the
needs of dissenting parishioners.
   ``I am of two minds. I'm pleased that it represents a larger
number of different groups within the church made a commitment for
women, but it concerns me that such an exception has to be made for
women bishops in the Episcopal Church,'' said the Rev. Annette
Braunlee of Cleveland.
   ``It says that there is something about us that is
threatening,'' she said.
   The proposal now goes to the 900-member House of Deputies.
   AIDS-related issues also were on Tuesday's agenda.
   The House of Deputies unanimously approved an AIDS
anti-discrimination resolution and debated other proposals,
including teaching and paying for AIDS education.
   The anti-discrimination measure ``prohibiting discrimination in
the church on the basis of AIDS, AIDS related complex or HIV
infection,'' was scheduled for debate in the House of Bishops.
   ``We have to give the healing gifts to all,'' said John Fryer, a
psychiatrist from Philadelphia who founded the Philadelphia AIDS
program. ``Jesus healed without moral judgment.''
   The 3,000 delegates to the General Convention meet every three
years to set policy for the 2.6 million-member church. The
convention runs through Monday.

   Composer Toru Takemitsu was in the audience
Tuesday as one of his works was featured at the first of four
concerts of contemporary Japanese chamber music at Japan Society.
   It was ``Rocking Mirror Daybreak,'' commissioned by violinists
Ani and Ida Kavafian for their first duo concert at Carnegie Hall
in 1983 and performed by them again Tuesday.
   The concert, which also featured six other works, is part of the
First New York International Festival of the Arts.
   ``Mankind is facing difficulties,'' Takemitsu commented before
the concert. ``I don't think there is a good way to resolve the
problems. I think it can be done only by friendship, friendship
forever.''
   On Wednesday, before a concert featuring three compositions by
Takemitsu, the composer will give a lecture, ``Contemporary Music
in Japan.''
   Takemitsu has had more than 60 works recorded. Many of his
orchestral and chamber compositions have entered the international
classical repertory. He also has scored more than 75 films,
including ``Woman in the Dunes'' and ``Ran.''
   The chamber group which is performing the four concerts is Sound
Space ARK, founded in Tokyo in 1972 and specializing in modern
music. It is composed of a pianist, percussionist, flutist,
clarinettist and harpist. American guest artists on Tuesday were
the Kavafian sisters and cellist Fred Sherry.
   It was a fascinating concert. Only one piece, ``Recurrence,'' by
Toshi Ichiyanagi, is minimalist. Instead of musical phrases
repeating and varying slightly, musical phrases are repeated
exactly while one of seven instruments solos over the others.
   ``A Winter Day, Homage to Basho'' by Joji Yuasa was modern
impressionism, with musical phrases entering and floating.
``Clarinet Solitude,'' played by Yoshiaki Suzuki, also was
especially noteworthy, in its first shrill, then other-worldly
tones. Joji Yuasa composed it in memory of composer Yoshiro Irino,
who introduced 12-tone music to Japan.
   Yasunori Yamaguchi was surrounded by a vast array of percussion
instruments and used them with an admirably light hand.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon says the Iranian jetliner shot
down in the Persian Gulf was broadcasting identification signals on
two frequencies, one of them reserved exclusively for military
aircraft.
   Every commercial and military aircraft operating in the United
States or overseas is supposed to carry what is known as a
transponder, according to Pentagon and civilian authorities.
   When a radar beam or other radio signal hits the plane, it
activates the transponder to broadcast an identification code under
a system known as ``Identify Friend or Foe,'' designed to prevent
attacks on friendly or civilian aircraft.
   A six-member investigating team, headed by Rear Adm. William M.
Fogarty, arrived in the Persian Gulf on Tuesday and will review
tapes aboard the American warship, the USS Vincennes, to shed light
on the tragedy, officials said.
   Commercial and military aircraft normally broadcast on what the
Pentagon calls Mode 3, sending a reading of their altitude and a
four-digit identification code that is arbitrarily assigned to them
by air traffic controllers.
   Only military aircraft broadcast on Modes 1, 2, and 4, said Lt.
Brian Cullin, a spokesman for the Navy.
   Mode 1 is a two-digit signal which describes the mission and
country of origin of the aircraft, said Cullin. The message is not
encrypted, or put into code that cannot be read by the enemy, and
does not give the type of aircraft involved, he said.
   Mode 2 is not encrypted, either, and identifies the type of
airplane, the country of origin, and the plane's unit, Cullin said.
   Daniel Howard, the Pentagon spokesman, told reporters that the
Iranian aircraft was broadcasting ``in two modes.''
   ``It was squawking on Mode-3 ...,'' he said. ``It was also
sending signals on a military mode, Mode-2. And the signals that
... the Vincennes was receiving from that aircraft, were signals
that we had previously identified or associated with an F-14. No
commercial airliners use Mode-2.''
   The Mode 2 transponder, he said. ``is a special piece of
equipment which has to be put on the aircraft and it can only be
set on the ground.''
   Another type of transponder, designated Mode 4 by the Pentagon,
is classified and encrypted, said Cullin, the Navy spokesman.
Futher details were not available.
   All four modes of the IFF use a Mark-12 transponder which
transmits and receives on the D-band frequency range, which is
1,000 to 2,000 megahertz. The reply signals use different
frequencies and package their information in pulses of differing
lengths, said Cullin.
   It is impossible for normal civilian aircraft to broadcast the
information that would be carried by a Mode 2 transmission,
according to Pentagon and civilian authorities.
   The transponder would have to be altered by the addition of
circuit boards or other equipment in order to transmit in Mode 2,
according to Navy and civilian experts.
   Bill Reed, a spokesman at Allied-Signal Inc.'s Bendix
Communications division in Towson, Md., says airliners are normally
equipped with two transponders, one as a backup. Bendix
manufactures transponders, but it was not known whether it supplied
the ones used by the Iranian A300 Airbus.
   ``Identifying friend or foe is a challenge. It's a process of
elimination. If you've eliminated all the other possibilities you
are left with only one choice: `I can't verify he's a friend so
therefore he's an enemy,''' Reed said.
   Another civilian expert said that Mode 2 and Mode 3 transmitters
``are basically incompatible.''
   ``A military one would send out a signal that would be
incomprehensible to a civilian air traffic controller,'' said the
civilian expert, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``On your
typical U.S. airliner, you would not find a military transponder.''
   A spokesman for the Airbus manufacturer in France said the
airliner was delivered to Iran Air six years ago with two
transponders aboard that should have responded to identification
requests from the cruiser.
   The Airbus spokesman, David Velupillai, did not specify whether
the transponders were calibrated to broadcast at civilian or
military frequency.

   Here is a transcript of Attorney
General Edwin Meese III's news conference Tuesday.
   I have a statement to make, and then I'll be glad to answer any
questions.
   The independent counsel today filed his statutory report after
an investigation that has lasted approximately 14 months and has
gone into many subjects, heard dozens of witnesses, and scrutinized
thousands of documents, including all of my personal financial
records since 1981.
   The filing of the report by the independent counsel, in line
with his previously stated finding, confirms that after an
exhaustive investigation, he has determined that there is no basis
for criminal proceedings with respect to any of the matters that he
has examined.
   I am gratified by this result, but not surprised.
   I knew from the beginning of this investigation that my conduct
has been at all times lawful, and that if the truth were told,
there would be no grounds for any criminal action.
   This past year has been enormously difficult for my family and
me.
   We have been subjected to a barrage of unfair, misleading and
false information circulated through the media.
   I answered any and all questions that the independent counsel
put to me in grand jury sessions and through depositions throughout
the year.
   But I have not yet been able to publicly confront the misleading
and false allegations because of the ongoing independent counsel's
investigation.
   Now that the report has been filed, however, I will begin to
present a full public response.
   My attorneys and I will study the independent counsel's report,
which we have not yet received, but which we hope to receive today
or tomorrow, and we will prepare an appropriate and timely reply,
as the law provides.
   When the court determines what portion, if any, of the report
should be made public, I trust that my written response will
accompany that publication.
   I will then make myself available to answer any and all
questions.
   I look forward to that opportunity, because I am confident that
when the public is able to hear both sides of the story, not just
the prosecutor's view, presented by the independent counsel, it
will be clear to all that I have acted lawfully and properly.
   Now that the independent counsel has finished his task, and one
of the most exhaustive, thorough and costly investigations of any
public official has been completed, the false allegations have been
put to rest, it is therefore an appropriate time for me to announce
certain decisions with respect to my personal future.
   Over the past two months, I have indicated publicly that when I
have achieved several objectives in the Department of Justice and
have set the record straight, and when it is in the interest of my
family and myself that I return to private life, I would leave the
post of attorney general.
   I have stated that I would not resign under a cloud or until I
was completely vindicated.
   I have refused to bend to the constant drumbeat of political and
media pressure, because I have a responsibility to uphold which
involves an important principle, not only for myself and this
administration, but for future government officials who are
subjected to untrue allegations.
   As I have said before, to allow myself to be hounded out of
office by false accusations or allegations, unjust political
attacks, and media clamor, would undermine the integrity of our
system and would abandon the principles of justice which I have
championed throughout my life.

   With the successful conclusion of the investigation and the
burden of false allegations now lifted, I can look ahead to
returning to private life where I intend to continue making a
contribution to society.
   Accordingly, I have informed the president that I will be
leaving the administration towards the end of July or early in
August, in order to accept new opportunities in the private sector.
   Between now and my departure, I will vigorously pursue the
agenda that I have established at the Department of Justice.
   I am proud of that agenda, and of the accomplishments that have
been realized by the department and the administration.
   I deeply believe that President Reagan's administration has
regained the proper course for law enforcement and for the true
administration of justice in the United States.
   I am particularly proud of our successes in the long and
difficult war on drugs, and of the appointment of a large number of
highly qualified judges who will return this country's judicial
system to the path intended by the founding fathers.
   During these past difficult months, my family and I have been
sustained by hundreds of messages of friendship and support from
friends and colleagues, and in many cases, from strangers, who have
extended their encouragement and good wishes.
   I am particularly grateful to the president for his unwavering
support which has been so important to me.
   I also want to thank Vice President Bush for his fairness and
decency in regard to this matter.
   Finally, let me say that it has been an honor and a privilege
for me to work with and for President Reagan.
   Under his leadership this administration has had an outstanding
historical impact on the direction of our country and the welfare
of our people.
   I am proud to have a part in establishing that legacy.
   Now I'd be happy to take any questions anyone might have.
   Yes?
   Q. Mr. Attorney General, is there any truth to the rumor that
either Robert Bork or Elliot Richardson may replace you?
   A. I don't think there's any truth to any rumor about a
replacement because I just talked with the president a few minutes
ago.
   Q. Is there any coincidence in the fact that you will be leaving
your position as attorney general just before the Republican
National Convention?
   A. No _ it's a coincidence purely.
   It just happens that I _ in looking at a variety of things that
I'm considering to do, determined that the end of July or the early
part of August would be the most propitious time for my own
personal plans and the president agreed to that.
   Q. What opportunities are you _
   A. There are a number of things.
   I've had several opportunities presented to me over the past few
months, and I felt it was not appropriate to pursue those or decide
on anything until I had talked with the president and made public
my announcement of leaving.
   Now that that has been accomplished, I will be pursuing some of
these opportunities, making some decisions, and I'll let you know
my specific plans within a short while.

   A man's $3 million trust fund set up for his
hometown as an early Christmas present in 1986 is finally bringing
dollars and cents to this financially troubled southwest Missouri
community.
   Recipients, though grateful, say the first checks from the trust
set up by David Delarue are smaller than they anticipated when the
fund was announced in 1986.
   Payments made July 1 totaled about $150,000, said Donald Place,
who handles the trust at the Hibernia Bank of San Francisco. When
he established the fund with stocks in December 1986, Delarue, a
San Francisco stock analyst and former Bolivar resident, estimated
it would pay about $240,000 each year.
   Elizabeth Simmons, whose handicapped workshop Enterprises
Unlimited received a $1,500 check, said she would use the money to
buy materials.
   ``We sure can use it on our day-to-day expenses,'' Mrs. Simmons
said. ``We really are appreciative of it.''
   Mrs. Simmons had anticipated an initial payment of about $2,400,
to help make a down payment on the building she rents for the
workshop. She employs handicapped adults to do low-skill,
labor-intensive projects such as cutting lumber and stuffing
envelopes.
   Proceeds of the trust are shared by Bolivar; Polk County, of
which Bolivar is the seat, and Polk County schools.
   Bolivar also distributes some of the funds to the local
hospital; police and fire departments; the sports and recreation
department, which was created after the gift was announced, and
Mrs. Simmons' handicapped workshop.
   Delarue made the gift as a gesture of thanks to the community
where he grew up, which has been plagued with financial
difficulties.
   The city's share of the first payment, about $18,000, was less
than half what officials had expected, Bolivar Mayor Joe Lemmon
said. The trustee ``had some bad luck'' due in part to the October
stock market crash.
   ``But we're thankful for every penny of it,'' Lemmon said,
adding that the money will be used for an as yet undetermined
community project.
   Place would not comment on the reason for the reduced amount of
the checks.
   Polk County had budgeted $36,000 from the Delarue trust, but
received about $31,000, said county Presiding Commissioner Howard
Hayter.
   ``We had just put it in the general revenue to take care of our
bills,'' Hayter said. ``A budget's an estimate. Maybe something
else will go over to offset the deficit. If not, we're just going
to be short.''
   The trust will make income payments each July until 2100, when
the principal will be given to the city.
   There were no payments in the first year because administrative
costs swallowed the small amount of income the fund generated.
   Earlier this year, Delarue said Hibernia officials had erred in
the timing of some stock sales. He also criticized what he said was
a practice of selling the original stocks at a loss to buy safe but
low-growth stocks.
   Polk County officials had considered moving the trust from the
San Francisco bank to a Missouri institution, but Lemmon said
Tuesday that they had decided to work with Hibernia.
   Changing trustees ``would be almost impossible ... unless the
officer wants to turn it over,'' Lemmon said. ``That is probably
not even a probability.''

   Q. Do you admit _
   Q. Are you going to offer yourself to the Bush campaign?
   A. In the Bush campaign, I would think that his campaign is
already pretty well filled.
   I _ certainly not in a full-time way.
   If I can be of help to Vice President Bush in his campaign I
certainly will once I'm in private life.
   Q. General Meese, in the report that was filed with the
(inaudible) said to be indications that there were some ethical
questions which could be looked into, but not criminal questions.
(Inaudible) your own stock when you were dealing with the
deregulations of the telephone companies and some of the other
matters. Are you aware of those? And are you concerned about the
internal Justice Department investigation?
   A. Well, nobody has seen the report, so I don't know what and
how anybody could know what's in it.
   Even my own lawyers, when I last talked with them just before
coming down here, had not seen the report.
   So I don't know what's in it.
   But I think the important thing to remember is that the single
duty of the independent counsel was to determine whether any of
these allegations that had been made, the false allegations I
referred to, formed the basis for criminal proceeding.
   The independent counsel found that there was no basis for
criminal proceeding.
   So he has accomplished that task.
   Anything that may be in the report is mere commentary and
opinion.
   If it raises any questions, I'll be glad to answer those.
   Yes.
   Q. Mr. Meese, are the standards to which we can hold public
officials currently legal, then? Or is there a less stringent
ethical standard that we should _
   A. Well, I don't think there's a less stringent ethical standard.
   I think public officials should be held to the highest ethical
standards.
   And I believe, certainly, that in my case I have kept those
standards.
   Yes.
   Q. Didn't you create the appearance of preferential treatment
for help you gave Wallach on the pipeline _
   A. Well, as far as those individual issues, I said that as soon
as the report is made public I'll answer those questions.
   I can only say that certainly there was no indication of
preferential treatment of any sort, and I will go into that more
fully when I can when I am _ when the report and my response are
published and I can comment in full publicly.
   Q. You indicated that the court would make a decision which
portions, if any, of the report would be public. Would you under
any circumstance oppose making that report and your response public?
   A. I don't know because I don't know what's in the report, so I
_ there's no way I can answer any question like that.
   Q. Then how do you know that you've been proven vindicated?
   A. Because if _ if the _ as I say, the only purpose of the
independent counsel, his only duty, is to find out if there's any
basis for criminal proceedings.
   By filing a report as opposed to an indictment, he makes clear
his decision that there's no basis for criminal proceedings.

<TEXT>
   Q. Mr. Meese _
   Q. But that doesn't answer _ I mean, you spoke that you would
leave office only if completely vindicated.
   A. Right.
   Q. How do you know you've been completely vindicated, I mean, if
you don't know if there are ethical questions, I mean?
   A. Because, as I say, the only purpose of the independent
counsel is to determine whether criminal proceedings _ he has no _
his opinion or whatever it might be on ethical issues is not a
matter of his duties.
   So, the fact that these allegations have been proved false and
there's no criminal proceedings fully vindicates me.
   Q. But aren't the proceedings pretty general _ or is that the
only level that you view as being vindicated _ no other ethical _
   A. Well, that's the only _ that's the only _ that's the only
basis on which any allegations had been made that there was some
kind of criminal misconduct.
   Q. If there's any of these ethical questions perhaps that are
turned over to the Office of Professional Responsibility within the
Justice Department, will you cooperate with those steps.
   A. Well, I don't know that there will be.
   But obviously, as I've said before, I will publicly answer any
questions that anybody has about any aspect of my conduct.
   And as I've also said before, I'm sure that a fair-minded
public, when they hear my responses to any questions that might
arise, will agree that everything that I have done has been purely
lawful and proper.
   Q. Have you been waiting for this report to announce your
resignation?
   A. Actually, I've been thinking about my future, and as these
opportunities have come forward, I have determined over the course
of a few weeks here that it would be advantageous for me to return
to private life before the administration ends.
   I have made the final decision on that really over the last week
or weekend actually, and based upon also my conversation with the
president and getting his permission.
   Q. Why is it advantageous? Why not serve out the remainder of
the few months left?
   A. Well, I think when I discuss my plans, it should be made
clear _ it should make itself clear as to why it's advantageous to
leave before the administration ends.
   Q. Mr. Meese, did you know about the $150,000 from Rappaport to
Wallach which went into a pooled investment account for you and
others, and didn't you benefit from that account?
   A. Well, again, I'm going to answer all of these questions when
I'm able to speak fully, but in no way did I benefit from any
$150,000 from Mr. Rappaport nor did it go into any pooled
investment account in which I was a beneficiary.

   Q. Can you comment _ are you seeking a judicial appointment?
   A. I beg your pardon.
   Q. Are you seeking or considering a judicial appointment?
   A. No, I'm not seeking or considering a judicial appointment.
   I had that opportunity many years ago and I've never waivered in
my personal feelings that a judicial career is not something I'd be
interested in.
   Q. Mr. Meese, (inaudible) your investment partnership with
Franklyn Chinn in June 1985 when you learned he was a consultant to
Wedtech?
   A. Well, again, I'm going to be answering these questions fully.
   Let me just say that there was no reason to because I had
nothing to do with Wedtech at that time, or at any time for that
matter.
   Q. Mr. Meese, did you create the appearance of impropriety on
lifting restrictions on the Baby Bell companies when you and your
wife owned stock in them?
   A. No.
   Q. Do you think that some of the recent departures from Justice,
some of those folks should have waited for this report before they
(inaudible)?
   A. Well, we only had two people who departed.
   And I think that's a decision they had to make.
   I must say that the work in the department has gone along
certainly equally well, even if they did depart.
   So, I don't see that's been a big thing one way or the other.
   Q. Mr. Meese, is Bob Wallach still your friend?
   A. Well, again, you know I've been asked that question many
times, and what I have always said is that every time I answer that
question, somebody tries to misinterpret it.
   So I will not answer that question at the present time,
particularly because he has an ongoing legal matter.
   Q. Mr. Meese, there have been allegations of lack of leadership
at Justice Department over the last year or so, and in news reports
over the weekend we heard from people in the Justice Department who
have been charged with prosecuting defense fraud, who say they're
not getting enough direction from the top in sorting out and
prioritizing. Can you respond to that?
   A. Those comments were not from people in the Justice Department.
   I think that was in the GAO study.
   But certainly, if there has been, I think, the top people _ or a
top person in the Criminal Division has left some time ago.
   I think that whatever problems there may have been there have
been corrected by the new assistant attorney general in charge of
the Criminal Division.
   Q. Mr. Meese?
   A. Yes?
   Q. When will you have (inaudible) the report?
   A. I don't knw.
   It'll depend on when my lawyers get it.
   And I would assume after they get it, then I will have an
opportunity to hear from them about it.
   Q. _ your lawyers have it already.
   A. What?
   Q. There were some reports that your lawyers have it already.
   A. Not to my knowledge.
   At least when I talked with them _ the last word I had before I
came down here _ about 20 minutes before I came down here, was that
they expected to receive it today, but hadn't received it at that
time.
   It may be that they have.

   Q. (Inaudible).
   A. At the appropriate time when my response can be filed with
it, certainly.
   Q. Oh, I see.
   A. Well, obviously, we wouldn't want to have half the story,
would you?
   Q. If the (inaudible) panel was not to include your response as
an appendix, would you still agree to have the report published?
   A. Well, that's hypothetical, because I think under the law,
they have to put forward the whole thing.
   There's no legal basis to keep our response private if the
report is made public.
   Q. Attorney General Meese, is there anything else premature
about your announcement being vindicated when you haven't seen the
report, your attorneys haven't seen the report.
   A. Well, the report _
   Q. What's different today than yesterday? You knew the report
was going to be filed, did you not?
   A. Well, the fact that the report is filed.
   You see, up until the filing of the report, at any time, the
independent counsel could have concluded the opposite _ that an
indictment would be filed.
   And it is the fact _ the only duty, as I mentioned earlier, the
only function of the independent counsel is to decide whether
criminal proceedings are warranted.
   By filing a report, instead of an indictment, he has made the
definitive judgment that there are no criminal proceedings and
therefore vindication naturally follows.
   Q. Sir, who would you like to see replace (inaudible).
   A. That's an issue for the president to decide.
   We have plenty of time obviously, since I won't be leaving for
several weeks, we have plenty of time to work on that and I'm sure
that I'll have _ as a matter of fact, I will be talking with the
president about that in the near future.
   Q. (Inaudible).
   A. Well, I certainly would give him the benefit of my thoughts
on the subject, but the appointment should be, as it was in my
case, entirely up to him.
   Q. When did you inform the president of your decision?
   A. I talked with him earlier today.
   Q. What time?
   A. Gosh, I don't know.
   Probably around 1 o'clock our time here or thereabouts.
   Q. Mr. Meese, based on your experience, what would you suggest
to your predecessor to avoid the controversy _
   A. My predecessor?
   Q. I'm sorry, your successor, to avoid the controversy swirling
around your your leadership in Justice?
   A. Well, I think the controversy _ it would be: Don't have
political opponents and don't do anything. Nobody will get mad at
you then.
   Q. What was the president's reaction to your suggestion that
you're _
   A. Well, I don't usually characterize my conversations with the
president but let me say that the president wanted to be sure that
I felt that this was something that was in my best interests and on
the basis that I felt that it was, then he said that he would agree.

   Q. Have you given any consideration to the concern about the
so-called sleaze factor and the impact that will have on Mr. Bush's
campaign in the fall (inaudible)?
   A. I don't think that's going to have any impact whatsoever.
   Certainly, there's no basis for any sleaze factor accurately
being portrayed to this administration.
   There have been occasional instances of individuals, but by and
large, I would say that our administration will stand up with any
as far as honesty and integrity, particularly when we have had to
battle so many false allegations by political opponents because we
were doing things different from traditional administrations in
Washington.
   So I don't think that's a factor that should be a bother at all
if people are honest about it.
   And I must say that if you have to look at those kinds of
factors, I think that the other party is certainly as vulnerable,
many more times over than our party ever would be.
   Q. Isn't it entirely possible, though, that you will be leaving
office in late July or early August, not under a criminal
misconduct cloud (inaudible) but perhaps under an ethics cloud?
   A. No, I don't think so.
   As I say, I'll answer any questions anybody has, and I think
I'll be very satisfied with the public view based on all my answers.
   Q. Is there a specific date on which your resignation is
effective?
   A. No, I've just indicated generally when I'm leaving, because
obviously part of it will pertain to the decisions I made as to the
next course of action.
   Q. Will you be returning to California?
   A. Again, there are a lot of decisions to be made, and I haven't
finalized any at this point.
   Yes?
   Q Why are you here? Can you chat about your purpose for being in
California?
   A. Oh, yeah. I'm here _ I was, earlier today, as some of the
people here know, I went up with the campaign against marijuana
planting.
   I have been _ for some time they had asked me to come out and
see that project, so I attended a briefing this morning at the
California Division of Law Enforcement in which that whole plan was
outlined and many of the members of the executive committee of the
program were there.
   And then we went up into the hills, saw an actual plot that had
been raided, and which will be eradicated and destroyed.
   It was mainly to find out about this program in more detail.
   I've been briefed on it each year, but this is the first chance
I've had to get to California.
   I've been to other places before to watch the program there,
talk with the people involved, but this is the first time I've had
a chance to be here in California and observe the program firsthand
here.
   And I'm very pleased with the result.
   It's been an excellent program and a very important one, both
from a domestic and an international standpoint, in terms of our
anti-narcotic program.
   Q. Attorney General, you couldn't be much farther away from
Washington to announce your resignation. Was that planned?
   A. No _
   Q. Was there any specific reason for being this far away from
the capital?

   A. No, it was just _ this has been a long-scheduled visit.
   I was here not only for the marijuana campaign, but also
yesterday I spoke here in Sacramento to the International
Association for Identification, a group of law enforcement,
scientific and forensic specialists.
   That's been planned for several months.
   And so it was just happenstance that I happened to be here on
the day that the report indicating there'd be no criminal
proceedings was filed.
   Q. Has anyone from the Bush campaign ever suggested that you
step down?
   A. No.
   Q. Will you be writing a book about your Washington experience?
   A. (Laughs.) I don't know.
   We'll see what happens.
   Again, there are a lot of things I've got to think about, and so
we will consider a lot of possibilities.
   So I couldn't tell you whether I will or not.
   Q. As A.G. you supported a plan in Central America to use a
defoilant, I believe called Spike against cocaine growers. There's
been some controversy about that because of its highly toxic
nature, not just with cocaine, but with other plants. Would you
support the continuation of that plan?
   A. I certainly would, because it's not highly toxic.
   As a matter of fact, it's a herbicide that is used in the
western United States every day by farmers and by agricultural
experts.
   So I think there's no real danger from it.
   And obviously we have already taken soil tests to be sure that
it would not be environmentally harmful in the areas of South
America, actually, where it was proposed to be used.
   So I support it.
   I also support extensive environmental testing, to be sure it's
safe.
   But assuming that it is, based on the previous tests, I think it
would be an excellent means of helping those countries eradicate,
in this case, the coca plants, and do what their presidents have
told me they want to do, and that is, get their countries out of
being source locations for these narcotics that are coming to the
United States and to Europe.
   Q. (Inaudible) manufacturer has balked at that. Apparently one
of the reasons is they didn't want the drug lords down there to get
after (inaudible). How did you respond to their balking?
   A. Well, their so-called balking is something that's being
discussed with them now.
   It had nothing to do with environmental damage.
   I think it was fear, perhaps, for their employees or operations.
   If that was the case, then those are problems we just have to
work out.
   But I don't think tht anybody, any firm that is manufacturing a
safe product that can be used in the war against drugs, has the
right or the _ certainly not the _ should not have the moral
opportunity to withdraw from the fight against narcotics.
   I think it'd be a terrible thing if people who could help end
the tremendous suffering from narcotics would not let their
products be used.
   I think that would be a moral black mark against any such
company that did that.

attorneys and improved the capabilities of all of our field forces.
   I think the law enforcement cooperation between federal agencies
and state and local agencies has attained the highest level in the
history of the country.

of the effort against drugs and the cooperation between federal
agencies, as well as their cooperation with state and local
agencies in the drug matter, has never been this high, again, in
the history of the country.
   So all of these are areas.
   There are many more.
   We can go into almost every _ I set something like 25 different
objectives when I started in the attorney general's office, in each
one of those we've made considerable progress or actually
completely achieved the objective.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Friends and foes of Edwin Meese III agree with
the attorney general's decision to quit, but differ over whether he
served President Reagan with distinction or dishonor.
   The administration's most controversial active Cabinet member
announced Tuesday he will leave in late July or early August, and
proclaimed that an 830-page independent counsel's report on his
conduct ``completely vindicates me.''
   Sources said Independent Counsel James McKay decided not to seek
criminal charges against Meese for his ties with the
scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. or any other activity.
   But critics warned the attorney general's backers not to be too
exuberant, because the report's conclusions about his ethical
conduct could still be ``devastating.''
   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., one of Meese's critics on the
Judiciary Committee, said ``the damage has already been done'' to
the Justice Department by Meese's conduct.
   ``I didn't think anything could get him to leave. Certainly
everybody's been telling him he's doing enormous damage to the
department,'' he said.
   But Sen. Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, a Republican supporter of Meese
on the Judiciary panel, indicated Meese decided to quit after
learning the report would recommend against filing criminal charges.
   ``All he wanted to do was hang in there just to vindicate
himself and then resign,'' Hatch said.
   ``I don't know of anybody else who's been kicked around as much
as Ed Meese and his family have been in this town. He's gone
through unholy hell for the last number of years,'' said Hatch.
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., whose Governmental Affairs
subcommittee issued a critical report on Meese's ethics, was one of
those urging the attorney general to be cautious until a federal
court releases the still-secret report.
   He said an ``ethical cloud'' will hang over Meese until the
report is made public.
   Generally, the resignation announcement gave longtime Meese
critics a new excuse to attack him, and his backers another chance
to defend the nation's chief law enforcement officer.
   ``Any student in an introductory course in American politics
knows that simply staying out of prison cannot be the standard for
remaining as the attorney general,'' said Rep. John Conyers, Jr.,
D-Mich.
   Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, a Judiciary Committee member,
called Meese ``an embarrassment to the United States. His
resignation is long overdue and should have come months ago.''
   The ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Strom
Thurmond of South Carolina, commended Meese for serving the country
``in a highly capable manner.''
   While Meese's actions rarely bring neutral comments, Rep. Harris
Fawell, R-Ill., appeared to come close, saying: ``The fellow has
been charged with a lot of hearsay allegations, none of which the
special counsel has been able to establish. But on the other hand,
the perception is not good.''
   There were differences over the effect Meese's decision will
have on the fall presidential campaign.
   ``I would guess that no one welcomes his resignation more than
George Bush and the Republican candidates right now,'' said Sen.
Paul Simon, D-Ill., who ran unsuccessfully for his party's
presidential nomination.
   Hatch predicted Meese's critics will try to keep Meese ``in
front of the public eye ... and blow this thing out of proportion
even with the vindication.''
   The vice president, who will be nominated as the GOP
presidential candidate in August, would only say, ``Ed did the
right thing and I wish him well.''
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill, said the resignation ``takes him out of
the equation now as a figure of controversy'' in the upcoming
elections.
   Michael Dukakis, the certain Democratic presidential candidate,
called Meese's resignation ``long overdue.''
   ``I don't think he should have been appointed attorney general
in the first place and he should have stepped down long ago,'' he
said. ``But this administration's inability to set high standards
for public service will not be solved by the Meese resignation. We
need a president who believes in public service who will set those
high standards and make our government something Americans can be
proud of once again.''
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said Meese ``made a wise decision in
using the vindication of the independent counsel's investigation to
put this controversy behind him ...'' The way is now cleared, he
said, for the appointment of an attorney general who can do his job
``without the burden of this controversy upon his shoulders.''
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., chairwoman of a civil service
subcommittee that has criticized the ethical standards of the
Reagan administration, said, ``Hopefully, this will help them put
some people in to bring a little dignity and vigor back.''

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III on Tuesday
became the latest Reagan administration official to announce his
resignation. Here is how the Cabinet and top adminstration posts
have changed since President Reagan took office in 1981:
   SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: Frank C. Carlucci was sworn in Nov. 23,
1987, replacing Caspar W. Weinberger, who had held the post since
January 1981.
   NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: Colin Powell succeeded Carlucci as
national security adviser. Carlucci had been named to the post by
Reagan on Dec. 2, 1986, replacing John M. Poindexter, who resigned
in the wake of the Iran-Contra affair. Poindexter had taken over
from Robert C. McFarlane in December 1985. McFarlane had succeeded
William P. Clark in November 1983. Clark had replaced Richard V.
Allen in 1982.
   SECRETARY OF STATE: George P. Shultz replaced Alexander M. Haig
Jr. in 1982 after Haig resigned.
   SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY: James A. Baker III became treasury
secretary in 1985, replacing Donald Regan who became White House
chief of staff; the two traded jobs.
   JUSTICE DEPARTMENT: Meese, who served as White House counselor
during Reagan's first term, said he would leave office at the end
of July or beginning of August. No successor has been named. Meese
replaced William French Smith at the Justice Department Feb. 25,
1985.
   SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR: Donald P. Hodel took office in
February 1985, replacing William P. Clark, who resigned. Clark had

office Oct. 19, succeeding Malcolm Baldrige, who died July 25 from
injuries suffered when a horse he was riding fell on him.
   SECRETARY OF LABOR: Ann Dore McLaughlin was sworn into office on
Dec. 17, 1987, replacing William E. Brock, who left to join Bob
Dole's unsuccessful campaign for the Republican presidential
nomination. Brock had held the office since April 1985, replacing
Raymond J. Donovan.
   SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES: Otis R. Bowen was sworn
into office in December 1985, taking over from Margaret M. Heckler,
who became ambassador to Ireland. Mrs. Heckler had replaced Richard
S. Schweiker, who resigned in January 1983.
   SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION: James H. Burnley IV was sworn into
office Dec. 3, 1987, replacing Elizabeth Hanford Dole, who resigned
to join her husband's presidential campaign. Mrs. Dole had replaced

February 1985, replacing T. H. Bell, who had resigned in December
1984. Bennett announced last month that he would leave the Cabinet
in mid-September.

   The U.S. Navy's downing of Iran Air Flight
655 will likely fuel debate on a proposed U.N. naval peacekeeping
force the Soviets are pushing as a way to diminish Washington's
presence in the Persian Gulf.
   The attack Sunday on the airliner with 290 people aboard will
also complicate U.N. efforts to mediate between Iran and Iraq and
bring about a cease-fire in their 7{-year-old conflict.
   Last September, in his annual report, U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar called for new, innovative forms of
peacekeeping, perhaps including a U.N. naval force to protect
civilian shipping and maintain maritime peace.
   But Washington, which has deployed the Navy in the gulf to
assert its strategic interests and protect neutral commercial
shipping, has said it is not leaving the oil-rich strategic
waterway.
   Still, the U.S. naval presence in the gulf is increasingly
controversial and Sunday's jetliner downing _ during the latest in
a series of U.S.-Iranian clashes _ demonstrates the volatility of
the region and the problems U.S. forces face in trying to keep the
peace.
   The Soviet Union, its allies, Iran and other nations argue that
far from keeping the peace, the U.S. presence inflames tensions.
   In commenting on the disaster, the official Soviet press agency,
Tass, said: ``The tragedy has borne out once again that the United
States naval fleet must leave the Persian Gulf without delay.''
   The Pentagon said the U.S. warship that shot down the Iran Air
Airbus mistook it for an Iranian F-14 jet fighter.
   Iran has requested a Security Council meeting that is expected
early next week and would likely see the Soviets press their call
for withdrawal of all U.S. military forces from the gulf and
introducing an international naval force under U.N. command.
   The council's five permanent members are the United States, the
Soviet Union, Britain, China and France.
   The two superpowers have not participated in other U.N.
peacekeeping operations because they were perceived as putting
their national strategic interests first. The Soviet Union now
wants to change that.
   Since last September, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze has been saying that the time has come for a U.N.
naval peacekeeping force.
   Under the principles of U.N. peacekeeping, such a force can only
operate with the consent of the parties concerned.
   It must be impartial and not favor either side and it must not
use force, except as a last resort and only in self-defense.
   But the United Nations and its peacekeeping forces are facing a
financial crisis and the prospects of funding a new naval force are
bleak and compounded by U.S. resistance.
   The attack Sunday will also hurt efforts to end the Iran-Iraq
war.
   U.N. officials and diplomats say the attack on the Airbus has
generated sympathy for Iran and hardened Iran's determination not
to stop fighting until Iraq is branded the aggressor.
   That demand has been a major roadblock in getting Iran to accept
a cease-fire in the bloody conflict.

<HEAD>Highlights Of Meese's Legal Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a rundown of the legal problems that
have faced Attorney General Edwin Meese III in recent years.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>July 26, 1983</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   White House counsel Fred F. Fielding begins reviewing
allegations that Meese, then White House counselor, and Michael
Deaver, who at the time was White House deputy chief of staff,
received $118,000 in loans arranged by John R. McKean, a tax
accountant who later was appointed to the Postal Service board of
governors.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Sept. 27, 1983</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   An Army inspector general finds that Meese's promotion to
colonel in the Army Reserve violated certain procedures, but said
no evidence was found of use of ``undue influence.'' The
investigative report recommended against revoking Meese's
promotion. Meese's promotion was approved by Maj. Gen. William R.
Berkman, whose reappointment as chief of the Army Reserve was
confirmed by the Senate on Feb. 24, 1983. On that same day, the
Senate approved the promotion of Meese to colonel.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>March 27, 1984</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General William French Smith asks for the appointment
of a special prosecutor to investigate allegations against Meese,
who had recently been nominated to be French's successor. The
investigation was prompted by reports that Meese failed to list on
his financial disclosure form an interest-free $15,000 loan his
wife received from Edwin Thomas. Thomas, his wife and son were
appointed to federal jobs. The investigation also would look into
other transactions, including the loan from McKean.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>April 5, 1984</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Senate investigators begin looking into Meese's failure to
report reimbursements he received for more than 30 trips he took as
White House counselor. One day later, former President Ford
suggests that Meese should resign, although Ford says he does not
believe Meese has broken any laws.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Sept. 20, 1984</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Special prosecutor Jacob A. Stein concludes that he has found no
basis for prosecuting Meese for ethical mistakes, and a three-judge
panel accepts the counsel's report. Stein had investigated 11
allegations concerning Meese, including charges that Meese played a
role in awarding government jobs to Thomas and his family in
exchange for a $15,000 interest-free loan.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Jan. 28, 1985</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Two Office of Government Ethics staff members conclude that
Meese, then attorney general-designate, violated federal
conflict-of-interest rules, but the agency director overrules them.
The preliminary finding was changed after Meese's lawyers submitted
a rebuttal. The staff report found violations involving two
individuals who helped Meese financially and received high
government jobs.
   After considerable debate, the Senate votes to confirm Meese and
he is sworn in as attorney general on Feb. 25, 1985.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Nov. 25, 1986</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Meese announces that the United States secretly sold weapons to
Iran and profits of between $10 million and $30 million were
diverted to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. National security adviser
John M. Poindexter resigns and NSC aide Lt. Col. Oliver L. North is
fired.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Dec. 18, 1986</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility
investigates Meese's decision to delay an FBI probe of an airline
involved in Iranian arms deals and weapons shipments to the
Nicaraguan rebels. The Justice Department says Poindexter asked
Meese in October to delay the inquiry of Southern Air Transport,
formerly owned by the CIA. The FBI assists in investigating the
10-day delay.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Jan. 7, 1987</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department requests an independent counsel to
investigate allegations that former White House aide Lyn Nofziger
may have violated federal ethics laws by lobbying for the Wedtech
Corp., a defense contractor, shortly after leaving public office in
1983. The decision requesting a counsel is made by a deputy to
Meese, who removed himself from considering the request because he
knows Nofziger.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>April 6, 1987</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Meese acknowledges that he intervened on behalf of Wedtech to
ensure that it got a fair hearing from the Army in its effort to
win the engine contract. Meese also says his friend and former
lawyer, E. Robert Wallach, sent him a series of memorandums in 1981
and 1982 discussing Wedtech.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>May 1, 1987</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The chairmen of the Senate and House judiciary committees ask
James McKay, the independent counsel, whether he can expand his
criminal investigation to include Meese's involvement with Wedtech.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>May 11, 1987</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Meese asks the special prosecutor investigating Nofziger's ties
to Wedtech to include him in the investigation. Meese also
announces that he has terminated his financial partnership with W.
Franklyn Chinn. In February, Chinn was forced to resign from the
Wedtech board because of allegedly questionable financial
transactions.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>June 28, 1987</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Sources familiar with the grand jury investigation into the
Iran-Contra affair tell The Associated Press that White House aides
who complained that Lt. Col. Oliver North may have been violating
the law were told Meese had approved North's actions.
   The sources also said Meese and North held meetings on a regular
basis before the Iran-Contra affair unraveled. The Justice
Department says Meese gave no legal clearance for North's
activities.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>June 30, 1987</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Office of Government Ethics says Meese violated financial
disclosure requirements after investing $60,000 with Chinn. The
agency's director said Meese voluntarily invested the money in 1985
under an arrangement that fails to qualify as a blind trust under
the 1978 Ethics in Government Act.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Aug. 4, 1987</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The General Accounting Office charges that Meese failed to
properly disclose the assets held, purchased and sold by a business
partnership formed by Meese and his wife. Meese responded that any
mistakes were inadvertent.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Oct. 15, 1987</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Investigators looking into Meese's activities as White House
counselor widened their probe to include his actions in connection
with a friend's efforts to secure government backing for a pipeline
project, sources report.

   The government promised to make Wednesday's
general elections free of violence and fraud, and opposition
parties mobilized thousands of poll-watchers nationwide to hold the
government to its word.
   The final tally wasn't expected before the end of the week, but
the outcome is virtually certain _ the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party hasn't lost a presidential election since its
founding in 1929.
   Voters will choose a new president and members of congress at
55,000 polling places across the country, under guard by thousands
of troops.
   Polling stations open at 8 a.m. (10 a.m. EDT) and counting is to
begin when they close 10 hours later. Many parties plan to begin
releasing unofficial results on election night.
   Civilians were barred from carrying arms and most workers were
to have the day off. Bars also were ordered closed for election day.
   President Miguel de la Madrid, in a nationally televised speech
Monday night, pledged to guarantee ``clean, legal and peaceful''
elections, saying ``it is a commitment of the Government of the
Republic to comply strictly with the law.''
   Carlos Salinas de Gortari is the candidate of the PRI, as the
governing party is known by its Spanish initials. His winning the
election is already presumed, and the only suspense lies in his
margin of victory and the aftermath.
   Salinas de Gortari, a 40-year-old Harvard-trained economist, was
expected to break PRI tradition and win with less than the nearly
70 percent accorded de la Madrid.
   Opposition parties on the left and on the right of PRI have
turned this campaign into a vigorous race and put the governing
party's legitimacy on the line by making allegations of fraud the
dominant issue and attempting an ambitious monitoring effort.
Several opposition parties said they would send thousands to
polling stations across Mexico to ensure honest elections.
   Some, like 54-year-old businessman Manuel J. Clouthier of the
rightist National Action Party, or PAN, vowed to lead campaigns of
civil disobedience if the elections were crooked.
   A double slaying Saturday cast a pall over a campaign that for
the most part has been a war of words.
   Four bullets to the head killed one of candidate Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas' top strategists, Francisco Ovando Hernandez, on his way
home from a political meeting. Cardenas is a maverick reformer who
quit the PRI to run as the candidate of a predominantly leftist
coalition.
   Ovando's aide, Ramon Gil Heraldez, also was shot and killed and
documents on the National Democratic Front's election monitoring
vanished from their car.
   Cardenas, 54, spent Tuesday mourning Ovando, a longtime friend
and political ally who served as his attorney general when Cardenas
was governor of the central state of Michoacan.
   Jorge Obrador Capellini, Mexico City judicial police director,
said Tuesday that an investigation determined that the killing was
in revenge for Ovando's battles against organized crime while
Michoacan attorney general.
   He said he ruled out a political motive for the murder. Police
are investigating about 15 suspects but none have been arrested, he
said.
   A Gallup poll of 2,960 Mexican voters last month showed Cardenas
running a strong second to Salinas de Gortari. According to the
poll, the responses indicated that Salinas de Gortari would get
about 56 percent of the vote, Cardenas 23 percent and Clouthier 19
percent.
   The remaining 2 percent were undecided or favored the two other
candidates: Rosario Ibarra de Piedra, a human rights activist
running on the ticket of the small, radical Revolutionary Workers
Party, and Gumersindo Magana Negrete, the conservative Roman
Catholic activist who is the candidate of the Mexican Democratic
Party. The margin of error was 3 percent.
   The poll was conducted in late May and early June and was
commissioned by ECO, Inc., a Los Angeles-based company affiliated
with Televisa, a private Mexican television station with ties to
the government.
   Clouthier and his free-market economics are popular in northern
Mexico. Cardenas' base of support is in his home state and in
sprawling Mexico City, home to a quarter of the nation's 80 million
people.
   The PRI's strength lies in organized labor, among the
traditional folk of the countryside and in the many labor, business
and social organizations it controls. It also is the only party
with organizations nationwide.
   On Tuesday, the liberal newspaper La Jornada published a poll
showing Salinas de Gortari could receive 50 percent of the vote,
Cardenas 27.6 percent and Clouthier 18.3 percent. It had a 5
percent margin of error.
   More than 38 million people are registered to vote in Mexico,
where a one-term president takes office every six years on Dec. 1.
   The 64 senators, two from each of the 31 states and the federal
district, also serve single, six-year terms. Deputies serve
three-year terms.
   In a nation where one party has dominated politics for
generations, voter apathy is common. For weeks, the government and
party leaders had been urging people to vote and to do so
peacefully.
   Even the Roman Catholic Church broke its long silence on
politics, exhorting the faithful to do their civic duty and the
government to hold clean elections.

office. Meese announced he will resign in late July or early
August, saying the conclusion of the investigation without an
indictment makes it clear ``there is no basis for criminal
proceedings.''

<HEAD>Meese Legal Troubles At A Glance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here, at a glance, is a look at Attorney
General Edwin Meese III's legal troubles, which began last May 11
when independent counsel James C. McKay launched a criminal
investigation of his activities. McKay, who filed his report
Tuesday to a three-member federal appeals court panel, found
insufficient evidence to recommend criminal prosecution of Meese at
this time.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Here is a summary of the various matters that have been
investigated:
   _The involvement of Meese when he was White House counselor with
Wedtech Corp., a New York City defense contractor on whose behalf
Meese intervened in 1981 at the behest of his longtime friend, E.
Robert Wallach.
   _The attorney general's actions, again at Wallach's request, in
connection with a $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline project. Wallach, a
San Francisco lawyer, was representing one of the project's
partners.
   _Meese's $14,000 in telephone industry stock holdings at a time
when he met with executives of the regional Bell companies, who
were seeking a reversal of Justice Department policy opposing
expansion into new areas of business by the regional firms. Wallach
wrote a memo to Meese urging him to become personally involved in
the matter, and within weeks the attorney general approved a
reversal of the department's position.
   _The role of Wallach in helping obtain a job for Meese's wife,
Ursula, whose $40,000-a-year salary came from a contribution from a
Washington real estate family leasing space to the Justice
Department.
   _The Office of Professional Responsibility, a Justice Department
unit which examines improper behavior inside the department, is
expected to study ethical questions raised by McKay's office in its
report.
   _In a matter unrelated to McKay's inquiry, the Office of
Government Ethics is launching an investigation into why Meese
solicited 30,000 lawyers and businessmen to pay more than $3,000
apiece to a profit-making organization to attend a conference in
Japan.

   Diving crews searched for a full day
but were unable to locate the body of a 5-year-old boy presumed
killed in a July Fourth boating accident that left three others
dead, police said.
   The 20-foot boat, which authorities said was overloaded, was
carrying 15 people as it returned from a fireworks display. The
boy's mother and sister were among the victims.
   Coast Guard Petty Officer Scott Whalen said the search was
suspended because of darkness Tuesday and that local authorities
would resume the search today without Coast Guard assistance.
   The bodies of the other three victims were immediately recovered
but the 5-year-old, Kenneth Carvalho, was not found, according to
New Bedford Police Officer Ray Furtado.
   The boat was headed to the dock when ``two boats passed them,
one on each side, at a high rate of speed, causing large waves,''
Furtado said. The wakes caused the overloaded boat to flip over in
the New Bedford Harbor.
   ``It was definitely overloaded, definitely over capacity,''
Coast Guard Petty Officer David Foley said.
   Other boaters rescued the 11 survivors, Petty Officer 1st Class
Brandy Ian said.
   When the Coast Guard arrived, they found the bodies of Jean
Fauteaux, 49, and Maria Carvalho, 27, the missing boy's mother.
Coast Guard divers pulled the body of Mrs. Carvalho's 15-month-old
daughter, Melissa, from under the overturned boat. The victims were
all of North Dartmouth.
   The missing boy's sister, Amy Lynn Carvalho, 8, was released
Tuesday from St. Luke's Hospital in New Bedford. Alan Vieira Jr.,
1, of New Bedford was in good condition today, hospital spokeswoman
Jennifer Pollard said.

<HEAD>PTL Security Chief Says He Didn't Bar Bakkers from Heritage USA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT MILL, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jim Bakker and PTL officials disputed the
reception the former television evangelist received when he
appeared at the ministry's Heritage USA theme park over the holiday
weekend.
   Bakker said Tuesday that PTL Chief of Security Gene Ervin asked
him and his wife, Tammy, to stay away from Fourth of July
ceremonies at Heritage USA Monday night after earlier weekend
appearances caused a commotion.
   Bakker said Ervin told him that PTL trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton
``was worried because of the amount of people that would gather
around us, that it would be dangerous.''
   But Ervin said, ``I only advised them that if they came on the
property, we didn't want any type of disturbance. That was it.
There was no talk about prohibiting them from the property.''
   Bakker, who is seeking to buy back Heritage USA, said he and his
wife drew 2,400 supporters in afternoon visits Sunday and Monday.
On Sunday night, he said he and Tammy went out for ice cream and
were surrounded by supporters at a shopping mall connected to the
Heritage Grand Hotel.
   ``It was so overwhelming,'' Bakker said. ``They started saying,
`We want you back.' They followed us to our car. We decided to go
home.''
   But Ervin said th crowd of between 150 and 200 people included
many who do not support their return.
   ``There was some hecklers and jeers coming from the crowd. Some
elderly people were shoved, bumped, (and) pushed around,'' he said.
``It caused what I considered a safety hazard.''
   Ervin also said Bakker told him his supporters could riot upon
his command, a claim the evangelist denied.

<HEAD>Families of Iran Air Victims Have Shaky Legal Claim, Lawyers Say</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Airliner-Compensation, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MITCHELL LANDSBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If the United States offers reparations to the
families of people killed in the attack on an Iranian jetliner, the
amount is likely to be far less than U.S. courts typically award in
liability cases, lawyers say.
   And if the U.S. does not voluntarily offer reparations, the
relatives of the 290 victims will have difficulty staking a claim
for compensation in the courts, according to experts in
international law.
   ``If the facts are as the Navy has said ... I would be surprised
if the Iranians would have a claim,'' said Don Wallace Jr., a
professor of international law at Georgetown University in
Washington and director of the International Law Institute.
   ``There is no remedy ... that I can think of offhand,'' agreed
Steven C. Nelson, a Minneapolis lawyer who is chairman-elect of the
American Bar Association's section on International Law and
Practice.
   Some members of Congress have called on the United States to
offer voluntary reparations to the relatives without conceding any
wrongdoing. Lawyers familiar with such ``ex gratia'' payments
predict that the payout would be modest by U.S. standards.
   ``If we said, `OK, we'll pay $20,000 per person' and did it
quickly, that's probably the sensible way to do it,'' said Andrew
Lowenfeld, a professor of international law at New York University.
   That is the amount specified by an international treaty, the
Hague Protocol, to which Iran is a signatory.
   Another lawyer, Lee S. Kreindler, who specializes in aviation
cases, estimated that such payments might run as high as $150,000
per passenger. But, he said, ``I would not expect offers to be made
in the magnitude of offers that are made in domestic U.S. air
accidents.''
   As far as suing for compensation, most lawyers say the
survivors' standing to demand compensation is tenuous at best.
   The problem for the survivors is that the U.S. government is
protected by sovereign immunity from claims by foreigners. Although
there are exceptions to that _ such as claims under the federal
Tort Claims Act _ they would appear to be ruled out in the Iranian
case because the accident occurred during combat.
   ``It's not simple negligence,'' said Lowenfeld. The Tort Claims
Act, he said, would apply in a case in which ``you're crossing
Fifth Avenue and a postal truck runs a red light and hits you.''
   Another possibility is that the Iranians could file a claim with
the International Court of Justice, as Nicaragua did after the
United States mined its harbors. In that case, however, the U.S.
simply rejected the jurisdiction of the world court, and presumably
it would do so again.
   ``This is the ultimate problem under international law _ there's
no sheriff,'' Nelson said.
   Kreindler said he believes the Iranians may have a case _ either
against the United States or against the airline. His clients have
included relatives of the passengers of the Korean Air Lines plane
that was shot down by the Soviet Union in 1983. Their case against
the Soviets was rejected; their case against KAL is pending before
the U.S. Supreme Court.
   ``I'll take the case,'' Kreindler said of the Iranian crash. ``I
think there's going to be a recovery if somebody makes a claim.''

<HEAD>Strikes in Armenia, Azerbaijan; Petition in Estonia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Armenians have gone on strike in two
southern republics, closing a major airport in Armenia and bringing
to a halt industry in a disputed area of adjacent Azerbaijan,
according to the official press.
   The report indicated the protesters were angered at how their
leaders had represented their demands to the national Communist
Party conference in Moscow.
   Earlier Tuesday, dissidents in the northern Baltic republic of
Estonia said they had gathered more than 6,000 signatures calling
for freedom for three imprisoned Estonian nationalists.
   The Soviet government daily Izvestia said the strike in Armenia
began Monday, a day after thousands of people met in the Theater
Square of Yerevan, the capital of the southern republic.
   The Armenians called for a strike after hearing the comments of
Armenia's representatives to the party conference that ended
Friday. The leaders had urged caution and restraint.
   Most Armenians want a region of Azerbaijan called
Nagorno-Karabakh annexed to Armenia. The mountain enclave's
predominantly Armenian population has been agitating since February
to be united with neighboring Armenia.
   Armenia supports the demand. Azerbaijan opposes it.
   In February, at least 32 people were killed in riots over
annexation which broke out in Sumgait, Azerbaijan.
   Most Armenians are Christian, most Azeris Moslem.
   In its report Tuesday, Izvestia said most flights in and out of
Yerevan were canceled and the airport was filled with stranded
travelers.
   ``Like yesterday,'' the report said, ``a series of the city's
industrial concerns aren't working, or are working with less than a
full work force.''
   The newspaper said that in Stepanakert, the largest city in
Nagorno-Karabakh, many industries and institutions were shut down.
   On Sunday, Izvestia said, thousands of people gathered on the
Yerevan city square to watch a television broadcast by delegates to
the four-day party conference in Moscow.
   During the conference, Armenian party leader Suren Arutyunyan
said authorities could not normalize the situation in Armenia,
where large demonstrations frequently have occurred in support of
the annexation demand.
   He proposed that the conference take up unspecified amendments
to the Soviet constitution.
   Delegates who spoke Sunday supported Arutyunyan's call for
restraint and went directly to the square to talk to the crowd.
Izvestia said that after a ``stormy debate,'' a committee was
formed and called for a general strike.
   The committee demanded that the Soviet Supreme Court take over
the trials of those charged in the Sumgait violence _ most of the
victims were Armenians _ and full disclosure about the alleged
poisoning of workers at a factory in the town of Masis.
   Izvestia provided no more information about the Masis incident,
except to say an investigation was under way.
   Solving ethnic disputes and increasing the economic autonomy of
the country's republics are two of the key issues in Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's program to restructure the Soviet state and economy.
   The dispute between Azerbaijan and Aremenia has given an
immediacy to these issues. Indeed, the party conference called for
greater attention to republics' calls for economic autonomy, but it
said authorities would not tolerate efforts to whip up ethnic
tensions.
   In addition to Azerbaijan and Armenia, delegates from the Baltic
states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia also brought up ethnic
questions at the conference.
   On Tuesday, about a dozen protesters demanding freedom for three
Estonian political prisoners said they had gathered more than 6,000
signatures during a five-day demonstration in Tallinn, Estonia.
   One of the protesters, Eve Parnaste, said the three prisoners
had been demanding publication of a secret 1939 non-aggression pact
between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union that placed the Baltic
republics of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia under Moscow's control.
   ``We will continue the demonstration until they are freed or
until the authorities give us an exact date for their release,''
she said during the protest outside the Estonian Supreme Court
building.
   All three were arrested this year, charged with spreading
anti-Soviet propaganda or slandering the Soviet state.

   Whether the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party is capable of gracefully accepting defeat could
be decided in this large and rebellious northern state.
   Nationally, party candidate Carlos Salinas de Gotari is expected
to win the presidency. But it is generally agreed that it will be
by the lowest margin ever, perhaps as low as 54 percent.
   In Chihuahua, a traditional stronghold of the conservative
National Action Party and also a state where the governing party
has been known to rig elections, the Institutional Revolutionary
Party has, for the first time, admitted it could lose four of six
congressional districts.
   National Action Party leaders said this week that the state
government has agreed to changes in the electoral procedure that
give them some hopes for a clean election.
   ``But I will tell you Thursday morning whether this was a fair
election,'' said Guillermo Prieto, a National Action Party
candidate favored to win a congressional seat.
   The opposition party has one congressional district in Chihuahua.
   In 1983, shortly after President Miguel de la Madrid took office
and promised respect for opposition electoral triumphs, state
elections in Chihuahua gave the National Action party seven
municipalities.
   It was a short-lived experiment. In 1986, in elections widely
believed to have been rigged, the governing party won back all of
the municipalities.
   If the Institutional Revolutionary Party loses the four
congressional districts in the two largest cities, Chihuahua and
Ciudad Juarez, at least one of the Senate seats could be in danger
too.
   National Action Party officials said the state government had
agreed to several of the opposition group's demands to improve the
electoral process, including the use of a better indelible ink than
that recommended by the national government.
   The electoral commission also agreed to move 300 voting booths
into schools instead of private homes, where they originally had
been scheduled.
   ``The state government is trying to improve its image,'' Prieto
said. ``It does not want any conflicts.''
   There are 1.3 million registered voters in the state. About 60
per cent of them are expected to vote.

<TEXT>
   The National Health Service, Britain's cherished
cradle-to-gave health care system, has officially hit middle age.
And at 40 years old, the $41-billion-a-year giant is showing signs
of a midlife crisis.
   Parties and political shouting matches marked the service's
birthday Tuesday.
   In Parliament, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, shouting above
opposition jeers, denied she is bent on dismantling the cornerstone
of the welfare state.
   Labor lawmakers recalled with pride the day that a socialist
dream was realized with the establishment of a service designed to
give free health care to every Briton, rich or poor.
   ``The National Health Service is the socialism that people want
and understand,'' Labor Party deputy leader Roy Hattersley told an
anniversary rally in Glasgow, Scotland.
   For their part, health authorities threw parties for the
nation's first babies born free on July 5, 1948, the day the
post-World War II Labor Party government's system of socialized
medicine took effect.
   From costing about $1 billion in 1949, the National Health
Service bill has soared to about $41 billion a year. It narrowly
outstrips defense spending and is the second biggest item of state
spending, behind social security.
   With 1.2 million staff from cleaners to brain surgeons, the
service is also the biggest employer in Western Europe.
   It provides treatment from flu shots to heart transplants for a
million patients a year. Only 10 percent of Britons choose private
treatment.
   Doctors who pioneered the system recalled Tuesday how its birth
ended the fear of being ill and penniless.
   ``I remember the patients I had tried to visit at home who might
not answer the door because a young doctor's visit wasn't worth the
cost they could ill afford,'' said Sir Anthony Alment, who went on
to become president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists.
   Despite soaring expenditures, the waiting list for hospital beds
is about 700,000. There are periodic national furors, such as last
winter when a child died after a long wait for heart surgery at a
Birmingham hospital.
   Since she came to power in 1979, the health service has been a
sensitive topic for Mrs. Thatcher.
   Mrs. Thatcher regularly reels off statistics showing that health
spending has risen by nearly one-third since she took office. But a
common perception of cuts by the Conservatives remains.
   She has ordered a wide-ranging review of the health service
which is due to be released this autumn.
   The move, and ideas being bandied about such as hospital stay
charges and tax breaks for private health insurance, have increased
suspicions that she is aiming to reduce state health care to a
second-rate system for the poorest.
   Britain spends less than most other Western democracies on
health _ about 6 percent of its gross national product _ compared
with 10.5 percent consumed by the United States' mainly private
system, and 9.2 percent in West Germany.
   The Conservative government argues the figures are a tribute to
the efficiency of the British system.
   The British Medical Association, the doctors' main professional
body, disagrees.
   ``There is, in our view, a major crisis in the health service,''
association chairman Dr. John Marks said this week, urging the
government to increase its funding of the service. ``The
government, of course, maintains there is no such crisis. Most of
us, like most of our patients, prefer the evidence of our own
eyes.''

   Vote fraud has become both art and science in
Mexico, where voters sometimes register with vanishing ink and
polling places may mysteriously move to new locations.
   Most of the tampering is blamed on supporters of the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has won every presidential
election since the party was founded in 1929.
   For today's general election, however, thousands of opposition
supporters planned to oversee polling places in the most ambitious
effort yet to prevent fraud, the dominant issue of the campaign.
   The opposition credits the governing party's string of victories
at least in part to fraud. The Institutional Revolutionary Party
insists it has won honestly because of its overwhelming popularity
and masterful organization.
   President Miguel de la Madrid, in a nationally broadcast message
Monday, pledged to guarantee fair elections. He said ``it is a
commitment of the government of the republic to comply strictly
with the law.''
   Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the governing party candidate, is
favored to defeat the two other major candidates, Manuel J.
Clouthier of the National Action Party and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of
the National Democratic Front.
   In hopes of neutralizing vote fraud this year, a citizen
watchdog group with opposition backing has issued a handbook for
poll workers.
   In it, the Democratic Assembly for Effective Suffrage outlines
what it says are 20 ways to cheat.
   It explains things like ``strolling ballot boxes,'' or polling
places which move from their assigned sites, confounding opposition
supporters looking for a place to vote.
   It warns of ``galloping armies of voters'' who dash from one
polling place to the next, using phony registration cards or
signing in with ink that later fades, erasing signs of multiple
voting.
   Beware, the manual warns, of ``vote tacos'' _ ballots crammed
with extra ballots.
   During the counting process, it says, expert forgers go to work
on phony tally sheets in secret ``falsification bunkers.''
   The bunkers, the manual says, work in tandem with clandestine
``alchemy workshops'' where experts at computer terminals linked to
the Interior Ministry, the National Voter Registry and
Institutional Revolutionary Party offices monitor the tallies from
each polling place.
   Political parties are allowed to have workers on duty at the
polls and the manual tries to give them what it calls ``antidotes''
to fraud.
   These generally boil down to vigilance and to alerting the
public if something seems amiss.
   But the watchdog group admits helplessness in its ability to
monitor the government's computerized electoral roll and the voter
credentials it issues.
   ``Neither the citizens nor the (opposition) parties possess the
technological capability to outdo the National Voter Registry in
its ability to perform an endless series of tricks and produce
unlimited versions of the electoral roll.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration says
consumers should be careful not to indiscriminately use the
prescription acne drug Retin-A to reduce wrinkles.
   Along with the consumer warning issued by the agency on Tuesday
came a warning that the agency is beginning a crackdown on
unlicensed manufacturers that have started to advertise and
distribute bogus drugs identified as Retin-A.
   ``Use of all these products amounts to an expensive therapeutic
gamble,'' FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young said in a statement.
   ``Long-term animal studies and well-controlled clinical trials
involving larger numbers of patients in various age groups are
needed to assess the risks and benefits of Retin-A as a wrinkle
reducer,'' Young said.
   Retin-A, manufactured by Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp. of Raritan,
N.J., has long been approved to treated acne and normally is
applied to small areas of the skin for limited periods of time, but
the drug received nationwide attention earlier this year when a
research article published in a mainstream medical journal
suggested it could reduce or reverse wrinkling due to aging and sun
damage.

<HEAD>Farm Credit System Announces Merger of Nine Banks</HEAD>

   Officials of the Farm Credit System say nine

   The merger decision was announced Tuesday in Denver and
Washington by the Farm Credit Council, an arm of the Farm Credit
System, a $50 billion network of borrower-owned cooperatives that
taken together represent the nation's largest farm lender.
   The Farm Credit System, which was established in 1933, has been
rocked by financial problems in recent years. The 13 banks for
cooperatives _ 12 based on regional districts and one central bank
located in Denver _ are one component of the system.

<HEAD>Report Says Commandos Will Not Attend IRA Gibraltar Inquest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WEST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British commandos who killed three unarmed IRA
guerrillas in Gibraltar four months ago will not attend the inquest
there because doing so could endanger their lives, newspaper
reports said today.
   The Times of London said the seven commandos involved will not
go because Gibraltar coroner Felix Pizzarello, in a preliminary
ruling Tuesday, rejected conditions drawn up by Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's government for concealing their identities.
   The seven belong to the British Army's Special Air Service
regiment. The elite undercover unit is hated by the Irish
Republican Army because of its deadly efficiency in killing
guerrillas inside and outside Northern Ireland.
   The Times quoted unidentified government sources as saying the
government decided not to send the agents to Gibraltar because they
``could not possibly risk being seen by anyone else other than the
coroner.''
   The Thatcher government had demanded the men only be interviewed
by Pizzarello. The coroner refused to comply.
   Speaking during a visit to Northern Ireland, Defense Secretary
George Younger said Tuesday it was for the seven commandos and
their lawyers to decide whether or not to attend the inquest, which
Pizzarello ruled will open in Gibraltar on Sept. 6.
   But The Times said today: ``Effectively, the government has
already decided that they should not appear.''
   Legislator Michael Mates said he was distressed that Pizzarello
had suggested no harm could come to the agents if they were seen
and identified by lawyers at the inquest.
   Mates, a member of Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative Party and
chairman of the House of Commons all-party defense select
committee, said it was possible the lawyers could be intimidated by
the IRA into giving descriptions of the commandos.
   The seven soldiers cannot be forced to attend because though
Gibraltar off the southern tip of Spain is a British colony, it has
its own local government and courts system and the inquest is
outside mainland British jurisdiction.
   The IRA admitted that guerrillas Mairead Farrell, Daniel McCann,
and Sean Savage were on ``active service'' in Gibraltar when they
were killed by the commandos on March 6.
   Active service is an IRA euphemism for gun and bomb attacks.
   British authorities said they were plotting a car bomb attack on
a British Army parade.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA wants to end British rule in
predominantly Protestant Northern Ireland and unite it with
overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic under socialist rule.
   Prime Minister Charles Haughey's government in the Republic of
Ireland has criticized the slayings on grounds the commandos
apparently made no attempt to arrest the guerrillas.
   The slayings triggered violence in Catholic areas of Northern
Ireland in which two British soldiers and seven other people were
killed.
   Alleged eyewitnesses said in a Thames Television documentary
that the guerrillas were shot as two apparently tried to surrender
and the third attempted to flee.
   This appeared to contradict a statement by Foreign Secretary Sir
Geoffrey Howe the day after the shootings. He told Parliament the
three were challenged as they walked toward the nearby Spanish
border and were slain because they ``made movements which led
security personnel to believe their lives were in danger.''

   A circus hit by the drought in its hay bills is
planning a special performance to benefit Midwest farmers hurt by
stunted crops.
   Circus Flora, a St. Louis-based troupe patterned after traveling
circuses of the 19th century, hopes to raise $20,000 to $30,000 for
needy farmers tonight, spokesman Joshua Leeds said Tuesday. The
circus features high-wire and trapeze acts, stunt riders on
horseback, clowns and trained animals.
   The drought hit home recently when the circus was unable to buy
enough hay locally to feed Flora, a 7-year-old baby elephant for
which the circus is named, Leeds said. The cost of a bale of hay
has risen from $1 to $5 in the past month, members said.
   ``Our baby elephant, horses and buffalo are eating expensive,
out-of-region hay, with imminent shortages anticipated,'' Leeds
said. ``The cost of our groceries will soon reflect the domino
effect of this farming crisis.''
   Proceeds from tonight's ``Drought-Aid'' show will go to two
relief agencies, the Inter-Faith Coalition for the Rural Crisis in
St. Louis and the St. Louis Area Food Bank, Leeds said. In
addition, part of the proceeds from circus performances running
through Saturday night also will go to rural families.
   The circus, which has completed the first half of its summer
tour with performances in Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri and
South Carolina, will hold nightly performances at Union Station
through Saturday.
   Roger Allison, director of the Missouri Rural Crisis Center,
said Missouri farmland has received 7 to 8 inches less rain than
normal this year. The corn crop needs an inch of rain immediately
``to put kernel on the cob,'' Allison said.

<HEAD>Elderly Japanese To Reach One-Fourth Of Population By 2025: Report</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates throughout to include current life expectancy.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In less than 50 years, one-fourth of the Japanese
population will be 65 or older, straining the medical resources of
a country that enjoys one of the world's longest life expectancies,
a report says.
   A projection from the Population Research Institute at Nihon
University also says the average Japanese male will live 78 years
and the average woman 83.6 years by 2025, newspapers reported today.
   United Nations figures show Japanese men can now expect to live
an average 75.4 years, and Japanese women 81.1 years.
   Three times more Japanese _ over 1.1 million people _ will be
bedridden by that year than are now, and more than 2 million will
suffer from senility, the institute said.
   Japan's elderly now account for about a tenth of its total
population. Improved living conditions and a low birthrate are
among the causes of increasing longevity and a growing percentage
of old people in Japan.

<HEAD>Chile Blasts European Plan To Monitor Presidential Ballot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Foreign Ministry has denounced as
``grotesque'' the European Parliament's decision to monitor Chile's
presidential vote.
   A ministry statement, read by spokesman Carlos Ducci, said the
parliament's members exhibited ``ignorance and a distorted
appreciation of the Chilean institutional process.''
   The parliament on Tuesday approved a proposal by French deputy
Frances Andres Savi and agreed to create a special mission to
monitor the Chilean political campaign and balloting.
   The action represents ``a shocking attempt to unnaturally
intervene in the Chilean people's own affairs,'' the ministry said.
``It is grotesque.''
   Chile's military government plans a yes-or-no ballot later this
year on a single presidential candidate, to be picked by the heads
of the armed forces and national police.
   It will be the first presidential ballot since President Augusto
Pinochet, the right-wing army commander, seized power in a 1973
coup.
   No precise date has yet been established, nor has a candidate
been picked. Pinochet is expected to be the nominee.
   Pinochet's critics, along with the local Roman Catholic church,
have charged that his government is not giving proponents of a
``no'' vote equal access to television and other mass media.
   They also accuse him of using government resources to promote a
``yes'' vote and suppress dissent.
   Several opponents have called on the international community to
pressure Pinochet into providing fairer election conditions.

<TEXT>
   A diamond heart-shaped pendant and necklace that
Arlene Francis has worn for more than 40 years was snatched from
her neck by a thief as she walked down a midtown Manhattan avenue.
   The heart, a gift from her late husband Martin Gabel on their
first anniversary, is ``very valuable,'' the 79-year-old radio and
television personality said.
   But more important, she said, is the sentimental value she
places on the necklace, stolen Tuesday.
   ``He's gone, and now it, too, is gone,'' Ms. Francis told the
New York Post.
   Ms. Francis, best known for her quarter-century stint as a
panelist on the TV game show ``What's My Line?'' said she never
took the necklace off.
   Her attachment to the piece was so evident that viewers of the
television show and jewelry designers noticed, triggering a diamond
heart fad in the mid-1950s.

<TEXT>
   Caribbean leaders say U.S. drug
policy has allowed Washington to meddle in the affairs of other
nations, including Panama and Caribbean countries.
   The prime ministers, meeting Tuesday for the ninth summit of the
Caribbean Community and Common Market, condemned drug trafficking
but criticized U.S. efforts to halt it, said Lester Bird, deputy
prime minister of Antigua-Barbuda and spokesman for the closed-door
meetings.
   Bird said ministers ``determined that the question of the
Justice Department in the United States seemingly wishing to have
its writ to run sovereign countries outside its territory is a
development which is of deep concern to the heads of government.''
   He said that while the ministers specifically discussed the case
of Panama, they also were concerned about similar situations
developing in Caribbean nations.
   The leaders plan to send a statement to President Reagan
``expressing our concern for what we see is a derrogation from the
rule of law within our territories,'' Bird said.
   Caribbean nations are poor and unable to wage a full-scale
battle against drugs and need outside help, the leaders agreed. The
issue, mentioned only briefly, was to be discussed further today,
Bird said.
   Prime Minister Sir Lynden Pindling of the Bahamas has been
investigated by a Florida grand jury in connection with allegations
of drug trafficking in the Bahamas.
   The United States has used economic sanctions in its attempt to
make Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega step down as that
country's de facto leader. Noriega was indicted in Florida earlier
this year for alleged drug trafficking.
   The Caribbean Common Market, formed in 1973 to promote trade
among its members, includes Antigua-Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados,
Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Montserrat, St.
Kitts-Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and
Trinidad and Tobago.

   A severe earthquake hit
the northern islands of Papua New Guinea in the Pacific Ocean early
today, but there were no reports of major damage.
   The geophysical laboratory in Port Moresby reported a quake
registering 6.2 on the Richter scale and centered about 35 miles
west of Kandrian in West New Britain.
   It was felt as far away as Port Moresby about 320 miles to the
south, said laboratory spokesman Horst Letz.
   Letz said several aftershocks had been recorded but no serious
damage had resulted.
   The Hong Kong Royal Observatory earlier reported the quake had
measured 6.7 on the Richter scale.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.
   An earthquake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in
populated areas, while one measuring 7 is considered a major quake
capable of widespread heavy damage.

   The sleek G-15 computer had all the
latest features: a reel-to-reel tape drive and punched-paper
software in two refrigerator-sized units, and a Teletype, all in
decorator robins' egg blue.
   In 1954, it was a state of the art marvel of compactness and
practibility, and at $50,000, a bargain to boot. It's inventor says
it just may have been the first personal computer.
   ``I like to think so. It was the first one you could put in a
regular office ... and let one person handle,'' the G-15's creator,
Harry D. Huskey, said Tuesday.
   The Smithsonian Institution agrees. It is acquiring Husky's own
model of the computer, manufactured by Bendix.
   ``We think it was a landmark device in shaping the computer
industry,'' said David Allison, chief curator of the Smithsonian's
Computer, Information and Society exhibit, planned for March 1990.
   ``It was the packaging of the hardware that made it important,''
he said.
   Huskey, 71, developed the G-15 over a period of several years,
beginning in 1952, while he was at Wayne University in Detroit on a
year's leave from the U.S. Bureau of Standards. He later sold the
design to Bendix.
   ``This was back at a time when the (computers) that worked were
all large ones in the million-dollar class,'' Huskey recalled in a
telephone interview. Huskey used a magnetic drum similar to today's
floppy disks for a memory instead of vacuum tubes then in use.
   His computer was dubbed G-15 _ G for general use and 15 to make
prospective buyers think there were more models, Huskey said.
Bendix, which thought it would sell only about 200, actually sold
400.
   ``Bendix was so happy at time, the chrome fittings (on the 400th
G-15) were gold plated,'' Huskey said. He said he doesn't know what
happened to that model.

   A rare French donkey born on the Fourth
of July has been dubbed Lafayette by its owners _ in honor of the
French general who served in the Continental army in the American
Revolution.
   ``He looks like a toy and has tiny feet,'' owner Sharon
Vanderlip said of the newborn. ``He's really sweet. He follows you
all around the place, kind of like a puppy.''
   Vanderlip believes that the 50-pound Lafayette is the first
Poitou donkey born in the United States. There are only 40 Poitous
worldwide, she said.
   ``This really is a critical moment in time for this breed, so it
was a very exciting experience. ... So far, he looks healthy. But
we've got our fingers crossed,'' she said.
   Vanderlip and her husband, Jack, both veterinarians in San Diego
County, have four other Poitous _ Sonette, Lafayette's mother;
Tartarin, his father; a third male named Tabarin, and a second
female Tosca. All were imported from France.
   Sonette, now 4, drew attention in late 1984 when U.S.
Agriculture Department officials ordered her destroyed or deported
for failing tests designed to detect equine disease.
   The Vanderlips and others criticized the nearly eight-decade old
testing procedures as outdated and unfair to donkeys and other
exotic equines, which have an unusual substance in their blood. The
outcry prompted a change in testing methods and allowed Sonette to
remain in the United States.
   Vanderlip said she and her husband had hoped for a female for
breeding purposes, but added: ``We're happy we have a live baby and
will take what we get. What we will do is breed Sonette again and
try for a female again.''

   The dollar fell against the Japanese yen today in
slow trading in Tokyo, while stock prices rose substantially.
   The dollar closed at 133.53 yen on the Tokyo Foreign Exchange
Market, down 0.77 yen from Tuesday's close. It opened at 133.45 and
traded between 133.30 yen and 133.88 yen during the day.
   Volume totaled $7.44 billion today, compared with $11.57 billion
the day before.
   The dollar went up to 134.85 yen Monday, the highest closing
rate since last Nov. 24, then dropped for two consecutive days.
   Dealers said dollar-selling pressure pervaded the market in the
wake of the U.S. currency's weakening against the yen and the West
German mark on overseas markets.
   An official of the Bank of Tokyo, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the market was dull in anticipation of the
announcement of U.S. unemployment figures, expected on Friday.
   On the Tokyo Stock market, the Nikkei stock average of 225
selected issues, the market's main barometer, rose by 189.43 or
0.69 percent, to close at 27,766.60 points.
   Trade volume totaled 2.8 billion shares, up from 1.5 billion
shares on Tuesday.
   An official of Nomura Securities, Japan's largest brokerage
house, said the rise in stock prices here reflected the increase in
the New York stock market.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, added that
investors now believe the dollar will not advance further against
the Japanese yen.

<HEAD>Party Demands End to Interference in Farming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL PUTZEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delegates to the national Communist Party
conference want state and collective farms to operate with less
meddling from party and government bureaucrats.
   The delegates called for less interference in farm operations in
a resolution adopted at the conference last week and published
Tuesday.
   Among the most frequent criticisms during the conference was the
refrain that despite three years of economic reform programs, few
improvements in living standards are reaching average people.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev said the biggest single
problem was improving food supplies in a country of chronic
shortages and frequent rationing.
   In the resolution, delegates told party and government agencies
to let farms work out their own arrangements with workers and
cooperatives.
   ``Any attempts to command collective and state farms should be
stopped immediately,'' the resolution said, adding that the farms
are capable of solving their problems independently.
   Soviet officials had said before the conference that Gorbachev
hoped for a quick boost in farm production by encouraging state and
collective farms to lease land to individuals and families who
would be permitted to grow what they wish and keep most of their
profits.
   Some experiments suggest family farming could boost Soviet
agricultural productivity by several times.
   The delegates, in their resolution on ``perestroika,'' or
restructuring, as Gorbachev calls his reform program, said the
shortest way to solve the food problem ``is to tap the potential of
the collective and state farms in full.''
   The farms could do this, the resolution said, by ``spreading
diverse forms of contract and lease arrangements (and) building a
far-flung network of cooperatives, both in relations with other
enterprises and sections of the economy.''
   Attacking the often-criticized Soviet labor force for working
too little and producing shoddy goods, the resolution said the
party must overcome the tendency to pay everyone the same wage,
regardless of who performs best.
   The Soviet system of full employment, low rent, heavily
subsidized basic foods and fully paid health care is often cited
for discouraging individual initiative and tolerating poor
performance.
   ``We must make people much more interested in a better end
result,'' the resolution said, ``utterly overcome equalization
tendencies, adhere more boldly and everywhere to the principle of
compensating work in accordance with its quantity and _ especially
_ quality, to rule out a possiblity of living a comfortable life
while doing shoddy work.''
   In a separate document attacking ``petty patronism'' and
unresponsive, inconsiderate and overcautious bureaucrats, the
delegates proposed to tie managers' salaries to ``the
cost-effective results of the work performed by individual
industries, enterprises, organizations and territories.''
   The delegates issued what amounts to a license for the
state-controlled press to root out ``manifestations of bureaucratic
attitudes.''
   Apparently offering encouragement to would-be humorists, the
resolution added: ``The potential of the genre of satire should be
fully used in combating the negative phenomena.''

   A prominent neurologist was arrested on a
weapons charge after shooting a former patient who broke into his
Fifth Avenue office in Manhattan, police said.
   The patient, Jay Shaheri, was also arrested Tuesday on burglary
and attempted assault charges, police said.
   According to police, Shaheri, 38, was dissatisfied with
treatment by Dr. David Coddon after an accident in which the
unemployed waiter was struck by a woman who committed suicide by
jumping from a building.
   A $20 million lawsuit Shaheri filed against the woman's estate
was settled last week for $500,000.
   Shaheri was angry over Coddon's testimony in the case, and
apparently owed him $6,000 for treatment, said the physician's
lawyer, Harry Lipsig.
   Shaheri, carrying a 3-foot cane, went to Coddon's office
Tuesday, and began pounding on a locked door. He then punched
through a glass door, opened the door and began pounding on another
door, police said.
   At that point, Coddon, 65, retreated to a conference room and
locked the door. Shaheri broke into the conference room and
approached Coddon, who fired once, hitting the man in the left
side, said Aaron Rosenthal, Manhattan chief of detectives.
   ``I didn't want to kill him. I just wanted to stop him,'' the
doctor said.
   Shaheri was in stable condition at Mount Sinai Hospital.
   Police said Shaheri, who has said he is having financial
difficulties, has threatened Coddon.
   The 65-year-old doctor, an author and expert on headaches, runs
the Headache Clinic at Mount Sinai. He was charged with illegal
weapon possession, police said.
   Coddon, of Englewood, N.J., is licensed to carry his .38-caliber
handgun in New Jersey but not in New York.

agribusiness companies could lead to severe shortages in national
food supplies.
   ``What's on the line in this drought is the future of the family
farm system,'' said Dixon Terry, a Greenfield farmer and spokesman
for the Iowa Farm Unity Coalition. The coalition is made up of
farm, church and labor groups.
   ``What looks to be the worst drought of the century is made
worse by a failure of farm policy,'' Terry said Tuesday as the
group urged federal officials to investigate the handling of grain
reserve programs.
   Terry and other leaders of the group held a news conference in
front of a federal office building in Des Moines to underscore farm
policies they said have aggravated troubles for farmers,
particularly livestock producers.
   They called for an immediate end to subsidies designed to boost
exports, with that money shifted to drought assistance.
   In those subsidy programs, the government makes up the
difference between what grain sells for in the United States and
what it costs in other countries.
   The coalition claims such programs keep prices low, permitting
large sales and profits from grain reserves by grain giants such as
Cargill and ConGgra on the highly competitive international market.
Terry said reserves have been drained at the time when they may be
needed by drought-stricken livestock farmers who are short of feed.
   At ConAgra's Omaha, Neb., headquarters, spokeswoman Lynn Phares
said: ``We have seen no big new profits in grain merchandising
because of the drought.''
   She said her company tends to do well when farmers do well, not
when times are tough in agriculture.
   A spokesman at Minneapolis-based Cargill declined to comment.
   ``We've given away farm commodities on a fire-sale basis,''
Terry said. ``After all this cost to the taxpayers, we may have a
need for these commodities.''
   Gary Lamb, a Chelsea farmer and president of the Iowa Farmers
Union, warned, ``We could see dramatic shortages in food supplies
around the country.''

<HEAD>Powerful Thunderstorms Over the Plains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Powerful thunderstorms boomed over the northern Plains today
after unleashing as many as five tornados in North Dakota and
Montana that destroyed a barn and other buildings.
   Thunderstorms brought brief heavy rain to drought-hit eastern
sections of North Dakota and northwest Minnesota.
   Scattered thunderstorms rumbled from the northwest Texas
Panhandle to southwest New Mexico, and widely scattered showers and
thunderstorms fell along the Gulf Coast into central Floria.
   As many as four tornadoes were reported Tuesday in Montana,
including one that touched down southeast of Big Sandy, destroying
a barn, a bunkhouse and other buildings. Twisters were also sighted
near Westby, Fort Benton and Langdon. Near Ulm, strong thunderstorm
winds destroyed a barn and moved a large trailer 60 feet.
   In North Dakota, a tornado was reported near Wales, hail 1{
inches in diameter fell near Fordville and winds gusted to 85 mph.
   Heavier rainfall in six hours overnight included nearly 2 inches
at Grand Forks, N.D., more than 1\ inches in the Dallas-Fort Worth
area and more than an inch at Barksdale Air Force Base near
Shreveport, La.
   A new heat wave baked the Midwest with temperatures over 100
degrees in some places Tuesday. Temperature records were broken in
13 cities and tied in eight.
   Today's forecast called for hot, humid weather prevailing in the
eastern two-thirds of the nation; scattered showers and
thunderstorms over Florida and from lower Alabama to the southern
Great Plains, with showers most numerous in Louisiana and southwest
Alabama; widely scattered showers and thunderstorms over the Rocky
Mountain states and over most of New England and New York; and a
few showers over the Pacific Northwest.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 80s or 90s in most of
the nation; 100 degrees in parts of the northern and central Great
Plains and western Minnesota; over 110 degrees in the desert
Southwest; and 60s or 70s from the northern Rockies to the Pacific
Northwest and along the California Coast.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 45
degrees at Baker and Burns, Ore., and McCall, Idaho, to 95 degrees
at Phoenix, Ariz.

<HEAD>Five Supreme Court Judges Suspended From Office</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARI S. MANIAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir
Mohamad today suspended five supreme court judges in another move
indicating a growing rift between the prime minister and the
judiciary.
   The five were the same judges who on Saturday issued an order
that an international tribunal appointed by the king last month to
investigate and remove Malaysia's highest ranking judge cease
giving any ``recommendation, report or advice'' on the case to the
king.
   Mahathir suspended Lord President Mohamed Salleh Abas on May 31,
saying the Yang Di-Pertuan Agong (King) Sultan Mahmood Iskandar had
so requested.
   He said the king had asked that a tribunal be appointed to
investigate Salleh after Salleh wrote to the king early this year.
   With the suspension of the five today and the Lord President on
May, only five judges remain on the Supreme Court bench.
   Salleh said he complained in a May 29 letter to the king about
Mahathir's constant attacks on the judiciary. He also said that
during a meeting with Mahathir on May 27 the prime minister told
him he had been biased on some cases connected with Mahathir's
United Malays National Organization political party.
   Mahathir has denied referring to the political party issue in
the talks.
   In February, the high court ruled that Mahathir's party was
illegal because it had branches that were not registered with the
authorities as required by law. Since then, Mahathir has set up a
new party called ``New UMNO'' and has been busy recruiting his old
members.
   All judges are appointed by the king, who is a constitutional
monarch like Britain's Queen Elizabeth, in consultation with the
prime minister. Only the king can remove judges from office.
   The international tribunal can only make recommendations.
   The Malaysian bar council expressed ``shock, concern and
dismay'' over the suspension.

<HEAD>`Zebra' Killing Convict Denied Parole Fourth Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man convicted in San
Francisco's ``Zebra'' killings lost a fourth bid for freedom after
telling a parole board he will never confess to the 1970s murder
spree that left 14 people dead.
   The three-member Board of Prison Terms denied parole for Manuel
Moore, 40, after a 2{-hour hearing Tuesday at the California Men's
Colony in San Luis Obispo.
   The panel said Moore presents an unreasonable risk of danger,
and concluded that he committed the crimes in an especially
heinous, cruel, cold-blooded and calculated manner, panel member
Ray Jaurequi said.
   Another man convicted in the killings, Larry Green, faces a
parole hearing later today.
   The panel characterized the crimes as a murderous rampage that
terrorized the San Francisco Bay area.
   Moore, who is serving a life term and cannot seek parole for
another three years, maintained his innocence throughout the
hearing.
   ``I'm not going to say I did something when I didn't do it,''
Moore said. ``You all can keep whipping me and whipping me, I'm not
going to submit. I don't care how much you whip me and beat me,
I'll pick myself up every time and tell you I didn't do it.''
   A prosecutor said Moore has never admitted guilt nor expressed
remorse for the random street killings of whites that left 14 dead
and eight injured in the winter of 1973-74.
   ``I have no doubt he would do it again if he was set free. This
is the same man who went out on the streets of San Francisco
shooting people. He hasn't changed,'' said Assistant District
Attorney Theresa Welch of San Francisco.
   Moore, Green, J.C. Simon and Jessie Lee Cooks were convicted in
1976 of murder, conspiracy and assault after a year-long trial.
   They were charged in only some of the Zebra attacks, but all 14
murders and eight assaults were introduced at the yearlong trial
because of the conspiracy charges. All received life sentences.
   The murder victims included a woman who was beheaded with a
machete, an 81-year-old man and a 19-year-old college student
carrying a teddy bear as a Christmas present.
   One survivor was San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos, who was shot and
wounded on on Dec. 13, 1973. Agnos was a private citizen at the
time.
   The case took its name from the Z, or ``Zebra,'' police radio
frequency that was used during the investigation of the killings.
Prosecutors argued that the attacks were the work of a black racist
cult bent on slaying whites.

   A hot line offering information on AIDS lit up
with more than 240,000 calls in the three weeks since the federal
government began mailing out brochures on the deadly disease to 107
million American homes.
   Since the brochures were mailed out May 26, figures through June
19 indicated that 241,735 calls were placed to the line, said Fred
Kroger, acting director of the National AIDS Information Program at
the Centers for Disease Control.
   The number of calls ``is unprecedented. No other health line has
ever received that call volume,'' he said Tuesday. ``It is a pace
larger than anything anybody anticipated. It confirms the fact that
many people have many questions about AIDS.''
   The government has projected 2.2 million calls for a 12-month
period following the mailing of the brochures, he said. The
brochures describe what is known about the disease and how it can
be contracted.

   China announced regulations today designed to
lure Taiwanese investors to the mainland to ``tap the potential
here and make money.''
   The word comes a day before Taiwan's governing Nationalist Party
holds a crucial congress at which it will discuss relaxing its ban
on trade with the mainland.
   The 22 regulations consolidate rules on tax breaks and other
incentives already offered by many coastal provinces and cities
closest to Taiwan, whose residents have covertly invested millions
of dollars on the mainland.
   ``We welcome Taiwan business people to come and tap the
potential here and make money, and we would like to learn from
their expertise,'' Yuan Mu, spokesman for the State Council,
China's cabinet, told a news conference in the Great Hall of the
People.
   ``It is profitable for (Taiwan residents) to come and invest
here,'' he said. ``The cost of production in Taiwan is rising. Some
Taiwanese capital needs to find outlets to other parts of the
world.''
   Taiwan has been estranged from the mainland since 1949, when the
Nationalists under Chiang Kai-shek lost a civil war to the
Communists. Chiang and thousands of followers fled to Taiwan, about
100 miles off the southeast coast, and set up a rival government.
   After decades of banning all contacts with the mainland, the
Nationalists last year began allowing Taiwan residents to visit
close relatives there. This spring, Taiwan began to permit mail
exchanges via the international Red Cross.
   Although Taiwan still bars trade and investment ties, many
Taiwanese businessmen secretly have invested in their mainland
ancestral homes. Two-way indirect trade totalled about $1.51
billion last year.
   The Nationalist congress is to consider allowing the indirect
import of raw materials such as coal from the mainland.
   The Communist government's investment regulations clearly were
timed to provoke debate at the session and encourage younger
Nationalists to press for faster liberalization.
   Beijing regards relatively prosperous Taiwan as a valuable
source of needed capital and technology and has said repeatedly it
is willing to forget the civil war legacy of hatred.
   The regulations generally treat Taiwanese the same as any
foreign investor, though Shen Jueren, vice minister of the Ministry
of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, told the news conference
that terms are slightly more favorable.
   They guarantee the right to remit profits in convertible
currency, promise that no assets will be nationalized and exempt
Taiwan-funded enterprises from import and export taxes when they
manufacture goods for export.
   Taiwanese may develop land in coastal areas of the mainland, set
up wholly owned companies, enter into joint ventures with mainland
companies, buy stock or shares in mainland companies and engage in
compensation trade, the regulations say.

   A tax shelter promoter who lost
millions of dollars for dozens of investors faces up to 207 years
in prison and $8 million in fines after being convicted of
masterminding fraud and racketeering schemes.
   Following a three-month trial, jurors deliberated for nine days
before finding John Peter Galanis guilty Tuesday of 44 counts,
including racketeering, tax fraud, securities fraud, bank fraud,
bribery and criminal contempt.
   Galanis, 44, who resides in Manhattan and Greenwich, Conn., is
scheduled to be sentenced Sept. 20 by U.S. District Judge Charles
Brieant.
   One co-defendant, Anthony Marchese, 47, of Southport, Conn., was
convicted of racketeering and bribery involving the now-defunct
Peoples National Bank in Rockland County and the Heritage Bank in
Salt Lake City.
   Marchese faces up to 55 years in prison and $530,000 in fines
when he is sentenced the same day.
   Two other co-defendants, Samuel Rosengarten, 66, of Armonk, and
Arthur Mason, 46, of Chevy Chase, Md., were acquitted of a variety
of counts.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Vincent Briccetti told jurors that
Galanis, who had pleaded guilty to securities fraud 15 years ago,
ran what he called the ``Galanis Organization'' to raise capital
for its members.
   Galanis was convicted of bribing officials of Peoples Bank,
which was forced into insolvency; fraudulently trying to take
control of Heritage Bank, which later was taken over by Utah
banking officials; seizing control of Columbia Federal Savings Bank
in Westport, Conn., through fraudulent misrepresentation to federal
regulators; and illegally taking over ISI Mutual Funds in Oakland,
Calif., and stealing $4 million in mutual fund assets.
   Galanis also was convicted of creating a syndication known as
Transpac Drilling Venture which promised investors grossly inflated
tax losses that could be used to reduce their income tax
liabilities.
   The 2,500 investors in the oil drilling business received more
than $172 million in fraudulent partnership losses between 1982 and
1984.
   Eleven other people pleaded guilty for their roles in Galanis'
various schemes and nine testified against him, Briccetti said.

<DATELINE>SALEM, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bomber's incompetence probably saved Salem
from explosions that could have damaged six bridges serving this
southern Indiana city as well as offices and businesses,
authorities said.
   At least 13 improperly wired bombs were discovered Tuesday, but
only three of them had ignited, producing only smoke and small
fires. Army bomb disposal units defused the others. There were no
injuries and no suspects.
   ``They used black powder as the cap, and it didn't detonate,''
said Paul Lyles, emergency management director for the Washington
County Department of Civil Defense. ``Luckily, the guy who put it
there didn't know much about explosives.''
   The bomber either lacked the expertise to properly wire the
bombs or did not have an essential component, said Capt. Ronald V.
Downing, an Army spokesman. He did not elaborate.
   The devices, which contained timers attached to as many as 26
sticks of gelatin dynamite, were all packaged in paper grocery
sacks and concealed next to bridges or buildings in this town of
6,000 people.
   Mayor Frank Newkirk Sr., who found one of the bombs next to a
bridge, said it ``was obviously an act of terrorism in my book,
certainly done by a wacko.''
   Morris Strange, who lives across from the service station, said
he arrived home to find officials surrounding it as they searched
for more bombs.
   ``Of course I was scared. You don't expect this to happen in any
town in the U.S. This isn't the Middle East,'' Strange said.
   A transient found under one of the bridges was taken in for
questioning but later released, police said.
   ``We have no indications of any motive at this time. We have no
suspects,'' said state police Sgt. Marvin Jenkins. ``Due to the
fact no one has been injured and there's no property damage yet,
we're very strongly hoping this is just a poor joke.''
   Portions of the city, which is surrounded by the Blue River and
Brock Creek, were evacuated and sealed off as bomb squads from Fort
Benjamin Harrison in Indianapolis and Fort Knox in Kentucky defused
the bombs.
   The devices were turned over to agents of the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms, which was investigating along with the Army,
FBI, state police and local agencies.

<TEXT>
   Israel will investigate a complaint that its
security agents posed as an ABC news crew so they could arrest a
Palestinian youth, a government spokesman said today.
   The television network made the allegation public on Tuesday and
demanded an investigation.
   ``We are going to check the whole issue,'' said Avi Pazner, an
aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. ``I can not tell now what
our response will be.''
   ``My first reaction was amazement over the strange way in which
the complaint was passed,'' Pazner added. ``A messenger brought it
to my house at 2 a.m. I find it strange that somebody has ordered
the complaint to be delivered at such an hour, as if a war has
started.''
   Dean Reynolds, ABC's Israel correspondent, said the network
learned about the incident on June 26, two days after it allegedly
occurred, and complained to the Israeli police, army and prime
minister's office.
   He said the network decided to make the complaint public after
receiving no satisfactory response.
   ``There have been other reports of this happening to other
agencies,'' Reynolds said. ``The central issue here is the danger
it puts my cameramen in'' should Palestinians think his crew is
Israeli security agents.
   ABC News President Roone Arledge sent a protest by telex Tuesday
to Shamir.
   ABC World News Tonight reported Tuesday that the phony news crew
had arrested a 17-year-old youth named Nizar Dakdouk of the
occupied West Bank village of Salfit.
   ABC News said it learned that ``the impostors were members of
the Israeli secret security service, Shin Bet.''
   Israeli troops demolished Dakdouk's home on June 16, saying the
youth had thrown a firebomb at a bus, the report said.
   The youth and his mother complained the next day on Israeli
television that if he was suspected of something the army should
have arrested him before blowing up the house, ABC said.
   A week after the TV appearance, Israeli civilians posing as ABC
News personnel arrived at the Dakdouk family's temporary housing in
two cars and said they wanted to interview Dakdouk and his brother
on the site of the destroyed house, the report said. The boys
agreed to go.
   At the site, one of the cars sped off with Dakdouk and he was
later arrested, ABC said.

   WINDHOEK, South-West Africa (AP) _ One black man was killed and
18 people injured today when a bomb exploded at a butcher's shop in
Windhoek, police said.
   Two victims were in critical condition and four additional
people were seriously injured, said police spokesman Kierie du Rand.
   Du Rand said it appeared an explosive device placed inside a
parcel was left in the butcher's shop, which was extensively
damaged in the blast. An adjoining shop also was damaged and
shattered windows and debris littered the street, witnesses said.
   The butcher's shop is in an affluent white residential area, but
most of the victims were black, including the man who was killed,
du Rand said.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the blast.
   However, police blamed guerrillas of the South West African
People's Organization, who have been waging a bombing and sabotage
campaign for 21 years in a bid to win independence for the
territory, also known as Namibia.
   ``I have no doubt in my mind that SWAPO is responsible,'' du
Rand said.
   South Africa administers South-West Africa in violation of a
1978 United Nations resolution.
   The deadliest bombing in the history of the guerrilla war
occurred Feb. 19, when an explosion at a bank in the north-central
town of Oshakati killed 27.

   More than 11,000 Amerasians and their
relatives have left Vietnam for the United States under a special
program, the U.S. Embassy said today.
   The most recent group consisted of 78 people who arrived in
Bangkok from Ho Chi Minh City on Monday, the embassy said.
   Since the U.N.-sponsored Orderly Departure Program began in
September 1982, a total of 11,058 Vietnamese-American children and
their relatives have left Vietnam, the embassy said.
   An unknown number of others have fled the country as refugees.
   An estimated 8,000 to 12,000 other Amerasians still are living
in Vietnam and the program to relocate those who want to live in
the United States continues.
   Most Amerasians spend less than a week in Bangkok before going
on to a refugee center in the Philippines for English-language
training and orientation to life in the United States. Others go
directly to the United States.
   In most cases, the Amerasians are the offspring of U.S.
servicemen and civilians and Vietnamese women. Usually, the
Americans left their Vietnamese families behind.

   The dollar fell in light European trading early
today as the British pound continued to gain on Monday's increase
in British interest rates. Gold rose.
   Dealers said an overnight bout of profit-taking appeared to have
sputtered out and they expected the dollar to trade in a narrow
range for the rest of the day.
   The dollar continued to be buoyed by increased tension in the
Persian Gulf following Sunday's downing by the U.S. Navy of an
Iranian civilian jetliner, they said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell to a closing 133.53 Japanese yen from
134.30 yen at Tuesday's close. Later, in London, it slipped to
133.50 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.8170 West German marks, down from 1.8235
   _1.5105 Swiss francs, down from 1.5165
   _6.1195 French francs, down from 6.1430
   _2.0464 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0600
   _1,347.75 Italian lire, down from 1,355.50
   _1.2120 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2134
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.7150 from $1.7075 late
Tuesday. British commercial banks increased their base lending rate
to 10 percent Monday to stem the pound's five-week slide.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $438.50 an ounce, up
from $437.25 bid late Tuesday. At mid-morning today, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $438.10.
   In Zurich, the noon bid price was $438.20, up from $437.50 bid
late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose to a closing bid price of
$441.05 from $440.41 bid at Tuesday's close.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a bid price of $6.78 an ounce,
up from $6.74 bid late Tuesday.

   Here, at a glance, is a summary of developments Tuesday in the
destruction of an Iranian jetliner over the Persian Gulf by the USS
Vincennes:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>RADIO SIGNALS AT ISSUE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon said the Vincennes captain decided to fire on the
plane in part because the jet was sending out radio signals on two
channels, including a military one ``identified with F-14s'' flown
by the Iranian air force.
   Iran's U.N. ambassador, Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati, countered
that the Airbus A-300, Iran Air Flight 655, had sent ``normal
signals ... to all radar that it was a civilian plane.''

   House Armed Services Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., said military
officials told his panel during a closed-door briefing that the
airliner never left a commercial air corridor, although officials
earlier had said the plane was not in the air corridor. Officials
also disclosed that another American ship in the area concluded the
Iranian A-300 airbus maintained a steady altitude of 12,600 feet,
rather than descending toward the Vincennes as had been reported.

   A six-man team of U.S. experts led by an admiral arrived in the

<HEAD>PREVIOUS PROBLEMS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   American military sources in the Gulf said at least two other
mix-ups between U.S. warships and commercial aircraft had occurred
in the past month. They said one involved a commercial pilot who
thought a Navy ship was ordering him to change course, and in the
second a vessel just arriving in the gulf fixed its fire-control
radar briefly on an airliner.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>U.S.-IRAN CONTACT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration said it communicated with Iran through
private channels that the United States had had ``no intention'' of
shooting down the plane.
   Iran's U.N. ambassador called for an urgent meeting of the
Security Council to condemn the United States for the attack. The
State Department said it would cooperate in an investigation of the
incident by the International Civil Aviation Organization, which
was asked by Iran to undertake a probe.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>COMPENSATING VICTIMS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and Sen. John Warner, R-Va.,
urged the administration to compensate the families of Iran Air
victims. The White House said that the ``first order of business''
must be its investigation of Sunday's attack and that questions of
compensation must wait.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>GULF AIR TRAFFIC</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Iran Air canceled its daily flights from Bandar Abbas to Dubai,
the route of the downed airliner, and said it would not use the
corridor ``threatened by the American naval presence.'' Dubai
canceled flights of other airlines using the same corridor, and air
traffic to Abu Dhabi, 105 miles away, also was affected.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>LEBANON HOSTAGES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In Beirut, a man purporting to speak for Islamic Jihad claimed
the pro-Iranian faction would kill one of two American hostages to
avenge the downing of the Iran Air plane. But police said the
deadline passed without incident.
   Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, a pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem
cleric, said the 18 foreign hostages in Lebanon should not pay the
price for the U.S. Navy's action in the gulf.

   An assailant shot and wounded a
Roman Catholic from a passing car today, then sped after the
fleeing man, fired again and killed him, police said.
   Terry Delaney, 30, was walking to work along a main street in
the market town of Dromore, 17 miles southwest of Belfast, when he
was shot in the head, police said. He was shot several more times
as he ran away, police said.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Delaney's
father, Hugh, said his son belonged to no armed organization.
   Forty people, including 20 civilians, have died in Northern
Ireland this year in political and sectarian violence.
   The almost exclusively Catholic Irish Republican Army is
fighting to push the British out of the Protestant-dominated
province, join it with the Republic of Ireland and set up an
all-Ireland socialist state.
   Town councilor Draw Nelson said local people ``are absolutely
shattered and are in a state of shock. This is the first incident
of this type that has been in Dromore, although there were people
killed in a firebombing at their home many years ago. It is an
appalling crime and totally sickening.''

   North Korea denounced the U.S. Navy's downing of an
Iranian jetliner over the Persian Gulf, in which all 290 people
aboard died, an official report said today.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman issued a statement calling the
incident a ``barbaric massacre'' and ``a hideous crime against the
Iranian people,'' according to the North Korean Central News
Agency, monitored in Tokyo.
   The spokesman, whom the report did not name, termed the attack a
``deliberate provocation to escalate the war in the Persian Gulf.''
   The United States said its forces mistook the civilian jetliner
for an Iranian jet fighter.
   The Foreign Ministry spokesman also accused the United States of
massing military forces in and around South Korea.
   ``No one can vouch that the United States, while leading the
situation on the Korean Peninsula to a higher pitch of strain,
would not commit again some terrorism and provocation against our
republic when it thinks necessary,'' the statement said.
   ``Our people are sharply watching every move of the enemy with
heightened vigilance,'' it added.

<HEAD>High Court Overturns Judge's AIDS Test Order For Mental Patient</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUNCAN MANSFIELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Massachusetts Supreme Court has unanimously
thrown out a probate court judge's order that a mentally retarded
patient at a state school should undergo testing for AIDS.
   The patient, identified by the fictitious name ``Anthony,'' had
not been tested, since the judge's order was stayed by a state
Appeals Court judge pending the high court's decision. The order
also applied to another unidentified male patient who allegedly was
Anthony's sexual partner.
   The Supreme Court said Probate Judge Eliot K. Cohen exceeded his
guardianship authority when he ordered the Walter E. Fernald State
School in Worcester County to have the patients tested.
   Denise McWilliams, who is both Anthony's attorney and director
of the AIDS law project at the Gay and Lesbian Advocates and
Defenders organization in Cambridge, said she was pleased with the
decision but said it was ``very limited in its terms.''
   The justices, she noted, did not consider larger issues
concerning state legal requirements on written informed consent
from patients before tests for acquired immune deficiency syndrome
can be made and their results disseminated.
   The justices said they didn't take up those issues ``because it
is clear that the probate and family court judge did not have
authority to assume control of the department and to order the
department to conduct tests on Anthony and another party.''
   ``The judge, in effect and incorrectly, usurped the function of
the executive branch of the state government,'' according to the
court's decision.
   Mary Breslauer, spokeswoman for the attorney general's office
which represented the state department that operates the
institution, said it was ``gratified that the (high court) agreed
with our position that the trial judge had overstepped his boundary
by ordering an AIDS test.''
   Cohen had ordered Anthony and the other patient to be tested for
AIDS even though that was not the issue before him.
   The state had asked Cohen to amend an earlier court-ordered
medical plan for Anthony so he could have a venereal wart removed.
By the time Cohen heard the case, the wart had disappeared and all
parties concerned, from Anthony's physician to department
officials, asked that the request be dismissed.
   But Cohen concluded in his ruling that the wart, the
unrestrictive setting at the mental health facility and Anthony's
alleged homosexual activity were ``conducive to AIDS and the
potential spread thereof.''
   Cohen ordered Anthony and the other patient to undergo the AIDS
test, contending state officials had ``averted facing the issue of
determining if a major health problem exists'' at the facility.
   But state officials and others at Anthony's hearing said that
``neither Anthony nor any other resident of the (facility) showed
symptoms of AIDS,'' that the facility was developing an AIDS
education program and that AIDS testing was ``not medically
advisable'' for Anthony, the high court said.

   Activists said today that soldiers opened fire on
protesters who shut down the airport in the Armenian capital of
Yerevan and that at least one protester was killed. A Foreign
Ministry spokesman denied the report.
   The Foreign Ministry spokesman, Vadim Perfilyev, told reporters
that soldiers routed 400 protesters from inside the terminal at
Zvartnots airport Tuesday. He said 36 people were hurt in the
confrontation and that one man was killed in another town as a
result of ``hooliganism'' not related to the incident.
   Perfilyev said the protesters threw rocks and bottles at police
and soldiers, according to the news agency Tass.
   Alexi Mananikov, an editor of the unofficial Moscow journal
Glasnost, said 22-year-old Khachik Kazaryan was killed in the
airport confrontation.
   He said sources in Yerevan told him as many as 40 people were
wounded by soldiers trying to reopen the airport Tuesday night.
   Artist Kuryun Nahabidyan, an Armenian activist in Moscow,
reported three unidentified students were killed. ``Officers shot
them with pistols,'' he said.
   Yerevan has been the scene of massive protests by demonstrators
demanding annexation of the Nagorno-Karabakh region of the
neighboring southern republic of Azerbaijan. The demonstrations had
been peaceful.
   The government daily Izvestia reported Tuesday that thousands of
Armenians went on strike in Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh and that
most flights in and out of the airport had been canceled.
   Perfilyev told reporters that security soldiers were sent to the
airport, but he denied that anyone was killed. He said one man was
hurt in the town of Masis about six miles southwest of Yerevan.
   ``He was taken to the hospital on the same day and died there.
But this man had nothing to do with the events at the airport,''
Perfilyev said. ``The rumors that an Armenian was killed are
groundless.''
   Nahabidyan said demonstrators went to the airport to try to stop
military planes from bringing in paratroopers, tanks and machine
guns. ``The army has occupied all of Armenia. Nagorno-Karabakh,
too,'' he said.
   Perfilyev said more than 400 people gathered inside the terminal
at Zvartnots Airport, and another 1,500 surrounded it.
   ``They impeded the sale of tickets and the collection by
passengers of their luggage, ventured out onto the landing strips,
prevented passengers from entering the terminal and paralyzed the
work of the dispatcher services,'' Tass said.
   Internal security soldiers using loudspeakers finally got the
protesters out of the terminal, it said. ``They were forced out,
but there were no clashes or fights,'' Perfilyev said.
   An editor at the Armenpress Armenian news agency, reached by
telephone in Yerevan, was asked if there were many soldiers in
Yerevan. ``I didn't see any soldiers,'' she said. The telephone
call was interrupted before she could be asked her name or further
information.
   The reports indicated the protesters in Armenia were angered at
how their leaders represented their demands to last week's national
Communist Party conference in Moscow.
   Most Armenians want Nagorno-Karabakh united to neighboring
Armenia. The mountain enclave's predominantly Armenian population
has been agitating for the annexation since February.
   Armenia supports the demand. Azerbaijan opposes it.
   In February, at least 32 people were killed in riots over
annexation which broke out in Sumgait, Azerbaijan.
   Mikhail Padalovich, an editor of the Communist Party newspaper
Kommunist in Yerevan, said he had no information about an airport
incident. He said there were no demonstrations in the city and
workers were at their jobs.
   The Armenian republic's office in Moscow declined comment on the
reports.
   Izvestia said activists met Sunday in Yerevan with delegates to
the Communist Party conference, which ended Friday in Moscow.
Apparently dissatisfied with the Armenian delegation's presentation
of the dispute, they called a strike.
   Solving ethnic disputes and increasing the economic autonomy of
the nation's republics are two key issues in Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
program to restructure the Soviet state and economy.
   The party conference called for greater attention to republics'
calls for economic autonomy, but it said authorities would not
tolerate efforts to incite ethnic tensions.

<HEAD>Gabe Dell, One of Original ``Dead End Kids,'' Dies at 68</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gabe Dell, who parlayed his youthful success
as one of the original ``Dead End Kids'' into a career spanning
more than 50 years as a writer, director, teacher and stage and
film actor, has died. He was 68.
   The Brooklyn, N.Y.-born Dell, whose real name was Gabriel del
Vecchio, died at his North Hollywood home Sunday of leukemia.
   ``That leaves two of us,'' said Dr. Bernard Punsley, a Torrance
physician who is one of the two surviving ``Dead End Kids.'' The
other is actor Huntz Hall, who was in mourning and declined to take
calls Tuesday.
   Dell, Punsley, Hall and the other Dead End Kids shot to fame on
Broadway in 1935 in ``Dead End,'' Sidney Kingsley's examination of
slum life and its connection to crime.
   Following the play's success, the young actors were brought to
Hollywood to star opposite Humphrey Bogart in the movie version.
   Like the rowdy characters they portrayed on stage and screen,
the actors pulled pranks on the porters and played ball in the
aisles during their train trip to Hollywood.
   Meanwhile, their movie went on to garner four Academy Award
nominations, and the young actors went on to make a number of major
films and low-budget productions under the names the Bowery Boys
and Eastside Kids. Among them were ``Angels With Dirty Faces'' and
``Crime School.''
   Some of the other Dead End Kids, such as Leo Gorcey, Billy Halop
and Bobby Jordan, were unable to shed their bad-boy screen images
in later years.
   Dell, however, went on to star as an adult in such Broadway
plays as ``Luv'' and ``The Goodbye People'' as well as work as a
character actor in such films as ``Earthquake'' and ``Who Is Harry
Kellerman ....''
   A student of Zen, he once said: ``I love the freedom that acting
gives me. I don't care if a show I'm in is a hit or not.''
   Surviving are two sons, Gabriel Jr. and Michael, both actors,
and a sister, Ethel Dell. Funeral services will be private.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz
arrived in Thailand today to begin a nine-nation Asian tour and to
deal with issues ranging from the Olympics in Seoul to the future
of Cambodia.
   He also will likely face questions on Sunday's downing of an
Iranian airliner by U.S. naval forces in the Persian Gulf.
   A senior Thai military officer said security precautions were
being increased because of the gulf tragedy. The officer, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, said sharpshooters were included in a
security task force that included police, air force and army
personnel.
   Shultz's two-week journey is to be his last and longest to Asia
as secretary of state. After Thailand, he goes to Malaysia,
Indonesia, the Philippines, Hong Kong, China, South Korea, Japan
and the new Marshall Islands Republic in the Pacific.
   In Bangkok, he planned to meet Thursday with ministers of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations and representatives from
Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Australia and the European
Community.
   The future of Cambodia, where Vietnamese forces have begun
withdrawing after invading the country nearly a decade ago, is
expected to be a major topic of discussion.
   Shultz is expected to stress that the United States would find a
return to power of the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge totally
unacceptable. The communist Khmer Rouge are the most powerful group
within a coalition fighting the Vietnamese, who have pledged to
withdraw from Cambodia by 1990.
   U.S. policy calls for total withdrawal of Vietnamese forces;
support for the coalition led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk; and
seeking of a political solution to the Cambodian conflict.
   The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, who held their
annual conference here this week, said they would ask the United
States and other countries to increase their intake of Indochinese
refugees from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.
   Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Hong Kong have recently
toughened their policies on providing Vietnamese ``boat people''
with temporary asylum, moves that Washington has criticized.
   U.S. trade deficits with newly prosperous Asian nations, U.S.
government subsidies to American farmers and an extensive aid
package for the economically troubled Philippines also will be
discussed.
   Shultz is likely to meet a sympathetic official audience when
explaining the downing of the Iranian jet carrying 290 people, all
of whom are believed to have died.
   But the Malaysian Foreign Ministry on Tuesday deplored the
incident, saying it was difficult to accept U.S. claims that its
forces mistook the large civilian aircraft for a military jet.
   Talks in Beijing may focus on American concern about a reported
flow of Chinese missiles to the Middle East, according to sources
in Washington.
   Shultz expects to deliver a major speech in Seoul on July 18 on
expanding democracy and human rights in South Korea. There will
also be discussions on the running of a trouble-free summer Olympic
Games which begin in the South Korean capital Sept. 17.
   The presence of U.S. air bases in the Philippines will probably
be debated in Manila.
   Trade issues and Japan's emerging role as both a political and
economic force in Asia are likely to feature in discussions in
Tokyo, Shultz's last stop on the Asian continent.

<HEAD>Aquino Says She Will Not Stop Marcos' Return For Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino said today
she will let Ferdinand Marcos return to the Philippines so he can
stand trial on charges of stealing billions of dollars during his
20-year rule.
   Mrs. Aquino made the remark shortly before today's Cabinet
meeting.
   When asked by reporters if she would allow Marcos, her ousted
predecessor, to return to defend himself, she replied, ``Yes, of
course.''
   ``As I have said, if due process will be observed, then
naturally the decision of the court will be respected,'' she added.
   Officials of the Presidential Commission on Good Government have
said they expect to file criminal charges against Marcos by
January. The task of the commission is to recover up to $10 billion
that Marcos and his family allegedly stole from the government or
acquired in other illegal ways during his rule.
   Commission chairman Ramon Diaz told reporters today he was
waiting for Swiss authorities to release information on Marcos'
Swiss bank accounts, which are to be used as evidence against the
deposed president. Swiss officials have said they can release the
information only after prosecution begins.
   The Philippines does not allow trial in absentia, so Marcos
would have to be allowed into the country to stand trial. Since
February 1986, he has lived in exile in Hawaii.
   ``After we receive the evidence from Swiss banks, then we will
file the case,'' Diaz said. ``When the criminal case is filed,
(Mrs. Aquino) is not going to put any obstacle to call in Marcos
home to Manila because he has to face the courts.''
   Mrs. Aquino has so far refused to allow the former president to
return for security reasons. She came to power after Marcos was
ousted during a civilian-military revolt in February 1986.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two musicians from the East German state opera
orchestra have left Japan for asylum in West Germany, a Japanese
Foreign Ministry official said today.
   Gunther Clajus, 57, a viola player, and violinist Rainer Doll,
23, left Tuesday night aboard a Lufthansa flight bound for
Frankfurt, the official said. Both are members of East Germany's
Staatskapelle Berlin.
   Earlier Tuesday, Clajus and Doll called on the West German
Embassy in Tokyo to request asylum and were granted it. Embassy
officials notified the Japanese government.
   The ministry official said both men told Japanese officials they
did not want to return to East Germany. He said there were no
``political motives'' behind the defection, but he refused to
provide further details.
   Local news reports said that prior to Tuesday's defection, a
total of five East German musicians over the past five years have
decided to defect to West Germany while touring Japan. The most
recent case involved a guitarist with an East German circus troupe
in September 1985.
   The 112-member Staatskapelle Berlin toured Japan from June 10 to
July 5.
   The remaining members of the orchestra left for East Germany on
Tuesday afternoon on a chartered flight, according to East German
Embassy officials in Tokyo.

<HEAD>Local Terrorist Group Claims Two Bomb Attacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bombs went off today in two government
offices, and a leftist terrorist group claimed it exploded them to
protest air pollution in the capital.
   No one was injured in the blasts, which occurred shortly after
midnight in offices of the Industry Ministry and the Environment
Ministry. Both were empty at the time, a police spokesman said.
   The Revolutionary Popular Struggle, known as ELA, made the claim
in statements sent to two leftist Athens newspapers, Ethnos and
Elefthertypia.
   The statement said the targeted ministries are responsible for
the persistent smog cloud over the city.
   A heat wave this week, combined with high smog levels, has sent
hundreds of people to hospitals complaining of heart and breathing
problems.
   One of the bombs demolished an office at the Environment
Ministry's center for pollution control. The other shattered
windows and destroyed furniture at an Industry Ministry branch
office in the Tavros district west of Athens.
   ELA has claimed responsibility for several hundred bomb blasts
around the country since 1975. Its most recent attack was an

   Seven people, five of them children,
were killed and seven wounded when three artillery shells fired
from inside Cambodia landed in their village today, an army officer
said.
   It was not known who fired the shells into Sai Tho Kao village
of Buriram province near the Cambodian border. Fighting inside
Cambodia between the Vietnamese-backed government and a coalition
of guerrillas frequently spills into Thailand.
   The officer said Thai intelligence had recently received reports
of fighting between Vietnamese troops and Khmer Rouge guerrillas
near the village.
   The officer said Thai gunners fired warning shots into Cambodia
after the shells landed in the village. He spoke on condition he
not be identified.
   Vietnam says it is withdrawing about 50,000 of its troops from
Cambodia, which it invaded in 1978 to rout the Khmer Rouge from
power. The Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge now makes up part of the
guerrilla coalition headed by Prince Norondom Sihanouk.
   U.S. intelligence reports say Vietnam has already handed over
much of the military operations along the Thai-Cambodian border to
government troops.

<TEXT>
   Muhammad Ali says he's more concerned
about character than politics and that's why he can support both
conservative Sen. Orrin Hatch and liberal Sen. Edward Kennedy.
   ``I don't judge people by their political label, just like I
don't like people to judge me,'' the three-time world heavyweight
boxing champion said. ``I have friends who are Republicans, friends
who are Democrats.''
   Ali, who will campaign for Hatch in Utah this fall, said he
doesn't always agree with Hatch's conservatism, but, ``I respect
the fact that he does what he believes in, and fights on for what
he believes in.''
   ``I think (Hatch) is a remarkable man,'' Ali said Tuesday in a
telephone interview from Charlottsville, Va. ``Man, he's one of the
most effective leaders in the U.S. Senate. Any time he wants me to
be there, I'll be there.''
   Ali said the Republican Hatch and Kennedy, D-Mass., so often at
odds in Senate debate, have in common their struggle to overcome
their environments.
   ``Orrin Hatch was very poor. He grew up on the wrong side of the
tracks,'' he said. ``Ted Kennedy was a rich boy, didn't have to do
anything ... (but) instead he dedicated himself to public life,
even though he knew it could cost him his own life, like it did
with his two brothers.''
   Hatch campaign manager Bud Scruggs said the chance to have ``The
Greatest'' campaign for his boss was too good to pass up.
   Scruggs said Ali began to admire Hatch last year when he watched
televised congressional hearings on the Iran-Contra scandal, in
which the senator repeatedly leaped to the defense of Marine Lt.
Col. Oliver North, and during the Senate hearings on the
unsuccessful nomination of Robert Bork to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Hatch later helped push through the appointment of one of Ali's
friends, Steven Saltzburg, to a Justice Department post.

   Communist Party chief Karoly Grosz has
called for more openness in Hungary's media coverage of government
and party work and announced that the next meeting of the party
leadership will be broadcast live.
   In an article today in the Communist daily Nepszabadsag, Grosz
said he was ``deeply impressed'' with the openness of the Soviet
press.
   Grosz returned Tuesday from a one-day visit to Moscow where he
held talks with Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   According to Nepszabadsag, Grosz said ``the Hungarian media can
report on anything but military secrets.''
   He told the newspaper that a meeting of the party Central
Committee scheduled for July 13 would receive extensive coverage.
The official news agency MTI reported from Moscow on Tuesday that
Grosz had announced at a news conference there that the meeting
would be broadcast live on Hungarian television and radio.
   The proceedings of the party have traditionally been conducted
behind closed doors and the results of such meetings announced in
minimal communiques issued at the end of the sessions.
   Last week, the parliament discussed personnel issues for the
first time in an open session that was marked by unusually fervent
debate.

   In an attempt to lure participants in the
Democratic National Convention to cities in the state outside
Atlanta, the Georgia Tourist Division is making sure that each
delegate is greeted with a can of state-grown popcorn with the
words ``Georgia's Popping.''
   In addition, several cities including Marietta, Warm Springs,
Gainesville and Roswell are offering tours from the convention area
to their communities hile others will host delegation parties the
Sunday before the convention begins.
   The idea is to let other cities share the spotlight _ and a
share of the dollars to be spent by the more than 5,400 delegates,
15,000 members of the press and and others attending the July 18-21
convention.
   ``If we could get three or four press people, we will have done
what we wanted to accomplish,'' said Janice Marshall, executive
director of the Macon Convention and Visitors Bureau.

   Democratic party officials are betting that
local television stations will want more than the two hours a night
coverage of their convention activities planned to be broadcast by
the major networks. They have set up the Convention Satellite News
Service, which will transmit 46 hours of programming during
convention week.
   The transmissions will begin July 16, two days before the
Democrats open their parley in Atlanta's Omni arena and manager
Paul Byers said the material will be available to any television
station with a satellite dish. During the four-day convention the
service will beam live and taped material from 2 p.m. to midnight.
   Byers said four mobile crews will be operating in Atlanta to
provide local stations with packaged interviews with party
officials, live coverage of convention proceedings, both on and off
the floor, and to give them opportunities to interview area
politicians attending the convention.

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis has
gotten the endorsement of the 3,000 delegates of the American
Federation of Teachers, but it is Jesse Jackson who was able to
bring the convention crowd to its feet.
   Both presidential candidates addressed the convention via
satellite as the four-day gathering was ending on Tuesday.
   ``If we are going to take on our foreign competitors, we have to
make teaching an honored and valued profession again,'' said
Dukakis, who spoke from Boston.
   Dukakis, the likely Democratic nominee, called for an
educational venture capital fund to improve teachers' pay and
training. He said the cost would be a fraction of the budget for
the Reagan administration's Strategic Defense Initiative.
   ``If the schools give homework, the parents must have the child
home to do the homework. We must pay for better educational
services ... by doubling the pay of teachers, as our most
fundamental investment in the future of America,'' said Jackson.
   Jackson also praised teachers and said it was the ``love
triangle'' between his mother, his teacher and his principal that
helped him succeed.

   Five Palestinians were convicted today
and sentenced to hang for the bloody 1986 hijacking of a New
York-bound Pan Am jumbo jet in which 21 people were killed.
   The trial before a special one-judge tribunal began in September
and was held in a makeshift courtroom in a prison in this town 30
miles west of Islamabad.
   The plane, which took off from Bombay, India, was seized on the
ground Sept. 5, 1986, in Pakistan's southern port of Karachi. It
sat on the tarmac for 17 hours before Pakistani troops stormed it.
   In addition to those killed, nearly 200 of the 400 passengers
were wounded.
   ``We don't care about the sentence,'' said Mohammad Hafiz
al-Turk, the suspected mastermind. ``We care only about the
millions of Arabs and Islamic countries.''
   Al-Turk, a Libyan arrested in Islamabad less than a week after
the hijacking, was convicted of conspiracy. He was the only one of
the five not to board the Pan Am jet.
   The other four _ Mohammad Ahmed al Munawar, Khalil Hussain
Rahayyal and Saeed Abdul Rahim, all of Lebanon, and Abdul Latif
Sairfani, of Syria _ were convicted of hijacking and murder.
   They were sentenced to hang for their roles in the hijacking and
to 10 consecutive life sentences for the deaths of 10 people. Three
of the four received an additional life sentence in the killing of
an 11th person.
   The four also were each fined the equivalent of $2,777 for each
conviction. Half the money is to go to the families of the
hijackers' victims.
   All five plan to appeal their sentences and have 30 days to do
so. No date was set for the hangings.
   In an interview after the sentencing, al-Turk, the
self-appointed spokesman for the group, said if free he and his
comrades ``would hijack another plane.''
   In a statement issued in January, the five said their aim ``was
to fly the plane towards some sensitive, strategic center of the
Zionist enemy and to blow it up there, with us inside.''
   Witnesses told the court that four gunmen dressed as airport
security guards drove a small van to the Pan Am jet.
   They said the four charged the plane and demanded it fly to
Cyprus to pick up Palestinian comrades. Early in the hijacking, the
three-man cockpit crew escaped through an emergency hatch.
   After shooting an Indian-American passenger, the tension reached
a climax around 9:30 p.m., when an onboard generator ran out of
fuel, plunging the cabin into darkness.
   Fearing an attack, the gunmen began spraying the inside with
bullets as Pakistani security forces stormed the plane.
   Throughout their trial, the five blamed the Pakistani commandos
for the killings.
   Judge Syed Zafar Babar discounted that argument but found the
defendants guilty of just 11 deaths, saying there was insufficient
evidence to convict them of more.
   Pan Am was targeted because of its American origins.

<TEXT>
   Police are advising consumers in a suburban
community to check orange juice containers after a second syringe
and note were found attached to a carton in a supermarket.
   A syringe was sticking into a 64-ounce carton of Minute Maid
orange juice when it was found Tuesday by a clerk at an Alpha Beta
supermarket in Woodland Hills, about 25 miles west of downtown,
said police Sgt. Fred Tuggey.
   A note attached to the carton said ``unsafe packaging,'' said
Alpha Beta spokesman Bill Wade. Other Minute Maid cartons were
pulled from the shelves.
   On Monday, a Minute Maid carton with a similar note and needle
was found at a nearby Von's supermarket. Cartons were taken from
the shelves of that store as well. Both cartons were found on
non-refrigerated shelves.
   ``The note threatened contamination,'' said Von's spokeswoman
Mary McAboy. Authorities refused to release its exact wording.
   ``I would just caution anybody who has a package of this Minute
Maid orange juice to check it carefully for small needle holes and
return it to the store,'' said police Detective Joel Price.
   No injuries were reported in either incident.
   Ms. McAboy said the juice carton found Monday was taken to a
laboratory, where tests concluded it had not been contaminated.
Police were testing both cartons, but results were not immediately
available.
   Police also said they were working with officials from both
stores and with Coca-Cola Co., the maker of Minute Maid products.
   ``They are similar incidents: same brand of orange juice, same
size container,'' said Lt. Lee Lorenze. ``The notes are similar.
Right now, we have no idea ... who did it.''
   Officials for both supermarket chains and Coca-Cola said there
were no indications that any other products in the stores were
tampered with.
   ``We believe they are both isolated incidents,'' said Coca Cola
spokeswoman Michelle Beale. ``We do not think there is anything
wrong with the orange juice. It is just unfortunate that someone
would do this.''

<TEXT>
   Yasser Arafat's Palestinian guerrillas
held talks with Arab mediators today about abandoning their last
Beirut stronghold, the Bourj el-Barajneh refugee camp, to end a
bloody power struggle with a Syrian-backed militia, police said.
   Col. Saeed Mousa's Fatah-Uprising faction stopped shelling the
camp while Arafat's Fatah fighters negotiated with Algerian
officials, Syrian Army officers and leaders of leftist Lebanese
militias, police said.
   Scattered clashes were reported on the edges of the camp.
   At least 158 people have been killed and 618 wounded since
fighting broke out May 1 for control of Bourj el-Barajneh and the
nearby Chatilla camp.
   The struggle involves two Palestinian militias _ Arafat's Fatah
and Mousa's dissidents, who in 1983 broke away from Arafat.
   A police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
mediators were ``working on a plan'' to evacuate from the camp the
last group of Arafat's guerrillas, estimated at 100.
   The loss of Chatilla and the likely evacuation of Bourj
el-Barajneh are a serious setback for Arafat, who has been trying
to rebuild his power base in Lebanon since he was forced out of
Beirut in Israel's 1982 invasion.
   A Fatah official in Bourj el-Barajneh, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the Fatah guerrillas have ``accepted the evacuation
idea in principle but are demanding guarantees that they will not
be attacked when then leave the camp.''
   He said about 150 Fatah fighters have already left the camp
peacefully since the latest bout of fighting erupted Monday.
   A Fatah-Uprising spokesman, Abu-Fadi Hammad, said Arafat's men
``will only be allowed to evacuate after they hand over their
weapons.''
   The Fatah spokesman said the guerrillas still in Bourj
el-Barajneh will probably be taken to Palestine Liberation
Organization bases near the port city of Sidon, about 25 miles
south of Beirut.
   Mousa's fighters, based in the Syrian-controlled mountains
overlooking Beirut, heavily outgunned Arafat's men when they
overran Chatilla June 27, using artillery, rockets and heavy
mortars.
   Arafat's men dislodged Mousa's fighters from the camps soon
after the power struggle flared in May. But the Syrian-backed
Fatah-Uprising faction regrouped and counter-attacked in ferocious
bombardments of the camps from positions in the mountains. Though
Arafat's men were able to repulse more than 20 assaults by Mousa's
guerrillas, they have steadily lost ground.
   Fatah officials said 80 percent of Bourj el-Barajneh has been
wrecked in the last two months. Only an estimated 3,000 of the
camp's 20,000 residents remain.
   The fighting between the Palestinian factions was preceded by
nearly six years of attacks by Israelis, Lebanese Christian
militias and Syrian-backed Shiite Moslems, in which thousands of
people were killed or wounded.
   Mousa broke away from Arafat's PLO in a Syrian-backed mutiny in
May 1983 and set up headquarters in the Syrian capital of Damascus.
   The latest fighting flared after the PLO chairman visited
Damascus in April to try to end his five-year feud with Syrian
President Hafez Assad over who would control the Palestinian
movement.
   Arafat has accused the Syrian government of fomenting the battle
in Beirut to assert its control on the Moslem sector of the city.

   A judge has reserved decision on the
government's latest request in its campaign to reform the Teamsters.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Randy Mastro on Tuesday sought a
preliminary injunction to ``protect the membership from their own
leadership.''
   The government wants liaison officers appointed and empowered to
``discipline Teamsters corruption'' and appoint trustees for
corrupt locals.
   But Teamsters attorney John R. Climaco asked U.S. District Judge
David Edelstein to give the union more time to counter ``what we
consider the false and shameful allegations by the government.''
   Edelstein did not indicate when he would rule on the government
request.
   Last week the government, claiming the Teamsters were dominated
by the Mafia, filed a civil racketeering lawsuit seeking to place
the 1.6 million-member union under a court-appointed trustee who
would oversee `free and fair'' elections.
   The lawsuit also sought to oust any member of the union's
18-member executive board found to have committed or aided the
commission of racketeering activities.

<TEXT>
   The Pentagon says the Iranian airliner shot
down by a Navy ship in the Persian Gulf was broadcasting on a
military channel, although officials privately acknowledge the jet
was in commercial airspace at the time of the incident.
   The Reagan administration said Tuesday that Capt. Will C. Rogers
III of the cruiser USS Vincennes thought his ship was under attack
in part because of conflicting identification signals sent from the
Iran Air A-300 Airbus.
   Pentagon spokesman Daniel Howard said some of the signals were
on a military frequency identified with F-14 fighter jets.
   But while the administration was defending the decision to fire
on the airliner, sentiment grew for U.S. reparations to relatives
of the disaster's victims and officials were being buffeted by
calls for a speedy gesture of conciliation on the world stage.
   On the record, administration officials said there had been no
discussion of awarding reparations. But sources who spoke only on
condition of anonymity said the idea was under active consideration
at the State Department, the Pentagon and the White House.
   Reagan did not rule out reparations, saying it ``is a matter
that has to be discussed'' once a U.S. investigative team
dispatched to the gulf completes its work.
   But Airbus spokesman David Velupillai said from the southern
French town of Toulouse that the jet involved in the incident was
delivered to Iran Air six years ago with two transponders aboard
that should have responded to identification requests from the
Vincennes.
   Iranian airliner pilots, however, denied that Flight 655 would
have been sending on a military channel.
   In London on Tuesday, Capt. Massoud Razavi, a senior Iran Air
pilot, denied U.S. claims that the downed A-300 was transmitting on
two transponders, including a frequency used previously for
military information.
   He told a news conference at the Iranian Embassy: ``The
transponder we are using is the standard transponder and we use
`mode A' which is the civilian code. The code is given by Dubai
(where the jet was headed) and it is preset into the transponder
before takeoff.''
   Capt. Mehroujan Gharib, an Iran Air Boeing 747 supervisory pilot
and safety officer, replied ``No'' at the same conference when
asked if Iran Air civilian planes sometimes used a military
frequency.
   Iran has accused the United States of intentionally shooting
down the wide-bodied jet which was flying over the Persian Gulf
with 290 people aboard. President Reagan and other U.S. officials
have described it as a tragic accident.
   One congressional source said administration officials are
recommending that Reagan quickly make an offer of compensation on a
humanitarian basis, in part to differentiate the United States from
the Soviet Union, which rebuffed all requests for reparations
following its 1983 destruction of a Korean Air Lines jetliner with
269 people aboard.
   Some U.S. officials, however, noted that the Iranian government
has used the incident as an anti-American rallying point and said
it might be reluctant to cooperate with any U.S. humanitarian
effort.
   Iran's military commander-in-chief, Parliament Speaker Hashemi
Rafsanjani, continued the drumbeat of hostile rhetoric Tuesday,
declaring on Tehran Radio: ``We cannot allow ourselves to refrain
from taking revenge. The choice of timing is up to us, and not to
America.''
   In other developments:
   _A man purporting to speak for Islamic Jihad claimed the
pro-Iranian faction would kill one of two American hostages it was
holding in Lebanon, but police in Beirut said the deadline passed
without incident. It was not possible to authenticate the call.
   _Peggy Say, sister of hostage Terry Anderson, said she had been
told that he might be released over the July 4th weekend, but those
hopes were dashed by Sunday's attack in the Persian Gulf. Anderson,
40, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, has
been held the longest of 18 foreign captives in Lebanon.
   _Secretary of State George P. Shultz disclosed Tuesday that
before the airbus was shot down, Iranian officials had sent
messages through third parties indicating a desire to open a direct
dialogue with the United States and that the United States had
responded positively, the New York Times reported in today's
editions.
   ``We've had a number of these probes ... from Iran through
various third parties saying that they'd like to talk with us, and
we've responded to those,'' Shultz said as he began a 2{-week trip
to nine Pacific and East Asian nations. ``Since there have been
several, we have said we're ready for one, and we're prepared for
an authoritative discussion.''
   Howard, the Pentagon's top spokesman, said the Iranian aircraft
was broadcasting ``in two modes'' and that one of those had been
``previously identified or associated with an F-14'' jet fighter,
the most potent attack plane in Iran's arsenal.
   But other information that surfaced Tuesday cast doubt on
initial Pentagon reports that the plane was outside commercial
airspace and was descending toward the Vincennes, as an attacking
warplane would do.
   House Armed Services Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., said military
officials told his panel during a closed-door briefing that the
airliner never left a commercial air corridor. Officials also
disclosed that another American ship in the area concluded the
Iranian A-300 airbus maintained a steady altitude of 12,600 feet,
rather than descending toward the Vincennes.
   Senior members of Congress called on Reagan to make a
humanitarian gesture by offering compensation to families that lost
relatives aboard the jetliner.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said that if reparations
``would assuage the grief of the other aggrieved party, surely we
could do that. Congress would support that if it were requested.''
   ``I think it would be a wise idea,'' said Sen. John Warner,
R-Va., the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee.
``There's a clear admission by our president that this was an
unfortunate accident,'' and Congress likely would provide the money
for such payments, he said.
   Apparently the most relevant law is one that provides for
compensation in ``combat-related'' situations. It empowers the
Pentagon to settle claims for such losses. The Iranian jetliner was
shot down over waters patrolled by U.S. warships protecting tankers
carrying oil to Europe and Japan.
   While the commanders have orders to fire if attacked _ and have
done so __ the United States is not at war with Iran.
   Amid the swirl of questions about how the administration will
make amends for the air disaster, officials disclosed that Reagan
had sent a carefully worded diplomatic message to Iran's leaders,
urging an end to the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war.
   Reagan's message, sent Sunday through Swiss intermediaries,
expressed ``deep regret'' about the incident. ``It was not an
intentional act,'' he said in the message.
   Reagan's message to Tehran came amid an outpouring of dismay and
some outrage from friends and foes around the world.
   Radio Moscow condemned the U.S. attack as ``deliberate mass
murder in cold blood.'' President Mohammad Zia al-Haq of Pakistan,
a U.S. ally, called the incident ``both highly regrettable and
reprehensible.''

<HEAD>Britain Announces Completion of Deal With Iran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain and Iran have completed a deal to exchange
compensation for damage to each other's embassies in violent
incidents about eight years ago, the Foreign Office announced today.
   It insisted the agreement did not mean Britain was paying ``a
price for better relations.''
   Iran is to net nearly $2 million in the deal, which Foreign
Office officials and Mohammed Besti, the Iranian charge d'affaires
in London, completed Tuesday after three weeks of negotiations, a
Foreign Office spokesman said.
   Observers speculated that Iran's willingness to negotiate
signaled a desire to improve its relations with Britain, which were
severely strained last year when a British diplomat was beaten up
in Tehran and London withdrew its staff.
   The spokesman said Britain will pay Iran $3.4 million in
compensation for damaging the Iranian Embassy in London, which
British commandos stormed and gutted in 1980 to free hostages held
by opponents of the Iranian government.
   Iran will pay Britain $1.67 million dollars for damage caused by
crowds to the British Embassy in Tehran following the seizure of
the American Embassy and its staff in 1979, the spokesman said.
   The spokesman, who requested anonymity, denied the compensation
was aimed at freeing British hostages in Lebanon.
   ``You should not look at this agreement in the context of us
trying to pay a price for better relations with the Iranians,'' he
said. ``We have said we want better relations with Iran. It is an
important country.''
   The deal was announced only two days after Iran severely
criticized Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's refusal to condemn
the United States for downing an Iranian airliner over the Persian
Gulf.
   The United States said its forces mistook the civilian jetliner
for an Iranian jet fighter.

   Here is a sampling of editorial page reaction to Edwin Meese
III's announcement Tuesday that he is resigning as U.S. attorney
general.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>The Atlanta Constitution:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Edwin Meese III has wisely decided to declare victory and
retreat. Never mind that the attorney general's pathetic claims of
exoneration ring hollow. His promise to leave office within a month
will allow the administration to begin the tedious task of
rebuilding a Justice Department laid low by the faulty judgment of
its boss.
   Exoneration? The special prosecutor simply indicated he will not
seek to indict the attorney general. This should not be confused
with a vote of confidence. ...
   The truth is, he has been presiding for some time over a Justice
Department that was steadily losing respected attorneys. The
reasons for this integrity drain had little to do with the `barrage
of misleading and false allegations' cited by Meese at his press
conference. Rather, the exodus was caused by the real _ very real _
ethical questions regarding the attorney general's conduct.
   In short, Meese undermined the system. The sooner he goes, the
sooner it may recover.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>The (Baltimore) Sun:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III's resignation will bring to an
end one of the saddest periods in the history of the Department of
Justice. ...
   The department has been in a state of drift, conflict within and
without and the appearance of _ and perhaps the fact of _
impropriety at the top. All this centered on Mr. Meese's
activities. We have to say it is good to see him go at last.
   ``That report `fully vindicates me,' the attorney general said.
We'll see. The report is still secret. It is reported to be
critical of Mr. Meese's ethical standards. All the public knows is
that the independent counsel decided not to seek an indictment of
the attorney general. What a standard for ``vindication'': not
indicted!
</TEXT>
<HEAD>(Minneapolis) Star Tribune:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   In his own time and on his own terms, Attorney General Edwin
Meese finally has heeded the chorus calling for his resignation. .
..
   Meese's announcement came just hours after the filing of special
prosecutor James McKay's report on the attorney general's conduct,
which apparently found insufficient basis for prosecution. In
Meese's eyes, that finding cleared the way for resignation with
full honor: The absence of an indictment, Meese said, ``fully
vindicates me''; the question the report raised about his ethical
behavior amount to ``mere commentary and opinon.'' ...
   That list of unlawyerly high jinks apparently was not enough to
spur an indictment. Yet surely it is enough to prompt an attorney
general to step down. Americans needed no guidance from a special
prosecutor to conclude that Meese was unscrupulous and imprudent.
Many have known from the start what Meese will not admit even now:
To deserve the job, an attorney general must not only skirt
criminality; he must avoid dishonor.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>The New York Times:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   What's right about this is that the Justice Department will no
longer be headed by someone distracted by so many embarrassing
ethical and political questions. ...
   His performance was badly flawed. He bungled the Iran-Contra
investigation, giving Oliver North the time he needed to shred
documents. He let his friend Robert Wallach manipulate the
machinery of government for a Middle East pipeline project, a legal
and political abuse whatever the independent counsel concludes
about its criminality. ...
   A crook he was not, but that is not the only basis for holding
high office. He did not earn the President's bouquet yesterday that
he was ``a darn good attorney general.'' His friend Ronald Reagan
gave more faithful loyalty down than Ed Meese gave lawyerly loyalty
up.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>The Dallas Morning News:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   In announcing Tuesday that he will step down as U.S. attorney
general in late July or early August, Edwin Meese was able to
satisfy his personal goal of leaving the Reagan administration with
what he considers a ``clear name.''
   Politically, his departure enables Vice President George Bush to
go forward with his presidential campaign with less of the
so-called ``sleaze factor'' created by the Meese controversy. And
it takes Mr. Meese out of the limelight before the Republican
National Convention.
   It was a relief for the administration that no criminal charges
were brought against Mr. Meese as a result of the investigation
that ended Tuesday. ...
   There is a lesson here for the next president, whether it be
George Bush or Michael Dukakis. Mr. Meese has been described by the
president as a loyal and ``good friend.'' The nation's top lawyer
should not be selected on the basis of friendship or because the
person was a valued campaign adviser but because that person is
highly respected in the legal field.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>The Cincinnati Enquirer:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Details of the independent counsel's report have not been made
public. Indications, however, are that the investigation unearthed
no grounds for a criminal indictment. In that sense, Mr. Meese was
able to accompany his resignation wath a claim of vindication.
   The main question, though, was not whether the attorney general
had committed crimes in office. It was rather whether he had set
appropriate standards of ethical conduct for other federal
officails to emultate.
   Most Americans are willing to excuse one or two misjudgments on
the part of their high public officials. But Attorney General Meese
had arrived at the point where answering allegations claimed too
much of his time and his attention. The burden had become too
weighty.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>The Washington Post:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   He leaves office having been mightily investigated and not
indicted. Is that the measure of a successful attorney general, a
man who has served his country and his president with distinction?
Hardly. It is the minimum. ...
   While not rising to the level of rule-breaking or actual crime,
Mr. Meese's repeated intervention on behalf of friends, his sloppy
personal financial dealings and his apparent lack of understanding
of the need for exemplary, not just lawful, behavior in office have
been continuously troubling. ...
   Surely Mr. Meese and his family will be glad to leave
Washington. They have been the target of a great deal of public
abuse and have suffered more than one private tragedy during their
years here. It is understandable that he is relieved by the
independent counsel's decision, but he has done the right thing by
resigning now.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>The Detroit News:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   By announcing his intention to resign within a few weeks as U.S.
attorney general, Edwin Meese has finally acceded to the wishes of
the enemies of his president _ as well as many of the president's
friends. Politics is a hard calling, and Mr. Meese had become a
political liability to his president and his cause. He picked a
good time to leave. ...
   Mr. Meese observed that since there was no finding of grounds
for criminal action against him, the investigation by special
counsel McKay ``fully vindicated'' him. That is something of an
overstatement. Had Mr. Meese not announced his resignation, the
Justice Department's own Office of Professional Responsibility
would likely have had to conduct yet another debilitating
investigation on the basis of the McKay report. ...
   Yet his continued presence in Washington would have been an
undeniable liability for the Reagan administration in its remaining
months, not to mention the presidential campaign of fellow
Republican George Bush. In the end, Mr. Meese's inability to steer
clear of political hazards cost him his job. It also created a
stain on the administration he so zealously sought to serve.

<HEAD>Small Earthquake Hits Southern California</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UPLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A small earthquake rumbled through a wide
area of Southern California today, but there were no reports of
injury or significant damage, officials said.
   The quake, which struck at 3:55 a.m., measured 3.7 on the
Richter scale of ground motion and was centered four miles
northwest of Upland, said Robert Finn, spokesman for the seismology
laboratory at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
   ``It was another aftershock of the June 26th Upland quake which
measured 4.5 on the Richter scale,'' Finn said.
   The quake was felt in Los Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino
counties. Upland is about 35 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.
   Police dispatcher Keri Reever said she received about 15 or 20
calls from residents after today's shaker.
   The quake came a day after a quake measuring 4.5 on the Richter
scale struck the Owens Valley. That quake was centered 10 miles
south of Lone Pine, about 170 miles northeast of Los Angeles.
   Dorothy Shunkwiler, a dispatcher for the Inyo County Sheriff's
Department, said she received no calls of damage or injuries after
that quake, which hit at 11:18 a.m. Tuesday.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause
slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable
damage, 6 severe damage.

   The designated heir to Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini called for attacks on U.S. targets worldwide to avenge the
downing of an Iranian passenger jet carrying 290 people. Commercial
flights were canceled in the area of the attack.
   Before dawn today, Iranian gunboats raided a merchant vessel in
the Strait of Hormuz, gateway to the Persian Gulf, and set the ship
ablaze, shipping executives said.
   The executives identified the ship as the Atlantic Ocean and
said it had a Korean crew. They had no further details.
   U.S. military investigators today reportedly interviewed the
commander and senior officers of the USS Vincennes as an official
inquiry into the shooting of the Airbus 300 began. All 290 people
on board Iran Air Flight 655 were killed.
   Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, Khomeini's heir-apparent, urged
Iran's patriarch in a letter to order terrorist attacks against
U.S. targets worldwide.
   In the letter, Montazeri asked Khomeini, 87, to call on
``revolutionary cells ... to unleash their wrath on American
financial, political and military targets everywhere.''
   Tehran radio reported that President Ali Khamenei sent letters
to heads of state claiming Iran has the ``right to avenge the blood
of innocent children, men and women.''
   Khamenei asked other nations to condemn the United States for
the downing of Flight 655, which he said ``roused a wave of rage in
Iran.''
   In the Persian Gulf, airport sources said commercial flights
were canceled or diverted in several countries because of the
downing of the jet.
   Iran Air stopped its daily flights from the Iranian airport of
Bandar Abbas to Dubai airport, airline sources said. The route is
the same that Flight 655 took when it was hit.
   U.S. officials said the warship shot down the Iranian jetliner
because its officers believed the plane was an Iranian F-14 fighter
jet. A key goal of the inquiry will be to establish why the system
did not distinguish between the wide-bodied airliner and a military
jet.
   Under a 15-day deadline and a tight lid of secrecy, the
six-member team went to work, hours after arriving in the gulf late
Tuesday, military sources said.
   The group, led by Rear Adm. William M. Fogarty, a senior staff
officer at U.S. Central Command headquarters in Tampa, Fla.,
includes a military lawyer and technical experts who will analyze
computer tapes, communications records and other data.
   The Navy refused to give the current location of the 9,600-ton
Vincennes. In New York, the Iranian Mission to the United Nations
said Tuesday that the doomed airliner had signaled that it was a
civilian plane. In Toronto, an Iranian official said the Airbus was
still climbing when it was hit and had not received any U.S.
warnings.
   U.S. officials have said the plane did not signal it was a
civilian airliner, that it was descending as it approached the
Vincennes, following a typical attack pattern, and that seven
warnings were sent to the plane on both military and civilian
channels.
   American sources in the gulf, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that U.S. warships had at least twice been involved
in mix-ups with civilian planes before.
   One officer said that about a month ago, an airliner thought a
U.S. warship was trying to order it to change course when the ship
was talking by radio to a different plane.
   Another U.S. military source said a U.S. frigate, making its
first trip into the gulf through the Strait of Hormuz in mid-June,
briefly locked its weapons radar on an airliner but quickly
realized the mistake.
   ``These crews are always nervous when they come into the gulf
for the first time,'' said the source. ``And one thing they don't
seem to get the word on is how much commercial air traffic there is
out here.''
   Iran accuses the United States of supporting Iraq in the Persian
Gulf war, which began in September 1980. The United States'
official position is that it is neutral and its forces are in the
gulf to protect neutral shipping, which Iran has been attacking.

   Two American Indians headed in different
directions as they left jail five months after they were arrested
for taking as many as 20 people hostage in a newspaper office.
   Eddie Hatcher, 30, and Timothy Jacobs, 19, were freed under
$100,000 unsecured bonds Tuesday and ordered not to set foot in
Robeson County while awaiting trial, scheduled to start Monday.
   ``I've seen murderers and rapists let out on bond right away,
but they put us through hell for the last five months,'' Jacobs,
19, said as he left the courthouse.
   ``I'm glad to be out,'' Hatcher said. ``It feels good.''
   U.S. Magistrate Charles McCotter indicated he was reluctant to
free the men, who are accused of taking hostages Feb. 1 at The
Robesonian newspaper in Lumberton.
   But he said a ruling by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
last week, which held that Hatcher and Jacobs had been denied a
timely detention hearing after their arrest, gave him no choice.
   Under the conditions McCotter set, Hatcher and Jacobs are to
stay out of Robeson County, avoid all contact with government
witnesses, report daily by telephone to probation officers and
return to the residences of court-approved ``custodians'' by 9 p.m.
daily.
   Hatcher will stay with an uncle in Winston-Salem while awaiting
trial.
   Jacobs will live in Halifax County with a family friend.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John S. Bruce had asked McCotter to keep
the two in jail, but if that was not possible, to put them under
virtual house arrest. Bruce argued that the appeals court ruling
had only ordered a new hearing, and that the judges had not
considered evidence relating to the seriousness of the crime.
   Hatcher and Jacobs said they took over the newspaper office to
bring attention to drug trafficking and racial injustices in
Robeson County law enforcement.

   Michael Dukakis interviewed Rep. Lee Hamilton of
Indiana today, rounding out two days of interviews of prospective
running mates, including two former rivals in the Democratic
presidential race _ Sen. Albert Gore and Rep. Richard Gephardt.
   Hamilton said he would accept a vice presidential nomination, as
did Gephardt. Gore declined comment.
   Hamilton met with Dukakis for about 50 minutes this morning at
the Massachusetts governor's Statehouse office. That session
brought to seven the number of potential running mates interviewed
by the nominee-to-be in the past week.
   Two of them _ Gore and Gephardt _ visited Dukakis on Tuesday.
Jesse Jackson, who technically remains in the race although Dukakis
has a mathematical lock on the nomination, spent the Fourth of July
with Dukakis.
   The Massachusetts governor interviewed Sens. John Glenn of Ohio,
Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and Bob Graham of Florida in Washington last
week.
   After today's meeting, Hamilton said he disccused the vice
presidency with Dukakis and would accept the nomination if it was
offered to him. ``I would accept it, first of all, if he thought I
could be helpful,'' said Hamilton, who has been adivising Dukakis
on foreign policy and economic issues.
   While Dukakis was in Boston stepping up the search, top adviser
Paul Brountas was in Washington on related business, conducting
research on the contenders and seeking input from party leaders.
Brountas was to remain in the nation's capital for several days.
   Meanwhile, Dukakis came under attack today on his home turf.
Republican Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania called a news
conference on the Statehouse steps to criticize a Massachusetts
program that, until it was amended earlier this year, allowed
inmates serving life sentences without chance for parole to be
furloughed. One such inmate raped a Maryland woman after escaping
while on furlough.
   Specter appeared at the request of likely Republican nominee
George Bush, and said he planned a similar event Thursday in
Denver. ``I think it raises a question as to his overall
judgment,'' Specter said of Dukakis' support of the furlough
program.
   The Dukakis campaign had local law enforcement officials,
prosecutors and Sen. John F. Kerry on hand to counter Specter.
Kerry and Specter engaged in a good-natured give and take but Kerry
had harsh words for Bush, saying he has been a failure in leading
the Reagan administration's anti-drug efforts.
   Dukakis was scheduled to meet with several civil rights leaders
this afternoon and was to address the Greek Orthodox Ecumenical
Congress, which is meeting in Boston. The certain Republican
nominee, Vice President George Bush, was to visit Dukakis' home
turf Thursday to address the same group.
   Dukakis also plans to travel to Arizona Friday, during a
three-day campaign swing through the West, to meet privately with
former rival and ex-Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt. The trip will also
include campaigning in Texas with Bentsen.
   Campaign aides said Dukakis would seek Babbitt's advice but that
the former governor was not being considered for the vice
presidential nomination.
   Gore waved to reporters but declined comment when he emerged
from Dukakis' Brookline home after spending an hour with the
governor Tuesday night. The Tennessee senator was critical of
Dukakis at times during the primary season but endorsed him last
month during a Dukakis campaign swing in the South.
   Gephardt, D-Mo., spent an hour with Dukakis earlier Tuesday at
the Statehouse. He declined to discuss specifics of their
conversation but said he would accept the vice presidential
nomination if Dukakis offered it to him.
   Before leaving town on Tuesday, Jackson said he was the most
qualified of the candidates for second billing behind Dukakis, and
called other contenders ``unknown quantities.''
   Jackson left behind top aide Ron Brown, who met with Dukakis
campaign manager Susan Estrich and Democratic National Committee
Chairman Paul Kirk to discuss convention logistics.
   Democratic officials were discussing a tentative convention
framework in which Jackson would deliver a prime time television
speech on Tuesday night, the second night of the party sessions,
sources said.
   The governor has made Attorney General Edwin Meese a frequent
target during his campaign rhetoric and was quick to respond to
word that Meese was resigning.
   ``I think the Meese resignation is long overdue,'' Dukakis told
reporters as he left his office for the day. ``I never thought he
should have been appointed in the first place.''
   Dukakis said the Meese resignation would not affect his
criticism of the ethical standards of the Reagan administration and
he said Bush had to answer for those problems.
   ``The Meese resignation itself is not going to solve this
administration's problems,'' Dukakis said. ``This administration
has had one scandal after another, one resignation after another.''
   Dukakis has tried to carefully juggle his duties as governor
with his candidacy, but a new poll suggested his run for the White
House may have affected his once-overwhelming support at home.
   The poll, conducted by KRC Research of Cambridge for The Boston
Herald and WBZ-TV, found that 55 percent of the 400 likely
Massachusetts general election voters polled gave Dukakis a
favorable rating, compared to 71 percent in January 1987 _ before
he announced his presidential candidacy. The poll, which had a
margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points, said
Dukakis' unfavorability rating has jumped from 17 percent in
January 1987 to 36 percent.
   The survey indicated voters were not happy with the way Dukakis
has handled the state's recent budget problems, but still showed
him leading Bush in Massachusetts 51 percent to 37 percent.

   Several thousand workers from
Yugoslavia's largest rubber and shoe plant today forced their way
inside the Federal Parliament building, but police forced them out
a half hour later, witnesses and the Tanjug news agency said.
   In an action unprecedented in Communist Yugoslavia's postwar
history, about 4,000 demonstrators clashed with security police in
front of the Parliament building. Police were unable to stop the
protestors from entering.
   The workers are demanding a 100 percent pay increase, 30 percent
reduction of the plant's administration, better working conditions
and full rather than partial payment of June wages.
   The workers said their average wages amount to 150,000 dinars,
or $62.50. The average Yugoslav salary is the equivalent of $120.
   The demonstrators filled the halls of the domed classical-style
building, demanding negotiations with top government officials and
chanting slogans calling for changes in the leadership.
   After about half an hour, police and Parliament security
officers forced them to leave. No weapons were used and no injuries
were reported, Tanjug and witnesses said.
   Tanjug said the demonstrators waited outside the building for
the president of Parliament, Dusan Popovski, to come out and
address them.
   The demonstrators demanded the resignation of Nenad Krekic,
Yugoslavia's finance minister. Krekic was the director of their
plant two years ago and the workers hold him responsible for their
situation.
   About 5,000 demonstrators, representing about 10,000 strikers of
the Borovo plant, traveled on foot and by bus from Borovo, a
central Yugoslav town 62 miles west of Belgrade. They began
arriving in the capital during the night and continued coming
during the morning.
   The demonstrators were met at a downtown trade union building by
a government delegation that included Zvonimir Hrabar, state trade
union president; and Spasoje Medenica, vice president of the
Federal Parliament.
   ``They promised us everything except the pay hike which is our
main demand,'' one Borovo worker, Zorica Radic, told The Associated
Press.
   ``We refuse to move from here and will continue the protest
until our demands are met,'' she said.
   More than 10,000 people, mostly Borovo workers, demonstrated
Tuesday in Vukovar, the administrative center of the region about
three miles south of Borovo. They chanted ``Down With the
Government'' and demanded higher wages, witnesses said.
   The demand for pay increases clashes with the government's
austerity measures that link wages to productivity in order to cut
inflation, currently at about 175 percent, and to improve overall
economic performance.
   Yugoslav officials claim there is no alternative to the program,
made in conjunction with the International Monetary Fund, if the
country wants to pay off its $21 billion foreign debt.
   ``How can we survive and do heavy physical work if the prices go
up and the wages are the same level or even go down?'' one of the
workers who arrived in Belgrade said.
   ``We will not continue to work and there will be a lot of
trouble if our wages are not hiked,'' he said.
   Another 2,000 workers of the Vertilen textile factory in
Varazdin, about 30 miles north of Zagreb, also were on strike.
   They marched on the town's streets today chanting ``We Want
Bread and Work,'' and demanded that the factory, temporarily closed
for producing losses, be reopened.
   Yugoslavia registered an all-time record of 1,600 strikes last
year, involving more than 300,000 workers, but most of those work
stoppages were staged inside factory gates.

<TEXT>
   Thick, eye-burning smoke hung over a Lake
Erie marina early today from smoldering Fiberglas after a fire
destroyed an estimated 150 boats and injured a father and son.
   The fire started Tuesday evening after a boat apparently
exploded in an aluminum storage building, said Lorain Safety
Director Richard Yepko. The exact cause of the fire was unknown, he
said, estimating damage at $3 million to $5 million.
   About 100 firefighters from Lorain and five nearby communities
fought the blaze for about two hours before bringing it under
control, said Fire Chief Joseph Pribanic. But the heavy smoke
continued to emanate from the ruins this morning.
   David Dorner, 30, was taken to the Cleveland Metropolitan
General Hospital burn unit where he was in fair condition today
with multiple burns. His father, Ken Dorner, 51, was in fair
condition in a hospital with burns on his arm and face. The two
apparently were in the building working on their boat when the fire
broke out, said Lorain Community Hospital spokeswoman Thelma Price.
   Norm Olsen, a boat owner who had his craft away from the marina
at the time of the fire, said the boats kept at the facility were
18- to 30-foot pleasure crafts, stacked in three-layered tiers.
   One firefighter, who declined to be identified, said the thick
smoke and exploding gas tanks of the boats made the fire one of the
toughest he had fought in 20 years.
   ``It was like igniting cases of dynamite,'' he said.

<NOTE>Eds: Top 9 grafs new with Bush comments on Iran, Hamilton
comments; pick up 7th graf pvs bgng ``The former Dukakis...</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis talked privately today with Indiana
Rep. Lee Hamilton, the latest in the parade of vice presidential
candidates. Vice President George Bush said he would not apologize
to Iran for the U.S. military action that left 290 civilians dead.
   En route to Dallas for a speech to Hispanic leaders, Bush was
asked by reporters if the United States should apologize for
shooting down an Iranian civilian plane. ``No, but we probably
ought to do what we did, which is to officially express regret,
which I guess should happen when you have the loss of innocent
life.''
   But as for an apology, Bush said, ``I wouldn't. Because of the
facts, what happened.''
   Dukakis wrapped up another round in his search for a vice
presidential running mate, meeting in Boston with Hamilton, who
told reporters afterward, ``I would accept it, first of all, if he
thought I could be helpful.'' Hamilton won praise for his handling
of the select Iran-Contra committee and has been advising Dukakis
informally on foreign policy.
   Dukakis' efforts in choosing a vice presidential candidate
occurred against the backdrop of a budget crisis at home in
Massachusetts. The money crunch forced him to agree to new taxes _
an issue that was quickly seized upon by the Republicans.
   Dukakis also came under criticism from President Reagan, who on
Tuesday also gave the vice president his strongest vote of
confidence yet.
   Bush is ``the kind of man I want to follow me,'' Reagan told a
group of conservatives at the Old Executive Office Building. He
said Bush would continue the conservative revolution begun under
Reagan.
   Bush was traveling to his adopted home state of Texas today for
a meeting of the League of United Latin-American Citizens, the
largest Hispanic civil rights organization in the country.
   Dukakis on Tuesday brought in Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee
and Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri for face-to-face talks in
Boston. Gephardt said he'd take the job if it were offered, but
Gore would not comment.
   The former Dukakis rivals treated him harshly during the heat of
the primary campaign but both eventually endorsed the Massachusetts
governor.
   Dukakis is also to travel to Arizona Friday to meet with another
former rival, Bruce Babbitt. Aides said Dukakis was seeking
Babbitt's advice but was not considering him for the vice
presidential nomination.
   Jesse Jackson, who spent the July Fourth holiday with Dukakis,
dismissed contenders other than himself.
   ``The others under consideration are unknown quantities beyond
their districts and beyond their home states,'' Jackson said in
Boston before leaving for New York, where he was holding a series
of editorial board meetings today.
   The private sessions with prospective running mates fueled
speculation that the certain Democratic nominee was moving closer
to naming a second.
   While Dukakis conducted interviews at home, his closest adviser,
Paul Brountas, began a four-day stay in Washington. Campaign aides
said Brountas was conducting research on the vice presidential
contenders and talking with party leaders.
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III's resignation Tuesday was
welcome news to the Bush campaign, which viewed the attorney
general's legal problems as a liability. Although Bush never
publicly criticized Meese or called for his resignation, he issued
a statement saying: ``Ed did the right thing and I wish him well.''
   Dukakis, who has frequently made an issue of ethics problems in
the Reagan administration, called the Meese resignation long
overdue.
   ``This administration's inability to set high standards for
public service will not be solved by the Meese resignation,'' he
said. ``This administration has had one scandal after another, one
resignation after another.''
   Dukakis in turn came under fire from Reagan, who in addressing
the conservatives referred to Dukakis not by name but as ``a
governor.'' It was clear which governor he was talking about,
though.
   ``The American people understand what liberalism means and don't
like it, so our opponents plan to go to the voters incognito _
they're putting on political trenchcoats and sunglasses,'' Reagan
said, referring to the sparse Democratic platform, described by
Republicans as deliberately vague.
   ``How other than liberal would you characterize a governor who
in the last five years increased his state's spending twice as fast
as the federal government's and more than a third faster than the
average for all the other states?'' Reagan asked.
   Dukakis, while trying to find a running mate, also is facing one
of the most serious budget crises of his career as governor of
Massachusetts and met Tuesday with legislators in his Statehouse
office.
   Although fiscal year 1988 expired last Thursday, there is still
no plan in place to close the year-end deficit. Senate Ways and
Means Chairwoman Patricia McGovern confirmed Tuesday that the 1988
budget is at least $450 million in deficit, due to disappointing
tax collections in June.
   There is also no budget in place for the new fiscal year, making
it difficult for the administration to run the government.
   Democratic officials, meanwhile, are discussing a plan under
which Jackson would give a prime time televised speech on the
second night of the party's national convention, as would the other
Democrats who lost out to Dukakis in the fight for the party's
presidential nomination.
   Under the outline, former President Jimmy Carter would speak
during prime time on Monday night, the same evening as a keynote
speech by Texas treasurer Ann Richards and remarks by party
chairman Paul Kirk, according to officials who spoke only on
condition of anonymity.
   Kirk met Tuesday with representatives of Dukakis' and Jackson's
campaigns. But Ron Brown, who is heading Jackson's convention
operation, said ``the decision is that we have no present intention
of dropping any'' of the outstanding platform issues which Jackson
has threatened to carry to the convention floor.

   Eddie Murphy's ``Coming to America'' dethroned
the cartoon comedy ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' during an explosive
July 4th box office weekend.
   Moviegoers spent a record $70 million Friday through Monday,
said John Krier, whose Exhibitor Relations Co. tracks the
box-office take.
   ``Coming to America,'' the tale of an African prince who
journeys to America in search of a bride, hauled in $21.4 million
during the four days and earned $28.4 million since its opening
Wednesday.
   Murphy's prince knocked the critically acclaimed ``Roger
Rabbit'' from the top of the box office after a reign of only one
week.
   However, the Disney comedy that combines animated characters
with real actors still drew $14.5 million in ticket sales for a
total gross of $37.2 million since its release two weeks ago.
   Dick Cook, head of distribution for Buena Vista Pictures,
distributor of the Disney film, noted ``Roger Rabbit'' still had
the highest per-screen average of all current releases and is
running ahead of previous blockbuster movies during comparable
holiday periods, such as ``Three Men and a Baby'' and ``Back to the
Future.''
   Third place went to another comedy, ``Big,'' which grossed $6.5
million on the little-boy antics of Tom Hanks. ``Big'' has earned
$53 million in five weeks.
   The romantic baseball film ``Bull Durham'' batted in $5.3
million to win fourth place and a three-week score of $21.8 million.
   ```Crocodile' Dundee II,'' which stars Paul Hogan as an
Australian adventurer, remained a box office contender, bounding
from sixth place to fifth and taking in $5.3 million to bring its
six-week earnings up to $87.2 million.
   The Dan Akroyd-John Candy comedy ``The Great Outdoors'' finished
sixth with $4.6 million, while the Arnold Schwarzenegger-Jim
Belushi action film ``Red Heat'' muscled in $4.3 million for
seventh place.
   The female buddy comedy ``Big Business,'' starring Bette Midler
and Lily Tomlin as mixed-up twins, placed eighth with $4 million in
ticket sales, while the fantasy adventure ``Willow'' fell a spot to
ninth with $2.5 million in weekend earnings.
   Remaining at No. 10, with $1.8 million, was the military
thriller ``The Presidio'' starring Sean Connery and Mark Harmon.
   Here are the top films for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations Co., with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater

<HEAD>Distribution of Settlement Fund To Begin This Year</HEAD>

   Four years after Vietnam veterans settled a
lawsuit against manufacturers of the herbicide Agent Orange, a
federal judge has set into motion the distribution of $240 million
to be used for disability payments and other assistance.
   U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein of Brooklyn announced
plans Tuesday for handing out the settlement money, which was freed
after the U.S. Supreme Court last week removed the last legal
obstacle in the lengthy Agent Orange litigation.
   Cash payments and other benefits could be available early next
year, according to the distribution agreement.
   The class action, initiated in 1978, was settled in May 1984
when seven chemical companies that manufactured Agent Orange agreed
to pay $180 million. The settlement money has grown to $240 million
through interest during the appeals process.
   The distribution plan has two major components: a $170 million
program to provide cash benefits to long-term, totally disabled
veterans and to the families of veterans whose deaths were believed
to have been linked to Agent Orange; and a $52 million program to
fund social service projects that benefit veterans and their
families.
   In addition, $5 million will be distributed to Vietnam veterans
in Australia and New Zealand. Another $13 million will be used to
pay lawyers' fees and costs for administering the distribution plan.
   Agent Orange was used as a defoliant in Southeast Asia during
the 1960s by the U.S. military.
   The herbicide contains the highly toxic dioxin, and veterans
contend that exposure to it causes cancer and other illnesses.
   The chemical companies have said there is no scientific proof
linking dioxin exposure to human illness and the settlement does
not include an admission of fault by the manufacturers.
   The companies sued were Monsanto, Dow, Uniroyal, Hercules, T.H.
Agriculture and Nutrition, Diamond Shamrock and Thompson.
   To date, about 250,000 people have filed preliminary claims for
compensation. Weinstein set a Jan. 1, 1989, deadline for
applications.
   Of the claims to date, only about 40,000 to 60,000 may be
eligible for the payments, said John Gomperts, an attorney working
on the settlement.
   Gomperts said the first payments could be sent out within six
months.
   Projections estimate the disability benefits would average
$5,700 to $12,800, to be paid over a number of years.
   A veteran would have to prove ``total'' disability and that he
or she was exposed to Agent Orange while in Vietnam.
   The death payments, estimated from $1,800 to $3,400, would be
paid to families in a lump sum.
   The assistance program will issue grants and distribute money to
social service projects over a seven-to-10-year period, with an
emphasis on projects to benefit Vietnam veterans' children with
birth defects.
   Ten million dollars from the assistance program's $52 million
budget would be placed into a special reserve for 25 years to cover
possible claims in state courts and also to compensate injured
Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange should future evidence
indicate a ``legally cognizable'' link between exposure to the
herbicide and specific ailments.
   Weinstein also ruled that 2,440 veterans who opted out of the
settlement on the advice of their lawyers could be reinstated as
members of the class and receive benefits from the fund.

   Pentagon officials raised ``the possibility''
that a military identification signal received by the cruiser
Vincennes may have been sent by a military jet and not the Iranian
commercial airliner shot down by one of the ship's missiles, Rep.
Les Aspin said today.
   But a Navy spokesman, Lt. Brian Cullin, said, ``We do not
believe there was another aircraft in the area.''
   Aspin, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said that
possibility was raised Tuesday by Defense Department officials who
met behind closed doors with House members to discuss Sunday's
attack by the Vincennes, in which all 290 people on the Iranair
jetliner died.
   Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said Tuesday the Vincennes'
sophisticated electronic equipment had picked up transmissions from
Iran Air flight 655 on a military frequency, leading the crew of
the cruiser to think it was firing at an Iranian F-14 fighter.
   The Pentagon officials who briefed the House members ``said they
were examining a wide range of possibilities about what happened,''
Aspin said today.
   ``We pressed them on the military transmission angle, the fact
that the Vincennes said it was receiving on a military channel''
from the airliner, he said.
   ``We were told that there were three possibilities. One is that
the Airbus had in fact been broadcasting on both civilian and
military frequencies; the second is the fact that people on the
Vincennes made a mistake in reading the information, and the third
is that there was a second plane that was a military plane,'' he
said.
   ``The possibility exists that there was a military plane that
was somehow masked'' by the airliner, he said.
   The Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system used by the
Vincennes as part of the identification process ``is good, but it
also has a lot of limitations,'' said Aspin, a Wisconsin Democrat.
   ``For one thing, it's not very good at determining altitudes,''
Aspin said. He said that if there were a second plane, its
existence could be one explanation of the wide divergence between
reports about the altitude of the Airbus.
   The Vincennes thought the Airbus was at about 7,000 feet, but
Howard said Tuesday that the USS Sides, another ship in the area,
had tracked the jetliner's altitude at above 12,000 feet.
   The Vincennes efforts to identify the plane were hampered by the
lack of an airborne radar system in the vicinity, said Adm. William
Crowe, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who on Sunday
acknowledged that downed plane was an airliner.
   ``There was no air cover,'' Crowe said Sunday. The United States
does operate E-2 Hawkeye and Airborne Warning and Control (AWACS)
reconnaissance aircraft with sophisticated look-down radar in the
region, but they were not aloft at the time of the incident.
   Crowe was asked on Sunday whether any other Iranian aircraft
were in the area, and said ``there was an F-4 up later. Whether it
had been up all the time or earlier, we're not able to determine.
... It didn't play a part in this.'' The F-4's and F-14's were
among the U.S.-made weapons sold to Iran during the reign of Shah
Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who was overthrown in 1979.

   The state's highest court has ruled
West Virginia's gun law unconstitutional, which some authorities
say means people may legally carry concealed weapons.
   The state Supreme Court ruling ``effectively invalidated
prohibition against carrying dangerous and deadly weapons,'' state
police Superintendent W.F. Donohoe said Tuesday.
   ``However, all other firearms-related charges are still valid,
such as brandishing, assault with a deadly weapon, etc.,'' he said.
   A Department of Public Safety spokesman said authorities are
worried about an increase in gun-related crimes.
   ``Absolutely, people are carrying weapons indiscriminately;
people are going to be shot with tempers flying; there are going to
be increases in assaults with police officers, increases in deaths
in domestic situations,'' said Trooper Ric Robinson.
   ``It in general puts everyone in a far more dangerous posture.''
   The court unanimously ruled Friday that a 1986 state
constitutional amendment invalidated a 1975 law requiring permits
for people carrying concealed weapons.
   The amendment, overwhelmingly passed by voters, guarantees that
``a person has the right to keep and bear arms for the defense of
self, family, home and state, and for lawful hunting and
recreational use.''
   Supporters, including the National Rifle Association, said it
simply reinforced existing rights and was not a threat to state gun
laws.
   Donohoe said the ruling leaves some areas unclear.
   ``It is still an unanswered question as to whether (the law) is
still enforceable against non-firearm dangerous and deadly weapons,
such as dirks, bowie-knives and billy clubs,'' he said.
   The Supreme Court ruling stemmed from the 1987 arrest of a man
on drunken driving charges. When Princeton police tried to charge
him with carrying a concealed weapon, Magistrate Harold L. Buckner
cited the constitutional amendment and refused to issue the warrant.
   A circuit judge upheld Buckner, and the state Supreme Court
agreed. Justices also ruled that the Legislature can issue new gun
control laws which would stand up under the ruling.
   Senate Judiciary Chairman Larry Tucker, a Democrat, says he
thinks police can handle the situation until next regular session
in January. The state already has had three special sessions this
year, and ``it would be a waste of money to come back again,'' said
Tucker.
   Under the stricken law, West Virginians were allowed to carry
firearms without permits only to and from a place of purchase or
repair, an authorized shooting range or during hunting seasons.
Violation meant a mandatory six-month jail sentence for first
offenders. A second offense was a felony.
   Robinson said those constraints are gone: ``If you want to take
a pistol and stick it in your pocket, your purse, your swim trunks,
the Supreme Court decision allows that.''
   But he said he did not think most West Virginians now were
packing guns. ``I'd say most people are not aware of the
decision,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A 69-year-old woman who waged a 14-year
court battle to be a Boy Scout leader says she's going to form her
own troop now that the scouts have lifted a ban against woman
volunteers.
   Catherine Pollard plans to organize her new troop in September
in Milford, where about 1,000 children and adults already
participate in scouting programs.
   The Milford Volunteer Fire Co. voted in April to sponsor a Boy
Scout troop and will allow the group to meet at its headquarters.
   ``As soon as the word of mouth gets out, I don't expect it'll
take long,'' Pollard said Tuesday.
   Pollard took legal action after her application for a leadership
position was denied by the Boy Scouts in 1974 and 1976.
   She was rejected by the scouts even though she had run a Milford
troop from 1973 to 1975 when no men volunteered. The Boy Scouts
contended that a woman was not a good role model for young boys
enrolled in scouting.
   Pollard successfully challenged the action before the state
Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities, but that ruling was
later reversed in state courts. The state Supreme Court in July
1987 upheld a lower-court ruling that boys need the guidance of men
``in the difficult process of maturing to adulthood.''
   But in February, the Boy Scouts of America did away with all
gender restrictions on volunteer positions, abandoning its
78-year-old policy that banned women from six leadership roles.

<HEAD>ABC Moves Up Massive Miniseries Because of Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC said today it will run the first part of the
30-hour miniseries ``War and Remembrance'' in November, earlier
than originally planned, because of the strike by the Writers Guild
of America.
   All three major networks are struggling to come up with original
programming this fall, since the four-month-long strike has delayed
production of new series. NBC will have the Summer Olympics in
September.
   ``War and Remembrance,'' based on the Herman Wouk novel, is the
sequel to ``Winds of War,'' a miniseries which ran on ABC in 1983.
Robert Mitchum, Jane Seymour, Sir John Gielgud, Hart Bochner, Polly
Bergen and Victoria Tennant star in the saga of a family during
World War II.
   ABC Entertainment President Brandon Stoddard said the first 18
hours of the miniseries will be shown over 11 days beginning
Sunday, Nov. 13. Stoddard had previously said the miniseries would
run in February. The remainder will be shown in the 1989 television
season.
   ``When we began planning for `War and Remembrance' five years
ago, the problems of production logistics, budgeting and scheduling
seemed insurmountable. But in retrospect, I'm very glad we didn't
pass it up,'' said Stoddard, who termed the Dan Curtis-produced and
directed film a ``masterwork.''
   ``We never imagined that the film's premiere would be affected
by a labor dispute, but in our determination to provide best
possible entertainment this fall, we now will be leading with our
most excitement television event.''
   ``War and Remembrance'' is expected to be the last of the
big-time, multipart miniseries for a long time. The last,
``Amerika,'' also on ABC, was a disappointment in the ratings.
Networks are favoring instead four-hour miniseries that can be run
in two nights.
   ``Winds of War'' followed career Navy officer Victor ``Pug''
Henry (Mitchum) and his family through events leading up to World
War II. ``War and Remembrance'' begins a week after the bombing of
Pearl Harbor and follows Henry and his family through the war.

<HEAD>Market Ignores Iran-U.S. Crisis, Trading Pros Say They've Seen It

   Oil traders say the uncertainty caused in the
Persian Gulf by the U.S. destruction of an Iranian jetliner is less
worrisome for price prospects than discord among the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   Iran's vows of vengeance against the United States had little
effect Tuesday on the oil markets, and experts said they saw little
chance that heightened hostilities in the gulf would constrict
shipping or inflate crude prices. The 13-nation OPEC cartel was
once able to dictate prices through its ability to constrict
supplies.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, a sensitive barometer of
world prices, the contract for August delivery of West Texas
Intermediate crude oil rose 15 cents a barrel Tuesday to $15.09 in
light trading. Crude prices rose further this morning to $15.31.
   But traders ascribed the rise to short-term speculative buying.
Many emphasized that the market remained depressed because of
worldwide oversupply, and said the outlook for prices was down.
   ``Demand is small and supply is great, and as we see it right
now, no one's going to listen to what the Iranians say,'' said
Thomas McKiernan, head of McKiernan & Co., an energy-futures
trading concern in New York.
   Others said traders were preoccupied with evidence that two
members of OPEC, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq, were ignoring
output restraints, selling into a market already glutted with oil.
   ``The market's concerned with the possibility we may be drifting
into another price war situation, based on the fact that you now
have two members of OPEC that are overtly flouting their quotas,''
said Morris Greenberg, director of energy analysis at the Wefa
Group, a forecasting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
   ``For the other members it's difficult to justify sticking to
their quotas,'' Greenberg said. ``As a result, it can lead to a
situation where you have a complete breakdown.''
   The $15-a-barrel range where prices are now is $3 less than
OPEC's target and is the lowest level this year. Greenberg said he
saw the possibility of $14-a-barrel oil shortly and $12-a-barrel
oil if OPEC cannot discipline itself.

<TEXT>
   Soviet officials have completed
inspections at two U.S. intermediate-range nuclear rocket sites in
West Germany and are preparing to return home, U.S. military
officials said today.
   U.S. Air Force officials said the teams had returned to
Rhein-Main Air Base near Frankfurt after a full day of inspections
and planned to return to the United States on Thursday.
   Nineteen Soviet specialists split into two teams on Tuesday to
carry out their first inspections under the superpower treaty
eliminating intermediate-range nuclear weapons.
   The Soviet inspectors arrived in West Germany on Monday.
   Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. Pat Maloney said the inspections
took place at Wueschheim and Schwaebisch-Gmuend.
   The Wueschheim cruise missile site is 25 miles south of Koblenz.
   The Mutlangen Pershing 2 missile site at Schwaebisch-Gmuend is
27 miles east of Stuttgart.
   American inspectors have gone to the Soviet Union to examine
intermediate-range nuclear missile sites there, while another team
of Soviet experts is checking sites in the United States.
   The checks are called ``base line'' inspections in the treaty,
which was signed in December by President Reagan and Kremlin leader
Mikhail Gorbachev. Their purpose is to make sure that items found
at the missile sites correspond to what has been listed by the
superpowers in their agreement.
   There are six bases in West Germany with a total of 220
intermediate-range nuclear missiles to be inspected by the Soviets.
   The other sites include Pershing 2 bases at Neu-Ulm and
Neckarsulm.
   In addition, a Pershing 2 storage site is located at Weilerbach,
and a missile maintenance facility is located in the Frankfurt
suburb of Hausen.
   They will be inspected later, military officials said.

<HEAD>Doctor Files $26 Million Slander Lawsuit in `Drug Experiment'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A doctor accused of giving an anti-convulsion
drug to pregnant women without their knowledge is fighting back
with a $26 million slander lawsuit, saying the treatment was not
secret and was aimed at helping his patients.
   Hospital officials have accused physicians Lawrence Lavine and
Antonio Aldrete of secretly giving injections of the drug Dilantin
to as many as 240 women _ nearly all of them pregnant _ as part of
an improper experiment.
   But in a lawsuit Tuesday, Lavine accused Dr. Agnes Lattimer,
medical director of Cook County Hospital, of slander for calling
the Dilantin injections a violation of hospital policy and for
labeling them unethical.
   ``They (Lavine and Aldrete) did what doctors do all the time ..
. try to ensure the health of their patients. And because of the
outcry, now the hospital is going to crucify them,'' said Lavine's
attorney, Richard Brauer.
   Lattimer declined comment on the lawsuit Tuesday afternoon. ``I
cannot discuss this issue since it is a legal matter,'' she said.
   Brauer said the doctors gave the Dilantin in the course of
treating the women shortly before their babies were delivered and
not as an experiment.
   He contended that informed written consent was obtained from
every patient treated, while hospital officials have contended that
many patients were given the drug without their knowledge or
consent.
   The doctors, who face a disciplinary hearing July 18,
administered the anti-convulsants for four months beginning last
September, after receiving approval from the hospital's medical
staff for a study involving 50 women undergoing emergency Caesarean
section.
   One of the women allegedly given the drug at Cook County has
filed a lawsuit against the Cook County Board, the hospital, the
doctors and other staff members.
   Brauer said giving anti-convulsants to pregnant women with
epilepsy just before they go into labor ``has been accepted medical
procedure since 1938.''
   Brauer said the doctors ``were aware of the medical literature
(on Dilantin) and knew well in advance it would be helpful across
the range of pregnancy,'' especially in cases where inadequate
pre-natal care appeared likely to cause fetal distress from
insufficient oxygen at delivery.
   Because of the frequency of fetal distress, he said, the rate of
infant mortality at Cook County was 3{ times higher than in the
general population.
   ``And it became so obvious the babies were born healthier, the
mothers suffered less ... that instead of risking the health of
their patients, they used the anti-convulsants where they were
appropriate,'' he said.
   After media reports on the practice in late May, Lattimer said
the doctors had gone beyond the scope of the experiment.
   A week later, she told the Chicago Sun-Times, ``It was wrong for
the physicians to violate the ethical principles as well as the
rules and regulations of the hospital.''

<HEAD>Perot Contract Suspension Recommended</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hearing examiner is considering recommending
that a contract between the U.S. Postal Service and Texas
billionnaire H. Ross Perot be ordered suspended. It has been
challenged by would-be competitors who did not get to bid.
   Whatever recommendation is made will go before a judge at the
General Services Administration Board of Contract Appeals, with a
decision likely soon, a board official said today.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
examiner is expected to recommend that the contract be suspended.
   The hearing examiner, Catherine Hyatt, declined to comment on
the matter.
   At a hearing Tuesday Perot and officials of the Postal Service
refused to comply with requests to provide documents or have
individuals testify before the board, the GSA board official said.
   Postal officials acknowledged that they declined to cooperate
with the agency, arguing that it lacks jurisdiction over the Postal
Service.
   Suspension of the Perot contract was sought by Electronic Data
Systems Corp., Perot's former company which is now a part of
General Motors, and by Planning Research Corp. of McLean,. Va.
Those firms argued that the Postal Service should have sought
competitive bids before awarding the contract to Perot.
   The contract is in two phases. The first is a $500,000 agreement
calling for Perot to analyze postal operations and recommend ways
to save money. It was announced June 2 and immediately drew
criticism from a variety of sources.
   After the first 90-day phase, there was to be a second part, in
which Perot would be paid a percentage of any savings the service
realized from implementing his recommendations.
   The Senate, meanwhile, has requested the General Accounting
Office to invesitigate terms of the deal, and directed the Postal
Service to delay phase two of the contract while that analysis is
underway.
   The Senate vote called on the GAO to look into the contract and
report to the Senate within 45 days. It also called on the Postal
Service to delay implementation of any second phase of the contract
for 45 days to give the Senate time to study the GAO report.
   Thus, if the study suggests changes in postal operations,
implementation could be delayed by at least a month by the Senate
action.

<HEAD>Neurosurgeon Tells Minority Students To Be the Best</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PHILADELPHIA _ A 36-year-old neurosurgeon who was born and grew
up in Detroit's inner city told a group of minority high school
students attending an Ivy League summer seminar to focus on
in-depth, not superficial, learning.
   ``You young people are particularly the ones who can make a
difference in American society,'' Dr. Benjamin Solomon Carson said
Tuesday. ``You are the ones who can erase some of the
misconceptions _ not just by getting in the door, but by being the
best at what you do.''
   Carson, chief of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins
University and Hospital in Baltimore, led a 70-member medical team
in 1987 that separated 7-month-old West German twins, who were
joined at the head. The operation, over the Labor Day weekend, took
22 hours.
   The struggle for civil rights, Carson said, is now in ``phase
two.''
   ``Those blessed with intellectual gifts must use them,'' he
said. ``Set your sights on a goal and pursue it relentlessly.''
   He was the keynote speaker Tuesday night at the opening banquet
for the Leadership, Education and Development Program, at the
Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.
   LEAD is designed to introduce minority high school juniors to
business concepts during four-week summer sessions on several
college campuses. Thirty students from across the nation are
participating in the program at Penn.
   Carson was born and grew up in Detroit's inner city. His mother,
who married at 13, had only a third-grade education. His father
left the family when Carson was 8 years old; his mother reared two
sons alone.
   Carson said he moved from the bottom of his class in elementary
school to earning the highest academic average at his predominantly
white junior high school.
   However, even after he realized he was gifted intellectually,
his temper and peer pressure almost diverted him from his goal, he
said.
   ``I was the kind of person who got mad if you even looked at me
the wrong way,'' he said. ``When I was 14, I stabbed a boy. He was
wearing a belt with a really big buckle. The knife glanced off of
it. If it wasn't for that buckle, I wouldn't be here tonight.''
   Carson said the episode was a major turning point in his life.
   Another factor that determined his success was his mother's
insistence that he and his brother read, he said.
   ``My mother allowed us to watch only two or three hours of
television per week,'' he said. ``She required us to read at least
two books each week and submit book reviews _ to her. It wasn't
until later that we learned she couldn't read them.''
   Carson graduated from Yale in 1973, received his medical degree
from the University of Michigan in 1977 and became chief of
pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins in 1985.
   Corporate sponsors of LEAD include McNeil Consumer Products,
Scott Paper Co., and UNISYS. The program was founded at the
University of Pennsylvania in 1980.

   Police say an 89-year-old invalid woman begged her
husband to ``end her pain'' before he shot her to death in her bed
at a nursing home.
   Walter Joseph Cottrell, 87, was arrested minutes after the
shooting Tuesday morning at the Laboure Care Center on the St. Paul
Medical Center campus.
   His wife, Cora Lee, had been a patient at the home since March
after suffering a stroke, said David Marchetto, spokesman for the
medical center.
   ``She couldn't eat, couldn't swallow and she was in a great deal
of pain in her legs,'' Detective Cathy Harding said. ``She just
asked her husband to end her pain.''
   Mrs. Cottrell reportedly had been in poor health for 15 years.
The stroke had left her right side paralyzed.
   Friends of the couple said Cottrell was devoted to his wife of
65 years, visiting her daily. The Cottrells did not have any
children, Marchetto said.
   ``There's nothing to indicate that he called any attention to
himself,'' said Detective Rick Silva. ``He apparently went in and
shot her one time in the head.''
   Marchetto said after the shooting, Cottrell ``just put the gun
down and waited. He didn't threaten our staff at all.''
   According to care center administrator Dawn Price, a staff
member heard the gunshot and ran to Mrs. Cottrell's room.
   Silva said Cottrell was charged with murder and released after
posting a $5,000 bond.

   President Reagan's spokesman said today the
White House has begun the process of selecting someone to succeed
Attorney General Edwin Meese III at the Justice Department.
   Meese, meanwhile, arrived for a ``personal chat'' with Reagan,
and spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that the attorney general had
resigned voluntarily.
   Asked whether Meese could have remained if he had wished,
Fitzwater replied, ``Absolutely. The president has expressed full
confidence in Ed Meese at all times.''
   Describing the attorney general's call to Reagan notifying the
president that he was stepping down, the spokesman said, ``The
president said, `OK, if that's your determination'.''
   Fitzwater said Reagan did not try to dissuade his longtime
friend, respecting Meese's wish to step aside.
   Fitzwater, holding his daily White House news briefing, said
Reagan this morning ``briefly discussed'' the search for a
successor with chief of staff Kenneth Duberstein and White House
counsel A.B. Culvahouse.
   ``We are beginning the search immediately,'' the spokesman said.
Officials are looking for someone with ``courage, strength and
integrity,'' he said.
   If a new attorney general has not been confirmed by the time
Meese leaves in late July or early August, Fitzwater said, the
administration probably would install Solicitor General Charles
Fried in the job on an acting basis. Fried is outranked by two
Justice Department newcomers, Deputy Attorney General Harold
Christensen and Associate Attorney General Francis Keating, neither
of whom has been confirmed.
   Even though Meese told Reagan ``some time ago'' that he wanted
to leave office before the end of the administration, his
resignation announcement apparently caught the White House off
guard.
   The president even admitted Tuesday, shortly after Meese made
his plans clear, that he had ``nobody in mind'' to take his
longtime friend's place at the helm of the Justice Department.
   Another indication that the White House was surprised by Meese's
announcement came late Tuesday, when it took officials 3{ hours to
prepare a three-paragraph formal statement from the president about
Meese's decision.
   Normally, when the White House is informed in advance of such a
step, the formal statements are released within short order of the
announcement.
   Some details provided by White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
about how Meese informed Reagan indicate that the president, as
well as the senior White House staff, were somewhat taken aback by
the timing of the announcement.
   Fitzwater said Reagan took Meese's call at about 4 p.m., just as
Reagan was leaving the White House for a helicopter ride to Walter
Reed Army Medical Center to visit hospitalized Salvadoran President
Jose Napoleon Duarte.
   The spokesman said Reagan spoke with Meese ``for a minute or
two'' in the White House physician's office, which is just steps
from the exit to the helicopter pad.
   ``The attorney general said he had determined that he would like
to resign and return to private life, adding that he would like to
make the announcement very soon,'' Fitzwater said.
   The spokesman quoted Reagan as telling Meese he would accept the
resignation ``if that's your determination.''
   Fitzwater added that Reagan ``later said the attorney general
had told him some time ago that he might want to leave before the
end of the administration'' and that ``the president left the
timing up to him.''
   The spokesman did not indicate when Meese first told Reagan he
might want to leave.
   Upon his return to the White House, Reagan defended his longtime
California friend as ``a darn good attorney general'' and did not
mention the controversies that have swirled about his years in
office.
   In his statement, Reagan said Meese can ``look back with
satisfaction on the contribution'' he'd made to the Department of
Justice.
   ``For more than two decades now, Ed has been a good friend and a
close adviser; his gift for developing and succinctly summarizing
policy options is one of the most unique I have encountered in my
experience in government,'' Reagan said.
   Reagan's chief of staff, Kenneth Duberstein, was besieged by
reporters, questioning him about the resignation.
   Asked if Reagan tried to talk Meese out of it, the chief of
staff said, ``It was his determination. Ed, when he called, was
determined.''

   Mexicans turned out today to vote for a new
president and congress in an election that is expected to leave the
governing party in power but also illustrate its eroding influence.
   Virtually all industry and commerce closed for the day. The
polls opened at 8 a.m. for 14 hours.
   The Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, has won every
presidential election since it was founded in 1929. But its
candidate, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, 40, faced the party's
stiffest competition in years.
   He was expected to win, but the party is likely to face a
tougher challenge convincing Mexicans and international observers
that the results are credible.
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas on the left and Manuel J. Clouthier of the
conservative National Action Party, the strongest contenders, both
made alleged vote fraud by the governing party a major campaign
issue.
   They vowed to challenge the results if tampering was suspected.
   The other candidates, Rosario Ibarra de Piedra of the small,
radical Revolutionary Workers' Party and Gumersindo Magana of the
conservative Mexican Democratic Party, issued similar warnings.
   Salinas de Gortari said he wanted an honest election and
prefered to win by a smaller, credible margin rather than trying to
beat the margin of his predecessor.
   President Miguel de la Madrid won 70 percent of the vote in
1982. His term expires Dec. 1 and under the Constitution cannot be
re-elected.
   In the northern city of Chihuahua, about 350 people waited in
line at a polling station in a neighborhood traditionally
supporting the governing party.
   Armando and Maria de Jesus Lucero and their daughter, Mireya,
were first in line and said they had been waiting since 5:30 a.m.
``We have always voted,'' Armando said. ``We don't mind waiting.''
   Lines also formed in Mexico City. People read newspapers or
chatted while they waited for the polls to open.
   In addition to president, voters will elect 500 members of the
Chamber of Deputies to three-year terms and 64 senators to six-year
terms.
   Unofficial results are expected a few hours after polls close
this evening. Partial results from the Federal Electoral Commission
are expected late today and official, final results next week.
   The campaign was marred Saturday by the gunshot slayings of
Francisco Xavier Ovando, a long-time Cardenas collaborator and
strategist in his campaign, and an assistant to Ovando.
   Jorge Obrador Capellini, Mexico City judicial police director,
said Tuesday that the shootings were not politically motivated.
   He said Ovando was killed in revenge for fighting organized
crime while serving as Michoacan attorney general when Cardenas was
governor of the state.
   Capellinio said police have 15 suspects in the slaying but have
made no arrests.
   The campaigns of Cardenas and the other opposition candidates
injected new life into Mexican politics. One effect, political
analysts say, may be to draw more of the 38 million registered
voters to the polls. About 25 percent did not vote in the 1982
election.
   The governing party, after years of facing weak opposition or
none at all, was up against a clear right and left, a situation
that led Salinas de Gotari to run as representative of the
``progressive center.''
   The splintered left, except for Mrs. Ibarra, consolidated behind
the 54-year-old Cardenas, who once led a dissident movement in the
governing party's left wing.
   Cardenas is representing the National Democratic Front on a
platform of renewed nationalism and is aided by the affection
Mexicans still feel for his father, the late President Lazaro
Cardenas.
   His popularity surged near the end of the campaign when Heberto
Castillo of the Mexican Socialist Party withdrew from the race and
gave Cardenas his support.
   Irritation over inflation, unemployment, deterioration of the
environment, government corruption and the lack of an alternative,
wrote political scientist Lorenzo Meyer, ``has spilled into a
demand, ever more open and shared by larger groups, for change in
the political structures.''
   Salinas de Gortari, a Harvard-educated economist, was
handicapped by having been de la Madrid's budget director and
author of his economic austerity program. He has pledged to
modernize the country's economic and political systems.
   Cardenas has said he would stop the government from selling
state-owned companies. He also favors suspending payments on the
$104 billion foreign debt while it is renegotiated.
   Clouthier would return even more state-owned companies to the
private sector and ask farmers if they want the current system of
cooperative farms or private property.
   Much, political analysts say, will depend on what parties,
particularly the loosely-bound left, do after the election.
   ``The country will not be the same after the round of today and
its consequences,'' wrote columnist Miguel Angel Granados Chapa in
the weekly Punto. ``But nor will its nature change so vastly in one
shift of the rudder.''

   Authorities today arrested scores of
anti-abortion demonstrators who blocked the doors of a women's
clinic in a protest at which they weepingly displayed a 19-week-old
fetus.
   About 400 abortion opponents gathered at the Northeast Women's
Center, the day after a previous demonstration at a clinic in Paoli
resulted in 591 arrests.
   The protesters blocked doors to the women's center in defiance
of a federal court order, and arrests began after the order was
read to them and they refused to disperse. They submitted
peacefully to officers and were carried away in sheriff's
department buses 32 at a time.
   The demonstrators were to be charged with defiant trespass, a
charge that carries a maximum penalty of a $300 fine and 90 days in
jail, police said.
   ``We're going to prevent them from doing any abortions,'' said
Juli Loesch, a spokeswoman for Operation Rescue, a coalition based
in Binghamton, N.Y., that organized the protest. ``We think that
saving one life makes thousands and thousands of sacrifices
worthwhile.''
   Seven patients were already inside the clinic before the
demonstrators began arriving, said Frances Sheehan, a pro-choice
activist.
   Randall A. Terry, national director of Operation Rescue,
displayed the fetus in a box, draped with cloth.
   ``It is an aborted baby,'' said Lowell Patterson, an Operation
Rescue spokesman. ``We are challenging the media to show it. ... We
believe if we could get that in print, the attitudes toward
abortion would change. We believe the pictures are what upset
people so much.''
   Patterson said he did not know the source of the fetus or
whether it had been purchased.
   The demonstrators, gathering here for three days, blockaded the
Women's Suburban Clinic on Tuesday in violation of two court
orders. Demonstrators who refused to leave surrendered quietly to
deputies who carried them away on stretchers.
   Ms. Loesch declared the demonstration ``mission accomplished''
Tuesday evening.
   ``When the government has to choose between jailing tens of
thousands of good, decent citizens or making child killing illegal,
they'll make child killing illegal,'' said Terry.
   Clinic administrator Shelley Miller said the protest would not
stop abortions.
   ``We know abortions will always exist,'' she said. ``I don't
think this protest will change that.''
   The Philadelphia-based Women's Law Project returned to federal
court Tuesday to request fines of up to $25,000 for the violation
of an order barring protesters from blocking clinic entrances, said
attorney Susan Cary Nicholas.
   U.S. District Judge Clarence C. Newcomer, who issued the order
Thursday, denied the request pending further motions, but left his
order unchanged, Ms. Nicholas said.
   Newcomer's order and a Chester County order were read to
protesters before arrests began. Deputies transported the
protesters by bus to nearby Conestoga Senior High School, where
they were videotaped and charged with defiant trespassing.
   The charge carries a maximum penalty of a $300 fine and 90 days
in jail, said Chester County District Attorney James P. MacElree
II. Plans to press more serious misdemeanor charges were dropped in
return for an agreement by protesters not to return to the clinic
after their arrests, Baynard said.
   Protesters had gathered from about 20 states, and all were
prepared to go to jail, Terry said.
   Banners hanging from the clinic roof read, ``Fund Abortions for
Women in Need'' and ``Pledge-a-Picket,'' references to attempts by
pro-abortion groups to turn the demonstration into a fund-raising
vehicle for their cause.
   The pledge drive was started to put a damper on the protesters'
enthusiasm, since pro-choice supporters were asked to pledge money
based on the number of demonstrators, said Frances Sheehan,
executive director of the Clara Bell Duvall Education Fund.
   The money will go to the Greater Philadelphia Women's Medical
Fund, which pays abortion costs for low-income women, she said.
   The total amount pledged per head as of Tuesday was $3.50, with
a nickel per person as the average pledge, she said.

   A state police officer pulled out a
hidden pistol and killed himself as he was being questioned in
connection with an alleged child molestation case, officials said.
   Sacramento County Sheriff's detectives had confiscated Donald
Herman's service pistol and searched him after he was arrested at
the state office building on Tuesday.
   He was arrested for questioning in a child molestation case
involving a 12-year-old girl from Citrus Heights, near Sacremento,
whose mother was an acquaintance of Herman.
   While he was being questioned, Herman shot himself in the head
and died. Herman, 27, of Vallejo, had been a state police officer
for 19 months.
   The second gun was missed during the search, said Curt
Soderlund, special assistant to the director of the state General
Services Administration, which oversees state police. Herman
apparently had the pistol in an ankle holster.
   ``Obviously we're saddened by this occurrence. It's very
unfortunate,'' said Soderlund.
   The suicide is being jointly investigated by Oakland police, the
Sacramento County Sheriff's Department and state police.

   Nine colleges hope to stem a growing shortage
of black public school teachers with a $3 million effort to
convince minorities they have a future in the classroom.
   Six historically black colleges in five Southeastern states will
work with three traditionally white universities to provide
enrichment and leadership programs aimed at increasing the supply
of minority teachers.
   ``There is a decline nationwide of minorities going into
teaching,'' said Billy Black, president of Albany State College,
one of the schools participating in the program. ``The idea is to
develop programs to reverse that trend.''
   Blacks currently make up an estimated 16.2 percent of the total
public school population in the region and 6.9 percent of the
teaching force.
   In seven years, predictions are that minorities will make up 30
percent of all public school students but only 5 percent of the
teachers.
   Of the estimated 1.5 million new teachers needed by the
mid-1990s, at least 500,000 should be minorities to serve the needs
of minority students, Black said.
   Historically black Albany State is a part of the University
System of Georgia. Other black schools taking part in the program
are the Tuskegee University in Tuskegee, Ala.; Bethune-Cookman
College, Daytona Beach, Fla.; Xavier University of New Orleans;
Grambling State University in Grambling, La.; and Johnson C. Smith
University of Charlotte, N.C.
   The three traditionally white universities taking part are
Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass.; Vanderbilt University in
Nashville, Tenn.; and Columbia University in New York City.
   The consortium will offer a teacher cadet program, designed to
increase the confidence of black students and boost their academic
skills; summer enrichment programs that promote teaching as a
career; and summer scholars programs that enables black students to
study at Harvard.
   Also planned are faculty exchange and enrichment programs,
minority leadership centers that offer advanced degrees school
administrators and research efforts aimed at increasing the supply
of minority teachers.
   The programs are being coordinated by the Atlanta-based Southern
Education Foundation. The BellSouth Foundation of Atlanta and the
Pew Charitable Trusts of Philadelphia have provided $1.75 million
in funding. SEF hopes to get an additional $1.25 million from other
sources.
   Katherine Kinnick of the Southern Education Foundation said
there are several possible explanations for the black teacher
shortage, including that other careers offer higher pay and that
the pool of potential teachers is shrinking because fewer blacks
are going to college.

<HEAD>Japanese Government to Lower Price for Rice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has decided to lower the price it
will pay farmers for rice this year, a government spokesman said
Wednesday.
   After a heated debate, the governing Liberal Democratic party
and the Agricultural Ministry decided to recommend that farmers be
paid $128 per 132 pounds, 4.6 percent lower than last year's price,
said Chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi.
   The price will be proposed to the Rice Council, which advises
the agriculture minister, he said. The council will consider the
proposal and make its recommendation to Agriculture Minister
Takashi Sato for a final decision.
   Distribution of rice in Japan is controlled by the government,
which buys rice from the farmers and releases it to the market as
needed.
   The government also postponed introduction of a new method of
calculating the producer's rice price. The Agriculture Ministry
says the current method, which considers all farmers in calculating
the price, sets too high a figure.
   The ministry wants to use only farms of more than 3.7 acres in
calculating the price, said Isoshi Kajii, an agriculture professor
at Tokyo Agriculture and Engineering University.
   ``Because large farms are more cost efficient, the new method
will enable the government to reduce the rice price further,'' he
said.
   Kajii said the government delayed introducing the new measure
for one year as a ``political move to tame the anger of farmers,''
who opposed Japan's recent opening of beef and citrus markets to
the United States.
   In fiscal 1986, Japanese farmers produced 11.6 million tons of
rice, while Japanese people consumed only 10.8 million tons,
according to the Food Agency. The agency also said Japan stockpiled
1.8 millon tons of rice as of October.

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Lee Teng-hui on Wednesday
welcomed delegates to a congress of the ruling Nationalist Party
with a call for open debate in this nation emerging from its
authoritarian past.
   The 13th congress of the Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang, opens
Thursday at a suburban Taipei stadium and then moves to a hillside
convention hall to chart the party's future after six decades of
leadership from the Chiang Kai-shek dynasty.
   Lee, acting chairman of the 2.4-million-member party, is
expected to be elected chairman Friday by the congress' 1,209
delegates. He has vowed to continue the political and social
liberalization begun by Chiang Ching-kuo, the son of Chiang
Kai-shek, who led the island until his death in January.
   His success could depend on the new party and government lineup,
which will determine how fast the Kuomintang moves forward with
political, economic and social change.
   The congress will elect a 180-member party Central Committee
that will name a policy-making Central Standing Committee. A
Cabinet overhaul is likely after the meeting.
   Old-guard conservatives who fled to Taiwan in 1949 with Chiang
Kai-shek after losing a civil war to the Communists on the Chinese
mainland dominate both party committees. Many are expected to step
down to make way for a new generation of leaders more sensitive to
public opinion in Taiwan.
   Lee, 65, said he hoped the delegates would be ``expressing and
stating in full during the meeting whatever opinion they may have.
Only in this way can they convey fully the wishes of the public
(and) set a truly democratic example for our party.''
   Since its founding on mainland China in 1894 by Sun Yat-sen, the
father of modern China, power in the Kuomintang has flowed from the
top down while the party exercised authoritarian rule.
   But Chiang Ching-kuo in the years before his death lifted
38-year-old martial law, allowed the formation of opposition
parties and sought to increase the power of native Taiwanese, who
constitute about 85 percent of the island's nearly 20 million
people.
   This is the first party congress in which delegates were not
handpicked by top officials and in which a Central Committee
election was not restricted to candidates proposed by the party
leader.
   Lu Kuo-ming, 36 and an electronics engineer from San Jose,
Calif., was among the 180 delegates from overseas. He acknowledged
the congress would be ``a turning point,'' but said it wasn't
likely all party elders would retire.
   The congress will take up party policy toward Communist China.
   Both the Nationalists and Communists claim to be the legitimate
government of both the Chinese mainland and Taiwan. The
Nationalists reject all official contacts with Beijing and have no
plans to drop their stated goal of national reunification.
   Last year, Chiang Ching-kuo ended a 38-year-old ban on travel to
mainland China to allow family reunions.

   Anti-apartheid activists
Wednesday announced plans for an open-air concert near Soweto to
celebrate Nelson Mandela's 70th birthday.
   The ``Concert for Peace,'' to feature some of South Africa's top
black musicians, is scheduled to run for nine hours on July 17, the
day before the jailed black leader's birthday.
   One of the scheduled performers is guitarist-singer Ray Phiri,
who performed with Paul Simon on the hit album ``Graceland.''
   Mandela was a leader of the African National Congress before his
arrest in 1962. The outlawed ANC has been waging a guerrilla
campaign to topple the white-dominated government in Pretoria.
   Organizers expressed hope that the government, which prohibits
unauthorized outdoor political meetings and has restricted groups
sympathetic to the ANC, would allow the concert to take place.
   ``If you put your foot in it, you'll be in trouble,'' said
Aubrey Mokoena, head of the organizing committee, addressing
himself to any officials who might consider halting the event.
   Plans for the concert were announced at a news conference
attended by Mandela's wife, Winnie, and youngest daughter, Zindzi.
The government has given them permission for a six-hour birthday
reunion with Mandela at Cape Town's Pollsmoor Prison, the longest
such meeting allowed since Mandela has been in jail.
   Asked how she felt about the impending reunion, Zindzi replied:
``I'd like to see my father under normal circumstances, at home.
   ``I wouldn't like to pat the government on the back,'' she
added. ``International pressure forced them to take a lenient
step.''
   Mandela's approaching birthday has intensified the international
campaign for his release. Last month, more than 70,000 people
gathered in London for a concert honoring Mandela that was
broadcast to about 60 countries.
   Mandela is widely considered the most popular leader among South
Africa's disenfranchised black majority.
   While serving a five-year sentence for incitement and leaving
the country illegally, he was charged with sabotage and conspiracy
to topple the government. He and seven colleagues were sentenced in
1964 to life imprisonment.
   Relatives of several of Mandela's co-defendants attended the
news conference and greeted the gathering with clenched-fist
salutes.
   Mokoena said organizers felt it was important to honor Mandela
despite state-of-emergency restrictions on many groups and
individuals espousing the ANC's goals of a one-man, one-vote system
and abolition of the apartheid laws which create a racially
segregated society.
   ``Even if we are operating in diminishing legal space, we feel
as a people we've got to come out and honor this great man,''
Mokoena said.
   Organizers said 14 well-known entertainers would perform free of
charge, along with amateur black performers. They said 25,000 to
30,000 people were expected to attend, and proceeds from the $2.50
tickets would go to charity.

<TEXT>
   Soldier of Fortune magazine has appealed
to readers for money it says it needs to keep publishing and fight
a $9.4 million court judgment.
   The Boulder-based magazine is appealing the award to the family
of a woman whose killer was hired through a Soldier of Fortune
classified advertisement.
   A jury in Houston made the award in March in the lawsuit filed
by Gary Wayne Black, 18, and his grandmother, Marjorie Eimann, 64.
They sought $22.5 million.
   Sandra Black, Black's mother and Mrs. Eimann's daughter, was
fatally shot in February 1985 at her home in Bryan, Texas.
   Mrs. Black's husband, Robert, was convicted of paying John Wayne
Hearn $100,000 to kill her. Hearn is serving three life terms in
Florida for that slaying and two others. Black has been sentenced
to death.
   Black contacted Hearn through a classified ad Hearn placed in
the magazine in 1984.
   Attorneys for the magazine said they had no way of knowing the
ad was for an illegal activity, and noted that the publication
stopped accepting personal service ads in January 1986.
   Maintaining that Soldier of Fortune's owner, Omega Group Ltd.,
was denied First Amendment rights to freedom of speech, the
magazine has formed the ``Omega First Amendment Legal Fund.''
   ``This will not be an easy battle,'' the editors wrote in the
July issue. ``There are many liberals and those of leftist
persuasion who would like to see SOF go under, and they're
marshaling their forces to that end.
   ``Yet, if we let this abridgement of our personal freedoms go
unchallenged, then we surely open the door to Big Brother and his
minions of the thought police,'' the editors said.
   Mark Carson, an accountant hired by the magazine to be trustee
of the fund, said about 500 readers have sent in donations for a
total of $12,000 to $15,000.
   The appeal has been estimated to cost $5,000 to $10,000 a month,
he said.
   Soldier of Fortune said it has 150,000 in subscriptions and
125,000 a month in newsstand sales.

<HEAD>Congressman Withdraws From Senate Race for Proxmire Seat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. Jim Moody withdrew today from the
Democratic primary for the Senate seat being vacated by William
Proxmire, saying he couldn't raise enough money to compete with
millionaire opponent Herbert Kohl.
   Moody said he would run in the Sept. 13 primary in an attempt to
gain re-election to the House seat he has held since 1982.
   The 52-year-old congressman said he had considered withdrawing
from the Senate race after a newspaper poll published Sunday showed
Kohl, owner of the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team, had made
substantial gains since he unexpectedly entered the race.
   ``Events of the last week made it clear I cannot succeed no
matter what I did,'' Moody said at a news conference. ``Money is
now determining this Senate race. ... I cannot compete with
millions of dollars even though every fiber of my body wants to
run.''
   Moody's withdrawal reduced the number of major Democratic
candidates to five; two Republicans have declared their candidacy
for their party's nomination.
   The general election gives state Republicans the opportunity to
fill both Senate seats. Republican Robert W. Kasten Jr. was elected
to his second term in 1986. Proxmire, who is retiring, has held his
seat for 20 years.
   Moody's decision caused some confusion in the 5th Congressional
District race; two of the other five candidates said they wouldn't
have run if Moody hadn't assured them that he had decided to give
up his seat.
   Other Democrats in the Senate primary said Moody was pressured
to quit because Kohl, who is from Milwaukee, had undermined Moody's
electoral base with an unprecedented two-month bombardment of
television commercials.
   The poll published Sunday in the Milwaukee Journal showed former
Gov. Anthony S. Earl leading the Democratic field among likely
voters with 31 percent while Kohl was in second place with 28
percent. Moody was third with 12 percent.
   Former deputy Wisconsin attorney general Edward R. Garvey also
had 12 percent while Secretary of State Douglas J. La Follette had
8 percent.
   La Follette said Kohl's television budget has disrupted
political tradition in the state.
   ``I feel badly that big money, TV hype are determining who the
candidates will be in this race,'' La Follette said.
   Kohl, 53, dismissed the notion that his wealth had forced Moody
from the race. ``To say that people of Wisconsin can be bought is
something that I've never considered. A messenger without a message
can't win.''
   Kohl, heir to a supermarket fortune and owner of the National
Basketball Association's Bucks since 1985, is a former state
Democratic chairman. He has never held elective public office.

coastal resort on this Spanish island.
   Driver Vega Moreno got out of the car to protest the act, was
struck in the brawl and collapsed on the sidewalk. Moreno, who
suffered from cardiac problems, later died of a heart attack.
   The five are being held without bail in a Palma prison pending
trial, according to Judge Mariano Zaforteza. If covicted, they
could each receive a maximum one year jail sentence, the judge said.
   They were identified as Michael Clark Baird, 21, Adrian
Houseman, 18, Edward Sheffield, 20, Lee Robert Virgo, 19, and Jason
Richard Dunn, 20, all of Bolton, Lancashire.

   A leading Soviet Bible scholar said Wednesday a
Soviet magazine plans to serialize the New Testament in an effort

   ``At first, I was shaken by such an indecency,'' said Sergei S.
Averintzev, ``but then I thought, it's good.''
   Averintzev, 61, said he was commissioned to write footnotes to
the New Testament, which is to be published in the magazine In the
World of Books. He said a Soviet publishing house also was
preparing a book edition of the New Testament with his notes.
   The scholar, who is in Israel with a delegation of Soviet
filmmakers, is a member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and has
written books and articles on ancient Greek and Byzantine culture
and the Bible.
   In a lecture at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, Averintzev said
said the magazine wanted to print the New Testament ``to enlarge
its circulation.''

   Two conscientious objectors have ended
their hunger strike after the government pledged to change the law
on non-combatant military service, their support committee said
Wednesday.
   The government announced on July 1 that alternative civilian
service had been provided for in a law to be proposed to parliament
this week.
   Mihalis Marangakis, 31, and Thanassis Makris, 23, both jailed
Greek Orthodox pacifists, were ``in bad shape'' after the fasting,
the committee said.
   Makris, a student, has been hospitalized, according to Mary
Kostidou, the committee secretary. She did not know how much weight
he had lost.
   He began fasting May 8 after a military court sentenced him to
five years in prison for resisting military service.
   Marangakis, 31, a woodcarver, started his fast May 30 to protest
Makris' sentence. Marangakis is serving a 26-month prison term for
refusing to be drafted.
   The new bill includes a provision under which the time
conscientious objectors have served in jail will be counted as
social service.

   Swedes in the northern region of
Lapland still suffer from the fallout of the Chernobyl nuclear
accident, more than two years after the Soviet disaster, according
to a study.
   Recent tests on a group of 30 Lapp reindeer herdsmen showed
cesium levels in two-thirds of them were above the safety limit,
which the National Radiation Protection Agency has set at 90,000
bequerel.
   The bequerel is a unit that measures the activity of a
radioactive substance such as cesium-137, an element of the nuclear
fallout.
   The herdsmen eat the meat of reindeer that graze on plants
polluted by radioactivity from the April 1986 nuclear accident in
the Soviet Ukraine, according to the tests, done at the Institution
for Radiophysics in the eastern city of Umea.
   The average radiation level for males in Lapland is about 55,000
bequerel, while the average for a control group of staff at a
hospital was 2,000 bequerel, the institution reported.

   The Washington Post on the resignation of Attorney General Edwin
Meese:
   He leaves office having been mightily investigated and not
indicted. Is that the measure of a successful attorney general, a
man who has served his country and his president with distinction?
Hardly. It is the minimum. ...
   While not rising to the level of rule-breaking or actual crime,
Mr. Meese's repeated intervention on behalf of friends, his sloppy
personal financial dealings and his apparent lack of understanding
of the need for exemplary, not just lawful, behavior in office have
been continuously troubling. ...
   Surely Mr. Meese and his family will be glad to leave
Washington. They have been the target of a great deal of public
abuse and have suffered more than one private tragedy during their
years here. It is understandable that he is relieved by the
independent counsel's decision, but he has done the right thing by
resigning now.

   The answers to the questions strewn like debris around the
tragic drowning of Iran Air Flight 655 won't be available for at
least two weeks. But it is not too soon for the United States to
think about an appropriate humanitarian response.
   President Reagan used the right words when he called the
incident a ``terrible human tragedy.'' But Mr. Reagan's condolences
were muffled by the whir of helicopter blades in the background,
and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. William J.
Crowe Jr., buried his statement of regret in the midst of a
briefing on the military details.
   U.S. officials are studying the question of compensation, but a
State Department spokeswoman said it is ``premature.''
   There is no shame, nor is there necessarily an admission of
guilt, in offering compensation to the families. Such a gesture
would represent America at its best.

   Portland (Maine) Press-Herald on a waiting period for sale of
handguns:
   The House Judiciary Committee ... approved a measure requiring a
national seven-day waiting period in sales of pistols. It's
unlikely it will pass, of course _ the gun lobby is terribly
powerful _ but it is, nonetheless, a sensible and reasonable idea.
   The rationale behind the waiting period is to give police time
to check as to whether the prospective purchaser has a criminal
record or mental problems. The idea is to try to keep handguns out
of the hands of criminal and the mentally ill.
   The proposal this time has a powerful ally. President Reagan,
who himself was shot by an assassin carrying a handgun, is a
supporter of the waiting period. He drew not only on his own
experience but on his task force on violent crime which made the
waiting period one of its core recommendations...

   News-Leader, Springfield, Mo., on drought relief:
   Missouri Gov. John Ashcroft says he is ready to take swift
action to bring drought relief to Missouri farmers. State Rep. Bob
Holden, D-136th District of Springfield, wants a special session of
the General Assembly to take up the relief question.
   Both ideas make sense. The sweet smell of rain may have
delivered temporary relief to drought-stricken Missouri livestock.
But it did nothing to help farmers who culled their herds before
the rains.
   Missouri would be far better off to grapple with the issues of
drought relief when they can accomplish some good than to wait
until it is too late.
   A bipartisan relief program may be the best investment Missouri
can make for farmers.

   The Lewiston (Maine) Daily Sun on the ruling on special
prosecutors:
   ... (The) U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding the power of
independent counsels to prosecute upper echelon government
employees could be bad news for several current and former Reagan
administration officials.
   Moreover, the decision's broader influence will help to maintain
the balance of power and ensure the government's system of checks
and balances _ two of the chief arguments opponents used against
the law ...
   ... The Supreme Court correctly recognized the importance of the
Ethics in Government Act. The special prosecutor is necessary to
thwart abuses of executive power by guaranteeing integrity in
investigations into possible criminal activity by high-level
officials. Without such a law, the current situation would require
the nation to rely on Attorney General Edwin Meese, who has himself
come under independent-counsel inquiries ...

   The Baltimore Sun on the shooting down of the Iranian airliner:
   Much human folly, inadvertent or inexcusable, went into the
making of the awful tragedy that befell Iran Air Flight 655. The
minute-by-minute log of the U.S.-Iranian clash that culminated in
the loss of 290 lives brings heartache to Americans and adds even
more fury to the rhetoric of Tehran's revolutionary leadership.
   The mistakes so obviously made by both sides during those
fateful 45 minutes will now be added to the 9 years of war,
slaughter, hostage-taking, fanaticism, hatred, intrigue and
cynicism that have marked the rule of the Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini....
   From the moment the Reagan administration decided in early 1987
to reflag Kuwaiti oil tankers with the Stars and Stripes, thereby
taking on the burden of protecting them within the Iran-Iraq war
zone, the danger of catastrophe was apparent....
   While we continue to question the rationale of the large U.S.
naval presence in the Gulf, we fully understand why the officers of
the USS Vincennes felt it necessary to fire missiles at an aircraft
they believed was zeroing in on their ship.
   ``U.S. investigations will have to determine just what
information was available to the Vincennes, and precisely when....
To provide credibility, these probes need international oversight.
In the meantime, the United States should not be grudging either in
offering official apologies or reparations.

   The Wichita (Kan.) Eagle-Beacon on the ruling on executing young
killers: The U.S. Supreme Court came close ... closer than it ever
had come before _ to banning the execution of children in the
United States. Because the court didn't go all the way, however,
the United States still stands itself condemned in world councils
for allowing this barbaric practice.
   ...Of the more than 11,000 court-ordered executions in the world
since 1979, according to Amnesty International, only eight were of
persons who had committed their crimes when they were less than 18.
Three of these, shamefully, were in the United States, two were in
Pakistan, and one each was in Bangladesh, Rwanda and Barbados.
   With the execption of Barbados, these aren't the kind of
countries with which the United States should want to be
associated. The Supreme Court started the dissociation with last
week's halfway ruling. It should go all the way next time.

   A fire broke out in a second-floor

children, who were trapped by the flames, fire officials said.
   Dispatch supervisor Lt. Mark Mannard said the fire occurred in
the upper-story of a unit at the La Rochelle Apartments off Pacific
Highway South in this Seattle suburb.
   Firefighters attempted to rescue the five from the three-alarm
blaze to no avail, he said.
   From 40 to 50 firefighters and five engines from five fire
departments responded to the blaze, which took about 50 minutes to
extinguish, he said.
   No injuries to firefighters or residents were reported, he said.
   The fire spread to two other units, which suffered smoke damage.
Total damage was estimated at $200,000 to $250,000, Mannard said.
   Cause of the fire was unknown and the fire marshal was
investigating, Mannard said.

   Unions will take more delegates to the
Democratic National Convention this month than they did in 1984
with their early endorsement of Walter Mondale _ and it's largely
because of Jesse Jackson, labor activists say.
   Preliminary totals from the 90-union AFL-CIO and the independent
National Education Association show a record 1,003 or 24 percent of
the convention's 4,162 delegates coming from the ranks of the labor
movement.
   In 1984, the two groups, which represent some 17 million
workers, had 903 or 22.9 percent of the 3,933 delegates at the
Democratic convention in San Francisco.
   Of the 723 union members or officials on the AFL-CIO's roster of
delegates for this year's convention, 56.4 percent are committed to
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, who has wrapped up the
nomination, and 26.6 percent are pledged to Jackson.
   Without Jackson's constant wooing of labor support through
hundreds of appearances on picket lines and in local union halls
and his populist appeal, political activists in the movement doubt
they would be carrying as large a delegation to Atlanta.
   ``There is a genuine surprise within labor at how well we have
done,'' said Allen Zack of the 1 million-member United Food and
Commercial Workers Union. ``It's the heavy influence of labor
delegates in the Jackson camp. People really went out and scrambled
to get on his slate.''
   Four years ago when its early endorsement of Mondale earned
labor the tag ``special interest'' from Mondale's primary
opponents, the AFL-CIO had a total of 642 delegates at the San
Francisco convention.
   Labor leaders looked upon Jackson and then-Sen. Gary Hart of
Colorado as spoilers to Mondale's campaign. Hart tried to make
amends in early 1987, before withdrawing his candidacy in the wake
of an uproar over the weekend he spent with a Miami model.
   Jackson began the reconciliation effort a year earlier at a
private meeting in Chicago with the AFL-CIO's Committee on
Political Education. He quietly raised $200,000 for a black voter
registration drive in the South that was instrumental in returning
the Senate to Democratic control that fall.
   ``I have a lot more respect for him than I did in 1984,'' said
Loretta Bowen, political director for the Communications Workers of
America. ``He's no longer running aganst the party. As for the gut
issues that affect organized labor, he articulated them better than
any other candidate.''
   Joan Baggett, political director for the Bricklayer's Union,
agreed that ``having Jackson in the equation helped.''
   Because Jackson was able to stay in the race until the end,
there was no repeat of the Mondale-Hart battle in 1986 where one
was perceived as being pro-labor and the other anti-labor, she said.
   ``The assumption that the labor movement would come out on the
short end of the stick, sans endorsement, was wrong all along,''
said Peter Laarman of the United Auto Workers. ``The idea was to
make it clear in a way that was not offensive or counterproductive
but simply a reflection of reality _ labor is a part of the
process.''
   Laarman said the UAW will have 101 delegates at the Atlanta
convention compared with 82 at San Francisco four years ago. Other
large union delegations this year will be the NEA with 280
delegates, the American Federation of State County and Municipal
Employees, with 159, and the American Federation of Teachers, with
152.
   Despite the expectation of some minor fights over the party's
platform, most union activists expect the convention and labor's
role in it to be relatively quiet.
   ``We've got the choir but if we're not asked to sing a chorus,
we're not going to,'' said Lorrie McHugh, a spokeswoman for the
AFL-CIO.

   Led by a jazz band, 400 teachers from 50
states staged a mock funeral procession through the streets of New
Orleans today to symbolize Louisiana's ``historic neglect of
education.''
   The four-block long procession featured teachers singing ``When
the schools are fully funded,'' to the tune of ``When the Saints Go
Marching In.''
   Following a 1.75-mile march from Jackson Square to the
Superdome, where the National Education Association is holding its
annual convention, the marchers planned to form a 50-car motorcade
to take their case for more education dollars to the state
Legislature in Baton Rouge.
   The march coincided with a showdown debate in the state Senate
on ways to finance the state budget, which includes a 5 percent
teacher pay raise. Gov. Buddy Roemer's plan to extend a 2-cent
sales tax to food, drugs, gasoline and utilities has run into stiff
opposition, raising the prospect of more budget cuts instead of pay
raises.
   At the head of the procession, just behind a hearse and the
10-member Young Tuxedo Marching Band, was NEA vice president Keith
Geiger, and Virginia Budd, president of the Louisiana Association
of Educators, the local NEA affiliate. She wore a black veil, as if
she were a grieving widow.
   ``Jazz funerals celebrate life,'' said Budd. ``This funeral
celebrates the efforts of LAE members to bring new life to our
state's educational system.''
   ``NEA members are showing support for Louisiana, to put in the
past the neglect of this state's educational system and move
forward,'' said Geiger.
   They carried a blue and white sign: ``Let's Bury Educational
Neglect.''
   One of the marchers, Sylvia Carter who teaches at Hearndon
Magnet School in Shreveport, said she had been teaching for 20
years and earns only $22,000 annually.
   Olive Hansen, a homebound teacher in Calcasieu Parish, said she
has a master's degree and 21 years' experience, yet is paid $24,000.
   ``We're ready to move forward,'' Hansen said.
   According to NEA figures, Louisiana ranks 43rd in the percentage
of total expenditures invested in education. Its 37 percent dropout
rate is the nation's worst. And it ranks 48th in average teacher
salaries.

<HEAD>Whales Make A Comeback To Stellwagen Banks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN MURPHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a five-year decline in whale activity in
Massachusetts Bay, the leviathans seem to be making a strong return
from more remote sections off the New England coast.
   Their migration back has delighted tourists and fascinated
researchers sharing the waters of the Stellwagen Bank, one of the
nation's top areas for recreational and scientific whale
observations.
   Mason Weinrich, director of the Cetacean Research Unit in
Gloucester, saw nearly 50 humpback whales surface in Stellwagen
earlier this week. It was more whales than he logged in any of the
past several years.
   ``There's no question there are more whales out there than in
recent years,'' said Weinrich, who has been studying Stellwagen
whales since the late 1970s. `` ... but we're not really sure how
long the whales will stay around.''
   Marine experts say a plentiful supply of small fish and
micro-organisms have drawn the large number of humpback, minke and
other whales from feedings grounds 50 miles east of Nantucket back
to Stellwagen, located less than 30 miles offshore from Boston.
   The tiny sand lance, a pencil-thin fish preferred by several
species of whales, is being noticed in dense concentrations in the
Stellwagen area, say experts. In addition, the small shrimp and
plankton that right whales strain through their balene plates are
abundant this year.
   Some experts theorize the whales' return to Stellwagen is linked
to heavy commercial fishing of mackerel and herring, which eat sand
lances.
   ``All the elements are right at the moment for the whales,''
said John Nicolas, biologist at the National Marine Fisheries
Service in Woods Hole.
   Nicolas estimates there may be as many as 100 humpback whales in
the Stellwagen Bank, and a smaller number minke, finback and sei
whales. For the past several years, only a few lone humpbacks
remained in Stellwagen by midsummer.
   Since the mid-1980s, most of the whales had followed the sand
lances to the Great South Canal off Nantucket, which is too distant
and the seas are too rough for tourist whale watch voyages.
   The humpback whales seen in Stellwagen are part of a larger herd
that feeds from Rhode Island to Maine. Other humpback herds are
located off Nova Scotia, Greenland and Iceland, said Weinrich.
   ``It's been pretty discouraging the last couple years,'' said
Lisa Frohock, office manager at Gloucester Whale Watch, which
operates a 100-foot vessel. ``So far this year, it's been great. We
go out and the whales are all around.''
   Al Avellar, owner of the Dolphin whale watch fleet in
Provincetown, gives a less scientific explanation to the whales'
return.
   ``It's like an old-fashioned summer, hot and sunny,'' said
Avellar, whose boats are taking up to 1,000 people to Stellwagen
each day. ``They went away about three weeks ago, but they're
back.''

   Los Angeles Times on the shooting down of the Iran airliner:
   First came shock at the news that a U.S. warship in the Persian
Gulf had shot down an Iranian airliner, with the apparent loss of
all 290 people aboard. Then came bewilderment over how such an
appalling mistake could be made. The guided-missile cruiser
Vincennes has been advertised as the latest in high-tech surface
vessels, a $1 billion dollar weapons platform that supposedly can
identify hundreds of targets at once and simultaneously engage in
anti-air, anti-submarine and anti-ship warfare.
   ...Radar, we are told, cannot distinguish between a plane the
size of an F-14 and a plane, like the Airbus, that is nearly three
times as large; both show up as identical blips on the radar
screen... Italy says that one of it naval ships in the area
confirmed through its own radar scans the U.S. account that the
Airbus was flying at least four miles outside the corridor reserved
for commercial traffic. The Italian ship also heard radio warnings
from the Vincennes to the airliner. The unanswered question is
whether the airliner heard them.
   ...Many questions about this terrible event remain to be
answered... The biggest and most overdue is what has been the point
and what if anything has been gained by the Reagan administration's
increasingly one-sided intervention in the Persian Gulf war, which
has seen it militarily confronting Iran even as it ignores Iraq's
attacks of third-country ships and its indiscriminate use of poison
gas on land... Against this background Iran is now able to allege
that the shooting down of its airliner was deliberate, and to know
that many in the world will believe the claim.

   The Albuquerque (N.M.) Tribune editorial on the Iran-Iraq war:
   The downing of an Iranian civilian airliner with 290 persons
aboard by an American warship in the Persian Gulf Sunday was a
dreadful tragedy that underscores the need to end the senseless
Iran-Iraq war.
   President Reagan was right to express promptly his deep regret
over the shooting down of the Iran Air jetliner by commanders of
the cruiser Vincennes, who believed it was an Iranian F-14 warplane
about to attack their ship.
   The United States should offer compensation to the Tehran regime
and to the families of the victims aboard the ill-fated Airbus.
   The deplorable error should convince the religious fanatics
ruling Iran that it is time to settle the eight-year bloodletting
with Iraq. Continuing the war will merely add thousands of young
corpses to the hundreds of thousands who have died uselessly before
them.

   Milwaukee Sentinel on the court martial in the Navy drowning
case:
   The decision to recommend a general court-martial for one of the
men allegedly involved in the death of Appleton, Wis., Airman
Recruit Lee W. Mirecki is an appropriate and necessary action to
establish a clear record on his ghastly demise.
   Five others charged in the drowning have been offered the option
``non-judicial'' punishment. But that hardly offsets the crimes of
involuntary manslaughter and conspiracy to commit battery that
allegedly occurred.
   Information given by others in the rescue swimming class in
which Mirecki was participating when he died suggest this was not a
mere case of overzealousness on the part of the instructors.
   Petty Officer Michael W. Combe, who has been recommended for
court-martial, was said to have held the recruit's head under water
after Mirecki panicked and asked to quit the course.
   Other recruits were ordered to turn their backs and sing the
national anthem during the incident.
   The full truth must be known.

   The Honolulu Advertiser on the shooting down of the Iranian
airliner:
   The shooting down of an Iranian commercial jetliner by a U.S.
Navy warship in the Persian Gulf is a tragic mistake that darkens
more than just America's Independence Day weekend.
   Most Americans will set their reaction by President Reagan's
statement calling the incident ``a terrible human tragedy,'' but
that it resulted from ``proper defensive action'' by a warship that
believed it was facing an attacking Iranian fighter during a
running sea battle.
   Still, the president was also putting the best possible face on
a bad situation where the United States will pay a price of
uncertain kind and dimensions.
   Besides the formal apology, there must be compensation for
families of the 290 people killed aboard the Iran Air jetliner.
That is a decent minimum.

   Spartanburg (S.C.) Herald-Journal on Angola:
   Angola's offer to negotiate withdrawal of Cuban troops from its
territory is a significant change of stance that could signal
increased stability in the whole of strife-torn southern Africa.
   For the first time, the Marxist-oriented Angolan government's
offer to repatriate its Cuban mercenaries is not linked to a demand
that the United States halt its support for the anti-government
guerrillas led by Jonas Savimbi.
   ... Angola's new offer confirms that the Soviet Union, which has
provided funds and arms for the Cubans, is weary of the 13-year-old
civil war and is anxious to withdraw as soon as possible.
   Pragmatically, Angolan officials are still demanding three
concessions from South Africa: that South African troops be
withdrawn from Angola, that South Africa stop giving aid to Savimbi
and that South-West Africa (Namibia) be granted independence.
   (South Africa's) minister of foreign affairs, Pik Botha,
startled political observers by declaring that South Africa was
ready to grant independence to South-West Africa if Cuban troops
were removed from Angola.
   ... With the scenario for southern Africa looking more hopeful
than it has for years, the United States must continue to press for
national reconciliation in Angola as the first step toward
stabilization of the whole region.

   The Ponca City (Okla.) News on arms reduction:
   Once again as party platforms are being discussed, there are
those advocating all kinds of unilateral disarmament on the part of
the United States.
   The theory expressed is that if the United States leads the way
by reducing its weapons, Russia and the other countries will follow
suit.
   That's a beautiful thought, but there is no evidence in ...
history to suggest that it would work that way.
   Unilateral disarmament should not be a part of any party's
platform, lest it should suggest a weakness to those who seek power
over us. Costly as it is, we must continue to maintain defenses
that can stand up if called on against any offense the world has to
offer.

   The old man looked out at the sea and began
the story of how he came to be skipper of Ernest Hemingway's yacht
for more than 20 years.
   ``There was a storm and I heard someone yelling for help,''
Gregorio Fuentes said. ``It was 1928 on Dry Tortugas. It was
Hemingway, and he and his companions were out of food.''
   Gregorio Fuentes, who is 90 now, pointed a wrinkled finger at a
picture of the famous writer on the wall, and glanced at it from
time to time as he told his tale.
   The old sailor sat on a shabby, flowered overstuffed chair in
the living room of his cottage in this pastel-washed fishing
village. His wife of 67 years, Dolores, was in the kitchen nearby.
   He said he gave the novelist two bottles of rum and arranged for
the yacht to be towed back to Key West, then ``We waved goodbye and
he said he we'd see each other in Cuba.''
   Fuentes went to work on merchant ships in Europe after that, and
when he returned home a decade later was told an American had been
looking for him.
   It was Hemingway, with the offer to be captain of the Pilar.
Fuentes held the job until the author's suicide in 1961.
   When that happened, Fuentes was on a warship for the Cuban
government. Fidel Castro had gained control of the island 90 miles
from Florida in 1959, and Cubans were on alert for an American
invasion.
   ``I read in the newspaper that he died,'' Fuentes said, reaching
for a large Cuban cigar. ``He was a friend. I understood. He had a
disease. ... He couldn't live with that. It's better what he did.''
   His former association with the famous writer has made Fuentes a
minor celebrity in Cuba, where Hemingway's home in San Francisco de
Paulo is a museum. Hemingway's favorite hangouts in Havana, La
Floridita and Bodeguita del Medio, are popular tourist attractions.
   A new harbor for visiting yachts has been named ``Hemingway
Marina.'' A hotel near the docks is called ``El Viejo y el Mar,''
Spanish for ``The Old Man and the Sea.''
   ``Everyone adored him,'' Fuentes said. Asked about Hemingway's
reputation for womanizing, he laughed and said: ``A man who doesn't
love women is not a man.
   Fuentes remembers the day, but not the date, the writer began
work on the ``The Old Man and the Sea,'' which was published in
1952 and made into a movie in 1957.
   ``We were sailing and he was reading,'' Fuentes said. ``He would
read and then look at me. Then he said, `Did you see a boat?'
   ``It was a small skiff and he told me to see if it needed help.
There was an old man pulling in a marlin, and a young boy. The man
yelled for us to get away but the boy was nice. Hemingway told me
to give them supplies _ milk, pineapples, oranges and crackers.''
   He said the novelist knew it would take time to reel in the
fighting marlin and offering help was typical of Hemingway, whom he
described as generous and courageous, with a fine sense of humor.
   The writer's portrait of Santiago, the main character in ``The
Old Man and the Sea,'' could be that of Fuentes today.
   ``The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back
of his neck,'' Heningway wrote. ``The brown blotches of the
benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the
tropic sea were on his cheeks. Everything about him was old except
his eyes and they were the same color as the sea and were cheerful
and undefeated.''
   Fuentes brushed back a strand of white hair and said Hemingway
went to work on the book immediately, writing on the yacht for 28
days and nights.
   Then the constant clatter of the typewriter stopped because, the
author said, he had to return to shore to pay the people who worked
for him.
   ``He always thought of other people,'' Fuentes said.
   Cojimar was the setting of the movie, which starred Spencer
Tracy.
   Fuentes has spent nearly 70 years in the fishing village beside
the ruins of Spanish colonial fort. About 70,000 people live here
now, but he recalls when there were only 200 families.
   A bust of Hemingway is in a gazebo by the ocean, cast from the
bronze fittings of fishing boats and donated by local fishermen.
Youngsters hurl out lines from the wharf nearby.
   Hemingway's former captain was born in the Canaries, the Spanish
islands off the hump of Africa, and left home at age 11 on a ship
that eventually reached Cuba.
   ``It was my dream to see the world,'' he said, and he did.
   He still enjoys a cigar and a glass of rum, and tells a visitor
of the lesson life has taught him: ``We live in the same world. We
can all get along.''

   Residents experienced another in a
series of earthquakes early Wednesday, with the latest jolt
registering 2.7 on the Richter scale.
   There were no reports of injuries or damage after the quake at
12:27 a.m. PDT, and Boulder City police say they received no calls
on the incident.
   Nearly a dozen small earthquakes have been reported in Boulder
City this year.
   John Minsch of the National Earthquake Information Center in
Golden, Colo. said Wednesday's jolt was one of the smaller ones
recorded this year. Some quakes, including one before dawn Monday,
have registered as high as 3.7 on the Richter scale.
   Minsch said he doesn't think the series of small quakes are a
forerunner to a major quake.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area.

   Vice President George Bush promised today to name
a Hispanic to his Cabinet if elected president, saying ``It's time.
It's long overdue.''
   The certain Republican nominee said he wanted to make a pledge,
``a pledge that I have never made before, to anyone, to any group.''
   He noted that women, blacks and other minorities have been named
to Cabinet positions.
   ``If I become president, my Cabinet will be composed of the very
best men and women _ at least one of whom, finally, will be a
Hispanic American.
   ``It's time. It's time. It's long overdue,'' Bush said in a
speech prepared for delivery to the League of United Latin American
Citizens.
   Bush was greeted on his arrival at the airport by a marachi band
and the leadership of LULAC, an umbrella organization of Hispanic
groups.
   Bush jokingly said ``they do have a terrible mistake _ they have
a few Democrats that are members of LULAC.''
   In his speech, Bush made clear that he wants to recruit
Hispanics away from the Democratic Party.
   ``I truly feel that a lot of you in this audience ought to
consider joining the party I represent this year,'' Bush said. ``I
think you belong with us. And don't let anyone take you, or your
support, for granted.''
   Trying to draw a contrast, Bush said, ``It's fair to say that
the other party has a tendency to take those actions that slow or
stop growth. They tend to increase taxes, while my party tends to
resist.
   ``They tend to increase regulation, while my party tilts toward
greater regulatory freedom.
   ``The other party has a recent tendency to pursue foreign policy
goals in a manner that encourages the more troubling impulses of
our adversaries,'' the vice president said. ``My party has a
tendency to deal with communism and other destabilizing forces in a
manner that combines sophistication with strength.''
   Earlier today, Bush said he would not apologize to Iran for the
shooting down of a civilian airliner and he said it was too early
to decide whether the United States should pay compensation to the
victims' families.
   Bush spoke with reporters as his plane, Air Force Two, taxied
for takeoff from Andrews Air Force Base on a campaign trip to
Dallas. Asked if the United States should apologize, he said, ``No,
but we probably ought to do what we did, which is to officially
express regret, which I guess should happen when you have the loss
of innocent life.''
   But as for an apology, Bush said, ``I wouldn't. Because of the
facts, what happened.''
   President Reagan sent a diplomatic message Sunday to Iran's
leaders expressing ``deep regret'' for the military action that
brought down a civilian plane, killing all aboard. Reagan was asked
Tuesday if he ha apologized sufficiently to Iran and he responded,
``Yes.''
   Bush said it was ``too early to consider'' reparations to the
victims' families. ``Wait til we know all the facts,'' he said.

   Dallas Morning News on White House cocaine use:
   The news ... that several White House staffers had been
disciplined for cocaine use brought some jibes that first lady
Nancy Reagan needs to implement the ``just say no'' program in her
own backyard.
   But the continuing Washington investigation demonstrated how
pervasive the drug abuse problem is in this country. Three members
of the Secret Service's uniformed division at the White House were
placed on administrative leave, and two National Security Council
employees were fired in the drug investigation.
   Evidence continues to mount that no segment of the population is
exempt from the substance abuse problem. A federal call for drug
testing of interstate truck drivers in June was accompanied by some
hair-raising information about research in several states: One test
in Tennessee showed that 15 percent of the drivers tested positive
for marijuana, cocaine or prescription stimulants; 36 percent of
1,300 truckers surveyed in Florida said they sometimes drove under
the influence of drugs.
   The sobering thought is how much worse it might be if the drugs
in question were legalized.

   The Westerly (R.I.) Sun on using blimps to hunt drug smugglers:
   Air Force surveillance planes designed to find and track
high-speed military aircraft have not been of much use against the
slow-moving, low-altitude planes used by drug traffickers. Better
performance can reasonably be expected from a balloon newly
tethered near the Mexican border in southern Arizona.
   The blimp's radar range is about 160 miles, permitting detection
of aircraft in an 80,000 square-mile area.
   The goal of Customs officials is to deploy six such balloons
along the Southwest border. Even when they are all fully
operational, that will be no guarantee against low-flying smuggler
aircraft ... This new approach does promise, however, to make
things considerably more difficult for the traffickers.

   The Jersey Journal of Jersey City, N.J., on increased federal
funding for drug treatment:
   One of the latest to call for expanded drug abuse treatment is
the board of directors of the American Medical Association... .
   The board also urged a change in the rules to make it easier for
drug users to get on methadone programs. Increased funding would be
needed to make a change in the rules effective.
   While a prosperous state like New Jersey, which suffers
especially hard from AIDS among drug users, must not shirk its
share of the additional burden, it's important to see expanded
federal funding for treatment as well. There are some congressional
proposals for such an expansion and they deserve very high priority.

   Journal-American, Bellevue, Wash., on special prosecutors:
   The Supreme Court's decision upholding the law on independent
prosecutors has been characterized as a defeat for the Reagan
administration, which it is, but it will surely have a more
important effect in the long run.
   In a 7-1 decision, the court held that a 1978 law providing for
appointment by judges of special prosecutors to investigate
suspected crimes does not violate the Constitution's provision for
separation of the executive and legislative branches of government.
That law was enacted in the wake of the Watergate scandal, to
prevent any future president from copying President Nixon, who
tried to halt the breakdown of his administration by ordering the
special prosecutor's dismissal. ...
   The ruling vindicates the Ethics in Government Act _ both in
purpose and legality _ and leaves the nation with assurance that
justice at the highest levels of government need not be tainted by
politics.

   Seattle Post-Intelligencer on the Environmental Protection
Agency:
   A group of Republican senators is sponsoring a bill to elevate
the Environmental Protection Agency to a Cabinet-level department.
   The threat to the biosphere is such, regrettably, that it's an
idea whose time has come.
   The president must have more direct involvement in environmental
issues than has been the case, argues Sen. David Durenberger,
R-Minn., a prime sponsor of the bill. Cabinet officers help set
broad policies for the nation. As is, the agency does not have a
close, direct relationship with the president nor does the head of
the agency have the access to the president that a Cabinet member
would have.
   But with such threats looming as severe damage to the planet
caused by burning fossil fuels, environmental concerns must be made
a top governmental and presidential priority. Damage from the
greenhouse effect will touch on nearly every aspect of human life.
That makes it imperative that those responsible for overseeing the
nation's environmental affairs be part of the Cabinet's policy
discussions on energy, agriculture, transportation, commerce, and
health and human services, to name some key Cabinet departments
that will have to cope with the creeping crisis.

   The Dallas Times Herald on Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the party
congress:
   Communist orthodoxy has been taken to the woodshed. In a
remarkable speech before a special party conclave in Moscow,
Mikhail Gorbachev said many of the Marxist concepts of the past,
such as a strong central government and tightly controlled
production of consumer goods, must be trashed.
   The Soviet leader called for a new system that draws on Western
models. He wants a ``president'' to head the Soviet government _
one that is more answerable to the public and less to the Communist
Party (whose membership includes only 20 million of the country's
270 million people).
   He advocates a ``Congress of USSR People's Deputies'' that is
reflective of people's concerns. And he envisions local governments
that have powers to tax businesses to provide services. ...
   Blasting past Soviet regimes, he declared, ``The tendency to
encompass every nook of life with detailed centralized planning and
control literally strait-jacketed society.'' ...
   Like Humpty-Dumpty, Mr. Gorbachev may yet take a great fall.
Many Soviet ``conservatives'' are totally opposed to his reforms.
But if he succeeds even partially, the world should be a more
peaceful palce. Soviet citizens who can demand and get good shoes
are less likely to be thinking about fomenting revolution elsewhere.

   The Houston Post on the selection of Ann Richards as Democratic
keynote speaker:
   Democratic presidential hopeful Michael Dukakis said he wanted a
female to deliver the keynote address at the national convention.
And the party preferred someone who could appeal to Southern
voters, particularly in Texas.
   State Treasurer Ann Richards certainly meets those
qualifications. But in naming her as the keynote speaker, the
Democrats are getting more than a gender and a geographic locale.
Richards is a dedicated public servant, an accomplished orator,
and, as one Democratic official accurately described her, ``a fiery
populist.'' Her speech promises to be an old-fashioned stem-winder
and calls to mind the success of the only woman who's given the
keynote address, Texas' Barbara Jordan in 1976.

<HEAD>Ethics Investigation of Meese May Proceed Anyway</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Justice Department unit may decide to pursue
an ethics examination of Attorney General Edwin Meese III despite
the fact that he is resigning, a department spokesman acknowledged
today.
   ``The Office of Professional Responsibility may open a case
anytime it wishes for present or former department employees if
Mike Shaheen feels that it's called for,'' department spokesman
Patrick Korten said when questioned about the possibility that the
office, which is headed by Shaheen, might do so in regard to Meese.
   Korten said that ``I don't personally see what purpose it would
serve in this particular case'' to carry out such an ethics review,
``but that's entirely up to'' Shaheen.
   When pressed to explain why it would serve no purpose, Korten
said that ``the main task of OPR is to ensure the integrity and
adherence to laws and regulations by department officials,'' a
reference to the fact that Meese is leaving in late July or early
August.
   On Tuesday, department aides close to Meese, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said there would be no ethics review of the
attorney general because he is stepping down. But today, other
department sources said that such assertions are flatly incorrect
and that an ethics review of Meese was a distinct possibility.
Those sources, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said OPR
has in the past launched reviews of employees who are leaving and
followed those reviews through to a conclusion after the employees
left, and Korten subsequently acknowledged that OPR investigators
``certainly have the authority to do that.''
   Meanwhile, Meese said that any questions raised about his ethics
in a court-appointed investigator's 830-page probe of his conduct
would be just excess verbiage.
   Nonetheless, Meese said he would respond.
   Asked about reports that independent counsel James McKay's
report _ delivered in secret to a federal judge hours before Meese
resigned Tuesday _ paints an unflattering portrait of the attorney
general but does not suggest any illegal activities were committed,
Meese said:
   ``That's really immaterial because whatever may be in the report
along that line would only be commentary in his opinion. It would
have no legal force.''
   Meese, making the rounds of network television's three major
morning news programs, said McKay's only charter had been to
determine if the attorney general violated any laws.
   ``He has now found that there was ... no criminal conduct of any
sort on my part,'' Meese said. ``So anything else that might be
said is merely surplusage.''
   Asked if presenting material that suggests unethical behavior
was, in his opinion, excess verbiage, Meese replied:
   ``Certainly it is. It's not his job to go into ethical questions
or ethical issues at all.''
   Noting that McKay is expected to turn the results of his probe
over to the Justice Department for an ethics review, Meese said he
doubted that any department probe would be conducted.
   ``I know of nothing of that sort,'' he said.
   OPR had been prepared to examine possible improper conduct by
the attorney general in a review that could have resulted in a
recommendation to President Reagan that Meese be fired.
   Meese said he would respond personally to any suggestions of
unethical conduct raised by McKay's 14-month investigaton.
   McKay began his investigation after four executives of Wedtech
Corp. pleaded guilty in connection with alleged bribes paid to
public officials and began cooperating with authorities.
   Detailing his decision to leave office, Meese said he spoke to
Reagan before the president left for last month's economic summit
meeting in Canada, telling Reagan that he thought it would be in
``my best interests'' to leave the government before the
president's term expires next January.
   ``He said if it was in my best interests _ and I felt it was _
then he could understand that and he would go along with it,''
Meese said.
   Then, on Tuesday, Meese called the White House and spoke with
Reagan as he was on his way out the door. ``Again, he said that if
that was my wish, he would be agreeable.''
   Within 30 minutes or so, Meese announced his resignation at a
news conference in Sacramento, Calif.
   Asked today if he was leaving under a cloud, Meese said, ``I
don't believe there is any cloud at all.''
   Asked if he was leaving the department in the lurch, given that
a number of top-level posts are filled by recent appointees yet to
face Senate confirmation hearings, Meese said, ``Not at all.''
   He said the people in those slots, including his top deputies,
have extensive legal experience.
   The new deputy attorney general, Harold Christensen, and
criminal division chief, Edward Dennis, have been on the job for
little more than a month, while the department's No. 3 official,
Associate Attorney General Francis Keating, has been at work just
two months.
   Reagan, asked Tuesday whom he would name to succeed Meese, told
reporters, ``I have nobbody in mind.''
   Meese, asked if he had been pushed out, said, ``Nobody tried to
shove me and nobody could shove me, as a matter of fact.''
   Reagan, who has stood by Meese during the criminal investigation
and persistent calls from critics for his resignation, issued a
statement saying ``Ed Meese has served the American people loyally
and well.''
   The attorney general declined to answer when asked if his
longtime friend, E. Robert Wallach, had manipulated him. He said he
would not answer because Wallach is under indictment for alleged
racketeering in the Wedtech scandal.
   Asked if he been naive, Meese responded, ``I would hope not.''
   McKay looked into Meese's ties to scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp.,
a $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline and his meetings with regional Bell
telephone executives when he held $14,000 in phone company stock.
   The independent prosecutor also investigated an arrangement in
which members of a Washington real estate family arranged to pay a
$40,000-a-year salary for Meese's wife and then won an office lease
renewal with the Justice Department.
   Each aspect of McKay's investigation involved Meese's
relationship with Wallach, who is under indictment for alleged
racketeering in the Wedtech scandal.
   Wallach, interviewed Tuesday evening on CNN's ``Larry King
Live'' program, said McKay ``spoke to over 100 witnesses, reviewed
thousands and thousands of documents and came up without a single
scintilla of evidence of wrongdoing on Ed's part and, I submit,
therefore, on my part.''
   Meese decided to resign in part out of the realization that he
faces a new and intense round of public criticism when the report
by McKay is publicly issued in a few weeks, said Justice Department
sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   By resigning after it has become clear that he will not be
indicted but before the massive report details his activities,
Meese can declare that he has been vindicated, said the sources.
   Republicans, many of whom saw Meese as a political liability for
the coming elections, were generally pleased by his decision to
leave now. His announcement brought expressions of relief from
George Bush's presidential campaign and a terse statement from the
vice president himself.
   ``Ed did the right thing and I wish him well,'' Bush said in
remarks read over the phone by a staff member.
   Meese, 56, said he will return to private life and that ``I have
had several opportunities presented to me over the past few
months.'' He did not elaborate.
   Meese has been attorney general since Feb. 25, 1985 and before
that was White House counselor. His friendship with Reagan dates
back to their days together in California, where Reagan was
governor.

   Police on Wednesday freed three West
German television journalists detained for two days after a tribal
chief objected to their filming a traditional burial rite, a
colleague said.
   It was unclear whether they faced any charges.
   ``They phoned to say they have been released with their car,
passports and equipment and are returning to Nairobi,'' said a
spokeswoman for ARD-German Television. The spokeswoman, based in
Nairobi, spoke on condition that she not be identified.
   Correspondent Helmut Grosses, 49, of Hamburg; cameraman Thomas
Mittelstenscheld, 39, of West Berlin; and Bernd Longree, 48, of
Bonn, a television journalist traveling with them, were detained
Monday in the western town of Kisumu on Lake Victoria for filming
without a license, the colleague said.
   Kenyan law requires licenses for filming of commercial movies,
but television journalists are usually exempted.
   The crew drove to a village near Kisumu on Sunday to film a
traditional Luo tribal funeral at the invitation of relatives. A
local chief objected and they stopped filming, the colleague said.
   Police detained them and impounded their car, equipment and
passports in Kisumu the next day while they were en route back to
Nairobi, she said. They were held under a form of house arrest at a
Kisumu hotel.

<HEAD>Hodel Asks Public For Help Spotting Drugs on Federal Lands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   -
   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Interior Department launched an effort
Wednesday to enlist employees and users of its public lands as
``eyes and ears'' in a stepped-up campaign against illegal drugs.
   ``One of the biggest problems we face on federal lands is
knowing when and where drug activity occurs,'' Secretary Donald P.
Hodel said at a news conference.
   Employees of the department's land-management agencies _ the
National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of
Indian Affairs, the Bureau of Reclamation and the Fish and Wildlife
Service _ will be given increased training in spotting signs of
drug use, Hodel said.
   He used the example of a bottle cap ``which you or I might not
think anything of,'' but which might have been used to heat a small
amount of a drug solution, and ``to a trained ranger might alert
him that something was going on in the vicinity.''
   Departmental pilots may be asked to keep an eye out for
marijuana stands, he said.
   The department has sent public service commercials asking for
public alertness to drug use and transactions to 600 television
stations, and new signs will be added at parks and other
facilities, Hodel said.
   The department administers 500 million acres of land, ore than a
fifth of the nation. If the Forest Service, an Agriculture
Department office that like the Interior Department has encountered
marijuana growing on its lands, were added, the total would be
about 30 percent of the nation.
   The department's domains include tracts from parks in and near
Washington, D.C., where drugs like crack and PCP are frequently
traded, all the way to some of the most remote areas of the nation,
like vast tracts of Alaska, where drug activities are unlikely to
be a concern.
   Though the department wants park rangers to be more alert, ``I
don't read (them) as going out of their way'' to raid visitor
campsites looking for drugs, Hodel said.
   Instead, ``The rangers would be the eyes and ears'' for law
enforcement officers.
   The secretary said subordinates had developed an estimate that
the department spends $11 million a year on anti-drug activites by
its 4,300 law enforcement officers and 30 undercover agents, though
``I am always nervous about such figures.''
   He said he could offer only ``anecdotal evidence'' that drug use
and sales on the public lands were getting worse, but noted that
the National Park Service alone made 3,100 drug arrests last year
and confiscated an estimated $1 billion worth of illegal drugs,
including 110,000 marijuana plants.
   Department bureaus have been asked to give priority to drugs in
drawing up their budget requests for the 1990 fiscal year, and
Hodel said he would support increases ``If that's what it takes.''

<TEXT>
   Lawyers for the Justice Department and an
environmental group urged a federal appeals court Wednesday to
dissolve an injunction that has let Louisiana shrimpers avoid using
Turtle Excluder Devices in their nets.
   The injunction was issued by U.S. District Judge Patrick Carr in
April, just as Louisiana was getting ready to open its waters for
the spring season. Carr forbade enforcement of the federal
regulation until courts ruled on an appeal by the state attorney
general and the Concerned Shrimpers of Louisiana.
   Turtle excluders, installed where a trawl narrows down to a
pocket, provide a trap door through which turtles are ejected.
Shrimpers contend shrimp also escape through the trap door, when
the device isn't blocked by debris that prevents anything entering
the pocket.
   ``It's in the middle of the shrimp season, and you are asking us
to lift the injunction so that literally overnight they would have
to start using Turtle Excluder Devices?'' asked Judge Jerry E.
Smith, one of three judges who heard the plea in the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals.
   ``There is no surprise for them,'' responded attorney David
Hayes, representing the Center for Environmental Education. Hayes
said that with the on-again, off-again history of the federal
regulation, shrimpers have TEDs ready for installation.
   Although the turtle excluders protect all sea turtles, the main
concern is the disappearing Kemp Ridley.
   John Sheppard of the Louisiana attorney general's office argued
that the TEDs reduce the shrimp catch and do little to protect
endangered sea turtles.
   He said dredging and development of beachfront property kill far
more turtles than shrimp nets.
   ``There are all sorts of depredations on the turtle population.
Why discriminate against the shrimper?'' he said.
   The court gave no indication when it would rule.

   A vehicle packed with explosives blew
up today in a busy market near Communist Party headquarters in the
Afghan capital, and media reports said up to seven people were
killed.
   Also today, Radio Kabul said rockets blasted a residential
section of the capital and killed seven people and injured 19.
   The state-run radio said six people died in the car bombing and
16 were injured.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass reported in a dispatch from
Kabul that seven people were killed and 26 injured by the car bomb.
Tass said the blast demolished 16 stores and burned five cars. It
provided no other information on the explosion.
   Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad, said the blast rocked
Kabul's central market as people were returning from early morning
prayers. It did not provide any additional information on the
rocket attack.
   The car bomb exploded about 250 yards from the headquarters of
the governing People's Democratic Party in Kabul.
   A Western diplomatic source in Islamabad said the blast damaged
the building, which houses government executive offices,
Afghanistan's national bank, and the ministries of education,
planning, and mines and industry.
   Tass quoted the Afghan news agency Bakhtar as saying an
anti-Marxist rebel group shelled the city of Gardez, capital of
Paktia province, killing two civilians, wounding three and
destroying 22 houses.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfilyev denied reports
by Western diplomats in Pakistan that Soviet advisers had ordered
bombing of a provincial capital to keep guerrillas out.
   The diplomats said Tuesday that the Wardak provincial capital
Maidan Shahr, 15 miles southwest of Kabul, had been bombed after
guerrillas occupied the town for 24 hours late last month.
   He said rebels tried to seize the city but were repelled by the

   ``The city is under government control, and there is no
destruction in Maidan Shahr,'' he said.
   Western diplomats also said guerrillas are massing around the
city of Paghman, 20 miles from Kabul.
   ``There is a military confrontation between government troops
and rebel units but no populated locality, as of today, has been
surrendered to the rebels,'' Perfilyev said.

   Five shots were fired at a train loaded with
rush-hour commuters this morning, causing slight injuries to two
passengers, a spokesman for the regional transit agency said.
   Initial reports indicated one bullet went through a window and
another pierced the stainless steel side of the four-car
Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority train, said
SEPTA spokesman Dave Murdock. Three others bounced off the top of
the train, he said.
   ``It missed me by two inches,'' passenger Darlene Stack said of
one bullet. ``It sounded like firecrackers, but it wasn't
firecrackers, it was gunshots.''
   Clarence Savage, 61, of Dover, Del., was treated at Hahnemann
University Hospital for a scratched forehead and released. ``He was
leaning against the window when the window shattered,'' said police
Detective Gerald Whartenby.
   A second passenger apparently was hit in the arm by debris but
left the scene without seeking medical treatment, SEPTA spokesman
Jim Whitaker said.
   ``At the time of the incident, I understand they were
questioning two homeless people who lived in the area. At this
time, I understand there was no reason to believe they were
involved,'' said police Sgt. Anthony Boyle.
   The sniping occurred at 7:38 a.m. as the train approached
Suburban Station in the city's central business district, Murdock
said. There were about 200 people on the train, which had stopped
at 30th Street Station a few minutes earlier and let off half the
estimated 400 passengers, Whitaker said.
   The shots apparently were fired from overhead as the train
traveled through a culvert-type right of way, Murdock said.

<HEAD>State's Largest Newspapers On Trial For Revealing Source</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Minnesota's two largest newspapers are on
trial for revealing the identity of a man who leaked court
documents in 1982 about the 12-year-old shoplifting conviction of a
candidate for lieutenant governor.
   In his opening statement Tuesday, an attorney for Dan Cohen said
he would put the day-to-day decision-making at the Minneapolis Star
and Tribune and the St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch on trial before
a jury.
   Cohen is ``being punished for revealing factual information
about a powerful political candidate,'' said attorney Elliot
Rothenberg. ``All he did was turn over authentic court records.''
   Attorneys for the newspapers were scheduled to make their
opening statements Wednesday in Hennepin County District Court.
   Cohen, in his breach-of-contract lawsuit, claims the newspapers
violated agreements not to identify him as the source of
information about Marlene Johnson's record for shoplifting $6 worth
of merchandise.
   Johnson was the DFL candidate for lieutenant governor on a
ticket led by Rudy Perpich. She and Perpich won the 1982 election
and have held the offices since 1983.
   On Oct. 27, 1982, reporters Lori Sturdevant of the Minneapolis
newspaper and Bill Salisbury of the St. Paul newspaper separately
accepted court documents from Cohen about the 1970 shoplifing
conviction _ which was vacated in 1971 with no sentence _ on
condition that Cohen's identity would not be revealed.
   Later that day, editors of both newspapers overruled their
reporters and decided to name Cohen as the source. Two other news
organizations _ The Associated Press and WCCO-TV _ received the
same information from Cohen but did not identify him.
   The day the stories appeared, Cohen was fired from his
$35,000-a-year job as a public relations executive with an
advertising agency, Rothenberg said.
   Editors at both papers have said Cohen's name was revealed
because the importance of keeping readers fully informed of
election developments outweighed continuing his confidentiality.
Attorneys for the papers have argued that the newspapers did not
have a viable oral contract with Cohen.
   The Minneapolis newspaper has since changed its name to the Star
Tribune.
   Rothenberg said Cohen was a good friend of
Independent-Republican gubernatorial candidate Wheelock Whitney who
had helped write position papers in his official capacity at the
advertising agency.
   The trial is expected to last two weeks.

   Applications from thousands of illegal aliens
who filed for amnesty with the help of social agencies have been
delivered to federal officials to meet the second of three amnesty
deadlines.
   Officials of the Immigration and Naturalization Service's
Western Region offices said Tuesday they expected to receive a
total of about 7,000 applications.
   The deadline applied to aliens who applied for amnesty through
charitable organizations, social service agencies and other groups
designated by the INS.
   Under a federal law that took effect in 1986, illegal aliens who
entered the country before Jan. 1, 1982, could file for temporary
citizenship and qualify for permanent residency within 2{ years.
   The first deadline was May 4. Illegal aliens working through
agencies received an extra 60 days. The third deadline of Nov. 30
applies to agricultural workers.

<TEXT>
   A black family that moved into a
predominantly white subdivision two weeks ago is preparing for
another move after a cross was burned in its front yard.
   ``This is something out of the pages of the Old South,'' said
Willie Carter, a retired Air Force staff sergeant.
   Carter said he threw the remnants of a charred cross and its
sawhorse base into a drainage ditch before going to church Sunday
morning.
   ``I'm not a violent person, but when I saw the cross, I felt
upset... . I wanted to know who did it, so I could choke him,
although I'm not that type of person,'' Carter said Tuesday.
   Carter said his family will move as soon as their real estate
agent finds a comparable home.
   ``We just want a nice place to live,'' said Carter's wife, Elsie
Carter. ``I have small children and we just don't have time for
this.''
   Police in Belleville, about 10 miles southeast of St. Louis,
said Tuesday that officers were dispatched to the Carters' home
Monday night but would not release any more information.
   Carter said he did not call police until Monday evening, after
the family returned from spending the holiday with relatives. He
didn't call Sunday morning, he said, because the family was late to
church.
   Neighbors said the Carters seemed to be a nice family but they
had little chance to get to know them.
   ``Nothing like this has ever happened,'' said Lisa Molitor, who
said her son, Greg, 5, sometimes played with one of Carter children.
   ``I think this is terrible,'' said Aurile Johnson, another
neighbor. ``If I would have seen the cross burning, I would have
called the police. We're scared. What's next, shooting?''

<HEAD>Hundreds of Haitians Show Up For Federal Permit Hearing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Haitians gathered at a federal
courthouse today as a judge opened a hearing on the fate of 14,000
farm laborers facing expulsion from the United States because they
lack work permits.
   Senior U.S. District Judge C. Clyde Atkins ordered the hearing
moved to a larger courtroom to accommodate the crowd.
   A request for an injunction against the Immigration and
Naturalization Service was filed by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese
of Palm Beach, the Haitian Refugee Center and individual
farmworkers.
   The case directly affects an estimated 14,000 Haitians, Mexicans
and other foreign workers in Florida, Alabama and Georgia,
attorneys in the case said, and could apply across the country.
   At issue is the INS' refusal to accept affidavits from the
farmworkers and their employers swearing they have worked the 90
hours required to receive a special agricultural work permit under
the new immigration law.
   Without the permits, they cannot legally remain in the United
States, and many are already under expulsion orders.
   Ira Kurzban, attorney for the farmworkers, said the INS is
defying Congress' wishes by demanding documentary proof of
employment which farmworkers do not have because many had been in
the country illegally.
   ``The government has imposed an impossible burden of proof,''
said the complaint. Kurzban said the burden of proof should be on
the INS to disprove the affidavits.
   The INS has also held hearings on the permits without
translators present, Kurzban said, and is not granting required
temporary work permits during the appeal process.
   INS attorney David Bernal said the rigorous proof is necessary
to support the affidavits because ``it has been determined there
was fraud in this area.''
   Bernal told Atkins that the burden of providing a translator was
not the government's responsibility, and that most farmworkers
brought someone with them to the INS hearings in any case.
   The INS also argued that the district court had no jurisdiction
because Congress specifically said only federal appeals courts
could hear challenges to the law, but Kurzban said the suit is
challenging only INS procedures, not the law itself.

<TEXT>
   The Oregon National Guard has inquired
into the possibility of converting the former commune of Indian
guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh into a training facility.
   Col. Gary Lockwood, executive officer for the state's Military
Department, said the Guard must study the 64,000-acre Rancho
Rajneesh before it is considered for any military use.
   ``Any discussion we would have is academic,'' Lockwood said
earlier this week. ``We're not in a position to be looking at the
financing and purchase.''
   But the Guard's interest in the site could change if the
property should come into public ownership, he said.
   The central Oregon ranch is for sale for $28 million.
   Meanwhile, Lawrence B. Rew, a Pendleton attorney representing
Connecticut General Life Insurance Co., said the company expects a
summary judgment in Wasco County Circuit Court on a request for
foreclosure against the ranch. The insurance company holds the
principal mortgage on the property.
   If the judgment is granted, Rew said, the foreclosure action
would proceed to a sheriff's sale. If the motion is denied, the
matter would be set for trial, he said.
   The ranch served as a commune and world headquarters for
Rajneesh and his followers for 4{ years. The commune disbanded in
1985 after criminal charges were filed against the sect's top
leaders and the guru was ordered to leave the country.
   Connecticut General is trying to recover $3.76 million through
its foreclosure lawsuit, including more than $828,000 in accrued
interest on the property.
   The company's lawsuit says no payments on the property have been
made since Aug. 1, 1986.
   The lawsuit asks that the ranch be sold as a single parcel by
the Wasco County sheriff, with the proceeds used to pay first the
foreclosure judgment, then other lienholders.
   This week, Wasco County Circuit Judge John Kelly signed an order
declaring several of the defendants in the foreclosure suit to be
in default because they had not responded to defend their interests
in the property.

   A full-time fire chief and his
25-member volunteer force have been fired by township trustees,
climaxing a dispute over working conditions and other demands.
   The Wayne Township trustees surprised spectators and
firefighters at a public meeting Tuesday night by announcing the
mass firings. In addition to Fire Chief Charles Nause, the only
full-time, paid department member, about 25 volunteer firefighters
and emergency medical technicians were discharged.
   The volunteers had walked off the job briefly more than a month
ago and expected the trustees to announce a settlement of the
dispute at the meeting.
   Patricia Pack, a spokeswoman for the firefighters who was among
those fired, said Wednesday the trustees are gambling with the
township's 5,000 residents. The firefighters, she said, plan to
challenge the firings.
   ``We will get a lawyer,'' said Ms. Pack, an emergency medical
technician. ``I'm a little shocked. It seems to me the trustees of
Wayne Township are playing Russian roulette with the lives of the
people of the township.''
   The trustees said Clermont County and surrounding towns would
provide emergency services in the meantime.
   The firefighters comprise a corporation that contracts with the
township to provide emergency services, in return for insurance and
workmen's compensation coverage. No contract had been agreed to
this year.
   The trustees, who own the firefighters' equipment and emergency
services building, forbade the firefighters to return to the
building or remove personal belongings, Ms. Pack said.
   The township is located 20 miles east of Cincinnati.
   The trustees said in a letter that the firefighters were fired
because of unreasonable demands and failure to get along with the
trustees. They gave no reason for firing Nause, Ms. Pack said.
   The firefighters had demanded a full-time paid chief, insurance
coverage for supervising emergency medical technicians and a new
emergency vehicle to replace an old, deteriorating one.
   The firefighters returned to work after Nause was restored to a
full-time chief. He had been cut to part-time status last January.

   A holiday duplex fire that killed a couple
and their three children has been ruled arson, Fire Chief Charles
J. Bunyan said Wednesday.
   No suspect has been identified in Monday's fire, but Bunyan
said, ``We have eliminated any accidental cause of the fire and we
are now treating the fire as incendiary.''
   He said investigators had traced the origin of the fire to the
enclosed porch of the east duplex destroyed in the fire.
   The victims were Jack Blose, 35; his wife, Deborah, 31; their
12-year-old son, Jack Jr.; 5-year-old daughter, Rachel; and
4-year-old daughter, Lacey.
   Karen Campbell, who lived in the other half of the duplex, was
out of town and returned to find the building in ruins.
   Bunyan said investigators had interviewed both Mrs. Campbell and
the landlord, Herbert Klebaum Jr.

   A woman who dressed her 7-year-old son as
a pig and tied him to a bench in the front yard where neighbors
could view the crying child pleaded innocent today to a child abuse
charge.
   According to police, Mary Francis Bergamasco, 29, said she
wanted her son to understand ``for if only 30 minutes that lying
and stealing make you ugly like Pinocchio.''
   It may have been wrong, she said, but ``Mom said it worked on us
kids.''
   However, police said her actions constituted child abuse.
   At her arraignment in San Leandro-Hayward Municipal Court,
Bergamasco pleaded innocent to the misdemeanor child abuse charge.
She was ordered by Judge John Burke to appear July 18 for a
preliminary hearing before Judge Robert Fairwell.
   ``This is a first for me,'' said Sgt. Craig Hoyer, a child abuse
investigator for the Hayward Police Department. ``This was public
humiliation. I mean, when your peers see you like that, in my mind,
it could almost destroy a kid's psyche.''
   The boy's hands were tied behind his back, his face was painted
blue and a cardboard pig nose made from an egg carton was taped to
his head.
   About 15 neighbors gathered as the boy sat for 30 minutes with a
sign on his chest reading, ``I'm a dumb pig.''
   ``Ugly is what you will become every time you lie and steal.
Look at me squeal. My hands are tied because I cannot be trusted.
This is a lesson to be learned. Look. Laugh. Thief. Stealing. Bad
boy,'' the sign read.
   When she was arrested June 28, her son and 1-year-old daughter
were taken into protective custody and placed in separate foster
homes
   The punishment was intended to teach the boy a lesson after two
weeks of thievery during which he stole $25 worth of baseball
cards, $6 cash, an earring, a belt buckle and another child's toy,
police quoted Bergamasco as saying.
   After each theft, the boy lied about what he had done, she said.
   Bergamasco's own mother used the discipline technique and also
placed Bergamasco's hands on hot stove burners for punishment, she
told police in a six-page written statement.
   According to court records, Union City police investigated
Bergamasco on a report of child abandonment in March. Two warrants
were issued for her arrest after she failed to make court
appearances for her February offenses.
   In the latest incident, police arrived at her house to find the
boy, crying, on the porch. A 28-inch piece of nylon rope was tied
around his wrists in a secure knot.
   ``I love all my children and really try to stress a good and
healthy surrounding. Also, to tell the truth no matter how bad,''
Bergamasco said.

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis has a passion for order, but
choosing a vice presidential candidate is proving anything but an
orderly process he can carry out with a minimum of public scrutiny.
   Not until he clinched the Democratic presidential nomination on
June 7 would Dukakis even discuss the process by which he would
choose a running mate and then it was only to say it would be ``a
good, thoughtful, deliberative process.''
   But with interviews in Boston on Tuesday and Wednesday of three
prospective running mates, the Dukakis search began to resemble the
parade to North Oaks, Minn., four years ago when Walter F. Mondale
was looking for someone to complete the Democratic ticket.
   Looking back on his experience, Mondale conceded that ``I don't
think it built confidence.''
   The 1984 Democratic nominee suggested that Dukakis ``pursue a
different way of looking at vice presidential candidates.'' And
Dukakis started out determined to take Mondale's advice. Campaign
aides were forbidden to talk about the process.
   Dukakis did avoid the biggest Mondale mistake _ his
determination to make it clear he was considering women as well as
men, blacks as well as whites. The Mondale list included three
women, among them the final choice, Rep. Geraldine Ferraro of New
York, two blacks and a Hispanic and one white male.
   While it was, as Mondale would say ``not a bad idea,'' it
reinforced the perception that he was too eager to cater to various
special interest groups.
   Ironically, Mondale's history-making choice all but guaranteed
that the Democratic vice presidential candidate this year would be
a white male.
   ``I'm going to cast my net far and wide,'' said the
Massachusetts governor. ``Nobody's ruled in, nobody's ruled out,''
was a favorite response to questions about whether this or that
individual was under consideration.
   The first major leak was that Dukakis had all but settled on
Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey for the No. 2 spot on the ticket.
   Dukakis quashed that report with a statement saying that only he
and confidant Paul Brountas, the lawyer in charge of the search,
could speak with any authority about who might be in or out of
contention.
   But if Dukakis seriously believed he could control the
information about how he was going about choosing a running mate,
he underestimated the intensity of the scrutiny it would undergo as
well as the impossibility of muzzling Jesse Jackson.
   The first indication of who were the serious contenders for the
No. 2 spot came when Brountas began asking individuals for detailed
personal and financial information.
   Inevitably, names began to come out. Among the first were Sens.
Bob Graham of Florida and John Glenn of Ohio.
   The Dukakis campaign must have known that those names would come
out.
   Less predictable and more embarrassing was that at the same time
there were leaks of the names of prospects who had turned him down
_ Bradley and Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia and House Majority Leader
Tom Foley of Washington.
   When Dukakis visited the Capitol last week for a day of meetings
with members of Congress, he eluded reporters most of the day but
then told them he had met individually with Graham, Glenn, Nunn and
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas. Nunn later said he had told the
governor he was not interested.
   But those amounted to the first of the interviews.
   Traveling to Boston this week were Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of
Tennessee and Reps. Richard Gephardt of Missouri and Lee Hamilton
of Indiana. Gephardt and Hamilton told reporters they would happily
accept an offer to run with Dukakis. Gore ducked all questions.
   The entire process has been played out to background music
provided by Jackson who has insisted he deserves consideration for
the vice presidential nomination.
   He called the other contenders ``unknown quantities'' and
suggested that his qualifications were far more impressive.
   At the same time, Jackson wouldn't say if he'd accept the job if
offered. At one point he said he'd made up his mind but had told no
one, including Dukakis of his decision.

   A car loaded with explosives blew up
in a busy market near Communist Party headquarters in the Afghan
capital of Kabul on Wednesday. Reports said up to seven people were
killed and 26 injured.
   The blast damaged the party building, which houses government
executive offices, Afghanistan's national bank, and the ministries
of education, planning and mines and industry, a Western diplomatic
source said.
   Radio Kabul said six people died and 16 were injured. The blast
rocked the city's central market as people were returning from
early morning Moslem prayers, the state-run radio reported.
   The Soviet news agency Tass reported from Kabul that seven
people were killed and 26 injured in the explosion. The car bombing
demolished 16 stores and burned five cars, Tass said.
   Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad, also said rockets blasted a
residential section of the capital, killing seven people and
injuring 19. No other details were given.
   The car bomb exploded about 250 yards from the Central Committee
building of the ruling People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan.
Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
site of the explosion clearly indicated it was directed at party
and government offices.
   Tass also quoted the Afghan news agency Bakhtar as saying an
anti-Marxist guerrilla group shelled the city of Gardez, capital of
Paktia province, killing two civilians, wounding three and
destroying 22 houses.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfilyev denied reports
by Western diplomats in Pakistan that Soviet advisers had ordered
bombing of a provincial capital to keep guerrillas out.
   The diplomats said Tuesday the Wardak provincial capital Maidan
Shahr, 15 miles southwest of Kabul, had been bombed after
guerrillas occupied the town for 24 hours last month.
   He said guerrillas tried to seize the city but were repulsed by
the Afghan army.
   ``The city is under government control, and there is no
destruction in Maidan Shahr,'' he said.
   Western diplomats also said guerrillas are massing around the
city of Paghman, 20 miles from Kabul.
   ``There is a military confrontation between government troops
and rebel units but no populated locality, as of today, has been
surrendered to the rebels,'' Perfilyev said.
   Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, leader of an Afghan guerrilla group, told
reporters the guerrillas are building strength around Kabul, and
the resistance will move on the capital ``in the very near future.''
   The Soviet Union, which sent troops into Afghanistan in December
1979, has begun withdrawing them from the country. Under an
agreement signed in Geneva in April, the Soviets agreed to have
half their estimated 115,000 soldiers out by Aug. 15 and the rest
by Feb. 15.
   The Soviets entered Afghanistan to prop up a Marxist government
and help it fight the Islamic guerrillas.
   The guerrillas have not agreed to stop fighting the government
of President Najib.

   Superman can bend steel in his bare
hands, but getting into a car with the keys locked inside is
another matter.
   Actor Christopher Reeve, who portrays the superhero in the
Superman movies, and some friends left their rented car at a
boatyard and discovered the keys still in the ignition when they
returned on Monday.
   They called police, and Special Officer Art Stone came to the
rescue with tools to unlock the car.
   Stone, an auto repairman who was helping out with the town's
Fourth of July celebration, got the actor's autograph before he
left.
   ``I told him my wife wouldn't believe I did the thing,'' Stone
said. ``He said, `Got a piece of paper?'''

   Arlene Francis says she was so shaken when a
thief snatched her trademark diamond heart-shaped necklace from her
neck that she couldn't even cry out for help.
   The 79-year-old radio and television personality said she was
walking down a midtown Manhattan avenue Tuesday when a man grabbed
the heart, breaking the chain, before he fled.
   ``I was so startled, I couldn't even yell, `Stop thief,''' she
said.
   Ms. Francis had worn the necklace for more than 40 years. The
heart pendant was a gift from her late husband Martin Gabel on
their first anniversary.
   She said the heart was ``very valuable'' but also had
sentimental value.
   ``He's gone, and now it, too, is gone,'' she said.
   Ms. Francis, best known for her quarter-century stint as a
panelist on the TV game show ``What's My Line?'' said she never
took the necklace off.
   Her attachment to the piece was noticed by television viewers
and jewelry designers, triggering a diamond heart fad in the
mid-1950s.

   Actor James Garner won't be pushing beef
anymore. An actress, a model and two basketball stars will replace
him as celebrity representatives for the Beef Industry Council.
   Garner's 18-month contract ended June 30, said David Ivan,
spokesman for the National Cattlemen's Association.
   ``We were happy working with Jim Garner, and he did a very fine
job for us,'' Ivan said. ``We understand he has signed an exclusive
contract to do Mazda (automobile) ads.''
   The new representatives are actress Lauren Bacall, model Kim
Alexis, the Boston Celtics' Larry Bird and the Los Angeles Lakers'
Michael Cooper.
   Bird and Cooper each signed $100,000 contracts to be included in
the council's new television and print campaign beginning in
September, Ivan said. Fees for Miss Bacall and Miss Alexis were not
disclosed.
   The Beef Industry Council handles the national beef campaign on
behalf of the Beef Board. Both are based in Chicago. To pay for the
promotional program, beef producers make a mandatory $1-per-head
checkoff contribution at the point of sale.

<HEAD>Town Deletes Religious Group From Tax Credits List</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WESTPORT, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A religious group which helps youngsters
with drug problems should not receive state financial aid because
it limits membership to those who accept Jesus Christ, a town
meeting has decided.
   The meeting voted 20-5 Tuesday night to delete Connecticut Youth
for Christ from a list of 24 municipally approved, non-profit
agencies eligible for donations under the state's Neighborhood
Assistance Act.
   ``The organization should be of service to the entire community
as a whole because that is the purpose of the act. With this one,
those who do not accept Jesus Christ do not qualify,'' said Penny
Lind, chairwoman of the meeting's social services committee.
   The list will be sent to the state Department of Revenue
Services, which will determine whether the organization should be
included in a master list to be mailed to Connecticut businesses
and corporations. A contribution to any of these organizations
brings 50 percent to 60 percent credits on the Connecticut
corporate business tax.
   Lind said $3 million in tax credits are available statewide this
year.
   Stephen J. Hall, executive director of Youth for Christ, said
the town of Thomastown has submitted the name of the group on its
state list for the last two years. The action by Westport would
penalize the group, he said.

<TEXT>
   A ship carrying more than 70 tons of
well-packaged marijuana arrived in port today after being seized on
the high seas by a Coast Guard cutter for not flying a flag and
refusing orders to stop.
   The Coast Guard cutter Boutwell, sporting a makeshift flag
showing a marijuana leaf with a red line diagonally across it,
towed the Panamanian-registered Encounter Bay to a Seattle pier.
   ``Our best estimate is there is somewhere in excess of 72 tons''
of marijuana on board, said the Boutwell's captain, Cecil Allison.
He described the drug as ``very high grade with very few stems and
very few seeds.''
   Allison said the marijuana, with a street value estimated at
about $280 million, consisted of about 8,000 bales packed in four
large shipping containers. Each bale, in a blue nylon sack,
contained eight packets of marijuana vacuum-sealed in double
plastic wrappings.
   ``You would like to get some of your freeze-dried food packed
this well,'' the captain said.
   The marijuana vessel, a 180-foot converted offshore oil rig
supply ship, was under tight security as agents of the U.S. Drug
Enforcment Administration secured the ship's cargo and the
18-member crew.
   Crew members were being fingerprinted aboard the Boutwell before
a scheduled appearance before a U.S. magistrate this afternoon.
   Thirteen of the crew were from Indonesia, Thailand and
Singapore. The other five included three from the United States and
one each from Britain and New Zealand, the Coast Guard said.
   The crew members were cooperative, but all refused to talk about
the drug shipment, Allison said.
   If it can be proved the ship was bound for the United States,
they could face felony charges of a few years to life in prison,
depending on prior convictions and sentencing guidelines, said Gary
Liming, special agent-in-charge of the Drug Enforcement
Administration in Seattle.
   The owner of the Encounter Bay was listed as Countess Shipping
Corp. of Panama.
   Liming said the pot was probably from the Far East, possibly
Thailand, with California the eventual destination.
   With an estimated street value of $2,000 per pound, the
marijuana is worth about $280 million, making it one of the largest
drug seizures in maritime history and the biggest on the West
Coast, said Coast Guard Lt. Eldo DeLong.
   Sixty rounds were fired from a .50-caliber machine gun aboard
the 378-foot Boutwell into the Encounter Bay's engine room after
the vessel refused to stop.
   Permission to board the ship was obtained from the Panamanian
embassy after suspicions were raised when it was spotted in
international waters off the central Washington coast from a Coast
Guard C-130 aircraft, DeLong said.
   ``It wasn't flying a flag, the name and home port weren't
readily visible, and it's kind of unusual to see this type of
vessel in this area,'' he explained.
   Authorities had no idea about the vessel's cargo before
boarding, he said.

<TEXT>
   THE PRESIDENCY _ Four men and one woman are running for a
single, six-year term that begins Dec. 1. The three major
candidates are Carlos Salinas de Gortari of the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI; Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas of the leftist National Democratic Front coalition; and
Manuel J. Clouthier of the conservative National Action Party. Also
running are Rosario Ibarra de Piedra of the radical Revolutionary
Workers Party and Gumersindo Magana Negrete of the tiny Mexican
Democratic Party.

   THE SENATE _ Voters elect 64 senators, two from each of Mexico's
31 states and two from the federal district. Like presidents,
senators serve six years and cannot be re-elected. Mexico has had
only one opposition senator under PRI rule.

<HEAD>Sharon Edges Out Arens In Herut Elections For Knesset Slate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HERZLIYA, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delegates of the right-wing Herut Party
chose top candidates Wednesday for November's election, and former
Defense Minister Ariel Sharon edged out a rival backed by Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   A dozen riot police guarded the convention at this seaside
resort, apparently to prevent clashes among Herut's three camps
headed by Sharon, Cabinet Minister Moshe Arens and Deputy Prime
Minister David Levy. A convention two years ago was aborted after
fistfights between party members.
   More than 2,000 party delegates chose among 35 candidates for
the second through eighth slots on the party slate. First place is
reserved for Shamir, leader of Herut, the senior partner in the
Likud bloc.
   Likud and its main rival, the left-of-center Labor Party, are
running neck-and-neck in polls.
   To prevent fighting among the three camps, Shamir recommended
Levy for second place, Arens for third and Sharon for fourth. Arens
is a Shamir ally, while Sharon and Levy have sought to wrest party
leadership from Shamir.
   The delegates gave Levy the second spot, but Sharon came in
third ahead of Arens, a former ambassador to the United States.
   Shamir denied the results were a personal setback. ``There was
no disloyalty by anyone,'' he told Israel army radio. He also noted
that placement on the slate would not affect candidates' future
Cabinet posts.
   Arens said the vote ``went against our agreement,'' noting that
he voted according to Shamir's recommendations. But Arens told
reporters he was ``not bitter.''
   Sharon, who is trade and industry minister, played down the
importance of the results. ``These are not votes that will
determine the future leader of the party,'' he told Israel
television. ``There is no reason to create unnecessary tension.''
   Levy, who made his political fortune as an advocate of the once
underprivileged North African-born Israelis, was thronged by
supporters who showered him with kisses.
   He criticized Shamir for trying to influence the vote, saying:
``I'm sorry the prime minister saw the need to make
recommendations.''
   The delegates also gave top slots to two newcomers to party
politics, former U.N. Ambassador Binyamin Netanyahu and former
Prime Minister Menachem Begin's son, Benjamin. Netanyahu came in
sixth and Begin was ranked eighth.
   The poolside convention was held in a carnival-like atmosphere.
   The rank-and-file showered voting delegates with buttons and
stickers bearing the names of candidates. North African-style music
blasted from an open-sided tent staked by Levy backers. Sharon
supporters walking by the pool shouted slogans through megaphones.
   The balloting was part of a complicated selection process to put
together a slate for the parliamentary elections.
   Israeli voters choose a party, not individual candidates, and
each party is apportioned Parliament seats according to the number
of votes it wins.
   Last week, Herut chose 35 candidates, and in Wednesday's vote,
those candidates were ranked. Based on 1984 election results, the
top 30 candidates have a realistic chance of winning a seat.
   Two more rounds of voting were to follow to determine slots nine
through 22.
   The remaining candidates will be ranked according to the number
of votes they got in last week's balloting.
   The Liberal Party, the junior partner in Likud, has already
selected its 12 parliamentary candidates who, according to an
agreement with Herut, will be given roughly every third slot on the
Likud list.

   Republican Sen. Arlen Specter invaded Michael
Dukakis' home turf Wednesday to criticize the likely Democratic
presidential nominee's record on crime, but Specter was in turn
ambushed by Dukakis allies.
   The Pennsylvania senator, appearing at the Massachusetts
Statehouse at the request of likely Republican nominee George Bush,
arrived to find Dukakis supporters including the state's current
and former attorneys general, several county prosecutors and police
chiefs, and state officials involved in anti-crime and anti-drug
programs.
   Also, Specter didn't travel up from Washington alone. Democratic
Sen. John F. Kerry, who also served under Dukakis as lieutenant
governor, took the same flight to Boston so he could be on hand to
defend Dukakis.
   Specter's main target was Dukakis' support of a state program
that allowed inmates sentenced to life in prison without parole to
be released on furloughs.
   One such inmate raped a Maryland woman, leading to tighter
eligibility standards that Dukakis originally opposed but later
signed into law after they were given overwhelming approval by the
Legislature.
   Bush has made the Maryland incident a staple in his pitch to
portray Dukakis as soft on crime, and Specter was here to continue
that effort, saying Dukakis' support for giving furloughs to
no-parole inmates ``raises a question as to his overall judgment.''
   Kerry, standing close by, would have none of that.
   He moved up to the microphone, exchanged pleasantries with
Specter and proceeded to denounce Bush as a do-nothing vice
president who failed as the leader of Reagan administration
anti-drug efforts.
   ``Cocaine is more readily available on the streets of America
today than at any time in history,'' Kerry told reporters. ``This
nation does not need a silent leader in the war on drugs and the
fight against crime,'' Kerry said to cheers from partisan onlookers.
   Kerry then defended the Massachusetts furlough program, saying
its eligibility standards were stricter than many state programs
and the federal prison system.
   It was Specter's turn to steal back the microphone that was
supposed to be his to begin with.
   ``Governor Dukakis' furlough system is indefensible,'' he said.
   Kerry said, ``The furlough program in Massachusetts is tougher
than the federal program.''
   He also contended Specter's appearance was designed to draw
attention from the resignation of embattled Attorney General Edwin
Meese III and called it ``an effort to obfuscate, to try to hide
this administration's failures in law enforcement.''
   Specter kept his cool though visibly annoyed that the Dukakis
allies had imposed on his show.
   State Attorney General James Shannon introduced Specter but also
made sure to refer to the declining crime rate in Massachusetts.
When Shannon, a Democrat, had gone on long enough for Specter, the
senator tried to pry away the microphone and a Specter aide reached
out for Shannon.
   ``That's not necessary,'' Specter told the aide before turning
to Shannon. ``But this is my news conference.''

<HEAD>Complaint Charges INS With Denying 14,000 Work Permits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hearing on the fate of 14,000 farmworkers facing
expulsion from the United States opened Wednesday with a farm owner
saying the government acted arbitrarily in granting work permits to
Haitians and other foreigners.
   Martha Taylor, a cherry tomato and pepper farmer from Hendry
County, said she employs 80 to 120 mostly Mexican farmworkers, and
at one point provided affidavits for some of them.
   ``Of 18 workers during that particular period, 11 got their
green cards and there were seven denials,'' Mrs. Taylor said. ``All
had the same proof.''
   Mrs. Taylor testified before Senior U.S. District Judge C. Clyde
Atkins, who moved the hearing to a larger courtroom to accommodate
hundreds of Haitians who gathered peacefully outside the courthouse.
   The suit filed by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Palm Beach
County, the Haitian Refugee Center and individual migrant workers
accuses immigration authorities of improperly refusing agricultural
work permits to foreigners.
   Without the permits, which can be granted only to laborers who
worked at least 90 hours in the fields within a certain period,
they can be expelled from the country.
   The case directly affects an estimated 14,000 Haitians, Mexicans
and other foreign workers in Florida, Alabama and Georgia,
attorneys in the case say, and could apply across the country.
   Attorneys for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
say they have refused to issue permits on the basis of sworn
affidavits alone because the program is rife with fraud.
   However, Ira Kurzban, an attorney for the laborers, argued that
the INS stand violates Congress' intentions in passing the new
immigration law.
   Kurzban said the INS is requiring documentary evidence such as
pay stubs or employment records even though Congress stated
affidavits would be sufficient.
   ``The government has imposed an impossible burden of proof,'' on
the farm workers, many of whom were paid without tax deductions, he
said.
   Garry Leffert, an attorney from Martinsburg, W.Va., who has
represented many farm workers, testified that crew chiefs often
failed to keep records of payments.
   Along with the refusal to accept the affidavits, the suit
charges that the INS has held hearings on the permits without
translators present, and is not granting required temporary work
permits during the appeal process.
   The hearing was adjourned until Thursday.

<TEXT>
   The shooting down of an Iranian airliner
by the U.S. Navy appears to help radicals in the Tehran power
struggle, but some major players are preaching moderation and
diplomacy.
   Threats of total war and worldwide terrorism have issued from
Iran since the American cruiser Vincennes shot the jetliner down
Sunday just after a skirmish with Iranian attack boats, killing all
290 people aboard.
   In contrast, however, Hashemi Rafsanjani seems to be more
interested in turning the tragedy to political advantage.
Rafsanjani, the parliament speaker and military commander, is
believed to be second in power to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the
87-year-old revolutionary patriarch.
   Clear differences about how Iran should react to the destruction
of Iran Air Flight 655 have emerged in public comments by various
Iranian leaders.
   They reflect the political turbulence in Iran since radical
gains in the April-May parliamentary elections and several
battlefield victories by Iraq, with which the Iranians have been at
war since September 1980.
   Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, designated successor to
Khomeini, urged the patriarch to activate ``revolutionary cells,
inside and outside Iran, to ... strike at America'a financial,
military and political targets everywhere.''
   Khomeini, who periodically is rumored to be near death, called
for all-out war against the Americans, offering his ``worthless
life'' to the struggle.
   Rafsanjani, who has begun advocating an end to Iran's isolation,
said ``we cannot allow ourselves to refrain from taking revenge,''
but seemed to suggest violent reprisals would be self-defeating
with this added comment:
   ``Perhaps the Americans would like it if some amateurish action
were taken in some corner of the world so that once again they can
remove the wave of propaganda which is now heaped on America's head
and divert it in another direction.''
   He said the United States ``cannot be forgiven'' even if the
airliner was shot down by mistake, as the Americans say, and
declared: ``We are sure that the world will take a serious decision
with regard to this incident.''
   All quarters in Iran demand withdrawal of U.S. naval forces in
the gulf, which they view as forming a second front in their war
with Iraq.
   It is not always easy to discern maneuvers in the opaque Iranian
political arena, but Rafsanjani suddently has become the champion
of bringing Iran back into the world.
   in a surprisingly frank interview on Iran's state-run television
last Saturday, he admitted Iran's revolutionary fervor had
alienated many countries and said:
   ``One of the wrong things we did, in the revolutionary
atmosphere, was constantly to make enemies. We pushed those who
have could been neutral into hostility. It is part of the new plan
that, in foreign policy, we should behave so as to avoid needlessly
ceding ground to the enemy.''
   On the surface, the ``wave of rage'' President Ali Khamenei
reported in Iran has bolstered such anti-Western leaders as
Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, a middle-ranking cleric
with close ties to Shiite Moslem extremists in Lebanon.
   Western intelligence sources say Mohtashemi controlled the
Islamic zealots behind the 1983 suicide bombings in Beirut that
killed hundreds of American and French servicemen. While ambassador
to Syria in 1985, he lost an eye and two fingers on his right hand
when he opened a parcel bomb in Damascus.
   Mohtashemi publicly called Rafsanjani's efforts defeatist,
prompting President Khamenei to say Iranian leaders should not
``create confusion.''
   Rafsanjani has broached the possibility of ``a non-military
solution'' to the war that would involve Iraq ``accepting justice''
and admitting it started the conflict with an invasion in September
1980. The invasion followed several border skirmishes.
   ``We have left open a non-military solution,'' he said last
month after Khomeini made him military commander-in-chief to
rebuild an effective fighting machine from Iran's demoralized
forces. ``We do not insist on the military option, but we are
pessimistic about the non-military one.''
   Some analysts suspect Rafsanjani seeks a few military victories
so face-saving settlement of the war will be possible.

<HEAD>China Considers Rating Movies Unfit For Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The increasing frankness of Chinese filmmakers in
showing sex and violence has led the government to consider rating
movies unsuitable for children, an official report said Wednesday.
   The China Youth News quoted Film Bureau chief Teng Jinxian as
saying some modern movies contain scenes that are unhealthy for
children but vital to the plot or development of character.
   One example is ``Red Sorghum,'' which shared 1988 best-picture
honors in China's Golden Rooster Awards announced Tuesday. The
story includes a rape, although it is not shown explicitly, and
shows a man being skinned to death at the order of Japanese
soldiers during World War II.
   Rather than cut the scenes, Teng said, the bureau may label the
movie unsuitable for children. He did not say if theaters would be

   Only in recent years have Chinese films contained strong sexual
elements. The strong streak of puritanism in China's Communist
rulers long required all movies to show only wholesome characters
loyally serving the nation.

<TEXT>
   It's not what you say but how big you say
it, Spotswood officials told a church group that put up an
anti-abortion billboard.
   But a church attorney looked at the billboard another way, and a
judge agreed.
   Superior Court Judge John C. Bachman issued a temporary
restraining order Tuesday, forbidding the borough from acting
against Immaculate Conception Church or the sign. He set a Sept. 6
hearing on the matter.
   The Knights of Columbus Council 4907 put up the sign on the
Roman Catholic church's lawn in June. It shows a baby and says
``Kill Her Now ... It's Murder. Kill Her Before Birth ... It's
Abortion.''
   ``It's a freedom-of-speech issue,'' Robert Rafano, the attorney
representing the church and council, said Wednesday.
   Borough zoning officer Jack McDonald said he doesn't care what
message is on the sign as long as the sign is legal. Now, he said,
the 72-square-foot billboard exceeds the size limit of 25 square
feet.
   But Rafano argued the ordinance does not mention signs with a
``public message'' and the law does not apply.
   ``How can we exercize freedom of speech if people can't read our
message?'' he said.
   McDonald acknowledged that borough officials began to look into
the billboard after someone complained anonymously to police.
   ``The complainant said the anti-abortion message is distasteful
and offensive and the picture of the baby on the sign is
distraction to traffic,'' he said. ``But the size is in violation
of the zoning ordinance.
   ``The content has nothing to do with anything as far as I'm
concerned.''
   On June 14, the borough issued a notice to the church that said
the billboard's size violated the zoning ordinance. Facing a
summons, the church sued.

<HEAD>Corn Enzymes Protect Plant From Drought Stress, Up To A Point</HEAD>

   Corn plants continue curling up and showing
other signs of stress from heat and drought, and scientists think
they know why, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   The department's Agricultural Research Service reported that two
enzymes in corn and other plants help limit stress from heat and
drought ``within a temperature range we call a thermal kinetic
window.''
   Researchers said that when the plant's temperature rises above
the window, its ability to fight heat stress starts to fade. And
when there is a lack of water for use by the plant's natural
cooling system, the enzymes become less effective and the plant
withers and dies.
   The enzymes identified by agency scientists in Lubbock, Texas,
are glutathione reductase, which stops the buildup of potentially
lethal waste products as a plant fights heat stress, and
hydroxypyruvate reductase, which is thought to protect
photosynthesis, or the plant's food-making process, during stress.
   Jerry L. Hatfield, a research leader at the laboratory, said
thermal kinetic windows vary by plant species and are much narrower
than expected. For example, corn has a window in a range of 77 to
88 degrees Fahrenheit; cucumbers, 93 to 100; wheat, 62 to 73;
spinach, 50 to 63; and cotton 73 to 90.
   One of the goals of the research is to transfer one plant's
genes for controlling an enzyme's behavior into other plants,
thereby producing crops that are more tolerant to heat, drought and
other stresses than they otherwise would be, Hatfield said in a
report issued here.
   ``Although such advances may be a long way off, they could lead
to crops better equipped to face such climatic changes as the
gradual heating that may occur from the buildup of carbon dioxide
in the earth's atmosphere,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, a report by the government's Joint Agricultural
Weather Facility said rain and cooler weather in the week of June
27 to July 3 ``eased drought stress in the Great Plains, Delta and
western Corn Belt'' but that ``the lack of moisture worsened in
most Corn Belt states.''
   Overall, the corn crop was in ``still mostly fair-to-poor''
condition, the report said.
   An estimated 96 percent of the nation's soybeans had been
planted by July 3, slightly behind the normal pace. The crop was
reported in ``mostly fair'' condition in the Great Plains and
Southeast but were said to be ``mostly poor'' in the Delta states.
   ``Cooler temperatures eased livestock stress,'' the report said.
``Ranchers continued culling herds as forage supplies decreased.
Producers provided supplemental feed in most areas. Pastures were
mostly poor and showed very little regrowth.''

<HEAD>Industrial Nations Said Doing Well, But Poverty Rises in Third
World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosperity is continuing in the United States
and other industrial countries but poverty is on the rise in the
Third World, the World Bank said Wednesday.
   ``A healthy growth is now expected this year in the industrial
countries,'' Stanley Fischer, the bank's chief economist, said at a
news conference. ``The value of the dollar has stabilized and has
even begun to rise slightly.''
   The bank's study, ``World Development Report 1988'' predicted
that if the United States and other leading governments follow what
the bank sees as the right policies, the average income of their
citizens will grow by 2.6 percent a year between 1987 and 1995.
   The right policies, it said, included ``credible action'' to
reduce the U.S. federal budget deficit and creation of more demand
for goods in Japan, West Germany and industrializing countries such
as South Korea and Taiwan.
   It gave the average U.S. income for 1986 as $17,480, for Japan
as $12,840 and for a poor African country like Tanzania, $250.
   But it calculated that countries in sub-Saharan Africa will see
their incomes grow by only 0.7 percent annually.
   ``In some developing countries the prolonged economic slump is
already more severe than it was during the Great Depression (of the
1930s) in the industrial countries,'' the report said. ``The tide
of poverty and misery in those countries is rising, not receding.''
   The World Bank, which is owned by 151 countries, tries to raise
living standards in the poor ones by providing loans on easy terms.
It lends about $17 billion a year and wants to increase that by 10
percent annually. The ambition could be hampered by reluctance in
Congress to contribute to an increase of the bank's capital.
   The report said much must be done to reverse the way things are
going in the poorer countries.
   ``Since 1980 matters have turned from bad to worse,'' it said.
In most Third World countries, growth has slowed, wages have
dropped, job creation has faltered, and farm prices and government
spending on social services both have declined.
   ``The number of people below the poverty line increased at least
up to 1983-4 in Brazil, Chile, Ghana, Jamaica, Peru and the
Philippines ...,'' the report added.
   ``There has been a sharp reversal in the trend toward improved
standards of child health, nutrition and education ... In 21 out of
35 low-income developing countries, the daily calorie supply ...
was lower in 1985 than in 1965. Between 1979 and 1982 life
expectancy declined in nine sub-Saharan countries. In Zimbabwe
deaths from malnutrition among infants and children doubled during
1980-4 ....''
   Bank officials saw improvement in the poor countries as
depending heavily on what happens in the rich ones.
   The report predicted that if the policies it recommends are not
followed, incomes in the industrial countries will grow by only 1.8
percent a year between 1987 and 1995 _ slightly less than earlier
in the decade. In that case it saw Third World incomes growing at
2.2 percent and not at all in Africa below the Sahara.
   Growth traditionally is more rapid in developing countries than
in the industrialized ones.
   The report blamed military spending for worsening the situation.
   ``Evidence increasingly points to high military spending as
contributing to fiscal and debt crises, complicating stabilization
and adjustment, and negatively affecting economic growth and
development,'' it said.
   ``Whatever benefits might arise from such spending must be
carefully weighed against these heavy costs.''

   An Iranian diplomat sent a message of condolence
Wednesday to the wife of an Italian killed in the downing of an
Iran Air jetliner, denouncing the ``act of injustice and
oppression'' by the United States.
   Salman Ghaffari, Iran's ambassador to the Holy See, sent a
telegram to Angela Caputo, whose 53-year-old husband, Antonio, was
among those killed when the American cruiser Vincennes shot down
the plane Sunday.
   ``Sharing in your grief, I offer my most heart-felt condolences
over the death of your husband,'' said the telegram, which was
released by the embassy. ``This act of injustice and oppression
committed by the U.S.A. which today afflicts you is the sad fate
which America has imposed on the people of Iran for many years.''
   Ghaffari charged that the incident never would have occurred
``if the American military, thousands of kilometers from its own
borders, had not carried out a military intervention, interfering
in the affairs of the countries of the Persian Gulf.''

   Iranians shouting ``Death to America!''
and waving banners vowing revenge held funerals Wednesday for 24 of
the 290 people killed when a U.S. warship shot down an Iranian
airliner.
   Fourteen were buried in Bandar Abbas, starting point for the
short flight over the Strait of Hormuz to Dubai, and the others
were buried at Zahedan, in southeastern Iran, Iranian television
reported.
   Iran said 200 bodies had been recovered from the gulf since
missiles fired by the USS Vincennes destroyed the plane Sunday. All
but 38 of those on the plane were Iranians.
   The television broadcast 15 minutes of scenes from the funerals
in Bandar Abbas and Zahedan. It said hundreds of thousands of
Iranians joined the processions to mourn the victims and
demonstrate solidarity with leaders who have called for revenge.
   Women clad in head-to-toe black chadors marched silently behind
the coffins carrying banners, some of which read: ``America: You
fight with weapons and we with our belief in God, and your defeat
is imminent,'' ``Revenge Revenge,'' ``War until victory.''
   Men waved their fists, shouting ``Death to America!'' and ``Down
with Reagan!''
   Coffins were draped with Iranian flags: green, white and red
with ``Allah'' or ``God,'' written in the middle.
   Several jeeps carrying Revolutionary Guards drove behind the
marchers, using loudspeakers to blare revolutionary songs and
verses from the Koran, the holy book of Islam.
   A larger ceremony and march is scheduled for Thursday in Tehran
for the other victims whose bodies have been recovered, the
television said.

   Optimism over upcoming Cambodian peace
talks has been overshadowed by a lack of compromise on two key
issues: the future of the Khmer Rouge and the formation of a new
government.
   Foreign ministers of Southeast Asian countries said a trend
toward dialogue has created more optimism than ever before about
ending the 9-year-old war between Cambodian guerrillas and the
Vietnamese occupying the country.
   Thailand's Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda told the annual
conference of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations that
``peace ... is at hand.'' He said the region soon can focus on
economic development and usher in ``a new era of peace and
prosperity.''
   The ministers ended the conference Tuesday and are to start
talks Thursday with Western leaders, including Secretary of State
George Shultz. They're expected to ask for help in guaranteeing a
settlement in Cambodia.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 after bloody border
clashes with the communist Khmer Rouge regime, which killed
hundreds of thousands of its people from 1975-78. Vietnamese forces
installed a sympathetic government and are battling a guerrilla
coalition of the Khmer Rouge and forces of former Cambodian leaders
Prince Norodom Sihanouk and Son Sann.
   The Cambodian factions, Vietnam, Laos, and ASEAN countries are
to attend informal peace talks in Indonesia on July 25. But they
face the same hurdles that abruptly halted earlier talks between
Sihanouk and Hun Sen, prime minister of the pro-Vietnam Cambodian
government.
   Indonesia's Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, organizer of the talks,
told The Associated Press Monday that ``many obstacles'' to an
agreement remain. Although the parties agree on the final outcome,
they differ widely on how to get there, he said.
   One problem is the Khmer Rouge.
   The pro-Vietnamese government's SPK news agency on Wednesday
called the group ``the greatest obstacle'' to a settlement. Worries
of a return of the Khmer Rouge, the strongest guerrilla force, have
intensified with Vietnam's pullout of 50,000 troops this year and
stated plans to withdraw the remaining 50,000 by 1990.
   Some diplomats say the Khmer Rouge is storing arms, avoiding
direct military clashes and infiltrating villages to prepare
all-out attacks in 1990.
   Vietnam and the Hun Sen government insist that the Khmer Rouge
be dismantled as a military and political organization and that
leader Pol Pot and his top aides not be allowed any role in
Cambodia's future because of their ``genocide'' and threat to
Vietnam's security.
   Official Vietnamese radio said Tuesday the troop pullout opened
the door to a negotiated settlement, but the second key problem,
Pol Pot, remains. It quoted Vietnam's Foreign Minister Nguyen Co
Thach as saying the world community has a responsibility to ensure
the Khmer Rouge does not return to power.
   The Khmer Rouge, armed mainly by China, has remained silent on
the demands regarding its leadership.
   But China recently called for formation of a coalition
government and a freeze on all force levels until elections are
held.
   Sihanouk told the ASEAN ministers the Khmer Rouge has agreed to
his proposal to dissolve the resistance coalition and the
pro-Vietnamese government at the same time. In Sihanouk's scheme,
the four factions would form a provisional government after
Vietnam's complete pullout and organize general elections leading
to a neutral nation.
   Hun Sen has flatly rejected dissolution of his government and
said the guerrilla factions must instead join his regime.
   The SPK commentary said the Hun Sen government has controlled
all the country's territory since 1979 and its dissolution would
mean the return of the Khmer Rouge regime.
   A resistance radio broadcast Tuesday said free elections could
not be held under the auspices of the Hun Sen government.
   The radio said Hun Sen's refusal to budge on this point showed
it wanted to impose the communist regime and also ``that Vietnam
does not yet have the good will to find a solution to the Cambodian
problem.''

<HEAD>Singers Sing Sweetly, but Competition Is Tough at Barbership
Quartet Contest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Barbership quartets are upbeat about a
resurgence of interest in their music, and they're singing out loud
and clear on the 50th anniversary of their international society.
   More than 10,000 people have registered for this week's
international convention of the Society for the Preservation and
Encouragement of Barbershop Quartet Singing in America.
   ``I think we are gaining some respect again across the
country,'' said James Warner, a Memphis attorney and international
president of the 38,000-member organization.
   ``We are developing programs for young men in some high schools
and it's found increasing acceptance,'' he said. ``We're not using
it as a recruitment device, but as an attempt to reach out to young
men in that area,'' he said.
   Barbershop quartets, which popped up mainly on the East Coast at
the turn of the century and were popular during the vaudeville era,
use four-part harmonies to carry tunes. The lead singer carries the
melody. A tenor harmonizes and a baritone and a bass carry the
lower chords. There is no instrumental accompaniment.
   Competition begins Thursday with 51 quartets battling for five
finalist positions. Sixteen choruses comprised of 50 men also will
vie for five finalist positions.
   The finals are scheduled for Saturday with one gold, one silver
and three bronze medals being awarded in each category and the gold
medal winner becoming the international champion.
   ``This is the Olympics of barbershop singing and all of them
have had to battle on the local level to get here,'' Warner said.
``It will be a tough competition because there is a lot of prestige
that goes with the medals.''
   On Wednesday, crooners warmed up, gathering in hotel rooms and
hallways to belt out such barbershop classics as ``Sweet Adeline.''
   Greg Zinke, 27, a member of the Northeast Extension of
Pemberton, N.J., said he began singing in a quartet after being
around his father's group.
   Zinke, who works in a tool and die shop in High Bridge, N.J.,
said he opted for barbershop quartet singing instead of rock 'n
roll because of the selection of clean, simple old songs.
   ``You don't have to be a fantastic singer to do this. I think
that's what makes it so nice for the guy off the street who admires
the music. He can come sing it, too,'' he said.
   For a long time, barbershop quartet singing was in a decline, as
the vaudeville era came to an end with the advent of motion
pictures and other forms of music after World War I.
   In 1938, Owen C. Cash, a tax attorney in Tulsa, Okla., and
Rupert Hall, another Tulsa businessman, formed the society to
preserve the old music.
   Their group helped revive interest, and there are now 2,000
quartets and 800 choruses divided into 16 regions in the United
States and Canada and other groups in England, Sweden, West
Germany, Holland and New Zealand.
   Doctors, lawyers, researchers, plumbers, electricians are among
the barbershop quartet singers, but ironically, few barbers are
members of the organization, Warner said.
   ``It' easy to sing and it's portable,'' said 35-year-old Roger
Payne of Manhattan. ``All you have to have is your pitch pipe and
three other guys and you don't have to call anybody to move your
piano. It interacts with the audience in a real entertainment-kind
of way.''

<HEAD>State Department Probes Whether UN Agency Funneling Aid To
Palestinians</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In a secret exchange with United Nations
officials, the State Department has explored reports that rioting
Palestinian Arabs on the Israeli-held West Bank and in Gaza were
financed through a U.N. agency, but the reports were denied ``and
the case is closed,'' two U.S. officials said Wednesday.
   While channeling aid to the Palestinians who began their
uprising last December may not be illegal, allowing the U.N. Relief
Works Agency to be used that way would upset Israel, the officials
said in separate interviews.
   ``We didn't like it, either,'' one of the officials said.
``UNRWA is not supposed to be a conduit for funds, legal or
illegal. It's not what UNRWA is about.''
   But the other official said the U.S. concern was based entirely
on Israeli ``sensitivity.''
   The officials discussed the secret inquiry only on condition
they would not be identified.
   THe U.N. agency distributes assistance to tens of thousands of
Palestinian refugees who live in camps on the West Bank and in
Gaza. More than 17,000 Palestinians work for UNRWA in the
territories.
   The reports reached the State Department about a month ago, and
prompted cabled inquires to the U.N. agency's headquarters in
Vienna where they were flatly denied. ``We don't have a problem,''
a U.S. official said. ``But it doesn't mean it can't happen again.''
   With Israel's implicit approval, an Arab fund supervised by
Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organization had provided aid
to Palestinians in the Israeli-held territories apart from U.N.
assistance. But after the outbreak of violence last December,
Israel sought to impose controls on the assistance.
   The Arab League, meeting last month in Algeria, responded by
deciding to provide $129 million to the Palestinians, including
demonstrators and rioters, to support the uprising. Some 200
Palestinians and 3 Israelis have died in clashes that some Israeli
officials say were ordered by the PLO in an attempt to destabilize
the Jewish state.
   In asking UNRWA authorities for an explanation, ``we went in not
with a reprimand but with a question,'' one of the officials said.
``The reports were denied. We accepted it.''
   He added: ``It's an issue Israelis are very sensitive about.''
   The official said the report did not specify the amount of money
said to be passing to the Palestinians through the U.N. agency.
   He said the State Department inquiry ``was handled in a pretty
restricted channel,'' but was now becoming known because of the
cable traffic between Washington and Vienna.

<TEXT>
   David T. Wilentz, who gained worldwide
attention in 1935 when he prosecuted Bruno Richard Hauptmann for
the kidnap and murder of the Lindbergh baby, has died at age 93.
   Wilentz, the father of state Supreme Court Chief Justice Robert
N. Wilentz, died ``peacefully in his sleep'' Tuesday night at his
summer home in Long Branch, said Anne Riegle, a family spokeswoman.
   Gov. Thomas H. Kean said Wilentz's death ``marks the passing of
a figure and personality of near legendary proportions.''
   His death came hours after a federal appeals court in
Philadelphia rejected the most recent effort of Hauptmann's widow,
Anna, to clear her husband's name.
   Born in Dwinsk, Latvia, on Dec. 21, 1894, Wilentz came to the
United States at age 6 and became a naturalized citizen in 1900.
   As a young state attorney general, he handled his first criminal
case when he prosecuted Hauptmann in what became known as ``the
trial of the century.''
   Hauptmann was convicted of kidnapping the 20-month-old son of
aviator Charles Lindbergh from his East Amwell estate and then
murdering the child. He was executed April 3, 1936, at Trenton
State Prison.
   The trial was followed worldwide and journalist H.L. Mencken
called it ``the biggest event since the Resurrection.'' Wilentz,
who personally opposed the death penalty, was noted during the
trial for his eloquence.
   Some students of the case and Mrs. Hauptmann continue to claim
Hauptmann was innocent and was railroaded during the trial.
   After a decade as attorney general, Wilentz, whose main home was
in Perth Amboy, served as chairman of the state Democratic
Committee.
   Although he considered running for governor, he later told
friends he decided that New Jersey at that time would not elect a
Jewish governor.
   Wilentz went on to found one of the most prominent and powerful
law firms in the state. He also was the former director of the
board of Amerada Hess Corp.
   Despite his advancing age, Wilentz continued to report for work
frequently at the family's Woodbridge law firm, and he had spent
some time working at the firm Tuesday.
   ``He was active from the time he was admitted to practice law in
1919 right to the present,'' Ms. Riegle said.
   She said funeral arrangements were pending.
   Wilentz is survived by his wife, Lena; sons Robert and Warren;
and his daughter Norma Hess.

   Donations for construction of a $37,000
monument honoring the USS Vincennes have spurted since the warship
downed an Iranian passenger jetliner, according to the chairman of
the fund-raising committee.
   More than $500 in donations arrived in Wednesday's mail, said
James Funk, fund-raising chairman of the monument project. Last
week, the first week of the drive, only $161 was donated, he said.
   ``I believe the increase came from both exposure to the facts
about the four ships named Vincennes and as an expression of the
people's support of the present situation the current ship is in,''
Funk said.
   Fund-raisers already have collected about two-thirds of the
money needed to build a $37,000 monument honoring the USS Vincennes
and three other Navy ships of the same name.
   The USS Vincennes Association, which includes veterans of the
four ships, will pay half of that cost and has already raised more
than $14,000. Local businesses have donated more than $10,000
toward the city's half, Funk said.
   Officials say 290 civilians died Sunday when the Vincennes, an
Aegis-class guided missile cruiser, shot down the commercial
airliner. The action came after the pilot failed to respond to
several radio challenges on civilian and military frequencies.
   The warship is the fourth to bear the Vincennes name. The
southwestern Indiana city plans to construct a pyramid of granite
to commemorate the four ships. Each side of the pyramid will bear a
silhouette and history of one of the ships.
   The first ship, a wooden sloop-of-war, was launched in 1826 and
was the first Navy ship to circumnavigate the globe. During a
four-year worldwide voyage that began in 1838, artifacts were
gathered that became the foundation of the Smithsonian Institution.
   The second ship, a heavy cruiser, CA-44, was commissioned in
1937 and sunk by Japanese gunfire Aug. 9, 1942 off Savo Island
during the battle for Guadalcanal.
   The third ship, a light cruiser, CL-64, was commissioned Jan.
21, 1944 and served in the Pacific. The ship received six battle
stars and was decommissioned in 1946. It was sunk for use as a
target ship, but the bell was salvaged and is on display at
Vincennes City Hall.
   The current ship, the first Aegis-class cruiser to join the
Pacific fleet, was commissioned July 6, 1985.

   Hundreds of callers have pledged their
support for the USS Vincennes commander who ordered the downing of
an Iran Air jetliner, his relatives say.
   Capt. William C. Rogers III has been called a hero by people who
have telephoned from across the state and country, his brother,
artist Richard Harrell Rogers, said Tuesday.
   ``They generally say he did the only thing he could to protect
his men,'' the brother said. ``People consider him to be a hero.
But everyone considers it a tragic loss of life.''
   On Sunday, the Vincennes fired two missiles at an Iran Airbus
A300, destroying it and killing 290 passengers and crew members.
   ``I've lost count of the enormous number of calls,'' said
Richard Rogers. ``Most are from people we know, but haven't heard
from in a long time. The phone hasn't stopped ringing.''
   Friends of William Rogers from his 1957 graduating class at
Jefferson High School also voiced support for him.
   ``He was defending his ship and his crew members,'' said Ben
Corbo, a Kelly Air Force Base civil servant. ``If it were me, I
probably would have done the same thing. You can't fault him for
that.''

<HEAD>Closed Hearing Held on North Request to Use Classified Documents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fired White House aide Oliver L. North and his
defense lawyers attended a closed hearing Wednesday to argue their
requests to use secret documents as evidence in the Iran-Contra
conspiracy case.
   The hearing before U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell was
closed both to the public and to prosecutors, to protect the
secrecy of the documents and North's defense strategy.
   Gesell convened the hearing to begin the process of reviewing
North's requests and determine if the material culled from the mass
of secret documents collected by prosecutors is relevant to the
case.
   North has been given until July 11 to file a list of secret
documents he proposes to use in defending charges he conspired to
illegally divert profits from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to the
Nicaraguan rebels.
   After the judge determines which, if any, of the documents may
be used as evidence, Gesell will conduct closed proceedings with
government attorneys present to determine whether the material can
be released at a public trial.
   Separate trials have been ordered for North, former national
security adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim
and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord.
   The judge has not set a trial date for North, saying the case is
not ready to be tried because of the lack of progress in
declassifying the 200,000 pages of classified documents collected
by independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh.
   In a brief filing, Walsh reported no further progress in
discussions with government agencies about ways to delete sensitive
portions of documents he intends to introduce into evidence.
   ``A number of the issues raised by those documents, particularly
those that relate to geographical locations, are under ongoing
consideration at high levels at those agencies,'' Walsh said in the
filing.
   But, he said, ``no matter how those issues are resolved, we
believe that the case can proceed'' with appropriate editing of
classified material or ``in a few cases, substitutions for the
documents'' with statements of what they would prove.
   Fewer than 10 documents contain material so sensitive that Walsh
said he would ask the judge to allow prosecutors to show them only
to the court and jury.
   Walsh said most of the problems relate to the use of symbols to
protect names, places and countries. ``The more difficult problem
arising from the protection of sources and intelligence activities
can for the most part be solved'' by editing of material that is
irrelevant to the case, he said.
   Walsh also reported that Edward S.G. Dennis, acting assistant
attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's criminal
division, has been designated to speak for the Reagan
administration on issues dealing with classified material.
   The task should be made easier because Walsh has withdrawn 226
of the 628 classified documents he originally planned to use as
evidence, according to court papers.
   The original list of 628 documents was submitted to the court
before Gesell ordered four separate trials.

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police reopened an investigation into the 1968
death of the second wife of Melvyn Paisley, a central figure in the
Pentagon procurement investigation, because of discrepancies
between his story and an autopsy report, authorities said Wednesday.
   The autopsy and a separate medical investigator's report that
contains Paisley's account include ``inconsistencies,'' said Maj.
Terry Allman, head of the King County Police criminal investigation
division.
   The May 7, 1968, death of 30-year-old Mary Lou Paisley was ruled
accidental at the time.
   Allman would not detail any discrepancies, but said: ``The fact
that a woman had taken a drink along with two sleeping pills _ and
a woman of fairly small stature _ and then gotten up in the middle
of the night to paint and was found facedown in a rag ... seemed
rather odd.''
   Medical examiner records from 1968 show Paisley told
investigators his wife had an alcoholic drink and took two of his
Doriden sleeping pills before going to bed the night of her death.
   Several hours later, the records quote him as saying, he awoke
to find his wife face down in the bathroom on a towel containing
carbon tetrachloride, a cleaning solvent for paintbrushes.
   ``He said she apparently had gotten restless and got up and was
painting pictures and was cleaning up her brushes when she
apparently was overcome by the fumes,'' the medical examiner's
report said.
   The autopsy report is confidential. But King County Medical
Examiner Dr. Donald Reay said there was no trace of sleeping pills,
alcohol or carbon tetrachloride in the dead woman's blood. Lab
tests may not have been sensitive enough to detect small amounts,
but there is no way of knowing now for sure, he said.
   Next to cause of death, the coroner's report has a question
mark, followed by ``drug hypersensitivity.''
   ``There is nothing in there that indicates violence ... chemical
violence or physical violence,'' Reay told The Seattle Times.
``It's the absence of findings that would allow one to draw
conclusions. ... That's what makes this a puzzling case.''
   Melvyn Paisley is a former assistant Navy secretary and
ex-Boeing Co. executive, who has been accused of bribing Pentagon
officials and steering military contracts to companies he later
served as a private consultant.
   ``I think the general publicity about the man piqued our
interest and we went back and looked at the limited information in
the case,'' County police spokesman Dick Larson said Wednesday.
   Lack of police records, however, could stymie investigators, he
said.
   ``That's one of the problems _ the documents were destroyed,''
he said.
   Officers would be questioned who investigated the case and are
no longer with the department but still alive.
   Paisley's attorney, Lawrence Barcella of Washington, D.C., did
not immediately return a phone call from The Associated Press on
Wednesday, but told Seattle newspapers police ``are going to waste
valuable time and resources.''
   Since the death of Mrs. Paisley, Paisley's second wife, Paisley
has married and divorced a third wife and now is married a fourth
time.
   ``(Paisley) told me the police tried to pin it on him,'' said
James Durst of Bellevue, who worked with Paisley at Boeing. ``He
said they gave him a bad time for several months but let him go
because there was nothing wrong.''

<HEAD>Proposed Tightening Of Racial Segregation Criticized</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposed bill to increase
penalties for violation of segregation laws and to facilitate
evictions and confiscation of property came under criticism
Wednesday.
   The pro-government newspaper, The Citizen, called on Parliament
to reconsider the Group Areas Amendment proposed last week. ``Its
penalties are excessively harsh, it is open to abuse, it is harmful
to race relations, and it is bound to cause further damage to the
country's image abroad,'' said an editorial in the English-language
paper.
   The bill would allow inspectors to search for violators of the
racial segregation laws and magistrates to penalize people for not
appearing in court when accused by anyone of a violation. It would
require eviction even when there was no housing available in the
violator's own ``group area.'' The law provides no appeal of a
magistrate's decision and allows the government to confiscate
houses and apartments that are rented to people in the wrong race
classification.
   The bill also increases the penalties for violation of racial
segregation laws from $250 fines or three months in jail to $5,000
fines or five years in prison.
   It ``contains some fearsome provisions, hardly distinguishable
from the Nazi treatment of Jews,'' said Business Day, a daily
newspaper that generally reflects the views of the business
community.
   ``One explanation for the latest official policy on group areas
is that government has lost its wits, which is a possibility ...
For the moment, we assume they are sane, but wrong,'' the paper
said.
   Both papers suggested that the government was trying to put up a
tough image to win conservative, right-wing votes in the October
municipal elections.
   The proposed legislation on segregation was accompanied by
another bill that would allow for the first time the mixing of
races in designated residential areas.
   Some white neighborhoods in major South African cities have over
the years become illegally mixed as whites moved to the suburbs,
while blacks, ``Coloreds'' and Indians, moved into the city.
   Newspapers, politicans and lawyers predicted increased tension
and bad publicity if the government tried to reverse the tide in
such entrenched mixed areas by enforcing the proposed law.
   The proposed bill is to be debated in the next session of
Parliament, beginning Aug. 22. Business Day predicted neither the
mixed-race nor the Indian chambers of Parliament would approve it.
   But the ruling Nationalist Party has a majority in the white
chamber of Parliament and controls the President's Council, which
can pass legislation opposed by the two smaller, non-white chambers.
   In the southern port city of Durban, which has large Indian
population, two groups opposing the bill set the stage for major
civil confrontations and court actions.
   The White Liberation Movement, a suprematist group, said, ``If
the proper powers do not take the necessary steps themselves to
enforce the laws, we will ensure that the offenders are removed.''
   It said there were 9,000 people living illegally in Durban. But
the local branch of Lawyers for Human Rights said 150 attorneys in
the area would provide free legal representation to fight every
case.
   ``These people have nowhere to go,'' the lawyers said. ``There
is no room in black areas and flats are lying vacant in white
areas.''
   The government said it will take decades to construct homes for
the concentration of blacks in urban areas, where a now-disavowed
government policy once limited the availability of housing to keep
them away.

<HEAD>Former Bakker Home Sold At Auction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT MILL, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parsonage formerly occupied by PTL
ministry founder Jim Bakker and his family has been sold to a New
Jersey businessman who bid $685,000 for the luxurious lakeside home.
   PTL Attorney Edwin Allman conducted the auction between only two
bidders at the World Outreach Center at Heritage USA on Tuesday.
   PTL originally had agreed to sell the Bakker house to Robert M.
Rubino for $625,000, Allman said in U.S. Bankruptcy Court on June
29. However, Judge Rufus Reynolds told Allman to conduct an auction
after a competing bid of $666,000 from an unnamed Houston man was
announced in court.
   ``He's a delightful businessman who will be moving to Tega
Cay,'' Allman said of Rubino. Tega Cay is a community beside Lake
Wylie and a few miles from PTL's Heritage USA complex.
   Rubino owned several pizza restaurants and other real estate in
and around New Jersey, Allman said.
   The 10,266-square-foot house has four bedrooms, 5{ bathrooms, a
36-foot long swimming pool, a whirlpool, a guardhouse, a playhouse,
a boat dock, a marble entry foyer, an exercise room, a music room
and a kitchen crammed with appliances and cherry cabinetry.
   The sale of the Bakker house ended more than three months of
effort by PTL officials to sell the vacant property.
   PTL tried to sell the Bakker's house and 10 other pieces of
property at an auction in Tega Cay on April 12.
   At that time, then-PTL Trustee David Clark said he hoped to
raise $1 million from the sale of the Bakker house alone to help
the ministry reorganize. However, that auction failed to garner
even an opening bid as high as $500,000 for the house.
   Allman said in bankruptcy court that a recent assessment of the
property had determined the fair market value of the Bakkers' house
to be $650,000.
   ``We were satisfied with the price paid for the house,'' Allman
said.
   The Bakkers did not file an objection to the sale of their
former residence and were not present for the auction.
   Tammy Bakker, however, cried for several minutes at the June 29
bankruptcy hearing as the sale of the house was discussed.
   ``It's a house I loved because we raised our children in it,'
she said after the hearing.''
   The Bakkers again are living along Lake Wylie, this time in a
house rented for them by supporters in their bid to regain the
ministry Bakker founded then lost last year in a sex-and-money
scandal.
   Bakker stepped down in March 1987 as it was revealed he had sex
in 1980 with a church secretary, Jessica Hahn, and paid a reported
$363,700 in hush money to silence her.
   Donations to the ministry then fell amid revelations of a lavish
lifestyle led by the Bakkers and other PTL officials and the
ministry now is in bankruptcy court seeking to reorganize, sell off
assets and repay about $130 million in debt.

   Farmers in designated drought areas who donate
all the hay cut from land in two conservation programs will not
have their federal acreage payments reduced, Agriculture Secretary
Richard E. Lyng announced Wednesday.
   Previously, farmers who harvested hay from land enrolled in the
Conservation Reserve Program, or CRP, and the Water Bank Program,
or WBP, would have their annual payments reduced by 25 percent the
following year.
   Lyng said that to be eligible for the exemption, a producer must
donate the hay through a designated state agency engaged in
drought-relief efforts and obtain certification from an official of
the agency that the hay has been donated properly.
   More than 1,800 counties have been designated by USDA as drought
areas eligible for the special haying privileges.
   Under the two programs, farmers enroll land for 10 years and
agree not to produce crops on it. They are required to plant
protective grasses or trees to prevent erosion and are paid annual
rental fees by the government for maintaining the acreage.
   Typically, the fees average $40 to $50 per acre annually. Thus,
without the exemption, hay donated to help other farmers would
result in a loss of $10 or more per year in federal payments.

   The former commander of the USS Stark said
Wednesday that the downing of an Iranian commercial jet by a Navy
warship was not necessarily similar to the Iraqi jet attack on his
ship that killed 37 sailors and forced him out of the service.
   ``The CO (commanding officer) had a hard time,'' said Glenn R.
Brindel of the decision by Capt. Will C. Rogers III of the USS
Vincennes to shoot down the oncoming Iranian Air Airbus A-300. ``He
called the shots the way he had to.
   ``Some people are trying to draw parallels between the two
incidents. I don't necessarily concur with that.''
   Brindel said he did not wish to comment further.
   Brindel's ship was hit in the Persian Gulf by two Exocet
missiles fired from an Iraqi jet 12 miles away. The frigate had
little warning before the missiles struck. The ship's Phalanx
anti-aircraft system was not engaged at the time of the attack.
   The Vincennes, a sophisticated Aegis-class cruiser, was
receiving confusing radio signals from the Airbus, making
identification of the craft difficult. At the same time, the
Vincennes and another Navy warship were engaging several Iranian
gunboats that had fired on one of the Vincennes' helicopters.
   When the aircraft did not respond to several warnings from the
Vincennes, Navy officials said Rogers ordered two missiles launched
at the plane. Based on the information available, the captain said
he believed the plane to be an F-14.
   Iranian authorities said 290 people were aboard; there were no
survivors.
   In the 1987 attack on the Stark, a Navy investigation found that
the ship was never ready or capable of repelling an attack and
recommended that Brindel, then a captain, be court-martialed.
   Instead, the Navy allowed Brindel to retire at the rank of
commander after he was given a letter of reprimand.
   Adm. Frank B. Kelso, commander-in-chief of the Atlantic Fleet,
said the decision not to follow the recommendation of investigators
was based in part on the surprise nature of the attack and the
heroic response of Brindel and his crew in saving the ship.
   Brindel now sells real estate in Virginia Beach, Va.

   The House on Wednesday passed 342-40 a bill
continuing the Small Business Administration's subsidy programs and
rejecting President Reagan's call to end SBA direct loans.
   The measure includes provisions giving aid to firms seeking to
sell overseas, and banning SBA assistance for firms engaging in
business with South Africa.
   The bill, which goes next to the Senate, authorizes $470 million
in SBA spending next year, $514 million in fiscal 1990 and $566 in
fiscal 1991. It also authorizes spending as necessary for disaster
assistance loans.
   Total SBA-supported loans would reach $3.7 billion next year,
under the bill, up from about $3.2 billion this year.
   Under Congress' multi-step spending process, the final levels
for the SBA and its programs will be set later in appropriations
bills.

<HEAD>Mom Who Dressed Son As A Pig Pleads Not Guilty To Child Abuse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAYWARD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unemployed single mother pleaded not
guilty to child abuse Wednesday after tying her son's hands,
dressing him up in a pig costume and putting him on public display
as punishment for shoplifting.
   Mary Francis Bergamasco's father said she feels bad about
embarrassing her son but felt nothing short of that punishment
would stop his mini-crime spree.
   Bergamasco, 29, was charged with misdemeanor child abuse for
taping a cardboard pig nose to the crying seven-year-old boy's
face, tying his hands behind his back and placing him on the porch
of their apartment building on June 28 with a sign reading:
   ``I'm dumb pig (sic). Ugly is what you will become everytime you
lie and steal. Look at me squeel (sic). My hands are tied because I
cannot be trusted. This is a lesson to be learned. Look. Laugh.
Thief. Stealing. Bad bo.''
   San Leandro-Hayward Municipal Court Judge John Burke set a
preliminary hearing for July 18 and freed Bergamasco on her own
recognizance.
   Her son and 1-year-old daughter were taken into protective
custody and placed in separate foster homes when Bergamasco was
arrested last Tuesday.
   According to police, Bergamasco said in a statement she wanted
her son to understand ``for if only 30 minutes that lying and
stealing make you ugly like Pinocchio.''
   Union City police investigated Bergamasco on a report of child
abandonment in March, according to court records. Two warrants had
been issued for her arrest after she failed to make court
appearances.
   Joseph Bergamasco, 53, of Union City, defended his daughter's
action. She said her son stole $25 worth of baseball cards, $6
cash, an earring, a belt buckle and another child's toy over a
two-week period.
   ``We hoped this would just be a phase, but it kept happening,''
he said. ``So as a last recourse, she thought she had to embarrass
him so he could stop being a thief.''
   ``She feels bad that (the boy) was embarrassed, but she's glad
she did what she did,'' he said. ``And I think she was right, too.
I stand behind my daughter. I don't feel she was being abusive.''
   The boy's friend, Greg Childers, 9, said, ``I saw him and I
tried to take the sign off, but I couldn't.
   ``He was sweating, and he felt really bad. I felt so sorry for
him.''
   Neighbor Kim Sanchez, 20, said the boy was a troublemaker who
started fights and bragged about stealing, but she said she called
police because the punishment disgusted her.
   ``I could understand that she wanted to embarrass him, but there
was no need to tie him up,'' she said.
   Bergamasco said in her statement that her mother had used the
technique and also placed her children's hands over hot stove
burners. Dressing her son as a pig may have been wrong, she said,
but ``Mom said it worked on us kids.''
   ``This was public humiliation,'' said Sgt. Craig Hoyer, a child
abuse investigator for the Hayward Police Department. ``I mean,
when your peers see you like that, in my mind, it could almost
destroy a kid's psyche.''

   More than 10,000 Hungarians and
hundreds of foreign visitors gathered Wednesday to pay their last
respects to composer Bela Bartok, whose remains were returned to
his homeland from the United States.
   People filed past the coffin in the Academy of Science building
to the strains of ``Concerto,'' one of Bartok's most famous
orchestral compositions. A military honor guard stood at attention.
   The bier was draped with a black shroud and a carpet of wreaths
and flowers surrounded the coffin in the academy's columned
entrance hall.
   Bartok's remains returned Tuesday to Hungary 43 years after his
death in New York, following a journey through five nations, where
officials and musicians paid tribute to one the greatest composers
of this century.
   At the decision of his two sons, Bartok's remains were removed
from his grave at the cemetery of Ferncliff, N.Y., and returned
home.
   The ceremony laying Bartok to rest in Budapest's Farkasret
cemetery was scheduled for Thursday. Bartok will be buried in the
family tomb, close to his greatest friend and collaborator, Zoltan
Kodaly.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has come back into the U.S.
corn market after a three-month absence to buy 175,000 metric tons
for delivery this year under a long-term supply agreement between
the two countries, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 175,000 tons of
corn would be about 6.9 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.80 per bushel at the
farm level, meaning that the sale could have a farm value of around
$19 million.
   Prices have shot up recently, reflecting damage to this year's
crop. On March 31, the last time the Soviets bought a significant
amount of U.S. corn, the farm price was about $1.90 per bushel.
   The corn is part of the grain the Soviet Union is committed to
buy during the fifth and final year of the agreement, which calls
for the annual purchase of at least 9 million tons of U.S. grain.
The pact expires Sept. 30, and there have been negotiations for a
new one.
   According to the agreement, the annual purchases are supposed to
include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. The
Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as
wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as two
tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain
equivalent.
   With the latest purchases, the Soviets now have bought 4.36
million tons of corn, plus more than 9 million tons of wheat;
830,700 tons of soybeans, and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal.

Wednesday's presidential election:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the National Democratic Front _ A senator
and immediate past governor of Michoacan state for the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party, Cardenas, 54, last year led a
dissident movement to make the party more democratic and force
changes in the country's economic policy. The son of the late
President Lazaro Cardenas, he has advocated stopping crude oil
exports and using it to produce petrochemicals, suspending payments
on the $104 billion foreign debt while it is renegotiated and
recovering some of the state-owned companies the government has
been selling.

<TEXT>
   Manuel J. Clouthier of the National Action Party _ A 54-year-old
affluent business leader and rancher from the northwestern state of
Sinaloa, he is running for the National Action Party. He supports
private enterprise, more government austerity, greater foreign
investment and allowing campesinos to own land they currently can
use and pass on to their children, but not sell. National Action,
known as PAN, is the largest opposition party and for years was the
only significant opposition.

<TEXT>
   Rosario Ibarra De Piedra of the Revolutionary Workers Party _
She is a candidate for a second time of the Revolutionary Workers
Party, the most radical of the parties, but not a party member. She
created a human rights organization after her son disappeared
following his arrest in 1975. Mrs. Piedra, 61, advocates better
salaries, a Latin American front on the foreign debt and freedom of
expression and assembly.

<TEXT>
   Gumersindo Magana Negrete of the Mexican Democratic Party _ A
48-year-old lawyer, he is candidate of the Mexican Democratic
Party. The party describes itself as inspired by a social Christian
philosophy that supports neither Communism nor capitalism ``without
a social dimension.'' Magana was long active in the conservative
Catholic Sinarquista movement. He advocates formation of a Latin
American debtors' club to pressure for better terms and the
transfer of the debt held by private banks to governments so that
it can be negotiated politically.

<TEXT>
   Carlos Salinas De Gortari of the Institutional Revolutionary
Party _ A 40-year-old Harvard-educated economist, he has a long
career in government. As budget secretary for President Miguel de
la Madrid until he became candidate for the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, he was responsible for the austerity policy
used during the country's 6-year-long economic crisis. The party
has not lost a major election since it was founded in 1929. He has
pledged to modernize the country economically and politically, end
inflation, stabilize workers' buying power and accept victories by
other political parties.

   Armenian activists said Wednesday that Soviet Army
paratroopers fired on protesters trying to shut down Yerevan's
airport and killed up to five people. A Soviet official denied
there had been any clashes or deaths.
   ``The rumors that an Armenian were killed are groundless,''
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfilyev told a news conference.
   But Perfilyev and the activists agreed that some 2,000 people
had tried to shut down Zvartnots Airport, and that troops quashed
what the activists said was a political protest in the southern
republic related to a simmering territorial dispute.
   Since February, Yerevan has been the scene of massive
demonstrations by Armenians demanding annexation of
Nagorno-Karabakh, a mostly Armenian region of neighboring
Azerbaijan. Until now, the protests reportedly have been peaceful.
   The Communist Party daily Pravda said that during a Tuesday
rally in Yerevan's Theater Square, someone began calling for a
blockade of Zvartnots Airport, and that a large column of people
headed toward it on foot.
   Pravda said planes were allowed to land, but that demonstrators
``grossly disrupted order'' and prevented them from taking off
again. Hundreds of passengers were stranded, it said.
   The evening television news program ``Vremya'' said 3,000 people
took part in the protest, and that 60 flights were grounded along
with 14,000 passengers.
   Perfilyev told the Tass news agency that more than 400 people
swarmed into the airport's terminal, while another 1,500 gathered
outside.
   He said the demonstrators impeded the sale of tickets and the
collection of luggage, ventured onto the landing strip, stopped
passengers from entering the terminal, and paralyzed the work of
the airport dispatcher.
   For an hour, internal security troops with bullhorns ordered the
protesters to leave, then intervened to evict them. ``They were
forced out, but there were no clashes or fights,'' Perfilyev said.
   Protesters then began hurling rocks and bottles, and 36 people
``had to seek medical assistance,'' Perfiliyev said.
   The government daily Izvestia said the demonstrators demanded
that the airport staff shut down operations.
   ``An intervention by the forces of order became necessary,'' the
paper said. `Unfortunately, in the clashes that ensued, some
violators of law and order suffered, as well as several
policemen.'' It gave no further details.
   Armenian activists in Moscow, however, said witnesses had
telephoned them from Yerevan to say that army troops carrying
machine guns and backed by tanks had begun firing without warning
on the protesters.
   ``All of a sudden, they started shooting,'' artist Kuryun G.
Nagapetyan told about 50 people who gathered for an evening rally
outside Moscow's red-brick Armenian church. ``They were carrying
clubs, like policemen in the West, and they beat people right and
left.''
   Three students were killed when ``officers shot them with
pistols,'' Nagapetyan said. He said 37 other people reportedly were
hospitalized.
   Alexei Mananikov, an editor of the unofficial Moscow journal
Glasnost, said Khachik Kazaryan, 22, was killed in a confrontation
between protesters and soldiers at the airport.
   He said sources in Yerevan told him that as many as 40 people
had been wounded by soldiers trying to reopen the airport.
   Lev. G. Gambaryan, another Armenian who lives in Moscow, told
the rally that reports from Yerevan on Wednesday indicated two
children, age 6 and 10, had also died of gunshot wounds. But he and
Nagapetyan said it was not certain whether the two reported deaths
were new or among the three previously reported.
   Gambaryan said the soldiers numbered about 100, and were members
of an elite parachute detachment from the regular army, and not
troops under the command of the Interior Ministry.
   Nagapetyan blamed ``provocateurs'' brought in from Azerbaijan
for launching the call to go to the airport. He said Armenians were
swayed by them because they believed planes were ferrying in
paratroopers, tanks and machine guns to quash their protests.
   Ethnic Armenians, who predominate in Nagorno-Karabakh, demand
that the mountainous region be taken away from Azerbaijan and given
to Armenia. Armenia supports the demand, but Azerbaijan has
rejected it and the issue has gone to officials in Moscow.
   In February, rioting erupted in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait.
Officials say 32 people _ 26 Armenians and six Azerbaijanis _ were
killed. The area has been tense ever since, with periodic
widespread strikes.
   At the news conference, Perfilyev said a man had been hurt as a
result of ``hooliganism'' in the town of Masis, about six miles
from Yerevan, and died after being hospitalized. ``But this has
nothing to do with events at the airport,'' he said.
   A general strike began in Yerevan on Monday following a large
meeting the day before on the city's main square, newspapers
reported Tuesday.
   Activists met Sunday with delegates to the Communist Party
conference that ended Friday in Moscow. Apparently dissatisfied
with the Armenian delegation's presentation of the dispute over
Nagorno-Karabakh, they called a strike.
   ``Vremya'' said hundreds of thousands of Armenians thronged
Yerevan's streets Wednesday as a general strike begun Monday
continued.
   Izvestia said mass transit was still shut down and that the
situation Wednesday was worse than the previous day, when 26
factories and economic agencies in the Caucasus republic were idled.

   Joan Kennedy, former wife of U.S. Sen
Edward Kennedy, pleaded innocent Wednesday in Barnstable District
Court to charges of drunken driving, according to a court official.
   Attorney Patrick Butler issued the plea on behalf of Mrs.
Kennedy, who did not appear in court, said Clerk-Magistrate Omer
Chartrand. A hearing was scheduled for Aug. 5, he said.
   Mrs. Kennedy, 51, was arrested for drunken driving by
Centerville police after she drove into a chain-link fence along a
road near the beach shortly after 8 p.m. Tuesday, according to Lt.
William Arthur.
   Mrs. Kennedy was not injured in the accident, he said. The car,
a 1985 Buick, was towed and impounded by police.
   Several years ago Mrs. Kennedy, an Alcoholics Anonymous member,
hired author Marcia Chellis, also a recovering alcoholic, to write
the book, ``Living With the Kennedys: The Joan Kennedy Story.''
   But Mrs. Kennedy later criticized the biography, saying she felt
it betrayed the confidentiality of Alcoholics Anonymous by
mentioning other members.
   The book describes Mrs. Kennedy as an outsider who was
overwhelmed by the pressures put on the Kennedy family. Mrs.
Kennedy, who lives mostly in Boston, was divorced in late 1983.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis, meeting with his fourth
prospective running mate in three days, interviewed Indiana Rep.
Lee Hamilton Wednesday in what Hamilton called a ``very relaxed''
session. The congressman said he'd accept if asked.
   Dukakis also met with civil rights leaders as part of his
continuing effort to expand his support among blacks. Among 20
national and local black leaders at the meeting were NAACP
executive director Benjamin Hooks, National Urban League President
John Jacob, the Rev. Joseph Lowery of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference and Coretta Scott King, the widow of Martin
Luther King Jr.
   Still later, Dukakis was to address the Greek Orthodox
Ecumenical Congress, which was holding its convention in Boston.
The likely Republican nominee, Vice President George Bush, was to
address the same group on Thursday.
   Hamilton was the eighth man interviewed by the all-but-certain
Democratic nominee as part of the search for a vice presidential
running mate. One of the eight, Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn, has said he
is not interested.
   After a 50-minute meeting with Dukakis at the Massachusetts
Statehouse, Hamilton fired back a quick ``Yes'' when asked if he
would accept the vice presidential nomination.
   ``I would accept it, first of all, if he thinks I can be
helpful,'' the Indiana Democrat added.
   Hamilton said he had a ``very relaxed and wide-ranging
discussion'' with Dukakis, with the main topics being the vice
presidency and foreign policy.
   Others being considered for the No. 2 spot on the ticket are
Jesse Jackson, Sens. Albert Gore of Tennessee, John Glenn of Ohio,
Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and Bob Graham of Florida, and Rep. Richard
Gephardt of Missouri.
   Dukakis dined with Jackson Monday night and met with Gore and
Gephardt on Tuesday. He interviewed the others in Washington last
week.
   Paul Brountas, Dukakis' campaign chairman, was to remain in
Washington through Friday, gathering information on the contenders
and talking with party leaders.
   The meeting with the civil rights leaders was described by
participants as upbeat and more substantive than a recent session
the same group had with Bush. Members of the black delegation said
they were particularly pleased with Dukakis' pledge to make full
employment a priority.
   ``I cannot recall an issue he disagreed with us on,'' Hooks said.
   Whether blacks will support Dukakis without Jackson on the
ticket is largely up to Jackson. Hooks said. ``I think that they
basically will follow, though some will be disappointed, (they)
will follow his leadership,'' he said.
   Dukakis, in addition to his political chores, also had several
meetings Wednesday on state-related business, including his effort
to balance the budget for the fiscal year that ended last week and
to draft a balanced budget for the new fiscal year.
   Bush had a surrogate invade Dukakis' home turf Wednesday to
criticize a Massachusetts furlough program that allowed the release
of a first-degree murderer who then escaped and raped a Maryland
woman.
   But the surrogate, Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter, was ambushed
by Dukakis supporters, including Sen. John F. Kerry, the state's
current and former attorney general, several county prosecutors and
several police chiefs.
   Specter said Bush was a tougher crimefighter than Dukakis and
said the governor's support of the furlough program even after the
Maryland incident ``raises a question as to his overall judgment.''
   However, Kerry stepped in to defend Dukakis and said Bush has
been a failure as the leader of the Reagan administration's
anti-crime and anti-drug efforts.
   Kerry, D-Mass., said the Specter appearance in Boston the day
after Attorney General Edwin Meese III announced he was resigning
was designed to ``hide the reality of what the Justice Department
of Ronald Reagan and George Bush has not done, or what they have
done.''

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III says his
legal fees for the first 7{ months of an independent counsel's
investigation may run as high as $250,000, an amount which the
government may have to pay.
   On his financial disclosure form for 1987, issued this week,
Meese listed his legal fees to the Washington law firm of Miller,
Cassidy, Larroca & Lewin as a liability in the range of $100,000 to
$250,000. Two lawyers in the firm continue to represent Meese, who
was under investigation from May 11, 1987 until Tuesday by
independent counsel James McKay.
   McKay ended his probe by filing an 830-page report with the
panel of federal appeals court judges which appointed him, an act
which signifies that Meese won't be indicted. Meese announced
Tuesday that he was resigning, effective later this summer.
   Under the Ethics in Government Act, Meese may apply for federal
payment of his legal fees, and Meese did so in a previous
independent counsel investigation of his activities in 1984. The
law provides for reimbursement of fees incurred by public officials
who aren't indicted in criminal investigations conducted by an
independent counsel.
   It is unclear whether Meese has been making payments to his
lawyers, Nathan Lewin and James Rocap.
   Rocap declined to discuss the financial arrangements in his and
Lewin's representation of Meese.
   Three years ago, the appeals court judges awarded Meese almost
two-thirds of the $720,824 he sought to pay his legal bills in the
investigation of his activities by independent counsel Jacob Stein,
who determined that Meese had committed no indictable offenses
while he was President Reagan's counselor.
   Of the $472,190 award, $357,515 represented legal fees for
services provided by Leonard Garment, who is with the firm of
Dickstein, Shapiro & Morin.
   A total of $37,805 was awarded in expenses incurred by Garment's
firm, and $76,870 was determined as the total of legal fees to be
paid to the other lawyer in the case, longtime Meese friend E.
Robert Wallach. Wallach is now under indictment in the Wedtech
scandal and it was Wallach's close ties to Meese that triggered the
latest independent counsel probe.

<TEXT>
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has struck
out in its initial effort to sell nearly $1 billion in bad loans
acquired in the largest-ever government bank bailout, officials
said Wednesday.
   Steven Seelig, associate director of the FDIC's division of
liquidation, said a plan approved by the FDIC board in February to
publicly offer the loans from Continental Illinois Corp. in six
large portfolios failed, but he said efforts would begin
immediately to sell the loans in smaller packages.
   In the unprecedented bailout, the FDIC in 1984 pumped $4.5
billion _ $3.5 billion of it borrowed from the Federal Reserve
System _ into the Chicago-based bank to prevent the failure of what
was then the nation's seventh-largest bank.
   As part of the rescue, the FDIC, which insures accounts in
commercial banks up to $100,000, took over many of Continental
Illinois' problem loans and acquired ownership of the bank's stock.
It expects to recoup all but $1.7 billion of the bailout money by
selling the loans and the stock.
   Seelig told the FDIC board that the agency staff attempted to
sell the last of the non-performing loans, originally worth $865
million, for a minimum of $299 million.
   Despite 274 expressions of interest, Seelig said, the FDIC found
only 17 bidders financially qualified to buy the loans. Only five
of those actually submitted bids, all of which were too low.
   ``The market for large, complex, troubled credit is thin and
requires sophisticated buyers,'' he said.
   Some of the potential buyers were looking to make a quick profit
by buying the loans cheap and immediately reselling them, rather
than holding the loans and working on collections, Seelig said.
   However, he said the five-month effort to market the loans in
large groups turned up investors who could buy smaller batches at
the FDIC's asking price.
   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman, noting a September 1989
deadline for repayment of the Federal Reserve's $3.5 billion loan,
said, ``I hope you can move ahead with all deliberate speed.''

<HEAD>Moody Pulls From Senate Race; Angers Some Democrats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Jim Moody withdrew from the Democratic
primary for U.S. Senate on Wednesday, saying he could not compete
against millionaire Herbert Kohl to be the successor to William
Proxmire, who is retiring.
   The deicison by Moody, who said he would seek re-election to his
5th District seat, angered some fellow Democrats who had planned
their political futures based on his Senate candidacy.
   Former state Democratic Party Chairman Matthew J. Flynn said he
would stay in the congressional race despite Moody's decision. At
least four other Democrats had entered the race, but some said they
might now reconsider.
   Moody's announcement came three days after a Milwaukee Journal
poll showed him well behind former Gov. Anthony Earl and Kohl in
the race for the Democratic nomination, to be decided at a primary
election Sept. 13.
   The survey showed Earl leading among likely voters with 31
percent, while Kohl had 28 percent and Moody 12 percent. Former
deputy Wisconsin Attorney General Edward R. Garvey also had 12
percent while Secretary of State Douglas J. La Follette had 8
percent.
   ``Money is now determining this Senate race. I was faced with
the reality of wiping out my life savings and going deeply into
debt and that would still not be enough,'' Moody said.
   Kohl, who owns professional basketball's Milwaukee Bucks,
dismissed the notion that his wealth had forced Moody from the
race. ``To say that people of Wisconsin can be bought is something
that I've never considered,'' Kohl said. ``A messenger without a
message can't win.''
   Kohl, heir to a supermarket fortune, is a former state
Democratic chairman but has never held elective public office.
   Moody should have little difficulty getting the necessary
signatures on petitions to qualify for a House candidacy by the
July 12 deadline, said campaign manager Michael Elconin.

   A small British television production firm said
Wednesday it is buying MTM, the production company co-founded by
actress Mary Tyler Moore, in what both described as a move to tune
into each other's markets.
   The independent Television South PLC will pay $320 million for
the U.S. firm known for quality series such as ``St. Elsewhere''
and ``Hill Street Blues,'' which have large followings in Europe
although they are out of production.
   TVS Chief Executive James Gatward told reporters that MTM ``had
a very long desire to come to Europe ... I needed to create an
entity in the States, so we came together.''
   MTM, founded in 1970, takes its name from Miss Moore's initials.
   ``I'm very excited about it. I think it's a great opportunity
for MTM to grow, especially in the European market,'' Miss Moore
told a news conference in Beverly Hills, Calif.
   ``I'm thrilled with the kind of production TVS has given us in
the past and I think it's just a natural coupling of these two
companies,'' she said.
   Executives from both firms denied the purchase meant the end of
MTM Entertainment Inc.'s creative heyday, saying the British firm
won't interfere with MTM's award-winning style.
   ``We don't look on this as an acquisition, we see it as a
merger,'' Bob Klosterman, financial vice president of the private
Los Angeles-based MTM, told The Associated Press after a news
conference to announce the purchase.
   ``They don't intend to come over and tell us how to do it, no
more than we intend to do the same,'' he said.
   TVS says it is Britain's fourth-largest independent company in
terms of advertising revenue, and fifth-largest in population
reached. However, although it blankets southern England, the most
prosperous area of Britain, it is not among the top five companies
that dictate commercial network schedules.
   It says buying MTM will make it Britain's largest independent TV
company.
   TVS productions are aired by Independent Television and Channel
4, Britain's two national commercial channels. The non-commercial
British Broadcasting Corp. runs the other two channels.
   TVS said it will finance the deal by issuing $77.7 million in
shares, then raising $242 million in cash by offering $82 million
in convertible preference shares and borrowing $65 million.
   Two French companies, the Canal and S.A. pay television firm,
and the Generale D'Images S.A. communications group, will pay a
total of $99 million for shares in return for a 10 percent stake
each.
   Through the purchase, TVS becomes TVS Entertainment PLC and
gains MTM's library of productions worth $310 million, along with
its U.S. distribution network.
   MTM's pre-tax profits for the year ending in May were $43
million, up from $41 million the previous year.
   Klosterman said the purchase arose after MTM planned a share
flotation last year ``to get our feet wet and then come into the
foreign market'' but was withdrawn after the October crash.
   Gatward said TVS plans to co-produce one series a year, such as
a proposed project to be set in France starring British and
American actors. Most programs will be produced separately, he said.

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court on Wednesday upheld
the racketeering convictions of 10 members of a neo-Nazi group for
actions that included murdering a Jewish talk-show host and
stealing $4 million to finance a racist revolution.
   By a 3-0 vote, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a
variety of defense challenges to the convictions of members of a
group called The Order.
   A federal jury in Seattle found the members guilty in December
1985 of racketeering and conspiracy charges in a campaign to
overthrow the U.S. government.
   Among the acts that made up the racketeering charge were the
1984 machine-gun slaying the next month of Alan Berg, a Denver
radio host who had criticized racist groups; and holdups of armored
trucks that netted $535,000 in Seattle in April 1984 and $3.8
million in Ukiah, Calif., in July 1984.
   The group's founder, Robert Mathews, died in December 1984 when
a flare fired by FBI agents during a gun battle set fire to his
cottage in Whidbey Island, Wash. Members of the group were arrested
over the next few months in 13 states.
   The 10 convicted in Seattle were sentenced to 40 years in prison
for racketeering and conspiracy, with additional years for other
individual crimes. Twelve other members pleaded guilty.
   In addition, Bruce Pierce, identified by authorities as Mathews'
successor, and fellow member David Eden Lane have been convicted in
a Colorado federal court on federal charges related to Berg's
murder.
   In Wednesday's ruling, the court rejected arguments by Pierce
and Lane that the inclusion of the murder allegations in the
racketeering charges deprived them of their constitutional right to
testify in their own defense, because the testimony could be used
against them in a possible future murder case in state court.
   The two men were faced with the same ``difficult choice'' that
is required of any defendant who might face a later, related
prosecution in state court, said the opinion by Judge Charles
Wiggins. He said their decision on whether to testify was not
coerced by the government.
   Wiggins also said the consecutive 20-year sentences for
racketeering and conspiracy were within constitutional bounds,
``given the enormity of the crime.''
   On another issue, Wiggins said the prosecutor acted improperly
when he used a display board to write a summary of the evidence
while questioning one defendant _ with the first letter of each
word spelling out ``GUILTY'' _ but said the error was harmless in
light of the overwhelming evidence in the case.

   U.S. military leaders changed their minds and
decided the downed Iranian aircraft was a jetliner rather than an
F-14 fighter because an analysis of intelligence data showed an
A300 Airbus was in the water and no Iranian warplanes were aloft at
the time, sources said Wednesday.
   Immediately after the Persian Gulf incident, which took place on
Sunday at 2:51 a.m. EDT, Iran claimed that the United States had
shot down Iran Air flight 655 with 290 people aboard.
   Within hours, the Pentagon issued a statement saying that the
``USS Vincennes ... reported it downed an Iranian F-14 aircraft
that was approaching in a hostile manner'' after the Vincennes and
another American warship had fought off an attack by Iranian
gunboats.
   As the rest of the world grappled to make sense of these
conflicting assessments Sunday morning, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
assembled in the Pentagon and sifted through the evidence.
   ``Intelligence data was coming in and it showed that there were
no F-14s operating in the area,'' said one source, who like others
demanded anonymity.
   The biggest piece of evidence was the wreckage of the Airbus and
efforts by Iranian vessels, aircraft and divers to recover the
bodies, according to public statements released since the incident
and interviews with administration sources.
   Additionally, U.S. military officials determined that no Iranian
F-14s had been operating in the area. This led the Pentagon to
conclude that the downed aircraft was the airliner, as claimed by
Iran.
   This new conclusion was announced by the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs, Adm. William Crowe, who appeared at a hastily called
Pentagon news conference at 1:30 p.m. EDT Sunday. Crowe announced
that the Vincennes had indeed shot down a civilian airliner rather
than an F-14 fighter.
   Six investigators, headed by Rear Adm. William M. Fogarty,
arrived in the gulf on Wednesday to interview the skipper of the
Vincennes, Capt. Will C. Rogers III, and plumb the electronic
innards of the ship's sophisticated Aegis radar and tracking system.
   Much of the intelligence that led the Pentagon and field
commanders to determine that the plane was an airliner and not a
fighter was not available to Rogers when he fired two SM-2 Standard
missiles at the Iranian aircraft, officials said.
   The intelligence collected after the incident included radio
signals from airplanes and ground stations plus a limited and not
always reliable network of informers on the ground, said one source.
   ``This type of information takes a little time to decode and
sift through, and was not immediately available to Rogers'' or
other American commanders in the gulf, said the source.
   In the hours after the airliner went down, that information was
fed to the local commander of U.S. forces in the gulf, Rear Adm.
Anthony Less, aboard his flagship, the USS Coronado, which is based
at Bahrain in the gulf.
   Less was in radio contact with Rogers aboard the Vincennes, and
authorized him to fire the Standards when the Airbus was 20 miles
away. Rogers waited until the plane was nine miles away, officials
said.
   During the incident and afterward, Less was in radio contact
with headquarters for American forces in the Persian Gulf, the U.S.
Central Command at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla., which in
turn was in radio contact with the Pentagon.
   Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard told reporters Tuesday that the
conclusion that the plane was an airliner ``was reached in concert.
Communications were back and forth through Centcom (Central
Command) and it was reached in concert and conjunction with Centcom
and with the information we were receiving from the area.''
   The process of sifting through the information and determining
exactly what happened will be the responsibility primarily of the
investigating team headed by Fogarty. It is expected to complete
its report in two or three weeks, Howard said.

   Sales of the Suzuki Samurai plunged 70.6 percent
in June from a year earlier, the automaker said Wednesday in its
first sales report since Consumers Union charged that the vehicle
tips over too easily.
   American Suzuki Motor Corp. said it sold 2,199 Samurais in June,
down from 7,479 in June 1987.
   June's sales were the lowest since December 1985, the month
after the car's U.S. introduction. Sales had been running at more
than 6,000 a month from March through May.
   The dramatic decline demonstrated the influence of Consumers
Union as well as the impact of television news, which showed clips
of the Samurai tipping over onto its outriggers in test runs.
   Suzuki said it was not surprised by the decline and expected
sales to increase in coming months. A spokesman said ``Suzuki
continued to express absolute confidence in the safety of the
Samurai.''
   Asked for comment, Consumers Union spokesman David Berliner
said, ``If it is a reflection in any way of the public giving
credence to our findings, then I think that is a good sign.''
   Consumers Union, the non-profit publisher of Consumer Reports
magazine based in Mount Vernon, has said Suzuki should recall the
vehicle and give refunds to owners.
   Consumers Union said June 2 that the Samurai tends to roll over
when the driver swerves to avoid an accident. It gave the vehicle
its first ``not acceptable'' rating in 10 years.
   Suzuki said Consumers Union's testing procedures ``biased and
completely inaccurate.''
   Suzuki is ``not at this time planning on withdrawing'' the
Samurai from the market in response to the poor June sales, said
Rob Cahn, a representative of the company's public relations
agency, Rogers & Associates. He said that had been the company's
position from the beginning.
   The Samurai passed the ordinary Consumers Union test. It flunked
only when the obstacle course was made more challenging.
   The four-wheel-drive Samurai has a high center of gravity, a
narrow tread width, a short wheelbase and light weight. Consumers
Union said that combination made the vehicle inherently flawed, but
Suzuki said the design was sound and cited statistics showing the
Samurai had a good safety record.
   Suzuki said almost any vehicle can be made to tip over, but
television highlights of the Samurai test runs apparently unnerved
many potential customers.
   For the first six months of 1988, Samurai sales were down to
31,221 from 42,912 a year earlier, according to American Suzuki,
the Brea, Calif.-based subsidiary of Japan's Suzuki Motor Co. Ltd.
   The boxy Samurai became a best-seller almost immediately after
its introduction in the United States in November 1985, taking some
business away from larger and more expensive cousins, such as the
Jeep Wrangler, Jeep Cherokee and Isuzu Trooper II.
   Sales had already begun to slow down from their torrid 1987 pace
earlier this year, in part because of allegations by the Center for
Auto Safety about the Samurai's propensity to roll over.

   A coalition of women activists on Wednesday
said they will press the presidential candidates to appoint more
women to executive positions in the new administration.
   Although not an echo of the 1984 clamor for a woman vice
presidential candidate, the Coalition for Women's Appointments will
conduct a bipartisan effort to recruit and recommend qualified
women for presidential appointments, said Irene Natividad,
chairwoman of the National Women's Political Caucus.
   Too often, men have voiced a ``we-can't-find-any syndrome,''
said Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., co-chairman of Vice President George
Bush's presidential campaign.
   She and other participants in a news conference said the goal of
about 50 women's groups in the coalition is to counter that
syndrome by making known the names and resumes of women who have
qualifications for high government posts.
   Others who spoke at the news conference were Rep. Barbara
Kennelly, D-Conn., representing the campaign of Democrat Michael
Dukakis; Eleanor Holmes Norton, a key adviser in the campaign of
Jesse Jackson, who finished second to Dukakis in the Democratic
primaries; and Barbara Blum, former Environmental Protection Agency
official under President Carter.
   The women spoke about the much touted ``gender gap'' showing
that women increasingly have provided a margin of victory for
Democrats in key races, and, according to recent polls, support
Bush in far fewer numbers than men.
   ``We're looking beyond the campaign to show the next
administration that the gender gap does more than deliver votes;
it's also bulging with talent,'' said Natividad.
   Natividad said the Reagan years have seen a slowdown in
appointments of women to key posts. He appointed 54 during his
first term, two of them to cabinet-level posts, compared to 72
appointed by President Carter, with four cabinet members.
   ``This slowdown during the Reagan administration has occurred
despite continuing gains by women in both the private sector and in
elective office ... On the state level, the number of women
appointed to high level positions nearly doubled between 1981 and
1987.''
   The women noted the drumbeat for a woman running mate has been
muted this year compared to 1984 when Democrat Walter Mondale was
nudged into choosing a woman running mate in part by the sheer
fervor in favor of such a move.
   Martin said that the first woman elected president or vice
president will have to be ``perfect or pretty doggone close''
because of the grilling she will undergo.
   Kennelly said many feminists agreed that a woman selected for
vice president should have been a presidential candidate first.
Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., abandoned this year's
presidential race before formally entering it.

<HEAD>``Sleaze Factor'' Less for Bush After Meese Resigns, Pollster Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   White House pollster Richard Wirthlin said
Wednesday the resignation of Attorney General Edwin Meese III
doesn't erase the ``sleaze factor'' for Vice President George Bush
in the fall presidential campaign, but makes it easier for him to
deal with it.
   During a luncheon session with reporters, Wirthlin said only
about 3 percent of the voters he has surveyed cite ethics in
government as the most important issue, a figure that is no higher
than a year earlier.
   The issue that outstrips all others in importance in the minds
of voters is drugs, said the pollster.
   ``There are now 21 percent who tag drugs as the single most
important problem facing the nation,'' he said. No other issue was
named by more than 10 percent of people interviewed.
   ``I think Bush is still going to have to address the `sleaze
factor,''' said Wirthlin when asked about the impact of Meese's
decision to leave the Cabinet.
   For months, while Meese was under investigation by independent
counsel James McKay, Bush was peppered with questions about whether
he thought the attorney general should resign. Bush aides, at one
point, described Meese as a ``liability,'' a description the vice
president disavowed.
   Wirthlin said the departure of Meese would put the ethics issue
``in a different context'' and would ``enable Bush to talk about
ethics without implicitly criticizing Ed Meese.''
   For more than 20 years, Wirthlin has done polling for Ronald
Reagan, beginning when Reagan was governor of California and
continuing through three presidential campaigns.
   During the 1988 primaries, Wirthlin polled for Sen. Bob Dole of
Kansas during his unsuccessful race against Bush for the GOP
presidential nomination.
   Wirthlin said that Democrat Michael Dukakis will have an
opportunity to open a wide lead right after the Democratic National
Convention in July and that the Republicans should plan ``some kind
of major event'' to gain attention.
   He suggested the best Bush tactic would be to name his running
mate during the week following the Democratic convention.
   On the question of running mates, Wirthlin said Sen. John Glenn
of Ohio would be ``far and away the best pick on the Democratic
side.'' He said the picture wasn't clear on the Republican side,
but he named Dole and his wife, Elizabeth, as bringing strength to
the ticket as well as Gov. Jim Thompson of Illinois and former Gov.
Richard Thornburgh of Pennsylvania.
   Wirthlin also said he thought it would be a mistake to have
President Reagan on the stump attacking Dukakis.
   ``People do not approve of an incumbent president attacking a
candidate trying to succeed him,'' he said.
   In addition, he said, Reagan ``is not a good attack candidate.''

   Police said Wednesday they had no
motive for the death of a businessman in a plunge from the roof of
the 28-story Gulf Life Tower into its lobby.
   Investigators considered the Tuesday afternoon death of a man
they identified as Russell Paul Ginch, 31, a suicide, said police
spokesman Asa Higgs.
   Ginch, dressed in a business suit, apparently jumped from the
roof, fell through a second-floor lobby roof, landed on an
escalator and rolled onto the floor near the building's main
entrance.
   Ed Nichols, a trainer at a gym on the tower's top floor, said he
became suspicious after seeing the man walk through a weight room
onto a sundeck. Nichols followed the man a short time later, but
couldn't find him.
   ``I was up there in a few minutes ... and he was gone,'' Nichols
said.
   Investigators said the man apparently used electrical boxes to
climb 20 feet up from the deck. He then walked along a beam on the
roof to the front of the building and jumped.
   No one else was injured, although several people were nearby,
Higgs said.
   Building officials said they didn't recognize the man as a
tenant or employee in the building, headquarters for an insurance
holding company. Police were trying to find his relatives, friends
or employers, Higgs said.

   The unanswered questions remaining about the
Iranian Airbus destroyed by an American missile have given rise to
some bizarre theories about the downing of the plane.
   Those television images of bloated bodies floating in the
Persian Gulf fuel speculation but no answers.
   On television, the bodies appeared to be nude and to be so
bloated as to suggest they were in the water for some time. How
come?
   How did the Iranians have a television camera in place to
capture what Iranian televisision said were shots of the plane at
the moment it was hit? (To the viewer, the plane was a mere dot on
the screen and the pictures were too grainy to lead to that
conclusion.)
   No American official has publicly suggested that Iran's
revolutionary government deliberately sent civilians on Iran Air
flight 655 to their death, but terrorism expert Robert Kupperman
said he had heard ``a few people in the Pentagon'' advance such
theories.
   ``I don't give much credence to it personally,'' said Kupperman,
a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, a think tank. ``I don't believe that anybody is going to
be able to prove that this has been a set-up.''
   Neil C. Livingstone, a conservative expert on terrorism, said
there are ``some real strange questions'' about the incident,
citing television footage provided by the Iranians.
   ``It's very hard to explain why someone would be taking pictures
of a plane flying in the gulf,'' Livingstone said.
   Dr. Charles Ruehle, the former commander of the Armed Forces
Institute of Medical Pathology, said finding floating, bloated
bodies within a short time would not be unusual after a crash into
warm, salty water.
   The gulf's sea surface temperature averages about 89 degress
Fahrenheit and the salinity is higher than in the Atlantic Ocean
off the Florida coast.
   Ruehle said he was puzzled by why the bodies appeared to be
nude. ``In my experience, there has been nothing that would explain
that,'' he said.
   The experts, however, all said there is not enough available
information to evaluate exactly what happened.
   Gary Sick, a Columbia University professor and a National
Security Council aide under President Carter, said he began to hear
people suggest ``within hours'' of Sunday's attack that the Airbus
had taunted the Navy warship Vincennes on purpose.
   ``It is an easy explanation that takes the United States off the
hook for having shot the plane down,'' Sick said. At present, the
evidence does not justify that conclusion, he said.

<HEAD>Britain Says Compensation Agreed with Iran, But No Hostage Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain on Wednesday announced an agreement with
Iran to pay for damage to each other's embassies in violent
incidents, but insisted it made no ``sordid deal'' to secure the
release of Britons held hostage in Lebanon.
   David Mellor, a junior minister at the Foreign Office, also said
Britain was ``more than willing'' to improve its chilly elations
with Iran, but added ``it has to be in relation to legitimate
things.''
   ``What we are not prepared to do is get involved in any sort of
sordid deal _ trading for hostages, that sort of thing,'' Mellor
said in a radio interview after the announcement.
   ``But if they want to do business of the kind we've just
concluded today, then I think that is in everybody's interest. ...
We would like to have sensible relations with Iran.''
   Iran's sole diplomat in London said the agreement was a
``technical matter.''
   ``We are following a principled position that we are accepting a
kind of normal, businesslike relationship,'' Charge d'Affaires
Mohammed Basti told reporters.
   Britain seeks the release of three of its nationals believed
held by pro-Iranian Islamic fundamentalists in Beirut. They are
Anglican church envoy Terry Waite, journalist John McCarthy and
teacher Brian Keenan. Keenan holds both British and Irish
nationality and the Irish government also seeks his release.
   The Foreign Office says it also seeks word on Alec Collett, a
New York-based British journalist whose Palestinian abductors claim
they killed him. His body was never found.
   They are among 18 foreign hostages held in Beirut, including
nine Americans. Longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was abducted March 16,
1985.
   Wednesday's agreement followed several weeks of negotiations
that Britain says Iran initiated ``out of the blue'' on a
compensation offer first made in 1984.
   The agreement came just two days after Basti protested to the
Foreign Office about Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's refusal to
condemn the U.S. downing of an Iranian passenger jet on Sunday in
the Persian Gulf.
   The U.S. Navy said it mistook the civilian Airbus A300 for an
Iranian F-14 fighter. All 290 people aboard the plane died.
   Wednesday's agreement calls for Britain to pay Iran $3 million
in three installments to fix the Iranian Embassy in west London's
Kensington district. Britain also will settle a $340,000 bill from
the local municipal authority for shoring up the building.
   British commandos stormed the Iranian Embassy in 1980 to rescue
hostages held by opponents of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   Iran will pay Britain $1.67 million for damage to the British
Embassy and affiliated buildings in Tehran after the U.S. Embassy
and its staff were seized in November 1979.

   Only Japan among the world's industrial powers
bested the United States in reducing manufacturing labor costs in
absolute terms last year, the government said Wednesday.
   But measured in devalued U.S. dollars, labor costs in Japan
soared 13.5 percent campared with a 1.5 percent decline in the
United States, which had lower hourly increases in wages and
benefits than any of its nine largest industrial competitors, the
Labor Department said.
   ``Our competitiveness vis-a-vis our foreign trading partners is
definitely improving, especially after taking into account the
changes in exchange rates,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist for
the Boston Co., a New York consulting house. ``It's a step in the
right direction but we still have a long way to go.''
   U.S. manufacturers held hourly wage and benefit increases last
year to just 1.3 percent, compared with boosts of 1.4 percent in
Japan, 4.5 percent in Candada, 3.4 percent n France, 4 percent in
West Germany and 8.2 percent in Great Britain.
   But Japan improved its manufacturing productivity _ its
efficiency in churning out goods _ by 4.1 percent last year
compared with a 2.8 percent improvement in the United States, the
department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said.
   The higher Japanese productivity improvements combined with
relatively the same wage gains as in the United States reduced
Japanese labor costs for each product 2.5 percent, compared to the
1.5 percent decline in U.S. labor costs.
   France was the only other nation to reduce those labor costs in
absolute terms, by 0.2 percent. Unit labor costs all climbed in
Canada, Korea, Denmark, West Germany, Italy, Norway, Sweeden and
Great Britain.
   But after taking into account the 4.8 percent to 20.5 percent
increase in the value of foreign currencies agains the dollar, the
contrast in labor costs between the United States and its
competitors was much more dramatic.
   ``Adjusted for the sharp 1987 appreciations in foreign currency
values relative to the U.S. dollar, Japanese and European labor
costs rose about 13 percent to 25 percent,'' the Labor Department
said.
   Measured in dollars, labor costs rose 7.7 percent in Canada, 7.5
percent in Korea, 27.4 percent in Denmark, 14.9 percent in France,
23.9 percent in West Germany, 18 percent in Italy, 19 percent in
Norway, 17 percent in Sweeden and 13 percent in Great Britain.
   ``Thanks to our rising currency, many countries had to reduce
their output as a response to the tremendous rebound in our
manufacturing last year,'' said Sinai.
   ``But the decline in the industrial sectors of Japan, Great
Britain and West Germany has bottomed out and so has the dollar.
This year will not be a repeat of last,'' he warned.
   The Labor Department figures, in fact, showed that manufacturing
growth last year was slower in the United States than in Canada,
Korea, Italy and Great Britain.
   U.S. productivity improvements also were smaller than 4 percent
gains of Japan, France and Italy, 7 percent increase in Great
Britain and nearly 8 percent improvement in Norway.
   While five of the nine countries had larger 1987 productivity
increases than the United States, only Great Britain and Norway
exceeded the U.S. rate of improvement over the past two years, the
BLS said.
   However, only the United States and Canada experienced any
employment growth in manufacturing last year. The U.S. increase was
only one-half of 1 percent, but it reversed two straight years of
declines.
   Factory jobs remained abut the same in Germany and Sweeden and
fell by 1 percent to 2.5 percent in the other countries.
   For France, 1987 was the 13th consecutive year of manufacturing
employment declines and in Great Britain factory jobs have been
falling in number for the past 10 years.

   A baby born seven weeks prematurely aboard a cruise
ship in the Bahamas was picked up by a Coast Guard helicopter and
rushed to a hospital Wednesday, officials said.
   The 2-pound, 11-ounce girl was in serious but stable condition
at Miami Children's Hospital on Wednesday afternoon, said spokesman
Omar Montejo.
   ``All things considered, she's not doing badly,'' he said.
   The mother, Wylene McCollum, 23, was taken to Broward General
Medical Center in good condition, said that hospital's spokeswoman
Shana Safer.
   Mrs. McCollum, of Atlanta, was on a vacation cruise with her
husband, Spencer, also 23, when she went into labor, said Ms. Safer.
   The still unnamed baby was born aboard the Emerald Seas off
Little Stirrup Cay just after 10 a.m. The cruise liner makes a
regular run from Miami to the Bahamas.
   The Coast Guard in Miami rushed two H-65 Dolphin helicopters to
Children's Hospital, one to pick up the incubator and the second to
carry the medical team. The helicopters were met on Little Stirrup
Cay by a larger H-3 Pelican helicopter temporarily stationed by the
Coast Guard in the Bahamas.
   ``The baby was critical when we first arrived, but she improved
with the incubator,'' said Coast Guard spokesman Lt. Jim Mazzonna.
   The mother and baby were taken by boat from the ship to the
island, and everyone was put aboard the larger chopper, which flew
directly to Children's Hospital.
   Montejo said the baby's small size did not appear to be a
problem.

   The U.S. downing of an Iranian passenger plane
last Sunday seems certain to set back tentative efforts by the two
countries to have a more normal relationship, according to U.S.
officials and independent experts.
   Robin Wright, an associate at the Carnegie Endowment of
International Peace who recently visited Iran, said in an interview
Wednesday that Iran wants an opening to the West because of
economic hardship brought on by the prolonged war against Iraq as
well as declining oil prices.
   ``Iran clearly needs to open the door again,'' Wright said,
adding that after Iran's recent normalization of relations with
France, ``Britain is going to be next and then Canada.''
   She said that before last Sunday's incident, Iranian officials
sounded hopeful about the possibility of an eventual accommodation
with the United States.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said earlier this week that
before the airliner was shot down, Iranian officials had sent
messages through third parties indicating a desire to open a direct
dialogue with the United States.
   But Shultz said it is not clear whether the messages were sent
by officials in positions of authority.
   U.S. officials believe that the Iranian government may be
divided on the question of improved relations, with a some
supporting Iran's anti-U.S. Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi
and others rallying behind more moderate elements.
   State Department deputy spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said
Wednesday the United States is willing to open an ``authoritative
dialogue'' with Iran but U.S. efforts to explore this possibility
``have not borne fruit.''
   This has been a long-standing U.S. position, but received little
attention until the U.S. Navy warship Vincennes shot down the
Iranian passenger plane, killing all 290 persons aboard.
   In any case, Mrs. Oakley said there can be no normal
relationship with Iran so long as the Iran-Iraq war does not end,
American hostages continue to be held by pro-Iranian militants in
Lebanon, and Iran does not halt what she described as international
terrorist activities. For its part, Iran has called Sunday's
incident ``cold-blooded murder'' and an act of international
terrorism by the United States.
   Wright said that military incidents have repeatedly thwarted
fledgling efforts by the United States and Iran to improve
relations.
   As an example, she said that Iranian officials told her that
President Carter in the spring of 1980 expressed a willingness to
recognize Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution but shortly thereafter
approved a military mission to rescue the American hostages in
Tehran. The mission ended in failure.
   There have been reports that administration officials believed
that Iran might attempt to take advantage of the current U.S.
presidential campaign to advance its diplomatic goals.
   The Wall Street Journal reported on June 10 that Robert Oakley,
the National Security Council's Middle East expert, had written an
internal memo warning of that possibility.
   The article said that Oakley was concerned that Iran might try
to entice Vice President George Bush, the presumed Republican
candidate, into a deal involving the release of nine American
hostages in return for a less hostile stance toward Iran.
   There also has been speculation that Iran may be attempting to
spread word of its interest in improved ties with the United States
as a means of shaking the confidence of Iraq and its Arab allies in
the gulf.
   One of the prime purposes of the U.S. military deployment in the
gulf is to provide reassurance to Iran's neighbors, many of which
look upon Iran as an expansionist power.

   Gov. Robert Casey instructed state officials
Wednesday to seek maximum civil penalties and consider criminal
charges against Ashland Oil Inc. for a Jan. 2 fuel tank collapse
that polluted two major rivers in three states.
   The governor, following the recommendations of a task force
report that he released at a news conference, told the Department
of Environmental Resources to seek maximum civil damages against
Ashland. He declined to say how much the damages might total.
   Casey also asked the state attorney general to consider criminal
charges against the company, but said he would not recommend filing
charges against individuals.
   In U.S. District Court, meanwhile, Ashland promised in a consent
decree to pay $680,000 in federal cleanup expenses and to clean
contaminated soil and ground water at its Floreffe Terminal south
of Pittsburgh.
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which joined in the
consent decree, reserved the right to sue Ashland separately for
damages. An EPA spokesman in Philadelphia declined to say if the
agency would sue.
   Keith Welks, chief counsel of the state DER and head of the
governor's task force, said Ashland and its subcontractors
``displayed a pervasive pattern of neglect at virtually every
step'' in taking down an old steel-walled vessel at its Whiskey
Island terminal near Cleveland and reconstructing it in Floreffe.
   Among other things, Welks said the company failed to test the
toughness of the 40-year-old steel used in the tank, did not X-ray
enough welds on the reconstructed tank or repair defective welds
found, and did not test the reconstructed tank with water first.
   A critical dime-sized flaw in the steel, located near a weld,
probably would have been discovered had Ashland acted properly,
Welks said.
   ``In general we found that there was a failure of leadership by
Ashland,'' he said. ``Employees did not know what each other's
responsibilities were. They did not know what their own
responsibilities were.''
   Ashland officials said the state report largely duplicates its
own study.
   In a statement from its headquarters in Ashland, Ky., the
company expressed disappointment with the governor's decision and
said Ashland has paid $8.5 million so far in company and government
expenses, and in damages to individuals and businesses.
   ``We've been as open as we possibly can be,'' said Ashland
spokesman Roger Schrum.
   Casey asked the state Legislature for power to regulate
above-and below-ground fuel tanks.
   ``Voluntary industry standards do not adequately protect the
public,'' he said.
   The governor also urged the state Senate to remove from pending
toxic waste cleanup legislation what he called ``crippling,
anti-people, pro-polluter amendments'' that would exempt fuel tanks
from coverage.
   The above-ground tank at Floreffe burst minutes after the
company filled it with 3.9 million gallons of No. 2 fuel oil for
the first time since its reconstruction, the report said. The state
accepted previous findings that blamed the collapse on the flaw in
the metal, cold weather and the pressure of the fuel oil.
   The collapse spilled an estimated 511,000 gallons into the
Monongahela River, cutting off water service to 20,000 Pittsburgh
residents for a week.
   About 1 million other Pittsburgh residents were ordered to
conserve water until the oil passed their municipal water intakes.
Water supplies were affected similarly in Ohio and West Virginia
along the Ohio River, which joins the Monongahela at Pittsburgh.

   Republican George Bush promised he would name a
Hispanic-American to his Cabinet Wednesday as he sought minority
votes in Texas. Democrat Michael Dukakis searched for a running
mate and dealt with state budget deficits and other homefront
headaches.
   Bush also declared he would not apologize to Iran for the
shooting down of a jumbo jet with 290 people aboard.
   ``We probably ought to do what we did, which is to officially
express regret, which I guess should happen when you have the loss
of innocent life,'' the vice president told reporters.
   Dukakis, two weeks away from the Democratic presidential
nomination, continued to check out vice presidential prospects. He
interviewed Rep. Lee Hamilton of Indiana, a respected but
little-known congressman who was chairman of the House committee
that led the Iran-Contra investigation.
   Hamilton, the eighth man Dukakis has interviewed in his search,
said he would accept the No. 2 spot if offered.
   Dukakis senior aide Paul Brountas was in Washington through
Friday researching the contenders and talking to party leaders _
fueling speculation that a decision on a running mate would not
come until next week. Dukakis is to be in Washington next Wednesday
for more meetings.
   While attention focused on his search for a running mate, the
Massachusetts governor was plagued with an increasingly frustrating
budget dilemma and a new poll showing his popularity dropping at
home.
   The state government's new fiscal year began last Friday, and
Dukakis has yet to close a $450 million deficit for fiscal 1988 or
to sign a budget for the new year. He asked the Legislature for $81
million in emergency spending authority to cover state payroll and
welfare checks.
   A poll last week for WBZ-TV and The Boston Herald found Dukakis
leading Bush in the state by 14 percentage points. But it also
found 56 percent saying Dukakis has not been an effective governor
while campaigning for president and 47 percent saying he should
resign after the convention to devote his full time to the race.
   The poll, a survey of 400 Massachusetts voters conducted last
week by telephone, found Dukakis' unfavorable rating has more than
doubled, to 36 percent from 17 percent, since January 1987.
   Dukakis has already signed a new $40 million tax on cigarettes,
and more than $200 million in other new taxes are moving toward his
desk.
   Bush, preceding Dukakis by a day before a major Hispanic group
in Dallas, made the promise to name a Hispanic-American to his
Cabinet, calling it ``a pledge that I have never made before, to
anyone, to any group.''
   But he refused to make the same commitment to blacks, women or
other groups. ``Other groups have been represented in the Cabinet
and Hispanics have not. ... I'm addressing myself to righting a
wrong that has been out there for many years,'' he said.
   ``It is time. It is time and it's long overdue, and that is a
solemn pledge,'' Bush said.
   Bush addressed the annual convention of the League of United
Latin American Citizens, or LULAC, an umbrella organization of
Hispanic groups.
   Dukakis will speak to the group Thursday night at the first stop
on a swing that will take him to five Western states. He planned
appearances with one of his potential vice presidential candidates,
Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, in Texarkana, and with a former
presidential candidate, former Gov. Bruce Babbitt, in Arizona.
   Bush, talking to reporters aboard Air Force II on the way to
Texas, said it was too early to decide whether the United States
should pay compensation to the families of passengers killed in
Sunday's shooting down of an Iranian civilian jetliner.
   He said ``I wouldn't, because of the facts,'' offer an apology
to the Iranians _ even though President Reagan agreed that his own
statement of regret amounted to an apology.
   Jesse Jackson, still technically a presidential candidate
although Dukakis' nomination is assured, renewed his call for more
money to battle drugs while at an appearance in New York. He
stopped at a Harlem center providing treatment for infants born
addicted to heroin or other drugs.
   Jackson renewed his call for the United States to pay
compensation to the Iranian airliner victims and said there should
be a period of mourning showing ``sincere and clear and
unequivocal'' regret.
   Dukakis, in Boston, met with civil rights leaders including
NAACP executive director Benjamin Hooks and Coretta Scott King,
widow of Martin Luther King Jr.
   ``I cannot recall an issue he disagreed with us on,'' Hooks said.
   Dukakis also was addressing the Greek Orthodox Ecumenical
Congress, which was holding its convention in Boston. Dukakis is a
member of the Greek Orthodox church. Bush was planning to address
the group on Thursday.
   A surrogate campaigner for Bush, Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., held
a news conference at the Statehouse in Boston to attack Dukakis on
his home turf. He criticized as ``indefensible'' a Massachusetts
furlough program _ later amended _ that allowed the release of a
first-degree murderer who escaped and raped a Maryland woman.
   But Specter was upstaged by local supporters of Dukakis,
including Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, who stepped in to
defend Dukakis at the news conference and to say Bush had been a
failure in leading the Reagan administration's anti-drug efforts.

<HEAD>Soviet Official Sees No Similarity Between Airliner Downing And
KAL</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet military chief of staff, beginning
an unprecedented tour of U.S. military bases, said Wednesday he
didn't see any similarity between the downing of an Iranian
airliner last weekend and that of a Korean airliner by Soviet
forces in 1983.
   Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev told a Pentagon news conference
that he had discussed the incident with his U.S. counterpart and
host, Adm. William Crowe, but had refrained from offering any
advice.
   ``Yesterday, Adm. Crowe informed me about that, and he told me
about the specifics, and we took some time discussing this,'' said
Akhromeyev, speaking in Russian. ``I and Adm. Crowe are military
professionals and I did not see fit to offer any military advice.''
   ``I would not draw any similarities between the Iranian airliner
a few days ago and the downing of a Korean airliner a few years
ago,'' said Akhromeyev.
   Asked to explain the differences between the two incidents,
Akhromeyev smiled and said ``I believe you would be more interested
in the subjects we are discussing today'' as part of the continuing
dialogue between U.S. and Soviet armed forces.
   Crowe and others in the briefing room laughed as Akhromeyev
ducked the question, and the American admiral said a few minutes
later that he was ``looking forward to facing the Soviet press''
when he accepts the Soviet marshal's invitation to visit Moscow at
a later date.
   Crowe, at a grim news conference Sunday announcing that an U.S.
warship had shot down Iran Air flight 655 with 290 people aboard,
said there were ``fundamental differences'' between it and the
downing of Korean Air Lines flight 007 on Sept. 1, 1983.
   The key distinction, said Crowe, was that the Americans fired on
the Iranian jetliner in an area of combat, while the Soviets shot
down KAL 007 in an area free of hostilities.
   ``The fundamental differences, of course, are that it was not a
war zone,'' Crowe said of the KAL incident. ``There was not combat
in progress. There was not combat there normally'' over the Soviet
Kamchatka Penninsula, where KAL 007 was tracked by Soviet fighters
and shot down.
   During their talks Tuesday and Wednesday, said Akhromeyev, he
and Crowe agreed upon military exchanges in 1988 and 1989,
including visits by U.S. and Soviet warships to ports in the
other's country, and exchanges of military historians, senior
officers and delegations.
   The details remain to be worked out, but he mentioned as a
possible port of call for U.S. ships Leningrad, the Baltic Sea city
that is headquarters for the Soviet fleet.
   Akhromeyev also declined to spell out how the Soviets were
changing their force structure as part of a new military policy
they are advertising as a ``doctrine of reasonable sufficiency,''
which is supposed to be purely defensive.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci has expressed skepticism
about the new doctrine, following extensive conversations about it
with his Soviet counterpart, Defense Minister Gen. Dmitri Yazov.
Carlucci and Yazov met in Switzerland last March, again in Moscow
during the summit last month, and are to meet again in Moscow in
early August.
   Akhromeyev said he hoped to give convincing evidence about the
new doctrine on July 11, at a news conference at the close of his
visit to the United States.
   Akhromeyev brushed aside speculation that the Soviets might make
unilateral cuts in areas where they enjoy a significant edge, such
as tanks.
   ``Why should we do that unilaterally? We will discuss the
question in greater detail with Adm. Crowe later on'' during the
visit, said Akhromeyev.
   The Soviets have been pushing for an exchange of data as the
first step toward bilateral talks aimed at reducing conventional
forces in Europe.
   But the U.S. side has said that such reductions can only be made
in negotiations which include all the members of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization the Warsaw Pact, and expected to begin late
this year or in early 1989.
   Akhromeyev will visit several U.S. military installations during
his tour, becoming the top ranking Soviet officer to do so, at
least since the two nations were allies during World War II, said
Crowe.

   The Reagan administration has notified
Congress of its intention to sell Greece 1,000 Stinger
anti-aircraft missiles worth $124 million, the Pentagon said
Wednesday.
   The prime contractor for the handheld Stinger missiles will be
the General Dynamics Corp. Valley Systems Division of Rancho
Cucamonga, Calif.
   In addition to the missiles, the sale will include training and
training equipment, and devices known as ``identify friend or foe''
components to discern friendly from enemy aircraft, the
announcement said.
   Greece, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, will
``have no difficulty absorbing these systems into its armed
forces'' and the sale ``will have no adverse impact on U.S. defense
readiness,'' the Pentagon said in its announcement.

   Fighting flared between Palestinian
guerrillas in Beirut's Bourj el-Barajneh refugee camp Wednesday
after the collapse of Algerian-sponsored negotiations to end the
nine-week-old bloodletting.
   Police said loyalists of PLO chief Yasser Arafat traded mortar
and rocket fire with Syrian-backed rivals of Col. Saeed Mousa's
Fatah-Uprising breakaway faction after three Algerian envoys left
the camp.
   Two people were killed and 11 were wounded in the exchanges,
police said, bringing the overall toll to 160 killed and 629
wounded since fighting broke out on May 1 for control of Bourj
el-Barajneh and the nearby Chatilla camp.
   Chatilla fell to Fatah-Uprising guerrillas June 27, leaving
Bourj el-Barajneh as the Palestine Liberation Organization's last
stronghold in the Lebanese capital.
   The Algerians would not say why the talks failed, but a police
spokesman later explained that the dissidents insisted on
withdrawal of Arafat's followers from the shantytown.
   The policeman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Algerians were working on a formula for ``peaceful coexistence''
between the two sides.
   The negotiations had included Syrian army officers,
representatives from the two warring factions and other Palestinian
and leftist Lebanese groups. Mohammed Taher, a member of Algeria's
ruling National Liberation Front, led the Algerians.
   Taher told the dissidents before he and his team withdrew that
``Algeria will not sponsor the evacuation of Palestinians from
anywhere,'' the police spokesman reported. Algeria is a leading
Arab supporter of the Palestinian cause and the PLO.
   Neutral PLO factions also sided with the Algerians.
   The police spokesman had said earlier that the mediators were
discussing withdrawal of the remaining 100 guerrillas of Arafat's
mainstream Fatah faction from Bourj el-Barajneh to south Lebanon,
where the PLO has bases.
   Mousa broke with the PLO in 1983.
   Fatah officials said Mousa's gunners wrecked 80 percent of Bourj
el-Barajneh in the past two months. Only 3,000 of the camp's 20,000
residents remain inside.
   The loss of Chatilla and the weakened defensive position in
Bourj el-Barajneh are setbacks for Arafat, who has been trying to
rebuild his Lebanese power base since he was forced out of Beirut
when Israel invaded in 1982.
   A Fatah official in Bourj el-Barajneh, who also spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the Fatah guerrillas have ``accepted
the evacuation idea in principle but are demanding guarantees that
they will not be attacked when they leave the camp.''
   He said about 150 Fatah fighters have left the camp peacefully
since the latest bout of fighting erupted Monday.
   A Fatah-Uprising official known as Abu-Fadi Hammad said Arafat's
men would only be allowed to evacuate after they hand over their
weapons.
   The Algerians were to guarantee the safe conduct for Arafat's
withdrawing fighters. Fatah also asked that other PLO factions not
involved in the battles escort the guerrillas on the 25-mile trip
south to the Lebanese port city of Sidon.
   Mousa's forces have prevented Libyan mediators _ who played a
key role in evacuating Arafat's men from Chatilla after it fell _
from continuing their efforts, the Fatah official said. He said the
dissidents have banned 26 Libyan military observers from entering
Bourj el-Barajneh in the past few days.
   Libya has become one of Arafat's main allies and its leader,
Col. Moammar Gadhafi, has been trying to reconcile the PLO chief
with Syrian President Hafez Assad.
   Assad and Arafat met in Damascus in April and again in Algiers
in June. But they have failed to patch up their bloody five-year
feud over who would control the Palestinian guerrilla movement.
   The inter-Palestinian war has capped six years of assaults on
the camps. The Israelis devastated the shantytowns during the 1982
invasion. In September 1982, Israeli-backed Christian militiamen
massacred hundreds of refugees in Chatilla and Sabra, the smallest
of the three Beirut camps.
   Sabra then was demolished in a crackdown by Syrian-backed Shiite
Moslems.
   Thousands more were killed in three years of fighting between
the guerrillas in the camps and Syrian-backed Shiite Moslem
militias that ended earlier this year.

   Five Palestinians were convicted and
sentenced to death Wednesday in the 1986 hijacking of a Pan Am
jetliner that left 21 people dead, including an Indian-American, a
local government official said.
   Judge Mohammad Zafar Barbar sentenced the defendants in a
makeshift courtroom in a prison in this town 30 miles west of
Islamabad. He blamed lax airport security in part for the
hijacking, in which four of the Palestinians entered the plane
dressed as security guards.
   The Boeing 747 on a stopover between Bombay, India, and New
York, was seized on the ground Sept. 5, 1986, in Pakistan's
southern port of Karachi with 400 people aboard, including 44
Americans.
   It sat on the tarmac for 17 hours before the Palestinians,
fearing an attack when an onboard generator ran out, sprayed the
cabin with bullets and Pakistani troops stormed the plane.
   The defendants contended they were innocent in the murders and
blamed Pakistani commandos for the killings. Two hundred others
were injured.
   ``We don't care about the sentence,'' said Mohammad Hafiz Turk,
32, the only one of the five who was not on the hijacked plane. He
was sentenced to hang for his part in planning the hijacking. ``We
care only about the millions of Arabs and Islamic countries.''
   The other four _ Mohammad Ahmed Munawar, Khalil Hussain Rahayyal
and Saeed Abdul Rahim of Lebanon, and Abdul Latif Sairfani of Syria
_ were sentenced to hang for their role in the hijacking. They also
were sentenced to 10 consecutive life sentences or 250 years in
prison for the deaths of 10 of the 21 passengers. Three of the four
men received an additional life sentence in an 11th death, that of
the Indian-American.
   The four men, ranging in age from 18-24, also were fined nearly
$2,800 in each murder conviction. Half the money will be given to
relatives of the hijack victims.
   In Washington, the State Department welcomed the convictions.
   ``The Pakistan court decision is an important action in bringing
the rule of law to bear against terrorists,'' said a statement read
by spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley.
   The five said they will appeal their convictions and sentences
within the 30-day deadline.
   Libya and the Palestine Liberation Organization both denied any
involvement in the hijacking.
   In an interview following the sentencing, Turk, ringleader of
the group, said if free ``we would hijack another plane.''
   Pan Am was targeted because it is a U.S. carrier, he said.
   ``By using Pan American it was a strike against America,'' Turk
said.
   But he explained ``we are friends to American people. We are
against the administration and the crazy man in New York or
Washington, wherever he is.'' He was referring to President Reagan.
   During sentencing, Barbar said ``security (at the airport)
seemed to be extremely lax.'' The judge questioned how the four men
dressed as security guards could board the Pan Am flight weighed
down with weapons and ammunition.
   The hijackers, he said, ``were able to collect huge caches of
ammunition unnoticed and unhindered.''
   As a result of the sentencings authorities tightened security in
Karachi.
   ``The Karachi administration along with the airport authorities
have increased the security staff at the Karachi airport, Pan Am
office and the United States Consulate,'' said Commissioner Shahid
Aziz Siddiqui.
   ``More armed police (are) posted around the American cultural
center and (we are) more vigilant of Arab students living in
Karachi,'' he said.

possible arrest on airplanes, and proposed federal rules may fail
to protect them against discrimination, the executive director of
the National Federation of the Blind said Wednesday.
   Kenneth Jernigan told more than 2,500 people attending the
annual meeting of the federation that proposed U.S. Department of
Transportation regulations would allow the Federal Aviation
Administration to treat blind people differently from other
passengers.
   Each airline has its own rules about where blind and other
disabled passengers should sit, how they should board and whether
they can keep their guide dogs and canes with them.
   ``Today, the situation is such that no blind person anywhere in
the country can board a plane without fear of harassment, public
humiliation and possibly arrest and bodily injury,'' Jernigan said.
   The Transportation Department last week published nine proposed
rules to govern all airlines' policies, said Matthew Scocozza,
assistant transportation secretary for policy.
   The federation has long argued that a policy held by many
airlines that restricts blind passengers from sitting in emergency
exit rows is discriminatory.
   Scocozza said in a speech to the convention that he agreed with
the federation's position that many blind people are capable of
sitting in an exit row and handling an emergency situation.
   Under one of the proposed rules, no passenger could be required
to sit in a certain area of the plane, ``except where required by
an FAA safety rule,'' Scocozza told a predominantly blind audience
of more than a thousand.
   Jernigan suggested the proposed rule may fail to stop the
humiliations some members of his federation have experienced on
airlines.
   But Scocozza said, ``If nothing else, it's (the rule) a start
that's 30 years too late.''
   In April, James Gashel, an officer of the federation, was taken
into custody on a charge of criminal trespass after he refused to
leave his seat in an emergency exit row of a United Airlines flight.
   United spokesman Joe Hopkins said Wednesday that the airline has
a policy against seating blind passengers in an exit row because in
an emergency, a blind person could not assess the situation on the
other side of the door as well as a sighted person could.
   ``Let's say there's a fire on the other side, a blind person
wouldn't be able to see that,'' Hopkins said.
   Scocozza said the proposed regulations also would:
   _Allow airlines to refuse service only upon a showing that a
patron couldn't be carried safely.
   _Bar single-flight limits on the number of disabled passengers.
   _Bar requirements for disabled people to travel with an
attendant.
   _Bar requirements of advance notice for flights by the
handicapped unless special equipment is needed.
   _Allow guide dogs to travel with their masters, instead of in
baggage holds.
   _Allow the disabled to reject services they don't want, such as
preboarding and safety explanations in Braille.
   Scocozza estimated the overall cost to the airlines of
implementing the rules at $750 million.
   He said the rules were open for comment and could be implemented
by the end of the year.

   American investigators began their
inquiry Wednesday into the shooting down of an Iranian airliner by
questioning senior officers of the cruiser that fired the fatal
missiles, U.S. sources said.
   The six-member military team of experts arrived from the United
States late Tuesday and began their confidential task under a
15-day deadline, which U.S. officers said could be extended.
   Leading the group is Rear Adm. William M. Fogarty, a senior
staff officer at U.S. Central Command headquarters in Tampa, Fla.
It includes a lawyer and technical experts who will analyze
computer tapes, communications records and other data that could
explain the tragedy.
   Iran says the USS Vincennes, a billion-dollar Aegis cruiser with
computerized radar and weapons systems, intentionally shot down the
Iran Air Airbus A300 over the Strait of Hormuz on Sunday. All 290
people aboard were killed.
   It has accused the United States of premeditated mass murder and
pledged revenge in ``the same blood-spattered skies'' over the
Persian Gulf, where Iran and Iraq have been at war since September
1980.
   The United States says the Vincennes fired because signals sent
by one of two airliner's transponders were were analyzed in its
combat information center as being from an F-14 fighter on an
attack bearing.
   Iranians shouting ``Death to America!'' and waving banners
vowing revenge held funerals Wednesday for 24 of the victims at
Bandar Abbas, where the flight originated, and in Zahedan.
   Javier Perez de Cuellar, U.N. secretary-general, spent an hour
in Geneva with Mohammed Javad Larijani, deputy foreign minister of
Iran. Neither side would comment about the meeting.
   In New York, the United Nations announced Wednesday that the
Security Council will convene on the issue July 12, at Iran's
request. It said the Montreal-based International Civil Aviation
Organization will meet the following day on Iran's demand for an
inquiry. American officials said the United States would cooperate
with an investigation by the U.N. agency.
   U.S. military sources said the team's first order of business
was to interview Capt. Will C. Rogers III, skipper of the
Vincennes, and other officers who were present as he watched the
crisis develop on a huge blue video screen and gave the order to
shoot.
   American officials said earlier the officers would be under
oath. They said the investigators' mandate does not exclude
recommending disciplinary action if there appears to be grounds for
it.
   Navy officials would not divulge the whereabouts of the
9,600-ton cruiser, but one said privately it was ``a reasonable
assumption'' the Vincennes had anchored off Bahrain overnight. If
so, it was far enough out to be invisible from shore through the
haze.
   All aspects of the investigation will remain secret while it is
in progress, U.S. officials said.
   Fogarty, who once commanded the battleship New Jersey, is
director of plans and policy for the Central Command,
administrative headquarters for U.S. military affairs in 19
countries of the Middle East and North Africa.
   His team was met in Bahrain by Rear Adm. Anthony A. Less,
commander of the U.S. Joint Task Force Middle East, which includes
the approximately 29 U.S. warships opeating in the gulf and Arabian
Sea.
   A senior U.S. officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
it was ``highly doubtful'' investigators would be able to talk to
Iranian officials.
   An unanswered question is why the Airbus was not diverted from
the area of a skirmish involving the Vincennes, the frigate Elmer
Montgomery and several armed Iranian speedboats.
   Initially, the U.S. Navy report said two speedboats were sunk, a
third was damaged and The Vincennes shot down an Iranian F-14
fighter. The plane later proved to be the Iran Air jet, which was
on a scheduled flight to Dubai from a combined military-civilian
airport at Bandar Abbas.
   The battle was the first direct encounter between U.S. warships
and Iranian armed craft since April 18, when U.S. attacks on two
Iranian oil platforms in reprisal for the mining of a Navy frigate
started a day of combat in which six Iranian craft were sunk or
disabled.
   One theory in gulf diplomatic and aviation circles is that an
Iranian F-14 was using the Airbus as radar ``cover'' to approach
the American ships.
   A U.S. official, also speaking privately, said he had no
evidence for the speculation, which is expected to be among
questions the U.S. investigators will try to resolve.
   In Washington, Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., said Pentagon officials
were examining ``the possibility'' of a second plane, but a Navy
spokesman, Lt. Brian Cullin, said: ``We do not believe there was
another aircraft in the area.''
   Aspin, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said
Defense Department officials told a closed briefing a ``wide range
of possibilities'' was under study, including the possibility of
``a military plane that was somehow masked'' by the airliner.

<HEAD>Caribbean Leaders Draft Letter To Protest U.S. Interference</HEAD>

   Caribbean leaders were preparing a
letter to President Reagan on Wednesday accusing his administration
of impinging on the sovereignty of other nations in anti-drug
campaign in order to attract votes in an election year.
   A draft letter protesting U.S. drug policy in the Caribbean was
circulated among leaders of 13 member nations of the Carribean
Common Market and Commmunity, or Caricom, holding a five-day annual
summit meeting in St. John's.
   Lester Bird, deputy prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda,
acting as spokesman for the group, said a second draft of the
letter accused the United States of ``derogation'' of the Caribbean
nations' laws.
   ``They feel that the domestic imperatives of an election year in
America have forced certain people in certain parts of the American
process to step beyond what is acceptable in terms of ... the
sovereignty of a country,'' Bird said after the closed-door morning
session. He gave no specific examples.
   The U.S. attempt to stop the flow of drugs into the United
States through the Caribbean has become a key issue at the summit.
   At opening ceremonies Monday, Prime Minister Lynden Pindling of
the Bahamas denounced the United States for what he called
politically motivated intervention in certain countries. He
suggested he was made a ``scapegoat'' for failing to stop drugs
from reaching the United States through his archipelago of more
than 700 islands.
   For years, Pindling has been the target of allegations that he
personally benefited from the drug trade.
   On Tuesday, the leaders unanimously agreed to condemn the United
States for what they considered interference in their countries and
in Panama. The Reagan administration sought the ouster of Panama's
de facto ruler, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, after his indictment
in Florida on federal drug charges.
   Bird said Wednesday the prime ministers' stance was not meant to
protect any one government, although it might have the ``spinoff''
effect of doing so.
   He said Caribbean leaders condemn the drug trade and in many
cases are working directly with U.S. drug enforcement authorities,
but cooperation should not be abused by interfering with their
rights to run their own affairs.
   ``There are agreements which lay out the procedure in which
working closely can be achieved without affecting the integrity of
your own institutions,'' he said. ``That's the issue that's at
point here _ the whole question of extraterritorial jurisdiction.''
   It remained unclear whether the Caricom leaders would take a
position on the Haitian government of Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, who
seized power in a military coup June 19. Haiti has observer status
in Caricom.
   The 13 Caricom nations are Antigua-Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados,
Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Montserrat, St.
Kitts-Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and Trinidad-Tobago.

   An air force Mirage jet fighter jet
crashed into a two-story food processing plant Wednesday, killing
both crewmen and 13 plant workers, authorities reported.
   The crash injured 32 workers and started a fire that severely
damaged the factory, according to company officials, rescue workers
and witnesses.
   A witness, Bashir Baloch, said the fighter was burning when it
hit the building. The plant processes cooking oil and other foods,
employing about 200 people.

   Talks between Japan and the United States have
focused on balancing trade between the countries, but haven't
ignored the fact that Japan has built its technological edge on the
foundations of Western science.
   Under a pact signed last month by President Reagan and Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita, Japan will donate $4 million to invite
U.S. scientists and engineers to the country, open research
laboratories to Americans and boost the number of foreign
researchers invited on scholarships from 28 to 200.
   Washington long has demanded more funding and a commitment to
balance the flow of researchers and information, getting tough as
critics, especially U.S. industry, call for an end to what they say
has been Japan's free ride.
   The Japan Center at the University of North Carolina estimates
that 15,000 Japanese students and researchers enter U.S.
institutions a year, five times the number of Americans coming to
Japan.
   Japan earned $2.2 billion from foreigners in fiscal 1986 on its
patent licenses and other technology information, while it paid
$2.4 billion, over 80 percent of that to the United States.
   Hiroshi Inose, head of the National Center for Science
Information System, discounts Tokyo's latest moves.
   ``It's a big step but it's still symbolic,'' said Inose,
developer of the government's fifth-generation computer research
project and one expert consulted by the government over the
bilateral science pact.
   ``We should establish a sort of system of substantial scale in
terms of money, or university chairs and positions, and let this be
understood by the Americans and the Europeans,'' Inose said. ``They
will decide whether they want to come over.''
   Leading Japanese scientists, many of whom have studied or worked
in America, agree that the time has arrived for Japan to repay its
debt.
   ``My generation has all gone to the United States to study.
Japan just preaches about international cooperation, but it really
has to start putting out more funds ... like the U.S. government
which has spent so much over the years,'' Tokyo University
Professor Shoji Tanaka, one of the world's leading
superconductivity researchers, said in an interview.
   Inose, who invented the digital telephone switch as a researcher
at the University of Pennsylvania and Bell Telephone in the late
1950s, agrees.
   ``I have repeatedly told the government that the United States
has spent a great deal to invite Japanese scientists and engineers
on Fulbright scholarships... I don't think we ever reciprocated for
that.''
   The U.S.-Japan Agreement on Cooperation in Science and
Technology was first signed in 1980 to promote basic research in
non-energy areas. It was renewed five times since 1985 and, after
10 months of negotiations ending in June, officials agreed to a new
pact effective from 1988 to 1993.
   The largely symbolic agreement was not controversial until
tensions mounted over Japan's trade surplus. When full-scale talks
to renew the pact began last year, the United States surprised
Japan by laying down a list of stringent rules to balance bilateral
cooperation.
   In 11th-hour talks in June, U.S. negotiators won a major
concession when Japan agreed to restrict the publication of joint
technology with possible military application and to restrict the
transfer of such information.
   Technological exports include information and licenses on old
and new technology, such as submarine-silencing equipment Toshiba
Machine Co. sold to the Soviet Union in violation of a Western
block trade agreement.
   No provisions exist under Japanese law to prevent the
dissemination of scientific and technological information developed
for peaceful purposes. But officials say they can adhere to the
pact because both sides have agreed to distribute the results of
their joint research as widely as possible.
   In Tokyo, however, the feeling pervades that Japan is being
forced to comply with a pact of benefit only to Washington. ``To us
in Japan it appears we are under the pressure of the U.S.
government,'' Inose said.
   Japanese officials point to a number of problems overlooked by
Washington.
   Nagahide Onozawa will oversee 100 of the foreign researchers
under the jurisdiction of the governmental Japan Society for the
Promotion of Science. He says promising American scientists,
eligible for 30 to 40 of the endowments, are not the most likely
candidates to respond to the new program.
   ``Apart from the problems of language and style of living, many
researchers at the start or the peak of their careers are not that
interested in coming to Japan ... they're afraid of being left
behind by their colleagues back home.''
   Tanaka, head of the government's International Superconductivity
Technology Center, questions the intentions of the U.S. government
and industry.
   Tanaka found no takers when he recently visited the United
States in an attempt to woo American corporate participation in the
new superconductivity project despite paranoia that Japan was
taking the lead in the field, which promises a bounty in terms of
application patents.
   Tanaka said nationalism is driving the U.S. government as it
closes off symposiums on superconductivity to foreign participation
in a bid to take first place in the field. Yet superconductivity is
one area U.S. officials selected for joint research in drawing up
the new bilateral agreement.
   Tanaka and other scientists say U.S. industry is not interested
in joining costly programs like the one he heads.
   William Norris, chairman emeritus of the Control Data Corp.,
echoed the opinion of U.S. firms when he told a recent U.S. Senate
space subcommittee that Japan should give U.S. firms ``free
access'' in exchange for the technology it has developed from
American research.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Yoshifumi Matsuda said in a briefing,
``The Americans' major interest is in Japanese institutions of
applied science rather than basic science. Most of the applied
science institutions here are private ... and we cannot control the
private sector.''
   Japan's private industry footed 80.3 percent _ compared with the
50 percent U.S. firms put up in America _ of the $68 billion the
nation spent on research and development in 1985.
   Of the research in Japanese industrial laboratories, almost 94
percent of the outlays went into experimental development and
applied research, a fact not overlooked by U.S. industry.
   Japan's technological standing, Inose said, is world-class in
fields like computer memories and biotechnology. ``The United
States cannot excel in every area and they have to think about an
international division of labor.''

   Opposition presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas challenged the government's claim that one of his key
strategists and an aide were killed by the criminal underworld, not
political assassins.
   He said Wednesday he still believes Francisco Ovando Hernandez
and Ovando's aide, Roman Gil Heraldez, were victims of
``reactionary elements'' bent on provoking election violence.
   Cardenas, candidate of the leftist National Democratic Front
coalition, spoke with reporters while waiting to vote in the
national election.
   Hours before the polls opened for the most hotly contested race
in decades, federal district police officials said they had
discarded a political motive for the slayings Saturday night.
   They blamed criminals seeking revenge for Ovando's work as
Michoacan state attorney general when Cardenas, then still a member
of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, was governor of
the state.
   ``I don't consider that to be the truth,'' Cardenas said
Wednesday.
   Opposition parties claim the ruling party, known as the PRI for
its initials in spanish, has used intimidation, voter manipulation
and fraud to stay in power since it was founded in 1929.
   President Miguel de la Madrid promised the nation the murder
case would be solved quickly.
   Jorge Obrador Capellini, director of the Federal District
Judicial Police, went on national television Tuesday night to
announce the results of the 3-day-old investigation.
   He said police had more than a dozen suspects, none of whom had
been arrested. He named three people, two of them prison inmates,
as the masterminds.
   Cardenas said Wednesday there was ``no reason to believe that
these people he is naming could have been the ones'' who ordered
the killings.
   Ovando, 41, and Heraldez, 28, were shot to death while driving
home from a political meeting. Party officials have said
confidential documents outlining the Cardenas coalition's plans to
monitor the voting were missing from their car.
   Obrador Capellini said the murders were timed to make them look
like a political crime.
   He said several Michoacan law enforcement officials had been
murdered by the same criminal gang and outlined criminal
prosecutions in the state that he said provided motives for the
slayings.
   Cardenas rejected this theory. He said Ovando had little to do
with the cases mentioned when he was attorney general from
September 1980 to June 1981.
   The murders showed voters how far ``some of the most reactionary
sectors'' are willing to go to stop the opposition, he said. Most
polls have shown Cardenas running a strong second to the PRI
candidate, Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
   Ovando, a longtime friend and political associate of Cardenas,
was in charge of the coalition plan for monitoring the election for
fraud. He was buried Tuesday in Michoacan state.

   Israeli troops shot and wounded a 9-year-old
Arab boy during clashes in the occupied West Bank Wednesday,
hospital officials said, and assailants hurled two firebombs at a
bus in Jewish west Jerusalem.
   Israel's military government ordered all Palestinian-run
government hospitals in the West Bank to stop treating casualties
of the Arab uprising free of charge, Arab doctors said.
   There were no reports of injuries in the firebomb attack on King
George Street, the center of west Jerusalem's shopping district.
Police rushed to the scene to search for suspects and stopped Arab
passers-by for identity checks.
   Palestinians have stepped up firebombs attacks on Israeli
targets in recent weeks, but rarely have they acted in busy Jewish
population centers such as west Jerusalem.
   In other developmentes Wednesday:
   _Police arrested a dozen Palestinians in Arab east Jerusalem
after youths stoned riot police and buses.
   _The military administration extended for three days a closure
order against all 800 Arab schools in the West Bank, an Israeli
spokesman said. The army says the schools, which are to reopen
Monday, are centers of unrest in the nearly 7-month-old Palestinian
uprising.
   _The government said it would check a complaint of the ABC-TV
network that Israeli secret service agents posed as ABC employees
to deceive a 17-year-old Palestinian, whom they arrested.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, Palestinian youths stoned an
army patrol and troops opened fire, wounding 9-year-old Ahmed
Sarkaji in the left leg, said officials at the city's Al-Ittihad
Hospital.
   An army spokesman said two Nablus residents were hurt, including
one by a rubber bullet. He said he had no further details.
   Police closed two schools in east Jerusalem after Arab students
burned tires and hurled rocks at riot police, said police spokesman
Alex Lapidot. One officer was slightly injured by a stone, and
police detained one youth, Lapidot said.
   Eleven other Arabs were arrested after buses were stoned,
Lapidot said. In one stoning attack, three Arabs fled into east
Jerusalem's central bus station, and police fired tear gas into the
crowded terminal before capturing the suspects.
   Arab hospital officials said the new order regarding patient
payments was given to the directors of government-run West Bank
hospitals at a meeting Tuesday at the military government
headquarters in Bet El.
   A senior military spokesman said the order was not new, but a
restatement of existing policy. It applies to all patients who do
not have health insurance from the military government, not only
those wounded in the uprising, the official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The Israeli daily Al Hamishmar and the Arab daily Ashaab
newspapers said the hospitals were ordered to charge $175 per night
to every patient _ including wounded Palestinians _ and to demand a
three-night advance payment.
   The hospitals are funded by taxes collected from Palestinians in
the West Bank.
   In addition, a Palestinian patient must sign a contract allowing
the hospital to use his property as collateral against the final
payment, the newspapers said.
   The government forbids the hospitals to transfer casualties to
Israeli hospitals, as was done before in emergency cases.
   Thousands of Arabs have been wounded by Israeli gunfire in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza strip since the rebellion began
Dec. 8. Four Israelis and 215 Palestinians have died.
   About 9 percent of the wounded were admitted to West Bank
government hospitals and most of those have been unable to pay
their bills, said Dr. Abdel Rahman Shunar, director of the Rafidiye
hospital in Nablus.
   He said the hospital had 16 wounded Palestinians when they
received the order Tuesday, and four were sent home while 12 were
transferred to private hospitals.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's aide Avi Pazner said the
government would check allegations that two carloads of Israeli
civilians impersonated an ABC News crew June 24 to arrest Nizar
Dakdouk, 17, of the West Bank village of Salfit.
   ABC correspondent Dean Reynolds said the network learned of the
incident and complained to the Israeli police, the army and
Shamir's office before making the complaints public in a broadcast
Tuesday.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz
begins talks Thursday with Southeast Asian leaders on Cambodia's
future, the Vietnamese boat people and U.S.-Asian trade problems.
   Shultz arrived in the Thai capital Wednesday at the start of a
nine-country trip through Asia and the Pacific. He was greeted by
tight security, expected to be a feature of his entire stay.
   Also on Shultz's Asian agenda are the fate of U.S. military
bases in the Philippines, security at the upcoming Olympics in
Seoul and development of democracy in South Korea.
   A senior Thai military officer said special precautions were
being taken because of Sunday's shooting down of an Iranian
airliner by U.S. missiles in the Persian Gulf. Iran has threatened
revenge, and Asian officials and journalists are likely to ask
Shultz for explanations of the incident.
   The Malaysian Foreign Ministry Tuesday said it deplored the
American action, adding it was difficult to believe or accept U.S.
claims that its forces mistook the large civilian aircraft for a
military one.
   The Thai officer, who requested anonymity, said sharpshooters
were included in a security task force which includes police, air
force and army personnel. Reporters were barred from the military
section of Bangkok's international airport where the secretary's
official aircraft landed.
   Shultz's two-week journey will be his last and longest to Asia
as secretary of state. After Thailand, he goes to Malaysia,
Indonesia, the Philippines, Hong Kong, China, South Korea, Japan
and the new Marshall Islands Republic in the Pacific.
   On Thursday, Shultz will take part in a dialogue among the six
members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and
Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Australia and the European
Economic Community.
   He is expected to stress that the United States adamantly
rejects a return to power in Cambodia by the Khmer Rouge, a message
that will be repeated in Beijing, which supplies the guerrillas
with weapons.
   Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno of Japan also arrived in Bangkok on
Wednesday.
   Japanese Foreign Ministry officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, say Uno will tell the SEATO foreign ministers Japan will
do more to expand trade and investment in the region. He also is
expected to express support for peace efforts in Cambodia by ASEAN.
   At their annual conference here earlier this week, the ASEAN
ministers sidestepped the Khmer Rouge problem, focusing instead on
a total withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia and plans for
a politial settlement of the war.
   Fear of a return by the Khmer Rouge, who turned Cambodia into a
killing field during their 1975-78 rule, has been sparked by an
ongoing partial Vietnamese troop withdrawal and Hanoi's pledge to
end its military presence in Cambodia by 1990.
   Vietnam drove the Khmer Rouge from power in 1979.
   Shultz will be meeting here with Prince Norodom Sihanouk, whom
the United States supports but who leads a three-party
anti-Vietnamese resistance which also includes the Khmer Rouge.
   The ASEAN ministers have said they would ask the United States
and other countries to accept more Indochinese refugees who
continue to flee to Southeast Asia from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.
   Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Hong Kong have recently
toughened their policies on providing Vietnamese ``boat people''
with temporary asylum. Washington has criticized the moves.
   The U.S. government says it is committed to accepting 29,500
Indochinese refugees from first asylum countries for resettlement
this fiscal year. It has accepted more than 900,000 since 1975,
including 32,000 last year.
   In China, Shultz will express American concern about a reported
flow of Chinese missiles to ``hot spots'' in the Middle East,
sources in Washington said.
   Shultz expects to deliver a major speech in Seoul July 18 on
expanding democracy and human rights in South Korea. There also
will be discussions on the running of a trouble-free Olympics,
which begin in the South Korean capital Sept. 17.
   American use of Philippine military bases will probably be aired
in Bangkok as well as Manila, where negotiations over their future
is continuing. As a bloc, ASEAN has refused to take a stand on the
issue but most individual members want a solid U.S. military
presence in the region to offset Soviet power.
   Trade issues and Japan's emerging role as both a political and
economic force in Asia are likely to feature in discussions in
Tokyo, Shultz's last stop on the Asian continent.

   The government said Wednesday that
OPEC and non-member oil producers are discussing ways to reduce
world output in an effort to boost depressed prices.
   Venezuela's delegate to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, Felix Rossi Guerrero, said the possibility of a special
OPEC meeting ``cannot be discounted.''
   ``We are worried by the situation and we are sure the other OPEC
members are too, so consultations and the exchange of opinions
between OPEC and non-OPEC members to find a solution should not
seem surprising,'' he said. ``If this situation is not modified the
outlook will be very negative.''
   A regular OPEC ministerial meeting is scheduled for November.
The last regular conference was held last month in Vienna.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two strong undersea earthquakes rocked the northern
Japanese island of Hokkaido early Thursday, but officials reported
no damage or casualties.
   The Central Meteorological Agency said the first tremor struck
at 12:54 a.m. (11:54 a.m. EDT Wednesday) with a preliminary reading
of 6.4 on the Richter scale.
   The quake's epicenter was 36 miles under the seabed off the
coast of Kushiro, 556 miles northwest of Tokyo, the agency said.
   A tsunami, or seismic wave, warning was issued along Hokkaido's
Pacific coast, but was lifted about 30 minutes later, said an
official of the Hokkaido Prefectural Police.
   The second quake jolted the same region an hour later with a
reading of 5.7 on the Richter scale, the agency said.
   There were no reports of damage or casualties from either quake,
said the police officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Richter scale measures the magnitude of a quake at its
epicenter, according to ground motion as recorded on seismographs.
An earthquake of 5 on the Richter scale is considered very strong,
and a 6 severe, capable of widespread damage near the epicenter.
   Every increase of one digit represents a tenfold increase in
magnitude; thus a reading of 7.5 would be 10 times stronger than
one of 6.5.

   The Senate voted Wednesday by a veto-proof
72-23 margin to make companies provide workers and local officials
60 days advance notice of plant closings and large layoffs.
   Nineteen Republicans, many of them up for re-election this year,
joined Democrats in support of the mandatory notices, which
President Reagan cited as his primary reason for vetoing in May a
massive overhaul of the nation's trade laws.
   The bill requires any company or plant employing more than 100
people to give advance written notices to affected workers and
local officials of any layoff or closing of a facility involving 50
or more full-time employees.
   Exempted from the requirement are layoffs caused by
unforeseeable circumstances at the time the notices should have
been provided, and businesses that might be hurt by the notices in
trying to raise capital in order to keep a plant open.
   The vote occurred after Democrats rejected a last-ditch
amendment by Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind., a leader of the opposition to
the measure, to raise the thresholds to half a plant's workforce
and 75 or more workers.
   With the higher thresholds, Quayle said he and other Republicans
would try to persuade Reagan not to veto the bill.
   `We've compromised far enough,'' said Sen. Howard Metzenbaum,
D-Ohio. ``This is a matter of simple human decency: American
workers are entitled to 60 days advance notice before losing their
jobs.''
   House Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., said the House
likely will take up the measure early next week.
   After delaying the vote for two weeks, Republicans agreed
earlier Wednesday to end what critics had claimed was a filibuster
aimed at denying Democrats a chance to override Reagan's expected
veto before the Democratic National Convention begins July 18.
   Only five Senate Republicans _ Warren Rudman and Gordon Humphrey
of Hew Hampshire, James McClure and Steve Symms of Idaho and
Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming _ voted to continue the stalling tactics.
   ``I would hope that the president would see there are sufficient
votes to override a veto and that will mean that he won't veto
it,'' Metzenbaum said.
   Had the measure been law the past two years, more than 800,000
workers who were laid off annually in 1986 and 1987 would have
received the advance notices, he said.
   Democrats voted unanimously for the measure while picking up the
support of nine more Republicans than they had when they failed to
override Reagan's veto of the trade bill last month.
   ``I don't know what the president's going to do when he gets
this bill,'' said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, who
called the vote a ``big victory for the labor leaders in America.''
   Reagan had indicated he would sign a trade bill that did not
include the plant closing measure. But the AFL-CIO said it would
withdraw its pivotal support for the trade legislation without
enactment of a separate plant closing law.
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland called Wednesday's vote margin
overwhelming and said it ``is a welcome message for American
workers.''
   Republicans last week succeeded in stalling the vote until after
the July 4th holiday. Only five of them voted with Democrats to
break the filibuster then.
   ``I'm certain that it's going to pass and become law,'' Sen.
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said just before Wednesday's vote. ``The
tragedy is that we're doing this all because of politics.''
   With polls showing that 80 percent of Americans favor making
companies provide their employees advance notice of layoffs, the
issue has given Democrats a major opening to attack Reagan
administration economic policies.
   Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis has endorsed
the idea of federally mandated advance notices nationwide, even
though he opposed them on other than a voluntary basis in
Massachusetts. As governor, he feared that businesses would
relocate in other states.
   Republicans stalled action on the bill last week by trying to
make Democrats vote first on the Massachusetts voluntary notice law
that Dukakis has touted as an example of his concern for workers.
   Democrats balked at allowing a vote then _ on a day that Dukakis
was making a series of courtesy calls in the Capitol _ that would
have enabled Republicans to claim as a rejection of the
Massachusetts governor.
   Vice President George Bush has endorsed voluntary notices _ the
same position taken by the Reagan administration the last four
years _ and conditioning federal contracts and tax incentives to
pledges by companies to provide advance notices as part of their
affirmative action plans.
   A Bureau of Labor Statistics study in May showed that more than
400,000 workers in just 49 states lost their jobs last year to mass
layoffs and plant closings.
   The bureau concluded in a 1987 study of layoffs in six states
that 64 percent of the workers affected received no advance notice
they would lose their jobs and another 16 percent were told less
than two weeks in advance.

   Delegates to the National Education
Association's annual convention approved a resolution Wednesday
urging all school districts to provide counseling for students
struggling with their sexual identities.
   The resolution was adopted after a stormy debate by a standing
vote of the 8,227 delegates attending the NEA's annual convention
here.
   The two-sentence measure put the 1.9-million member teacher
union on record in favor of all persons, regardless of sexual
orientation, having equal opportunity within the public school
system.
   It added: ``The Association further believes that every school
district should provide counseling for students who are struggling
with their sexual-gender orientation.''
   John Walters, chief of staff to U.S. Education Secretary William
J. Bennett said the resolution neglected the primary role of
parents in guiding children in such sensitive matters.
   ``Schools have a big enough job teaching basics like reading and
math and character,'' he said.
   Speaking in favor of the measure, NEA Secretary-Treasurer
Roxanne Bradshaw said she knew a young girl who attempted suicide
and wound up in a comma because of her distress over her sexual
identity.
   Indiana teacher-delegate Art Daniel said, ``It is not the intent
of this resolution to encourage a gay or lesbian orientation, but
to help children accept and deal with their orientation whatever it
may be.''
   Those who spoke against the measure argued that existing union
positions on civil rights, counseling and other matters adequately
covered the concerns raised in the resolution.

   WINDHOEK, South-West Africa (AP) _ A bomb killed a black man and
wounded 18 people at a butcher shop in an affluent white area
Wednesday and a second bomb wrecked an army truck in a black
township 11 hours later, police reported.
   Police said no one was hurt at Katatura black township, on the
outskirts of Windhoek, when an explosive device was thrown under a
parked army truck at about 10:20 p.m.
   Col. Jumbo Smith, a police spokesman, said the explosion blew
out house windows and shock waves woke people miles away.
   Two victims of the first bomb were in critical condition and
four were hurt badly, including a woman who lost a leg, police
spokesman Kierie du Rand said.
   He said it appeared the bomb was inside a parcel left in the
shop. Du Rand said most of the wounded were black, although the
shop is in a white area.
   Witnesses said an adjoining store was damaged and broken glass
and other debris littered the street.
   No group claimed responsibility for either explosion but police
blamed the South West African People's Organization, a guerrilla
group that began fighting 21 years ago for independence in the
territory, also known as Namibia.
   ``I have no doubt in my mind that SWAPO is responsible,'' du
Rand said.
   South Africa captured the territory from Germany in World War I
and was given a League of Nations mandate over it. The United
Nations abrogated the mandate more than 20 years ago, but the South
Africans have refused to leave.
   The deadliest bombing in the guerrilla war occurred Feb. 19,
when an explosion at a bank in the north-central town of Oshakati
killed 27 people.

   The White House launched the search for
Attorney General Edwin Meese III's replacement Wednesday, saying
President Reagan's aides were collecting names of candidates ``from
various sources.''
   Reagan met privately with Meese, his longtime California friend
and political confidant, and the White House said nothing of what
had transpired. It said the meeting was granted at Meese's request.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater conceded that White House officials
had no contingency plan to find a replacement, even though Meese
indicated some time ago he might leave before the end of the
administration.
   ``We had an attorney general up until (Tuesday) yesterday,''
Fitzwater said. ``We don't compile lists for positions where
they're already filled.''
   Fitzwater had said earlier that Meese told Reagan ``some time
ago that he might want to leave before the end of the
administration. The president left the timing up to him.''
   Reagan, who conceded Tuesday that he had ``nobody in mind'' to
take Meese's place, on Wednesday ``briefly discussed'' a successor
for Meese with White House chief of staff Kenneth Duberstein and
general counsel A.B. Culvahouse, the spokesman said. He did not say
whether Reagan and Meese had talked about whom to select.
   A Justice Department spokesman, Patrick Korten, was asked
whether the attorney general would play an active role in choosing
a successor.
   ``I think he's already weighed in on the subject,'' Korten said
in reference to Meese's meeting with Reagan.
   As he left the White House, Meese was asked what he had told
Reagan. He gestured in the direction of his car and said ``I've got
to go.'' Interviewed later on Cable News Network, Meese was asked
what kind of person he thought should succeed him.
   ``I don't think anybody would be a clone of anybody else,'' he
said. But Meese said he hoped the person selected is ``someone who
subscribes to the principles of Ronald Reagan and his
administration.''
   ``I think a lot depends on the willingness of the Senate to
fulfill its responsibility and confirm someone,'' he said. ``I
would hope that someone would be confirmed and take over the day I
leave office.''
   Meese announced Tuesday that he was resigning, effective in late
July or early August. He said he had been vindicated by the fact
that independent counsel James McKay concluded an exhaustive
investigation without seeking his indictment.
   Korten acknowledged that the Office of Professional
Responsibility, a Justice Department unit, may decide to pursue an
ethics examination of Meese despite the fact that he is resigning.
But he said he saw no purpose in such a probe because ``the main
task of OPR is to ensure the integrity and adherence to laws and
regulations by (current) department officials.''
   Meese, in the CNN interview, said he had ``no concerns on that
score.''
   ``This is something that someone else would have to determine,
whether there is any reason to have such an inquiry. But as I say,
if there is, I'll be glad to answer all the questions,'' Meese said.
   The head of Common Cause, a non-partisan public interest group,
sent letters Wednesday to the Office of Professional Responsibility
and the Office of Government Ethics urging the agencies to review
McKay's report and determine if Meese violated executive branch
ethics requirements.
   Fred Wertheimer, president of the group, told the agencies they
should make public their findings ``to make clear to current and
future public officials and to the nation what is required of a
public official under existing executive branch ethical
requirements.''
   Fitzwater said that Culvahouse ``will be considering processes
and procedures and so forth over the next few days _ and criteria,
also collecting the names of candidates from various sources.''
   ``So we are beginning the search immediately,'' he said. ``We'd
like to have a candidate to replace the attorney general before he
leaves, but you just can't predict what the timetable will be.''
   If a new attorney general has not been confirmed by the time
Meese leaves, Fitzwater said, the administration probably would
install Solicitor General Charles Fried in the job on an acting
basis. Fried is outranked by two Justice Department newcomers,
Deputy Attorney General Harold Christensen and Associate Attorney
General Francis Keating, but neither has been confirmed by the
Senate.
   Christensen's name was making the rounds Wednesday on Capitol
Hill, as were a number of others being circulated by various
senators.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., told reporters on
Capitol Hill that the names of former White House chief of staff
Howard H. Baker Jr. and Judith Richards Hope, daughter-in-law of
comedian Bob Hope, sprang immediately into mind.
   Baker resigned as chief of staff, effective June 30, to return
to private law practice in Tennessee. Mrs. Hope's nomination to
succeed Robert H. Bork on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia, has not yet been acted upon by the Senate.
   Others suggested on Capitol Hill were former Nevada Sen. Paul
Laxalt; former House Republican leader John Rhodes, of Arizona,
former Democratic Attorney General Griffin B. Bell, who served
under Jimmy Carter; Reagan's first attorney general, William French
Smith; and Eugene Thomas of Boise, Idaho, former president of the
American Bar Association.
   Tom Loranger, a Laxalt spokesman, said he asked Laxalt about the
speculation and the former senator said, ``there is absolutely no
truth to the rumors about my going to the Justice Department.''
   Fitzwater was asked whether Meese could have remained if he
wished. ``Absolutely,'' he replied. ``Absolutely. The president has
expressed full confidence in Ed Meese at all times.''
   Describing the attorney general's call to Reagan notifying the
president that he was stepping down, the spokesman said, ``The
president said, `OK, if that's your determination'.''
   Fitzwater said Reagan did not try to dissuade his friend,
respecting Meese's wish to step aside.

   An Indiana company is making a new type of
trash bag that won't last long _ and that should be good news for
the environment.
   Gary Weaver, vice president of Rollpak Corp., said his company
makes plastic trash bags made of 7 percent corn starch. The corn
starch is bonded with the complex plastic compound polyethylene.
When soil bacteria and fungi consume the starlene
crumbles into dust that the organisms can break down readily.
   The new bags degrade in two to three years, Weaver said.
Conventional plastic bags may last 100 years or more, and somch, the polyethye
plastics take 300 to 400 years to degrade, he said.
   Several communities nationwide have passed ordinances forbidding
the use of plastic trash bags that are not biodegradable, Weaver
said. Nevertheless, Rollpak, a subsidiary of a Swedish company,
doesn't expect big orders soon because the new bags cost 10 percent
to 20 percent more than other bags, he said.
   Ramani Narayan, a chemical engineer at Purdue University, says
research there may produce plastics containing 30 percent corn
starch that break down in 15 months.
   The technology can be applied to a broad range of plastics and
conserve municipal landfill space, he said. Conventional plastics
accounts for about 30 percent of landfill volume and could rer
father, Army Maj. Rick Hudgens.
   Hudgens said he took control of the plane over Florida when an
aircraft performing acrobatic maneuvers flew nearby, and over
Alberta, when heavy rain reduced visibility.
   Jennifer said bad weather over Canada was the most exciting part
of the 50 to 60 hours of flying it took to reach Nome.
   The plane landed in this old gold mining community at 1:06 p.m.,
ending a 4,500-mile odyssey. Jennifer, from Huntsville, Ala.,
started the trip at Homestead, Fla., with her father on June 16.
   She and her father said they decided to attempt the flight to
Alaska after hearing about a 9-year-old boy who flew from
California to Massuchusetts. Hudgens said the trip cost about
$7,000.
   The two said they planned to return to Fairbanks late Wednesday,
and then begin the long flight home, splitting the flying time.
   Under federal rules, Jennifer cannot fly solo until she is 16
and cannot receive a pilot's license until age 17, her father said.

   Oat bran can't boast the glamour of sushi, the
glitz of kiwi fruit or the rich taste of gelato. But oat bran does
reduce blood cholesterol, a fact that has produced a sevenfold boom
in sales.
   The Home Economist, a bulk food store in suburban Arlington
Heights, has been out of oat bran for a month and manager Karen
Shinville doesn't know when she will get more.
   ``We'd sell 50 to 75 pounds a day. People would buy huge bags of
it,'' said Shinville. ``It's phenomenal.''
   That comes as little surprise to Quaker Oats Co., the
Chicago-based food conglomerate that is the world's biggest
commercial oat bran producer.
   ``Between March 1987 and March 1988, sales shot up 784
percent,'' said company spokeswoman Cheryl Halloran. Oat bran can
be used as a cereal or as an ingredient in muffins, cakes, breads
or other foods, she said.
   Studies show that a daily bowl of bran cereal or a bran muffin
can reduce the risk of heart attack by nearly 40 percent in people
with high blood cholesterol levels. And oat bran, made from the
outer covering of oats, is one of the most efficient of the
water-soluble fibers.
   ``The last two or three weeks it's been a particularly strong
seller,'' said David Savage, manager of the Bread Shop in Chicago.
   ``I think the cholesterol thing was the topic on the `Oprah
Winfrey' (television) show recently,'' he added. ``And then, people
figure the drought might drive prices way up.''
   Despite its health aspect, Shinville says she's not likely to
join the fad.
   ``I've tasted it,'' she said. ``It tastes like real bland
cereal.''

   A Soviet research balloon exploded
off Jutland's east coast Wednesday, dropping a parachute with
unknown equipment into the sea, the defense command said.
   The equipment hit the sea about 8.30 p.m., more than an hour
after it was dropped from the balloon, Maj. Mogens Meyer-Pedersen
told The Associated Press. He said the balloon exploded by a
self-destructive device.
   The balloon, at a height of 112,000 feet, was programmed to drop
its equipment northeast of Moscow but a faulty rudder moved it off
course to the west. It drifted over southern Sweden before
exploding over Djursland in northeast Jutland.
   A crew from the defense command headed for the scene by boat to
retrieve the container with the parachuted equipment.
   Soviet authorities told the Foreign Ministry about the errant
balloon Wednesday morning. They would not say what kind of
equipment it carried.
   The balloon, 198 feet in diameter, had a volume of 6,300,000
cubic feet. It weighed 1,584 pounds and carried 264 pounds of
equipment, the Soviets said.
   Danish television reported earlier the government had not yet
decided whether the equipment would be returned.
   The Soviet news agency Novosti said the balloon was launched
June 28 ``as part of a series of atmospheric experiments.''

<HEAD>Grosz Calls For Openness In Media; Poverty Statistics Reported</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party chief Karoly Grosz
called for more openness in news media Wednesday as newspapers for
the first time bared statistical data showing more than 2.5 million
Hungarians lived in virtual poverty last year.
   Grosz said in an article Wednesday in the communist daily
Nepszabadsag that he was ``deeply impressed'' while visiting Moscow
with the openness of the Soviet press and said ``the Hungarian
media can report on anything but military secrets.''
   He told the newspaper that a meeting of the party Central
Committee set for July 13 would receive extensive coverage. The
official news agency MTI reported from Moscow on Tuesday that Grosz
announced at a news conference there that the meeting would be
broadcast live on Hungarian television and radio.
   Party proceedings have traditionally been conducted behind
closed doors.
   In other stories, Nepszabadsag and the trade union daily
Nepszava said 18 percent of the population lived below ``the social
minimum income level'' in 1987, and 6 percent below ``the living
minimum level.''
   Nepszava noted that ``for a long time, a certain `official
shyness' prevented even the idea of a `minimum wage' to appear
publicly in the media. Also for a long time, there was no such
thing as `poor people' in this country, while there were many who
knew it from experience.''
   ``Social minimum'' was defined as an income level that, in
addition to the most basic needs, allows very modest spending on
some goods and services that are considered requirements ``of the
masses.'' ``Living standard minimum'' only allows paying for bare
necessities.
   In 1987, 1.9 million Hungarians lived beneath the first and
660,000 below the second minimum living standard.

<HEAD>NATO Chief Says Alliance Should Agree Soon on Negotiating Position</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO's new secretary-general, Manfred
Woerner, said Wednesday he hoped the alliance would soon agree on a
negotiating position for talks on conventional weapons with Warsaw
Pact countries.
   As soon as the 16-member North Atlantic Treaty Organization has
agreed on a position, efforts should begin to get talks started, he
told a news conference.
   The former West German defense minister spoke during a one-day
trip to Norway, his first visit to a NATO country since he took
over the top civilian post in the alliance last Friday.
   He said talks with states of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact should
focus on erasing the weapons imbalance and then seeking cuts. NATO
claims Warsaw Pact countries have an advantage over the alliance in
conventional weapons.
   Woerner said the next step should be for the Soviet Union to
structure its forces so it would be incapable of a surpise attack
or a large-scale offensive against the West.
   Woerner said his most important task as secretary-general would
be to foster coherence, unity and strength in NATO.
   He returned to Brussels later Wednesday.

   Hot weather baked the Midwest and set records from Pennsylvania
to Wisconsin Wednesday while thunderstorms soaked parts of the Gulf
Coast.
   The heaviest storms hit the Texas Gulf Coast and Florida. Storms
dumped more than 2\ inches of rain on Vero Beach, Fla., in the six
hours ended at 2 p.m. EDT, while Galveston, Texas, received over an
inch.
   Rain also was scattered over the Rockies, western Minnesota and
northern New England.
   The rest of the country stayed dry and temperatures soared into
the 90s and low 100s from the upper Mississippi Valley to the upper
Ohio Valley.
   The mercury hit 101 degrees in Flint, Mich., breaking the old
record for the date and equalling the city's all-time high
established on Aug. 24, 1947, and tied recently on June 25.
   Other highs for the date included 101 degrees in Williamsport,
Pa.; 100 in Grand Rapids, Mich. and South Bend, Ind.; 99 in Fort
Wayne, Ind.; and 98 in Milwaukee.
   The desert Southwest also baked with temperatures in the 100s
while the Pacific Northwest stayed cool in the 60s.
   At 3 p.m. EDT, temperatures ranged from 55 degrees at Everett,
Wash., to 102 degrees at Phoenix, Ariz. The nation's low Wednesday
morning was 29 degrees at Truckee, Calif.
   Several overnight lows were set in the Southeast and the
Northwest, including 36 degrees in Yakima, Wash.; 45 in Lewiston,
Idaho, and Pendleton, Ore.; and 52 in Asheville, N.C.
   Thursday's forecast included scattered showers and thunderstorms
over the Great Plains, the southern Rockies, the lower Mississippi
Valley, Florida and the Northern Atlantic Coast states. Rain is
expected to be heaviest in Louisiana and extreme eastern Texas and
across southern Florida. Sunny skies were predicted for the rest of
the nation, with windy conditions in the northern Plains.
   Highs were expected to be in the upper 80s and 90s across much
of the nation, with temperatures reaching 100 degrees in parts of
the middle Mississippi Valley and soaring to as high as 110 in the
desert Southwest. Highs were forecast to be in the 70s from Montana
to Washington and along the Pacific Coast.

   Workers at Lockheed Missiles & Space Co.
used government computers to run a football pool, built a private
airplane at public expense and billed the government for the time
it took to write the entire Bible into a computer, according to a
lawsuit unsealed Wednesday.
   ``I think we're looking at the tip of an iceberg as far as
secret and top-secret programs go,'' said Margaret A. Newsham, 45,
a former employee of Lockheed and one of the plaintiffs. ``As we
delve into this, I believe we'll find a lot more.''
   ``We expect additional people to step forward and disclose
additional examples of waste and fraud,'' said Guy T. Saperstein,
the Oakland-based lawyer for the plaintiffs.
   The violations that the suit says occurred at one California
plant cost the government more than $10 million, Saperstein said.
   If proven, the charges could result in suspension of defense
contracts to Lockheed Missiles & Space, which employs 23,700
workers in Sunnyvale developing spacecraft, satellite systems and
submarine-launched missiles. It is a subsidiary of Lockheed Corp.,
one of the nation's largest defense contractors.
   Newsham, who appeared at a news conference Wednesday to discuss
the suit, was fired as a computer software analyst by Lockheed
Missiles in 1984 for allegedly padding her time card. The dismissal
is the subject of another suit that is expected to come to trial
this year.
   She was joined in the current suit by Martin Overbeek Bloem, 34,
an engineer who still works for the company.
   The suit charged that some employees skipped work, partied and
ran their own businesses at government expense while waiting for
security clearances for top secret contracts.
   Lockheed spokesman George Mulhern said company officials will
comment on the individual allegations when they receive a copy of
the suit.
   ``But we very vigorously deny that false claims have been or are
made or condoned by the company,'' Mulhern said. ``In fact, we've
had a very strong program over the past several years to make sure
all employees know any form of mischarging is wrong and can lead to
disciplinary action, including dismissal, if warranted.
   ``We are also are very confident the suit, if it goes to trial,
will show the company has not engaged in any improper practices,''
he said.
   Saperstein said he would seek an order from federal court so he
could serve Lockheed with a copy of the suit, which was filed in
U.S. District Court in San Jose in January under the False Claims
Act.
   The Civil War-era federal law, which was strengthened with
amendments in 1986, allows whistle-blowers to keep some of the
judgments against companies convicted of cheating the government.
   Saperstein said such suits are kept secret for 60 days to allow
the Justice Department time to consider action. He said he released
the information on Wednesday after granting the Justice Department
two extensions.
   ``They still haven't made up their minds,'' he said.
   The suit said one senior manager at the plant, using government
charge numbers, had Lockheed machinists build him an airplane. He
was allowed to retire when the project was discovered, and he took
the plane with him, the suit alleged.
   ``(And) one Lockheed employee wrote out the entire Bible onto a
Lockheed computer, charging government contracts for his time,''
the suit claims.
   Newsham and Bloem, according to the suit, held special security
clearances from the National Security Agency, the code-breaking and
surveillance branch of the Defense Department.
   They worked at Lockheed on a project identified in the suit only
as P-285, from 1981 to 1984. The suit says the project was part of
the Pentagon's ``black budget,'' which involves projects so secret
that their funding is classified.
   The suit claims that Lockheed workers waiting for security
clearances were sent to the ``ice box,'' an unclassified area where
they had nothing to do.
   But while employees were there, some allegedly used Lockheed
computers and charged time to government contracts to run
businesses that included selling real estate, honey, stocks,
cosmetics, diet food, jewelry, belt buckles and cable television
decoders.
   Mulhern denied the allegation that employees waiting for
security clearances are given little or nothing to do.
   Newsham and Bloem claim employees were told that even if they
worked less than a full week, to bill various government contracts
for 40 hours. They also claim that Lockheed officials told
employees to charge their time to contracts on which they had not
worked.
   Newsham complained about the alleged abuses to a Lockheed
supervisor, who then threatened to fire her, the suit said.
   The Defense Contract Audit Agency, however, investigated the
allegations and substantiated them after Newsham called a Defense
Department hot line in 1984, the suit said. Reports from the agency
were filed with Newsham and Bloem's suit.

<HEAD>Iran and Kuwait in Friendly Messages over Airbus Incident</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Airliner-Gulf, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kuwait and Iran, their relations strained by
Iran's repeated threats to this Persian Gulf Arab nation, were
reported Wednesday to have exchanged friendly notes since the
weekend downing of the Iranian airliner.
   Foreign Minister Sheik Sabah Al-Ahmed received a written message
from Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, thanking him on
behalf of the Tehran government for condolences Kuwait offered
after the U.S. Navy shot down the Iran Air A300 Airbus on Sunday
with 290 people on board.
   An official Kuwaiti statement said Velayati's message also
expressed condolences ``for the loss of a number of ... (Kuwaiti)
nationals in the incident.'' Thirty-eight non-Iranians were among
the passengers.
   The statement said Sabah sent a reply to Velayati thanking Iran
for its condolences.
   ``Sheik Sabah underscored the gravity of such an incident which
necessitates investigation that would determine its causes and its
circumstances, and prevent its repetition,'' the statement said.
   The messages contained no direct reference to nearly 8-year-old
war between Iran and Iraq.
   Iran has often accused Kuwait of actively aiding Iraq in the
war. In the past years it fired missiles into Kuwaiti territory and
menaced this tiny country's oil shipments in the gulf.
   Iran also has been accused of backing Shiite Moslem saboteurs,
blamed for bombings in Kuwait over the past five yeras.
   The radical Al-Rai Al-Aam newspaper meanwhile urged Iran not to
retaliate for the incident.
   It said that ``such an error cannot be ruled out in area whose
land, sea and air are jammed by military equipment, civilian
aircraft and commercial ships. ... The threat of revenge against a
superpower will not serve the cause of peace or end tension but
rather it will lead to another series of violence and
counterviolence.''
   In the United Artab Emirates, the Dubai-based, English-language
newspaper Khaleej Times said: ``Iran appears to be in no need to
undertake any adventurist actions. The moral and propaganda gain
for it has already been enormous. ... Iran can easily sit back and
watch the Americans squirm with embarrassment as they try to
explain how one of their most sophisticated ships failed to
distinguish between an Airbus and an F-14 fighter.''

   Conversations wiretapped as part of the Pentagon
procurement inquiry indicate a defense contractor paid some
expenses incurred by a Florida congressman's campaign and may have
passed the cost on to the government, NBC said Wednesday.
   NBC said that according to the wiretaps, Armtec Inc., a
subcontractor for Unisys Corp., paid for a trip a political
consultant made to Rep. Bill Chappell Jr.'s district earlier this
year to do groundwork for the Chappell campaign.
   Unisys official Charles Gardner was heard on a wiretap telling
the consultant he could get paid for the campaign trip by going to
the top man at Armtec, the network said. The wiretap was placed by
FBI and Navy investigators.
   Investigators believe that Gardner also discussed doing phony
paperwork to bill the costs to the Pentagon, NBC said.
   The wiretap transcript indicates Armtec already had paid part of
the expenses, NBC said.
   NBC did not give the amount allegedly paid. It did not identify
the political consultant.
   Armtec officials refused to comment, the network said.
   NBC said investigators are looking into whether there is a broad
pattern of defense firms paying out cash for political purposes via
smaller contractors, with the costs charged to the Pentagon as part
of work on weapons contracts.
   Gardner is now working for defense contractors as a consultant.
   Armtec Inc., based in Palatka, Fla., manufactures wiring
harnesses and is in Chappell's congressional district. Its offices
were searched as part of the defense inquiry.

   Thousands of workers from
Yugoslavia's largest rubber and shoe plant forced their way into
the Federal Parliament on Wednesday, demanding changes in the
government and protesting low living standards. They later were
evicted.
   In an action unprecedented in Communist Yugoslavia's postwar
history, about 4,000 demonstrators clashed with security police in
front of the Parliament building. Police were unable to keep them
from entering.
   The protesters filled the main lobby of the domed building for
about half an hour before security men forced them to leave.
   There were no injuries reported from the brief scuffle.
Uniformed police used only their hands to keep the demonstrators
away from passers-by.
   About 5,000 demonstrators, representing more than 10,000
strikers of the Borovo plant, traveled from Borovo, about 60 miles
west of Belgrade. They began arriving in the capital overnight.
   They demanded a 100 percent pay increase and changes in the
government's economic austerity program and national leadership.
   The workers said their average monthly wage is about $62.50. The
monthly salary of an average Yugoslav is about $120.
   The demonstrators called for the resignation of Foreign Trade
Minister Nenad Krekic. He was director of the plant two years ago,
and workers blame him for their plight now.
   After being evicted, the protesters waited for more than seven
hours in front to the Parliament in 100-degree heat to hear from
Ivo Latin, a member of the republic of Croatia presidency.
   Latin pleaded with them to return to Borovo, where he said
negotiations to resolve the problems would resume.
   But the workers booed Latin, who could not continue his speech.
They demanded talks with Premier Branko Mikulic.
   The workers left Belgrade for Borovo by buses and trucks shortly
after midnight Wednesday, ending about 24 hours of demonstrating in
the capital.
   The official Tanjug news agency said that Parliament was
consulting high-ranking state and party leaders, including
President Raif Dizdarevic and Communist Party President Stipe
Suvar, to try to find a solution to the workers' problems.
   Mikulic said he would be ready to address the demonstrators ``in
a few days in Borovo,'' Tanjug said.
   More than 10,000 workers at the plant, which employs at least
23,000 people, went on strike Saturday in what is believed to be
one of the largest work stoppages in the country since it became
communist.
   It was the latest in a series of protests by workers voicing
their dissatisfaction with the govermnent's austerity program
allowing substantial price increases and hefty wage cuts.
   The austerity measures, introduced in May, linked wages to
productivity to try to cut inflation, currently hovering at about
175 percent, and to improve overall economic performance.
   Yugoslav officials insist there is no other alternative to the
program, made in conjuction with the International Monetary Fund,
if the country wants to pay off its $21 billion foreign debt.
   The program also lifted price controls for about 60 percent of
goods and services that were under a price freeze since November.
   The action resulted in huge price increases in June when
inflation reached a record 21.1 percent, resulting in a further
drop in living standards that have fallen by at least one-third
since 1980.
   In addition to a 100 percent pay increase, the workers are
demanding a 30 percent reduction of the plant's administration,
better working condition and full payment of their June wages.
   ``They promised us everything except the pay hike which is our
main demand,'' a Borovo worker, Zorica Radic, told The Associated
Press.
   More than 10,000 people demonstrated Tuesday in Vukovar, about
three miles south of Borovo, chanting ``Down with the government!''
and demanidng higher wages, witnesses said.
   Yugoslavia registered a record 1,600 strikes last year,
involving 300,000 workers. Most of the work stoppages were staged
inside factory gates.

   Federal agents who searched the home of an
aerospace lobbyist played tape recorded conversations for him to
induce his cooperation with the government, his attorney said
Wednesday.
   The attorney, William Dougherty, said his client, Fred Lackner,
refused to talk to the agents without consulting his lawyer and has
since turned down a deal offered by federal officials to help build
cases against others.
   Dougherty's comments provided the first indication of government
willingness to bargain with defense industry lobbyists and others
who have figured in the investigation into alleged Pentagon
procurement bribery and fraud.
   The purported deal indicates the government may be willing to
seek the help of lesser known consultants in building cases against
more prominent suspects in the alleged fraud scam.
   Lackner, a former San Fernando Valley aerospace industry
salesman, is one of about 275 people who have been subpoenaed to
appear before a federal grand jury in Alexandria, Va., on July 19.
   Dougherty said Lackner will appear voluntarily.
   The lawyer said agents urged Lackner's cooperation when they
came to his home with a search warrant on June 14.
   ``I wasn't there, but when they served the warrant, they asked
him to cooperate and played some tapes for him and he said, `I want
to see a lawyer,''' Dougherty said.
   The attorney said he isn't sure what tapes were played but
assumes they were of wiretapped conversations similar to those
mentioned in search warrant affidavits unsealed last week in
Dallas. He said he did not know whether Lackner's voice was on the
tapes.
   A federal court in Dallas last week unsealed government
affidavits that included excerpts of wiretapped conversations
between a Navy purchasing official and two consultants.
   Dougherty confirmed that investigators are trying to prove that
Lackner bribed former Pentagon official Stuart E. Berlin, but he
insisted that Lackner gave nothing of value to Berlin.
   Berlin, a friend of Lackner's since the 1970s, was removed as a
contracting official at Naval Air Systems Command last month after
his Pentagon office was searched as part of the defense probe.
   Dougherty said the government deal would have required Lackner
to plead guilty to two counts of bribery and stealing government
property and to cooperate in the investigation. In exchange,
prosecutors would remain silent at Lackner's sentencing, he said.
   The lawyer said he has not been told what charges might be
lodged against Lackner if he fails to cooperate. He added that he
has been unable to gain access to an affidavit filed in support of
the Lackner search warrant that would outline government suspicions.
   Material taken from Lackner's home during the search was not
incriminating, the lawyer said.
   ``He has done nothing illegal,'' said Dougherty. ``They didn't
get a single government document. They got invoices on his
letterhead. ... There were no classifed documents involved with my
client. They didn't seize anything of a proprietary nature.''
   Describing his client's business, he said, ``He's an independent
consultant to consultants. They go around, talk to one another,
pick up information and help people get contracts.''
   He said Lackner continues to work although, ``People do ask
questions I guess.''
   Dougherty said he has advised Lackner not to discuss the case
with reporters.
   Dougherty confirmed that Lackner apparently helped William
Parkin, a consultant for Hazeltine Corp. of Greenlawn, N.Y., obtain
a Navy contract for a device that tests radar-like equipment in
some Air Force and Navy planes.
   Dougherty also did not deny a report in Time Magazine that
Parkin, a former Navy contracting official-turned-lobbyist, paid
Lackner half of his $24,000 annual fee from Hazeltine in exchange
for ``marketing intelligence.'' But he contended there was no
evidence his client paid Berlin for the information later passed on
to Parkin.

<HEAD>Report Says Child Abuse Scandal An Honest Attempt Gone Wrong</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A child sexual abuse scandal which tore apart
scores of families and horrified Britain last year arose from an
honest but misfired attempt to protect children, a judicial inquiry
concluded Wednesday.
   As a result of the 320-page report, the government said it will
spend $12 million to improve training for officials who deal with
abused children and that it was strongly considering setting up a
child protection office.
   In the report, Lord Justice Elizabeth Butler-Sloss blamed two
overconfident doctors, inflexible police and a lack of
communication between officials.
   ``It is unacceptable that the disagreements and failure of
communication of adults should be allowed to obscure the needs of
children ... in so sensitive, difficult and important a field,''
she said.
   During spring and summer 1987, 121 children were diagnosed by
Drs. Marietta Higgs and Geoffrey Wyatt as being sexually abused and
were separated from their parents. Ninety-eight have returned home,
but the report does not rule on whether they were actually abused.
   The spate of alleged cases triggered a national debate on
parents' rights versus child protection.
   Mrs. Butler-Sloss, who took four months to write her report
after her two-month inquiry, told reporters the scandal in the
northeast English county of Cleveland arose partly from the
increased recognition of child abuse and the new problems this
posed.
   ``In Cleveland, an honest attempt was made to address these
problems by the agencies,'' she said. ``In spring 1987, it went
wrong.''
   Mrs. Butler-Sloss said the doctors did not create the crisis but
shared responsibility for it and should be criticized for their
``certainty and overconfidence.''
   The two doctors were also criticized for relying too heavily on
a controversial diagnostic technique called anal dilation.
   The judge said police and the local social services director
failed to resolve differences between agencies involved, and they
and others failed to reappraise their practices although the
numbers of separated families reached dramatic proportions.
   She recommended improving techniques for dealing sensitively
with children and parents in such cases and urged improved
cooperation between doctors, social workers and police.
   An independent children's rights group, the Children's Legal
Center, called the report a ``milestone in the development of
children's rights,'' but some parents who felt wrongly accused
expressed bitterness that the report was not critical enough of
officials involved.
   Some families called for the resignations of local officials and
for Wyatt and Higgs' medical licenses to be taken away.
   ``At the end of the day we are left with the feeling that this
terrible thing happened to us, but nobody says what they're going
to do about it,'' said one parent, who spoke on the condition of
not being identified.

Willington were forced Wednesday to postpone ``walking the line''
to settle a longstanding border dispute when they discovered that
heavy woods made it too difficult to get their bearings.
   Officials of the rural northeastern Connecticut towns decided to
resort to the method used for centuries by New England farmers to
re-establish property lines each spring after being told that an
engineer's survey of the 20 acres of disputed land would cost about
$40,000.
   ``If we're going to actually do any walking, we've decided we
have to do it when there aren't any leaves on the trees, because
it's just too hard to see anything at all,'' said Ashford First
Selectwoman Paula Faulkner.
   Poet Robert Frost immortalized walking the line in his poem
``Mending Wall,'' in which he described to property owners walking
along a stone wall dividing their land that had been partly
demolished by winter weather and hunters.
   Connecticut statute once required that officials from
neighboring towns also walk the line every 10 years to maintain
boundaries, according to Albert Fitzback of Putnam, a surveyor and
member of an arbitration panel appointed by a Superior Court judge
to help settle the border dispute.
   The panel suggested walking the line after Ashford and
Willington officials balked at the cost of a survey.
   At issue is an eight-mile long, mile-wide stip of land that the
General Assembly took from Ashford in 1727 when Willington was
incorporated. Ashford authorities contend the border originally was
drawn as a straight line, but Willington officials have relied on
markers placed in 1916 that create a slight jag in the line.
   The officials did locate one of the key markers during their
abbreviated walk Wednesday night. They expect to continue the
exercise in September or October, once the leaves are off the
trees, said Willington First Selectman Carlton Csiki.
   ``It's a country problem, we're country people and we'll most
likely resolve it in a country fashion,'' he said.

   The legislature on Wednesday named a
government composed of Christian Democrats and Communists, who
together have ruled this tiny republic for two years.
   The new government was formed following May 29 elections for the
legislature, known as the Great and General Council.
   The government is comprised of six Christian Democrats and four
Communists, a gain of one for the Christian Democrats.
   The legislature retained the three top ministers from the
previous government _ Gabriele Gatti, secretary of state for
foreign affairs; Alvaro Selva, secretary of state for internal
affairs and Clara Boscaglia, secretary of state for finance and
budget.
   The Christian Democrats and Communists both posted gains last
month in the elections in this hilltop republic of 23 square miles
surrounded by Italy near the Adriatic coast.
   The smaller Socialist Party lost ground and the Unitary
Socialists stayed steady at 13.6 percent of the vote.
   San Marino, the world's oldest republic and with a population of
22,400, depends on tourism, postage stamps and financial services
as its chief sources of income. It was founded in 301.

   Many defense contractors still aren't serious
about policing themselves, and the Defense Department likely won't
get the money to hire as many fraud investigators as it needs, the
Pentagon's top two inspectors told Congress on Wednesday.
   June Gibbs Brown, the Pentagon's inspector general, said the
number of investigators specifically assigned to track down
contractor fraud has risen from 375 six years ago to more than
1,000 now.
   But at least 450 more are needed, she told the House Armed
Services Committee, and ``Given the department's projected budget
shortfalls for the coming years, I am pessimistic'' they will be
hired.
   Brown and Derek Vander Schaaf, the deputy inspector general, did
not speak specifically about details of the ongoing criminal
investigation into fraud and bribery allegations.
   That probe centers on allegations that defense contractors and
consultants, many of them former defense officials, bribed Pentagon
officials for contracting details that could be vital in winning
contracts worth billions of dollars.
   In other developments:
   _In Southern California, an attorney for aerospace lobbyist Fred
Lackner said federal agents who searched Lackner's home played
tape-recorded conversations to him to induce him to cooperate with
the government. Attorney William Dougherty said Lackner refused to
talk without consulting his lawyer and has turned down an offer of
a deal from federal officials to help build cases against others.
Dougherty confirmed that investigators are trying to prove that
Lackner bribed former Pentagon official Stuart E. Berlin. But he
insisted that Lackner gave nothing of value to Berlin.
   _NBC News reported that conversations wiretapped as part of the
defense probe indicate a defense contractor _ Armtec Inc., a
subcontractor for Unisys Corp. _ paid some expenses incurred by a
congressional campaign consultant and may have passed the cost on
to the government.
   Charles Gardner, then a Unisys official, was heard on a wiretap
telling the consultant he could get paid for the campaign trip for
Rep. Bill Chappell Jr., D-Fla., by going to the top man at Armtec,
the network said. Investigators believe Gardner also discussed
doing phony paperwork to bill the costs to the Pentagon, NBC said.
   The Pentagon recently developed a self-policing code of ethics
that it wants defense contractors to follow, but that hasn't worked
very well, said Vander Schaaf.
   Of the 46 companies who signed the self-policing code, 39 are
under investigation for contract fraud, he told Rep. John Kasich,
R-Ohio.
   Brown said, moreover, ``it is discouraging to me that only 46
defense contractors'' signed the ethics code.
   ``If corporate officials do not recognize this responsibility
and take appropriate actions, no number of auditors, inspectors or
investigators will have a measurable impact upon reducing fraud and
waste in defense programs,'' she said.
   ``Unfortunately, some contractor officials have not taken this
responsibility seriously and have inappropriately blamed their
shortcomings on excessive oversight, regulations and legislation by
the DoD or Congress,'' she said.
   Vander Schaaf agreed. He said ``the contractor situation has
gotten out of hand to a large degree,'' explaining that the
Pentagon doesn't have enough people to effectively oversee
contractor employees.
   While problems with contractors remain, Brown said the Pentagon
itself is doing a better job.
   For example, she said, complaints by contractors about
duplicative audits led to an overhaul of the way the Pentagon
coordinates the numerous agencies it uses to look at contractor
work.
   In the past two years, there have been more than 1,500
convictions in federal courts of contractors or their employees for
a variety of crimes, she said, and $357 million has been returned
to the federal government.
   Also on Wednesday, The Washington Times filed a motion in U.S.
District Court to unseal documents filed in connection with
warrants to search the offices or wiretap the telephones of defense
consultants.
   A number of such warrants were signed by U.S. District Judge
John H. Pratt here. The newspaper sought affidavits filed to obtain
warrants as well as inventories of items seized in searches.
   ``The public's common law and First Amendment fights to access
require the unsealing of these documents,'' the newspaper's lawyers
said in court papers. ``The public has a heightened interest in
obtaining access to the sealed documents at issue since they may
contain sufficient information for the secretary of defense to
suspend payments under contracts obtained with criminal conduct.''

<TEXT>
   Panamanian troops briefly detained
three U.S. soldiers who strayed off base in a military vehicle,
U.S. officials said Wednesday.
   The pro-government newspaper Matutino said Panamanian forces
detained the soldiers Tuesday for unspecified ``suspicious''
activities in Veracruz, a town on the Pacific six miles from the
capital.
   Mercedes Morris, a spokeswoman for U.S. Southern Command
Headquarters in Panama, said the soldiers had simply driven off
Clayton Air Base by accident.
   The soldiers were identified as Lt. Andrew J. Johnson, Sgt. Paul
L. Coach and Sgt. Edward E. Tate. Matutino said they were detained
briefly, then handed over to Southern Command officials.
   Matutino said Panama will formally demand that the United States
end such ``threats of a military invasion'' and breaches of the
1977 Canal Treaties, which forbid U.S. military personnel from
leaving base in uniform.
   The three soldiers were in uniform at the time of the incident.
   Matutino also said their vehicle was equipped for espionage.
Morris denied this, saying the vehicle had nothing but standard
radio-communications gear.
   Tensions are high between the United States and Panama because
of U.S. backing for the ouster of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, head
of the Panamanian Defense Forces and the country's de facto ruler.
Noriega is under indictment in the United States as a drug
trafficker.

   A Panamanian-registered ship seized on the high
seas with more than 72 tons of marijuana was towed into port
Wednesday, and the Coast Guard said its capture was the largest
drug bust ever on the West Coast.
   Officials said the Encounter Bay had endured 60 rounds of
machine-gun fire about 600 miles offshore last Friday, and
surrendered only when threatened with cannon fire.
   The ship was towed into port under tight security by the Coast
Guard cutter Boutwell, which was flying a makeshift ``pot buster''
flag.
   The crew of 18 _ including three Americans, one from England,
one from New Zealand and 13 from Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore
_ were photographed and fingerprinted aboard the Boutwell in
preparation for an appearance before a U.S. magistrate.
   Admiral Robert Kramek, installed last week as regional
commandant, used the occasion to criticize funding cuts in the
Coast Guard's patrol budget. He said the bust was the largest ever
on the West Coast.
   ``This ought to indicate to people ... that it's a flourishing
business, and for the government not to give the Coast Guard proper
funds ... to interdict is foolhardy,'' said Kramek.
   Agents from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration were
waiting on shore for the converted oil-rig supply ship and set up
security for the crew and for the cargo, which will be burned,
officials said.
   If it can be proved they were headed for the United States, they
could face felony charges and prison terms of a few years to life,
said Gary Liming, DEA agent-in-charge.
   Sixteen of the ship's crew members appeared Wednesday afternoon
before U.S. Magistrate John Weinberg and were advised of their
rights, and two others will appear Thursday when a Thai interpreter
is available. All are being held pending a detention hearing Monday
when bail may be set, said deputy clerk Karen Lamborn.
   The Americans were identified as Samuel J. Colflesh, Terrance
Albert Nolan and Gary Robinson, but hometowns were not available,
Ms. Lamborn said.
   The others were Nico Jacob Tuwahatu, Abraham Rumahlaiselan,
Ramil Bin Samaila, Saptu Bin Ismail, Muhid Sus Pingi, Neh Sudariyo
and Bernhard Rumuat, all of Indonesia; Seng Beng Ng, Jupri Beh
Ariffin and Rusfi Beh Ariffin of Singapore; Wuthi Phibulsilpa,
Panya Aranyig and Abdul Syukur, all of Thailand; Jeffrey Bernard
Press of the United Kingdom; and Anthonyo Gilbert Sayers of New
Zealand.
   Cecil Allison, captain of the Boutwell, said the Encounter Bay
appeared headed for the Strait of Juan de Fuca, which separates
Canada's British Columbia and the northeastern corner of the state
of Washington.
   Family and friends of the Boutwell's crew cheered the cutter's
arrival and the makeshift flag of a marijuna leaf marked diagonally
by a red line.
   ``Noriega, put this in your pipe and smoke it,'' said a banner
held aloft by Allison's family. Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriego came under federal indictment in Florida earlier this year
on charges of drug trafficking.
   The 180-foot Encounter Bay was not flying a flag when it was
spotted last Friday by an air patrol 600 miles offshore. It did not
answer when contacted by radio, flag, light, bullhorn and gunfire
signals.
   The Boutwell's crew could read the word Panama in obscured
letters, and a few hours later, the Coast Guard had permission to
board the Encounter Bay from the Panamian Embassy, Allison said.
   Encounter Bay's owner was listed as Countess Shipping Corp. of
Panama.
   The Boutwell fired 60 rounds at the Encounter Bay's rudder and
engine areas. When there still was no response, the Boutwell
threatened cannon fire and the Encounter Bay surrendered.
   ``Our best estimate is there is somewhere in excess of 72 tons''
of marijuana on board, said Allison, who described the drug as
``very high grade with very few stems and very few seeds.''
   Allison speculated that the Encounter Bay stalled to destroy
records.
   ``It was a very organized operation, from the packaging all the
way through to the control of the ship and the cleaning out of the
boat's records.''
   Allison said they found no records that would indicate where the
vessel had come from or was headed to, or who may have been in
charge of the operation.
   He said the marijuana, with a street value estimated at about
$280 million, consisted of about 8,000 ``bales'' packed in four
large shipping containers. Each ``bale,'' in a blue nylon sack,
contained eight packets of marijuana vacuum-sealed in double
plastic wrappings.
   Liming said that much of the marijuana, possibly from Thailand,
probably would have gone to California.

<HEAD>War Camp Survivors Complete Testimony In Nazi Deportation Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDALL HACKLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three survivors of Nazi camps
testified Wednesday in the deportation case of Josef Schwammberger
that the former Nazi SS captain personally shot Jews to death
almost daily, most with a pistol.
   Schwammberger, 76, has been accused of killing at least 5,000
Jews as commandant of the Rozwadow and Przemysl labor camps for
Jews in Nazi-occupied Poland during World War II.
   He escaped Austria with the help of the Nazi Odessa network in
1948, and made his way to Argentina in 1949, where he was arrested
last November.
   The survivors _ Abraham Secemski of Chicago, Edward Blonder of
Miami and Morris Reiter of Toronto _ testified before the
government for two days regarding their experiences in camps
commanded by Schwammberger in 1942-43, said their lawyer, Martin
Mendelsohn.
   They said that besides killing Jews with his own hand,
Schwammberger starved prisoners, killed those who were sick or
became unable to work and, for fun, set an attack dog on Jewish
prisoners.
   ``He was a sadist, an evil person. He played games of life with
humans, with Jews,'' said Blonder, 67, who was in six different war
camps, including Przemysl with Schwammberger. ``He always called us
dogs, schweinhund.''
   ``He was the god, the judge, the jury, the executioner. He was
everything,'' said Secemski, who was in Rozwadow. His uncle was
shot to death by Schwammberger, said Secemski.
   Secemski lost 97 family members during the war. Only he and one
brother survived.
   Reiter, 57, who met Secemski in Przemysl, said he came to
Argentina ``for the humanity of the world, (and to show) that after
40 years people cannot hide from the crimes they've done.''
   Mendelsohn, the Washington-based legal counsel for the Simon
Wiesenthal Center of Los Angeles, said he was optimistic the
Argentine government would strip Schwammberger of his citizenship
and deport him to Stuttgart, West Germany, where he faces war
crimes charges.
   The witnesses and Mendelsohn left Argentina Wednesday night to
return home. None of them saw Schwammberger here.
   ``I would like to face him. It would make me feel better. He's
in jail and now I'm the free man,'' Blonder said.
   Schwammberger is being held in nearby La Plata pending
deportation proceedings. He was arrested Nov. 13 in a
German-Argentine village in the Cordoba provincial hills 500 miles
northwest of Buenos Aires.
   Court records show Schwammberger worked in a petrochemical
company in La Plata for most of his years in Argentina and became a
citizen in 1965. Judicial authorities say he would not have been
granted citizenship had they known of the West German charges
pending against him since 1962.
   Those charges include murder, blackmail and stealing gold
fillings and jewelry from victims.
   Authorities say the French arrested Schwammberger in Innsbruck,
Austria, in July 1945, with eight sacks of plundered jewelry,
watches and gold teeth.
   According to police records in Innsbruck, Schwammberger admitted
possessing the sacks of goods and carrying out ``executions on 35
individuals, shooting them in the back of the neck with a pistol.''

<HEAD>Rhineland Pfalz Votes to Curb Low-level Military Flights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAINZ, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Parliament of Rhineland Pfalz
state on Wednesday unanimously backed a resolution calling for a
ban on military training flights under 1,000 feet, West German
television reported.
   The vote came one day after a West German air force jet fighter
crashed on a training exercise in northern West Germany and after a
series of military-related plane crashes in West Germany in recent
months.
   The resolution, calling on the Bonn government to begin talks
with NATO officials on banning low-level flights, was approved by
all parties representing the state, ZDF television reported.
   The nation's new defense minister, Rupert Scholz, said last week
he would make the problem of low-level flights a top priority.
   On Tuesday a F-4 Phantom crashed into a field and exploded about
25 miles west of Hamburg. Its two pilots ejected safely.
   The area, like Rhineland Pfalz, is the scene of frequent
low-level military training flights.
   Citizens and environmental groups have protested the flights,
saying they make life in the region unbearable.
   On Sunday a West German army helicopter crashed into a cliff in
Bavaria state, killing all nine aboard.
   On Friday, a civilian-owned airplane under contract with the
West German army crashed into a house in northern Germany, killing
the pilot.
   Also last week, three U.S. Air Force F-16s crashed in one day.
One pilot was killed when two jets collided in flight. U.S.
officials said the F-16s involved in those crashes were not on
low-level flight missions.

<HEAD>Hungarian Church Official Appeals To Preserve Romanian Villages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Hungarian church official has appealed
to the international community to pressure Romania into dropping a
village demolition project, the Austrian Catholic news service
Kathpress reported.
   The agency quoted Cardinal Laszlo Paskai, the Hungarian Catholic
primate, as saying the Romanian project would ``destroy the
culture, the history and hence the national identity'' of millions
of people.
   Under a plan unveiled by Romanian leader Nicolae Ceasuescu in
March, about 7,000 of Romania's 13,000 villages will be razed and
replaced by agricultural-industrial centers.
   The move would also affect hundreds of communities where many of
Romania's 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians live.
   The project led to an unofficial mass protest in downtown
Budapest June 27. Ceausescu, angered by the protest in the
Hungarian capital, closed a Hungarian consulate and ordered the
premises of a Hungarian cultural center vacated.
   Paskai said he was protesting not only in his own name but also
``in the name of the bishops, priests and the faithful.'' He said
he received petitions and letters indicating his concern was shared
by many Hungarians.
   ``Villages are more than just settlements of small groups of the
population, they are integral components of the entirety of a
country,'' Paskai said. ``The demolition of buildings, including
churches, means the destruction of historical and cultural values,
irrespective of which nationality is involved.''
   He called the Romanian plan ``all the more painful since it
occurs in a country with which we want to live in friendly
relations and with whose population we are bound by ties of
friendship and kinship.''

<TEXT>
   Canada's most controversial
premier, Dutch-born William Vander Zalm of British Columbia,
shrugged off the resignation of two senior ministers and announced
a major Cabinet shuffle Wednesday.
   ``Showing leadership often involves having to make tough
decisions,'' said Vander Zalm, a former tulip importer who owns and
lives at Fantasy Gardens amusement park outside Vancouver.
   In the past week, his government was shaken by the resignations
of Attorney General Brian Smith and Economic Development Minister
Grace McCarthy, both of whom fought Vander Zalm for leadership of
the Social Credit Party in 1986.
   The two complained of meddling by the premier's office and
accused Vander Zalm of an autocratic style of leadership.
   In the Cabinet shuffle, Vander Zalm removed a third former
rival, Highways Minister Stephen Rogers.
   Bud Smith, another old rival, was named attorney general.
   The first two years of Vander Zalm's five-year term have been
marked by controversy, although his conservative-leaning party has
a 22-seat majority in the provincial legislature.
   He was accused of interceding in a public bidding process on
behalf of a friend who wanted to buy the Expo `86 site in Vancouver.
   A Roman Catholic, he threatened to ban government funding for
abortions until a Supreme Court ruling struck down his policy. And
he suggested Christianity was the best means of improving the
health of schoolchildren.

   The Episcopalian House of Bishops rejected by
voice vote Wednesday a proposal that would have condemned
homosexuality as a failure of Christian ideals.
   The bishops' group, one of the two governing houses of the
church here this week for the church's 69th General Convention,
voted instead to call for a dialogue among churches on sexuality to
continue.
   The bishops, as a step toward setting policy for the 2.6 million
members of the Episcopal Church of the United States, endorsed a
resolution that affirmed traditional and biblical teachings of
chastity and fidelity, but omitted phrases concerning homosexuality.
   Some delegates complained that the House of Bishops did not act
decisively on the homosexuality issue.
   ``People within the church are hungry for a statement of
principle,'' said the Rev. C. Brinkley Morton, the bishop of San
Diego. ``Putting forth another study is sweeping the issue under
the carpet. It's a cop-out.''
   Liberal delegates were pleased by the House of Bishops action.
   ``The love between people of the same gender is as valid as the
love between a man and a woman,'' said the Rev. Paul Moore Jr.,
bishop of New York. ``Gay people going through the tragedy of AIDS
should not be denied the strength of an intimate relationship with
a person of the same sex.''
   Earlier, the presiding bishop of the convention called for
church leaders of all denominations to form personal relationships
with AIDS carriers.
   The Rt. Rev. Edmond L. Browning made the comment during a
healing service for AIDS patients, which was attended by about 650
people.

   Top Defense Department officials briefed
members of Congress behind closed doors Wednesday on the Navy's
downing of an Iranian jetliner, but key questions remained
unanswered even as lawmakers affirmed their support for the
commander who fired the missiles.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and other Pentagon officials
conducted the secret briefings for House and Senate members, who
characterized some of the information as confusing and said several
important details have yet to be unearthed.
   Administration officials said the cruiser Vincennes fired two
missiles in the Strait of Hormuz because it thought it was under
attack by an Iranian F-14 fighter. Instead, the missiles destroyed
Iran Air flight 655, killing all 290 people aboard in what
President Reagan termed a tragic accident.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said ``a lot of the questions that have come up ... are
going to have to await the technical data package'' of computer
records from the Vincennes.
   Nunn said the questions include electronic signals received by
the Vincennes from the jetliner, details of the warnings sent by
the ship, the jet's speed, altitude and whether it was descending
toward the ship as Pentagon officials have said.
   ABC News reported Wednesday that military sources who have
served in the Persian Gulf said Iranian commercial airliners have
been used to carry soldiers from Bandar Abbas _ the point of origin
for Iran Air flight 655 _ to the front with Iraq.
   The sources, who were not identified by ABC, said troop
transports often have carried both civilian and military
transponders, which are radar-activated devices that broadcast a
plane's identification signal. The sources said Iranian F-4 and
F-14 jets also have used both civilian and military transponders,
ABC reported.
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., ranking Republican on the Armed
Services panel, said ``we're still in the dark about a number of
things. There are a lot of things we don't know.''
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, said Pentagon officials told House members that U.S.
ships in the region had received specific intelligence warnings
that an attack on American forces was likely over the July 4
weekend. Those warnings heightened fears aboard the ship, he said.
   Aspin said a pair of F-14s had been moved from a military
airfield elsewhere in Iran to the joint military-civilian airfield
at Bandar Abbas.
   Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., said, ``the ship's captain had every
reason in the world to feel threatened. I don't think he had any
choice but to shoot it down.''
   The Washington Post reported in Thursday's editions that a
Post-ABC News poll of 524 adults found that 71 percent believed the
shooting down of the plane was justified while 23 percent
disagreed. Eighty percent said the captain acted properly in
ordering the plane's destruction.
   Poll respondents, by a 65 percent to 31 percent margin, approved
of how President Reagan is ``handling the situation involving the
U.S. Navy in the Persian Gulf.'' The telephone survey of randomly
selected adults in the continental United States was conducted
Tuesday and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage
points.
   Meanwhile, State Department officials said the United States
remains willing to open an ``authoritative dialogue'' with Iran to
discuss improving relations. Iran has expressed a similar interest
in return, said deputy spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley.
   She said the administration did not know yet whether the Iranian
messages arise from responsible officials.
   Mrs. Oakley said it would not be possible to have a normal
relationship with Iran as long as the Iran-Iraq war continues,
American hostages continue to be held by pro-Iranian militants in
Lebanon and Iran engages in international terrorism.
   As Congress returned from the Fourth of July recess, legislators
wanted to know what led Capt. Will C. Rogers 3rd to order the
Vincennes' missiles fired, but they refused to second-guess him.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said, ``The people
we have out there on those ships are in a very difficult, untenable
situation when they have to make judgments of that kind in such a
limited time frame.''
   ``It seem the decision was prudently made and one that I would
have made had I been in that situation,'' he said.
   Senate GOP leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said anyone tempted to
``Monday morning quarterbacking'' should ``remember the intense
pressure on a commander in combat.''
   He said they should also ``remember another American warship,
the Stark, and recollect the national anguish we endured when it
failed to defend itself against an apparent threatened attack.''
   A May 17, 1987 attack on the frigate Stark by a Iraqi warplane
in the gulf killed 37 U.S. sailors. Iraq said the attack was a case
of mistaken identity, an explanation accepted by the United States.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of a House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee on the Mideast, said, ``it looks to me as if the Navy
acted appropriately. I don't know what else they could have done.''
   Some lawmakers said the United States should consider
compensation to families of the victims. House Majority Leader
Thomas Foley, D-Wash., said compensation may be appropriate, ``not
as a matter of requirement, but as a matter of compassion and
conviction.''
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said there would be nothing to
preclude U.S. reparations, which he said would not constitute ``any
admission of guilt'' but would be ``an act of generosity.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said he had no idea when
the administration might decide on compensation but that it would
probably await the outcome of a Navy investigation into the downing
of the airliner.
   Fitzwater also said the United States hasn't received a response
from Iran to Reagan's message, sent through Swiss intermediaries,
that the United States had not intended to shoot down the airliner.
   Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., said the jet's downing should prompt
a re-examination of U.S. foreign policy in the region.
   And House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., said he left one
briefing feeling ``such a tragedy could happen again today or
tomorrow and we have no way of preventing it. The opportunity for
disaster is just sitting there waiting to happen.''
   The result, he said, means that ``We will probably end up with
American men and women dying as a result of this tragic accident
... The Iranian government is basically an irresponsible government
and you never know when they are going to retaliate or when.''
   Aspin said Wednesday that in a briefing Tuesday, Pentagon
officials had raised ``the possibility'' that a military
identification signal received by the Vincennes was sent by a
military jet and not the Iranian airliner.
   But a Navy spokesman, Lt. Brian Cullin, said, ``We do not
believe there was another aircraft in the area.''
   Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said the Vincennes' sophisticated
electronic equipment picked up transmissions from the jet on a
military frequency, leading the crew of the cruiser to think it was
firing at an Iranian F-14 fighter.
   ``We were told that there were three possibilities,'' said
Aspin. ``One is that the (airliner) had in fact been broadcasting
on both civilian and military frequencies; the second is the fact
that people on the Vincennes made a mistake in reading the
information, and the third is that there was a second plane that
was a military plane.''

   The Pentagon says the Iranian airliner shot
down by a Navy ship in the Persian Gulf was broadcasting on a
military channel, although officials privately acknowledge the jet
was in commercial airspace at the time of the incident.
   The Reagan administration said Tuesday that Capt. Will C. Rogers
III of the cruiser USS Vincennes thought his ship was under attack
in part because of conflicting identification signals sent from the
Iran Air A-300 Airbus.
   Pentagon spokesman Daniel Howard said some of the signals were
on a military frequency identified with F-14 fighter jets.

   Threats of total war and worldwide terrorism have issued from
Iran since the American cruiser Vincennes shot the jetliner down

   Michael Dukakis has a passion for order, but
choosing a vice presidential candidate is proving anything but an
orderly process he can carry out with a minimum of public scrutiny.
   Not until he clinched the Democratic presidential nomination on
June 7 would Dukakis even discuss the process by which he would
choose a running mate and then it was only to say it would be ``a
good, thoughtful, deliberative process.''
   But with interviews in Boston on Tuesday and Wednesday of three

   According to a new poll, the Massachusetts governor's

overwhelming margin, voters now say they have doubts about his
ability to run the state and campaign at the same time, and nearly
half say he should step down after the Democratic convention to
devote full time time to the campaign.

<HEAD>Americans See New Hope And Questions For Religion In Soviet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Some extraordinary warmth is showing up in the
Soviet Union's relations with religion, say American church leaders
who returned from last month's celebrations there of Chistianity's
millenium.
   But they add that just what the friendlier climate means in
practical implementation and lasting effect remains in question.
   ``As is true with many historical events, we won't know for
about 25 years what happened in Moscow,'' says Bishop Herbert W.
Chilstrom of Chicago, head of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in
America.
   ``It may be a `blip' on the screen that will have little
long-term significance, or it may go down as one of the great
milestone moments in Christian history.''
   In any case, the occasion was marked with fervor, crowds, the
return of various church properties, the presence of about 500
church leaders from other lands, all with cooperation and sometimes
participation of state officials.
   If anyone just a few years ago had said it could happen in that
officially atheist state, they'd have been laughed at, Chilstrom
says, but a change had come through Soviet leader Mikhail
S.Gorbachev.
   ``Don't expect that suddenly you're going to have a change of
180 degrees,'' says Chilstrom, among about 50 U.S. church leaders
who took part in the celebration.
   ``On the other hand, they seem to be trying to reinterpret
history. They seem to be saying that in this society, even though
it is officialy atheistic, the church has a right to exist and do
its work.''
   New York's Cardinal John O'Connor, one of 10 high-level Roman
Catholics present for the celebrations, says he is ``guardely
optimistic'' about the status of religion there.
   ``Unquestionably, something is happening,'' he says, citing the
extensive services, ceremonies and freedom of the celebration and
noting the return of numerous monastaries and churches to the
Russian Orthodox Church.
   But it remains uncertain whether it is genuine or just tactical
expediency, O'Connor says.
   He says it may be that Gorbachev merely ``feels he must relax
things'' for believers (70 million Orthodox, 9 million Roman
Catholics, 5 million Protestants) because ``he needs everybody's
help to get the economy going.''
   But if ``he is sincerely interested in opening Soviet society
because it should be open and if he has the belief as he says he
has, that there should be much broader religious freedom, then
there is hope.''
   The Rev. Joe Hale of Lake Junaluska, N.C., general secretary of
the World Methodist Council, who had previously visited the Soviet
Union five years ago, says he ``found this time a very different
climate.
   ``People were finally smiling, seemed happier.''
   He says the broadly enthusiastic celebration was especially
significant because it affirmed ``publicly the right of the church
to exist in the Soviet Union with integrity.''
   The government affirmed this, he says, by its meetings with
church officials, its hosting of a reception for about 800
celebrants at the Kremlin and presence of Gorbachev's wife, Raisa,
at a religious concert at the Bolshoi Theater.
   A speaker at that event, Rabbi Arthur Schneier of Manhattan's
Park East Synagogue, president of the interfaith Appeal of
Conscience Foundation, turned away from the audience at one point
to address her directly.
   He cited the Bible story of creation of Eve as helpmate to Adam
and told Mrs. Gorbachev:
   ``You are in sympathy with your husband's cause, and your
presence in our midst indicates your support of his pronouncements
on the rights of religious believers.''
   Evangelist Billy Graham, who preached to overflow crowds at
Orthodox and Baptist churches and who met with Soviet officials to
discuss changes in church-state relations, told one Baptist
congregation:
   ``You are entering a new period of history for the nation. In
past years, you faced many difficulties, but your faith has become
strong. There is enough faith and spirit in the Soviet Union for
you to help lead a revival throughout the world.''
   The Rev. Bruce Rigdon of McCormick Theological Seminary in
Chicago, an expert on Soviet religious affairs and a Presbyterian
leader at the celebration, says:
   ``We must remember that the church in the Soviet Union is
surrounded by all sorts of forces that would like to use it. The
church needs our prayers and our support to have the courage to
take advantage of what is possible for it.''
   Cardinal O'Connor says many uncertainties remain about the
developments there, and it would be naive to cast aside all
political skepticism, but he adds in his weekly column in the New
York Catholic:
   ``Something is happening in the Soviet union, something that
could be monumental for the world, for the wind blowing could be
the divine wind we call the Holy Spirit.''

   It's 5 p.m. on a Monday in Detroit, and disc
jockey Dave Wagner is shepherding motorists home with the usual
rush-hour mix of traffic reports, weather updates and short,
up-tempo compact disc recordings.
   ``Music of Mario Castel-Nuovo Tedesco,'' Wagner says as the
acoustic guitar piece ends. ``Say that 10 times real fast.''
   Also on the playlist are baroque piano renditions of ``Hey
Jude'' and ``All You Need Is Love'' from ``Bach Meets the Beatles''
and Stravinsky's ``Circus Polka'' _ ``possibly the only piece ever
written for an audience with peanuts on their breath,'' Wagner says.
   It's classical music. And Wagner and his colleagues at WQRS-FM
are taking a decidedly unclassical approach to presenting it.
   ``This place is a lot of yuks,'' he says.
   Wagner, 39, is no dilettante DJ-for-hire. He has a doctorate in
music from the University of Michigan, belongs to the American
Organists Society and is choirmaster at St. Paul's Roman Catholic
Church in Grosse Pointe Farms.
   But he's serious about dusting off classical music and making it
more appealing to a younger, increasingly affluent radio audience.
   ``I play mostly things in major keys _ short pieces, without a
lot of commentary,'' said Wagner, program director at WQRS and its
evening drive-time host since 1980.
   ``We're not only giving them reasons to listen. We're giving
them reasons not to turn us off.''
   WQRS is among the increasing numbers of commercial,
classical-format stations stressing entertainment and shedding
self-imposed roles as cultural custodians, according to Peter
Besheer, executive vice president of the New York-based Concert
Music Network.
   ``The adjective that would describe these newer stations would
be `friendly,''' he said. ``They would minimize talk and focus on
providing real emphasis on the music and introduce it in an
inviting way.
   ``By contrast, the old-line stations tend to be elitist, a bit
stuffy and believe they have a social obligation to make people
hear what they want them to hear. They view their job as to educate
the listener. The modern station is much less patronizing, less
paternalistic.''
   Some traditional listeners remain, including an older woman who
phones Wagner to say he incorrectly identified a Chopin piece as
``Opus 25'' instead of ``Opus 10.''
   ``It's the music police!'' yelps Wagner, jumping up to check the
label and tell the caller she is indeed correct. ``Only at a
classical station will people do that.''
   As for newer listeners, he says: ``This big yuppie generation is
growing up. ... They want to try something different besides the
Chuck Berry songs they grew up with.''
   Despite efforts at WQRS and elsewhere to broaden classical
music's appeal, the format never will dominate commercial radio.
   Of more than 10,000 U.S. stations, only 34 commercial outlets
broadcast classics full time, Besheer said. But more than half of
them have revamped their programming and their staffs in ways
similar to WQRS, he said.
   The Arbitron ratings service ranked WQRS 19th in the 26-station
Detroit market in the fall of 1987. But its majority owner, Boston
businessman Howard ``Woody'' Tanger, said ratings fail to reflect
the new listeners' affluence and their attractiveness to
advertisers.
   Between its founding in 1960 and 1985, when Tanger acquired it
for a reported $5 million, WQRS was run as a money-losing tax
shelter that carried as few as two ads an hour, Wagner said.
   Tanger said during a telephone interview that WQRS and its
sister station, WTMI-FM in Miami, are profitable. He declined to
give specific figures but said earnings from both will allow him to
acquire WFLN-FM in Philadelphia _ a traditional classical station.
That deal is pending.
   ``Our philosophy is simple _ we believe we play the `Top 40' of
classical music,'' Tanger said. ``We attempt to minimize the
chatter. We encourage our people on the air to be personalities. We
don't embrace the concept of teaching.
   ``We are still considered by some in the industry to be
renegades,'' Tanger said. ``But I know what we are doing is the
wave of the future.
   ``We do have listeners who alternate between AOR (album-oriented
rock), classic rock and classical music,'' he said. ``The two are
not inconsistent. Times have changed. ... we view every radio
station as a competitor.''
   ``A lot of people are coming to us straight from rock,'' Wagner
said. ``A lot of people say, `I've never listened to classical
music, but I like your approach and you don't make me feel stupid
when I listen to it.'
   ``Obviously, I do that by being stupider than anybody else.''

   In a land where weather vanes are akin to
crown jewels, city leaders and firefighters are at odds over a
gilded prize that foretold the winds of New Hampshire's capital
city for roughly a century.
   The treasure is a meticulously detailed 4-foot-long, horse-drawn
fire wagon, cast in copper and covered in gold leaf.
   With manes and tails flying, two strong horses race ahead of the
big-wheeled wagon equipped with kerosene lanterns, nozzles, a
wood-fired steam boiler and pumping equipment. One helmeted fireman
holds the taut reins. A second stokes the boiler.
   The Cushing & White Co. of Waltham, Mass., no longer in
business, designed the vane around 1871 for $200, a sum then
representing about half the cost of a working man's home. Experts
today believe the vane could fetch $100,000.
   The vane graced the cupola of Concord's main fire station until
1980 when firefighters, without consulting city leaders, took it
down and put it in a room full of firefighting memorabilia in the
city's south-end station.
   The firefighters took it into protective custody because weather
vane thieves were active and because the city planned to sell the
main fire station to a developer, said fire department Lt. Robert
Constant.
   The vane issue has surfaced periodically, with firefighters
opposing city efforts to have the treasure again grace the Concord
skyline.
   ``This is a valuable part of the firefighters' heritage and it
belongs with us. No one can protect it like we can,'' said Wayne
Nickerson, a firefighter for 13 years.
   ``We don't pay the firefighters to be custodians of antiques. We
pay them to put out fires and to save lives, and they are very good
at that,'' said Martin Gross, a prominent Concord lawyer and the
city's mayor when the vane came down.
   The dispute flared anew recently when Mayor Elizabeth Hager
decided the vane belonged to the city.
   Hager said she was first drawn to the vane in the 1970s while
hawk-watching with her children, who learned to focus their
binoculars by training them on the intricate detail of the horses
and wagon.
   ``I was heartbroken when it came down,'' Hager said. ``And
recently, I just decided we should stop futzing around and get it
back up where it belongs.''
   Weather vanes are popular with thieves in New England, a region
once crowded with copper rooftop art depicting rural life in the
form of animals, farm equipment and other bucolic symbols. Many of
the most valuable vanes have been replaced with replicas, the
originals placed under lock-and-key in museums or private
collections.
   It is ``deceptively simple'' to steal vanes, said Samuel
Pennington, publisher of the Maine Antique Digest. Vanes turn on a
spindle and need only be lifted inches to remove them, he said.
   In 1983, Pennington helped find and recover a valuable weather
vane stolen from atop the fire station in Hallowell, a tiny
antique-filled town in central Maine.
   As for putting Concord's vane back on a roof, Pennington thinks
it akin to ``tying 10 ten-thousand-dollar bills up there and daring
someone to steal them.''
   Two fire department vanes similar to Concord's in age and style
disappeared during the renovation of buildings in Nashua and
Manchester. The Manchester vane was discovered six years ago in a
museum in Shelburne, Vt. The Nashua vane has not been found.
   Not taking any chances, Concord firefighters recently wired
their one-room museum with an ear-splitting alarm guaranteed to
catch the attention of the 20 men and women assigned to the station.
   The firefighters encourage visitors to come see the vane along
with the fire photos, records, badges and helmets on display.
   But seeing the vane means catching the firefighters between
engagements, which is not the city councilors' idea of public
access.
   Last month, the councilors unanimously ordered the firefighters
to relinquish the vane. This month, they rescinded the order and
formed a study committee.
   Both sides appear to be moving toward creation of a replica that
would foretell the winds from the roof of the original fire
station, now an office building.
   Hager said she would have no problem with a replica if
firefighters paid for it. Constant said firefighters are
considering how to raise the roughly $5,000 needed for the process.
   ``We probably wouldn't have it golded over though, because that
would just be an incentive to steal the replica,'' Constant said.
   While a replica would solve one issue _ returning a scenic view
to taxpayers _ it may be awhile before the fate of the crown jewel
itself is resolved.
   ``We don't want an argument, but the vane belongs with the
firefighters,'' Constant said.
   To which Hager replied, ``Oh, there won't be any argument; the
weather vane belongs to the city.''

<HEAD>Mutual Funds: Plan How To Get Out Before You Get In</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Before you commit your money to a mutual fund
investment, check out the exits.
   That's a lesson many savers and investors have learned in the
past couple of years, with volatility in the financial markets
running especially high.
   The typical modern-day mutual fund may have as many as half a
dozen ways to cash in _ or redeem _ shares, and it stands ready to
do so at any time you wish. Thus, if you think of your holdings in
a mutual fund as a very liquid investment, you are correct _ with
some caveats.
   In fast-moving situations like the one that occurred on Black
Monday last Oct. 19, a fund's telephone switching or redemption
privilege may not prove to be as fast and convenient as you
expected, if you have trouble getting through a traffic jam of
calls from other fund shareholders.
   The best time to deal with any such potential problems, advisers
in matters of personal finance say, is before they have a chance to
happen _ in other words, at the time you make your first investment
in a fund.
   ``Investors can lay the groundwork for fast and hassle-free
share redemption,'' says Jonathan Pond in the Wiesenberger Mutual
Funds Investment Report newsletter.
   ``The prospectus contains information on a fund's redemption
rules. Read it closely. You may find language about minimum holding
periods, minimum balance requirements, exchange fees or annual
limits on share exchanges.
   ``If you are not clear on such items, call the fund's service
phone and probe until you understand the fund's policies.''
   The old, low-tech way to redeem shares _ still in wide use _ is
by letter, including explicit instructions, your account number,
and a signature that matches exactly the name in which the account
is registered.
   In many situations, funds require that this signature be
guaranteed by a commercial bank or brokerage firm.
   Nowadays most funds also handle redemption orders by telephone,
bank wire transfer, or in person at their offices.
   In addition, some discount brokerage firms offer to buy and sell
fund shares for you, collecting a commission that comes atop any
redemption or exchange fees charged by the fund itself.
   One popular way to cash in shares is to use a fund group's
``telephone switch'' program, moving from a stock or bond fund into
a money market fund.
   Most money funds, and indeed some bond funds as well, allow you
to redeem shares by simply writing a check.
   When you fill out an application to open a fund account, you are
normally asked to choose which if any of these extra features you
want to avail yourself of.
   Says Pond: ``It never hurts to sign up for all the services a
fund offers. Someday they could come in handy.''
   It also pays to bear in mind that any redemption from a fund
whose shares fluctuate in value is what accountants call a
``taxable event.'' When you cash in, you realize a capital gain or
loss for tax purposes.
   If you are dealing with a loss, warns William Brennan, an
investment adviser in Valley Forge, Pa., watch out for a trap that
can be sprung by the Internal Revenue Service's ``wash sale'' rule.
   This can arise when investors have instructed funds to reinvest
their dividends or capital gains distributions in new fund shares.
   If you write a check against fund shares within 30 days of such
a distribution and reinvestment, you might forfeit the right to
deduct on your tax return some or all of the loss realized on the
shares you redeemed.
   Says Brennan: ``Before you write a check, determine when the
next dividend payment is due.''

<HEAD>Minimum Wage, Politics and Economics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Almost any day of the week you may find
instances of where politics and economics clash, but none with more
noise than when minimum-wage legislation is the subject.
   So high are the political decibels that some economists claim
judgment is skewed. According to some politicians, so cold is the
economic logic that it is bereft of human dimensions.
   But whether the perspective is mainly political or economic
might be far less important than another aspect of minimum-wage
proposals _ that they might not help those they are intended to
help.
   That is the contention of economist William Dunkelberg, who has
studied, consulted and lectured intensively on the subject. ``The
minimum wage is earned primarily by secondary earners from
above-median income families,'' he states.
   Low-income workers, says Dunkelberg, account for only a bit more
than 10 percent of all workers earning the minimum wage. And in
retailing, a major employer of lower-wage workers, 70 percent of
recipients are from families with incomes more than 200 percent
above the threshhold poverty level.
   Citing statistics such as these, Dunkelberg states unequivocally
that minimum-wage legislation ``cannot effectively redistribute
income to the poor.'' Most beneficiaries, he says, are people we
aren't trying to help.
   ``Trying to help the less-advantaged is an admirable goal and
one that we all probably support,'' says the professor, formerly of
Stanford and Purdue universities and now dean of the graduate
business school at Temple University.
   He continues: ``Let's do it efficiently, not with the shot-gun
approach of a minimum wage that is destined to miss its target nine
out of 10 times while imposing substantial economic costs on us
all.''
   In fact, he continues, a system already exists that could do
even better for the poor. He explains:
   ``States alone devote an amount to public welfare programs that,
if distributed directly to the poorest 10 percent of all families
in the United States, would yield more than $12,000 per family a
year.''
   Dunkelberg points out that benefits of that level would be much
higher than congressional proposals to raise the minimum wage from
$3.35 an hour in three annual steps to between $4.25 and $4.55 in
1991.
   Already many workers employed in what used to be minimum-wage
jobs earn far more than that in areas of New England and
California, a consequence of thriving economies marked by unusually
low unemployment.
   Dunkelberg opposes minimum-wage legislation for other reasons
too, among them:
   _Most workers earn the minimum wage for only short periods of
their lives, advancing to higher paying jobs as their skills
improve.
   _What he perceives to be a threat to the hiring capabilities of
very small businesses, where many unskilled workers obtain their
first job experience.
   _His belief that raising the minimum wage would add to
inflation, albeit by only a fractional amount.
   _His contention that the increases proposed would add to
unemployment _ again, however, by only a tiny amount.
   But, he concludes, those tiny percentages are meaningful. They
add up.
   ``The adverse employment effects don't bother most of us _ just
those with few skills, poor educations, unlucky draws in the
genetic lottery and young people.''
   He asks: Aren't these the people we hope to help?

<HEAD>American Painter Promotes Black-Jewish Dialogue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONI RABIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paul Collins has painted old Arab women,
Yemenite Jews, Ethiopian immigrants, nuns and Israel's first female
general.
   He has captured the pathos of Holocaust survivors on canvas, the
panorama of tent encampments of nomadic Bedouin tries and the
desert fortress of Masada.
   The black American painter came to Israel to promote a
black-Jewish dialogue. The Arab uprising, he says, has deepened the
rift between the two groups and made his job more difficult.
   Collins, who recently opened an exhibition of his paintings at
the Hilton Hotel in Jerusalem, said two major black organizations
have urged him to return to the United States because of Israel's
crackdown on Palestinian protesters in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   Collins, a former civil rights activist who has lived in Israel
for two years, said he chose instead to go on a lecture tour in
American schools and churches to explain why he stayed.
   ``There are so many layers to this country, that anyone who
dismisses it and says they don't like Israel, doesn't really know
the country,'' the artist said in an interview. ``I've fallen
hopelessly in love.''
   Collins, of Grand Rapids, Mich., began painting in 1944 when he
was 16 years old. He has had no formal art training and never went
to college.
   However, he has exhibited at Avery Fisher Hall in New York; the
Illinois State Museum in Springfield, Ill.; the Corcoran Museum in
Washington; the Museum of Natural History in Detroit; and the
Chicago Cultural Center.
   His oils fetch from $25,000 to $40,000, and his drawings sell
for as much as $8,000. Lithographs fetch $300.
   Most of his paintings are done in a realistic style, but others
have a surrealistic, symbolic quality.
   ``Cousins in Conflict,'' for example, is a portrait of two
faceless men joined at the arm like Siamese twins. One wears a
yarmulke, the skullcap often worn by Jewish men and boys. The other
wears a kefiyeh headdress, a symbol of Arab nationalism.
   The centerpiece of the 30-piece exhibit, ``The Faces of
Israel,'' is a bright collage of images of Arabs and Jews, created
to celebrate Israel's 40th anniversary. Some of the proceeds will
go toward promoting tourism to Israel, Collins said.
   Although tensions between American blacks and Jews have
heightened in recent years, Collins said the rift ``is not as deep
as the press and politicians would have us believe.''
   ``There's one thing we have in common: If you're anti-Semitic,
you also hate blacks,'' said the 50-year-old artist, a native of
Grand Rapids, Mich.
   Collins also said he felt he was returning a debt to the Jewish
people who were among the most ardent supporters of the black civil
rights struggle in the United States.
   However, he has been criticized by black leaders in the United
States for working in Israel.
   Collins came to Israel two years ago with his wife, Candace, and
daughter, Chauvon, to learn more about the country.
   He spent from 1968 to 1970 in Senegal painting traditional
African life and later worked for three years at Wounded Knee,
S.D., painting American Indians.
   His new exhibit will tour a dozen U.S. cities next year under
the auspices of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai Brith.

<TEXT>
   Matilde Nunez gripped the
edge of her wooden chair and strained to watch the little girl as
she grabbed her ruffled skirts and sashayed across the stage.
   ``That's it, bonita, that's the way to do it,'' wailed the proud
aunt of 7-year-old Manuela Nunez, whose dancing stole the show at
an outdoor performance about Spanish Gypsy life. ``That's the way
to keep it alive.''
   Keeping flamenco alive is what both the brand-new Andalucian
Flamenco Foundation and Matilde Nunez want to do.
   She and her gypsy family and neighbors in Jerez's Santiago
neighborhood don't have much time for lectures on the evolution of
the ``cante hondo'' _literally, the song from the depth of the soul
_ or any arguing about the origin of the word flamenco.
   But they do turn out in force, complete with bottles of sherry,
ham sandwiches and babies, for ``This Way of Life,'' a show that
tells the story of Spanish gypsies through dancing, singing, guitar
playing and hand-clapping in a style that has come to characterize
the rhythm of southern Spain.
   The show by author Tomas Rodriguez-Pantoja and director Manuel
Morao features many Jerez gypsies and was the highlight of a
conference in June, ``Two Centuries of Flamenco,'' sponsored by the
foundation _ its first official activity since inauguration in May.
   To conserve the memory of flamenco, to promote research into the
art and to make contemporary flamenco known to as wide a public as
possible are the principal aims of the foundation, according to
director Joaquin Carrera.
   The foundation, housed in a refurbished 18th century mansion in
the heart of the Santiago neighborhood _ the shrine of flamenco for
many _ has a record, video and book library as well as a dance
hall. It has a $350,000 budget.
   ``Flamenco itself is a world of conflict,'' said Carrera.
``Flamencologists have a tendency to expostulate, not to ask
questions, and we thought this might take up too much time,
especially for the foreigners who were attending.''
   When a Mexican conference attendee asked about the meaning of
the word flamenco, there was an embarrassed silence, as though
someone had asked about the origin of the word Christian in a
church.
   But Bernard Leblon, professor of Gypsy and Andalucian culture at
the French University of Perpignan, offered the explanation that
the term referred to the gypsies who had been forced into military
service in the fife and drum corps of the Spanish regiments
fighting in Flanders in the Low Countries in the 17th century.
Flamenco is the Spanish word for a Fleming or a native of Flanders.
   Another theory has it that the word derives from the Arabic
``fela-mengh,'' or immigrant peasant and that many of the
``cantes'' or styles of flamenco songs were influenced by the Moors
who occupied most of Spain for eight centuries.
   Although opinion varies over the current health of flamenco,
most ``flamencologists'' concur that the art form was first pulled
from near oblivion by Spanish composer and musician Manuel de Falla
in June 1922 when he organized a ``cante hondo'' contest in Granada.
   Late 19th century Spanish intellectuals such as Jose Ortega y
Gasset had declared flamenco vulgar and looked to northern Europe
for their musical inspiration.
   After fierce suppression following the 1936-39 Spanish Civil
War, flamenco was appropriated by the authoritarian regime of Gen.
Francisco Franco.
   The subsequent stylization of flamenco forms in staged shows and
films contributed much to the cliche of the ``Spain of the
tambourine and castanets'' so rejected by Spanish youth who began
to look to foreign music as an expression of rebellion and
independence.
   The publication of ``Flamencologia'' by Anselmo Gonzalez Climent
in 1957 marked the acceptance, once again, by the intelligentsia of
flamenco as a basic element in Spanish culture.
   A contest the year before in Cordoba for ``cantaores,'' singers
of flamenco, also renewed interest.
   But many students of the art point out that flamenco is not
universally popular in Spain and that many Spaniards are
embarrassed by foreign assumptions that flamenco is the nation's
national music.
   Critic Angel Alvarez Caballero says flamenco has serious
box-office problems. In a country where some 100 flamenco festivals
are held each summer, half lose money and few would be possible
without the support of local city or provincial councils. In
Madrid, where 20 public flamenco taverns existed a decade ago, only
five or six remain.
   Many aficionados have taken refuge in ``penas'' or private
flamenco clubs that invite artists to perform regularly,
perpetuating the essentially intimate nature of the art.
   Leblon, who places himself on the side that argues the
determinant gypsy role in flamenco history, says he believes many
Spaniards cannot accept flamenco as a serious art form because of
its gypsy connections.
   But many of flamenco's most celebrated performers such as
guitarist Paco de Lucia and ``cantaor'' Antonio Fernandez Diaz
``Fosforito'' are not even gypsies.

<HEAD>Planters Spruce Up Treeless Aleutian Islands</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ADAK, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's just a ragged clump of stunted spruce,
but the Adak National Forest is nothing short of inspirational to
foresters who dream of covering the desolate Aleutian Islands with
trees.
   Measuring scarcely 40 feet across, the ``forest'' consists of 33
trees huddled on a windy hillside near the Adak Naval Air Station.
A sign by the road proclaims, ``You are now entering and leaving
Adak National Forest.''
   The trees, none over 17 feet tall, are hardy survivors of a
World War II plan to boost the morale of homesick GIs stationed in
the Aleutians, one of the world's longest stretches of unforested
land.
   Thousands of seedlings were planted along the 1,100-mile island
chain, yet few took hold, and fewer still have survived the long
winters, cold summers and relentless winds.
   So the humble Adak National Forest is a model for hopeful tree
lovers who are tending a new crop of seedlings this summer in the
Aleutians. This time, they say, they'll do things right.
   ``It's history in the making. One of these days the Aleutians
will be forested,'' said Richard Tindall of Anchorage, a forestry
consultant and volunteer for ReTree International, an Oregon-based
group that plants trees around the world.
   It's not as if the Aleutians never had trees. Huge sequoias grew
here in the Miocene Epoch, 11 million to 25 million years ago. But
volcanic eruptions, a changing climate and grinding glaciers
toppled that forest, and the Aleutians have been treeless since the
last ice age ended 10,000 years ago. All that's left of the
sequoias are petrified trunks, up to 9 feet in diameter, embedded
in beaches and cliffs.
   Some foresters believe the Aleutians would reforest naturally,
given another 50,000 years or so. Since the glaciers' retreat,
Sitka spruce trees have spread from British Columbia, up through
southeastern Alaska and around the coast toward the Aleutians.
   Studies of pollen in peat bogs show the spruce reached the
northern tip of Kodiak Island and nearby Alaska Peninsula 400 to
500 years ago, said U.S. Forest Service researcher John Alden.
Kodiak Island's southern half is still mostly treeless.
   Old-timers in the city of Kodiak remember open fields where the
forest now stands. The grassy slopes south of town are dotted with
fat little spruce.
   But as the forest nears the Aleutians, the march is slowed by
dry winds, cool temperatures and thick grass that smothers tree
seedlings. Alden figures the forest now migrates one mile per
century.
   That's not nearly fast enough for some. A lack of trees never
seemed to bother the native Aleuts, but the urge to plant has been
rooted among newcomers since the first Russian explorers.
   Russians planted the first trees in 1805 near the eastern
Aleutian village of Unalaska; a few still survive and enjoy
National Historic Landmark status.
   Whalers, traders and missionaries planted seedlings at
settlements scattered along the chain. But it wasn't until World
War II, when lonely soldiers pined for winter greenery, that
large-scale plantings were done.
   After the war, planting was sporadic. Alden said about 4,000
trees were planted on Adak in 1976 as a bicentennial project, but
most died.
   Tree planters hope the latest plantings fare better.
   The Navy and U.S. Forest Service have spent $30,000 since 1985
trying to find trees suited to Adak. Alden has overseen the
planting of nearly 6,000 seedlings, including 120 this spring.
   But the federal program's funding was cut, leaving things up to
ReTree International, now in its fourth year of Aleutian plantings.
Tindall said 2,000 seedlings will be planted this summer with the
help of volunteers in five Aleutian and southwestern Alaska
communities.
   Not everyone shares Tindall's preference for trees over native
Aleutian grasses and arctic alpine plants.
   ``There are always those who wonder about bringing in something
that isn't natural,'' he said. ``But most people understand that
the only reason there aren't trees in a lot of these places is
because nature hasn't had time to come in.''
   Planting trees where none grew before can be educational, said
David Bruce, a retired forester who directed the World War II
plantings as an Army captain.
   ``If you learn to do it under these very unfavorable conditions,
you're much better able to plant trees under better conditions,''
Bruce said. ``Another reason for the interest is just to see if you
can do it _ sort of like climbing mountains.''

<HEAD>Maryland, Virginia GOP Field Black Candidates in Tough Senate
Races</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maryland and Virginia Republicans are fielding
little-known black candidates in uphill Senate races, apparently to
help build bridges to a traditionally Democratic constituency. But
some observers say the tactic is likely to backfire.
   The Maryland party is putting up Alan L. Keyes, a 37-year-old
Harvard-educated businessman with conservative views and a gift for
rousing rhetoric. Keyes emerged as the likely nominee on June 25
after the victor in the party's nine-way primary bowed out.
   In Virginia, Republicans are offering Maurice A. Dawkins, 67, a
retired Washington-area preacher and lobbyist who claimed the
nomination after a stirring speech to delegates at the Republican
state convention.
   Common ground for the two candidates extends beyond their
speechmaking ability. Both are relative newcomers to elective
politics, and both face daunting opponents _ popular incumbent Sen.
Paul Sarbanes in Maryland and former Gov. Charles Robb in Virginia.
The political strength of both Democrats scared off more
experienced GOP prospects.
   That strength also virtually guarantees that Keyes and Dawkins,
the only two blacks running for the Senate this year, will not
crack the chamber's color barrier. The only black to be elected to
the Senate in this century was Edward W. Brooke, R-Mass., who
served from 1967 to 1979.
   But Republicans hope the two men can at least stir up excitement
this election season and change the mix of voters in the Republican
column.
   ``They have that tremendous speaking ability that can ignite a
group and galvanize the party in ways that don't require a lot of
money,'' said Tom Mason, a spokesman for the Republican Party's
national Senate campaign arm.
   ``They're dynamic personalities. They'll form a little bit
different coalition ... hopefully a little bit broader'' than would
other potential candidates, he said.
   Mason emphasized that the broader appeal is not part of a
national GOP strategy. The national party did not recruit either
man, he said, but both ``came up on their own, naturally, through
Republican ranks.''
   However, the similarities in the two neighboring states do raise
at least the appearance that the party is using the two candidates
for its own goals in a situation where victory is only a remote
possibility.
   ``If it appears to be some kind of cynical attempt to use
minority candidates in an effort to say they have them, but in
races that appear to be unwinnable, it could backfire,'' said Anita
Dunn, spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
   One political analyst sees that as a real danger.
   ``There are a lot of things the GOP can do to attract black
voters and build bridges to the black community,'' said Charles
Cook, publisher of a newsletter on politics.
   ``The way not to do it is to take a nomination that isn't worth
anything because of the political situation and give it to someone
who under normal circumstances would not be able to get it, and
hand it to them when they are just going to get crucified,'' Cook
said.
   Neither Cook nor Dunn sees much prospect that black voters will
flock to the Republican column because of the choice of GOP
nominees. In Maryland, Democrats have a 2-to-1 registration
advantage. In Virginia, a recent poll gave Robb a 4-to-1 lead over
Dawkins.
   Cook points to the 1986 governor's race in Michigan, where
William Lucas, a black Republican county official, garnered just 31
percent of the vote against incumbent Democrat James Blanchard. The
GOP vote was the lowest in 150 years.
   ``I don't know that the Republican Party is stronger in Michigan
as a result of that, or that relations between blacks and the party
are better off,'' Cook said. ``I don't know what purpose it serves
... Maybe it's trying to cure by symbolism a substantive problem.''
   Mason calls that explanation ``really reaching.''
   ``I think these fellows were not nominated on the basis of their
race, but on the basis of their capabilities as a Senate
candidate,'' he said. ``To say they are only black candidates is to
really insult them.''

<TEXT>
   Paulino Esteban's knowledge of reed-boat
building, a craft handed down in his family for centuries high up
in the Andes on Lake Titicaca, has made him virtually indispensible
to modern-day explorers like Thor Heyerdahl.
   An Aymara Indian, Esteban was one of the key builders of the
reed boat Ra II that Heyerdahl sailed across the Atlantic in 1970
from Morocco to Barbados in an attempt to prove that similar boats
could have been used thousands of years before Columbus by
Egyptians to reach the Western Hemisphere.
   More recently Esteban built another reed boat for an attempt by
a group of Spaniards to show that early Incas could also have
sailed the Pacific.
   He fashioned a 70-foot sailboat entirely from bulrushes called
totora that grow wild in his native Lake Titicaca, which is about
three times the size of Rhode Island 12,500 feet up in Andes
between Peru and Bolivia.
   The rough-hewn vessel, with the color and texture of golden
straw, conjurs visions of Inca mariners sailing into the Pacific _
precisely what Heyerdahl theorizes and what five Spanish
adventurers are attempting to help substantiate now on their
attempted 7,200-mile voyage to New Zealand from Peru.
   The 12-ton craft is a giant version of the totora boats that
have plied Titicaca for centuries and are still widely used on the
lake.
   Esteban said the ocean boat's bow, rising 16 feet to blunt heavy
seas, is the most noticeable departure from the traditional craft.
   ``I believe my forefathers sailed on the ocean,'' the
59-year-old builder added in an interview. ``The remains of reed
boats have been found all along the shorelines.''
   Although he has been building totora boats ``purely from
memory'' since he was a boy, Esteban said he had never seen nor
heard of ocean-going reed craft until Heyerdahl summoned him in
1970 for Ra II.
   ``The system of design was so simple and yet so ingenious, I
know of no other tribe or individual who would be able to duplicate
it,'' Heyerdahl said of Esteban and his crew in his book ``The Ra
Expeditions.''
   Heyerdahl, a Norwegian anthropologist, recently returned to
Peru, the cradle of his theories on ancient man's migrations, and
met with Esteban and the Spaniards at the seashore near Lima where
the Pacific boat was being built.
   Heyerdahl watched as Esteban and seven other Titicaca Indians
wove and tied the thin reeds into bundles the size of telephone
poles.
   The craftsmen later joined the bundles with ropes, converting
the reeds into a massive hull that tapered toward the arching bow
and stern. Other workers built a bamboo deck cabin and two masts.
   ``There are no more builders in the world like me. My name is in
the history books,'' Esteban said referring to his being mentioned
in Heyerdahl's writings.
   The Spaniards, headed by Kitin Munoz, 29, sailed for New Zealand
on June 29 from Lima. They are following the course charted in 1947
by Heyerdahl on his voyage from Peru to Polynesia on the balsa raft
Kon-Tiki.
   Heyerdahl's voyages were aimed at demonstrating that Peruvian
Indians could have colonized Pacific islands and that other ancient
sailors spread their culture from the Middle East thousands of
years ago.
   After Ra I broke up on heavy seas in his first attempt in 1969
to sail from Morocco to South America, Heyerdahl sought out Estaban
on Lake Titicaca. The Indians' life style and their reliance on
reed boats to travel and fish had changed little since early Inca
times.
   Esteban helped build Ra II from papyrus reeds in Morocco, and
Heyerdahl sailed it in 1970 for 3,200 miles and 57 days to Barbados
in the Caribbean.
   Esteban was summoned again by Heyerdahl seven years later to
build the Tigris, a ship made from a reeds that grow in the marshes
of Iraq, where ancient Sumarians lived.
   Heyerdahl sailed the Tigris 4,200 miles down the Persian Gulf in
1978 to Pakistan and across the Arabian Sea to Djibouti in
northeast Africa. There he and his crew burned the craft to protest
what they called ``unhuman elements'' in the world, because Tigris
was barred from ports in North Yemen and Ethiopia.
   The intent of that expedition was to see how far the Sumarians
could have gone in their early reed boats.
   Esteban said the boat he built for the Spaniards should remain
buoyant for the five months it takes it reach New Zealand.
   In Titicaca's icy waters, the 10-foot totora boats become water
logged and rot in about a year.
   Esteban said the Spaniards' boat, called Uru after an ancient
tribe that once lived on Lake Titicaca, would probably be his last
ocean-going craft.
   He said he plans to retire on Suriqui, his home island on the
Bolivian side of Titicaca where he runs a museum of his work and
Heyerdahl's travels. He also weaves and sells model reed boats to
tourists.
   His sons Fermin 22, and Porfirio, 12, helped build the Uru along
with Esteban's two brothers and three nephews.
   But Esteban alone understands the construction of large boats.
He worries that no one will continue building them and that even
the knack of weaving the traditional lake boats may someday be
forgotten.
   ``I want my children to learn this art,'' he said. ``But the
Indians of Titicaca don't want to. Everyone wants wooden boats
now.''

   Spent vials herald a robust trade in crack.
Prostitutes turn tricks in stairwells. Robberies, beatings and even
killings are everyday risks. Amid the hostility and crime of New
York's hotels for the homeless, hundreds of expectant mothers mark
time.
   These women face double jeopardy, fending for a place to live
while luckless life grows inside them.
   Their babies die at twice the rate of other infants in the city.
Of the survivors, often underweight and fallen behind even before
they get started, many never recover. Many of the women are unaware
of the medical help available or ignorant of its need.
   They're usually single heads of households with two or three
children already. They have welfare checks to fetch, apartments to
seek and meager meals to cook on hotplates. Those grim priorities
come before prenatal care, nutrition, vitamins, rest and hygiene.
   ``These are high-risk pregnancies,'' said Dr. Philip Brickner of
St. Vincent's Hospital, which provides free care for the pregnant
and homeless. ``Without prenatal care, there's a relatively high
risk of a premature baby or a damaged baby, both of which lead to
enormous health expense.''
   ``It's a time bomb,'' said Dana Hughes, senior health specialist
with the Children's Defense Fund in Washington, D.C. ``The baby
born to a pregnant, homeless woman is at tremendous disadvantage if
it happens to survive.''
   Dabbing tears with toilet paper, hotel resident Juanita Williams
talked about a daughter born in December. Too busy with her other
children, she neglected prenatal care. The child, her 10th, was
born with spina bifida, a congenital defect of the nervous system
that doctors say can be related to drug or alcohol abuse early in a
pregnancy.
   ``I wonder if she'd be OK if I would have gotten better care. I
was on the run so much,'' the 42-year-old mother said. ``This is
not living. I don't even know if it's surviving. It's no place to
raise a child. You have to take it one day at a time and pray you
get out of this hell.''
   Efforts by the city, state and volunteers to reach these fragile
tenants are complicated by sheer numbers. In five years, the
homeless population has exploded and overwhelmed a stopgap shelter
system that scatters them all over the city. In that wave came
scores of pregnant women.
   New York leads the nation with 28,000 homeless, according to the
city's Human Resources Administration, and spends $312 million,
about 6 percent of its $4.9 billion annual budget, to care for
them. The city doesn't know how many homeless women are pregnant,
but estimates by the Legal Aid Society and the Coalition for the
Homeless put the number at 500 to 800.
   Because the city doesn't have enough private rooms in its 29
shelters, most get emergency housing in a network of 55 hotels,
some filled with welfare recipients while others are shared with
tourists. The city, acknowledging hotels make rotten shelters,
hopes to get out of them by 1993.
   Since 1986, the city has been under court order not to house
pregnant women or mothers with newborns in barracks-style shelters
where they can be exposed to such contagious ailments as measles
and respiratory infection.
   Advocates had argued the women should have private rooms. They
didn't bargain for the wretched conditions in welfare hotels.
   Four people may share a room as small as 9-by-12-feet furnished
with two bunk beds but lacking chairs or a table for meals. Paint
peels from walls and ceilings. Food is strung on ropes to keep it
from rats and roaches.
   Not all bathrooms are private. Afraid their children may catch a
disease or be molested in a communal toilet, some mothers make
their youngsters relieve themselves in plastic potties or empty
cans.
   ``The city's cure is perhaps worse than the disease,'' said
Arthur Fried of the Legal Aid Society.
   Nevertheless, some homeless women, desperate to escape
congregate shelters and knowing pregnant women get private rooms,
offer to buy urine from pregnant women. The city tests urine to
verify pregnancy, and a positive screening can mean a room alone
instead of a crowded floor.
   ``One girl said she'd pay me $5 for a sample of my urine because
she wanted a private room. She was strung out on drugs and she
wanted to do them in privacy,'' said Tracie Dillard, 22, who at
eight months pregnant was staying at a city shelter in Brooklyn.
   Urine sales do occur, city officials said, but followup
pregnancy tests have not found any cheaters.
   ``I'm sure it's happened,'' said Gail Gordon, first deputy
administrator of adult services for the Human Resources
Administration. ``But it's not the norm. If it did happen, my
goodness, how sad.''
   Medically and financially, being homeless and pregnant produces
a harsh principle of pay now or pay more later.
   Infants born to mothers who lived in welfare hotels during
pregnancy had a death rate of 25 per 1,000 births, according to a
1984 study by the city's Health Department. That's more than double
the city rate and 2.5 times higher than the national rate of 10
deaths per 1,000 births.
   Without prenatal care, babies are at least three times more
likely to have birth weights of less than 5 pounds, which means
they'll need followup care, according to the Children's Defense
Fund.

   Prenatal care, which regularly checks an expectant mother's
pulse, blood pressure, weight and nutrition, costs $800 to $1,200.
After birth, a month's stay in a neonatal intensive care unit can
cost $300,000.
   Marjorie Gish, a registered nurse at the Lamb's Church prenatal
care clinic, said the plight of the city's homeless, pregnant women
reminded her of her Peace Corps days in a Mayan village in Belize,
where shoeless women walked through open pigsties and bathed in a
stream.
   There, however, the chief, convinced of the need, ordered
pregnant women to get regular checkups _ a power that no authority
wields in the largest city in the world's wealthiest nation.
   ``Care was more readily available in the village. The homeless
and pregnant in New York are probably worse off than the women
receiving care in Third World countries,'' said Mrs. Gish.
   The children who survive have dim prospects of a normal life.
   ``They are the closest things you can find to refugee
populations in underdeveloped countries,'' said Dr. Irwin Redlener
of New York Hospital, which provides pediatric care for the
homeless through donations by singer Paul Simon and New York
Yankees slugger Don Mattingly.
   ``They are disenfranchised, cut off and undernourished. A lot of
kids are not going to recover from the psychological trauma they've
experienced,'' Redlener said.
   ``You end up with a lost generation of children,'' said Stephen
Banks, a lawyer with the Legal Aid Society.
   The average homeless, pregnant woman is 27 years old, a high
school dropout who has two or three kids already. Sixty-seven
percent are black; 27 percent are Hispanic. Like all homeless, they
qualify for Medicaid.
   Patricia Smith, four months pregnant, has an 8-year-old daughter
and 6-month-old son. Everyone in her family has asthma. She had
just spent three nights in three different hotels.
   ``I'm a walking zombie,'' said Mrs. Smith, 37, clutching a
dog-eared prayer book to her bosom. ``It's like you're falling and
there's no bottom and there's nothing to catch on to.
   ``It makes me feel like I'm a failure. People treat you like
you're nothing,'' she said. ``I'm always petrified. I've chased
rats as big as alley cats away from my children. But I have no
place else to go.''
   Frustrated social workers offer prenatal care but expectant
mothers don't actively seek it. Some skip sessions to keep their
Medicaid appointments, which can take two weeks to reschedule.
Others loathe standing in line for hours and filling out forms at
hospital clinics.
   ``We knock on doors in the hotels,'' said Barbara Conanan,
director of the homeless project at St. Vincent's Hospital, which
has a van to drive patients to clinics or gives them transit tokens
to make it easier to get care.
   ``You have to reach out. Some don't understand the need for
prenatal care. Many of them never sought it for their other
children. There's a real lack of education,'' Ms. Conanan said.
   In a pilot program, a team from Bellevue Hospital identifies and
registers pregnant women at the Prince George Hotel. The city then
pays their way to and from the hospital for checkups.
   In addition, the city's Department of Health has clinics inside
three hotels, which offer convenience but lack such amenities as
private exam rooms found in a hospital or doctor's office.
   The state Bureau of Reproductive Health also has a $100,000
medical van that dispenses prenatal care at five sites.
   Living in a hotel may sound downright cozy, especially when a
room costs taxpayers an average $2,000 a month or $23,725 a year;
that's enough to rent a spacious apartment or make a down payment
on a house. Half the bill is paid by the federal government; the
other half is split by the city and state.
   In New York, however, the money most commonly rents space in
warehouses of despair such as the Martinique, Prince George,
Holland and Allerton hotels. Expectant mothers and children are
especially vulnerable in these hostile incubators.
   Drug dealers recruit homeless children as lookouts and couriers,
according to city council's Select Committee on the Homeless. Other
kids sit in hallways at night while their mothers deal sex for
crack, hotel residents said.
   Some hotels are brothels, the committee said. By day, hookers
rent rooms by the hour. When business drops off at night, the
homeless move back in. The beds are called hot sheets because
nobody stays on them too long.
   Jacqueline Macklin, 31, a hotel resident since 1984, sent her
11-year-old twin daughters to live in Philadelphia with their
grandmother in 1987 after they saw a security guard shot dead by
another guard in the Holland Hotel.
   ``There's nothing a kid doesn't see in here,'' said Mrs.
Macklin, herself a recovering crack addict.
   ``It's a picture of the worst of our civilization,'' said Robert
Hayes, founder of the Coalition for the Homeless.
   ``It's an abandonment of the most fragile people to the most
devastating of environments, and then we wonder why these kids are
so irreparably harmed,'' Hayes said. ``It's insane as well as cruel
to leave a woman in a situation that will result in a sick baby.''

   Joseph Johnson, homeless and dispirited, sat
with his pregnant wife and 21-month-old son in a welfare office,
waiting and waiting to be told what hotel bed they would sleep in
that night.
   ``It's like being sent on a cattle truck,'' Johnson, 33, said as
he squashed a cockroach on a wall.
   ``Just being here wears you down. No human being should have to
live under these conditions. If there's a breath left in my body,
I'm going to get out of this system,'' Johnson said.
   New York City provides private rooms for homeless pregnant women
and their families, but because not all of the 55 city hotels that
shelter the homeless allow long stays, some families are bounced
from hotel to hotel like human pinballs. The numbing ritual begins
in the city's four emergency assistance units, or EAUs, where an
average of 85 families show up nightly.
   On a recent rainy Friday night in Brooklyn, Johnson plopped down
in a fiberglass chair next to his wife, Angela, six months
pregnant. Their son chewed on a pizza crust and fidgeted in a
stroller under a dingy Christmas decoration spelling out ``Season's
Greetings.''
   The Johnsons, welfare recipients who had been burned out of
their apartment, left their old hotel at 11 a.m., checked in at the
welfare office and came to the EAU at 5 p.m. At 9 o'clock, they
were assigned a hotel, but the welfare check to pay for it wasn't
processed until midnight. They waited for a van and got to sleep at
2 a.m. The tedious process began anew within hours.
   In a waiting area, mothers stripped their tots to bare bottoms
to change their clothes. Diapered infants napped on sheetless,
spotted mattresses inside metal cribs. A nurse gave pregnancy tests
in a restroom. Three security guards watched a baseball game on a
color television placed inside a vacant crib.
   Well past midnight and a normal bedtime, youngsters scampered
around an untended metal detector. The detectors, used to check for
concealed weapons, are standard at all shelters and EAUs.
   Plastic garbage bags and beer cases bound with string are
luggage the homeless drag with them every night.
   Theresa Keels, 35, four months pregnant, had stayed in three
hotels in three nights.
   From her bag, she pulled four crumpled and unfilled prescription
slips for asthma medication. She'd lost her Medicaid card and was
on the run too much to get a new one, much less go for prenatal
care.
   ``I'm worried about losing this baby and not having no place to
stay,'' said Ms. Keels, whose aunt kicked her out of her former
apartment. ``It's a physical and mental strain on me. You're never
settled. You're running from this place to that place. It's a
miserable life.''
   Among her meager possessions was a tattered blue book on legal
rights of the homeless printed by the Legal Aid Society.

   New York's effort to house homeless women who
are also pregnant is the nation's biggest, most expensive and most
criticized. It is also far ahead of other cities' attempts to care
for these doubly distressed women.
   ``No city has come up with an adequate plan to deal with the
problem. It's a real tragedy,'' said Tim Hager, assistant director
of the National Coalition for the Homeless in Washington, D.C.
   ``At least New York is doing something. They're just not doing
the right thing. They're wasting millions of dollars on fleabag
hotels instead of building adequate housing,'' Hager asserted.
   New York is under court order to provide private rooms to
pregnant women because of contagious illnesses rife in group
shelters. None of four other cities surveyed by The Associated
Press has a comparable policy.
   New York has a pregnancy test to screen expectant mothers. The
city, state and volunteers also provide specific prenatal care
clinics for expectant mothers, a public program no other city
offers, according to the homeless coalition.
   Here is a brief look at the four other cities:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Los Angeles:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   With an unknown number of pregnant women among its estimated
35,000 to 50,000 homeless, Los Angeles says care is provided
through state health insurance and social programs at shelters.
   ``There's no reason not to have quality prenatal care'' in
California, ``unless you're in the country illegally or mentally
disturbed,'' said Larry Johnson, assistant director of Los Angeles
County's Department of Community and Senior Citizens Services.
   But social workers say care is hindered by the bureaucracy and
an inadequate shelter system.
   ``As bad as things are in New York, there's probably less
available on the whole in California,'' said Gary Blasi of the
Legal Aid Society.
   Ruth Schwartz, a nurse with the Los Angeles Health Care Project,
says health centers are overloaded and public transportation is
inadequate.
   ``If you're pregnant, you're at the bottom of the homeless pile.
The system is in no way meeting the demand. Only the persistent and
the determined keep their appointments for prenatal care,'' Ms.
Schwartz said.
   She said she visits families who live among church pews or in
cars, garages divided by bed sheets or shacks made of plywood and
tarps. The women in the shacks drink and bathe from a garden hose.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Chicago:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In Chicago, a routine medical screening given to homeless people
entering the shelter system identifies women who are pregnant and
sends them to one of three shelters among the city's 45. The women
are encouraged to see their own doctors for prenatal care.
   ``Our focus is not on pregnancy. Our focus is finding them a
place to stay,'' said Judith Walker, commissioner of the Department
of Human Services. ``Prenatal care is the least of their worries.
You've got to deal with survival first.''
   The city has no count on how many of its estimated 25,000 to
30,000 homeless are pregnant.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Atlanta:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Pregnant women get priority in Atlanta's effort to place all
homeless in permanent, subsidized housing when it becomes
available, so their numbers among the 10,000 to 20,000 homeless are
no more than a few dozen, according to the Task Force for the
Homeless. Women must provide proof of pregnancy from their own
doctors.
   Prenatal care is available at one hospital, and the homeless are
given transportation tokens to get there. However, it is
time-consuming.
   ``It takes a whole day of their time to get care. You spend your
whole day waiting,'' said Anita Beaty, director of the Task Force.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Boston:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The bulk of the 15,000 to 20,000 homeless people in
Massachusetts live in Boston and 75 percent are families, but
officials don't know how many are pregnant women. State welfare
provides health care, but there are no specific prenatal clinics.
   State social workers try to contact pregnant homeless women
about public hospitals and clinics where prenatal care is
available, but they concede they don't reach everyone.
   ``You can theoretically have all kinds of services available,
but you have to deliver them to people,'' said Judith Riley,
assistant deputy commissioner for Department of Social Services.

   The United States and Japan have signed an
agreement opening Japan to more American beef and citrus.
   The agreement, reached last month during negotiations in Tokyo,
will open Japan gradually over the next few years to more U.S. beef

been in effect.
   The Commerce Department has estimated annual U.S. beef exports

<HEAD>Stocks Hit Post-Crash High; Oil Prices Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Buying related to financial futures has driven the stock market
to its highest levels since last October's market crash.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 27.03 points
Tuesday to finish at 2,158.61, its highest post-crash level since
it closed at 2,152.20 on June 22.
   A weaker dollar, higher interest rates and the U.S. Navy's
downing of an Iranian passenger jet over the weekend had convinced
many traders that the stage was set for a selloff on Wall Street.
But while the market opened moderately lower, the Dow average moved
into plus territory around midday and climbed steadily for the rest
of the session.
   The oil market also shrugged off Iran's outrage over the
incident in the Persian Gulf, saying its aftermath probably would
not affect petroleum shipping or inflate prices.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, one barometer of world oil
prices, the contract for August delivery of West Texas Intermediate
crude oil rose 15 cents per barrel, to $15.09.
   Traders ascribed the price rise to short-term speculative buying
ahead of the American Petroleum Institute's weekly report on U.S.
oil supplies, but emphasized that the oil market remained depressed
because of world oversupply and the outlook for prices was down.
   In trading of other commodities, soybean futures closed sharply
lower on the Chicago Board of Trade as a rainy forecast diluted
fears of drought damage on the crop, but corn prices advanced on
speculation that the moisture would come too late to prevent
significant damage to that crop.
   Wheat and oats followed the soybean market, which saw some
contracts plummet the 30-cents-a-bushel limit for daily trading.
   Separately, the dollar drifted lower in light trading as the
pound jumped in response to Monday's increase in British interest
rates. The dollar fell in New York trading to 134.33 Japanese yen
from 135.40 yen late Friday, while the pound rose to $1.7075 from
$1.6825.
   Bond prices declined, sending interest rates higher, as traders
returned from the three-day holiday weekend without any strong
conviction about the market's direction. The yield on the
Treasury's closely-watched 30-year bond rose to 8.87 percent from
8.83 percent late Friday.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities fell in the government's latest auction to the lowest
level since last month.
   The Treasury Department sold $6.6 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 6.57 percent on Tuesday, down from
6.59 percent last week. Another $6.6 billion was sold in six-month
bills at an average discount rate of 6.71 percent, down from 6.75
percent last week.
   The three-month rates were the lowest since June 20, when the
bills sold for 6.51 percent. The six-month rates were the lowest
since June 13, when the bills averaged 6.67 percent.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 6.77 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,833.90 and 7.04 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,660.80.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield
for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making
changes in adjustable rate mortgages, dipped to 7.52 percent last
week from 7.53 percent the previous week.

<HEAD>Irving Says Banca Commerciale Sweetened Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Irving Bank Corp. is backing a sweetened merger
offer from Banca Commerciale Italiana SpA, which rival Bank of New
York Corp. contends is still inferior to its own hostile bid.
   Irving said on Tuesday that its management had negotiated an
amendment to the outstanding offer by Banca Commerciale, Italy's
second largest bank, for 51 percent of Irving's common stock to
include a dividend in the form of stock warrants to Irving
shareholders.
   Irving said the sweetened offer made the overall transaction
worth at least $79.50 per share, which the bank holding company's
board of directors deemed superior to Bank of New York's ``best and
final bid.''
   Under a complex restructuring plan that also would include the
sale of assets and a special cash dividend, Banca Commerciale has
offered $80 cash a share for 51 percent of Irving's common stock,
or a total of about $760 million.
   The new agreement also provides for Irving to distribute a
dividend in the form of stock warrants to all Irving shareholders
before the Banca Commerciale tender offer. The warrants, one for
every four shares of Irving stock, would have a term of seven years
and an exercise price of $65 per share of Irving stock.
   The new deal means Banca Commerciale would be offering the same
amount of money for Irving shares even though the shares would be
worth less to the Italian bank because of the distribution by
Irving.
   Irving said BCI's financial adviser, Lazard Freres & Co., put
the value of the warrants to shareholders at $4 to $7 per share of
Irving common stock.
   Irving stock closed at $71.37{ per share, up 12{ cents, in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading Tuesday. Bank of New York
rose $1.25 per share to $36.12{.
   Bank of New York responded that its bid for all of Irving's
stock remained superior.
   Owen Brady, a spokesman for Bank of New York, said BNY's
financial adviser Morgan Stanley & Co. projected that if Irving
stock sold for $45 a share after a merger with BCI, the warrants
effectively would add no more than $1.35 per share in value to
BCI's previous offer.
   Bank of New York, which owns a 4.9 percent stake in Irving, is
offering $15 in cash and 1.575 shares of its own stock for each of
Irving's common shares outstanding. The offer is valued at around
$68 a share or $1.2 billion.
   Bank of New York has offered to sweeten its offer by slightly
raising the stock portion of the bid and adding other shareholder
incentives, including a special cash dividend, if Irving agreed to
abandon its anti-takeover ``poison pill.''
   The company also has gone to court seeking to remove the
defensive mechanism, which would make an unsolicited merger
prohibitively expensive.
   Irving steadfastly has rejected Bank of New York's takeover
advances, which surfaced last September.
   Estimates of the value of the offers have differed widely. The
Irving board said analyses by its advisers, Goldman, Sachs & Co.
and J.P. Morgan & Co. Inc., said the Banca Commerciale offer was
worth $74 to $79.50 a share. Robert Felise, an executive vice
president at Irving, said a separate analysis by Lazard Freres
valued the sweetened BCI offer at $80 or more per share.
   BCI's advisers valued the Bank of New York offer at $72 to $77 a
share.

<TEXT>
   A representative of a local gasoline dealers
group is criticizing as anti-competitive the merger of the area's
two largest oil companies, which will give Sun Co. Inc. an
estimated 33 percent local market share.
   Sun, the nation's 10th-largest petroleum producer, announced
Tuesday it planned to purchase Atlantic Refining and Marketing
Corp. for $513 million.
   Sun said the acquisition would help meet its needs for increased
refining flexibility.
   Sun, which markets Sunoco gasoline, operates in 27 states.
Atlantic operates in Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey.
Atlantic reportedly has 20 percent of the market share in the
Philadelphia area, while Sun has about 13 percent.
   Tom Anderson, executive director of the Pennsylvania Gasoline
Dealers Associations, said consumers should be concerned by the
acquisition.
   ``Another level of competition has been eliminated,'' he said.
``It's going to increase the price because Atlantic was the
cheapest on the street.''
   The purchase is subject to approval by the Federal Trade
Commission and the U.S. Justice Department.
   Part of the deal includes a Philadelphia refinery that has a
daily capacity of 135,000 barrels of crude oil and a 986-mile
pipeline that runs from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania
and to Rochester and Tonawanda, N.Y.
   Sun chairman Robert McClements Jr. said the company will
purchase all shares of Atlantic Petroleum Maatschappij BV, a
Netherlands holding company owned by John Duess.
   Duess bought the Atlantic properties from Atlantic Richfield Co.
of Los Angeles in 1985 for $420 million when it decided to pull out
of the region.
   ``Atlantic is a well-run and well-managed company,'' Sun
spokesman Kenneth Huffman said. He also said Atlantic would
continue using its present logo.
   Sun would pay for all Atlantic's inventory, including crude oil
and finished products and working capital.
   Huffman said a major part of the deal was the acquisition of the
Philadelphia refinery, which, unlike Sun's suburban Marcus Hook
facility, can process crude oil classified as high-sulphur and
heavy. Sun's refinery can handle only so-called lighter crude.
   ``This acquisition is consistent with our objective of
strengthening the company's position in refining and marketing,''
said McClements.
   Sun presently owns four refineries with a processing capacity of
460,000 barrels of crude oil daily, plus 6,000 Sunoco stations in
27 states in the eastern half of the U.S.
   The Atlantic refinery, whose 440 employees handled 130,000
barrels a day, would help Sun meet its daily sales demand of
700,000 barrels. In the past Sun has purchased from outside sources.
   Atlantic also has 571 company-owned stations and supples another
400 independent stations.
   Besides Marcus Hook, Sun has refineries in Toledo, Ohio; Tulsa,
Okla.; and Yabucoa, Puerto Rico.

<HEAD>Report: Chicago Could Lose Role As Major Financial Center</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Possible regulatory changes stemming from the
October stock market crash could threaten this city's position as a
major financial center, according to a new report by local
government and business.
   Chicago is ``the world capital of hedging'' through its futures
and options exchanges, but changes linked to criticism of those
markets following the crash threaten that dominance, said the
report prepared by the city's Economic Development Commission and
the Civic Committee of the Commercial Club of Chicago.
   ``In particular, regulatory action could reduce the volume and
liquidity of trading here and could cause the Chicago exchanges to
lose their international leadership to exchanges that operate with
fewer restrictions,'' stated the report, released Tuesday.
   To prevent that, the city's political and business leaders must
unite to lobby against new government regulation of Chicago's
exchanges, the report recommends.
   The city also must improve its public schools and reduce its
business taxes to expand its financial-services economy, the report
recommends.
   ``Many executives interviewed stated that Chicago's development
as a financial services center is hindered by the poor education
provided by the Chicago public schools,'' it said.
   The report called specifically for public schools to do a better
job training students in computer literacy and typing skills.
   Mayor Eugene Sawyer said his staff was studying how to institute
the report's recommendations.
   Chicago ranks third in the nation, behind New York and Los
Angeles, with 330,000 financial-services jobs and trails in such
global businesses as international banking and money management,
the report said.
   ``It is world-class in trading, but lags London, New York and
Tokyo as a broad-based financial capital,'' the report says.
   Instead of competing head-on with those cities, Chicago must
capitalize on its strength as a leader in ``global risk
management'' and work to attract new financial businesses in such
fields as insurance and banking, the report states.
   ``Internationally, Chicago is the center of risk management, the
world capital of hedging,'' the report says.
   The city has four major exchanges: the Chicago Board of Trade
and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which together have 60 percent
of the world futures markets; the Chicago Board Options Exchange,
which has nearly 60 percent of the global options market; and the
Midwest Stock Exchange, one of the world's top five exchanges for
trading equities.
   The report recommends establishing a ``risk management center
committee'' comprised of business executives and economists. The
committee would act partly as a public relations unit to promote
Chicago's image as a financial services center.
   It also would help coordinate the introduction of new financial
services products in Chicago and create an institute at a local
university to train people in risk management services.

Algeria and Ecuador.
   The unnamed sources told the news agency the three nations have
not officially contacted other members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries about the proposed meeting.
   The agency quoted its sources as saying some OPEC nations would
give a ``positive response'' to a call for an emergency session.
   But they said major member states may not accept because there
is no guarantee an emergency meeting would have a positive effect
on the cartel's policies or oil markets.
   The agency did not elaborate, but the reference to nations which
might object to an emergency meeting apparently meant Kuwait and
Saudi Arabia.
   Both OPEC states have opposed calls for emergency sessions
without first establishing clear objectives.
   The news agency said its sources hinted that Venezuela, Algeria
and Ecuador might ask OPEC Secretary General Subroto, the former
Indonesian oil minister, to canvass member states about support for
an emergency meeting.
   Last month, the OPEC nations decided to extend until the end of
1988 the production and pricing agreement reached last year.
However, several cartel members are overproducing in violation of
OPEC's overall 15.06 million barrels-a-day ceiling.
   The agency's sources acknowledged severe weakness in the world
oil market. But they cautioned that without firm policy commitments
prior to any emergency OPEC meeting, an ineffectual session could
``increase the chaos.''
   The sources noted that overproduction and the definition of
exactly what constitutes crude oil production are key issues which
would have to be addressed.

   Hewlett-Packard Co. has increased
prices on some circuit boards because of ``drastic, wholesale price
jumps'' for memory chips.
   The company on Tuesday raised prices on memory expansion boards
from 2 percent to 25 percent. There was no price increase on memory
boards for the company's new line of Precision Architecture
computers based on reduced instruction set computing, or RISC.
   Hewlett-Packard joined a growing list of companies that have
raised prices in response to the severe shortage of DRAMs, which
stands for dynamic random access memories.
   Until recently, the price of chips bought under long-term
contracts remained relatively stable, while spot market prices
escalated, said Hewlett-Packard spokesman Gene Endicott. Now,
long-term contract prices are also rising.
   Hewlett-Packard, which had revenues of $8.1 billion in 1987,
increased prices 3 to 25 percent on memory boards designed for
computers used in business, engineering and manufacturing.
   For example, the price of a memory board for the HP 3000, a
business computer, will increase 25 percent to $12,500 from $10,000.
   ``Although costs have increased, shipments to customers of
existing products have not been interrupted,'' the company said.
   ``We continue to share the concern of others in the electronics
industry about DRAM availability ... and are hopeful the problem is
corrected soon,'' the company said.
   The increase follows similar moves by Digital Equipment Corp.,
Sun Microsystems Inc., Apple Computer Inc. and other companies.

   Japanese purchased 58,474 foreign cars in the first
six months of this year, an increase of 31.5 percent over the first
half of 1987, the Japan Automobile Importers Association said
Wednesday.
   The association said the sales included 41,404 cars from West
Germany, up 21.6 percent from a year earlier; 5,028 from the United
States, up 159 percent; 4,270 from Britain, up 49.1 percent; 2,892

and 1,947 from Italy, up 4.5 percent.
   The association gave no reason for the increase in sales, but
sales of Japanese cars also have increased, reflecting steading
consumer spending and strong sales campaigns.
   The Japan Automobile Dealers Association said Tuesday sales of
Japanese cars in the first half rose 16.9 percent from a year
earlier to a record 2.5 million cars.

   The stock market hovered in a narrow range
today, pausing after Tuesday's advance to new highs for the year.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 2.14 to 2,156.47
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers held a narrow edge on losers in the overall tally of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 451 up, 442 down and 554
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 25.18 million shares as of 10

   However, brokers said, a good deal of skepticism persists about
the staying power of the market's recent rally. That seemed evident
today in the reluctance of many traders to chase after stocks at
their highest levels since the crash last fall.
   Among actively traded blue chips, International Business

   A major post-crash reform that bars program
trading during times of volatility in the stock market is expected
to be dropped by the New York Stock Exchange, a published report
said today.
   The NYSE plans to phase out by the fall its so-called
``collar,'' which bars index arbitragers from using the automated
stock order system when the Dow Jones industrial average rises or
declines at least 50 points in a day, the Wall Street Journal said,
quoting unnamed industry sources.
   Index arbitragers buy and sell large amounts of stocks and stock
index futures, profiting on price disparities between the two
related instruments.
   The New York Times and the Journal also reported today that the
Big Board was considering giving individual investors priority over
institutions under certain circumstances when both are using
program trading, a move designed to bring individual investors back
into the market.
   ``It's an express track for the individual investor,'' one NYSE
official told the Times. ``There is still a perception that the
individual investor is at a disadvantage, and we want to say that
it is not true. That's the push behind this rule.''
   Both proposals are expected to be considered by the NYSE's board
of directors at a regular monthly meeting Thursday, according to
the newspapers.
   NYSE spokeswoman Sharon Gamsin said she could not comment on
what issues the board would consider at Thursday's meeting.
   However, she noted the collar, enacted in February, had been set
to expire after six months unless the exchange decided to extend it.
   ``When the collar was put in place, it had a sunset provision in
it. It was never meant to be permanant,'' Ms. Gamsin said.
   The collar was enacted as a way of reforming the U.S. stocks and
futures markets in the wake of the Oct. 19 crash.
   Critics have complained the collar is ineffective and may even
add to the volatility it was designed to curb. For one thing, they
said, sophisticated program traders could get around the collar by
having their orders distributed on the trading floor manually by
brokers.
   Market regulators also were cool on the idea. When the
Securities and Exchange Commission approved it for a six-month
trial, it asked the exchange to consider other alternatives to
curbing market volatility.
   However, proponents say market swings of 50 points or more have
become less frequent because of the collar.

   The Pentagon has sharply increased the number
of inspectors trying to spot fraud among defense contractors, but
still more are needed and they are not likely to be added, the
Defense Department's inspector general said today.
   ``Given the (Defense) department's projected budget shortfalls
for the coming years, I am pessimistic that the investigative
organizations will get the additional resources they need,'' June
Gibbs Brown told the House Armed Services Committee.
   She did not speak specifically about details of the ongoing
criminal investigation into fraud and bribery allegations among
Pentagon contractors and consultants.
   But she said the Pentagon has about 1,000 people who do nothing
but investigate fraud, a sharp increase from 1982, when 375 were
assigned to that task.
   ``In spite of these impressive gains, I remain concerned over
the resources available to the defense criminal investigation
organizations for the detection and investigation of fraud,'' she
said.
   At least 450 more fraud investigators are needed, she said.
   Confusion surrounds Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci's hurried
announcement of contract suspensions in response to the widening
Pentagon bribery probe, with officials unable to say which projects
are covered.
   Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said Tuesday that the Defense
Department is still trying to implement Carlucci's order.
   Howard suggested Carlucci's announcement was a response to
clamoring in Congress and elsewhere for the Pentagon to do
something to restore its credibility in the midst of the criminal
investigation.
   ``We had people here and people on the (Capitol) Hill demanding
immediate action to suspend people, to suspend contracts,'' Howard
said when asked to explain the timing of Friday's announcement.
   Defense contractors say they are still waiting for formal
notification of the contract suspensions.
   ``We're in the dark,'' said Cohann Whitney, a TRW Inc.
spokeswoman.
   ``We've received no official notification and until we do, we're
going ahead with production. The work will continue,'' said Robert
Knapp, a spokesman for Litton Industries.
   TRW is taking the same position. ``We're working with the Navy
to try to get some clarification on the announcement,'' Ms. Whitney
said.
   Carlucci announced last Friday he was ordering an immediate
suspension of what Pentagon officials said were $1 billion worth of
contracts. He said he was acting because the pacts may be tainted
by the bribery allegations.
   The investigation centers on allegations that defense
contractors and consultants, many of them former defense officials,
bribed Pentagon officials for contracting details that could be
vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars.
   Asked for details of the contract suspensions, Howard said: ``We
worked that one very quickly and we gave you the best information
we had.''
   But he admitted, ``I don't know the answer'' when asked which
contracts are involved, or whether the freeze affects contractors
and subcontractors alike.
   Navy officials were trying Tuesday to figure out how to
implement Carlucci's order.
   ``We're working on it; we're still trying to figure out the
details,'' Lt. Barbara Kent, a spokeswoman for the Navy, said late
Tuesday.
   At a hastily called news conference late Friday afternoon,
Carlucci said he was acting on the basis of information in
affidavits that had been unsealed a day earlier by a federal
magistrate in Dallas. The FBI said in the affidavits that its
wiretaps had recorded a Navy procurement officer passing along
inside information to consultants about contracts.
   Pentagon officials have said one of the affected contracts is
between the Navy and Litton, to build hand-held computers for the
Marines for use in transmitting targeting information.
   But Knapp said work on the contract will go ahead until Litton
receives official word.
   The contract was awarded in 1982 and the remainder of the pact
is worth $23.5 million, according to John George, a spokesman for
Litton. The devices are produced by Litton's Colorado Springs,
Colo., plant, which employs about 100 people, he said.
   Another pact identified as being covered by the order is between
the Navy and TRW Inc., to build new operating centers for
anti-submarine warfare. It was let in October 1987 and is for $36.7
million, Ms. Whitney said.
   ``To the best of our knowledge, TRW is not one of the companies
involved in this probe and we have no idea why this action was
taken,'' she said. ``We are working with the Navy to try to get
some clarification on Carlucci's announcement.''
   Asked how long the freeze would last, Howard said, ``I can't
give you a black-and-white answer on that at this point.''
   He added, ``we're looking at it; we're looking at it very
carefully and I'm aware of this concern that you may be punishing
the innocent along with the guilty. This is no judgment of ultimate
innocence or guilt, freezing these contracts. It simply seems a
prudent step to take until we do sift through the evidence.''
   The spokesman added that ``we did not have to go to trial and
conviction in order to take this step, nor do I think it would be
essential that we would go through trial and conviction in order to
unfreeze a contract, if, as the evidence unfolds, it's clear that
they're not involved.''
   Howard indicated the Pentagon was responding to pressure,
particularly from outraged legislators, but said it waited until
the affidavits spelled out specific allegations before acting.
   ``We said we can't do that, we can't do that unless we have some
evidence. We had an affidavit come down that had some evidence,''
he said. ``We took immediate action.''
   House Armed Services Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., joined by a
number of other lawmakers, had urged Carlucci to do ``something
dramatic'' to restore credibility as increasing numbers of
contracts were called into question.

   Stock prices were broadly higher Wednesday,
boosted mainly by Wall Street's better-than-expected performance
Tuesday.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was up 13.1
points, or 0.1 percent, at 1,867.9 at midday. Volume totaled a
light 267.8 million shares.
   Shares were boosted by the positive overnight performance of the
New York and Tokyo markets, and oil stocks were among the best
performers.
   But dealers said fund managers in London steered clear of
significant involvement in equity trading amid perceptions that the
London market lacks the impetus to move sharply up or down in the
near term.
   On Tuesday, London players harbored fears that Wall Street might
drop after an Iranian commercial airliner was downed by the U.S.
Navy.

<TEXT>
   Morrison Knudsen Corp. has filed suit
against Illinois businessman Edward F. Heil, charging him with
filing a false and misleading statement with federal regulators.
   The Boise-based construction, engineering and shipbuilding
company charged in the suit filed Tuesday that Edward F. Heil did
not disclose in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission the nature of a civil suit brought against him and
others by the state of Illinois over a major Chicago convention
center project.
   Heil, the president of Environmental Construction Co. of Downers
Grove, Ill., made the SEC filing following his purchase of 6.2
percent of Morrison Knudsen's stock. Federal regulations require
anyone buying more than 5 percent of a company's stock to reveal
their reasons for the acquisition to SEC.
   Morrison Knudsen officials said the Illinois attorney general's
office charged Heil and two companies he controls with trying to
defraud the Illinois Metropolitan Fair and Exposition Authority in
connection with the McCormick Place Annex, a recently completed
expansion of the McCormick Place Exhibition Hall in Chicago.
   Ileen Lasko of the Illinois attorney general's office said Heil
was one of 14 contracting companies named in the civil suit, which
seeks $7 million in restitution and damages from the defendants.
   In the suit, Illinois Attorney General Neil F. Hartigan charged
the contractors with submitting phony bills for labor and materials
through dummy minority contractors.
   Heil said in his SEC filing his purchase of 670,300 shares of
Morrison Knudsen common stock for $28.8 million was intended as an
investment and to gain a seat on the company's board.
   Wall Street analysts have dismissed a possible takeover attempt
of Morrison Knudsen by Heil.
   The Illinois suit seeks to bar any company of which Heil is a
director from doing business with public authorities in the state.
Morrison Knudsen's suit charged Heil failed to disclose to the SEC
what effect his presence on the board would have on its recently
awarded $156 million construction contract with the Metropolitan
Sanitary District of Greater Chicago.
   Morrison Knudsen claimed Heil's involvement could also affect
its bid on a large railcar refurbishment contract with the Chicago
Transit authority and a third Illinois project under consideration.

   About 2,000 barges were backed up along the drought-shrunken
Mississippi River today, and North Carolina farmers repaid a good
deed by sending off 1,000 bales of hay to help Ohio farmers feed
their cattle.
   A new heat wave shoved temperatures above 100 in the parched
Midwest.
   ``It looks like it's going to keep baking for a while,'' John
Miller, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Minneapolis,
said Tuesday as high- temperature records for the date, some 77
years old, were broken in 13 cities and tied in eight.
   In Davidson, N.C., tractor-trailers were loaded today with hay
donated in return for Midwestern farmers' generosity during a
drought two years ago.
   ``This is a good cause, folks,'' said Jim Graham, North Carolina
commissioner of agriculture. Another shipment of hay is going to
Kentucky.
   Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad said he was considering a state drought
emergency declaration; Wisconsin and Indiana officials said falling
river levels could force factories to shut down; and the dry spell
spread to the Northeast.
   The news wasn't all bad. Heavy rain _ as much as 5 inches _ fell
in southwest Alabama; powerful thunderstorms boomed through
sections of Montana and North Dakota. Rain also fell in Louisiana,
Arkansas, Nebraska, Mississippi and Texas.
   The weather service's six- to 10-day forecast predicted
above-normal rainfall from the mid-Mississippi Valley to the
western lower Ohio Valley and for much of New York and New England.
   However, the forecast also called for below-normal rain in the
northern Plains, the upper Misssissippi Valley and the central and
eastern Gulf Coast _ and no rain from the Rio Grande Valley to
central Oklahoma.
   Temperatures Tuesday exceeded 100 degrees from southeastern
Montana to western Minnesota, and were 95 to 99 degrees from
eastern Minnesota to Ohio.
   In Minneapolis, where it was 97 degrees, electricity demand
caused scattered power outages and forced Northern States Power Co.
to buy more expensive power from utilities across the Midwest.
   Dry conditions and July Fourth fireworks encouraged fires across
the nation, including New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, but
most were under control Tuesday.
   Stop-and-go barge traffic on the lower Mississippi stopped again
while the Army Corps of Engineers dredged shallow areas in the
river, which has dropped to record low levels because of the
drought.
   About 1,200 barges were backed up near Natchez, Miss., and 800
barges were stalled near Greenville, Miss., said corps spokesman
Michael Logue.
   Dredging at Greenville was expected to end this afternoon, but
was to resume about 25 miles south, Logue said. Dredging at Natchez
will take up to five days, and the number of backed-up barges is
expected to grow.
   Up the river, towboats picking up southbound barges at Cairo,
Ill., have begun working in convoys, Coast Guard Cmdr. Michael
Donohoe said in Memphis, Tenn. A group of four towboats with 12
barges each set out Monday, and a second convoy with three to five
towboats was to leave today.
   ``If one boat has a problem, the others will help out,'' Donohoe
said.
   A wedge of salt water moving up from the Gulf of Mexico was
expected to hit New Orleans water intakes today. While not expected
to threaten public health, the salt water could harm machinery at
refineries and other plants.
   In Wisconsin, state Natural Resources Secretary Carroll D.
Besadny met with Gov. Tommy G. Thompson on the drought's threat to
paper mills and other industries along the shrinking Wisconsin and
Fox rivers.
   The rivers may soon be too weak to dilute the treated waste
companies can normally release safely into the streams, endangering
fish and other aquatic life, the department said.
   In Indiana, the drought may leave some power plants with less
cooling water and could cause environmental problems if too much
hot water is pumped back into low streams, said Robert D. Glazier
of the state utility commission.
   In Des Moines, Iowa, Branstad said a drought emergency
declaration would speed relief programs. ``We're going to see how
it goes this week,'' he said. ``It's early enough to know it's a
real disaster.''
   In Kentucky, Gov. Wallace Wilkinson had ample reason for
sympathy as he visited farmers in the western and central sections
of his state.
   ``I've lost as much money in farming as anybody,'' said
Wilkinson, whose 1,200 acres of corns and beans are in ruin.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened narrowly mixed
today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid conflicting signals about
the condition of the crops and the potential for further drought
damage.
   ``This is the first quiet opening we've had in a long, long
time,'' said Walter Spilka, a grain analyst in New York with Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   On the bullish side, forecasts for record-breaking heat and
continued dryness in the Midwest this week threatened further
damage to the soybean and corn crops, especially with corn entering
its critical pollination stage, Spilka said.
   On the other hand, recent rains in the northern Plains, the
Southeast and the Mississippi Delta region _ and forecasts for rain
in the Midwest next week _ have tempered drought fears among
traders already nervous about high prices.
   Spilka said the rain may tempt farmers in the Delta and
Southeast to plant more soybeans.
   The Agriculture Department's weekly crop-progress reports
released late Tuesday also had a calming effect, Spilka said. The
reports showed less deterioration in the corn crop last week than
some had expected, and indicated little new damage to the soybean
crop.
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent lower to 1 cent higher with
the contract for delivery in July at $3.89 a bushel; corn was
unchanged to 2 cents lower with July at $3.42{ a bushel; oats were
2 cents to 3{ cents lower with July at $3.19 a bushel; soybeans
were 4 cents lower to 2 cents higher with July at $9.55 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .02 cent to .38 cent higher with August at
65.72 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .35 cent lower
with August at 74.90 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent lower to .35
cent higher with July at 44.30 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies

<TEXT>
   Oil refinery workers are ending a
five-month strike at the British Petroleum Co. refinery here after
ratifying a two-year contract.
   About 70 percent of the refinery workers who voted approved a
package that includes cuts in sick pay and the termination of two
employees for alleged picket line violations. About 95 percent of
the 345 employees voted. The votes were counted Tuesday night.
   The union workers, on strike since Feb. 3, are scheduled to
return to work Monday.
   ``The people are very upset over the contract, but they have
bills to pay,'' said Denis Stephano, secretary of Local 8-234 of
the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers.
   BP spokeswoman Anne Straitiff said, ``We're glad it's over,''
but declined to comment further.
   The refinery's union employees went on strike over issues
including sick leave, wages and medical benefits. Knots of strikers
have picketed the gates of the sprawling plant southwest of
Philadelphia ever since.
   Under the new contract, employees will get an increase of 30
cents an hour during the first year, followed by a 3 percent
increase the second year. The refinery's employees now average
$15.23 an hour, except those in packaging, who make between $6 and
$9 per hour.

   Government officials announced today an
agreement between Eastern Air Lines' unions and management,
designed to ease labor tensions and enhance safety at the carrier.
   Under the pact, a series of committees will be set up to hear
grievances and to handle disputes over safety procedures.
   ``Today we propose a process within which parties can begin to
address safety,'' former Labor Secretary William E. Brock, who was
appointed last month to referee Eastern's ongoing labor troubles,
told a news conference. ``It recognizes that the public safety must
not suffer at the hands of a collective bargaining dispute.''
   Transportation Secretary James H. Burnley IV called the pact a
``good beginning,'' but cautioned that the airline's workers and
executives would have to work hard to make it effective.
   ``All of the parties have agreed to a series of actions that
have the potential to reduce substantially the threat to safety
from labor-management discord,'' Burnley said. ``If the agreement
is implemented in good faith, that potential will be fully
realized.''
   Among the issues that labor-management committees to be
established will handle are the plane captain's authority, aircraft
maintenance training and workers' access to maintenance information
kept by the company.
   The agreement was signed Tuesday evening by Frank Lorenzo,
chairman of Eastern, and other airline and labor leaders, after
four hours of bargaining that was overseen by Brock.
   Tuesday's session ended with Brock saying more work was needed.
   ``A good deal of progress has been made, but no final agreement
was reached because certain participants required further
consultations with their senior officials,'' he said.
   Brock was named to try to bring the two sides together on June
2, the day Transportation Department and Federal Aviation
Administration officials released their report on Eastern's labor
turmoil.
   The report, written after government investigators studied
Eastern, Texas Air and Continental Airlines _ another Texas Air
subsidiary _ concluded that Eastern's labor troubles had to be
solved before they became a threat to safety.
   The bitter labor-management relations were sparked by the
efforts of Texas Air Corp., Eastern's parent compenay, to exact
wage concessions from Eastern's unions and to sell off many of the
airline's most profitable parts.
   Management argued that the sales were meant to raise cash for
the money-losing Eastern, while unions said the real goal was to
weaken the labor organizations.
   Texas Air announced last Friday that it had abandoned efforts to
sell Eastern's Washington-New York-Boston shuttle service to
another subsidiary.
   Also attending Tuesday's meeting were Eastern President Phil
Bakes; Mary Jane Barry, president of Local 553 of the Transport
Workers Union of America, representing flight attendants; Charles
Bryan, president of Lodge 100 of the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers, representing mechanics; and Jack
Bavis, leader of the Eastern unit of the Air Line Pilots
Association.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Marjory Williams has seen her life take several
dramatic shifts.
   Moving to Hong Kong from Boston was one. And when she began to
teach American literature, she thought that was a pretty big move _
away from English literature.
   ``Little did I know the shifts to come,'' she now says.
   Ms. Williams, 44, is the founder and sole owner of a chain of 17
career women's clothing stores that enjoyed just under $5 million
in sales in 1987.
   Seven of the stores, called She, are in Minneapolis, where Ms.
Williams' company is based. The rest, under the name Laura Caspari
_ her great-grandmother's name _ are in San Francisco; Washington,
D.C.; St. Louis; Chicago and Detroit.
   This wasn't the work Ms. Williams expected to do when she
graduated from Wellesley College in the mid-1960s.
   When the Chicago native left Wellesley, women had few job
options, and business wasn't one of them, Ms. Williams recalled in
a recent interview.
   ``One didn't talk about a career path,'' she said. ``Either you
were getting married right away ... or you went to Katie
(Katherine) Gibbs in Boston and you got your secretarial training
... or you taught or you went to graduate school.''
   ``I just had a little bit more sense of adventure,'' Ms.
Williams said. So she chose the third option _ but in Hong Kong.
   She spent 2{ years teaching English literature at Chinese
University, and then moved to India, where she switched topics and
taught American literature at the University of Bombay for three
years.
   Ms. Williams married while in India and had a son. But in 1972,
when her child was 8 months old, she decided to get a divorce and
return to the United States _ with no job and the responsibility of
single parenthood weighing heavily on her.
   ``I was starting at zero,'' she said. ``I had to think, `what am
I going to do.'''
   Her natural inclination was to pursue a doctorate in literature,
but the expenses of four years of study made that idea impractical.
   College placement officials and relatives advised Ms. Williams
to stick to traditional women's roles, such as librarian or
secretary. She knew those jobs did not suit her personality.
   But the seeds of an idea planted in Bombay had begun to take
root, and Ms. Williams found herself turning toward business.
   ``While I had been in India, I was struck by the adventure that
I felt in the business community,'' she said.
   With India having won its independence only in 1947, ``business
people were self-made men or their fathers were,'' she said. ``You
had this very entrepreneurial spirit.''
   Ms. Williams believes that spirit inspired her.
   ``I decided business was probably a good idea,'' she said. ``I
felt it would be interesting and at the same time it would meet the
practical needs I would have.''
   The road to becoming a businesswoman was a bumpy one. When she
inquired about a degree from Harvard Business School, she was
turned away for lack of practical experience.
   So she got a job as an assistant at Boston Financial Technology
Group. In 18 months, Ms. Williams worked her way up to manager of a
real estate portfolio and vice president and was now ready for
Harvard.
   After business school, she became an assistant buyer with Dayton
Hudson Corp., the Minneapolis-based retailer, where, in 1978, she
thought of selling women's career clothes in a specialty store
format.
   She suggested the concept to her bosses, but ``the idea was
deemed too risky and too unlikely at the time.''
   ``So, I went out the next year and I did do it myself,'' Ms.
Williams said.
   With a Small Business Administration-backed loan, Ms. Williams
opened four stores in her first 12 months as an entrepreneur. The
company took in $400,000 that first year, and has grown steadily.
   Ms. Williams, honored for her achievements by the state of
Minnesota and the National Association of Women Business Owners,
exudes enthusiasm about her company and retailing. As she talks
about her work, her speech quickens and she waves her hands for
emphasis.
   She oversees a staff of 140 employees, to whom she ``delegates
strongly.'' But she does the fashion buying, which has given her a
few headaches over the years.
   One occurred over the past year, when fashion gurus proclaimed
the miniskirt was back. Ms. Williams found her customers, like many
other working women, balking at the idea.
   ``The feedback I was hearing in our stores didn't support the
idea that they were going to be comfortable'' wearing shorter
skirts, she said.
   In a poll of customers, only 2 percent said they preferred
skirts above the knee, and 72 percent, asked if they would buy
shorter skirts for work, said no.
   Ms. Williams decided to buy just a few short skirts, while other
retailers flooded their stores with them. The shorter lengths
barely budged at She and Laura Caspari branches, ending up on
``sale'' racks.
   But Ms. Williams found she wasn't immune from the fallout from
the miniskirt controversy. Overall sales did temporarily dip
because customers weren't sure what to do.
   Customers ``would come in and they'd like the longer lengths,''
she said, ``but they'd say, `I don't want to invest in a length if
it's going to go out of style.'''
   This wasn't the first time Ms. Williams had to gamble on fashion
trends. In 1982, she said, the fashion market declared women no
longer wanted to wear classic clothing _ exactly what she was
selling.
   But Ms. Williams theorized the problem was too many retailers
offering career clothes. She found customers weren't ready to
abandon the conservative look.
   ``I bought against the market's advice,'' she said, ``and we did
have a terrifically successful year.''
   Another success was the development of the company's own private
label fashions.
   ``Women were finding there were dozens upon dozens of the
identicl thing _ blazers and skirts _ on rack after rack in store
after store,'' she said. ``What we started to hear from our
customers was, `I want something a little more exclusive.'''
   Her constant efforts at staying in touch with customers is part
of Ms. Williams' emphasis on customer service, which she calls
critical.
   ``The customer should feel as though she owns the store,'' she
said.
   Ms. Williams' style mirrors one she said retailers used to have.
   ``Your old-time retailers were really out there, listening to
what their customers said ... and responding immediately,'' she
said.
   Retailers must have the ability to change quickly, she said.
   ``It's good to have goals and it's good to have priorities, but
it's critical to plan flexibly,'' she said.

<HEAD>Presidential Embarrassment Highlights Controversial Computer Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STAN LEHMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When members of President Jose Sarney's
entourage carried Japanese-made personal computers on a recent trip
to the United Nations, journalists wondered whether the Brazilian
officials were flouting their own trade laws.
   The incident highlighted a controversial computer industry
protection law that keeps large chunks of Brazil's growing computer
market off-limits to foreign-owned multinationals.
   On June 8, one day after he addressed the United Nations, Sarney
was asked at a news conference to comment on the computers. His
answer was a terse, ``All I will say is that now I will take
another question.'' Later, an official denial of any wrongdoing was
issued.
   For more than a decade, local companies have been protected by
the so-called ``market reserve'' policy that gives them the
exclusive right to manufacture and sell microcomputers and
minicomputers in the country.
   Multinationals such as Unisys Corp. and International Business
Machines Corp. are allowed only to produce and market the more
powerful mainframe computers.
   Almost four years ago, this practice was formalized with passage
of Brazil's controversial Informatics Law.
   It has frustrated computer companies from the United States and
other countries wanting a greater share of what local press reports
say is the world's sixth-largest computer market after the United
States, Japan, West Germany, Britain and France.
   The law's advocates say that without market reserve, local firms
would never survive the competition from multinationals and Brazil
would never achieve technological autonomy.
   According to the Special Secretariat of Informatics, the
government agency that sets the rules for the computer industry,
the number of local companies in the sector went from nine to 350
in little more than 10 years. The number of multinationals rose
from two to just 30.
   More than half of Brazil's $3.26 billion computer market last
year was kept off-limits to foreign firms.
   Market-reserve opponents concede the policy was instrumental in
developing a thriving domestic computer industry. But they say it
has outlived its usefulness and now prevents Brazil from obtaining
up-to-date technology.
   Market reserve, they say, is responsible for Brazil's producing
more expensive and obsolete clones of foreign computers. The policy
has spawned a growing black market, which press reports estimate at
some $300 million worth of computers and components a year.
   Geraldo Moura, press spokesman of the Finance Ministry, said
there were no official figures on the volume or value of computers
smuggled into the country. But he said computer smuggling was
widespread and ``a very easy thing to get away with.''
   One of the law's major opponents is the United States, which
claims its industry has suffered some $2 billion in lost sales
because of what it considers an unfair Brazilian trade practice.
   Last year, the United States was on the verge of imposing trade
sanctions against Brazil because of what it considered an unfair
interpretation of the so-called ``equivalency principle'' used to
determine what foreign software programs could enter the country.
   Under this principle foreign software could be imported as long
as no locally made equivalent was available.
   After lengthy negotiations, the sanctions were suspended in June
1987, when the United States received assurances the software issue
would receive fairer treatment.
   But a few months later, the Informatics Secretariat banned the
entry of the MS-DOS software program produced by Microsoft Corp. In
retaliation, President Reagan announced on Nov. 13 his intention to
raise tariffs of Brazilian exports to the United States.
   Brazil soon started backtracking and in January decided to allow
Microsoft to market its MS-DOS 3.3, the most sophisticated version
of the operating system software for personal computers.
   Two months later, the Informatics Secretariat refused to license
a locally made computer that Apple Computer Inc. charged was a copy
of its Macintosh model.
   And in May, Sarney signed a law that makes it easier for
foreign-made software programs to enter the country and offers
copyright protection for the authors of software programs.
   The Informatics Secretariat believes it has taken sufficient
steps to avoid trade retaliation by the United States and does not
expect sanctions to be imposed, said Murilo Ramos, a spokesman.
   One Western diplomat, who requested anonymity, agreed, saying
the trade sanctions ``will probably once again be suspended because
at least for the moment there is no reason for retaliations.''
   But while Brazil seems to be inching towards a more flexible
stance on its market reserve policy, it has no intention of
abandoning it, at least not in the foreseeable future.
   Jose Ezil Veiga da Rocha, head of the Informatics Secretariat,
said Brazilian companies will continue receiving government
protection ``until they can stand on their own two feet and compete
on the international market.'' He did not want to predict how long
this would take.

   Bowling is making a comeback of sorts _
with yuppies and an Olympic exhibition _ thanks in part to a
company that has called this Lake Michigan city home for the past
82 years.
   Having helped rejuvenate the sport with remodeled centers,
automatic scoring screens and livelier pins, Brunswick Bowling and
Billiards Corp. is among those basking in the glow of a bowling
renaissance.
   ``Bowling is finally getting the recognition it deserves as a
competitive sport _ and it's about time,'' said Thomas R. Weigt,
president and general manager of the division.
   The only thing missing at the Brunswick plant here is the crack
of the ball crashing against the pins. And maybe the beer.
   Almost everything else one would expect to see at a bowling
alley can be found at the 1 million-square-foot plant. Bowling
balls, pins, lanes and electronic scorekeepers are manufactured and
distributed worldwide from the Muskegon operation, which is a
division of the $2 billion Skokie, Ill.,-based Brunswick Corp.
   Though Brunswick is practically synonymous with bowling, the
bowling division, with 550 employees, represents less than 10
percent of the parent corporation's business. The major business
over the last several years has come from its pleasure boating
operations and marine engine businesses.
   Still, the 143-year-old company remains a leader in the bowling
equipment industry along with rival AMF Bowling Cos. Inc.
   As a major promoter of the sport, Brunswick plans to be a
principal sponsor this summer when bowling is rolled out as an
exhibition sport in the Olympics.
   In addition to lobbying for Olympic status, Brunswick has been
at the forefront of product development. The company's urethane
ball, the Rhino, was introduced two years ago and has been highly
successful. A new line of brightly colored balls for children was
introduced in January. Brunswick calls them the Odd Balls.
   Altogether, the company makes six series of balls in dozens of
weights and colors. They include the traditional rubber ball, which
can retail for as little as $25, the middle-of-the line polyester
ball and the top-of-the-line Rhino, which can retail up to $130.
   The company has introduced a more durable, nylon-injected pin,
the Brunswick Flyer, which increases pin action and can boost
scores. The company is providing pins for the Olympics.
   Brunswick's bowling lanes now are synthetic, which make them
easier to care for than wood lanes and provide a more consistent
rolling surface. The approximately 70-foot lanes are shipped in
20-foot segments.
   Brunswick Recreation Centers division in Skokie, the biggest
operator of bowling centers in the country, has opened 12 new,
flashy centers since 1983 in the Sun Belt. One of them has a
state-of-the-art fitness center attached.
   ``We call them bowling `centers' now,'' Weigt said. ``We're
trying to change bowling's image. Bowling's always been tied to
Ralph Kramden and Archie Bunker ... and we're trying to show that
it's not at all a low-class kind of sport.''
   Part of the modernization effort centers around Brunswick's
AS-80 Colorvision automatic scorer, which is manufactured in
Muskegon.
   ``It's taken all the work out of bowling,'' Weigt said of the
product introduced in 1983 and now in nearly 20 percent of the
approximately 8,000 bowling centers in the country.
   The automatic scorers also can double as video screens, and
proprietors can use them to show videotapes, or even live
television. At Garden Bowl in Detroit, the oldest center in
Michigan, the screens are used for music videos on certain nights
to draw teen-agers for ``Rock 'n' Bowl.
   ``We've got neon lighting, too,'' manager David Zainea said.
   Such promotions are relatively new for the bowling industry, but
they are long overdue, said Bryan Collins, vice president of
marketing at Brunswick's bowling division.
   ``We're seeing remodeled centers with such things as no-smoking
sections,'' Collins said. ``These things are finally being
addressed. Surveys are finally being done to find out who's
bowling.''
   Demographic surveys of the nation's 22 million casual bowlers
and 8 million league bowlers are the job of the National Bowling
Council, the industry's advertising arm.
   ``Our profiles show that today's average bowler is younger, more
affluent, better educated and more family oriented than the
national average,'' said Robbie Puno, marketing services manager
for the council.
   More and more professionals _ doctors, lawyers and accountants
among them _ are joining leagues, said Jerry Rangel, director of
marketing services for Bowling Proprietors of America.
   ``Owners are spending a lot of money on remodeling to attract
the so-called yuppie market,'' he said. ``We've gone from hard
plastic chairs and Formica to carpeting and earth tones. It's to
make it look more like a country club than a bowling alley.''
   One of the reasons professional people are drawn to the game is
its ability to relieve stress, Collins said.
   ``There's nothing like taking a heavy ball and throwing it at
something to get rid of stress,'' he said.

   Late at night, after most people have turned off the lights and
gone to bed, the party is just beginning on telephone lines across
the country where the lonely make friends and the wimp becomes
macho.
   ``Hi, this is Baby Boy looking for Baby Girl,'' said one
late-night caller on a party line serving Washington, D.C., and the
nearby Maryland suburbs.
   Baby Girl apparently wasn't at that party, but it was hard to
tell with the chaotic jumble of voices and occasional bursts of
obscenities and sexual directions on the line.
   ``I want you, New York,'' another male caller said during a
moment of calm.
   ``I want you, too,'' a woman answered.
   Party lines like this one can take the loneliness out of living
for many, at least those willing to pay as much as $2 per minute of
anonymous conversation.
   Among an estimated 400 talk services nationwide are dating lines
for adult singles and gays, lines for teen-agers, lines for
discussions about politics and sports, even lines where callers can
exchange trivia or pick up a joke to tell the next day at the
office.
   ``I just like making new friends,'' said John, explaining why he
has become a regular on one of the 20 or so party lines available
to District of Columbia callers.
   Like many others, John calls nearly every night ``to see what's
happening,'' and occasionally to find a date.
   ``It's a very popular service,'' said Betsy Superfon, vice
president of Seattle-based Omnicall, one of the largest party line
operators in the country. ``People are lonely and want to reach out
and talk to people ... It's somebody to talk to who isn't charging
you to sit on his couch.''
   It can also be a fantasy land of illusion.
   ``You can be anything you want on the telephone,'' she said.
``Sometimes it seems every girl is blonde with blue eyes and is
going to be a doctor, and every man has dark hair, green eyes and
drives a Porsche.''
   About half the callers dial in just to listen and most of the
others call just to talk anonymously, Superfon said, but officials
at other lines estimate that as many as 60 percent of callers want
to meet their newfound friends in person.
   ``We have people finding jobs, we've had a couple of marriages
... and countless close friends,'' said Jim Day, marketing director
for Baltimore-based Jaali Inc. ``For people who are lonely or new
in town, it's a unique way to meet. It's an opportunity for minds
to meet before finding out the belt size.''
   The idea for gab lines started in Brazil when local businessman
Luiz Carlos Bravo noticed that when phone lines for his recorded
``dial-a-joke'' service got crossed, inadvertently turning the
service into a party line, the volume of calls went up.
   ``People enjoyed talking to each other,'' he said. ``They didn't
care about the jokes.''
   The idea spread to England and then the United States.
   Party lines now operate in 24 states and the District of
Columbia. Though no chat lines operate in New Jersey and Delaware,
callers in those states can reach lines in Pennsylvania and New
York.
   These lines produced an estimated $90 million for phone
companies and vendors last year, according to the Information
Industry Bulletin, an industry newsletter.
   Not everyone is high on these gab lines, though. State public
utility commissions and telephone companies say by far the most
complaints come from parents whose children have run up huge bills
on the lines. Phone companies usually forgive the charges for
first-time complainers, and most offer blocking to prevent use of a
phone for such calls. Also, some states limit the price party lines
can charge, keeping rates as low as 10 cents a minute in some areas.
   ``Kids get on these lines and talk for hours,'' said Philip
Diehl, director of telephone regulation for the Texas Public
Utility Commission.
   Texas and Southwestern Bell had tried to prohibit live
conversation on ``dial-it'' lines. But companies challenged the ban
as an infringement of their free speech rights and prevented the
phone company from cutting them off.
   In California, Pacific Bell also is locked in a battle to pull
the plug on party lines.
   ``We think that if chat lines are to exist, they need to have
some special safeguards to ensure that consumers are protected,''
said Pacific Bell spokeswoman Sandy Hale.
   Pacific Bell tried to run a talk line a few years ago, ``but
there were too many problems,'' Hale said. Despite monitors on the
lines the talk often turned sexually explicit and callers violated
the rule on anonymity by giving out names, addresses and phone
numbers.
   Many talk-line companies say they have monitors on their lines
to make sure the conversations remain anonymous, but that rule is
often broken. On most services, callers can request to be moved to
a private line where such information can be exchanged without
announcing it to others on the party line.
   The monitors are also supposed to keep conversations clean and
cut off abusive callers, but Claudia Dulude, president of the IXL
Group, a Denver-based market research firm in the dial-it industry,
believes that even with monitors it's virtually impossible to rid
chat lines of sexual talk.
   ``I tried running a clean talk line (as part of her research)
and I couldn't do it. I'm a professor at the University of
Colorado, a Harvard Business School graduate and a mother of two. I
tried to do it but I couldn't,'' she said.
   The AIDS scare has made gay dating lines among the most
successful talk lines, with high volume and fewer bad debt problems
than other lines, she said.
   Many big cities are becoming saturated with talk lines. New York
Telephone has about 20 lines in the New York metropolitan area,
applications pending for twice that many and ``more are coming in
every day,'' said spokesman Steven Marcus.
   But some are leaving, too. Phone Medium Inc. of Mill Valley,
Calif., which has whittled down its inventory of party lines to
two, has made ``a business decision'' to phase out the live
services, said spokesman Bob Stevenson.
   ``They are somewhat more prone to abuse by the customer'' than
recorded programs. ``We've had some difficulty ... with
conversations on the line and people unwilling to pay for them.''
   For companies, Dulude said, entry to the market is easy and
relatively inexpensive _ about $5,000 will buy the necessary
equipment and a phone line.
   But easy entry and saturated markets combined with complaints
and bad debt mean a short lifespan for companies in the industry,
she believes.
   ``I think they're absolutely a fad,'' she said. ``Politically
they'll go out of favor. As their revenue decreases, the phone
companies will say it's not worth it to them.''

   Stock prices finished higher Wednesday after a
late afternoon surge in reaction to Wall Street's early rise.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 15.2
points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,870.0.
   The closing level was fractionally below the day's high of
1,870.2.
   Volume was 500.2 million shares, up from Tuesday's 383.2 million.
   Traders said the index moved in positive territory throughout
the morning, fell back to its lowest point of 1,863.2 by early
afternoon, and resumed its upward drive late in the session.
   By the close of London's business day, the Dow Jones Industrial
Average was up 4.98 points at 2,163.58. Traders said they were
heartened by Wall Street's ability to overcome some opening
weakness.
   ``We had a lull after lunch as Wall Street was wobbling
around,'' said one London equity salesman, adding that ``as soon as
New York gained its footing, London was keen to go higher.''

<HEAD>Pan Am, Northwest Also Battling With Unions</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Eastern Airlines Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   While Eastern Airlines has a long history of stormy relations
with its unions, other major U.S. airlines also have been dogged by
labor troubles.
   Financially ailing Pan Am Corp. has been trying for months to
wrest pay cuts and other concessions from three of its unions. The
nation's eighth largest airline stepped up the pressure on the
holdout unions last month by threatening to sell most of its assets
if the concessions are not made.
   The Pan Am unions representing pilots and flight engineers have
agreed to cuts totaling about $240 million over three years, but
the flight attendants, Teamsters and transport workers have refused
to go along.
   To ensure its financial recovery, Pan Am needs labor concessions
totaling around $540 million over three years, analysts and company
sources estimate. The carrier posted a net loss of $83.3 million in
the first quarter.
   Northwest Airlines, the fourth largest U.S. carrier, narrowly
averted a strike by its 6,700 flight attendants in late March when
it reached a tentative contract agreement with them. The St. Paul,
Minn.-based airline said its net loss of $43.5 million in the first
quarter was partly due to the strike threat.
   Wage scales, pensions and work rules were among the major issues
in the dispute. Former Republic Airlines flight attendants had been
working under their old contract since Northwest acquired Republic
in 1986, and many former Republic employees were paid less than
their Northwest counterparts.

   Government officials announced today an
agreement between Eastern Air Lines' unions and management,
designed to ease labor tensions and enhance safety at the carrier.
   Under the pact, a series of committees will be set up to hear
grievances and to handle disputes over safety procedures.
   ``Today we propose a process within which parties can begin to
address safety,'' former Labor Secretary William E. Brock, who was
appointed last month to referee Eastern's ongoing labor troubles,
told a news conference. ``It recognizes that the public safety must
not suffer at the hands of a collective bargaining dispute.''
   Transportation Secretary James H. Burnley IV called the pact a
``good beginning,'' but cautioned that the airline's workers and
executives would have to work hard to make it effective.
   ``All of the parties have agreed to a series of actions that
have the potential to reduce substantially the threat to safety
from labor-management discord,'' Burnley said. ``If the agreement
is implemented in good faith, that potential will be fully
realized.''
   Among the issues that labor-management committees to be
established will handle are the plane captain's authority, aircraft
maintenance training and workers' access to maintenance information
kept by the company.
   The agreement was signed Tuesday evening by Frank Lorenzo,
chairman of Eastern, and other airline and labor leaders, after
four hours of bargaining that was overseen by Brock.
   Charles Bryan, president of Lodge 100 of the International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, told reporters in
Miami that he was ``optimistic and hopeful'' that the agreement
would ease labor tensions, but said he believed relations with
management would not improve overnight.
   ``We don't think this is going to be a total cure for all the
problems of Eastern,'' said Bryan, whose union represents mechanics
and baggage handlers.
   Tuesday's session ended with Brock saying more work was needed.
   ``A good deal of progress has been made, but no final agreement
was reached because certain participants required further
consultations with their senior officials,'' he said.
   Brock was named to try to bring the two sides together on June
2, the day Transportation Department and Federal Aviation
Administration officials released their report on Eastern's labor
turmoil.
   The report, written after government investigators studied
Eastern, Texas Air and Continental Airlines _ another Texas Air
subsidiary _ concluded that Eastern's labor troubles had to be
solved before they became a threat to safety.
   The bitter labor-management relations were sparked by the
efforts of Texas Air Corp., Eastern's parent compenay, to exact
wage concessions from Eastern's unions and to sell off many of the
airline's most profitable parts.
   Management argued that the sales were meant to raise cash for
the money-losing Eastern, while unions said the real goal was to
weaken the labor organizations.
   Texas Air announced last Friday that it had abandoned efforts to
sell Eastern's Washington-New York-Boston shuttle service to
another subsidiary.
   Also attending Tuesday's meeting were Eastern President Phil
Bakes; Mary Jane Barry, president of Local 553 of the Transport
Workers Union of America, representing flight attendants; Charles
Bryan, president of Lodge 100 of the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers, representing mechanics; and Jack
Bavis, leader of the Eastern unit of the Air Line Pilots
Association.

   The stock market declined slightly today,
pausing after Tuesday's advance to new highs for the year.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 27.03 points on
Tuesday, slipped back 1.25 to 2,157.36 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers held a narrow edge on gainers in the overall tally of New

   However, brokers said, a good deal of skepticism persists about

   American Airlines has agreed to lend recently
acquired rival Braniff Inc. as much as $21 million, documents filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission show.
   American already has loaned Braniff $14.4 million, according to
documents filed Tuesday by BIA-COR Holdings Inc., the investment
group which recently acquired Dallas-based Braniff for $100 million.
   American, which competes with Braniff at Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport, also agreed to purchase $19 million to $23
million of Braniff's assets, the documents said. American has
already paid Braniff $5 million for landing slots at O'Hare
International Airport in Chicago and New York's LaGuardia Airport,
the documents said.
   Sources at American previously said they planned to buy $40
million of Braniff's assets from BIA-COR Holdings, including
terminal gates and landing slots at overcrowded airports.
   ``(The investor group) came to us with the proposition to buy
some (of Braniff's) assets,'' American spokesman Lowell C. Duncan
told The Dallas Morning News Tuesday. ``We agreed to buy the assets
and as part of the agreement, we agreed to lend them the money,''
he said.
   Fort Worth-based American has loaned Braniff $6 million in a 15
percent promissory note and $8.4 million at 15 percent interest
that is secured by unspecified Braniff assets in Ft. Lauderdale,
Fla., the documents said.
   Duncan said the purchase of assets and loans of a rival carrier
didn't pose antitrust problems.
   BIA-COR Holdings completed a deal June 25 to purchase Braniff
from Dallas-based Dalfort Corp.

   Fears of higher interest rates and rising
inflation weakened consumer buying plans in June as confidence in
the American economy slipped from an 18-year high in May, a report
said Wednesday.
   The national survey by the Conference Board, a business-financed
research group, found that fewer consumers expect economic
conditions to improve in the immediate future.
   Only home-buying plans increased in June, according to the
monthly survey conducted for the board by National Family Opinion
Inc. of Toledo, Ohio.
   ``Fears about inflation and interest rates may well have
contributed to the current dip in confidence,'' Fabian Linden,
executive director of the board's Consumer Research Center, said in
a news release.
   Nevertheless, June's confidence index of 115.5, down from 120.2
in May, was 12 points higher than its year-ago level, Linden said.

Industry</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader asserted
Wednesday that Lloyd's of London has an ``unregulated, secretive''
role in the U.S. insurance industry and was a major force behind
the nationwide liability crisis.
   He said the giant insurance underwriting exchange, looking for
ways to make up losses sustained during highly publicized internal
scandals, helped spawn higher rates in the United States and
reduced compensation for victims in liability cases.
   Nader added his voice to recent charges by a number of states
that the insurance industry touched off the crisis by conspiring to
stop providing some kinds of liability coverage.
   He released a report titled ``Goliath: Lloyd's of London in the
United States,'' which charged that Lloyd's ``was a driving force
behind the commercial insurance crisis of the mid-1980s.''
   Lloyd's wields its influence in the United States primarily as a
reinsurer, providing insurance for U.S. companies in exchange for
sharing the risk of their own policies. As such, it ``dictates to a
remarkable degree both the rate and policy decisions in the U.S.
property-casualty insurance industry,'' Nader contended at a news
conference.
   ``It is a foreign, unregulated, secretive powerful lever on who
gets insurance, when and at what price in the United States,
whether it is the ability of a day care center, a trucking firm, a
school, a hospital, a mass transit system or a farmer to get
affordable insurance,'' Nader said.
   Lloyd's of London spokesman David Larner said: ``We have not
seen the report and we are not going to comment until we have had a
chance to study it.''
   The 300-year-old Lloyd's has in the last decade faced a series
of insurance scandals and suffered heavy losses insuring ships and
cargos in the Persian Gulf.
   As a result, Nader asserted, Lloyds in the mid-1980s ``saw an
opportunity in the United States and, by generating a fictional
impression that there is a litigation explosion and a lawsuit
crisis in the United States'' worked with U.S. companies for
legislation reducing victims' rights in liability cases and
restrictions on coverage for various policies.
   That resulted in increased rates for what coverage could be had
and the ensuing crisis, he said.
   This year, 18 states have filed lawsuits accusing 32 insurance
companies and underwriting agencies of engaging in secret
agreements to eliminate pollution insurance and general liability
for damage discovered after expiration of a policy.
   The suits also claim that the companies got major reinsurers,
including Lloyd's, to threaten to boycott any U.S. insurance
company that provided broader coverage.
   The report called for greater U.S. regulation of reinsurers, and
alternative reinsurance programs to be set up by federal and state
governments.

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Procter & Gamble Co. said Wednesday it is
entering a joint venture to make and sell personal care products in
China, the world's most populous country.
   The consumer products giant said it has entered a joint venture
with three China-based organizations to produce and sell products
including dishwashing detergents, shampoo, bath foam and other
personal-care goods.
   Edwin L. Artzt, president of P&G International and vice chairman
of the company's board of directors, signed the agreement Wednesday
for Procter & Gamble, the company announced. He said it represents
a long-term commitment to doing business in China.
   P&G officials said the joint venture will greatly expand
distribution of the company's products in China. Procter & Gamble
is to provide technical and management expertise to the venture.
   P&G officials declined to say how much of a profit they expect
the joint venture will produce for the company.
   Until now, Procter & Gamble products sold in China have been
imported into the country in small quantities, through so-called
``friendship stores'' established to serve foreign visitors.
   P&G said it and a Hong Kong-based company, Hutchison Whampoa
Ltd., reached agreement with Guangzhou Soap Factory and the
Guangzhou Economic and Technological Development District's import
and export corporation to form the joint venture company in
Guangzhou, a large city in southern China.
   The new company will be called Procter & Gamble (Guangzhou) Ltd.
It will begin making products in China by October, officials said.
   The initial product lineup will include Guangzhou's factory
brands of shampoo, bath foam and dishwashing detergents, along with
some well-known P&G products. Most of these products will be sold
in China, but some will be exported, officials said in making the
announcement in Cincinnati and Guangzhou.
   P&G's international trade is the fastest-growing segment of its
business. International sales accounted for about one-third of
P&G's $17 billion in total worldwide sales last year.
   ``Procter & Gamble is committed to providing products of
superior quality and value that best fill the needs of the world's
consumers. We look forward to playing an important role in meeting
the growing demand for these types of products in China, and in
sharing our business experience and advanced technology with our
new partners,'' Artzt said.
   The agreement resulted from three years of negotiations, Procter
& Gamble spokesman Don Tassone said. P&G prepared for the venture
by advertising its products on Chinese television for 18 months,
from 1985 through early 1987.
   ``That was an effort to introduce our company and some of our
leading brands to the people of the country,'' Tassone said.

<HEAD>West German Government Agrees to Higher Subsidies for Airbus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German government officials have
agreed to more than double subsidies to the Airbus program, a
spokesman said.
   Dietrich Vogel, an Economics Ministry spokesman, said Wednesday
that the government plans to more than double its allocation to the
aircraft program in 1989 to 524 million marks, or around $291
million at current exchange rates.
   The Airbus jetliners are manufactured by Airbus Industrie, a
European aircraft consortium financed by the governments of West
Germany, France, Britain and Spain.
   The subsidy, originally planned at 200 million marks, will cover
the payments guaranteed by the West German government and made by
the state-controlled Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GmbH, which holds
the West German share of the Airbus program.
   Vogel said the agreement to increase the Airbus subsidy was
reached at a meeting Tuesday between Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg, Economics Minister Martin Bangemann and other
officials from the two ministries.
   The higher subsidy is expected to be endorsed by the government
when it meets Thursday to finalize its 1989 budget plans, he said.
   Vogel said he did not see ``any difficulties'' that could block
the proposal at the cabinet meeting.
   Also on Wednesday, the European Economic Community's executive
Commission proposed in Brussels, Belgium, that the EEC should spend
60 million European currency units, or about $68.4 million, on
aircraft research.
   The funds would cover half of the program's costs over two
years. The areas of research proposed by the Commission include
aerodynamics, aircraft materials, noise and manufacturing
technology.

<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices surged near the close
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade while grain futures
finished mixed amid uncertainty over the potential for further
drought damage.
   Midday private weather forecasts that reduiced chances for rain
this weekend in the Midwest fueled the late soybean rally, analysts
said. Wheat and oat futures followed soybean prices higher after
trading lower for most of the session.
   But corn finished slightly lower, possibly indicating the bull
market has peaked, said Cathy Leow, vice president of grain and
soybean trading for Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York.
   With corn plants entering the critical pollination stage, in
which silk and tassels appear, ``we're in the heart of causing
damage and the weather forecasts are pretty horrible,'' Ms. Leow
said.
   ``The fact that the corn market has been unable to sustain
stength in the face of these forecasts indicates to me that if we
haven't seen the highs, we're close to it.''
   At the close, wheat was 4 cents to 8{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.94 a bushel; corn was 2{ cents
lower to 1 cent higher with July at $3.42 a bushel; oats were 1
cent to 10 cents higher with July at $3.23 a bushel; soybeans were
.05 cent lower to 26{ cents higher with July at $9.85 a bushel.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Rise on Report of OPEC Meeting Request</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   World oil prices ticked upward
Wednesday amid reports that three OPEC members might request an
emergency meeting of the cartel to consider ways of cutting
production and propping up prices.
   But analysts remained steadfast in their predictions that the
fractured cartel could do little to forestall continued price
erosion through the summer.
   ``They just seem to have thrown in the towel,'' said Paul
McDonald, a London-based oil consultant and an expert on the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   Prices have dropped sharply over the past month in response to
surplus supplies and a perception among traders that OPEC is
crumbling.
   The next regular OPEC meeting is set for Nov. 21, although that
does not preclude a special session earlier if enough members deem
it necessary.
   The Kuwait News Agency, citing high-level senior industry
sources, reported Tuesday that officials from Venezuela, Algeria
and Ecuador were considering a call for such a meeting. But the
agency said the three nations had not officially contacted other
OPEC members.
   The report also noted that major member states, such as Kuwait
and Saudi Arabia, might object to an emergency session because
there is no guarantee it would have any positive effect on prices
and might even exacerbate the chaos now plaguing the cartel.
   The Kuwaiti reports, coupled with the uncertainty caused by the
U.S. destruction of an Iranian jetliner over the Persian Gulf,
appear to have provided some temporary support for prices. The
price of Brent crude from the North Sea was quoted in London in
late afternoon at $14.65 a barrel, up 15 cents a barrel from
Tuesday's close. A month ago Brent, Europe's most widely trade
grade of oil, was going for $16.25 dollars a barrel.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate
crude rose 27 cents Wednesday to $15.36 per 42-gallon barrel, after
a 15-cent jump the previous day.
   Analysts nevertheless contend that prices are likely to fall
from the existing range of $15 a barrel to $12 or even lower by the
end of the summer.
   Each one dollar drop in the price of crude oil theoretically
means a fall of 2.5 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices,
although oil companies usually do not pass on to consumers the full
price decline.
   The most common OPEC response to a sharp decline in oil prices
is to cut production, or at least give the impression of tightening
its output controls. Indeed, a report from the Paris-based
International Energy Agency showed Wednesday that OPEC output fell
slightly in June to 18.4 million barrels a day, down from 18.7
million in May.
   Yet analysts say the cartel appears helpless to cut decisively,
because Saudi Arabia and its Gulf Arab allies are unwilling, at
least for now, to contemplate any cuts in production.
   ``We're still a very long way from OPEC doing what is
necessary'' to avert a further price decline, said Fergus MacLeod,
an oil analyst at the investment firm Barclays de Zoete Wedd in
London.
   OPEC also is hurt by the continuing Iran-Iraq war, which has
effectively allowed Iraq to ignore OPEC rules and pump more oil
than any member except the Saudis.
   At its last meeting in June, OPEC oil ministers failed to settle
their internal problems and simply left the existing system of
production quotas and prices unchanged, hoping oil demand would
rise this summer.
   Nothing has happened since then to improve chances of OPEC
agreeing on production cuts or other measures to stabilize the
market.
   ``I don't foresee any OPEC move before the end of August,'' said
Pierre Terzian, publisher of Petrostrategies, a Paris publication.
``It seems they will let the prices come down ... to $10 or $12.''
   OPEC's official oil price is $18 a barrel. But discipline in the
13-nation cartel is so poor that most, if not all, members are
offering discounts to keep up their sales in a glutted market.
   Worse, from OPEC's point of view, is a growing reluctance of
some members to adhere to OPEC-decreed production quotas. The
United Arab Emirates, for example, has unilaterally declared that
it will pump up to 1.5 million barrels a day instead of the 948,000
barrels it is allowed under the cartel agreement reaffirmed at last
month's meeting.
   The UAE's move was likened earlier this week by Ecuador's oil
minister, Fernando Santos, to ``an atomic bomb'' being dropped on
the market. Santos suggested that other members may soon decide to
abandon the OPEC quota system to protect their own shares of the
market.
   ``If a country does not respect its quota the other 12 member
countries will consider themselves free to produce as much as they
consider necessary,'' he said.

<HEAD>Trump Proposes Putting Up $75 Million Of His Own Money For New
Casino</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Developer Donald Trump has proposed
putting $75 million of his own money into the Taj Mahal casino and
selling $675 million in bonds as part of his plans to buy the
project.
   In documents filed Tuesday with the federal Securities and
Exchange Commission in Washington, Trump also indicated the
1,250-room hotel and its 120,000-square-foot casino should be
completed by Dec. 1, 1989.
   The total purchase price of the Taj Mahal is $261 million,
including acquisition fees, according to the SEC filing. It will
cost another $493 million to complete the massive hotel casino.
   Trump's planned purchase of the Taj Mahal is the result of a
deal with entertainer Merv Griffin, who will buy Trump's
controlling interest in Resorts International Inc. and take that
company private.
   When the deal is completed, Trump will own the Taj Mahal, some
related real estate, two ocean piers and a helicopter airline that
offers service betwen Atlantic City and New York.
   Griffin will own the existing Resorts International Hotel
Casino, the balance of the company's real estate in Atlantic City,
its casino properties in the Bahamas and other corporate assets.
   Trump has formed a new partnership to acquire the Taj Mahal _
Trump Taj Mahal Associates _ which initially will borrow up to $186
million from banks and from Trump himself to finance the purchase.
Those borrowings will be repaid once the bonds are sold, according
to the SEC filing.
   Trump attorney Nicholas Ribis said Trump has filed a petition
with the state Casino Control Commission seeking approval of the
financing plan.

   A late wave of selling drove stock prices lower
Wednesday, reversing the advance that carried the market to new
1988 highs the day before.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 27.03 on Tuesday,

<HEAD>Dollar Slightly Lower, Gold Little Changed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar eased slightly in financial markets
Wednesday in a lackluster session marked by central bank
intervention, both real and rumored.
   Gold prices were little changed. Republic National Bank of New
York said gold was bid at $438.75 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up
from $438 an ounce late Tuesday.
   Dealers said the dollar held to a tight range in featureless
trading. Central bank intervention as well as rumors of such action
worked to subdue the currency.
   West Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, stepped in several
times, selling as much as $300 million in dollars, said John
McCarthy, a vice president at Irving Trust Co.
   One trader in Europe described the Bundesbank's actions as mild,
serving to supply the market with extra dollars rather than
intervening to defend any particular level.
   ``They are just keeping the market on its toes,'' said Mark
Sexton, a trader at the Bank of Montreal's office in London.
   There also were rumors that the Federal Reserve entered the
market to sell dollars, but U.S. traders said they saw no concrete
evidence of the Fed's presence. The Bank of Japan also was rumored
to have told dealers that it was prepared to intervene at the
opening of trading Thursday.
   Despite the focus on central bank strategy, McCarthy said the
market ``is taking it in good stride.''
   Dan Holland, an assistant vice president at Discount Corp.,
credited the intervention rumors with driving down the currency,
``rather than concern about the situation in the Persian Gulf,
which is subsiding.''
   In earlier trading overseas, the dollar fell sharply in Asia and
finished slightly lower later in quiet European dealings.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell to a closing 133.53 Japanese yen from Tuesday's
134.30 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 133.65 yen. In New
York the dollar closed at 133.38 yen, down from 134.33 yen on
Tuesday.
   The pound continued its recovery, which began Tuesday after
British banks increased their base lending rates. One pound cost
$1.7130 in London late Wednesday, compared with $1.7075 late
Tuesday. In New York, one pound cost $1.7157, up from Tuesday's
$1.7076.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday:
1.8207 West German marks, up from 1.8204; 1.5124 Swiss francs, down
from 1.5148; 6.1365 French francs, down from 6.1415; 1,350.00
Italian lire, down from 1,351.50; and 1.2072 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.2129.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday: 1.8217
West German marks, down from 1.8235; 1.5135 Swiss francs, down from
1.5165; 6.1315 French francs, down from 6.1430; 2.0515 Dutch
guilders, down from 2.0600; 1,351.75 Italian lire, down from
1,355.50; and 1.2168 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2134.
   Gold prices were little changed. On New York's Commodity
Exchange, gold finished at $438.60 a troy ounce, up from $438.10 on
Tuesday.
   Gold slipped in quiet London trading to a late bid price of
$436.75 a troy ounce from late Tuesday's $437.25. In Zurich, gold
was unchanged from late Tuesday, closing at $437.50 an ounce.
Earlier in Hong Kong, gold traded at $441.05 an ounce, up from
Tuesday's close of $440.41.
   Silver traded on New York's Comex finished at $6.819 a troy
ounce, up from $6.74 on Tuesday. In London, the metal rose to a
late bid price of $6.77 a troy ounce, compared with Tuesday's $6.74.

<HEAD>Soybeans Surge On Drier Outlook; Corn Slips</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices surged in late trading Wednesday as rain
evaporated from weekend weather forecasts, but corn prices dipped
and analysts said the drought-driven rally in that market was
nearing its end.
   Wheat and oat futures followed the soybean market in other
trading on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   On other markets, cotton and sugar posted strong gains; the
tailspin continued for frozen pork bellies while livestock futures
were mixed; energy and precious-metals futures advanced; and
stock-index futures plummeted.
   The grain and soybean markets opened quietly mixed, then turned
sharply lower in what analysts said was a response to a weekly
Agriculture Department report showing less deterioration in the
corn and soybean crops than some traders had expected.
   But private midday weather forecasts reducing the chances for
rain this weekend in the Midwest fueled a late soybean rally, and
wheat and oat futures followed.
   ``Soybeans ... staged a very, very strong comeback,'' said
Walter Spilka, a grains analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &
Co. in New York. ``Traders basically looked at the private
forecasts, which still say hot and dry as far out as they can see.''
   The National Weather Service issued a 6-to-10-day outlook after
the close predicting above-normal temperatures and below-normal
rainfall in most major crop-growing areas for the middle and end of
next week. That forecast was in sharp contrast to Monday's
6-to-10-day outlook, which predicted above-normal rainfall in the
Midwest for the five days starting Sunday.
   Corn futures finished slightly lower, possibly indicating the
bull market has peaked, said Cathy Leow, vice president of grain
and soybean trading for Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New
York.
   With corn plants entering the pollination stage, a critical
growth period in which silk and tassels appear, ``we're in the
heart of causing damage and the weather forecasts are pretty
horrible,'' Ms. Leow said.
   ``The fact that the corn market has been unable to sustain
strength in the face of these forecasts indicates to me that if we
haven't seen the highs, we're close to it,'' she said.
   Wheat settled 4 cents to 8\ cents higher with the contract for
delivery in July at $3.93{ a bushel; corn was 2\ cents lower to 1
cent higher with July at $3.42 a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 10
cents higher with July at $3.23 a bushel; soybeans were .03 cent to
25 cents higher with July at $9.84 a bushel.
   The soybean rally triggered buying of sugar and cotton futures,
analysts said. Sugar for October delivery settled 1.17 cents higher
at 13.99 cents a pound on New York's Coffee Sugar & Cocoa Exchange.
July cotton finished 1.80 cents higher at 66.80 cents a pound on
the New York Cotton Exchange.
   Frozen pork-belly futures sank to new 8-year lows on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange amid a continuing lack of demand for the
near-record glut of bellies in cold storage, analysts said. Most
contracts plunged the daily limit of 2 cents a pound for the third
consecutive session.
   Hog futures were mixed in reaction to mixed cash markets. Cattle
futures were pressured by a statement by National Cattlemen's
Association President Dale Humphrey that the drought would continue
to cause liquidation of cattle herds, causing increased beef
supplies in the near term, said Dale Durchholz, an analyst with
AgriVisor Services Inc., an advisory service in Bloomington, Ill.
   Live cattle were .17 cent to .88 cent lower with August at 64.82
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .35 cent to .88 cent lower with
August at 74.37 cents a pound; hogs were .20 cent lower to .50 cent
higher with July at 44.57 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.85 cent to 2 cents lower with July at 32.40 cents a pound.
   Energy futures advanced on mostly technical factors on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.
   The weekly American Petroleum Institute report, issued after the
close, indicated continued strong demand for unleaded gasoline,
which should support futures prices on Thursday, said Peter Beutel,
energy analyst with Elders Futures Inc. in New York.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 25 cents to 33 cents
higher with August at $15.36 a barrel; heating oil was .86 cent to
1.06 cents higher with August at 42.61 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .60 cent to .87 cent higher with August at 50.50 cents
a gallon.
   Precious metals gained slightly in thin trading on the Commodity
Exchange in New York in reaction to the higher oil and soybean
prices, analysts said.
   Gold was 40 cents to $1.10 higher with August at $440.70 a troy
ounce; silver was 5 cents to 5.7 cents higher with July at $6.819 a
troy ounce.
   Stock-index futures plummeted in a late flurry of program
trading linked to falling Treasury bond prices, analysts said. The
contract for September delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500 index
settled 6.65 points lower at 272 on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

<HEAD>Jurors To Consider Whether Warner A Victim Or Participant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NAN HERLIHY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jurors were asked Wednesday to
decide whether financier Marvin Warner was a victim of fraud in the
ESM Government Securities collapse or a cunning participant who
profited at the expense of investors.
   Closing arguments ended in the $21 million civil suit filed by
ESM's bankruptcy trustee against Warner at U.S. District Court
here, only blocks from ESM's former offices. Deliberations were
expected Thursday.
   The collapse of ESM led to the failure days later of Warner's
Home State Savings Bank in Cincinnati, ESM's biggest customer.
   ``Everybody takes credit for discovering the ESM fraud, but no
one knew about it until people from Home State were down here
trying to find the truth,'' said Andrew Hall, Warner's lawyer.
   ``It has not been proved he took part in the fraud. Warner is
the biggest victim of this case,'' Hall said in closing statements
to the six-member jury.
   Hall said Warner, 69, lost at least $26 million of his own
money, securities and real estate when ESM folded.
   Jose Garcia-Pedrosa, attorney for ESM's court-appointed trustee
Thomas Tew, painted a different picture for jurors.
   He described a jet-set world of complex and illegal transactions
on corporate jets and at private Kentucky Derby cocktail parties.
   Garcia-Pedrosa told jurors that Warner, a former U.S. ambassador
to Switzerland, was tipped off to financial problems at ESM in time
to pull out millions of dollars before the collapse.
   ``Help bring that money back to the estate of ESM,'' he urged
jurors. ``No other creditor got out early.''
   The lawsuit against Warner by the ESM estate originally sought
more than $60 million. That figure has been reduced to $21 million
by U.S. District Judge Jose A. Gonzalez Jr.
   Warner, who filed for Chapter 11 financial reorganization in
Jacksonville, placed his fortune in his family's name, Tew charged.
   ``I think we could recover the money from his wife and son,''
Tew said.
   Warner, looking tan and confident, nodded to jurors as they
entered the courtroom and smiled as he made eye contact with each
of them. The financier lives on a horse ranch in Ocala in north
central Florida.
   Warner has said he lost almost $30 million in 1985 when ESM
failed with a total of $315 million in losses to investors.
   ESM's downfall also sank Home State, setting off a thrift crisis
in Ohio and forcing that state to temporarily close 72 savings and
loan associations.
   Warner was convicted in Ohio last year of fraudulently
transferring Home State funds to ESM. He was sentenced to three
years in prison but is free on appeal.

<TEXT>
   MTM Entertainment Inc., the
television production company co-founded by actress Mary Tyler
Moore, will be bought by a British TV company in a deal the
companies valued at $320 million in cash and stock, it was
announced Wednesday.
   MTM, producer of such popular and critically acclaimed series as
``Hill Street Blues'' and ``St. Elsewhere,'' will retain its name,
management and creative philosophy after the takeover by Television
South PLC, officials said here and in London.
   Miss Moore and three MTM officers will emerge from the deal with
a 20 percent share in the buyer, known as TVS, producer of the
television movie ``Mandela'' and other programs aired on Britain's
two independent networks.
   TVS, which is selling an additional 20 percent stake to two
French media companies to raise money for the buyout, gets MTM's
library of old TV shows popular on both sides of the Atlantic and
becomes Britain's biggest independent TV production company.
   ``I'm very excited about it. I think it's a great opportunity
for MTM to grow, especially in the European market,'' Miss Moore
told a news conference here.
   Officials of both companies said they hoped to cooperate on
production and distribution of programs on both sides of the
Atlantic, but that both production operations would remain
independent.
   Responding to questions about possible changes in programming
that produced the sometimes controversial ``St. Elsewhere,'' Arthur
Price, MTM's chief executive officer, said: ``There are going to be
no changes in the creative attitude the company has displayed.''
   In a deal that must be approved by the TVS board of directors
and various regulatory bodies, the British firm agreed to pay
$242.3 million cash for the privately held MTM.
   Additionally, TVS will issue new stock it valued at $35.8
million to four members of MTM management: Price; Miss Moore, who
is a director; Mel Blumenthal, senior executive vice president; and
Tom Palmieri, executive vice president. That stock would give the
four a combined 20 percent of TVS, but Miss Moore's 6.4 percent
share and Blumenthal's 3.6 percent share wouldn't change hands
until 1993 under the agreement.
   Blumenthal and Price will get seats on the TVS board.
   The deal also calls for a second transfer of new stock, valued
at $41.9 million, to the MTM group five years after completion of
the buyout.
   TVS said it would finance the deal through bank borrowing and
the sale of $190 million worth of common and convertible preferred
stock.
   Two French media companies, Canal S.A. and Generale d'Images
S.A., have agreed to buy $99 million worth of the common stock,
giving them each 10 percent of TVS.
   The most valuable asset in the transaction is MTM's library of
old shows that are syndicated, or sold to television stations for
re-runs. The library, which TVS valued at $310 million, has 1,000
hours of programs, including ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' ``The
Bob Newhart Show,'' ``Lou Grant,'' ``Rhoda'' ``WKRP in
Cincinnati,'' and ``Remington Steele.''
   MTM also has a U.S. distribution arm that could help sell TVS
programs to American networks and a production studio in Ireland.
   MTM had sought to expand through a public stock offering in this
country last year, but dropped that plan after the October stock
market crash dampened investors' enthusiasm for new issues.
   The TVS deal, arrived at after 10 months of negotiations, blends
each company's desire to expand in the other's area, TVS Chief
Executive James Gatward said in London.
   Though officials at both the London and California news
conferences said they hoped the companies could jointly produce
shows, there aren't any specific plans to do so immediately,
Blumenthal said.
   MTM reported pre-tax profits of $43.8 million in its most recent
fiscal year. TVS reported net profits of $32 million in 1987.

<TEXT>
   Knight-Ridder Inc. has joined a partner,
Tele-Communications Inc., in ownership of Storer Communications
Inc.'s cable operations, the companies announced Wednesday.
   Denver-based TCI had bought 50 percent of the stock in Storer's
parent company, SCI Holdings Inc., in April. The other half of that
$1.5 billion purchase was made by Comcast Corp.
   Under the arrangement announced Wednesday, TCI's share of the
Storer stock was bought by a new partnership created between TCI
and TKR Cable Co. TKR has been jointly owned by Knight-Ridder and
TCI for six years.
   TKR, of Warren, N.J., serves about 250,000 New York and New
Jersey subscribers. It will own 30 percent of the new partnership
and Denver-based TCI 70 percent. Storer serves nearly 1.5 million
subscribers in 12 states.
   In addition to its joint-venture operations, Miami-based
Knight-Ridder owns 30 newspapers, eight network television stations
and a business information service, and has a 49.5 percent interest
in The Seattle Times.

<HEAD>Ford Announces Recall and Warranty Extension of Aerostar Vans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. announced Wednesday it is
recalling about 60,000 vans and extending the warranties on an
additional 266,000 because of possible wiring, brake and
transmission problems.
   Ford said it is recalling 60,000 1986-88 model Aerostar vans and
wagons equipped with an optional trailer tow package for a wiring
modification.
   Faulty wiring on the vehicles could overheat and cause a fire,
the automaker said. To correct the problem, dealers will install an
additional fuse to protect the wiring.
   Ford said it is extending warranty coverage on a total of
266,028 Aerostar vans built on or prior to March 3, 1987, including
the 60,000 with wiring problems, to correct a non-safety related
brake problem.
   The front brakes on the affected vehicles make an annoying
groaning noise, Ford said. Dealers will cover the cost of
correcting the problem, the automaker said. Ford said the noise
does not affect the performance of the brakes.
   Also, 136,000 Aerostars may have problems with their automatic
transmissions as well as noisy brakes, Ford said.
   Transmissions on those vehicles may show premature clutch wear,
preventing the vans from shifting into reverse or third gear, Ford
said, adding that in some cases the problem could render the
vehicle inoperable.
   Owners of the affected vans will have their warranty coverage
extended to five years or 50,000 miles for automatic transmissions.
   The automaker also announced the recall of 516 1987 and 1988
CF-6000, CF-7000 and CF-8000 cargo trucks because of problems with
the steering mechanism. Continued use could cause the steering gear
to seize during low-speed vehicle turning maneuvers.
   There have been no reported injuries or accidents because of the
problem, Ford said.
   Ford said it would notify vehicle owners of the recall by mail.

<HEAD>Boeing Gets Licenses to Sell Wide-Bodies to Poland, Romania</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boeing Co. has received export licenses to
sell six wide-body jets to state-owned airlines in Poland and
Romania, a top Commerce Department official said Wednesday.
   Paul Freedenberg, undersecretary of commerce for export
administration, said that Cocom last week approved the licenses,
which were granted by the Commerce Department in May.
   Paris-based Cocom _ the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral
Export Controls _ rules on sales of sensitive technology to the
Communist bloc by the United States, Canada, the Western European
allies and Japan.
   Freedenberg said the Boeing licenses require that sensitive
electronic equipment, including navigation and communications
systems in the planes' cockpits, be sealed. Servicing of the
planes' engines will be allowed only in a Western country, he said.
   The licenses, good for two years, will permit Seattle-based
Boeing to sell three wide-body 767 jets to LOT, the Polish airline,
and three to Tarom, the Romanian airline. The combined sales are
worth between $250 million and $350 million, he said.
   ``I think it's fairly significant because you're talking a
potential multibillion-dollar Eastern European market. You're
talking a choice of American technology over Soviet technology and
you're talking about a growing trade relationship in commercial
aerospace. That's all good news for American companies,''
Freedenberg said in a telephone interview.
   Last month Airbus Industrie, a Western European aircraft
manufacturing consortium, announced its first aircraft sale to an
Eastern bloc nation under new Cocom rules. With similar
restrictions, it is selling three A310-300 jets to Interflug, the
East German national airline.
   Freedenberg said there are also applications pending from
several aircraft makers to sell to Malev, the Hungarian airline.

<HEAD>Manville Reaches Payment Agreement With Aetna</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Manville Corp. on Wednesday announced an agreement
settling the firm's disputes with Aetna Casualty and Surety Co.
over payments for asbestos damage claims.
   The agreement provides for three payments by Aetna totaling $19
million, Manville officials said in a news release. Aetna's
payments will cover all of Manville's claims against the insurer
for policies issued from 1980 through 1983.
   Implementation of the agreement was conditioned on final court
orders approving the settlement and an order of the Bankruptcy
Court for the Southern District of New York confirming Manville's
plan of reorganization, company officials said.
   The former asbestos maker has been operating under federal
bankruptcy law protection since Aug. 26, 1982.
   Manville sought bankruptcy protection because of thousands of
lawsuits pending by victims of asbestos, which causes asbestosis,
seeking billions of dollars, and future claims expected to develop.
Experts testified that the claims totaled more than the company's
entire worth.
   The lawsuits claimed damage from exposure to asbestos made by
Manville.
   Manville previously has reached settlements providing for
payments of nearly $790 million with Aetna, of Hartford, Conn., and
numerous other carriers, company officials said.
   Manville's reorganization plan requires insurance funding of
$615 million for a trust for compensating asbestos disease
sufferers.
   Insurance proceeds in excess of the $615 million will pass
through to the Asbestos Property Damage Trust, which was created to
handle property damage claims against Manville.
   Richard B. Von Wald, Manville senior vice president and general
counsel, said that under Manville's plan of reorganization, the
latest settlement ultimately would benefit the Asbestos Property
Damage Trust.
   ``This settlement will substantially increase the property
damage trust's ability to fund claims,'' Von Wald said in a written
statement.
   In 1985 and 1986, Manville announced it had reached settlements
with Aetna totaling $20.05 million for policies issued by the
insurer prior to 1980.
   The Bankruptcy Court approved Manville's reorganization plan in
December 1986, but the plan can not be implemented until all
appeals by claimants are addressed.
   Manville is one of the nation's largest manufacturers of
insulation, fiberglass and forest products.

<HEAD>Investor Group Seeks New Jersey Manufacturer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pullman Co. said Wednesday it received a
buyout proposal valuing the company at about $308 million from an
investor group that includes some of its senior managers and its
largest stockholder.
   The group, which includes Pullman chairman Thomas M. Begel and
Hampton, N.H.-based Henley Manufacturing Corp., proposed a purchase
price of $7.50 per share.
   Pullman spokesman Thomas Davies said that there were 41 million
shares outstanding as of Sept. 30. Henley owns about 10 percent of
the company, while Pullman management holds more than 4 percent.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Pullman rose 12{
cents a share to close at $7.62{.
   Davies said it is not known how many of the company's senior
members were part of the investor group.
   Pullman, which is based here, is a maker of specialty truck
trailers, aircraft seating, automotive parts and food service
equipment.
   Begel said he would ``watch and see what develops'' before
commenting further on the offer. He said he hoped to have the
matter settled next week.
   Pullman said a special committee of independent directors of the
company's board will make a recommendation to the board.
   Shearson Lehman Hutton will act as independent financial advisor
to the special committee.
   If the proposal is accepted, the investor group plans to enter
into a financial agreement with ``a major money center bank'' to
fund the acquisition, according to a release from Pullman.
   Pullman earned $17.6 million, or 42 cents per share, on revenues
of $612.8 million in 1987.
   Henley, a producer of speciality and indstrial chemicals and
automotive parts, had earnings of $6.8 million, or 16 cents per
shares, on revenues of $440.6 million in 1987.
