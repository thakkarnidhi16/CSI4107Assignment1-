   A nearly monolithic black vote and almost 10
percent of the white vote gave Jesse Jackson a super Super Tuesday,
while Sen. Albert Gore Jr.'s Tennessee roots helped him in the
South, exit polls said.
   Enormous support for the Reagan administration fueled George
Bush's sweep, powering the vice president to victory among
virtually all segments of the Republican party, the polls said.
   Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts was helped in Florida by
older voters. Lagging among the Democrats was Rep. Richard
Gephardt, apparently damaged by attacks from Dukakis and Gore
suggesting he had flipped-flopped on important issues, the surveys
indicated.
   While Jackson did better among white voters than he did in his
1984 race for the Democratic nomination, ``This is a hell of a
polarized election in terms of race,'' said Sheldon Gawiser, an NBC
News poll analyst. ``He's still not making major inroads into that
vote, with the exception of Massachusetts and Virginia.''
   Jackson polled more than nine in 10 Southern black voters, polls
said. Among white voters, ABC News exit polls said Jackson had
about 9 percent in the South, while the CBS News-New York Times
poll said he had 8 percent. NBC figures ranged from 4 percent in
Tennessee to 15 percent in Virginia and 19 percent in Massachusetts.
   Surveys of Republican voters as they left the polls found
overwhelming approval of President Reagan, and those voters went
strongly for Bush, who had stressed his links to the administration.
   ``It's coattails, there's no doubt about it,'' said Gawiser.
``Reagan is extremely popular in the South and Bush is certainly
riding those coatails.''
   In Georgia and Florida, for example, the CBS News-New York Times
poll found approval of Reagan at the 80 percent level, and Bush won
two-thirds of those voters, said Pama Mitchell, CBS manager of
surveys.
   ``He's carrying conservatives. He's carrying moderates. This is
almost boring: It's all Bush,'' Mitchell said.
   The support for the vice president was as longstanding as it was
widely spread. Sixty percent of the Republican voters in Georgia,
for instance, had made up their minds even before last month's New
Hampshire primary, and most of them went for Bush, Mitchell said.
   However, she said, Bush also won among the Republicans who
decided more recently whom to support. And in Florida, she noted,
he even won four in 10 of the minority of voters who did not
approve of Reagan.
   Among the Democratic candidates, Jackson as expected enjoyed
massive support from black voters, but also won support from about
9 percent of the white voters across the South, ABC News exit polls
said.
   Blacks made up 25 percent of the Democratic vote, and more than
nine in 10 of them went for Jackson, ABC and CBS reported. Among
white voters across the South, about a third each supported Dukakis
and Gore, and 15 percent backed Gephardt, ABC reported.
   ``Gephardt is not doing well; his negatives are high,'' said
Mitchell, of CBS. ``It looks like maybe this stuff has been
sticking where they say he's been flip-flopping.''
   She also noted that trade issues, a keystone of Gephardt's
campaign, was considered important by few Southern voters.
   Gore, meanwhile, won support from the 27 percent of Democrats
who called themselves conservative, with the backing of 35 percent
of that group, ABC said. Dukakis won 23 percent of conservatives,
Jackson 19 percent.
   ABC said Gore also led among the Democratic voters, a third of
the total, who voted for Reagan in 1984. Thirty-five percent went
for Gore, 25 percent for Dukakis and 15 percent for Gephardt.
   Jackson and Dukakis split the moderates, with 26 percent each,
and Jackson won 43 percent of the liberal vote, to 28 percent for
Dukakis, ABC said.
   In Florida, with its large population of retirees, 47 percent of
the Democratic voters were 60 and over, CBS reported, and 52
percent of them backed Dukakis.
   The CBS-Times poll indicated that some of Gore's support
vis-a-vis Dukakis stemmed from the Tennessee senator's Southern
roots. Fifty-two percent of Democratic voters in the South said
they were born there, and 31 percent of them backed Gore to 20
percent for Dukakis. Thirty percent were for Jackson.
   Gore and Dukakis split the white vote in the South, 35 percent
for Gore and 33 percent for Dukakis, Mitchell said. The two men
also split those Democratic voters, 30 percent of the total, who
decided since Saturday.
   The CBS-Times results for the South as a region had a margin of
sampling error of about 2 percentage points, Mitchell said. The
results based on state samples varied, but mostly were about 5
percent.

   A squirrel that somehow scampered into the
Oklahoma Museum of Natural History broke two pieces of pottery
dating to the year 1200 and chipped a vase, a museum spokeswoman
said.
   Workers searched unsuccessfully Monday for the bushy-tailed
marauder and tried to block entry points for animals.
   ``We've taped up, we've nailed up,'' said collections manager
Julie Droke. ``We're hoping that he left.''
   The two pots, found in Oklahoma and had an estimated value of
$200 to $500, were broken Sunday, she said.
   A 2{ foot vase, found in LeFlore County and reconstructed, also
was knocked over and chipped, she said.
   Ms. Droke said museum officials have always feared a damaging
fire. ``It just never occurred to us that a squirrel could do so
much,'' she said.

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis won
delegate-rich Texas on Tuesday, sweeping the top three delegate
states in Democratic presidential primaries, while Vice President
George Bush coasted to victory in the Republican race.
   In the Democratic race, with 3,506 of 6,933 precincts or 51
percent reporting, Dukakis had 233,204 votes or 32 percent;
Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. had 166,692 votes or 23 percent;
Jesse Jackson had 139,612 votes or 19 percent; Missouri Rep.
Richard Gephardt had 118,127 votes or 16 percent; former Colorado
Sen. Gary Hart had 39,444 votes or 5 percent; and Illinois Sen.
Paul Simon had 13,533 votes, or 2 percent.
   With 2,013 of 5,616 precincts or 36 percent reporting, Bush had
184,472 votes or 63 percent; Pat Robertson had 46,629 votes or 16
percent; Kansas Sen. Bob Dole had 40,808 votes or 14 percent; and
New York Rep. Jack Kemp had 14,366 votes or 5 percent.
   Texas offered the highest number of Democratic delegates on
Super Tuesday, with 183. Dukakis also carried Florida, which has
136 Democratic delegates, and Massachusetts, which has 98 delegates.
   Also on the ballot, three-term Sen. Lloyd Bentsen won
renomination against Democratic primary opponent Joe Sullivan, a
San Antonio college professor. Republicans seeking to challenge
Bentsen were Rep. Beau Boulter of Amarillo, former state Rep.
Milton Fox of Austin, Georgetown industrialist Ned Snead and
Houston businessman Wes Gilbreath.
   Bush, who rents a motel in Houston so he can vote in Texas,
pushed hard for the biggest prize of Super Tuesday: Texas' 111
convention delegates.
   ``Texas is the jewel in the crown of the 20-state Super
Tuesday,'' former U.S. Sen. Ralph Yarborough said in reference to
the state offering more delegates than any other in Tuesday's
primaries.
   Voter registration was up by more than 500,000 and Secretary of
State Jack Rains predicted the total vote could go as high as 2.5
million.
   Bush, who built an oil business in Texas, led in polls
throughout the campaign.
   ``As a Texan, I know our state's special needs,'' Bush said in a
letter to potential GOP primary voters. ``For 20 years in public
life and for 20 years in business in Midland and Houston, I've
prepared for this campaign and the challenge of serving as
president.''
   Bush has staked a claim as ``native son'' in other states. He
was born in Massachusetts, reared in Connecticut, and maintains a
home in Maine as well as in Washington.
   Dole insisted he was giving nothing away although his campaign
appearances were limited and he skipped a major Dallas debate.
   Since Texans don't register by political party, Robertson said
he was counting on substantial crossover support. ``That's my
secret weapon. I've got tremendous appeal among Democrats, and
George Bush doesn't,'' he said.
   Also up for election this year are five seats on the Texas
Supreme Court, a bench wracked by negative national publicity over
large campaign contributions to judges by lawyers, the public
reprimands of two sitting justices and the failure of the
nine-member court to even hear the appeal of an $11 billion
judgment awarded in the Texaco-Pennzoil lawsuit.

   There was nothing super in Super Tuesday for
Gary Hart in the Democratic race or for Jack Kemp in the
Republican. There were no cheering throngs, no victory parties.
   Hart, whose battle cry was ``let the people decide'' when he
re-entered the race last December, made no public comment after he
failed to get into double-digit percentages anywhere. He had said
last week that ``so long as I can be treated seriously, I will
continue.''
   Hart listened to the returns on television at his home outside
of Denver.
   Kemp too dwelled in the low single digits, choosing to be with
his family in suburban Washington rather than with supporters.
   Bad as their vote totals were, they didn't approach those of
others who had stopped campaigning but whose names remained on the
ballot as ghosts of debates past.
   Sen. Paul Simon passed up the Super Tuesday competition to rally
the Democratic troops in his homestate of Illinois.
   ``In a sense, what happens after tonight is we start the
campaign over in Phase II. And what I want to do is come out of
Illinois with a strong solid vote,'' Simon said early in the
evening.
   Later he said the Super Tuesday results ``confirm that the
Democratic nomination process is in a state of confusion and
gridlock'' and that ``the race is anything but over; it's just
beginning.''
   Republican Pat Robertson also had a poor night. Though he vowed
to stay in the race until the national convention in New Orleans,
he said, ``If this isn't the one we'll be back four years later.''
   Rep. Richard Gephardt did well on the Democratic ballot only in
his home state of Missouri.
   ``I'm far from chucking it in because this is a long race,''
said Gephardt on CBS. ``We're going to go on to Illinois, South
Carolina and Michigan and try to get our message across and I think
I can.''
   Gephardt, who has gone into debt, said ``we lacked sufficient
resources to be able to get our message everywhere on Super
Tuesday. That's not going to happen in the states that are coming
up now.''
   He complained about negative campaigning by Michael Dukakis and
Albert Gore, who with Jesse Jackson, split the Democratic vote.
   ``We had a situation where we had about $6 million or $7 million
spent against us by those two candidates, against about $1 million
we were able to spend,'' he said later in an interview with CNN.

<TEXT>
   Riot police used truncheons and tear
gas Tuesday to disperse demonstrators who threw up barricades in
hundreds of blocks in the capital to protest the strongman
leadership of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Reporters saw police beat demonstrators with fists and rubber
truncheons and carry off at least eight protesters in military
vehicles. A newspaper photographer, Jose Melendez of the Mexico
City newspaper Excelsior, was slightly injured by birdshot fired by
police.
   The demonstrations were easily the largest since President Eric
Arturo Delvalle was deposed Feb. 26 after trying to fire Noriega.
   The National Civic Crusade, an opposition coalition of political
parties and civic and other groups, said at least 23 people had
been detained during Tuesday's protests. By late Tuesday, the
crusade said, only two of those were still unaccounted for. The
others were released.
   Small groups of demonstrators, most of them young, built
barricades of garbage, tires, street signs and palm fronds in
central and eastern parts of the capital.
   Scores of barriers were set afire and plumes of black smoke rose
over the city. Most protesters ran when approached by riot troops,
who jumped from trucks circulating through the capital and fired
tear gas.
   Many shopkeepers closed early.
   The clang of pots and pans _ a familiar symbol now of
anti-government protest _ rang out from some apartment buildings.
   Earlier Tuesday, Foreign Minister Jorge Abadia charged that U.S.
military maneuvers along the Panama Canal were ``a prelude to an
armed invasion.''
   Abadia told a news conference that exercises begun over the
weekend by the U.S. Southern Command were ``acts of arrogance that
are intolerable'' and that Panama was ``suffering the aggression of
a foreign colossus.''
   The United States has been calling for Noriega's removal since
his indictment in Florida last month on drug trafficking charges.
U.S. criticism of Noriega increased after he orchestrated
Delvalle's removal.
   But a spokeswoman for the Southern Command, speaking on
condition of anonymity, denied any hostile intent in the
5-week-long maneuvers, saying they were regularly scheduled annual
exercises. They involve about 680 soldiers from U.S. military
installations in Panama and U.S. National Guard members.
   Abadia said Panama ``cannot interpret ... (the maneuvers) as
anything but the prelude to an armed invasion of Panama and if we
are mistaken, let them demonstrate that we're mistaken.''
   Dennis McAuliffe, administrator of the Panama Canal Commission,
meanwhile reported that the canal is operating normally, though
U.S.-Panamanian tension has caused strain on canal workers.
   ``No slowdown, no work stoppage, no troubles, no problems
pertaining to payment,'' he said.
   The government set up dozens of mobile banks and special cashing
posts Tuesday for retired people, who took to the streets Monday
when they could not cash pension checks.
   Banks have been closed since last week because of a cash
shortage and fears of a run by depositors.
   In Miami, a U.S. district judge froze Panamanian assets in banks
there after a suit was filed Tuesday to prevent Noreiga's
government from withdrawing funds. A similar order was issued last
week in New York City, and a suit was filed Tuesday in Boston.
   The Miami suit was set in motion by Panama's U.S. ambassador,
Juan B. Sosa, who has refused to recognize the Noriega government.
   Delvalle, who remains in hiding in Panama, is still recognized
as president by the United States.
   Abadia said Tuesday the U.S. military maneuvers amounted to a
violation of the 1977 Panama Canal treaties signed by the United
States and Panama.
   Noriega, head of the 15,000-person Defense Forces, says
Washington intends to go back on its commitments. He has denied the
drug trafficking charges.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters Tuesday
the Reagan administration was still considering possible economic
and trade sanctions against Noriega's government.
   In a statement issued at both the White House and State
Department, the administration welcomed statements Monday by
Delvalle and the opposition parties calling for establishment of a
``government of national reconciliation.''

the primary results, this obligation applies only to the first
ballot, and the actual preferences of individual delegates may
differ from the way the delegation as a whole must vote.

   China has 20 million surplus workers, although
there are substantial manpower shortages in jobs requiring heavy
labor, the official China Daily said today.
   The newspaper said surplus workers in the work force of 132
million are costing the state billions of dollars and are a heavy
burden to enterprises.
   It quoted the director of a boiler factory as saying his
operation would be more efficient if the current staff of 10,000
was reduced by 4,000.
   But it said workers in overstaffed plants and unemployed youths
are reluctant to volunteer for jobs in repair businesses or those
requiring heavy labor. Such jobs are filled mainly by surplus
agricultural workers, it said.

<HEAD>U.S.-Thiokol Settlements Said To Shortchange Four Challenger
Families</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney for five relatives of Challenger
astronauts says that other families who settled with the government
and with rocket maker Morton Thiokol for $7.7 million were
shortchanged.
   ``That settlement is woefully inadequate,'' said Ronald D.
Krist, a Houston attorney who represented astronauts' survivors
from the Apollo spacecraft fire in 1967 as well as three families
from the 1986 space shuttle disaster.
   Krist said the four Challenger families in the
government-company settlement should have and ``would have netted
more money'' if they had hired lawyers.
   The cost of the four-family settlement, which came in cash and
annuities, was disclosed in government documents released Monday.
   The documents show that Morton Thiokol, which produced the
faulty booster rocket blamed for the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion of
the space shuttle Challenger, paid $4,641,000, or 60 percent. The
government's share of the settlements was $3,094,000, or 40 percent.
   The documents were released by the Justice Department to settle
a civil suit brought under the Freedom of Information Act by The
Associated Press and six other news organizations.
   In court papers, the government acknowledged that the four
settling families did not hire lawyers, relying instead on informal
advice from Leo B. Lind, Jr., executor of the estate of Christa
McAuliffe, a 37-year-old Concord, N.H., public high school teacher
killed in the explosion. Lind is the law partner of McAuliffe's
husband, Steven.
   Michael D. Oldak, an attorney and ex-husband of mission
specialist Judith A. Resnik, represented her father, Marvin, in
settlement talks with the Justice Department.
   ``I think it was a big mistake'' for the four settling families
not to hire lawyers, Oldak said Monday. ``I think if I hadn't been
involved, they probably may have coerced the Resniks into accepting
their original offer. These are people in the midst of their
grief.''
   Oldak said the original government-company offer was ``a few
hundred thousand,'' and ``I told them nicely what they could do
with it.'' He rebuffed them again when ``nearly a year later, they
doubled the offer.''
   Instead, Marvin Resnik settled with Morton Thiokol last month
for an amount he put at between $2 million and $3.5 million. The
government refused to contribute to the settlement.
   The government's treatment of the four families was viewed
differently by Betty Grissom, whose husband Gus died in the Apollo
fire.
   Mrs. Grissom said she received only $350,000, and had to sue
North American Rockwell on her own for that.
   ``I never heard from the Justice Department,'' she said. ``I
thought we got an injustice done to us. They act like they care
now, but they didn't back then.
   ``It kinda hurts,'' she added. ``It stings that ... we never got
treated like that. It hurts when I think that they're getting that
much money.''
   The settlements were reached Dec. 29, 1986, with the immediate
survivors of spacecraft commander Dick Scobee, 46, a retired Air
Force officer employed by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration; mission specialist Ellison S. Onizuka, 39, an Air
Force lieutenant colonel; payload specialist Gregory Jarvis, 41, an
employee of Hughes Aircraft Co.; and McAuliffe.
   The surviving four spouses and six children will receive more
than $7,735,000, because each was given an annuity, which pays
benefits larger than its cost but over a period of many years.
   The total dollar amounts they will receive over time and the
breakdown by family were not released.
   Among the disclosures:
   _The Justice Department did all the negotiating for Morton
Thiokol as well as the government. The families never spoke to
company officials.
   _The rocket maker tried to have the settlements cover any
property damage Morton Thiokol might have caused, such as
destruction of the orbiter and payload, but the government refused.
   _Although the Justice Department claims it cannot legally be
sued by the families of military or federal civilian employees who
die on duty, it contributed 40 percent to each of the settlements.
Only the Jarvis and McAuliffe relatives had a right to sue the
government directly; all the astronaut families could sue the
company.
   Morton Thiokol attorney John W. Adler said the government was
being unfair to the parents of Resnik, a 36-year-old civilian NASA
employee, because of ``the government's refusal to participate to
any degree at all'' in a settlement the company considered
acceptable.
   Resnik's mother, Sarah Resnik Belfer, and Jarvis' father, Bruce,
settled with Morton, Thiokol but the government did not contribute.
So did Cheryl McNair, wife of mission specialist Ronald E. McNair,
35, a civilian NASA employee who had two infant children. All five
were represented by Krist.
   Jane Smith, wife of pilot Michael J. Smith, 40, a Navy
commander, has a suit pending in federal court against the company.
The government last month got itself dismissed as a defendant,
because military personnel may not sue the government for wrongful
death.
   Justice spokeswoman Amy Brown said the government made
settlement offers to attorneys for the Resniks, Smiths and McNairs
based on the same formula used for the other families, but they
were rejected. She said the government would not offer them
settlements which exceeded the guidelines used for the other
families or which were separate from settlements with Morton
Thiokol.

<TEXT>
   Leonore Sarabia, clutching her sweater
against the morning chill, awaited Jesse Jackson's arrival at the
Mirasol housing project, a heavily Hispanic neighborhood where the
presidential hopeful was searching out votes for today's election.
   She had come ``to check him out,'' she said, even though she
already knew she would vote for him. She didn't really know
anything about the other five Democratic contenders, but Jackson
``is more for the people,'' she explained as the candidate emerged
from a limousine.
   Two days earlier, it was Tom Trantham's dairy farm in the South
Carolina county where Jackson grew up. There, he talked farm policy
and shared a breakfast of grits and eggs with Trantham and a few
neighbors as cameras and reporters jostled around the table.
   The white farmers said they were grateful for Jackson's support
during the 1986 drought, when he helped unload trucked-in hay. But
they were noncommittal about whether they would vote for him.
   ``I haven't made a decision,'' said Bertha Tinsley. Her husband
Doug Tinsley, fetching coffee refills for the Jackson group, said
he was a Republican and would probably vote GOP.
   The two campaign stops illustrate the challenge and the success
Jackson has had as he tries to expand his base beyond his core of
black supporters.
   In the South, voters today are deciding if he can overcome what
he describes as an ``ancient cultural barrier,'' and pull white
support here as he did in five northern states with fractional
black populations.
   Today's Super Tuesday election, with 14 Southern states among
the 20 where voters are going to the polls, has shaped up as the
day when Jackson's presidential bid will shine.
   It is virtually certain he will be picking up more non-black
votes than he did in his 1984 race. And he hopes to do well enough
to lay to rest the so-called electability question, the notion that
he can't be elected because he is black.
   Casual interviews along the campaign trail indicate Jackson has
engendered considerable respect among Southern whites. Although
some say the racial issue is not as much a factor as it was in
1984, they acknowledge it still remains for many.
   ``The older group, they won't change,'' Jackson supporter Thomas
DeLong, a 57-year-old white student at Mississippi State College,
said of Mississippi voters. He and others interviewed, said that
among students, a group the campaign is targeting, Jackson has
considerable support.
   Jackson's campus rallies are a big draw, and the enthusiastic
audiences are sprinkled with whites, including Republicans, who
seem to come as much out of curiosity as anything.
   At the University of Arkansas, white economics student Tony
Green was impressed by Jackson's powerful delivery, commenting,
``Wow, quite a speech.''
   He said race is not an issue for him but Jackson ``is just too
liberal.'' He may even vote Republican if Vice President George
Bush wins the GOP nomination, he said.
   Jackson has touted the endorsements of a handful of prominent
white Southern politicians including Texas Agriculture Commissioner
Jim Hightower, Oklahoma State Sen. Gene Stipe, and Tennessean John
J. Hooker, a former gubernatorial candidate with close ties to
former Sen. Albert Gore Sr., the father of one of Jackson's rivals.
   In Texas, with its large Hispanic population, he was joined on
the campaign trail by New Mexico Gov. Toney Anaya, a prominent
Hispanic leader.
   And Selma, Ala., last week saw a historically dramatic moment.
The white mayor who had had Dr. Martin Luther King and other civil
rights activist arrested more than two decades ago welcomed
Jackson, a King protege and longtime civil rights activist, giving
him the key to the city.
   Mayor Joe Smitherman then joined Jackson for a stroll through
streets that saw some of the most tense moments of the civil rights
struggle.
   The mayor said he was wrong to oppose the civil rights movement
and while he's not officially endorsing Jackson, he supports his
message. The message, powerfully hammered home in Jackson's stump
speech, is:
   _That ``the new South'' is one of equal civil rights but
economic inequity.
   _That greater efforts are needed to fight the drug influx, the
No. 1 national security threat.
   _That multinational corporations are to blame for loss of U.S.
jobs because they take their business to cheap labor markets
overseas.
   _That corporate agribusiness is to blame for squeezing the
family farm.
   _That the minimum wage should be increased, and health care and
day care programs are needed for the poor.
   _That overall hemispheric cooperation is needed to help ease
Latin nations' debts, increase U.S. exports and make peace with
Cuba and Nicaragua.
   ``This is a referendum on economic violence,'' Jackson says.
``People who are unemployed are rebelling. People who have jobs are
insecure. People feel abandoned by the government.''
   There also is considerable evidence that Jackson is benefiting
from being a celebrity in a contest where the other five candidates
are a blur in many voters' minds.
   The other Democrats have made multimillion-dollar media buys,
compared to Jackson's paltry $100,000 worth of ads in mostly
non-major markets.
   Jackson relies on the free media attention that follows him on
his 18-hour campaign days, filled with TV-oriented events and photo
opportunities.
   Campaign manager Gerald Austin says the chartered DC-9 that
carries the candidate and traveling press corps is Jackson's media
expenditure.

   It's always easy to spot a presidential
contender going down the tubes in a primary election. He's the one
noisily protesting that the other guy can't possibly get enough
votes to win the White House.
   That's why Sen. Bob Dole says Vice President George Bush can't
win a national election for the Republicans. And that's why aides
to Rep. Richard Gephardt and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. are beginning to
whisper that Michael Dukakis would lead the Democratic party to a
resounding defeat in the fall.
   ``Electablity is looming larger as the issue,'' Dole said Monday
as he tried to stir up doubts about the vice president in Alabama _
one of several Super Tuesday states where he looks like a landslide
loser. ``We ought to nominate a winner instead of a loser.''
   The unspoken message is that Dole fears he is about to be swept
under by a Bush tide of ferocious proportions by the time the votes
_ and the delegates _ are counted in the Super Tuesday contests.
   There will be more talk of that type in the days ahead. Dole and
his campaign aides are likely to produce polls, charts, graphs,
senators, and an academician or two to explain why Bush can't
possibly win the presidential race in the fall.
   Whether that will stem Bush's surge in the nominating war now
unfolding will have to wait for the decision of voters of Illinois,
Ohio, Pennsylvania and elsewhere.
   But curiously enough, the same play is being made against
Dukakis in the Democratic race.
   Gore's aide have begun to speak of a ``very real electability
problem'' with Dukakis, saying he has been unable to attract swing
voters in the South who will be critical to Democratic chances in
the fall election.
   Gephardt's advisers, even less charitable, have started to
whisper alarmingly to reporters about a 50-state sweep next fall by
the Republicans if Dukakis is the Democratic nominee.
   Such talk is designed to mask the prospect of a Gore or Gephardt
failure in Super Tuesday _ possibly finishing behind not only
Dukakis, but Jesse Jackson, as well, and to lay out a rationale for
remaining in the race.
   Sen. Paul Simon's aides are attempting a variation on that
theme, claiming that no matter what the outcome on Super Tuesday,
Dukakis will be unable to garner enough delegates to be assured of
the nomination when the Democratic convention opens in Atlanta in
July.
   In other words, don't ask Simon why he took one look at the
South and hustled back home to Illinois, passing up even a chance
at most of the 1,307 delegates at stake.
   Even before the first curtain is pulled aside to admit a voter
to a Super Tuesday polling booth, one outcome seems certain.
   Super Tuesday was conceived as a chance for the South to rise
again in Democratic politics, a way to mobilize an entire region
behind a white, moderate to conservative candidate _ preferably
from the South _ and push him firmly along the path to the party's
nomination.
   Instead, the two men who most nearly fit that bill, Sen. Albert
Gore of Tennessee and Rep. Richard Gephardt, find themselves in a
struggle for survival in the race.
   The Southern conservative political leaders made their stand in
the final days of the Super Tuesday campaign. In a last bid to
salvage something for their work. Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn, Gov. Joe
Frank Harris and Virginia Gov. Charles Robb all made 11th-hour
endorsements for Gore.
   But the Southerners' concern will be relegated to the back pages
in a few days.
   Dole will want the headlines to say that Bush can't win a
national election. Dukakis' rivals will want the same thing said
about him.
   Unless, of course, the vice president and the Massachusetts
governor actually win their respective parties' nominations and
fight it out for the White House in the fall election.
   Then, the chances are that one of them will win.

   A spokesman for the Rev. Jerry Falwell,
who lost a lawsuit against Larry Flynt and Hustler magazine over a
crude satire, says portrayal of the case this week in the comic
``Doonesbury'' is fair comment.
   ``I don't think anybody puts newspaper cartoons and the ad
parody that was before the Supreme Court in the same ballpark or
the same category,'' Falwell spokesman Mark DeMoss said from his
office here.
   In a ruling viewed as a major victory for cartoonists who
lampoon public figures, the U.S. Supreme Court last month threw out
a $200,000 award a Roanoke federal jury granted Falwell in 1984 for
emotional distress caused by the Hustler ad parody, which portrayed
Falwell as a sexual deviant.
   In Monday's ``Doonesbury,'' cartoonist Garry Trudeau feigns a
sigh of relief before cutting to a satire of evangelist Jimmy
Swaggart's alleged sexual misconduct.
   ``Dr. Falwell's wife keeps a scrapbook of cartoons that mention
him, so I'll take the scissors and cut this out and it will go into
the scrapbook,'' DeMoss said.
   The editorial director for Universal Press Syndicate said
Trudeau is not trying to prove that the court allowed him to
sharpen his pen. ``Garry's just doing what he's always done
anyway,'' Lee Salem said from his office in Kansas City, Mo.

   Producer Joseph Papp, founder and
president of the New York Shakespeare Festival, says a musical
opening on the campus of Florida State University in June may be
Broadway bound.
   ``Betsey Brown,'' written by Ntozake Shange, will bring together
Papp's New York production team and university faculty and students
to create a professional and educational experience, officials said
Monday.
   ``This is an unprecedented relationship. There's nothing like it
nationally,'' said Gil Lazier, dean of the university's theater
school.
   Plans call for casting most of the major characters in New York,
but some parts in Tallahassee, and involving students in the
development of sets, costumes and the musical score.
   Papp said the musical may end up on Broadway after three weeks
in Tallahassee beginning June 21 and short stops elsewhere.
   ``Betsey Brown'' tells the story of a young black girl growing
up in St. Louis in the 1950s.

   Three of the ``test-tube'' quintuplets
of Raymond and Michele L'Esperance left the hospital in a white
limousine decorated with silver balloons to join the couple's three
other children at home.
   A crowd of doctors, nurses and hospital administrators gathered
Monday to bid farewell to Raymond Jr., Danielle and Erica
L'Esperance, who have gained about 3 pounds each since their Jan.
11 birth. Danielle is the biggest at 6 pounds, 6 ounces, said nurse
Pamela Wells of William Beaumont Hospital.
   The other two babies, Veronica and Alexandria, should be able to
go home in a few weeks, said Dr. Daniel Batton.
   ``We can't wait to have the other two home. We'll just start
getting down to being a family,'' said L'Esperance, a corrections
officer who has built a new, larger home in Clarkston.
   The babies were the first quintuplets born in the United States
after being conceived through in-vitro fertilization, which
involves fertilizing eggs in the laboratory and implanting the
embryos in the womb.

   A management shakeup at the National
Basketball Association's Sacramento Kings moved coach Bill Russell
from the bench to the executive suite.
   Russell, 54, said Monday that Gregg Lukenbill, general managing
partner and part owner of the club, suggested replacing him with
assistant coach Jerry Reynolds, 44, to try to turn around the
team's 17-41 win-loss record.
   Russell said he agreed it was time for a change, and was looking
forward to becoming vice president in charge of basketball
operations, a recruiting post.
   ``Every time we lost a game, it was a real hard kick in the
stomach,'' Russell said, flanked by Reynolds and Lukenbill at a
news conference. ``I don't sleep after we lose and, you know, I've
had a lot of sleepless nights,'' he added, his voice quivering and
his eyes appearing moist. ``The losses _ I haven't been able to
handle that.''
   Russell, a former five-time NBA most valuable player, was named
coach last year with the understanding he would be on the bench for
two to four years and then move to the front office.

   Amanda McBroom, the one-time Grammy nominee who
has performed ``The Rose'' in front of audiences of 60,000,
clutched a microphone and stood under a fluorescent light next to
an old coffee urn.
   No, times aren't tough for McBroom. But they are for the 75
people who listened politely in a drafty soup kitchen on the city's
northern border.
   Few have jobs, and fewer have a permanent place to live.
Entertainment, whether paying to see a movie or a musician, is out
of the question, so once a week professional entertainers come to
them, singing a song or telling a joke to a poor but grateful crowd.
   ``I'm really happy I was here,'' McBroom as she retrieved her
coat after a six-song set. In a few hours, nightclub patrons would
pay $10 to hear what the soup kitchen regulars enjoyed free.
   ``It's a look at reality,'' McBroom said. ``You think of the
homeless as a faceless group. That's not so. They're the same as
me, but they've had bad luck.''
   The weekly entertainment at the soup kitchen, which doubles as
the storefront Good News Community Church, was the idea of the Rev.
Bob Tschannen-Moran and his indefatigable volunteer, Joyce Heitler,
who dishes out food each night.
   By day, she's a teacher and part-time publicist for various
professional acts around Chicago.
   ``We needed something around here that's more than just food,''
she said, dropping on a bench to wipe her hands in an apron. ``Some
people thought it was frivolous. They said our job was to feed the
poor, not entertain them.
   ``Well they're entitled to something extra once in a while.
They've had hard lives,'' she said.
   Besides McBroom, the soup kitchen has provided a stage for free
performances by Chicago's famous Second City comedy troupe, the
Lyric Opera, magicians and puppeteers.
   ``It does my heart good to see people doubled over in laughter,
especially when they don't have much to laugh about,''
Tschannen-Moran said recently. ``We don't pretend that this is
solving any problems, but I do think, for a brief time, this
program is lifting spirits.''
   The soup kitchen, within earshot of the last train stop before
Evanston, is tucked between a coin laundry and Fast Eddie's Soul
Food. Last year, the kitchen served 20,000 meals five days a week,
including 9,000 to people age 18 and younger.
   A glance around the tables at mealtime finds gap-toothed
children sitting beside single mothers. The youngsters' pants are
often ripped and their jackets dirty and worn. Outside on a recent
night the temperature was near zero.
   ``We're pretty much regulars,'' said Carol Barton, 31, pointing
to her 10-year-old son, Shaun.
   ``I'm a single mother on public aid. People on my type of income
can't afford entertainment. You have to use your imagination,'' she
said. ``This is a bonus in life. It gives you a chance to survive
the rest of the week.''
   After 30 minutes, McBroom has taken her bows. There is another
evening engagement, but she still has a few minutes to sign
autographs and answer questions.
   Bette Midler is best known for singing ``The Rose'' in the movie
of that name, but McBroom wrote the lyrics. Although the listeners
couldn't offer her roses, each table in the soup kitchen had a soda
pop bottle with water and carnations.
   ``How many times have you done `The Rose?''' McBroom was asked.
   ``A million times,'' she replied, ``but never to a more grateful
bunch. This is a very classy group here. Good night.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the Environmental Protection
Agency says restrictions on driving may be necessary to meet clean
air standards in large cities, but such limitations shouldn't be
determined in Washington.
   ``I can make decisions at the federal level to establish
regulations for certain industries, to establish regulations for
each individual car's emission control equipment,'' EPA chief Lee
M. Thomas told a meeting of the National Association of Counties on
Monday. ``But if we look at smog in our major cities in the future,
that's not going to be enough.''
   Sixty-two cities are on EPA's list of non-complying areas for
ozone, a key constituent of smog that worsens breathing problems.
Many will slide into compliance as older, more polluting cars are
junked, but the worst cities _ perhaps 20 _ are bound to have
serious problems ever meeting the standard, EPA officials have said.
   Ozone is formed by the interaction in sunlight of certain
hydrocarbon and other compounds with nitrogen oxides, a product of
combustion in motor vehicles, factories and power plants. The
hydrocarbons can be unburned gasoline from cars, other compounds
from industrial sources and even aerosol propellants. To reduce
ozone formation in urban areas, scientists believe reductions in
hydrocarbons must precede reductions in nitrogen oxides.
   At the moment the compliance question is in limbo as members of
Congress wrestle with revisions to the Clean Air Act in back-room
negotiations. Congress has imposed a moratorium until Aug. 1 on
penalties against non-complying areas.
   Telling county officials that ``the easy days are over'' in
pollution control, Thomas said ``in the long term we'll be right
back at making the tough choices about how we are going to meet
those standards.''
   ``I can't have full responsibility in Washington of establishing
a uniform system of regulations and controls when in fact I've got
such a diverse group of sources, when the smog problem may well
need to be dealt with by reducing the number of cars on the street,
by telling people they can't drive nearly to the extent they have
in the past,'' Thomas said.
   EPA made stabs in the early 1970s at reducing auto use in urban
areas, notably Boston and Los Angeles, but public and congressional
opposition prompted the agency to backpedal.
   Thomas, who has said before that a serious commitment to the
current standards might have to mean cutting down driving,
evidently expects opposition again.
   In the smog and other programs, he said, ``The public will
demand of all levels of government far more information on what do
these sources do in terms of cost, in terms of degradation of the
environment or degradation of their health, and on the other hand
what do our programs do for them in terms of benefits and is it
worth it to go forward with these programs.''

<HEAD>Farmland Prices Head Up For First Time In Six Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmland prices nationally are headed up for
the first time in six years, but an Agriculture Department analyst
says there still are areas where land values are lagging.
   ``We're thinking there are going to be rather strong increases
in the Corn Belt States and in the Northeast,'' says Roger Hexem of
the department's Economic Research Service. ``We're less certain
what's going to happen in the South and in the West.''
   Hexem's analysis came in an interview and in a report written
for the March issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine.
   The department is scheduled to issue its annual farmland value
report on April 14, showing average market prices as of Feb. 1 for
the United States as a whole and for each state.
   A year ago the Feb. 1 values showed U.S. farmland, including
buildings, were worth an average of $548 per acre, an 8 percent
drop from 1986 to a 19-year low. Farmland nationally rose to a peak
of $823 per acre in 1982 before starting to slide.
   When inflation is accounted for, the ``real'' value of farmland
declined even longer, from a 1981 peak of $551 per acre to $290 as
of Feb. 1, 1987.
   But a lot has changed during the past year, including some
brightening of the dreary farm export situation, improved market
prices for some commodities and the massive idling of highly
erodible land under the government's Conservation Reserve Program,
or CRP.
   ``Nationwide, I'm thinking it's going to be up,'' Hexem said.
``But I don't know how much.''
   There are still ``soft'' areas where land market prices are
lagging, he said. Some states are gaining faster than others, and
it also depends on what kind of agricultural enterprises prevail.
   ``Within the Corn Belt, for example, I think that there are some
indications that Iowa will show a pretty good increase, where
another state, like Missouri, might not show as strong an
increase,'' Hexem said.
   In Texas and Oklahoma, for example, the economy is ``still kind
of soft, so I think that has dampened demand on the part of the
non-agricultural purchasers'' of farmland, Hexem said. On the other
hand, improved cotton prices probably strengthened land values in
cotton-producing areas.
   Another factor has been the long-term payments under CRP, where
farmers can get annual rental payments for planting grass and trees
on fragile land. Those payments have been averaging around $50 per
acre each year for the 10-year life of the contracts.
   In his report, Hexem cited survey results from a number of
sources that point to rising farmland values. Last November, for
example, more than 500 farmland experts, all members of the
American Society of Farm Managers and Rural Appraisers, were
surveyed by the University of Wisconsin for the USDA agency.
   ``Over one-third of the respondents indicated that land values
rose during the August-October (1987) quarter, while over one-half
considered values unchanged,'' Hexem said. ``Less than a tenth
indicated lower values.''
   Those reponses ``point to a strengthening of the market'' since
last May, June and July, when only 28 percent thought farmland
values had gone up and nearly 18 percent thought they had dropped,
he said.
   For November, December and January, the rural appraisers
expected continued increases in farmland values, Hexem said.
Surveys last August, September and October by several Federal
Reserve Banks tend to support the national survey by the appraisers.
   ``The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, representing Iowa and
parts of Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Michigan, reported that
values for good farmland increased just over 3 percent during the
third quarter, compared with a 2 percent gain in the preceding
quarter,'' he said.
   But ``some uncertainties remain'' in the 1988 land market, Hexem
said. On the up side, demand for farm products is rising, and there
are more manageable inventory levels. The CRP ``seems to be
strengthening prices for lower-quality land in some areas.''
   On the down side, farm income is forecast to be down from last
year's record level, in which federal payments accounted for 30
percent of the net cash income of farmers. Crop target prices and
price support loan rates will be down about 3 percent in 1988, and
current legislation calls for further reductions in 1989.
   ``Credit for buying land is available, but interest rates edged
slightly upward in late 1987 and could go higher in 1988 if
monetary policy is tightened to support the price of the dollar,''
Hexem said.

<HEAD>World Bank Sees 25 Percent Drop in African Incomes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Average incomes have dropped 25 percent in the
countries of black Africa during the 1980s, according to the latest
figures from the World Bank.
   ``The seriousness of the short-term economic outlook ... must
not be underestimated,'' Eugene V.K. Jaycox, the bank's vice
president for Africa, said in a speech Monday to the United Nations
advisory panel on Africa.
   The bank released 1987 figures showing incomes were down by 4
percent from a year earlier. That drop followed a more than 2.7
percent decline reported for 1986 and an average annual decline
from 1980-85 of 3.7 percent.
   Exports and imports both declined for the year, but there was a
1.6 percent improvement in prices that Africans got for their
products, compared with what they had to pay for foreign goods.
That was a lot better than 1986, when there was a drop of 25.2
percent.
   Gerard Rice, a World Bank spokesman, said its economists are
looking for a better year in 1988 with the average income holding
steady. Some countries have had continuous declines since they won
independence in the 1960s.
   The figures cover what the bank calls ``sub-Saharan Africa,''
which includes the whole continent except for South Africa and the
northern tier countries Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Egypt.
   Carol Lancaster, who deals with Africa at the Institute for
International Economics, said the countries in worst shape are
those hit by war and drought, such as Angola, Ethiopia and
Mozambique. The institute is a private study group financed largely
by the West German Marshall Fund.
   Nigeria, the most populous country on the continent and the one
with by far the biggest economy, has been hurt by the drop in the
price of oil, its dominant export. The decline in its income has a
big effect on the overall figure.
   The World Bank is the single biggest source of loans to improve
living standards in the Third World. In 1985 Treasury Secretary
James A. Baker III said the bank should take the lead in planning
new programs with heavily indebted countries. Since then it has
been giving more emphasis to broad lending programs, though the
majority of its loans are still for individual projects.
   For the year ending June 30, it is expected to lend Africa $5
billion.
   The International Monetary Fund, the bank's sister organization,
is expected to make another $1.5 billion worth of loans at minimal
interest.
   But the United Nations advisory panel on Africa said the
continent also needs about $1 billion a year in relief from its old
debts, most of them to governments, and another $1 billion in new
aid.
   Africa's $200 billion dollar debt is less than half Latin
America's, but its population is poorer, smaller and growing fast.

<HEAD>Court To Examine How Much Proof Must Be Given Against Sex
Discrimination</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court is beginning another
examination of sex discrimination in the American workplace,
agreeing to decide how difficult it should be for employers to
disprove charges of sexist stereotyping.
   Setting the stage for an important ruling likely to be announced
in 1989, the justices on Monday said they will hear an appeal by
Price Waterhouse, one of the nation's leading accounting firms.
   The company is accused of allowing sexism, some of it perhaps
unconscious, to play a key role in denying a woman a partnership in
the firm.
   A federal appeals court placed a heavy burden on the firm to
disprove the sex bias charges.
   Price Waterhouse, one of the nation's so-called ``big eight''
accounting firms, is accused of discriminating unlawfully against
Ann Hopkins. She quit the firm's office here after she was denied
promotion to partnership, a move that would have made her a part
owner.
   Ms. Hopkins joined the firm in 1978 and was nominated for
partnership in 1982, the only woman among 88 candidates for
partnership that year. At the time, the company had more than 660
partners in 90 offices nationwide.
   Ms. Hopkins had been very successful in getting business for the
company, winning government contracts worth an estimated $34
million to $44 million.
   Of the 88 candidates in 1978, 47 were invited to become
partners; 21 were rejected outright; and 20 including Ms. Hopkins
were placed on hold.
   The following year she was told she would not become a partner
and she resigned in 1984 to set up her own consulting firm.
   Both her critics and supporters at Price Waterhouse said she
sometimes was overly aggressive, too harsh, impatient with her
staff and very demanding.
   One critic suggested she needed to take a ``course at charm
school.''
   A partner in the firm who urged her promotion told her she would
stand a better chance of becoming a partner if she would ``walk
more femininely, talk more femininely, dress more femininely, wear
makeup, have her hair styled and wear jewelry.''
   Others said her use of profanity was a black mark against her.
   Ms. Hopkins then sued Price Waterhouse, accusing the company of
violating Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibiting
on-the-job sex discrimination. She said that sex stereotyping,
unconscious or otherwise, barred her from being named partner.
   The Supreme Court ruled in 1984, in the case of a woman denied
partnership in a law firm, that professional partnerships are
covered by the 1964 law.
   A federal judge ruled Price Waterhouse must prove ``by clear and
convincing evidence'' it would not have made her a partner
regardless of whether sexual stereotyping played a part in its
decision.
   Price Waterhouse did not provide such proof.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here last August said there is
``competent evidence that ... the partnership selection process at
Price Waterhouse was impermissibly infected by stereotypical
attitudes toward female candidates.''
   The appeals court said even if there is evidence that Ms.
Hopkins' personality played a part in her denial of partnership,
Price Waterhouse is unable to prove ``impermissible bias was not
the determinative factor.''
   The appeals court ordered further hearings to determine what
back pay and other remedies the company must provide.
   In other matters, the court:
   _Ruled that companies have a heavy burden of proof when
defending themselves against investor lawsuits alleging the
companies withheld information about merger discussions.
   _Agreed to decide whether states may use anti-racketeering laws
to close down adult bookstores accused of selling obscene
materials. The court said it will review free-speech challenges to
Indiana's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law,
patterned after the much-used federal RICO act.
   _Agreed to use a case from Canton, Ohio, to try again to decide
whether cities may be sued successfully by citizens who say their
rights were violated by inadequately trained city employees.
   _Ruled that financially troubled farmers may not avoid
foreclosure under federal bankruptcy law by promising to pay back
debts by using their labor and expertise while continuing to
operate their farm.
   _Said it will decide in a case from Chicago whether a criminal
defendant's right to a jury selected from a cross-section of the
community is violated when prosecutors disqualify potential jurors
based on their race.

   As voters went to the polls today in 20
states, a survey suggested that Jesse Jackson was leading in seven
Southern states, Albert Gore Jr. was ahead in three states and
Michael Dukakis was in front in the two states with the biggest
delegate prizes, Texas and Florida.
   The ABC News poll, based on interviews with 8,659 voters last
Thursday through Sunday in all 16 states holding primaries today,
also found Rep. Richard Gephardt ahead only in his home state of
Missouri.
   In its survey released Monday night, ABC said Dukakis's lead in
Texas was ``paper-thin'' over Jackson and Gephardt, who were tied
for second in the state. But Dukakis had a strong lead in Florida,
as well as back home in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
   On the Republican side, ABC said the poll indicates today's
events look ``like a blow-out for George Bush in virtually all
states except Missouri.''
   Overall, in the dozen Southern states with primaries, Bush led
Bob Dole, 60 percent to 20 percent, followed by Pat Robertson at 12
percent and Jack Kemp at 4 percent. Four percent were undecided.
   Among the Democrats in the South, Jackson led with 29 percent to
Dukakis's 25 percent, with Gore in third at 21 percent and Gephardt
fourth with 13 percent. Gary Hart was fifth at 5 percent, followed
by Paul Simon at 2 percent. Four percent were undecided and 1
percent supported other candidates.
   ABC said the Southern state results had a margin of error of
three percentage points in either direction, but the samples for
the non-Southern states were too small to generate specific figures
for the candidates.
   It also said the horse-race figures for the entire South were
somewhat misleading because the two largest states, Texas and
Florida, make up a large share of the vote. It said Jackson led in
most of the deep South, with Gore, the Tennessee senator, running
second.
   It said Jackson's strongest leads were in Alabama and
Mississippi, where nearly half the voters polled said they support
him. He also led among voters polled in Arkansas, Georgia,
Louisiana, North Carolina and Virginia. Jackson was second in
Tennessee behind Gore and second in Florida and Maryland behind
Dukakis, and tied for second with Gephardt in Texas.
   Dukakis led among the voters ABC polled in Florida, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Texas. ABC said Dukakis seemed to
be headed for second in Virginia behind Jackson, while he was in
tight battles for second with Gore in Arkansas, Louisiana and North
Carolina.
   Gore had strong leads in Tennessee and Kentucky and a thin edge
in Oklahoma, where ABC said Gephardt was ``running only slightly
behind him.''
   Gephardt was ahead in the poll only in Missouri and second just
behind Gore in Oklahoma and second to Gore in Kentucky. Gephardt
and Jackson were tied behind Dukakis in Texas. ABC said Gephardt
was running fourth in most of the other states and was in danger of
falling below the 15 percent threshold for delegates in a dozen of
the 16 primary states.
   In an earlier ABC News poll completed Feb. 28, Jackson led
Dukakis across the South by just 26 to 25 percent, followed by Gore
with percent, Gephardt 13 percent and Hart 7 percent. Simon had 3
percent, 6 percent were undecided and 1 percent were for others.
   ABC said Dukakis has lost a bit of support in the deep South to
Gore, but Gore has not been able to pull off the Southern sweep his
strategy called for.
   It said Bush's 60-20 lead over Dole region-wide is paced by the
vice president's strong showings in Texas and Florida. Bush was the
choice of about 40 percent of those polled in Missouri, and 70
percent in Texas. ``In most states he is getting more than 50
percent of the vote against his three rivals,'' ABC said.
   Dole averages in the low 20s across the South, while Robertson
averages 12 percent. Kemp averaged only 4 percent in the Southern
states. Kemp's best states in the poll were Massachusetts and Rhode
Island, where he was the choice of about 10 percent of those polled.

<HEAD>For Non-Candidates, It's Too Late To Win The Nomination Through
Primaries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC HUMBERT</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   For the Democratic Party's most prominent
non-candidates, Super Tuesday marks a milestone _ it's too late to
step in and win the presidential nomination through the primaries.
   By the numbers, it just can't be done.
   That's not to say that New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, New Jersey
Sen. Bill Bradley or Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn couldn't wind up with
the nomination. But as of Wednesday, they would have to get it by
making political deals with the announced candidates for delegates
or by swaying a deadlocked national convention.
   Neither scenario can be ruled out because none of the three has
ruled out accepting a draft for the nomination. Cuomo has gone so
far as to say he would accept such a draft at a deadlocked
convention if party leaders made it his ``obligation.''
   Just last week, former President Jimmy Carter said there was an
even chance that no Democrat would clinch the nomination before the
July convention in Atlanta.
   There will be 4,160 delegates to the national convention and
2,081 are needed to win the nomination. With the passing of Super
Tuesday there will be 2,279 delegates available from the 31
primaries and caucuses that remain.
   However, the problem for any late-starting candidate is that
most of the filing deadlines to get on the later primary ballots
will have passed with Super Tuesday.
   A new candidate could get on primary ballots in just five
states, participate in caucuses in six other states, in caucuses
for Democrats in Guam and the Virgin Islands and in a primary for
Democrats living elsewhere outside the United States.
   In all, by winning 100 percent of the delegates available in all
those post-Super Tuesday contests qualified for, the candidate
would wind up with 628 delegates going into the convention.
   Cuomo, talking about the mathematics of a late start, said:
``Number one, you can't do it. Number two, it's irrelevant because
I wouldn't anyway.''
   The major contests still open after Super Tuesday are the June 7
primaries in New Jersey and California. The filing deadlines are
March 24 for California and April 13 for New Jersey.
   In California, some Democrats are trying to collect enough
signatures to get Cuomo's name on the ballot. In New Jersey,
meanwhile, a group of prominent, pro-Bradley Democrats announced
late last month that it would attempt to run an uncommitted slate
of delegates in the June 7 primary to give Bradley strength at the
national convention, if he wanted it.
   In New York, a group of pro-Cuomo Democratic county clerks has
already qualified an uncommitted slate for the state's April 19
primary even though Cuomo asked them not to do it. The New York
primary is for 255 delegates.
   By getting into some of the later primaries, such as California
and New Jersey, a new candidate could demonstrate strength among
the electorate.
   Cuomo says the nomination shouldn't go to someone who hasn't
been tested in the primaries. The candidates already in the race
share that sentiment.
   ``If I lose the nomination, I want to be eliminated by someone
who has played in the same league,'' said Jesse Jackson late last
year when asked about a possible Cuomo convention draft.
   Nonetheless, Nunn said last week that if no clear favorite
emerges from Super Tuesday, the pressure will increase on Cuomo and
the other prominent non-candidates. Also last week, former Virginia
Gov. Charles Robb said Cuomo was the only non-candidate who could
possibly capture the nomination at a deadlocked national convention.
   While Robert Beckel, Democrat Walter Mondale's 1984 campaign
manager, said he thinks the nomination will go to one of the
current crop of candidates, he also said ``there's a possibility of
chaos.''
   ``You will hear about a Cuomo run between now and June 7, I'm
convinced of that,'' said Beckel. ``Whether it will happen or not,
I'm much less convinced.''
   David Garth, the New York-based political consultant and
occasional Cuomo adviser, said he doesn't expect any immediate move
from the New York governor.
   ``I think he's going to do nothing until the convention. I think
it's going to the convention and at that point he's got some very
difficult decisions to make,'' said Garth. ``He's going to have a
difficult time at the point saying no.''

   Political organizers for GOP presidential
hopeful Pat Robertson have been asking local pastors to use church
bulletins to solicit support for their candidate, Robertson aides
acknowledged Monday.
   ``I don't think it's out of line,'' said Henry Hughes,
Robertson's chief organizer in New York state. ``We are not taking
up collections in church like (Jesse) Jackson's campaign.''
   He said pastors should be free to provide political guidance to
their congregation as long as it does not actively involve the
``structure'' of the church.
   But several pastors in this rural upstate community disagreed.
   ``I very strongly object to that and I don't support endorsing
any political candidate,'' the Rev. D. Gregory Van Dussen, pastor
of the Bergen United Methodist Church told the Batavia Daily News.
   Van Dussen said he received a letter from the regional committee
of Americans for Robertson based in Rochester asking for the use of
church bulletins to announce its organizing meetings.
   He said the letter steered clear of asking for donations or
recommendations from the pulpit.
   ``Mainly it was for behind-the-scenes support,'' he said. ``They
were asking us, somewhat diplomatically, to use church sponsorship
and organize support for Robertson.''
   The letter, according to the pastor, said that Robertson was a
Christian candidate presenting the views of Christians and that
``Christians of like mind would support him.''
   Robertson, a former Baptist minister and television evangelist,
scored well in the Iowa primary last month, coming in second behind
Sen. Bob Dole. But his campaign has since faltered. He predicted a
win in South Carolina Saturday, but came in a distant third behind
Vice President George Bush and Dole.
   Van Dussen said it was the first time he has ever received a
letter asking for the church's political support. He said he has
asked his fellow clergymen to refuse to allow the Robertson
campaign or any other campaign to use the church for political
purposes.
   Another pastor, Douglas Spencer of the First United Methodist
Church in Batavia, said, ``I didn't think the church should make
that type of decision. The church contains people from various
backgrounds. The letter sought institutional support for one
candidate.''

   Paul Simon wrote a book a few years ago called ``The Tongue-Tied
American.'' It deplored Americans' ignorance of foreign languages.
It was written in English, the only language that Simon speaks.
   By contrast, Michael Dukakis grew up in a home where both Greek
and English were spoken. He became fluent in Spanish as a college
student on visit to Mexico and Peru.
   Dukakis put his language facility to good use before ``Super
Martes,'' as he called it. He read a lesson in Spanish at a
televised mass in San Antonio, and finished stump speeches across
Texas with the words: ``Poco a poco. Paso a paso. Mano en mano.
Juntos. Vamos a ganar.'' Or, as he translated: ``Little by little.
Step by step. Hand in hand. Together. We shall succeed.''
   Near the border with Mexico, Dukakis did not just sprinkle a few
words of Spanish into his speech: he delivered a five-minute
portion in Spanish after his English opening.

   Like his rivals, Al Gore dashed back and forth across the
Southeast in the days leading up to today's primaries and caucuses
in 20 states. He managed sometimes to touch down in half a dozen
states or more in a single day.
   He traveled in a fleet of four or five Lear jets, a curious
caravan that made for speedy flying time but sometimes meant the
candidate cooled his heels on the tarmac while waiting for his
Secret Service agents and traveling press corps to land.
   Gore's campaign couldn't afford a big jet and couldn't locate a
mid-sized jet to accommodate the entourage of candidate, aides,
Secret Service agents, reporters and television crews.
   Gore earlier traveled in a single-prop airplane, a slow but
comfortable aircraft not much younger than the 39-year-old
candidate. But the campaign eschewed it after repeated mechanical
breakdowns _ a couple times in flight.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Bush, by contrast, had a full-size chartered Boeing 727 to carry
his press corps _ which sometimes numbered so few the entire lot
could sit in the first-class section. And did.
   That meant comfort and convenience for the travelers _ and
sometimes staggering bills for their employers. Campaign aides said
the cost billed to news organizations was in the thousands of
dollars a day for some days of heavy flying.

<TEXT>
   Campaign travel for reporters was feast or famine. Jesse
Jackson's campaign press corps took a petition to the candidate to
protest ``nutritional violence'' _ they weren't getting fed. He
signed too, scrawling, ``Let My People Go.''
   In Gore's caravan of Lear jets, the problem was too much food.
   There were platters of fresh strawberries as well as sandwiches,
egg rolls, barbecue and chicken. On one day of travel, reporters
noted they had faced five platters of food on five separate legs of
travel, plus a bag-snack of submarine sandwiches for a
midnight-flight snack.
   Somehow, they managed to eat most of it.

   Bob Dole's campaign differed from the others in one striking
way: no Secret Service. Dole refused the protection, making a
visible contrast with Bush's almost imperial parade of escorts.
   Dole traveled on the same plane with his troupe of reporters and
sometimes wandered along the aisles to chat.
   His chartered airplane bore the words of its operating airline
on one side: ``Presidential Airways.'' But some of the words were
missing on the other side of the Boeing 737 aircraft; it said just
``Airways.''

   This truly was the ``Tarmac Campaign.'' Super Tuesday eve sent
three Republican candidates to Tulsa International Airport within a
four-hour period Monday afternoon, but their paths never crossed.
The scheduled did keep reporters crisscrossing the windswept
tarmac, however.
   Bush touched down in Air Force II right on schedule at 12:05
p.m. and made quick work of a rally at an American Airlines hangar.
He toured the company's Tulsa maintenance and engineering facility
and talked briefly with reporters before lifting off again about 2
p.m.
   Meanwhile, Jack Kemp took over a nearby hangar for a 12:30 p.m.
news conference, then took off for Oklahoma City, where he
addressed the Oklahoma Legislature at 2:30 p.m.
   Dole was taking off from Oklahoma City about the same time Kemp
was speaking at the Legislature. He arrived at a private business
office at the Tulsa airport for a 3:20 p.m. news conference.

   Jesse Jackson led his entourage through Fieldcrest Village, the
spartan brick apartment complex in Greenville, S.C. where he grew
up as a boy.
   In fact, he said, ``I planted this tree right there.''
   Not so, the current residents told him. The tree he planted was
struck a while back by lightning.

   In some ways, Dukakis' Super Tuesday campaign has been Southern
in latitude only.
   While his Democratic rivals were talking about grits and home
fries, Dukakis cracked jokes Monday morning with a largely Jewish
crowd of senior citizens in North Miami Beach, Fla., where many
Jews from the North have retired.
   ``There's nothing I like better than to walk on a Cape Cod beach
and finish it off with a bowl of clam chowder,'' Dukakis told the
gathering, many of whom, no doubt, have been to the Cape.
   `Of course,'' he added, deferential to his audience, ``I don't
have to worry about the dietary laws.''

   Rep. Richard Gephardt's longest-standing supporter _ his mother
_ led the Gephardt campaign in South Florida on the eve of Super
Tuesday. She faced rush-hour highway traffic on U.S. 1, posting
herself at roadside with a sign: ``Support My Son.''
   The 80-year-old Loreen Gephardt has stumped for Gephardt in
Iowa, New Hampshire, Texas, South Dakota, Louisiana, Georgia and
Alabama.
   ``The last four digits in my social security number are 1988.
It's a good omen! A good omen!'' she said.

   Vice President George Bush, who worried aloud earlier this year
that his supporters might be delayed at debutante balls or the
country club, picked a prosperous section of Houston to await the
Super Tuesday election returns.
   Bush, who long has fought the image of being a New England
preppie, decided to hold his party tonight in the posh Westin Oaks
hotel here.
   Both Westin Oaks and the Houstonian, where Bush has a
condominium he lists as his legal residence, are nestled in an
opulent section west of downtown.

   Republican rules in eight of today's Super
Tuesday states could mean the biggest delegate prize for George
Bush, while bylaws and home-town contests for three of the
Democratic contenders may prevent an outright winner.
   Bush, who currently has 126 delegates, could pad his lead
considerably as the four GOP candidates battle for 712 national
convention delegates in 16 state contests, including Virginia's
non-binding primary.
   While the Democrats allot delegates based on a percentage of the
vote, Republicans in eight Super Tuesday states _ Alabama, Florida,
Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas _
award delegates on a winner-take-all basis in each district and
statewide.
   The vice president, who stands as the front-runner in many of
those states, is expected to reap the benefits of the GOP process.
   According to the latest polls, Bush leads in 14 states that hold
GOP primaries or caucuses, including delegate-rich Texas with 111,
Florida with 82, Massachusetts with 52 and Georgia with 48.
   The vice president also is ahead in Alabama with 38 delegates,
Louisiana and Maryland with 41 each, Mississippi with 31, Arkansas
with 27, Kentucky with 38, Oklahoma with 36, Rhode Island with 21
and Tennessee with 45.
   Bush is even expected to win in rival Pat Robertson's home state
of Virginia, where no delegates are at stake on Super Tuesday.
   Kansas Sen. Bob Dole is hoping for some success in Missouri,
which has 47 delegates at stake, and North Carolina with 54.
   According to The Associated Press survey, Dole has 65 delegates
heading into the Super Tuesday events while New York Rep. Jack Kemp
has 35 and former television evangelist Robertson has 8. Twelve
delegates remain uncommitted.
   The Democrats will be competing for 1,307 delegates in 21 states
or territories. But the party requires that a presidential
candidate reach a certain level of support to be eligible for
winning delegates _ a system that decreases the chance of a
clear-cut Super Tuesday winner.
   Each candidate must receive at least 15 percent of the vote in
any given congressional district or statewide.
   Fueling the possibility of a four-way Democratic race are
contests in three of the candidates' home states _ Michael Dukakis'
Massachusetts, Richard Gephardt's Missouri and Albert Gore Jr.'s
Tennessee.
   Dukakis, who leads the AP survey of delegates with 69.50, is
counting on success in Massachusetts with 98 delegates at stake,
and possibly a large share of the delegates from Florida with 136,
Maryland with 67, Rhode Island with 22 and Washington with 65.
   Dukakis' chief rival in Florida is Gephardt, who has obvious
high expectations for Missouri with 77 delegates, and hopes to do
well in Oklahoma with 46, and plans to fight it out in Texas, which
boasts the biggest prize _ 183 delegates.
   Gephardt has 50 delegates so far, while Gore has 21.80, Jesse
Jackson 27.55, Paul Simon 35.50 and 258.65 remain uncommitted.
   Jackson looks to do well in the South, especially in Alabama
with 56 delegates, Georgia with 77, Louisiana with 63, Mississippi
with 40 and perhaps Hawaii with 20. Jackson enrolled 2,000 new
Democrats in the island state.
   Gore and Gephardt are expected to be locked in a close race in
Arkansas with 38 delegates. Gore is hoping to grab a large portion
of delegates in Kentucky with 55 at stake, Nevada with 16, the
obvious _ Tennessee _ with 70, and Virginia with 75.
   In North Carolina, Jackson, Gore and Dukakis are vying for 82
delegates, while in Idaho, Dukakis and Gore are battling for 18
delegates although state officials would prefer an uncommitted
slate.
   Three Democratic delegates are at stake in American Samoa.

<HEAD>Judge Greene Lets Bell Companies Offer Computerized Answering
Service</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge's ruling will allow the
regional Bell telephone companies to offer consumers new
computerized services that do the work telephone answering machines
now do.
   In his decision, U.S. District Judge Harold Greene said the
risks that the local phone companies would monopolize the market
were outweighed by the benefits this new service and others like it
would provide consumers.
   ``What has until now been a relatively quiescent market is
likely to become a broad, vigorous and competitive one'' that will
make the service available to a broad base of consumers, he said in
a 66-page decision Monday.
   About 10 percent of American households use answering machines,
he said.
   Besides voice messaging, as it is called, the Bell companies
also could provide electronic mail services, which allow
computer-to-computer transfer of messages, Greene said.
   In addition, he outlined a set of computer ``gateway'' functions
the companies can provide to guide a computer user to various
information services. But he restricted these functions to services
like data transmission, billing management and services that enable
different computers to ``speak'' to each other.
   In so doing, he refused to retreat from his September ruling in
which he said phone companies could transmit information services
but could not generate or manipulate the content of the information.
   The Bell companies generally praised Greene's decision as a
``first step'' toward making a wide range of information services
available to the public, but they said the judge didn't go far
enough.
   ``We view this as a start, but only a start. We still are not
allowed to provide content for information services,'' a BellSouth
statement said.
   The Bell companies have lobbied heavily for full participation
in the information services market so they could provide services
that would enable consumers with personal computers to bank and
shop from home, make travel arrangements and even read newspapers.
   Bell Atlantic Chairman Thomas E. Bolger said the company is
``particularly concerned'' that Greene is continuing to forbid the
Bell companies from electronic publishing of yellow page phone
directories.
   Though Greene's decision lifts the legal barrier to the Bell
companies' offering of voice messaging and electronic mail, the
companies still would need state and federal regulatory approval
before they could offer the services to consumers.
   Industry experts and Bell company officials say the computer
software for these services has been developed and could be offered
to consumers in some parts of the country within one to two years.
   Greene, who oversees the antitrust decree that stripped American
Telephone & Telegraph Co. of its Bell operating companies four
years ago, reiterated in his ruling that the baby Bells should not
be permitted to compete in content-based information services
because they continue to control the local phone networks. With
this advantage, he maintains, the Bells could control the
information services market.

his family to Boise, Idaho, with more than a little trouble along
the way.
   ``Frantic,'' a thriller from Roman Polanski, earned more than
$3.7 million. The movie about an American heart surgeon whose wife
disappears during a medical conference in Paris stars Harrison Ford
and Betty Buckley.
   The romantic comedy ``Moonstruck'' was in fourth place with $3.2
million, followed by ``Three Men And A Baby,'' which earned more

   The Tri-Star movie stars Kathleen Turner as a network news
reporter who keeps trying to quit her job, get away from her
ex-husband played by Burt Reynolds, and marry her new love, a
sporting goods company owner played by Chistopher Reeve.
   ``Shoot To Kill,'' a thriller starring Sidney Poitier as an FBI
agent chasing a maniac in the Northwest woods, earned $3.1 million
for seventh place. It was followed by ``Action Jackson'' with $1.8
million.
   ``A Night In The Life of Jimmy Reardon,'' starring ``Stand By
Me'' star River Phoenix, earned $1.4 million for ninth place.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities rose in the latest auction to the highest level since
last month.
   The Treasury Department sold $6.4 billion in three-month bills
Monday at an average discount rate of 5.74 percent, up from 5.62
percent last week. Another $6.4 billion was sold in six-month bills
at an average discount rate of 5.93 percent, up from 5.86 percent
last week.
   The rates for three-month bills were the highest since Feb. 1
when they sold for an identical 5.74 percent. Three-month bills
sold for 5.85 percent on Jan. 25. The rates for six-month bills
were the highest since Feb. 16 when they averaged 6.03 percent.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 5.91 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,854.90 and 6.20 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,700.20.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages held steady at 6.63
percent last week, the same as the rate for the previous week.

<TEXT>
   Fresh snow on the trail continued to slow
the pace of the 1,150-mile Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race as mushers
slogged their way down from the frosted peaks of the Alaska Range.
   On Monday, Jan Masek of Anchorage led a tightly grouped caravan
of more than 20 mushers to Rohn Roadhouse, a remote log-cabin
checkpoint 271 miles from the start in Anchorage.
   Masek arrived at 3:10 p.m., followed eight minutes later by
Lavon Barve of Wasilla. Defending champion Susan Butcher arrived at
3:20 p.m., followed closely by Jerry Austin of St. Michael and
Jacques Philip of Thomery, France.
   Tim Moerlein of Kasilof pulled in at 3:31 p.m., trailed four
minutes later by four-time Iditarod champion Rick Swenson, in
seventh position.
   By 8:30 p.m., half the 52 mushers in the race had made it to
Rohn. The rest were spread the 78 miles back to Finger Lake.
   Racers were slowed by up to 6 inches of new snow as they mushed
down to Rohn from Rainy Pass, at 3,400 feet the highest point along
the trail.
   Rohn is a favorite point for mushers to take the 24-hour layover
required of all mushers sometime during the Anchorage-to-Nome race.
The isolated cabin provides a refuge from spectators and reporters,
and the dogs often are tired from crossing the rugged mountains.
   The race, which started at 9 a.m. Saturday, has been slower than
last year's record-setting pace, when Butcher reached Nome after 11
days, 2 hours on the trail.
   The race is inspired by a 1925 dog sled relay that rushed
diphtheria serum to Nome during an outbreak of the disease. The top
20 mushers will split a purse of $150,000. The winner will get
$30,000.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panama's strongman, Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, is emphasizing class and racial distinctions in
what appears to be an effort to rally support by polarizing society.
   ``The humble, the poor, the blacks, they are the utmost
authority of this people,'' Noriega, commander of the country's
15,000-strong Defense Forces, told a crowd Friday in the provincial
town of Carriazo.
   His regime, under mounting economic pressure from the United
States, has tried to characterize domestic opposition as rich and
white. In government newspapers and on official radio and TV
stations, Noriega's opponents are termed ``oligarchs'' and
``sellouts.''
   ``Whiteys, to the firing squad,'' says graffiti scrawled on
walls in some of this capital's more affluent neighborhoods. The
message is signed VT, for Victoria Torrijista, a populist
organization that reveres the late strongman Omar Torrijos.
   In speeches, Noriega repeatedly invokes Torrijos _ killed in a
1981 airplane crash _ as inspiration for his defiance of Washington.
   VT, like all groups supportive of the Defense Forces' de facto
rule, is subsidized by the government, according to former
government officials now at odds with Noriega.
   Panama, with 2.2 million people, is a racially mixed nation with
African, Indian and European heritage. As is the case throughout
Latin America, people of European or predominantly European
heritage are generally better off than descendants of those their
forefathers conquered or enslaved.
   Compared with the rest of the region, there is a relatively
large middle class. But there is also a big gap between rich and
poor.
   The National Civic Crusade _ an opposition alliance of about 200
business, professional, political and labor groups _ has struggled
to overcome the popular perception of it as representative of
limited and privileged interests.
   In the dining room of the opulent Marriott Hotel, Ernesto
Gonzalez de la Lastra, a leader of the Crusade, rose in response to
a question about the government claim it is ``oligarchic.''
   Gonzalez de la Lastra, in stylish clothes, a Rolex watch
gleaming on his wrist and gold chain around his neck, escorted
Foodworkers' Union official Martin Gonzalez, in humbler garb, to
the table.
   ``I'll let Don Martin answer that,'' said the president of the
Association of Panamanian Executives.
   ``Oligarchy means government by the few,'' said the union man
from a working-class district just outside the capital of Panama
City. ``So the Defense Forces and their government is the real
oligarchy.''
   Noriega does not hold pro-government demonstrations at the
Marriott, and those who attend rallies supporting him are poorer
than the drivers of the cars that join the Crusade's occasional
protest caravans through town. But the opposition has significantly
broadened its appeal.
   ``Noriega tries to represent himself as the standard-bearer of
the poor,'' said Dedys Ramos, saleswoman at a clothing store in the
downtown area. ``But it is the poor who suffer more than anyone
because of him.''
   From a lower-class neighborhood, Mrs. Ramos earns just above the
minimum wage of $150 a month and is an adamant opponent of the
regime.
   Referring to the beginnings of hardship _ including the closure
of banks last week _ resulting from U.S. economic pressure on
Panama, she said:
   ``He (Noriega) is not going to go without. He has food and a
roof. But what about those abuelitos (little grandfathers) who
can't cash their paltry pension checks? That's why you can see me
out there waving my white hankie with the civilistas (Civic Crusade
backers).''
   Supporters of the Civic Crusade, which has spearheaded
opposition to Noriega since its formation in June, wave white
handkerchiefs at their demonstrations.
   A Gallup poll taken in August indicated that nearly 75 percent
of Panamanians would like to see Noriega out.
   A power struggle earlier this month between Noriega and ousted
President Eric Arturo Delvalle sparked the current crisis.
   Noriega loyalists in the National Assembly dismissed Delvalle
Feb. 26, a day after Delvalle had tried to fire Noriega.
   Noriega was indicted last month in Florida on federal drug
trafficking charges. He has denied those accusations.

   ``Cosi fan tutte'' may be difficult to sing, but
one wouldn't have known that from the performance given Monday
night as the Mozart opera was heard at the Metropolitan Opera for
the first time in three years.
   Because all the singers paid such rapt attention to their vocal
lines, instead of tossing them off, the opera in which two men, on
a dare, disguise themselves as foreigners and woo each other's
sweetheart, was more serious than it sometimes is. And it was sung
glowingly!
   One felt the women's real attempts not to fall for the new men _
and the men's pain when they did. In contrast to what happened in
the 1984-85 season, this time the couples paired up as they began.
Last time, they stayed as they had switched around.
   The cast of six principals provided a gem of an evening as James
Levine conducted.
   Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, from Gisborne, New Zealand, sang Fiordiligi.
   Susan Quittmeyer of New York impressed as one who should be
heard again when she made her Met debut earlier this season in
``The Tales of Hoffmann.'' That impression was correct. As
Dorabella, she held her own beside Dame Kiri. They made a splendid
pair and blended beautifully.
   Also splendid were the suitors, baritone Hakan Hagegard of
Karlstad, Sweden, engaged to Fiodiligi, and tenor David Rendall of
London engaged to Dorabella.
   It was good to have Hagegard's fine voice back at the Met; he
last was heard here as Wolfram in ``Tannhauser'' four years ago.
Rendall is a veteran in ``Cosi'' at the Met and sounds even better
in it than before. His voice abosolutely floated.
   Carlos Feller, from Tarnopol, Poland, made his Met debut as Don
Alfonso, who bets the two men that their sweethearts won't stay
true to them. The bass has been a member of the Cologne Opera since
1969. His tones are round and open and he seemed right at home. He
has sung the part at the Glyndbourne Festival and the Washington
Opera and recorded it.
   Dawn Upshaw, from Nashville, was another delight, as the maid.
She was singing instead of Hei-Kyung Hong, who was originally
announced.
   Set designer Hayden Griffin solved the problem of an opera with
six principal singers on a huge stage by setting action inside a
large wooden frame on the Met stage. Simply and effectively, side
panels were turned for indoor or outdoor scenes.
   The evening had a minor problem with hats. In the first scene,
Dame Kiri had difficulty taking hers off, then it fell to the
floor. Then the easel on which Miss Quittmeyer's hat rested
clattered over. Later, Hagegard's fur busby fell off. But nobody
missed a beat.

<HEAD>Washington State Challenges Navy Order Forbidding Civilian
Shipyard Workers' Participation in Caucuses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TACOMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Washington state has filed suit in federal
court to challenge a Navy claim that its civilian shipyard
employees are barred by the federal Hatch Act from participating in
today's presidential precinct caucuses.
   U.S. District Judge Jack Tanner promised a ruling this morning.
   The state's suit contends that prohibiting federal workers from
speaking at their party caucuses unconstitutionally violates their
right to free speech, said David Bryant, a spokesman for the
Washington secretary of state's office.
   Bryant said the suit asks Tanner to clarify the intent of the
Hatch Act by interpreting ``conflicting sections'' of the
regulations.
   A bill to revise the Hatch Act and allow workers to participate
in partisan political activities on their own time overwhelmingly
passed the U.S. House of Representatives last year. It is still
pending in the Senate.
   The Hatch Act regulates political activities of federal workers.
   Officials at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton told
workers recently they can attend the political caucuses scheduled
in neighborhoods across Washington state tonight, but cannot
discuss candidates.
   In Washington, the precinct caucuses are the first step in the
months-long process leading up to a selection of delegates to the
national presidential nominating conventions this summer. At stake
ultimately: 73 Democratic national convention delegates and 41 GOP
delegates.
   The caucuses provide the only opportunity for most Washington
voters to express a preference for a presidential candidate.
   ``Obviously, addressing the caucus is part of the activity,''
said James Sommerhauser, representing Professional and Technical
Engineers Local 12 in Bremerton, but ``most federal employees are
so intimidated by the Hatch Act they're afraid to participate.''
   Sommerhauser said his union represents 1,800 federal workers at
the yard and elsewhere in Kitsap County. The yard employs 11,600
people.
   Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., whose district includes the shipyard,
said over the weekend that the Navy's ``outrageous'' claim that its
civilian shipyard employees can't participate in the caucuses is
one more good reason to change the Hatch Act.
   Dicks commented after leaders of both major political parties
said they thought the Navy order violated free speech guarantees.
   Shipyard spokesman Bruce Andrae earlier defended the order on
the basis of the Hatch Act.
   That law includes one provision allowing a government employee
to ``express his opinion as an individual privately and publicly on
political subjects and candidates.''
   But another provision cited by the Navy forbids ``addressing a
convention, caucus, rally or similar gathering of a political party
in support of or in opposition to a partisan candidate for public
office.''
   Yard workers learned of the issue when they read a Page 1
article in the Feb. 25 edition of the base newspaper that said:
``When the caucus discussion in favor of one candidate or another
is held, you may not participate.''
   Laura Baumgaertner, a spokeswoman for the Washington, D.C.,
office of the Merit System Protection Board, which enforces the
law, agreed the law bars government workers from speaking up at
caucuses.

<HEAD>Skepticism Meets Soviet Call For Condemnation Of `War Of Cities'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's surprise call for
Security Council condemnation of the Iran-Iraq ``war of the
cities'' was greeted by Western skepticism and renewed U.S. calls
for an arms embargo against Iran.
   Iraq said the U.N. body should stick to its cease-fire
resolution, while Iran supported the Soviet proposal and called
again for condemnation of Iraq.
   ``Under the circumstances, the Security Council has to do
something in order to eliminate the damage of the further
escalation of the military conflict between Iran and Iraq,'' Soviet
Ambassador Alexander M. Belonogov told reporters Monday after
closed-door Security Council consultation.
   But when asked whether the Soviet Union would approve an arms
embargo, he did not reply directly and said more diplomatic efforts
were needed.
   Iran and Iraq, fighting a 7{-year-old war, have fired dozens of
missiles at each other's cities since last Tuesday, killing
hundreds of civilans.
   U.S. Ambassador Herbert Okun told reporters after council
consultations that a Soviet resolution on the ``war of the cities''
should not ``undercut or erode'' Security Council Resolution 598 of
July 20 which demanded an immediate cease-fire and provided for
sanctions against the belligerents.
   ``We don't need a new resolution. We need observance of the
resolution which is already in front of us,'' he said.
   The United States has been pushing for an arms embargo against
Iran, and the 15-member Security Council is working on an embargo,
but it has not been approved.
   Iran on Monday again called on the Security Council to condemn
Iraq for escalating the latest round of missile bombardment of
Tehran and Baghdad.
   ``Iraq is trying to spoil the atmosphere for a political
settlement by escalating the current conflict,'' said Iran's acting
ambassador, Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati.
   The Iraqi ambassador, Ismat Kittani, told reporters after the
council session that his government will insist the council act
within Resolution 598 and that other action sought by the Soviet
Union be secondary.
   Moscow has been under international pressure to agree to
punitive action against Iran, or both belligerents. It has been
wooing Iran and is reluctant to impose an embargo against the
Tehran government.
   Western diplomats said the new Soviet proposal might be intended
to deflect world criticism, delay an arms embargo resolution by the
council and portray Moscow in a positive light as an initiator of a
strong peace proposal.
   Some of the missiles used by both Iran and Iraq have been made
in the Soviet Union, according to experts. But the Soviet Union
denies that Iraq is using Soviet-made missiles in its bombardment
of Tehran.
   The Soviet ambassador said he expected a meeting on the Soviet
request today or Wednesday, but none was scheduled.

<TEXT>
   Jerry Burns, editor of the San Francisco
Chronicle's editorial page and a respected newsman at the paper for
more than 20 years, has died of cancer at age 51.
   Burns, who first sought care for his illness in August, died
early Monday at his home here with his family by his side.
   Burns held several important positions during his career at the
Chronicle, including City Hall reporter, chief political
correspondent and city editor.
   Former Mayor Dianne Feinstein remembered Burns' ``wonderful
sense of humor, twinkling eyes and sharp wit.''
   ``He was really concerned about what happened to the city,''
said Feinstein, whose career Burns covered. ``If his byline was on
a story, it was reported fairly and squarely.''
   Chronicle Editor and Publisher Richard T. Thieriot said Burns
was ``universally beloved'' at the paper.
   ``As a journalist, Jerry always saw both sides of complex issues
fairly and objectively, and he maintained a solid intellectural
integrity in the editorial pages,'' Thieriot said.
   Burns, who was born in Hollywood on Nov. 28, 1936, graduated in
1958 from the University of Southern California. He later received
a master's degree in journalism from University of California, Los
Angeles.
   After working for the Santa Monica Evening Outlook, he was hired
at the Chronicle in 1964 as a night police reporter
   Three years later, Burns was given the City Hall beat, and in
1976, he was promoted to chief political correspondent. In 1979, he
became city editor and in 1984 editorial page editor.
   Survivors include his wife, Marilyn Burns, a son and daughter.
   A memorial service will be held Thursday at Temple Emanu-el in
San Francisco.

   With a Soviet deadline drawing closer, pressure is
mounting on negotiators seeking a settlement to end the 9-year-old
war in Afghanistan.
   It remained uncertain Monday whether Pakistan, which is
representing the Afghan guerrillas and does not recognize the
Soviet-backed Afghan government, will drop its demand for a
broad-based transitional government to replace the existing regime
after Soviet troops withdraw.
   The transitional government could ensure the safe return of more
than 5 million refugees from Pakistan and Iran because guerrillas
vow to fight on if the Soviet-backed government remains in power.
   Sources close to the talks, which continue today, said the
Afghan government has shown some flexibility, giving hope that a
compromise could be worked out, perhaps with Pakistan signing the
pact in return for assurances that an interim government would be
formed within weeks.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev says Moscow will begin
withdrawing its estimated 115,000 soldiers in mid-May if the accord
is signed by mid-March.
   Pakistani President Zia Ul-Haq was quoted Monday as saying an
Afghan peace accord must and will be signed soon.
   ``There is no question of the accord not going through,'' Zia
was quoted as telling the Gulf News, a United Arab Emirates
newspaper. ``Allowing it to be dropped is no option.''
   Pakistan's chief representative in the peace talks, acting
Foreign Minister Zain Noorani, said Islamabad hopes for Soviet
cooperation, even though his country wants an interim government to
replace the Soviet-backed regime.
   ``It is in their interest, too, to see that there is peace and
calm after they leave,'' said Noorani after talks resumed Monday
after a weekend recess.
   A representative of the largest group in the seven-party
alliance of Moslem guerrillas reiterated on Monday that the
resistance is determined to fight on if a peace deal is struck on
``Moscow's terms.''
   Speaking at a news conference, Professor Abdul Kadir Kariab said
signing the settlement ``in the present shape will be a historic
treason to the Afghan people'' which he said was mourning 1.3
million dead.
   Sources close to the U.N.-sponsored talks, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said negotiators seemed to remain
cautiously optimistic that a peace package can be tied up by next
week.
   They said the slow pace _ with Monday meetings only during the
morning _ did not indicate a deadlock.
   The talks moved speedily last week with agreement announced
Friday on the timetable and logistics of the proposed Soviet troop
withdrawal from Afghanistan. This had been, according to U.N.
mediator Diego Cordovez, the last major ``difference of substance.''

   The State Department has confirmed that the
Soviet Union is not allowing Lithuanian-American Povilas
Peciulaitis to emigrate despite a statement last December that he
would be free to leave, according to Rep. Edward Feighan.
   Feighan, D-Ohio, urged Secretary of State George P. Shultz to
quickly intervene and Monday requested a meeting with Soviet
Ambassador Yuri Dubinin. He also sent a letter to Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev asking that the matter be resolved quickly.
   ``They have the audacity to tell us now that it was a mistake,''
Feighan said of the Soviets. ``If the Soviets think I'm going to
stand by and meekly accept this broken promise, they had better
think again.''
   Peciulaitis, 64, was born in Lithuania and exiled to Siberia for
22 years, but his parents were naturalized American citizens.
   Feighan said he fears for Peciulaitis' personal safety, adding
that verbal attacks against the man have recently appeared in
newspapers and on television in Lithuania.

<HEAD>Justice Office Adds 9,800 Former Nazi Guards To Watch List</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department's Nazi-hunting unit has
identified 9,800 people as former concentration camp guards and
says it will have them placed on the immigration watch list of
individuals to be barred from the United States.
   The Office of Special Investigations compiled the names with the
assistance of a sophisticated new computer database.
   Names of suspected criminals and Nazi persecutors are
systematically checked against immigration records to determine if
they are in the United States.
   The names of individuals not found to be in this country are
included in the watch list to prevent them from entering.
   A provision of a federal law, known as the Holtzman Amendment,
was invoked when Austrian President Kurt Waldheim was placed on the
watch list last year following a decision by Attorney General Edwin
Meese III.
   OSI has listed thousands of such people in the past few years.
But the 9,800 now to be placed on the watch list of the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service ``for serving as
concentration and death camp guards is probably the greatest
number'' to be added at one time, said the office's chief, Neal
Sher.

   The United States would welcome participation
by North Korean athletes in the Seoul Olympics, according to a
senior U.S. diplomat.
   ``The Olympics would be better off if North Korea chooses to
participate,'' said Assistant Secretary of State Edward Derwinski.
``But time is running out.''
   He added that ``we have nothing but a positive attitude'' toward
participation by Pyongyang.
   Derwinski said Monday the United States will have ``some
additional naval units'' in the region at the time of the September
Olympic Games. Speaking at the U.S. Information Agency's Foreign
Press Center, he said the additional naval presence was ``a very
timely, practical coincidence.''
   Other U.S. officials have said the additional presence probably
will consist of one or two aircraft carriers.
   Derwinski warned that any attempt by the North Koreans to
disrupt the games ``would make them a total pariah.'' North Korea
is one of only a handful of countries, including Cuba, which is
boycotting the games.

<TEXT>
   An airport in Gambia will become an emergency
landing site for the space shuttle under a new agreement between
the United States and the African nation.
   Gambia, Africa's smallest nation, is a narrow strip of Mango
grove swamps, no more than 30 miles wide and 200 miles long, that
snakes in from the Atlantic Ocean on the western coast of Africa.
It is surrounded by Senegal.
   Under the agreement, signed Monday by Ambassador Herbert
Horowitz for the United States and M.C. Cham, minister of works and
communications for the government of Gambia, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration will locate specialized
navigational aids at Banjul airport.
   The landing strip would be used if a failure or poor performance
of rockets causes the shuttle to fall short of the speed needed to
get into orbit.
   Banjul airport is almost directly below the normal flight path
of a shuttle launched into a standard orbit.

   Interested in a staple gun that joins broken
bones? How about a ceramic sushi knife that leaves no trace of that
unpleasant metallic aftertaste? Or maybe a robot caddy for golfing?
   These and other innovations are on display at this year's
National Design and Engineering Show, intended to give engineers a
vision of ``products of the future,'' said Jim Greif, a show
spokesman.
   The theme of the maze of exhibits at the McCormick Place
exposition center is ``the impact of product design on global
competitiveness,'' Greif said.
   ``Although our exports have gone up since the dollar's decline,
they haven't gone up nearly as much as people had predicted,''
Greif said. ``Most American companies are not geared for selling
abroad.''
   Take refrigerator exports, for example.
   ``The American refrigerator market was basically killed off''
because an 18-cubic-foot fridge won't fit in a typical kitchen in
developing countries, said another show spokesman, Dave Dasgupta.
   ``If you send these bulky things abroad, you don't have a market
for it,'' he said. By contrast, when the Japanese began selling
cars in the United States, they totally redesigned the interiors to
suit Americans' larger physiques and longer legs.
   The four-day show, which began Monday and is sponsored by the
American Society of Mechanical Engineers, features exhibits by 763
companies from 40 states, Japan, Canada, Austria and Britain.
   Among the more unusual products featured is the Japanese-made
ceramic knife.
   Developed by Kyocera Corp. of Kyoto, the knife is used by
restaurants in Japan but has not been marketed to consumers in this
country, said Joe Lewis, a district sales manager for Kyocera's
American subsidiary.
   The $35 knife is made of zirconia, a ceramic material that is
tougher than ordinary ceramics, lighter than steel, sharp enough to
slice flesh and cuts a smoother, less jagged line than ordinary
knives, Lewis said.
   The Staplizer surgical staple gun, introduced about a year ago,
is being used by scores of hospitals in the United States and
abroad, said design engineer Edward P. Skwor, who developed it for
the Orthopedic Products Division of 3M in St. Paul, Minn.
   With the press of a trigger, the hand-held gun punches
office-sized staples into a broken bone, helping it heal in place,
Skwor said. The staples aren't removed.
   ``Staples allow the surgeon to do his job quicker and easier,''
Skwor said. When those patients are back on their feet, and if
their budgets aren't quite depleted, they might find use for the
$2,350 robot golf caddy, a remote-controlled device resembling a
grown-up tricycle.
   The golfer simply attaches a small electronic transmitter to his
waistband, and the caddy follows him around the course, carrying
golf clubs, balls and even highballs while keeping a proper 3{ feet
to 4 feet behind, said Bill Reilly, chief electronic engineer at
Gettig Engineering in Spring Mills, Pa.

<HEAD>Defense Rests In ``Thrill Killing'' Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DEDHAM, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for a youth accused of bludgeoning
a classmate to death for a thrill rested their case after
psychiatrists gave conflicting testimony about whether the
defendant had a chronic psychotic disorder.
   Closing arguments were expected to be delivered this afternoon.
   Rod Matthews, 15, of Canton, has admitted killing 14-year-old
Shaun Ouillette, but defense attorneys contend Matthews was unable
to control himself because of a mental disorder aggravated by his
use of a drug prescribed to hyperactive youths.
   Prosecutors say Matthews, who is on trial as an adult, clubbed
Ouillette to death with a baseball bat for a thrill.
   Classmates have testified that Matthews took them to view the
body in a wooded area where it remained for three weeks after the
November 1986 killing.
   Dr. Kenneth Holbert, director of the state's Gaebler Children's
Center in Waltham, testified that while Matthews has had a
long-term mental illness that may have contributed to his behavior,
he should have been able to control his actions the day he killed
Ouillette.
   ``I don't believe he was suffering from a chronic psychotic
disorder,'' Holbert said. ``He could have used his cognitive
strengths to behave in another manner.''
   But Dr. Bernard Yudowitz of Belmont's McLean Hospital said
Matthews ``was suffering from an atypical psychosis which in every
manner impaired his ability to conform his conduct to the standards
of law.''
   Matthews first decided to kill someone after viewing the
videotape Faces of Death, which shows animal and human killings and
tortures, said Yudowitz. He said Matthews' use of the drug Ritalin
may have made it harder for him to control himself.
   Matthews did not kill for reasons of vengeance but ``to get rid
of the urge to kill,'' said Yudowitz, a former director of
Bridgewater State Hospital.
   Yudowitz said he knows of hundreds of cases in which children
and adults are misdiagnosed as hyperactive and given Ritalin.
   ``There is no way of knowing what the exact effect Ritalin had''
on Matthews, said Yudowitz. ``There was a distinct possibility'' it
contributed to a loss of impulse control, he said.
   Assistant Norfolk County District Attorney Peter Casey
questioned the methodical manner with which Matthews approached the
killing of Ouillette and the cover-up of the killing.
   Yudowitz said that the methodical nature of the act ``in no way
contradicts the fact that Rod Matthews is an extremely sick
individual. It's consistent with this boy having a disturbed mind.''
   Former friends have said Matthews told them he wanted to see
what it was like to kill someone. They said he named several
potential victims before settling on Ouillette.
   The teen-agers testified last week about viewing Ouillette's
body only hours after a pre-Thanksgiving pep rally, then bicycling
with Matthews to a shopping mall pizza parlor for a snack.

   The governing Democratic Justice Party
declared its new set of election laws passed early Tuesday despite
attempts by members of the opposition to disrupt the National
Assembly session.
   The bill was passed in less than a minute after a plenary
session was called at 2:10 a.m.
   Deputy speaker Chang Sung-man declared it passed when members of
the governing party on the floor said, ``No objection.''
   Opposition lawmakers had tried to stop passage by occupying the
speaker's platform since the previous night. A pushing-and-shoving
contest began when some governing party memebrs tried to remove
them.
   Chang had to use a back door to reach the podium.
   The governing party has 160 of the 276 seats in the National
Assembly, more than the simple majority required to pass the bill.
Assembly officials said they could not say immediately how many
governing party lawmakers were present when the bill was declared
passed, but most were believed to be there.
   Opposition lawmakers protested the passage, but the spokesman
for the governing party said it was unavoidable because the new
constitution requires legislative elections to be held by April 28.
   The trouble was caused by a last-minute opposition demand to
change some parts of the bill, including the the total number of
lawmakers, poll watching in barracks and campaign methods.
   A new system of electing one lawmaker in each constituency
instead of two is at the heart of the proposed changes. That would
handicap the governing party in big cities and the opposition in
rural areas, where there are far more election districts.
   The new bills would increase membership in the National Assembly
to 299.
   Under the proposals, 224 members would be chosen by direct
popular vote and 75 under a proportional system based on each
party's total vote. The opposition wants to increase the number of
lawmakers to more than 330.
   The new legislation also limits the number of campaign rallies
in any district to three joint meetings including all candidates.
It bans any rallies by individual parties, prohibits street
campaigning with loudspeakers and would exclude appearances by
national political leaders.
   Opposition leaders said they would fight to overturn the
sections of the law that limit campaigning, but it was unclear how
they could succeed.
   Differences on election laws have caused friction between the
two main opposition parties. They hope to merge in time for the
legislative election to avoid the defeat they suffered in
December's presidential ballot by running rival candidates.
   They agreed on the new election formula last week, but a dispute
over future leadership created a new split.
   Kim Young-sam's Reunification Democratic Party said rival Kim
Dae-jung must take a back seat in a new party, but Kim Dae-jung's
Party for Peace and Democracy described the demand as ``meddling in
private matters.''

<TEXT>
   Dr. William Masters and Virginia Johnson have
created a stir in the medical community with their latest book, but
that's nothing new after more than 30 years of pioneering research
into human sexuality.
   Criticism of the couple's new book, ``Crisis: Heterosexual
Behavior in the Age of AIDS,'' focused Monday on its claim that the
epidemic is ``running rampant in the heterosexual community.''
   The authors acknowledged using a relatively small and
unscientifically chosen sample of sexually active heterosexuals,
but said they had enough information to sound an alarm about a
group that may not realize how much it is at risk.
   Their first landmark book, ``Human Sexual Responses,'' is said
to have radically changed the way sex is viewed.
   Research for that book began in 1957 with an unprecedented
seven-year study of sexual response, research that included the
observation of volunteers and prostitutes engaged in intercourse or
masturbation.
   Many credit their research with helping spur the so-called
sexual revolution and opening up human sexuality as a topic for
mainstream newspapers and magazines.
   In 1970, Masters and Johnson's book ``Human Sexual Inadequacy''
was a best seller. It carried the authors' assertion that 79
percent of their female patients treated for inability to reach a
climax had responded successfully to therapy originated by Masters
and Johnson.
   The book brought great attention to the Masters and Johnson
Institute of St. Louis, a non-profit clinic where couples receive
therapy for sexual dysfunction.
   In the early 1980s, two pyschologists from Berkeley, Calif.,
Bernie Zilbergeld and Michael Evans, challenged the Masters and
Johnson claims of treatment success rates of nearly 80 percent. The
critics said the couple had failed to disclose the criteria used
for evaluating success.
   Other therapists said they were unable to duplicate the Masters
and Johnson success record even when using the couple's techniques.
   Evans and Zilbergeld made their first assault in Psychology
Today in August 1980, accusing Masters and Johnson of ``research so
flawed by methodological errors and slipshod reporting that it
fails to meet customary standards _ even their own _ for evaluation
research.''
   Zilbergeld claimed that in 1982, he and Evans met Masters at a
professional conference and that Masters spelled out his success
criteria for treatment of sexual dysfunction in women: The woman
should reach climax at least once during the two-week intensive
therapy period and at least once again during a five-year follow-up
period.
   Masters has since denied making any such statement. He also has
lashed out at critics and defended his research.
   ``In a field plagued by real and troubling problems which
deserve the best effort of the best minds, it is indeed unfortunate
that we must devote any energy to absurd allegations,'' Masters
said, as he defended his research before a scientific forum in
Washington, D.C., a few years ago.
   Masters graduated from the University of Rochester Medical
School and did his residency in 1943 at Maternity Hospital in St.
Louis. He then joined the faculty of the Washington University
Medical School in St. Louis.
   Masters met Johnson when the school's placement office sent her
to interview for a job in the obstetrics and gynecology department.
   They began working together Jan. 2, 1957, and married Jan. 7,
1971. Both had been married before.
   Johnson, who once described herself as ``a perpetual student,''
said she pursued an advanced degree in social anthropology until
about age 50, when she gave up.
   ``Just when I got things going academically, he would start
something spectacular and he would suggest that I might be on hand
for it.''

<HEAD>Dollar Falls Sharply Against Yen; Stocks Also Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell sharply in Tokyo today following
declines on overseas markets, and stock prices fell too.
   The dollar closed at 127.80 yen, down 1.07 yen from Monday. It
opened today's trading at 127.75 yen, and ranged between 127.70 yen
and 127.95 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average,
which fell 10.99 points Monday, lost another 150.85 points, or 0.59
percent, ending the day at 25,465.73. Volume was 800 million
shares, light compared with last Friday's turnover of 1.3 billion.
   Dealers said the dollar's lower opening reflected its decline
Monday on overseas markets, where traders sold dollars to buy
British pounds because of higher interest rates in Britain.
   The U.S. currency rose slightly during Tokyo trading because of
profit-taking and covering of dollar-short positions by traders,
they added.
   ``A lack of follow-up selling from corporate players including
Japanese exporters is prompting traders to cover short positions,''
said Masaharu Takenaka, a senior currency trader for the Bank of
Tokyo.
   The weaker dollar dragged down prices on the stock exchange,
where traders stayed on the sidelines waiting for a market
adjustment following recent sharp gains.
   ``The market is clearly very tired,'' said Ron Napier, a vice
president at Salomon Brothers. He said rising interest rates also
have dampened buying sentiment in Tokyo. ``We've seen a very dull
market, and that's the way it's going to be for a while,'' he said.

<HEAD>Study: Courses, Income More Important Than Ethnicity To College
Test Scores</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ANTCZAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 12-state study found that advanced math
and science courses and family income were more important factors
than ethnicity in how Hispanic high school students scored on
college entrance tests.
   The study of 1,928 Hispanic and non-Hispanic white students,
presented Monday to the National Association of Secondary School
Principals, also found that scores of both groups increased with
the size of schools they attended.
   George A. Chambers, professor of educational administration at
the University of Iowa, and researcher Phyllis S. Peterson studied
1987 scores on the American College Test, the predominant college
admission test in 28 states.
   ``The purpose of the study was to compare how Hispanic students
and Caucasian students score when the two groups are similarly
situated,'' Chambers said.
   Students in the study were from Arizona, California, Colorado,
Florida, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma,
Texas and Utah.
   The students were divided equally among two groups identified as
Caucasian and Hispanic, which included two subdivisions of
Mexican-Americans and Puerto Ricans, Cubans and others.
   The study created 964 pairs of one Hispanic and one non-Hispanic
white student matched on the basis of 13 common attributes: high
school, family income range, mathematics courses (algebra 1,
algebra 2, geometry, trigonometry, calculus), science courses
(general science, biology, chemistry, physics), gender and number
of siblings.
   According to the study, the U.S. average composite ACT score is
15.2 for Mexican-Americans, 16.6 for the Puerto-Rican-Cuban group,
and 19.6 for non-Hispanic whites. The ACT is scored on a scale of
one to 36 and is taken annually by more than 1 million students.
   When matched, or ``similarly situated,'' the non-Hispanics had a
mean score of 18.7 compared with 16.7 for the Mexican-American
group, a difference of just two points instead of the national
difference of 4.4 points.
   The non-Hispanics scored 19.8 and Puerto Rican-Cuban students
scored 18.9 when similarly situated, a difference in composite
score points of just 0.9 rather than the three points in the U.S.
average.
   In addition, Chambers said, the statistical analysis found that
course work is more important than the level of income in
determining scores.
   He said, however, that the higher the income level, the greater
the tendency for a student to take advanced courses. That is
probably because of factors such as the expectations of parents who
have college educations, he said.
   ``It's not income necessarily in and of itself that makes the
difference. Rather, it's the things that result from income,''
Chambers said.
   ``So we need to find a way to raise the expectations. We must
overcome this force of income.''
   The study also found that when schools were grouped into five
categories according to the size of the graduating class, ranging
from less than 200 to 900 or more, Hispanic and non-Hispanic scores
went up with size, possibly because the larger schools have an
expanded curriculum. Each recorded an overall gain of two points.
   ``While many believe big is bad, if you look at the data here,
it suggests big is better,'' Chambers said.
   The principals' association, which was meeting here this week,
represents 38,000 educators in middle, junior high and high schools
nationwide.

^WASHINGTON WIRE: GOP Vents Fury on Order to Arrest Absent Senators</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fuming and sputtering, the Senate is writing a
new chapter in the long and tumultuous history of the legislative
filibuster.
   Actually the chapter is written, but the fuming and sputtering
about it continue unabated.
   ``The other side needs to vent itself from time to time, and
this is one of those occasions,'' said Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo.,
the Senate's acting minority leader, as Senate Republicans engaged
in four hours of complaint about it last week.
   ``Crybaby stuff!'' exclaimed Senate Majority Leader Robert C.
Byrd, D-W.Va., who initiated the order to the Senate
sergeant-at-arms to compel the attendance of absent senators.
   The facts:
   On Feb. 23, after midnight, as the Senate was deep into an
old-fashioned, all-night, Republican-led filibuster against a
congressional campaign financing bill sought by majority Democrats,
an arrest warrant was issued for GOP senators whose flight from the
Senate chamber prevented the quorum needed to do business.
   Such a warrant was issued on Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., who had
locked himself in his Senate office. Packwood was carried onto the
Senate floor, feet first, and the quorum was established.
   ``Keystone cops,'' Republican senators cried.
   ``A low comedy about a legislature in a banana republic,''
steamed New York Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato.
   ``I am afraid we are playing a giant game of `gotcha,' to see
who can get the other side,'' said Sen. Daniel Evans, R-Wash.
   ``Under this arrest warrant for senators does the
sergeant-at-arms have the right to enter my home?'' Evans asked.
``Does he have the right to seize me from my bed, for heavens'
sake, in order to return me to the Senate floor?''
   ``The rules permit us to delay things for endless periods of
time and to stay here all night and to arrest each other, and if
all we do is to exhaust what is permitted under the rules then we
create real havoc,'' said Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo.
   ``Why should a U.S. senator be arrested for less cause than a
common criminal?'' asked Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.
   Hold on, said Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, a former federal
judge. The warrant was issued only to compel Packwood's attendance
on the Senate floor, ``that is, do that which the senator was
elected to do.''
   There was nothing criminal about it, Mitchell said.
   The rule in question is based on the provision in the
Constitution establishing a simple majority of the House and the
Senate as the number needed to establish a quorum to do business
and authorizing a smaller number ``to compel the presence of absent
members, in such manner, and under such penalties as each House may
provide.''
   Each house has so provided, and when virtually all Republican
senators disappeared, the sergeant-at-arms was authorized to compel
their presence. Hence the Packwood arrest.
   Led by Specter, several Republican senators demanded the rules
be changed to bar the arrest of senators between the hours of 11
p.m. and 8 a.m., among other things.
   Byrd said that would ``cement in stone the ability of senators
to stop any action simply by hiding in their offices.''
   ``The Senate arrest was not a game,'' Byrd said. ``It was not a
laughing matter.
   ``Imagine senators, who are supposed to be grown-up people,
adults, elected by the people to serve here _ and most senators
would have given their right arm to serve here _ imagine seeing
them run down the hall, run when they see the sergeant-at-arms.
They made a calculated decision to run and hide, barricade their
offices, put chairs against the doors.''
   ``Now they want to cry about it,'' Byrd said. ``It was not the
arrest that caused us to look bad. It was the spectacle of senators
running to avoid coming to the Senate floor. ... We are not elected
to play games like children.''
   The complaints and the counter complaints rolled on and finally
there was a final complaint.
   The arrest warrants that were written but not served had been
destroyed.
   Many Republican members said they wanted copies as mementos.
   ``Never in my 63 years have I had an arrest warrant issued,''
Evans told the Senate.
   ``Because it was unique I asked if I could have a copy so that I
could put it in my scrapbook and have it available to show my
children and my grandchildren,'' he said.
   ``Now I find they are, somehow, not available.''

<HEAD>Builder Trying To Save Ark Before Court-Ordered Deadline To
Destroy It</HEAD>

   A woman who built an 80-ton wooden ark from
salvaged timber is dismantling part of the vessel in an effort to
beat a court deadline ordering it off a church's property.
   But Kea Tawana, who calls the ark her ``life's sweat and
blood,'' says she needs more time to move the 86-foot-long craft,
which has been termed a work of art by the American Museum of Folk
Art but an eyesore by the city.
   ``It's consumed 20 years of my life. Short of a miracle ... the
ark is doomed,'' Tawana said.
   Tawana had been working under a March 31 court deadline to move
the ark from the parking lot of the Humanity Baptist Church to
Newark Bay, three-quarters of a mile away. Superior Court Judge
Harry A. Margolis recently extended the deadline until April 15.
   But Tawana, who says she built the ark from oak, hemlock and
pine to live in, not for religious reasons, says she needs more
time to dismantle part of it for the move and obtain Coast Guard
approval of the ship's seaworthiness.
   ``Bad weather this winter prevented work on the ship from
continuing,'' Tawana said, adding that she will ask Margolis at a
March 22 hearing for a 90-day extension. ``April 15 does not give
me enough time to render the ship floatable.''
   Tawana said she plans to sail the ark to the Great Lakes region
and live there, although she did not say where.
   Newark officials have long wanted the ark torn down. The city
went to court over the issue, saying it was an eyesore and health
hazard and violated zoning laws.
   However, Margolis last spring prohibited the city from
destroying it after the American Museum of Folk Art in New York
City wrote to Mayor Sharpe James and Gov. Thomas H. Kean, urging
them to preserve the structure.
   ``The ark is a very important and very rare example of urban
folk art expression,'' said Didi Barrett, the museum's director of
publications.
   The Humanity Baptist Church had allowed Tawana to live on the
property as a caretaker in a ramshackle house next to the ark until
last year, when it ended the relationship, saying that the court
battle over the ark cost too much.
   ``The city wants to drive me out and turn this over to
developers for condominiums,'' Tawana said.
   But Audrey Davidson, assistant corporate counsel for Newark,
said zoning laws are the issue.
   ``I have no idea whether the city is trying to build something
there. All I know is that the structure there is illegal,'' Ms.
Davidson said.
   Tawana said she will cut 4 feet off beams in the ark to reduce
the vessel's height to 17 feet from 21 feet so it will not get
snagged on cables running over streets on the trip to Newark Bay.

<HEAD>Law Limiting Campaigning Passes After Scuffle In Assembly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governing party rammed an election
law that limits campaigning through the legislature today over the
objection of opposition lawmakers who seized the podium and started
a scuffle.
   Leaders of the governing Democratic Justice Party, protected by
guards, ended hours of furious arguments and scuffling by suddenly
calling for a vote and declaring the bill passed before the
opposition could react.
   The governing party, which has a strong majority in the National
Assembly, passed the bill by a voice vote in a few seconds.
   Opposition lawmakers rushed to the podium to try to drag down
Vice Speaker Chang Sung-man and halt the vote but were blocked by
assembly guards.
   Outraged opposition representatives screamed insults at
Democratic Justice Party leaders after they were caught by surprise.
   The new law revises the assembly's constituency system to one
lawmaker per district instead of two and clears the way for
elections expected to be held in late April. The number of seats
will increase from 276 to 299.
   The new law also limits the number of campaign rallies in any
district to three joint meetings including all candidates. It bans
any rallies by individual parties, prohibits street campaigning
with loudspeakers and excludes appearances by national political
leaders.
   Opposition leaders said they would fight to overturn the
sections of the law that limit campaigning, but it was unclear how
they could succeed.
   Opposition lawmakers occupied the podium for almost three hours
to prevent passage of the bill after dragging the vice speaker from
his chair and scuffling with government legislators.
   The government broke the deadlock when Chang surrounded by
guards suddenly took to the podium, called for a voice vote and
passed the bill.
   Kim Tae-ryong, spokesman of the opposition Reunification
Democratic Party, said the government's actions proved it did not
support democracy.
   ``The bill contains various malicious clauses designed to steal
votes,'' he said after the bill was passed.
   The government, which had favored retention of the existing two
member system, changed its position after the opposition repeatedly
blocked attempts in the assembly to pass a new election law. The
law had to be passed to hold elections scheduled to be held by
April.
   Opposition leaders said the bill would place excessive
restrictions on campaigning.
   The opposition also wanted open counting of absentee ballots,
charging that the government has used absentee ballots in the past
to rig elections.
   The dispute, which lasted for almost two months, reflected the
opposition's refusal to work with the government and deep divisions
between the two sides.
   Opposition leaders continue to insist that President Roh Tae-woo
and the governing party won presidential elections in December
through massive fraud. Some top opposition leaders have refused to
recognize Roh's election.
   Roh won with less than 50 percent of the vote because two
opposition leaders split the opposition vote.
   The new law is expected to diminish the government's electoral
chances in urban areas where it lacks sufficient strength to win
majorities. The governing party had counted on coming in second in
urban areas in the past to gain seats.
   But the governing party is also expected to gain in rural areas
under the new system since it is strongest in the countryside. Roh
has promised broad democratic reforms to end decades of
authoritarian rule and has said that elections will be fair and
democratic.
   The bill increases the number of electoral districts from 184 to
224 and provides for one lawmaker per district.
   The existing system, whereby the winning party gets two-thirds
of 92 bonus seats, also was changed so that it gets half of 75
bonus seats with the rest being divided among other parties on the
basis of votes.
   The bonus system is designed to avoid deadlock in the assembly
by giving the main party a clear majority.

<HEAD>Kalikow, Murdoch Complete Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Post has officially become the
property of real estate developer Peter Kalikow, who paid $37.6
million for the tabloid that has been losing money and circulation
for years.
   ``It is my intention to stop the financial losses of the New
York Post,'' Kalikow said Monday in a statement after the papers
transferring ownership were signed. ``The paper will be a winner
financially and editorially.''
   Kalikow acquired the Post after the paper's 10 unions agreed to
a $22 million in concessions, which included a last-minute $3
million gift from then-owner Rupert Murdoch.
   ``The rescue of the Post is nothing less than an historic
moment,'' Kalikow said.
   ``There was not one person involved in negotiations that did not
go the extra mile in an effort to keep this great New York
institution from disappearing. I want to thank all of our unions
and employees for their heroic efforts.''
   Union leaders were to sign formal papers today and planned to
meet with Kalikow on Thursday to ``get to know each other,'' said
George McDonald, president of the Allied Printing Trades Council,
which represents eight of the unions.
   ``We're delighted, really delighted, glad it's all over.''
   Murdoch, who sold the paper to comply with federal regulations
barring ownership of two media outlets in one city, claimed he was
losing $100,000 a day on the Post and lost $150 million in the 12
years he owned it.
   Kalikow has pledged $2 million to promote the newspaper.
   ``I am committed to expanding its readership base through
millions of dollars in promotion, adding features to the paper,
greatly expanding its investigative reporting and strengthening its
advertising revenues to make the paper profitable on a long-term
basis.''
   Under Murdoch, whom Kalikow called ``one of the great
contemporary publishers,'' the tabloid had a reputation for
sensational coverage, with blaring headlines and plenty of gossip.
   New publisher Peter Price said ``my role is to make it work.
   ``I think Peter Kalikow has made an enormous financial
commitment and it's my challenge and opportunity to put the pieces
together and make a real business out of the Post and not just a
good newspaper,'' Price said.
   Spokesman Howard Rubenstein declined to say what specific
changes Kalikow and Price would make in the appearance and content
of the Post, the nation's oldest continuously published daily
newspaper, founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton.
   Price, however, noted that ``the big difference between what we
are able to do versus what others before us have tried to do is
that Peter Kalikow and I share a sense of the city.
   ``We are both single-minded about the New York Post. We are both
single-minded about making this paper a permanent fixture in the
New York City scene.''

   Hasan Ahmed sat near a pile of
rust-colored bricks, using a small bar of metal to pound the bricks
into gravel.
   It was election day, declared a national holiday by the
government and a nationwide general strike by the political
opposition.
   Sixty-year-old Ahmed knew nothing about the holiday or strike,
but he knew he needed his 50 cents in daily earnings.
   The turmoil of the parliamentary elections last week, in which
13 people died in clashes, passed by Ahmed who still has four
children at home. But he and the more than 80 million other
Bangladeshis who live below the poverty line still are caught up in
its results.
   The election made no immediate headway in ending the stalemate
between President Hussain Muhammad Ershad and major opposition
parties demanding his ouster.
   Ershad, whose Jatiya Party won a predictable parliamentary
majority, refuses to resign. The opposition vows to keep up its
nearly four-month campaign of general strikes that is eroding the
already weak economy.
   Economic growth was an expected 5 percent this year, but the
strikes and severe floods last summer have reduced the projection
to 2 percent.
   ``We are in very bad shape,'' said A.S. Mahmud, president of the
Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry. ``The politicians, they
don't think of or try to understand the impact on the economy.''
   Mahmud said the 25 days of general strikes called since November
last year were deeply affecting the country's new garment industry
and could scare off foreign investment.
   The country of 105 million people has an estimated 30 percent
unemployment and under-employment. More than 80 percent of the
people live below the poverty line, defined by the World Health
Organization as not earning enough for a diet of 1,800 calories
daily. About 80 percent also are illiterate.
   While Mahmud talked in terms of long-range economic
consequences, Abdul Ghafoor saw more immediate effects of the
political turmoil. It means trouble in feeding his family.
   Ghafoor, 45, drives a bicycle rickshaw and has a wife and six
children. He averages about $1.65 in earnings daily and says he
does not work on a strike day for fear of being attacked by workers
for opposition parties.
   ``We have no savings. We suffer that day,'' he said.
   Ghafoor said he saw little hope that the election, which Ershad
called in a move to compromise with the opposition, would lead to
such a compromise.
   ``How can I think that any of these people care about us?'' he
asked. ``No leader has done anything for the poor.''
   Politicians and diplomats, who talked about the election results
on the basis of anonymity, had more sophisticated judgments on the
likelihood of a compromise. But they also expressed doubts one
could be achieved.
   Ershad, a former general who took power in a bloodless coup in
1982, still has strong backing from the army, meaning another coup
soon seems unlikely. In Bangladesh, a military takeover is always a
possibility since every change in government in the country's 17
years of independence has been achieved by coup.
   The opposition, which claims Ershad's 1986 election as president
resulted from vote rigging, has failed to unseat the 58-year-old
Ershad despite the violent general strikes that led to at least 25
deaths.
   Stepping up the violence could prompt Ershad to reimpose the
martial law in effect from 1982 to 1986 or could anger the public
by devastating the economy.

   Westerners in Lhasa today said security
forces had withdrawn from around the Tibetan capital's main temple,
where monks led a violent weekend protest that Beijing said left
hundreds of police injured.
   In the fullest official account yet of the rioting against
Chinese rule, the Chinese News Service today said more than 300
police were injured in the rioting Saturday and Sunday in Lhasa.
Previous official reports had said that one policeman was killed
and 28 injured in a single day of rioting.
   The fighting occurred in Lhasa at the Jokhang, Tibet's holiest
temple.
   One Westerner in Lhasa, a Tibetan-speaking traveler, said
Tibetans told him five Tibetans and three Chinese police were
killed in daylong violence Saturday, the last day of a major prayer
festival.
   Another traveler, who arrived today Chengdu, 750 miles east of
Lhasa, said officials told him two people were killed _ a Chinese
policeman who was pushed off a roof and a Tibetan. Both travelers
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The China News Service said 30 police officers were hospitalized
with serious injuries and ``numerous'' civilians were hurt in the
violence _ the second nationalist riots in Lhasa since October.
   In an eyewitness report seen in Hong Kong, the agency claimed
the disturbances were plotted by unidentified Tibetans who had bags
of rocks placed on top of buildings around the central Barkhor
marketplace. It said Buddhist monks on Saturday poisoned tea given
to officials and journalists, who had to be hospitalized. The
report did not elaborate on their condition.
   During the rioting, local government and Communist Party
officials were forced to slide down ropes from a second-story
office in the Jokhang to escape enraged monks, said the account by
reporter Geng Jun. He said the officials slid to safety just before
the monks broke down the office door.
   The report said ``some rioters set up barricades in Barkhor
marketplace on Sunday morning and indiscriminately threw stones
that injured numerous city residents.''
   ``One monk stood up and started shouting for independence and he
was arrested,'' the Western traveler in Lhasa said by telephone.
``The monks started throwing stones. The crowd just ran.''
   He said authorities hustled him and other foreigners to their
hotels. But when he left his room a few hours later to get food, he
encountered a clash in the square in front of the Johkang.
   ``I found myself in the middle of a skirmish. Some tear gas went
off near me. Twenty to 30 Tibetans were throwing stones at Chinese
soliders and the Chinese soldiers were throwing stones back.''
   The traveler said the Chinese did not open fire. ``In that
sense, the Chinese were showing a lot of restraint.''
   There have been no official figures given on arrests, but
unconfirmed reports have said hundreds were rounded up.
   Westerners in Lhasa said Johkang remained closed today but
police on Monday stopped blocking entry to the Barkhor market
square. They said uniformed police had been replaced by dozens of
plainclothes officers who closely followed the few foreign tourists
in town and would not allow them to take pictures.
   William Tang, assistant foreign manager at the Lhasa Hotel, said
guests were being told they could go to the square but ``at their
own risk.''
   The violence was the first in Lhasa since Oct. 1, when 2,000
Tibetans led by monks burned down a police station facing Jokhang
Temple. Police opened fire, and at least 14 people were killed in
the battle.
   The Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader China blames for
instigating the riots, issued a statement from his office in New
Delhi on Monday saying ``the courage of the Tibetan people in
expressing, once again, their dissatisfaction against Chinese rule
in spite of the obvious risk involved clearly reveal their
desperation.''
   The Dalai Lama, who fled following a failed uprising in 1959,
also called on Tibetans to ``restrain from violence.''
   China says Tibet has been part of the nation for centuries, and
claims it is making amends for past polices that suppressed Tibetan
customs and religion and destroyed many of their temples.
   Antagonisms remain strong, however, between the Tibetans and the
Hans, China's ethnic majority who hold most of the top government
posts in Lhasa.
   The Western traveler said Tibetans told him police beat two
monks to death inside the Jokhang. Several Tibetans later carried
the monks' bodies around the square, he said, triggering further
clashes.

<HEAD>Scriptwriters Vow to Continue Walkout</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Television and movie producers scrambled to
hire replacement scriptwriters and urged strikers to cross picket
lines today in an effort to keep Hollywood game shows and soap
operas on the air.
   But the scriptwriters vowed to wait out the struggle as nearly
2,000 of them marched five abreast in front of 20th Century Fox
studios Monday, the first day of a walkout over demands for higher
fees and more creative control.
   ``Hollywood has treated writers like bean-field workers for
years,'' said screenwriter and science-fiction author Harlan
Ellison. ``It begins with the dream. Without the dream on paper
there is nothing.''
   The Writers Guild of America rejected Sunday's final offer by
the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers and a
strike was ordered for 9,000 members.
   The WGA strike is the fourth since a 17-week walkout in 1973.
The longest, in 1981, lasted three months.
   Nick Counter, the alliance's president and chief negotiator,
predicted the walkout may be a long one. ``It's the same kind of
feeling as we had in 1981,'' he said. ``This could go on even
longer than that.''
   Issues include demands by writers for a higher percentage of
foreign market distribution fees and more control over scripts, and
a producers' demand to scale back syndication fees for one-hour
television shows. Producers say new shows made for independent
stations have dried up the rerun syndication market.
   For some pickets like James L. Brooks, whose writing credits
include the films ``Broadcast News'' and ``Terms of Endearment''
and television's ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' a key battle was
for creative control.
   ``If you take creative rights from enough different groups, you
end up without a creation, you end up with something else. You end
up with an exercise in marketing,'' Brooks said.
   Counter said producers may begin hiring temporary replacements
for striking writers until a settlement is reached.
   ``Our companies are encouraging whoever wants to come forward to
write these scripts,'' he said, urging union and non-union writers
to cross picket lines.
   Counter said non-guild writers were being sought to avoid having
soap operas and game shows go to reruns. The union said talk shows
also would be among the first to suffer from the walkout.
   However, spokespersons for CBS and NBC said soap operas such as
``Days of Our Lives,'' ``As the World Turns,'' and ``The Young and
the Restless'' shouldn't be affected soon because of stockpiled
scripts.
   ``It's business as usual. We're prepared,'' CBS spokeswoman
Janet Storm said.
   NBC's ``Late Night With David Letterman'' and ``Saturday Night
Live,'' already were on scheduled breaks this week. ``The Tonight
Show With Johnny Carson'' on Monday featured guest host Jay Leno,
who used material prepared before the strike.
   The guild's contract expired Feb. 29. The median annual income
for writers is $40,000, but about half of the WGA's members are
unemployed at any given time.

   Israelis who spent nearly an hour on a bus with
three armed guerrillas said they tried to stay calm, even offering
one captor some milk, but finally became convinced ``we're not
getting out of this alive.''
   One wrote a final note to her three children. Another laid down
and thought: ``That's it, goodbye.''
   Three Israelis _ two women and a man _ were killed Monday during
the incident in southern Israel along with the three PLO guerrillas.
   The bus' other eight passengers, workers on the way to their
jobs at the Dimona nuclear plant, were all injured during the
ordeal.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization claimed responsibility for
the attack. The army said the guerrillas infiltrated from Egypt.
   While Israeli officials were negotiating with the three
guerrillas to try to end the standoff, ``we tried to create a calm
atmosphere,'' Stella Bechar, 46, who was hospitalized with multiple
shrapnel and gunshot wounds, told the daily Jerusalem Post. ``Each
one had a gun, a Kalashnikov, ready to shoot.''
   Some of the Israelis aboard the bus spoke some Arabic.
   ``I asked one (of the guerrillas) if he wanted some milk because
he said he was thirsty,'' Mrs. Bechar said. ``We even tried to joke
with each other, and we told each other that there is a God and we
would get out of this alive.''
   As negotiations continued, said fellow hostage Daisy Sorek,
``the terrorists were getting more and more impatient'' and
threatened to kill a hostage every half hour if a Red Cross
negotiator was not summoned.
   ``At one point he (one of the guerrillas) got a megaphone and
became very, very agitated. He said, over and over in Arabic,
``every half-hour, one,'' Mrs. Sorek said.
   The leader of the gang then called one passenger, Victor Ram,
and ordered him to stand at the front of the bus, Sorek told the
Post.
   ``Then they shot him in the chest and he just fell, immediately.
And then we knew: we're not getting out of this alive,'' she said.
``They seemed very confused. After they shot Ram, the commander's
gun didn't work anymore. Something was wrong with it.''
   ``I told them `It's such a shame, you're so young. You don't
have to do this,''' Rachel Matza, who was recovering from surgery
to remove shrapnel, told the Post. ``But they said `No, we're going
to die and we're going to blow you up with us.' ... We felt we were
dead women.''
   Mrs. Bechar remembers little of the rescue operation except
laying down next to a pile of purses that the guerrillas had
searched through.
   ``I remembered that on television they always say it's a good
idea to lie down,'' she said. ``Then I closed my eyes and I
remember thinking, `That's it, goodbye.'''
   Mrs. Sorek said while she was held on the bus she wrote a note
to her three children. ``I wrote to them to ask the government to
speed matters along between Jews and Arabs, to do something,'' she
said.
   ``Only with a peace agreement are we going to get anywhere.''

<HEAD>DEA Agents Reportedly Traveling With Bolivia Forces</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Specially trained U.S. drug agents are
venturing into the Bolivian jungle with local forces in a program
that targets drug trafficking and may soon be expanded to other
countries, a federal official said.
   The program, which began last year, is reportedly the first
putting U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents alongside local
forces in South American countryside. The agents work in an
advisory capacity, The San Diego Union reported today.
   The assistance was requested by Bolivia and will be expanded
into five other South American countries that have also requested
the service, DEA chief John Lawn told the newspaper. He refused to
identify the other countries.
   ``This is a significant step for DEA because we have countries
seeking the kind of assistance that we want to provide,'' Lawn
said. ``We believe this operation will have an impact in the U.S.
and European cocaine market.''
   U.S. drug agents previously have concentrated their anti-drug
efforts in the region's urban areas, but agents sometimes worked in
undercover at a host country's request, Lawn said.
   Under the program, volunteer U.S. drug agents undergo a
three-month training program that includes a weapons course at the
Marine training base at Quantico, Va., a language program, and a
jungle survival school led by the U.S. Army Special Forces in
Panama, he said.
   The first graduates were sent to Bolivia last fall.
   Some U.S. agents trained in the program were involved in the
tracking down of two major Bolivian cocaine labs two months ago,
Lawn said. Twelve suspects were indicted on drug trafficking
conspiracy charges as a result of that investigation.
   In addition, Bolivian pilots are using U.S. helicopters to find
and disrupt the drying of coca leaves.

   Mercedes-Benz of North America has announced its
fourth price increase since March 1987 because of the continuing
weakness of the dollar against the West German mark.
   Mercedes said Monday prices on nine of its 13 models will
increase an average 1.6 percent on cars delivered to dealers
starting April 18.
   The three least expensive Mercedes models, the 190Es, will not
be affected by the increases, which will boost the price of the
next model, the 260 E sedan, to $37,845 from $37,250.
   At the other extreme, the price of 560SEC will jump to $77,065
from $75,850, said Mercedes spokesman A.B. Shuman.

<HEAD>Iran, Iraq Resume Missile Attacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMIR F. GHATTAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran and Iraq today fired more missiles
at each other's capitals, and Iran accused the United States and
France of helping Iraq refit Soviet-designed missiles to give them
enough range to hit Tehran.
   The charge was made by Iranian Parliament Speaker Hashemi
Rafsanjani.
   Before the latest round of the so-called ``war of the cities''
began Feb. 29, Iraq had been unable to hit Tehran with
surface-to-surface missiles because the city is nearly 300 miles
from the Iraqi border.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported that an
Iraqi missile crashed into a residential neighborhood of Tehran
early today, killing or wounding ``several'' civilians and damaging
a church.
   State-run Baghdad Radio reported that Iraqi gunners fired the
missile into Tehran, a city of 6 million people, less than an hour
after Iran claimed it had lobbed a projectile into Baghdad.
   Iraq's news agency confirmed the latest Iranian missile strike
on a residential area in Baghdad, saying civilians, including
women, children and eldery people, were killed. No figures were
given.
   IRNA also said Revolutionary Guards today shot a missile at a
``military center'' at Amarah, an Iraqi town close to the border
and halfway between Baghdad and the southern port city of Basra.
   Iraqi statements made no mention of the Amarah strike.
   The reports were monitored in Nicosia.
   Iraq said it fired three missiles into Tehran on Monday, and
Iran reported its Revolutionary Guards blasted Baghdad with four
missiles and launched a fifth at the northern city of Mosul for the
first time.
   Iraq confirmed only two missiles crashed Monday in Baghdad, a
city of 5 million, killing or wounding ``many civilians, including
women and children.''
   Iraq says it has fired 42 projectiles into Tehran since the
missile duel began when Iran sent two missiles crashing into
Baghdad in retaliation for an earlier Iraqi air raid on the Tehran
oil refinery.
   Iraq also has fired three missiles at the holy city of Qom, seat
of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's religious hierarchy.
   The Iranians have reported more than 30 missiles have hit
Tehran. They said Revolutionary Guards fired 25 long-range missiles
on Iraq during that period, 23 of them on Baghdad. The Iraqis have
only acknowledged 19 hits on the capital and one on Mosul.
   Both sides reported air raids on each other's cities and
artillery bombardment of border towns on Monday.
   IRNA said 30 civilians were killed and more than 100 people
wounded in Monday's Iraqi missile attacks on Tehran's residential
areas. It reported one missile demolished a clinic, a school and
several houses.
   Iran has listed at least 122 civilians killed and more than 300
wounded in the Iraqi missile blitz, with more than 100 killed and
more than 500 wounded in air raids over the last week. The Iraqis
have reported heavy civilian casualties, but gave no exact figures.
   Rafsanjani, Khomeini's representative on the Supreme Defense
Council which directs war policy, said Iranian experts who examined
several unexploded missiles confirmed the projectiles were Soviet
Scud-Bs, Tehran radio reported.
   ``It became clear that although the missile is made in Russia,
most of the Eastern (bloc) countries manufacture or assemble this
missile today, and Iraq can obtain it from other sources,'' he said
in an interview on the radio.
   Iran last week accused Moscow of supplying Iraq with the
missiles, triggering several violent protests outside the Soviet
Embassy in Tehran and the consulate-general in the central city of
Isfahan. The Soviet Union who, along with France, is main arms
supplier of Iraq, denied the charge.
   Iraq said the missile used, named ``Al Hussein'' after a 7th
century Shiite Moslem saint, was of its own design and production.
   However, western military analysts believe the missiles were
Scud-Bs, fitted with the help of North Korean experts with strap-on
boosters to give the projectile enough range to reach Tehran.
   But Rafsanjani said the missiles fired at Tehran were Scud-Bs
that ``have been clumsily tampered with'' in order to increase
their range. The Scud normally has a range of 190 miles.
   ``Of course, not the Iraqis themselves, for the Iraqis are
incapable of even tampering with these missiles. No doubt, the
major powers did this. Such powers as the Americans and France,''
he said.

<DATELINE>KINGSTON, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators searching for the cattle
rustlers who stole 25 cows from a western Illinois farm know they
aren't dealing with amateurs.
   Of the 80 cows at Two Rivers Farm, the thieves took only the
ones that were pregnant.
   ``All had been bred and were ready to calve, some of them within
24 hours,'' state police Sgt. Mike Ernst said Monday.
   ``It would have had to have been somebody familiar with cattle.''
   The cows were stolen late Saturday or early Sunday from a
holding barn 2 miles north of Kingston, Ernst said.
   ``It's in a pretty secluded area,'' he said. ``There's no house
and no house in sight. The nearest house is a half mile away.''
   The mixed-breed cows, which Two Rivers was feeding and housing
for their owners, are more valuable because they are pregnant,
Ernst said.
   ``A calf would be worth at least $150 by itself,'' he said
   Investigators have few leads, Ernst said. There are indications
that a truck was used to haul the cows away, police said.
   The thieves also took a motorcycle, a welder, a saddle, tools
and several bags of orchard grass and clover seed, police said. The
loss of the animals and equipment was valued at $30,000, Ernst said.

<HEAD>Men Backing Noriega Use Land Rover To Seize Consulate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panamanian Embassy workers and private security
men used a Land Rover to smash into and seize the Panamanian
Consulate, whose top diplomat had remained loyal to deposed
President Eric Arturo Delvalle.
   Police said they believed the six assailants, including two
representatives of Panamanian Ambassador Guillermo Vega, entered
the building Monday night after using the jeep to break through its
reinforced plate glass door.
   The consul, Eduardo Arango, had refused to give up his post
despite being fired for still recognizing Delvalle.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. said the consulate staff had also
remained loyal to Delvalle, who was ousted Feb. 26 after trying to
dismiss Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, Panama's military leader and
de facto ruler.
   Control of Panama's Embassy in Washington is also in dispute.
   The Reagan administration has been trying to force Noriega to
step down since the general was indicted on federal drug
trafficking charges in Florida last month.
   The Land Rover, driven by one of the British security men,
mounted the sidewalk, smashed through the door into the lobby of
the consulate, which is about a mile from the Panamanian Embassy.
   ``Shortly after this several people left the building, including
three women believed to be secretaries, and a number of security
staff. One glass-paneled front door was damaged. No one was
injured,'' police said in a statement.
   Arango was at his London home at the time and was told about it
by one of the consulate staff.
   One consular official who was forced out, Tourism Commissioner
Rolando Domingo, 24, said: ``We were just working in there and then
suddenly we heard a crash.'' He said the jeep came through the
glass door and then a group of men entered the building carrying
large hammers.
   ``They threatened us with hammers and one tried to hit my face.
They took my passport and documents. Then they pushed me down the
stairs and out of the building,'' Domingo said.
   Police sealed off the area around the consulate in Tudor Street
in the City, London's financial district.
   Police said they entered the consulate after negotiations with
Panamanian government representatives they did not identify, and
left the building in the control of the ambassador and his security
staff.
   Arango, in a BBC interview, condemned the forced entry as ``a
thuggish way of behaving and an unbelievable way of doing things in
a civilized country.''
   He was quoted by the British domestic news agency Press
Association as saying he was prevented from entering the consulate
after the seizure and that one of the men involved told him they
were working for Vega and carrying out orders from Panama.
   The agency also quoted Arango as saying he had received letters
from Panama saying he was dismissed but ignored them. British
government officials said they were told on Friday that Arango was
being fired as consul.
   The BBC said Arango was in Panama at the time of Delvalle's
ouster and has said he helped smuggle Delvalle from his residence
to a hiding place in the Central American country.
   Arango said he would protest to the British Foreign Office and
said the British driver of the Land Rover ought to be prosecuted.
   The security guards involved work for GB Security, a private
company based at Sutton in south London.
   A spokesman at the British Foreign Office, who in accordance
with British practice declined to be named, said it was too early
to say what action, if any, Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe
might take over the incident.

   Poufs, ruffles, frills and furbelows are
banished from the fashion scene, say the cream of Italy's designers
showing their fall-winter collections in Milan.
   Coming on strong is a cool, calm and collected look that is both
elongated and elegant. Pants play a major role in preference to
last season's mini skirts.
   The new, haughty look is one which is right up Gianfranco
Ferre's alley. He has always designed with a high-stepping female
in mind rather than a romantic heroine.
   In his show Monday, the dramatic shirts that are his signature
had important, stiffly up-standing collars that jutted forward into
crumb-catcher folds.
   Actress Ali McGraw, who was a guest at the show, said: ``I love
them.''
   Slim pants in smooth wools or crushed velvet provided the
perfect accompaniment to these important shirts.
   Ferre's color choice, in scarlet, black and white, was as
forceful as his fashion statement. He even dyed beaver fur scarlet
for blouses and detachable cuff collars that trimmed coats and
jackets.
   But one red touch he could have done without was the scarlet
eyeshadow daubed on the models' eyelids.
   Big winter coats were cut slim and straight and almost brushed
the ankles. Jackets that were neat and short and minus collars were
wrapped up in matching wool stoles.
   And he had lots of little foxes running down the runway in a
variety of guises, spiralling round sleeves, forming skirts and
curling round necks and hemlines.
   Evenings were largely based on black, looking good on
long-length smartly tailored redingotes that flared into fullness
from a lowered waistline. White lace kerchiefs _ another McGraw
favorite _ spilling from collars and cuffs gave a dandified look.
   Earlier on Monday, leather fashions specialist, Mario Valentino,
was another pants fan but with a difference. He cut them newly
wide-legged and floppy, stemming from a high waistline, in supple
suede.
   Accompanying jackets were also loose and boxy. He took the
padding out of shoulders on a handsome coat in calf that flared out
to its near floor-length hemline.
   And he struck a blow for the return to the straight and narrow
with his super-slender suit comprising a trim little jacket and
pencil-slim, calf-length skirt in glossy leather. Aviators' jackets
and top coats in dark chocolatae brown were treated to fur linings.
   With Ferre and Versace now both creating couture fashions in
addition to their lines of deluxe ready-made styles, there is news
that the fashion house of Andre Laug, which showed in Milan Sunday,
has also reversed its decision to no longer make clothes for
private clients.
   This house, famed for its superb sartorial skills, suspended the
custom-made side of the business for a brief period but now intends
to reinstate it.
   Couture provides a fashion house with allure and gives
invaluable promotional power that can aid other activities
belonging to the same establishment.
   Milan shows swing into their third day today. Highlights are to
include the fabulous furs of the famed Fendi family.

   Everywhere Evan L. Mecham goes, people ask
him about his political and legal problems. He tells them he has
none.
   Evan L. Mecham is not the governor of Arizona. He is not facing
impeachment, a recall election or a trial in Superior Court.
   He lives in Denver, owns a liquor distributorship, and in his
travels around the country is constantly telling people, ``No, no,
no, I'm not THAT Evan Mecham.''
   When he first heard that Arizona's Mecham had been elected
governor in November 1986, Colorado's Mecham said he was encouraged.
   ``Well, you would hope some good would come of it,'' said
Mecham, 38. ``I'd hate to run for public office now. My political
aspirations would have to be put on the back burner.''
   To say that he takes the notoriety in stride is an
understatement. A call to his home phone gets the recorded voice of
his daughter, Tiffany, 11.
   ``If you're trying to reach Governor Evan Mecham, you have the
wrong number,'' the recording says. ``However, if you have a
campaign contribution of $300,000 or more and wish to keep it
confidential, please leave your name and number and we'll get back
to you. Thank you for your support.''

   The demolition of the 16-story Travelers Insurance
building provided some surprises for its downtown neighbors. One
was a phenomenon little seen by city dwellers: sunlight.
   A restaurant manager directly across from the rubble-filled site
in Boston's financial district jokingly complained Monday that
light now beats through his floor-to-ceiling windows without the
skyscraper to block it out.
   ``They should start issuing sunglasses to the employees,'' said
manager Frank Strangie, manager of Sandwich Expressions.
   But others in the area weren't amused by the dusty windows,
dirty floors and shattered glass resulting from Sunday's demolition.
   ``There was a little bit more broken glass than we had
expected,'' said Bill Ramsey of Control Demolitions Inc., which
conducted the blast that caused the building to implode, or
collapse inward.
   Up to two dozen windows at Strangie's building were shattered,
said its manager, David Ham.
   ``The whole building is filthy, we have to have it washed
down,'' Strangie said.
   The demolition company has agreed to pay for the cost of
replacing the panes but plans to look at clean-up costs on a
case-by-case basis, Ramsey said.

<TEXT>
   The weather seemed springlike across much of the nation early
today, with mild temperatures and rainshowers common.
   But on Monday, a severe thunderstorm struck north-central Texas,
producing hail an inch in diameter in some places. Lightning
sparked numerous grass fires.
   Milder, springlike thunderstorms developed across parts of
northern Texas and Oklahoma, while showers extended across western
Missouri, western Iowa, parts of Kansas, northwest Oklahoma, the
Texas Panhandle, western Louisiana and southeast Texas. Light rain
covered much of southern Minnesota, Wisconsin and parts of lower
Michigan.
   Rain mixed with sleet and wet snow fell in northern Wisconsin,
while snowfall in the northern Plains diminished late Monday. Some
light snow extended from western Nebraska across parts of the
Dakotas to northern Minnesota. An inch of wet snow was reported at
Duluth, Minn., early today.
   Windy conditions covered portions of the northern and central
high Plains. Winds gusted to between 40 and 50 mph throughout
Monday evening and early today at Rapid City, S.D.
   Other than scattered light rain in western Washington, the
western third of the nation was dry, as was the East Coast and much
of the Southeast.
   Mild temperatures prevailed over much of the nation, and even
the colder air in the Rockies and northern Plains lacked a wintry
punch.
   The high for the nation Monday was 88 at Thermal, Calif.
   The forecast for today called for showers and thunderstorms from
southern and eastern Texas across eastern Oklahoma to the lower and
middle Mississippi Valley; scattered showers from lower Michigan to
Alabama late in the day; rain or snow from northeast New Mexico and
northwest Texas to upper Michigan, with snow likely over Minnesota
and the eastern Dakotas; sunny skies over the Atlantic Coast states
and west of the Rockies, except for light rain spreading into
western Washington state; strong winds over south Texas and the
northern high Plains.
   Much the nation is expected to have highs in the 50s or 60s.
Highs will be in the 30s and 40s from the central Rockies across
the central and northern Plains, from the upper Mississippi Valley
to upper Michigan, and from upstate New York to northern and
central New England; 40s from northern New Mexico to central
Oklahoma; and 70s and lower 80s in California, the desert Southwest
and from southern Texas to the southern Atlantic Coast.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from zero at
Yellowstone, Wyo., to 73 at Key West, Fla.

<TEXT>
   The Justice Department has given permission
to unaffiliated voters to cast ballots in the North Carolina
Republican presidential primary, according to state GOP Chairman
Jack Hawke.
   The last-minute ruling clears up confusion that arose last week
when a department official said the state party had failed to
obtain necessary clearance to open its primaries to independents.
   The department said its decision applied only to today's
presidential primary and that the state Republican Party would have
to submit another request for the policy to receive permanent
approval.
   ``We have constantly tried to show that we're a party with an
open door and want people to join us ... and this is just another
step,'' Hawke said at a news conference.
   Hawke declined to predict how many unaffiliated voters would
take advantage of the opportunity or which of the four Republican
presidential hopefuls stood to benefit most from the new policy.

<HEAD>Most Washington State Voters Would Replace Caucus With Primary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly half of Washington state's voters would
prefer to replace the state's existing caucus system with a
presidential primary election, a poll says.
   The sample of 500 registered voters found 48 percent preferred a
primary, 27 percent want to stick with the caucus system and 25
percent with no preference between the two options.
   The poll, conducted Feb. 24-27 for The Seattle Times, had a
margin of error of 5 percent.
   The preference for a primary election was stronger among
Democrats than Republicans and stronger among men than women, the
poll found.
   The caucus method is ``just a good-ol'-boy system,'' said Oliver
Smith, 55, a Renton elementary school teacher. ``I've had friends
that have gone to the caucuses and they weren't given the time of
day unless they were insiders.''
   But Barbara Clark, a mental health therapist from Bainbridge
Island, favored the caucuses.
   ``It gives people a chance to come out and debate things face to
face,'' she said. ``That's more than you get in a primary.''
   The idea of a presidential primary has been introduced
repeatedly in the state Legislature, with no success.

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis planned to vote in a Boston suburb today, after frenetic
campaigning that included a Super Tuesday endorsement from South
Florida's elderly ``condo boss.''
   Dukakis was picked from among the Democratic contenders who
courted Annie Ackerman, a 74-year-old former Chicago ward organizer
who has a knack for getting out the vote among this area's vast
retirement community.
   ``You have come out to listen to the man who will be the next
president of the United States,'' Mrs. Ackerman told about 500
senior citizens at Point East condominiums Monday. She spoke of
Dukakis' immigrant roots, something he had in common with many of
those at the rally.
   ``My mother would have said he's a mensch,'' Mrs. Ackerman said,
referring to the Yiddish word for good man. ``He's a person of
integrity who gets things done.''
   Dukakis planned to vote this morning, spend a quiet day at his
Statehouse office and then fly to Chicago to begin campaigning for
the Illinois primary.

   MILAN, Italy _ A malfunctioning heater and a broken humidifier
at a museum damaged about 20 Renaissance paintings, including works
by Piero della Francesca, Italian media reported.
   The heater malfunction at the Brera Gallery allowed the
temperatures in recent days to rise to 75 degrees, well above the
normal 55-57 degrees, news agencies and newspapers reported over
the weekend.
   The museum said in addition to works by della Francesca were
``The Redeemer'' by Giovanni Bellini, ``Madonna With Child'' by

   The winner of a $21 million Ohio Lottery prize
said he doesn't feel any richer yet, and he hopes the money won't
change his family life.
   Richard Couchot, 49, of Ashland, Ky., turned in his winning
ticket for validation Monday at the lottery's Columbus office,
lottery spokeswoman Anne Bloomberg said.
   She confirmed that Couchet won Wednesday's ``Super Lotto''
drawing and will receive $21 million in 20 annual payments of $1.05
million, or $840,000 after federal withholding tax.
   ``I hope that we use the money wisely and that it doesn't change
our friends and our children,'' Couchot said in a telephone
interview late Monday before flying here for a news conference.
   ``Money shouldn't change your life,'' he said. ``We're very rich
right now. It's been tough putting three kids through college and
we've got one more to go.''
   He said he was calm after learning that he won the lottery prize.
   ``I don't have any more today than yesterday,'' he said. ``The
reaction may come after you receive the money.''
   His wife, Katharine, said: ``It's hard to believe. For five days
I've been weak and trembling. I can hardly believe it.''
   Mrs. Couchot, 48, said her husband is vice president of Ashland
Financial Services and plans to continue working at least until a
replacement is found.
   Mrs. Couchot said she and her husband grew up in Piqua, near
Dayton, Ohio, but have lived in Ashland, just across the Ohio River
from southeastern Ohio, for about 18 years.
   The Couchots are the second biggest winners of the Ohio Lottery
after an Indiana couple who won $25 million with one ticket in
April 1986.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newly united opposition called for
the removal of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and the formation of a
transitional government, while pro-Noriega diplomats seized
Panama's London consulate from rivals.
   The nation's banks were shuttered for a fifth day on Monday.
Outside, retired people unable to cash pension checks blocked
traffic and shouted ``Where's my money!''
   In another development, a U.S. judge extended a freeze on
Panamanian government funds in American banks.
   Opposition organizations and ousted president Eric Arturo
Delvalle joined forces after 10 days of turmoil triggered by
Delvalle's attempt to fire Noriega and the resulting dismissal of
the president, who remains in hiding.
   Virtually all the nation's civilian political forces not
directly linked to the armed forces or to the Noriega regime joined
in the alliance.
   In London Monday night, Panamanian Embassy workers and private
security men used a Land Rover to smash into and seize the
consulate, whose top diplomat had remained loyal to Delvalle.
   Police reported no injuries, though some consulate workers said
they were threatened with hammers, and left the building in control
of Panamanian Ambassador Guillermo Vega.
   Consul Eduardo Arango acknowledged he had been fired for
remaining loyal to Delvalle, who the United States still considers
Panama's president.
   In a declaration issued in Panama Monday, the opposition
alliance said ``our principal objective'' is ``the establishment of
a government of national reconciliation that guarantees justice, a
state of law, liberty, reconstruction of democratic institutions,
fiscal order, economic development, conditions for authentic
democracy and the celebration of free, open and honest elections.''
   Elections are scheduled for May 1989.
   Among those signing the document were Arnulfo Arias of the
Panamanian Authentic Party, the country's largest opposition party.
Arias has been president three times and was ousted by the military
each time. His supporters claimed he was robbed of victory in the
1984 election.
   Also signing were representatives of the two other opposition
parties and the National Civic Crusade, an alliance of 200
professional, business, labor and political organizations that has
led anti-Noriega protests since June.
   The declaration recognizes Delvalle ``as he who now exercises
the office of president.'' It praised his attempt to fire Noriega
Feb. 25, saying he ``demonstrated he has committed himself to the
changes necessary for establishment of a legitimate democracy.''
   Delvalle moved up from the vice presidency when the military
pressured then-president Nicolas Ardito Barletta, who was declared
winner in the 1984 election, to resign in September 1985.
   The alliance said a national reconciliation government would
include ``representatives of political parties and other forces
dedicated to the reestablishment in Panama of a democratic order.''
   It said the government ``will pursue an understanding with the
Defense Forces in order to define their legitimate function.''
   With the declaration, Delvalle and his vice president, Roderick
Esquivel, who also was deposed, issued a statement calling for
respect for individual rights, subordination of the military to
civilian authority, the naming of a new Cabinet, a new Supreme
Court and new electoral magistrates.
   The Reagan administration has called for Noriega's ouster since
he was indicted in Florida in February on federal drug trafficking
charges.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater on Monday
said the Reagan administration was considering economic and trade
sanctions against Panama, including withholding monthly payments
for the Panama Canal and putting the money into escrow.
   On March 15, the United States is due to pay $6.5 million to the
Panama Canal Commission, a monthly installment on the $75 million
to $80 million Washington provides Panama each year under the canal
treaty.
   The Panama Canal Commission spokeswoman, Willie Friar, Monday
denied media reports that port authorities were requiring cash
payments from ships traveling through the canal. She said the flow
of traffic was ``completely normal.''
   In New York, U.S. District Judge Lloyd F. MacMahon on Monday
extended for 10 days a temporary restraining order issued Thursday
preventing two U.S. banks from transferring an estimated $50
million to the National Bank of Panama.
   Panama uses the U.S. dollar for its currency and calls it the
balboa. The government periodically receives tender from the U.S.
banks where it keeps an estimated $50 million on deposit.
   A request for such a transfer last week was denied because of
legal action, backed by Washington, taken on behalf of Delvalle.
   Local banks in Panama closed last week, fearing a run on
deposits because of political instability. On Friday, foreign banks
also closed, and businesses stopped taking checks or credit cards.
   The government promised to set up payment centers for the
country's 60,000 pensioners, but they were not in operation Monday
whem most picked social security checks for the first two weeks of
March, ranging from $60 to $250.

   A fisherman died after a gar fish
jumped out of the water and cut his neck, a newspaper reported
today.
   The fish, a forktail alligator gar, struck fisherman Anthony
Fernando, 21, Monday night, the Sun newspaper reported. He died
before fellow fishermen could get him to a hospital, the paper said.
   The paper quoted his brother, Nisantha, as saying the incident
occurred off the southwestern coast of the island. He speculated
that the fish, one of a number jumping in the water at the time,
had been attracted by a light on their boat.

<TEXT>
   A woman who ambushed and shot her former
psychologist, his wife and young daughter after harassing them for
years pleaded guilty to attempted murder and assault and faces a
mandatory life prison term.
   Kimberly A. Gracyalny, 30, entered her plea Monday before
Municipal Court Judge David M. Horwitz.
   Ms. Gracyalny began harassing David Fox, a neuro-psychology
specialist, and his family soon after he treated her between
November 1982 and March 1983 for an undisclosed problem,
authorities said.
   On Dec. 20, Ms. Gracyalny hid in the front yard of the family's
suburban home and opened fire with a handgun as they returned from
dinner, chasing them around the house to the back yard before the
couple was able to subdue her.
   The attack left Fox, 34, shot in the arm, his wife Deborah, 31,
shot in both legs, and their 6-year-old daughter shot in the left
leg. Three sons, ages 9, 10, and 18 months, were unharmed.
   Under the terms of a plea bargain, Ms. Gracyalny pleaded guilty
to one count of premeditated attempted murder, which carries the
mandatory life term, and two counts of assault. Five additional
premeditated attempted murder counts are to be dropped at the April
5 sentencing.
   In 1986, the psychologist obtained a Superior Court restraining
order against Ms. Gracyalny after she allegedly stalked the family,
made threatening phone calls and trespassed on their property,
sometimes shooting off flashbulbs in front of their windows.

<TEXT>
   The dollar fell against nearly all major
currencies in active European trading early today, partly depressed
by a surge in the British pound, dealers said. Gold bullion also
fell.
   Dealers said investors continued to focus on the pound, selling
large amounts of dollars for pounds for a second straight day. They
said it became clear Monday that the Bank of England had not
intervened with substantial sales of pounds to rein in the currency.
   The pound was boosted by strong economic growth and relatively
high interest rates in Britain, dealers said. Sterling rose to
$1.8270 from $1.8135 late Monday, more than 5 cents higher than
Monday's opening.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before it begins in Europe, the
dollar fell to a closing 127.80 Japanese yen from 128.87 yen at
Monday's close. But later in London, the dollar edged back up to
128.35 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Monday:
   _1.6755 West German marks, down from 1.6765
   _1.3825 Swiss francs, down from 1.3870
   _5.6730 French francs, down from 5.6880
   _1.8790 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8840
   _1,236.75 Italian lire, down from 1,239.75
   _1.2542 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2562
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $435.60 a troy ounce,
down from $437.20 bid late Monday. At mid-morning today, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $435.70.
   In Zurich, the noon bid price was $435.60, down from $436 late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell to a closing bid of $438.00,
down from $438.75 late Monday.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a bid price of $6.38 a troy
ounce, down from $6.42 late Monday.

<TEXT>
   The murder trial of a jobless handyman
accused of killing seven women in his apartment and leaving their
bodies to rot moved quickly into testimony after the defendant
waived his right to a jury trial.
   The defense and prosecution also declined to give opening
statements Monday in the case of Harrison ``Marty'' Graham.
   Graham, 28, waived a trial by jury as a panel waited to be
interviewed, then pleaded innocent to seven counts each of murder,
involuntary manslaughter and abuse of a corpse.
   ``He and his mother agreed that a judge would be more objective
than a jury,'' Graham's attorney, Joel Moldovsky, said after the
court session. The move is also expected to shorten a trial that
had been expected to last up to three months.
   Assistant District Attorney Roger King moved for admission of
all testimony and documents from a monthlong pretrial suppression
hearing, including a confession Graham made to police in which he
admitted strangling the seven women during sex. Common Pleas Judge
Robert Latrone granted the request.
   During the pretrial hearing, Moldovsky, contending his client is
mentally incompetent, sought unsuccessfully to suppress the
confession.
   Moldovsky said the confession was made in violation of his
client's constitutional rights and after Graham allegedly was
beaten by police during 17 hours of interrogation. Latrone ruled
last week the confession was voluntary and that Graham was
competent to stand trial.
   The first witness called by the prosecution, acting city Medical
Examiner Robert Catherman, testified that all seven deaths were
homicides. However, the cause of death, due to the condition of the
bodies, was undetermined, he said.
   Graham turned himself in a week after police discovered rotting
bodies in his bedroom and leg and foot bones on the roof of the
house in a Philadelphia neighborhood notorious for drug dealing.
   In the confession Graham told police the bodies began piling up
in his bedroom, and he began having problems with maggots. He also
told of difficulty sleeping during the day because of big black
birds on the roof outside his apartment eating the woman's body
there.
   ``I had to stay high all the time,'' the confession said.
   Moldovsky has indicated that his defense will be insanity.

   Ten-year-old Kristin Segal wanted to solve
a universal problem, so she decided to make the glue on stamps
taste better by rubbing a banana across the back.
   Robbie Cadle, 10, hates carrying out the garbage so much that he
has set out a project for himself: motorized garbage cans that he
can drive out to the street and back.
   Seth Swanson, 11, wants to make sure he can locate his dog at
night, and he is designing a nighttime dog collar with a light on
it.
   These and other ideas were developed by the fifth-graders at
Dommerich Elementary School as part of the Invent America program,
which seeks to boost the level of creativity and innovation in this
country.
   It may not be possible to teach creativity, but the program
believes that it can certainly be nurtured in schools.
   The privately funded U.S. Patent Model Foundation in Washington
began Invent America a little more than a year ago as part of an
effort to boost the share of inventions patented in this country by
Americans.
   The proportion of patents issued by the U.S. Patent Office to
Americans has dropped from 89 percent in 1966 to 53 percent in
1987. The remainder go to foreign-born inventors who want to
protect their creations in this country.
   The Invent America class is taught at Dommerich one day a week
to each of five classes of gifted students in different grades by
Gil Rowe.
   He came here from Ocoee Elementary School, where he started the
program and had great success. Ocoee won four of Invent America's
nine state awards last year, the most of any school in the country.
   ``We've just kind of forgotten to teach the children the old
American ingenuity,'' says Rowe, 44.
   Eleven-year-old Seth is certain that the creativity class works.
   ``Like when you grow up, if you become a scientist, you'll be a
little bit better at it than someone who never had this before,''
he said.
   Besides opening up the innovative process, Rowe says, the
program enhances students' self-esteem. One Ocoee second-grader who
was emotionally and mentally disturbed and had no friends invented
a device that earned him his classmates' admiration.
   ``Suddenly he became a famous inventor. He just became a totally
different individual,'' Rowe said.
   Only two Orange County schools took part in the program last
year, but two dozen are involved this year, as are others around
the state.
   Four million pupils in kindergarten through eighth grade
participated nationwide in 1987 _ about 13 percent of all students
in those grades, the foundation reported.
   Other inventions have ranged from a self-cleaning bathtub to
salt dyed red so that people can know how much they use.

<HEAD>Ronnie DeSillers Estate Frozen By Judge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD W. SWINTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge froze the remainder of a half million
dollars donated to save liver-transplant patient Ronnie DeSillers
after officials complained that his mother squandered money on a
luxury waterfront apartment, clothes and jewelry.
   ``Immediate and irreparable injury will result to assets of the
estate of Ronald DeSillers Jr. if Maria DeSillers is permitted to
withdraw the funds deposited in the account,'' Dade Circuit Judge
Francis J. Christie wrote in his order Monday.
   When Ronnie died at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh last April
29 at age 7, an account in his name had accumulated $509,913, state
officials said. The account balance on Feb. 17 was $239,288, said
Fred Kerstein, assistant Dade County state attorney.
   ``Our concern was that the remaining assets would be wasted,''
Kerstein said. ``We wanted to safeguard those assets and let the
court determine how they'll be distributed.''
   As recently as Jan. 19, $25,000 was withdrawn from the fund,
said a court document filed by state Attorney General Bob
Butterworth and State Attorney Janet Reno of Miami.
   The state accusation said bank records indicated Ms. DeSillers
spent at least $47,000 on jewelry, clothing, furniture, housing
expenses, an automobile and auto expenses.
   Ronnie, who died last year while awaiting a fourth transplant,
attracted donations from around the country, including $1,000 from
President Reagan, after news reports that money raised by his
classmates had been stolen.
   Ms. DeSillers, who created a foundation to assist other children
in need of organ transplants after her son's death, denied
squandering any of the donations.
   ``Why do they not say that money went to charity?'' Ms.
DeSillers told The Associated Press on Monday night. ``Why do they
not say that some of that money was assigned to me personally? ...
How come they don't say how much of that money went to kids?''
   She said she would straighten out the status of the frozen money
in probate court and use the funds to provide organ transplants for
two children.
   ``There are two children that have less than six months to live,
and that's what I want to do with the money,'' she said.
   Ms. DeSillers' lawyer, Harry Robbins, said his client maintains
she never asked the public to donate money and thus was not legally
a charity. She also has said she was entitled to the money as
Ronnie's sole heir.
   Ms. DeSillers' finances came under question when it was learned
she lived in a luxury apartment building on Biscayne Bay and was
driving a 1985 BMW equipped with a telephone. She contends the car
was second-hand and bought with a loan, that the car telephone was
a gift and the apartment doubled as her office.
   Ms. DeSillers is being sued by Children's Hospital for failing
to pay $261,189 of Ronnie's $424,302 bill. She has charged the
hospital with giving poor care to her son.

<TEXT>
   Syria, the strongest critic of U.S.
Middle East policy, has found ``positive elements'' in American
efforts to reactivate the stalled process but remains suspicious of
the initiative's goals, sources say.
   Syria's leaders are consulting with Jordan and studying
proposals handed last week to President Hafez Assad by Secretary of
State George P. Shultz.
   Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa is expected to fly to Amman
this week to discuss the plan after weekend contacts between Assad
and King Hussein, said the knowledgeable Syrian sources, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   But they question whether the United States is serious about
finding a comprehensive settlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict or
is simply trying to end Palestinian rioting in Israeli-occupied
lands through promises of peace.
   Like all Arab governments, Damascus supports the Palestinian
rebellion in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, unprecedented in the
40-year-old conflict, that threatens Washington's Middle East ally
with a prolonged civil war.
   More than 80 Palestinians have been killed in the violence that
has plagued the occupied territories since Dec. 8 in what Arabs
hail as the ``intafada,'' or uprising. There have been no Israel
fatalities in the rioting.
   Syria, Moscow's main Arab ally and a key player in the Middle
East, remains suspicious of attempts to isolate issues involved in
the quest for a settlement into separate negotiations, a strategy
it believes favors Israel.
   Syria believes it has a better chance of regaining the strategic
Golan Heights, captured by Israel in 1967, through a comprehensive
settlement. Unlike the other occupied territories, Israel annexed
the heights in 1981.
   Charles Snow, a veteran Middle East analyst, wrote in the
respected Middle East Economic Survey: ``There is one major problem
which clearly has the potential to derail the entire process _ the
Golan Heights.
   ``Syria has always been deeply suspicious that attempts to
separate the issues in the Arab-Israeli conflict are merely
camouflage for a partial settlement which will leave Israel in ...
possession of the Golan.''
   The U.S. plan would convene an international conference within a
few weeks. By May 1, Israel and a joint delegation of Jordanians
and Palestinians would discuss limited self-rule for the 1.5
million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza for an interim
three-year period. Later in the year, a wider international
conference would bring in other parties to debate the ultimate
future of the occupied Arab land captured by Israel in the 1967 war.
   A Syrian source said the main question is how much pressure
Washington is prepared to exert on Israel to accept a ``land for
peace'' exchange.
   The Arabs, including Syria, spearhead of Arab radicalism, have
accepted this principle. But Israeli hardliners reject withdrawal
from lands it seized in 1967 and are at odds with moderates over
the way to go. Arabs fear the Israeli impasse could block any
progress.
   Some Syrian officials question the sincerity of an initiative
launched by the Reagan administration, which they say has done
little to rein in Israel.
   Since Reagan was elected in 1980, Israel attacked Iraq's nuclear
plant in 1981, annexed the Golan Heights later that year, invaded
Lebanon in 1982, bombed the PLO's headquarters in Tunisia in 1984
and continued to build settlements in the occupied territories.
   Israel also has defied a series of U.N. resolutions condemning
its repeated air raids on Palestinian bases in Lebanon.
   Furthermore, Arab officials stress, the Reagan adminstration has
made no effort to pressure Israel to honor commitments under the
Camp David accords which called for Palestinian self-rule.
   The accords, signed by Egypt and Israel in 1978 under the
sponsorship of former President Carter, has been dormant since
Reagan took office.
   Syria, like other Arab governments, denounced the accord as
violating Arab summit resolutions that banned seperate peace
treaties with Israel outside a comprehensive settlement.
   But, with U.S. presidential elections only a few months away,
the Syrians are wondering what guarantees Shultz can offer that any
accord reached under Reagan would be honored by Israel after the
change of adminstration.
   A commentary by state-run Damascus Radio said that although the
exact details of the U.S. proposal have not been made public, Arab
leaders felt it was an American effort to monopolize the peace
initiative, outside the framework of the United Nations, and to
keep out the Soviet Union.
   But the commentary, the first official reaction to Shultz's
plan, welcomed Washington's renewed interest in resolving the
conflict and its support for an international peace conference as a
step in the right direction.

   Mikhail Gorbachev's chief economic adviser
has cut short his visit to Silicon Valley because of his mother's
death in the Soviet Union.
   Abel Aganbegyan had planned a three-day tour that included
visits to Sun Microsystems and Acuson, both in Mountain View. Sun
Microsystems makes desktop workstations while Acuson produces
medical imaging equipment.
   Aganbegyan held a brief news conference at San Francisco
International Airport on Monday.
   ``American citizens know very little about joint ventures with
the Soviet Union,'' he said.
   The Soviet official said the United States is ``putting up
obstacles in the way of technology transfers. Other countries, such
as Japan, do not.''
   Aganbegyan is an architect of ''perestroika,'' Gorbachev's
wholesale restructuring of the stagnant economy.
   The visit to Santa Clara County was to have been the final part
of an 18-day trip through six American cities to increase interest
among U.S. companies in joint ventures with the Soviets.

<HEAD>Man Parachutes Off Downtown Chicago Building, Lands On Car At
Light</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man parachuted off a downtown building, landing
on a car that was stopped at a red light, then jumped into another
car and fled, police said today.
   Officer Thomas Karczewski said police had no suspects but were
checking a license plate number provided by Musiliu Alagbala, whose
car was hit by the parachutist Monday afternoon.
   Karczewski said today he didn't think the parachutist was
injured.
   Witnesses told police the parachutist jumped off a building that
was under construction and landed on the hood of Alagbala's car.
   Alagbala, 38, ``was waiting at the light when he saw a man roll
off the hood with a parachute on,'' Patrolman Charles Weyer said
Monday.
   ``He folded up his parachute, went running across the street and
jumped into a car,'' said Bonnie Panagakis, 39, of Palatine, who
saw the incident.
   Mrs. Panagakis said she saw a man flying ``higher than the light
poles'' above the Chicago River.
   ``I think he saw he was about to go into the river, and he had
to get himself righted,'' she said.
   She said that he maneuvered his parachute back toward the street
but that the parachute was torn by a lamppost. ``That's when he
landed on the guy's hood,'' she said.
   Alagbala said the man caused between $300 and $500 damage to the
car.

<TEXT>
   More than 500 elementary school children and
whale watchers stared in horror as a container ship hit a 35-foot
gray whale as it swam four miles off shore, witnesses said.
   The 30-ton mother whale, which was escorting its calf along with
another cow and calf pair, was hit Saturday while migrating north
toward the Arctic.
   ``The children were just devastated. One little boy wanted to
swim out and help the whale,'' said Nancy Pavlich, a first grade
teacher at Deer Canyon Elementary School in suburban Alta Loma.
   Robert Yoshitomi, a lawyer for Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK),
Japanese owners of the container ship Hakusan II, said company
officials were looking into the case.
   ``We're still checking,'' he said. ``We're sorry for any
difficulty that was caused. As far as we know, it was
unintentional.''
   Pavlich said many of the children were still somber about the
incident Monday morning and some students are writing letters about
the whales and sending them to the Coast Guard.
   The whale slid along the side of the ship, broke free from the
ship's current, swam helplessly for a minute than made a final blow
of air before sinking, witnesses said.
   ``Kids were screaming and crying as they were watching this,''
said Bill Samaras, a marine biology teacher at Carson High School
who was aboard the children's boat.
   ``We had been following the whales for about 15 minutes when we
noticed the container ship coming from the southwest. It then very
drastically turned and crossed our path.
   ``I thought, `They're going to hit the whales,' and we tried to
contact the ship on the emergency radio but I guess they weren't
monitoring the line.''
   ``At this point we can't confirm its death, but there is a good
chance that it died, we just can't say for sure,'' said Tom Lewis,
biologist at the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History and
president of the American Cetacean Society.
   The Hakusan II, 209 feet long and with a dead weight of 20,934
tons, arrived at the Port of Los Angeles on Saturday and left
Sunday evening headed to Taiwan, officials said.
   Samaras, a research associate with the county museum, said he
was certain the ship's navigators didn't see the swimming mammals.
   ``To them it was like a road kill,'' he said. ``Like killing a
chipmunk with your car,'' he said. ``I'm sure it was nothing
intentional. They didn't know they hit it.''
   Samaras said he plans to file a complaint with the Coast Guard
about the ship, which he said changed course and came about 150
yards in front of the whale watching charters.

   Typhoon Bola pounded the east
coast of New Zealand's North Island today, killing at least one
person and forcing the evacuation of 2,500 people.
   The high winds also fanned a bush fire on South Island that
consumed nearly 1,000 acres before it was brought under control.
   Four towns and portions of Gisborne were evacuated during
widespread flooding, civil defense spokesman Doug Bent said.
Authorities declared a state of emergency.
   Residents were ordered out of low-lying areas as a precaution
against rising rivers. At least four people were lost in the
floodwaters and one body was recovered, officials said.
   Insurance companies estimated damage at hundreds of millions of
dollars. The most serious damage was on the east coast of North
Island, where homes were heavily damaged as far north as Auckland.
   In New Plymouth on the west side of the island, winds damaged
more than 300 homes and several high-rise buildings. Bola was
expected to pass over the north island later Tuesday.
   Winds of up to 93 mph began pounding the region late Sunday as
Bola moved southwest across the Pacific Ocean after leaving more
than 100 people homeless on the small island nation of Vanuatu.
   A state of emergency was declared around Gisborne and in Wairoa
after that town's main bridge collapsed.

   A man who killed one worshipper and wounded
four others in a church shooting spree had been spurned by a former
member of the congregation and talked about her after he was
captured, parishioners said.
   Cheun-phon Ji, 29, a native of Taiwan who earned a master's
degree from Emporia State University in December 1984, was charged
Monday with one count of first-degree murder and six counts of
attempted first-degree murder. Bond was set at $1 million and a
preliminary hearing was scheduled for March 31.
   One person was killed and four wounded in the Sunday morning
shooting spree at Calvary Baptist Church. Parishioners wrestled the
gunman to the ground after a church trustee chased him outside and
struck him with a hymnal.
   As he was being brought to the courthouse Monday past a crowd of
journalists, Ji was asked why the shootings occurred. He shouted,
``Justice, revenge.''
   Church members said Monday that Ji had attended a church service
or Bible study with a woman named Georgia Ann Mejia several years
ago. He apparently was rejected by the woman when he asked her to
marry him, they said.
   Allen Bush, a church trustee, said he and three other men
surrounded Ji outside the church after the shooting.
   ``He said, `Don't you remember? Don't you remember?''' Bush
said. ``We said, `Remember what?' He said, `Georgia.' More than one
of us said, `Georgia who?' At that point he answered, `Georgia
Mejia.'''
   Mejia, 27, was married Nov. 4, 1985 and her name is now Georgia
Ann Johnson, according to court records. She transferred to another
Baptist church about four years ago, her mother said.

   Police detained nine
journalists, assaulted a television soundman and confiscated their
film during an anti-apartheid demonstration this morning by about
100 black women.
   Riot and security police arrived outside the Chamber of Mines
about 10 minutes after the peaceful protest began and the crowd
began to disperse.
   Police began taking journalists into custody, including crew
members of the American network, CBS, and London-based World
Television News, and taking film out of photographers' cameras.
   Soundman Prince Msuthu of World Television News said police
punched him with fists and poked him in the stomach with their
batons. He said he had bruises on his arms and intended to file
charges.
   Other journalists saw police dragging him toward the vehicle and
holding him in a wrist-lock.
   ``They were manhandling me, pushing me around up to the point
where the recorder on my shoulder fell on the ground,'' he said.
``They put me into the truck and as I was getting into the truck
one of them assaulted me, using the baton.
   ``They kept on punching me, saying that I am `cheeky,' '' Msuthu
said after he was released from police custody and his recorded
cassette confiscated.
   Police spokesman Col. Frans Malherbe said police took nine
journalists to police headquarters and confiscated their film. But
he denied they were detained or arrested. He said they could face
charges ``if they have done something wrong.''
   ``We arrived on the scene and had to deal with the news people
somehow. ... so we took them to an office at John Vorster Square,''
he said, adding that emergency regulations prohibit members of the
news media from being at the scene of unrest.
   However, journalists at the scene disputed Malherbe's statement
that police gave notice the gathering was illegal.
   The protesters, members of the Federation of Transvaal Women,
called on the nation's largest mining houses and biggest foreign
currency earners to take a tougher line against government
restrictions on anti-apartheid organizations.
   The women sang ``God Bless Africa,'' and unfurled posters
addressed to the chamber saying: ``Your Silence is Conspiracy,''
``Bannings Protect Mine Profits,'' ``Unban Democracy,'' and
``Chamber of Mines Speak.''
   The women's federation is an affiliate of the United Democratic
Front, one of 18 organizations the government banned on Feb. 24
from any political activity.
   The Congress of South African Trade Unions, whose biggest
affiliate is the 300,000-member black national Union of
Mineworkers, was also banned from any political activity.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   A federal judge has tacked an additional 10 days
onto a restraining order preventing two American banks from
transferring an estimated $50 million to the national bank of
Panama.
   On Monday, U.S. District Judge Lloyd F. MacMahon extended the
order he had issued Thursday that prevented three banks from
transacting any business with or transferring funds to the Banco
Nacional de Panama.
   He also said he would sign a stipulation dropping Irving Trust
as the third bank in the suit, which was filed on behalf of the
Republic of Panama at federal court in Manhattan.
   Ousted Panamanian President Eric Arturo Delvalle is still
recognized by the U.S. government as the legitimate head of Panama,
and the order effectively prevents the funds from being transferred
to the regime of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, Panama's military
leader.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Kenneth Handal told the court that
Irving Trust had agreed to a permanent injunction against
transferring funds until the situation in Panama has been resolved.
   Lawyers for Marine Midland and Bankers Trust told the court that
the situation in Panama remained unclear and said they would
respect the court's wishes.
   Criminal attorney Barry Slotnick asked to intervene on behalf of
Banco Nacional de Panama because of what he said was Panama's
urgent need for cash. Banks in Panama remained closed for a fifth
day Monday, sparking a demonstration by thousands of retired people
unable to cash their pension checks.
   Last Wednesday another bank, Republic National Bank of New York,
agreed to transfer $10 million to the Federal Reserve Bank.
   Two U.S. grand juries in Florida indicted Noriega on drug
charges Feb. 4. Delvalle sought to dismiss Noriega Feb. 25, but was
ousted the next day by Noriega supporters and went into hiding.
   Last Tuesday, Delvalle froze all Panamanian assets outside the
country.

   The Rapides Parish sheriff's office,
trying to find local satanists, has ordered the library here to
turn over a list of people who have checked out books on the occult
in the last year.
   Assistant District Attorney Dexter Ryland said he has advised
Rapides Parish Library officials to withhold the information until
his office can determine if the order is an invasion of privacy.
   ``We are working on it. We haven't formulated our final legal
opinion on it,'' Ryland said Monday. ``It struck me when it was
called to my attention that it could possibly violate the privacy
of individuals.''
   Chief Deputy Tommy Hollingsworth said his office is ``simply
trying to get some intelligence'' on serious followers of satanic
beliefs because ``a lot of times it is connected with narcotics.''
   Lynn Dunn, who works in the sheriff's narcotics office, said the
names and addresses were subpoenaed ``to weed out the curious from
the serious'' followers of satanism.
   It is not an invasion of the readers' privacy ``because no one
is going to be contacted or anything like that,'' she said.
   Hollingsworth said his office is not investigating any specific
incidents involving devil worshippers. The sheriff's office is
simply updating files it has kept for the last 15 years, he said.
   Library Director Stephen Rogge said it is his policy not to
release such information simply on a request, but he could be
forced to comply because of the court order.
   Rogge said he would consider the sheriff's request an invasion
of privacy ``unless there is a good reason for it.'' If the
district attorney's office determines there are not sufficient
grounds to turn over the list, Rogge said he won't do it.
   Rapides Chief of Detectives William Earl Hilton said there may
be some satanic activity in the parish, but so far it has not been
linked to any crime.

<TEXT>
   A South African diplomat has been
charged with assault after his car hit a protester and a police
officer outside a radio station where he had been interviewed.
   South Burlington Police Chief John Race said South African Vice
Consul Duke Kent Brown was arrested by South Burlington police
Monday about a quarter-mile from the scene of the incident.
   Brown was charged with simple assault, released on his own
recognizance and ordered to appear in court in April. Race said the
charge carries up to a year in prison and a fine of $1,000.
   Police said Brown left the Burlington area following his release
and failed to make three other scheduled appearances.
   Jim Condon, news director at radio station WJOY-WQCR and a
witness to the incident, said the protester who was struck, Laurie
Larson of Richmond, suffered minor bruises.
   Race identified the injured officer as Todd Shepard and said he
had suffered bruises on his leg.
   Race said police had called the State Department in Washington
to ask if Brown was covered by diplomatic immunity and were told
``to treat this case like any other.''
   A spokesman in the South African embassy in Washington, Third
Secretary Heyn Van Rooyen, said Brown is connected with the South
African consulate in New York.
   Van Rooyen said, ``There are different degrees of diplomatic
immunity,'' and he was not sure that consular officials are given
the same degree of protection as those connected with embassies.
   Race said he hoped police could proceed with the case.
``Politics don't enter into the justice system, as far as I'm
concerned.''
   Condon said about 30 members of the Vermont Committee on
Southern Africa had gathered outside the station to protest Brown's
participation in a talk show, ``Viewpoint,'' which was broadcast
beginning at 9 a.m.
   He said Brown left the station under police escort and made his
way to a car in a nearby parking lot. Brown got into the car and a
few of the protesters sat on the hood, Condon said.
   Protesters were climbing off the hood of the car without any
resistance, Condon said, when Brown ``hit the accelerator'' and the
incident occurred.
   Philip Fiermonte, one of the leaders of the protest, said Brown
``shows disregard for humanity, as (South Africa's) apartheid
policies have.''

   Harry D. Williams, a Yurok Indian
who served as Stanford University's mascot for 21 years until
protests arose against the school's Indian symbol, died on Sunday.
He was 64.
   Williams, who was ``Prince Lighfoot'' from 1951 to 1972, died of
injuries suffered in an automobile accident.
   Williams, a graduate of the University of San Francisco, first
performed an Indian dance at a Stanford rally when he was 27.
   He was such a favorite he was asked to lead the university band
onto the football field, which he did until 1972. In that year, the
school dropped the nickname Indians after complaints of racism,
changing it to Cardinal.
   Williams was active in Indian affairs and served as chairman of
the California Rural Indian Health Board.

   Iraq said its warplanes hit a ``very big
naval target'' in the Persian Gulf today, breaking a three-week
lull in attacks on Iran's oil shipping.
   The two nations also kept up their brutal barrage of missile
attacks, firing surface-to-surface rockets into each other's
capital cities. Iran accused the United States and France of
helping Iraq refit Soviet-designed missiles to give them enough
range to reach Tehran.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said Iraqi jets struck
``accurately and effectively'' at the naval target off the Iran
coast and returned safely to base.
   It was the first raid on a ``large naval target'' _ Iraq's term
for an Iranian tanker _ since Feb. 16. The last independently
confirmed attack by Iranian warplanes was on Feb. 12.
   The last time that Iran is known to have attacked a ship, in
retaliation for Iraq's air raids on its own shipping, was on Feb.
11.
   Since then, the two belligerents, at war for 7{ years, have
battered each other's capitals with long-range missiles and struck
other population centers with artillery and bombs.
   Hundreds of civilian casualties are believed to have resulted
from the bombardments.
   Also today, Iranian Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani
accused the United States and France of helping Iraq modify
Soviet-made missiles to reach longer-range targets in Iran. Tehran
is 290 miles from the Iraqi border.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported that an
Iraqi missile crashed into a residential neighborhood of Tehran
about midnight, killing or wounding several civilians.
   State-run Baghdad Radio reported that Iraqi gunners fired the
missile into Tehran, a city of 6 million, early today less than an
hour after Iran claimed it lobbed a projectile into Baghdad.
   Tehran Radio said President Ali Khamenei, who visited a bombed
Tehran neighborhood, said ``Our nation will never forget those who
have assisted the criminal in perpetrating its crime.'' Unlike
Rafsanjani, Khamenei did not refer to any specific country.
   Iraq's news agency confirmed the an Iranian missile strike on a
residential area in Baghdad, saying civilians, including women,
children and eldery people, were killed. No figures were given.
   Iran's news agency said Revolutionary Guards today shot a
missile at a ``military center'' at Amarah, an Iraqi town close to
the border and halfway between Baghdad and the southern port city
of Basra.
   The reports were monitored in Nicosia.
   Iraq said it fired three missiles into Tehran on Monday, and
Iran reported its Revolutionary Guards blasted Baghdad with four
missiles and launched a fifth at the northern city of Mosul for the
first time.
   Iraq confirmed only two missiles crashed Monday in Baghdad, a
city of 5 million, killing or wounding ``many civilians, including
women and children.''
   Iraq says it has fired 42 projectiles into Tehran since the
missile duel began.
   The Iranians have reported more than 30 missiles have hit
Tehran. They said Revolutionary Guards fired 25 long-range missiles
on Iraq during that period, 23 of them on Baghdad. The Iraqis have
only acknowledged 19 hits on the capital and one on Mosul.
   Both sides reported air raids on each other's cities and
artillery bombardment of border towns on Monday.
   IRNA said 30 civilians were killed and more than 100 people
wounded in Monday's Iraqi missile attacks on Tehran's residential
areas. It reported one missile demolished a clinic, a school and
several houses.
   Iran has listed at least 122 civilians killed and more than 300
wounded in the Iraqi missile blitz, with more than 100 killed and
more than 500 wounded in air raids over the last week. The Iraqis
have reported heavy civilian casualties, but gave no exact figures.
   Iran last week accused Moscow of supplying Iraq with the
missiles, triggering several violent protests outside the Soviet
Embassy in Tehran and the consulate-general in the central city of
Isfahan. The Soviet Union who, along with France, is main arms
supplier of Iraq, denied the charge.
   The Soviet Union, meanwhile, called for Security Council
condemnation Monday of the war.
   ``Under the circumstances, the Security Council has to do
something in order to eliminate the damage of the further
escalation of the military conflict between Iran and Iraq,'' Soviet
Ambassador Alexander M. Belonogov told reporters.

   Dukakis had closed his Super Tuesday campaign Monday night,
worrying about the last-minute impact of negative campaign ads
aired by Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore in Texas and North Carolina.
   ``They hurt, there's no question about it,'' Dukakis said as his
campaign plane headed for Boston on Monday night after a day of
campaigning in the South. ``By the time you find out what they're
doing it's too late.''
   Dukakis said of the latest Gore ad, ``It's a piece of garbage.''
   The comments were a final note of concern following an otherwise
upbeat weekend of campaigning that saw large crowds, extensive
media coverage and a few key endorsements.
   Dukakis planned to spend the day at his Statehouse office and
then fly to Chicago to begin campaigning in the next battleground _
Illinois, which holds its primary a week from today.
   In his final stop in the Raleigh-Durham area Monday night,
Dukakis once again rejected the notion that he is the most liberal
of the Democratic candidates, saying he preferred the label
``progressive.''
   Among the positions that have helped pin the label liberal on
Dukakis are his opposition to aid to Nicaraguan Contra rebels, his
opposition to any cuts in social spending, his opposition to a
space-based missile defense system and the Midgetman missile and
his support of closer relations with Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   But Dukakis insisted that he has also cut taxes in Massachusetts
_ even though some of those tax cuts occurred over his initial
objections. He said he has balanced nine consecutive budgets and
has cut crime in Massachusetts. In his work with other governors,
he said the most consistently progressive are those from the
Southern states.
   In addition to stops in Miami, Plant City, Fla., and
Raleigh-Durham, Dukakis squeezed 21 television interviews into his
schedule Monday.
   Still, he said, ``Don't let them tell you this is a television
campaign. This is a grass-roots campaign and if we're successful,
it will be because of our organization.''
   The Dukakis organization is recognized as the best-funded and
most extensive in Texas, Florida and Washington state, among the 20
Super Tuesday states holding presidential primaries and caucuses
today. In North Carolina, though, campaign organizers predicted
Dukakis would finish third there behind Jesse Jackson and Gore.
   Dukakis kicked off the day of campaigning in perhaps his most
solid base of support in the South: Miami.
   At a senior citizens rally, Dukakis picked up the coveted
endorsement of 70-year-old Annie Ackerman, not a household name,
but someone with a reputation in Miami for being able to get out
the vote.
   The woman who was a ward organizer for Chicago Mayor Richard
Daley spurned other Democratic suitors and endorsed the
Massachusetts governor at a morning rally attended by about 500
senior citizens.

   A man who went without sleep for a week
in order to watch over his wife, who reportedly suffered from
Alzheimer's disease, apparently shot her to death and then killed
himself, officials said.
   The bodies of Douglas and Clodene Schofield, both 67, were found
Monday morning at their home in a trailer park, said Butler County
Coroner Pete Tutchtone.
   ``She had gotten to where she was straying away from the
trailer,'' Tutchtone said. ``I guess she had Alzheimer's disease.''
   Tutchtone said Schofield realized he needed help in caring for
his wife, but he could not bear to part with her. ``He didn't want
to put her in a nursing home,'' he said.
   The coroner said neighbors contacted authorities last week after
Mrs. Schofield strayed. ``She walked out of the trailer and got
locked out and neighbors called the sheriff to get her back in,''
he said.
   Neighbors said Schofield had not slept for the week so he could
watch her and keep her from wandering again.
   Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, irreversible neurological
disorder that results in gradual memory loss, impairment of
judgment, disorientation and loss of language skills.
   Tutchtone said Schofield used a .38-caliber handgun to kill his
wife and then himself.

   Palestinians stabbed to death
an Arab policeman suspected of aiding Israel and wrapped his body
in a Palestinian flag, and another Arab was killed today by Israeli
gunfire, hospital officials and witnesses said.
   The suspected collaborator was slain in a refugee camp near
Jericho, the reports said, the second killing of a suspected
collaborator in the occupied territories since Palestinian unrest
began Dec. 8.
   The army confirmed that the body of Nabil Juma Farah, 30, had
been found in the Aqbat Jaber refugee camp, but said it was
investigating the cause of his death.
   According to U.N. figures, 83 Arabs have been killed by Israelis
since the riots began in the lands Israel captured during the 1967
Middle East war.
   Elsewhere in the West Bank, doctors said three male protesters
were wounded today by Israeli gunfire and Arab women heeded
underground calls to demonstrate.
   Also today, the military said four army officers who were
unarmed when three PLO guerrillas commandeered their car and went
on to hijack a bus Monday were sentenced to 35 days in jail for not
carrying weapons.
   The major and three lieutenants were on their way to an army
sporting event and were in track suits. The four fled when the
guerrillas opened fire on their car, the army reported.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said the bus hijacking in which
the guerrillas and three Israeli hostages were killed was initiated
by the same element that is behind three months of Arab rioting in
the occupied lands.
   ``These are the same people who incite violence in the
territories,'' Shamir said on Israel radio after the attack in
southern Israel. ``We shall not tire fighting them.''
   Also today in the West Bank village of Mazraa Sharqiya, 10 miles
northwest of Ramallah, family members and the Arab-owned Palestine
Press Service blamed Jewish settlers for the shooting death of
Khader Mohammed Hamideh.
   Hamideh, a 45-year-old coffee shop owner, died of a gunshot
wound to the heart, said Dr. Yasser Obeid, director of Ramallah
Hospital.
   A man who identified himself as Hamideh's nephew and spoke on
condition of anonymity said Israeli settlers entered the village
today and shot his uncle without provocation as he stood outside
his home.
   Hospital officials in Jericho said the Arab police officer, of
the nearby Aqbat Jaber refugee camp died Monday night of three stab
wounds to the chest and stomach. The army said it was investigating.
   Local residents, who demanded anonymity, said Farah's body was
wrapped in the outlawed Palestinian flag and dropped at his
mother's doorstep inside the refugee camp, where 2,600 Palestinians
live.
   They said the army detained seven camp residents in connection
with the slaying. An Associated Press reporter saw five army jeeps
parked in front of the camp and dozens of soldiers questioning
residents.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, officials at Al Ittihad
Hospital said they treated three Palestinians shot today by Israeli
troops, including a 19-year-old from the Balata refugee camp who
was in serious condition after being shot in the groin.
   Another Arab from Balata was shot in the right ear and a third
from Nablus was wounded in the right leg, the officials said. The
army said it was investigating the shootings.
   The PLO, in a leaflet distributed last week, called on
Palestinians to take revenge against collaborators. The leaflet
also called on Palestinian women to demonstrate today. Hundreds of
women in east Jerusalem and Ramallah heeded the call.
   Police used tear gas to break up two protests by women in east
Jerusalem, said police spokesman Rafi Levy. Police arrested seven
women and two were hospitalized with tear gas poisoning after they
threw stones at a police patrol car and briefly blocked one street,
Levy said.
   On Monday night, the army bulldozed the homes of two
Palestinians who allegedly killed an Arab they suspected of
collaborating with Israel.
   Israeli troops demolished the homes of the two residents of
Bidou, near Ramallah, the army reported. The army suspects the two
of taking part in the killing four months ago of Adnan Saadi, an
alleged collaborator with Israel.

<TEXT>
   Some Assemblies of God members have left the
fold or are seeking counseling because of the Rev. Jimmy Swaggart's
alleged sexual misconduct, says a minister who has talked to the
television evangelist.
   ``I hope to God there aren't any more'' sex scandals, added Glyn
Lowery, pastor of Pace Assembly of God in this Pensacola suburb.
``I don't know how we'll stand many more scandals in the Assemblies
of God. It has shaken our movement tremendously.''
   Another Assemblies of God television evanglist, Jim Bakker, was
the subject of earlier reports that he had sex with a church
secretary.
   Lowery was one of about a half-dozen ministers called to Baton
Rouge, La., to counsel Swaggart in the wake of reports he had been
photographed with a prostitute in New Orleans.
   ``He is a broken man,'' Lowery said Sunday. ``As he told me,
`Glyn, nobody could exact any punishment on me greater than that
which I put upon my own self for what I done.' ''
   Church officials have proposed to relieve Swaggart of his
ministry for three months.
   ``Some preachers feel like he needs a year out of the pulpit;
others don't,'' Lowery said. ``For him to stay out of the pulpit
for a year would be a death sentence to his ministry ... but that's
something he should have thought about when he went to New
Orleans.''

<TEXT>
   Libya's official news agency said today 130
foreigners, including one American, have been released from prison
in Libya.
   The JANA news agency report, monitored in Rome, carried
expressions of gratitude from prisoners from West Germany, Italy
and the United States.
   JANA mentioned a ``U.S. prisoner'' and quoted him as expressing
his happiness and gratitude.
   The Belgian ambassador, Camille Reynens, reached by telephone
from Rome, said the American was staying at his residence but
declined to give his name or any details about the case.
   Belgium represents U.S. interests in Libya.
   JANA said the prisoners were released Monday in a ceremony
attended by diplomats from embassies in Tripoli representing the
various prisoners.
   The report did not say what the freed prisoners had been charged
with, but the Italian Foreign Ministry in Rome said three Italians
released were businessmen accused by Libya of defaulting on
contracts.
   The JANA dispatch quoted a Libyan Foreign Ministry official as
telling the diplomats that the prisoner release was an expression
of the ``freedom and liberty'' brought by Libya's 1969 revolution
and evidence of its ``humanitarian aspect.''
   Last week, Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi, driving a
bulldozer, knocked down a wall of a Tripoli prison to release
prisoners as part of an amnesty he declared. JANA said 400
prisoners were freed.
   Gadhafi announced he was releasing all Libyan prisoners except
those accused of plotting with foreign countries.

   A former independent record promoter pleaded
innocent to charges he paid more than $200,000 to radio station
program directors to get his records on the air.
   William Craig, 42, of Scottsdale, Ariz., also is accused of
deducting the alleged payments from his corporate income taxes.
   Trial was set for May 3.
   Also Monday, Ralph and Valerie Tashjian were ordered to enter
pleas next week on similar payola charges.
   Ralph Tashjian is accused of giving cash and cocaine to radio
program directors in Fresno and El Paso, Texas. He and his wife are
charged with evading taxes on $300,000 in corporate income between
1983-85.
   Craig, who is free on $50,000 bail, the Tashjians and a former
Los Angeles radio station vice president and general manager,
George Wilson Crowell, also known as George Wilson, were named in a
Feb. 26 indictment that culminated a two-year grand jury probe into
payola allegations.
   Crowell faces arraignment next week.

   A Kuwaiti held his two wives and 13 sons at
gunpoint for more than two days and fired randomly at police,
injuring one man, before surrendering, the Interior Ministry said
today.
   Nasser Farraj al-Rukeibi released his family members unharmed
and gave up late Monday, a ministry spokesman said. One of the
women was eight months pregnant and the eldest of the sons was less
than 7 years old.
   Police were interrogating al-Rukeibi to determine his motives
but they did not think the 58-hour standoff was related to his
polygamous marriage, sources said. Al-Rukeibi, a Moslem, is
permittted by Islamic law to have up to four wives.
   One neighbor was slightly injured by a stray bullet when
al-Rukeibi began firing in response to police attempts to talk him
into releasing the hostages.
   Police and special forces staked out the family home and used
bullhorns to negotiate with al-Rukeibi. Authorities said he
threatened to kill his wives and sons if the house was stormed.
   The sources, who could not be named under police regulations,
said the standoff began Saturday morning when al-Rukeibi clashed
with his personnel manager at the Ministry of Communications where
he is employed.
   Al-Rukeibi pulled out a revolver and opened fire, but no
injuries were reported. He then rushed to his car and drove to his
home at Firdous, a suburb 10 miles north of the city center, where
took his wives and sons hostage.

<HEAD>Brother of Hostage Says Hostages Should Be Campaign Issue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The brother of an American being held hostage
in Lebanon said today he thinks the hostages should be an issue
discussed by the U.S. presidential candidates.
   ``They have never mentioned a word,'' said Anthony Cicippio,
whose brother, Joseph, has been held for 18 months.
   ``I think they're treating it like a hot potato. They're just
laying off of it,'' he said on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''
   He also chided members of Congress for what he said was a lack
of concern for the hostages.
   ``We sent 300 letters to the congressmen and senators over the
last six months and, through that time, we've only received 13
replies,'' he said. One of them, whom he did not identify, asked
for a campaign contribution, said Cicippio, of Norristown, Pa.
   ``I live on hope,'' said Peggy Say, who joined Cicippio on the
program. Her brother, Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, was abducted March 16, 1985.
He has been held longer than any of the nine Americans in captivity.
   Mrs. Say said increased activity involving the search for Lt.
Col. William Higgins, who was kidnapped three weeks ago, gives her
some hope. But she said the hostage families should not ``have to
wait for a time when we could attach ourselves to a larger issue.''
   ``I think the (Reagan) administration is consistently saying
this is too complicated and that quiet diplomacy is the answer.
None of these things are acceptable any more,'' said Mrs. Say, of
Batavia, N.Y.
   She noted that a ceremony will be held in Washington March 16 to
mark the third anniversary of her brother's abduction. The event,
sponsored by No Greater Love, a humanitarian organization, and the
Journalists' Committee to Free Terry Anderson, is to be duplicated
in other areas across the country and is indicative of a growing
grass-roots movement to gain the hostages' freedom, she said.
   ``It's a human rights violation and I think Americans are
unwilling to be silent any more about it,'' she said.

   A bus carrying American tourists from Israel to
Egypt today skidded on a wet highway east of the occupied Gaza
Strip and flipped over, injuring all 56 people on board, hospital
officials and radio reports said.
   The bus was taking members of the United Methodist Church, West
Virginia Conference, on a tour of the Middle East, said a church
spokeswoman in Charleston, W.Va.
   Debbie McGraw, a church secretary, said the accident injured 55
tour members and the bus driver.
   The bus was carrying lay people and clergy from various parts of
West Virginia as well as relatives from Virginia and possibly other
states, McGraw said.
   The U.S. Embassy initially said all the passengers were from
West Virginia. It refused to identify any of the tourists.
   Most of the Americans suffered fractured limbs, including broken
hands, wrists and shoulder bones, or cuts requiring stitches, said
a surgeon in the emergency room of Barzilai Hospital in Ashkelon,
40 miles southeast of Jerusalem.
   Five of the Americans suffered more serious fractures that would
require orthopedic therapy, but none were in critical condition,
said the surgeon, who spoke on condition of anonymity in a
telephone interview.
   Police commander Ezra Menashe told army radio the accident
occurred when the bus from the East Jerusalem Tourism Co. went out
of control on a curve on the road between Miflasim and Kfar Azza,
two kibbutzim or collective farms located about three miles east of
the Gaza Strip.
   The radio said the driver lost control of the bus which careened
onto a field adjacent to the highway and overturned.
   ``There was heavy rain and suddenly the bus overturned and
everyone started screaming,'' passenger Rick Farley, of Dunbar,
W.Va., told the Itim news agency. ``People in passing cars provided
some first aid and then the ambulances came.''
   The bus, which departed from the northern city of Tiberias, was
headed for the Egyptian border crossing at Rafah, on the southern
tip of the Gaza Strip, army radio said.
   A hospital spokesman denied a request by The Associated Press to
speak with them.

<TEXT>
   An appearance by two members of the Ku
Klux Klan at a free speech forum turned into a massive
demonstration at the University of Kansas as protesters waved signs
and shouted slogans.
   An estimated 3,000 people, some shouting ``KKK not today'' and
``Don't go in,'' protested outside Monday night as about 2,000
people gathered inside Hoch Auditorium.
   No serious violence was reported, but several windows were
broken as protesters tried to push their way into the auditorium.
Police wearing riot gear guarded the entrances to the building,
breaking up one shouting match and ejecting another person.
   The forum was delayed for about 20 minutes when eight black
ministers from Lawrence and Kansas City stood up and began singing
spirituals. The audience joined in and gave the ministers two
standing ovations before the forum began.
   The ministers continued singing throughout most of the evening
before marching out a side door in protest.
   One of the Klan members, Thom Robb, of Harrison, Ark., accused
the ministers of stifling free speech.
   ``These people are so filled with hatred and bigotry they refuse
to let you hear us,'' said Robb, national chaplain of the Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan. He was accompanied by J. Allen Moran, Exalted
Cyclops of the Missouri Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.
   Allan Hanson, a professor of anthropology participating in the
forum, told the students to listen to the Klan members and make up
their own minds.
   ``If you find the ideas here are ugly or twisted, use your own
judgment and freedom of expression to tell other people that,''
Hanson said.
   Another participant, journalism professor Ted Frederickson, said
he wanted to stand up for free speech, even though the Klan had
denied that right to people working for civil rights in the South.
   ``Those people were met with bombs and guns and fists and
violence,'' he said. ``But I believe in free expression, even for
the Klan.''
   Michael Foubert, a graduate student and head of the group that
sponsored the forum, said he invited the KKK members to the campus
as a way of examining whether a university should support free
speech for all viewpoints.
   Foubert, director of ``Slightly Older Americans for Freedom,''
organized the forum after faculty members last month canceled a
planned visit to campus by two Klan members. The two had been
scheduled to speak to a journalism class for an exercise on
reporting on extremist groups and participate in a student radio
talk show.
   Black ministers in the Lawrence area and the Black Student Union
had opposed the visit.
   David Ambler, KU vice chancellor for student affairs, said the
university did not interfere with the forum because it was
sponsored by a student organization.
   ``Students have a right to explore ideas. We're obligated to
protect that right,'' Ambler said. ``I hope a lot of learning goes
on tonight.''
   Mia Crawford, a black student from Kansas City, Kan., said she
wasn't concerned that the Klan would recruit any students.
   ``I'm against the KKK but they do have a right to speak,'' she
said. ``I think a lot of people are here just out of curiosity.''

   Ninety-one junior high school
students were sent to hospitals after a mysterious irritant caused
rashes, blisters and breathing difficulties during physical
education classes, authorities said today.
   Chemicals were ruled out after a grounds check at Rincon Junior
High School on Monday and experts were concentrating on water
contamination as a possible cause, said Diane Ho, a spokeswoman for
the Rowland Unified School District.
   ``It is a mystery,'' said Anastacio Medina, chief of the county
health department's hazardous materials control program.
   All but one of the seventh- and eighth-grade students were
treated and released from hospitals by mid-afternoon, authorities
said. One student, who was not identified, was kept overnight for
observation of an asthmatic condition at Inter-Community Medical
Center in Covina, a nursing supervisor said today.
   Paramedics accompanied students in ambulances and school buses
to the hospitals after the first symptoms were reported Monday
morning, said West Covina police Lt. Clint Collins.
   The 700-student campus is part of the Rowland Unified School
District in West Covina, about 30 miles east of Los Angeles.
   Experts from the San Gabriel Valley Fire Authority, the public
health department, the Department of Agriculture and the Walnut
Water District were called in to find the problem after the
students started reporting swollen eyes, rashes, blisters or
stomach cramps, Ms. Ho said.
   All of the youths had participated in one of three periods of
physical education classes.
   ``We found no chemicals on the playgrounds,'' Ms. Ho said,
adding that a couple of fleas were found in a grassy field area but
none was known to cause such an intense reaction.
   None of the school's teachers or other adult employees
experienced any symptoms, she said.
   The playgrounds were closed to all students after the outbreak
was initially reported, but the rest of the school remained open.

   CBS Inc. Chairman William Paley, who underwent
emergency gall bladder surgery last month, was released from a
hospital today after making a remarkable recovery, a spokeswoman
said.
   Paley, 86, was in critical condition following his Feb. 11
surgery at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.
   Hospital spokeswoman Myrna Manners said Paley had ``remarkably
improved after one month in the hospital,'' and the network's
founder was sent home this morning.
   Paley bought the Columbia Broadcasting System, a fledgling radio
network, in 1928. He controlled it for more than half a century,
turning over the reins in 1983.
   When CBS's biggest stockholder, Loew's Corp., became unhappy
with his successor's policies, Paley teamed with Loew's chairman
Lawrence Tisch to retake control in 1986.

   The Federal Aviation Administration, worried
about a rash of commuter airline accidents that claimed 56 lives
over a recent five-month period, today announced a year-long
inspection of the commuter industry.
   FAA Administrator Allan McArtor said the inspection will cover
173 commuter airlines. Agency inspectors are planning to focus on
about 20 percent of those carriers.
   McArtor said FAA officials already are reviewing ``major problem
areas'' in the industry, which last year carried 30 million
passengers,
   and plan within 60 days to begin inspections.
   Teams of FAA inspectors will focus on such areas as airline
management, training programs, record keeping and aircraft
condition.
   McArtor said the commuter airlines' safety record in recent
months has sharply reversed from the trends seen in recent years.
The FAA cited seven commuter accidents from November through
February in which 56 people were killed.
   The worst accident was that of a Ryan Air commuter Nov. 13 near
Homer, Alaska, in which 18 people died.
   Commuter airlines have played an increasingly important role in
the nation's aviation system because they often are used as feeder
airlines for the major jet carriers at large airports around the
country. Last year the commuters carried nearly 30 million
passengers, according to the Regional Airline Association, and that
number is expected to continue to climb.
   ``We want a return to the 1986 environment when commuters had
the safest year in their history,'' McArtor told a news conference.
In 1986, commuter airlines had just two fatal accidents in which
four people were killed.
   FAA officials said they expect the initial inspection phase of
the commuters to be completed by the end of September. The agency
then will prepare a final report on the findings, which would be
used by inspectors responsible for the individual airlines in
having corrective action taken.

   Divine, the outrageous 300-pound female
impersonator who starred in such cult classics as ``Pink
Flamingos'' and ``Lust in the Dust,'' died at age 42 on the verge
of acceptance as a legitimate character actor, his manager said.
   Divine, whose real name was Harris Glenn Milstead, was a
garishly made up, loud and foul-mouthed character who was
introduced in 1972's ``Pink Flamingos'' as ``the filthiest person
alive.'' Milstead made the same campy character suitable for a
wider audience in the current movie ``Hairspray.''
   ``He was finally getting respect within the industry,'' said
manager Bernard Jay. ``He was getting the legitimate screen and
television offers that showed the industry had finally accepted him
as the very good character actor he always knew he was.''
   Milstead, found in his bed at the Hollywood Regency Plaza Hotel
on Monday, apparently died of asphyxiation in his sleep, said
publicist John West of PMK.
   The Los Angeles County coroner's office said it was
investigating the cause of death.
   Last Friday, a doctor declared Milstead in excellent health,
other than his weight, ``which has been a constant problem
throughout his life,'' said Jay.
   Milstead said in a 1985 interview he grew up fat and was taunted
by classmates in the Baltimore suburb of Lutherville. Milstead told
an interviewer he had a fantasy life revolving around female movie
stars and dreams of becoming a celebrity.
   Milstead was made a celebrity, at least among fans of
after-midnight art films, by one of his few friends from high
school, director John Waters.
   Waters cast Milstead in trashy and bizarre roles as the
female-impersonating star of ``Pink Flamingos,'' ``Lust In The
Dust,'' ``Polyester'' and ``Female Trouble.''
   ``I'd see him waiting for the school bus, wearing different
color hair every morning,'' Waters said in a recent interview with
the Los Angeles Times.
   ``I remembered my father would just flip out. He'd get so
excited. So I thought _ Wow! If Divine can make my father that
crazy, think of how great he'd be in a movie.''
   Despite his dressing in drag for acting roles, Milstead wasn't a
transvestite at heart, Waters wrote in his book, ``Shock Value.''
``He says he sometimes dreads getting into drag but realizes these
flamboyant outfits are his `work clothes,''' Waters wrote.
   With each film, Waters and Milstead found a wider audience. The
Waters-directed ``Hairspray,'' a spoof of the 1960s, was rated No.
16 last weekend in the box office, earning $577,258 at 79 theaters.
   West said Milstead was in Los Angeles to appear in an episode of
the Fox Television Network series ``Married ... With Children.''
   Milstead was to have appeared in that series dressed as a man,
as he did playing a Sydney Greenstreet-type character in the 1985
film ``Trouble In Mind.''
   In ``Hairspray,'' Milstead played dual roles. In men's clothing,
he was a television station operator determined to keep black and
white youngsters from appearing together on a dance show. As
Divine, he starred as the stage mother of a chubby, teen-age dance
show contestant.
   ``The character is a real person,'' Milstead once said of
Divine. ``Sometimes she's just too bold, but she has socially
redeeming qualities, no matter what she does. She's her own person
and a lot of people like that. The camp element is something out of
the ordinary, this big man playing a sexy woman.''
   Besides film roles, Milstead also used the Divine persona in a
nightclub act.
   Milstead is survived by his mother and father, Frances and
Harris Milstead, of Florida, West said. Funeral arrangements were
pending.

<TEXT>
   Militant Roman Catholics rioted
through the night and into the early morning over the killing of
three unarmed Irish guerrillas in Gibraltar. The Irish government
said it was ``gravely perturbed'' at the shootings.
   Youths in Belfast pelted police with gasoline bombs and set
ablaze several dozen automobiles in rioting that lasted into early
today, police said. No injuries were reported.
   It was one of the worst nights of violence in the British-ruled
province since last summer, and was touched off by the shooting of
two men and a woman Sunday in Britain's fortress colony on Spain's
southern coast.
   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said Monday that a
``dreadful terrorist act has been averted'' by the slayings.
   ``The three people killed were actively involved in the planning
and attempted execution of that act,'' he told the House of Commons
in London.
   Police in Gibraltar said the three were believed to be involved
in an Irish Republican Army plan to detonate a car bomb at the
governor's residence during a ceremonial changing of the guard
today.
   Fifty members of the Royal Anglian Regiment, just transferred
from duty in Northern Ireland, took part in the ceremony which
occurred without incident.
   Security was heavy as Gibraltar police and British troops with
dogs patrolled the fringes of a crowd of about 300 tourists and
residents who watched the colorful ceremony in front of The
Convent, official residence of Governor Sir Peter Terry.
   The IRA, which is fighting a guerrilla war to drive the British
from Northern Ireland, acknowledged that the three guerrillas were
on a mission but accused the British government of needlessly
killing them.
   In Dublin, Prime Minister Charles Haughey's government said it
recognized the need for security forces ``to take all reasonable
measures to combat terrorism.''
   ``The government is, however, gravely perturbed that three
unarmed Irish people should have been shot dead ... when it appears
from reports that they could have been arrested by the security
forces,'' the government said.
   Ireland is already embroiled in a series of disputes with
Britain over security forces in Northern Ireland, including
Britain's unwillingness to prosecute police officers who allegedly
carried out a shoot-to-kill policy in the province.
   Howe said the soldiers opened fire after the guerrillas parked a
Renault-5 with Spanish license plates near the governor's residence
and headed on foot for the Spanish border 800 yards away.
   Howe said the three guerrillas ``made movements which led
security personnel to believe their lives were in danger.''
   Police searched Gibraltar and adjacent Spanish territory on
Monday for another car believed connected with the three. The
theory is the Renault-5 was reserving a space for a car bomb.
   Howe said Spanish police tipped off the British after a fourth
IRA guerrilla they were watching crossed into Gibraltar, apparently
to carry out ``reconnaissance for an act of terrorism.''
   The London newspaper the Daily Mail said Spanish police believe
the fourth suspect may be Evelyn Glenholmes, who has been linked
with several IRA attacks in past years. It quoted them as saying a
women of her description was seen visiting the other three at an
apartment in Malaga, two hours' drive from Gibraltar.
   Howe said a car for which the three slain guerrillas had keys
was found parked on the Spanish side of the gate separating this
2.25-square-mile limestone rock from the Spanish mainland. He said
it contained keys to a third car, three false passports and
equipment including an alarm clock, insulating tape and wire that
could be used to detonate a bomb.
   Howe did not identify the British unit involved, but there was
speculation they were from the elite Special Air Services Regiment,
whose movements are secret. Witnesses said they wore jeans.
   The outlawed IRA, in a statement from Belfast, identified the
dead as: Mairead Farrell, 31, who had served 10 years jail for
blowing up a hotel, Sean Savage, 24, and Daniel McCann, 30, both of
whom have been arrested on explosive charges.
   All three were from Catholic West Belfast, where the rioting
broke out after Howe's statement.
   In Belfast, police fired plastic bullets to disperse gangs of
youths who hurled gasoline bombs and set fire to 30 vehicles
including buses, vans and trucks. Gunmen launched at least two
sniper attacks on police and troops, police said.
   The mainly Catholic IRA seeks to drive the British from Northern
Ireland and unite the predominantly Protestant province with the
overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic under socialist rule.

   The mayor has announced his resignation
amid a criminal probe into the handling of client funds in his
private law practice.
   The town council will decide on March 21 whether to appoint a
replacement for Richard Kennett or call a special election. Kennett
also resigned his position as a council member.
   ``Please accept my deepest and most sincere apology for any
embarrassment and adverse publicity which in any way reflects
poorly on our town, its staff or council,'' Kennett said in a
resignation letter dated Friday.
   The letter did not mention a Contra Costa County District
Attorney's investigation into Kennett's practice, officials said.
Kennett has said his attorney has advised him not to comment on the
probe.
   District Attorney Gary Yancey also refused comment because the
case involved an ``ongoing investigation.''
   Kennett's attorney, William Gagen, said at least part of the
investigation stems from checks sent to Debbie Peterson of Spokane,
Wash.
   Peterson had hired Kennett to settle her deceased mother's
estate; the investigation involves checks that allegedly bounced.
   The State Bar of California has ruled in a separate case that
Kennett failed to represent a client in divorce proceedings in a
timely manner, had neglected the case of another client, and had
failed to respond to inquiries from the State Bar about these
complaints.
   That ruling is going to the State Bar's review panel for a
recommendation on disciplinary action.
   Kennett, 49, was elected to the Danville Town Council in
November 1985 and was named by fellow council members to a one-year
mayor's term last December. Danville is a suburban town of 7,000
about 20 miles east of San Francisco.

<TEXT>
   A confident George Bush cast his ballot in the
Texas primary today, saying ``I'm encouraged'' about his prospects
in the Super Tuesday Republican presidential contests.
   ``I'm not making any predictions,'' Bush told reporters as he
prepared to go into a hotel polling place west of the downtown area.
   Standing with his wife, Barbara, beside his limousine under
threatening skies, Bush said, ``If we exceed our expectations or
live up to them, I think we'll be in good shape.''
   Top campaign aides had said earlier that they thought Bush stood
a good chance of winning at least 12 or 13 state contests today.
   As Bush prepared to await the returns here and in 16 other
states, his aides were getting ready for a series of campaign
strategy sessions Wednesday.
   A principal focus of those sessions will be how to continue the
vote-getting momentum as the competition moves to Illinois and
other states in the Midwest.
   Asked today if he had gained ``Big Mo'' over his opponents, Bush
replied, ``I never use that expression since 1980. I've learned
since then.''
   After upsetting Ronald Reagan in the 1980 Iowa caucuses Bush
claimed he had achieved ``Big Mo.'' But then he went on to lose to
Reagan in New Hampshire and subsequently pulled out of the race.
   ``I'm encouraged,'' Bush said today when asked how well he would
do. ``But regardless of what happens here, the battle goes right on
to Illinois.''
   At his last public appearance on Monday, in Rogers, Ark., Bush
said he was ``optimistic but not overconfident.''
   Asked what he'd do if he didn't win today, he replied: ``I'll
have to do what I did when I got kicked in Iowa _ get up off the
canvas, go out and fight hard.'' After his third-place finish in
Iowa, Bush went on to a solid win in the New Hampshire primary
eight days later.
   After a day of campaigning in Arkansas, Missouri and Oklahoma,
Bush flew to his adopted hometown to vote in the Texas primary and
await the results.
   But his top campaign aides and leading Southern strategists said
they wouldn't be surprised if the vice president captured some 600
of the roughly 700 delegates at stake.
   Such a scenario, said campaign manager Lee Atwater, could
present Republican presidential rival Bob Dole with a must-win
scenario in next week's Illinois primary.
   ``I don't know what Dole does if he doesn't win Illinois,''
Atwater said. A Dole campaign source agreed that the Kansas senator
has to win Illinois and said the campaign is prepared to spend
$500,000 on advertising there.
   Bush seemed tired, but upbeat, as he toured an American Airlines
maintenance facility at Tulsa's airport.
   ``The person that clearly wins Super Tuesday is going to be the
nominee of the party and, I think, the next president,'' he said.
``It's critical.''
   But Bush brushed aside talk of a sweep. ``You always wish for
that, but I certainly would never predict that. It's too much for
anyone to expect.''
   Atwater said he expected Bush to win 12 or 13 of the 17 GOP
events, and deputy campaign manager Rich Bond said the campaign is
prepared to spend ``whatever it takes'' to win Illinois.
   Bush returned to Houston almost five months from the day he
declared his presidential candidacy here, saying ``I mean to run
hard and I mean to win.''
   Bush is a native of Massachusetts and was raised in Connecticut,
but he moved here with his wife, Barbara, in 1948, to learn the oil
business. He became a successful oilman before venturing into
politics as a county Republican chairman.
   ``I'm guardedly optimistic'' about Bush's chances in Texas,
state campaign political Kevin Moomaw said. ``Bob Dole's campaign
in Texas is non-existent. The competition in this state has been
Pat Robertson.''
   Moomaw said not even the forecast of heavy rains through much of
Texas would put a damper on Bush's prospects.
   ``We are warning everybody to go out and vote,'' he said.
``There is a potential for a turnout of 750,000.''
   Ken Wright, Bush's Florida campaign director, said ``we're
looking good. I'd like to see us come out with 70 of the 82
delegates. I think we're going to do very, very well.''
   Bush got a lift with his lopsided victory in South Carolina's
primary on Saturday. He had stumbled out of the starting gate,
finishing behind Dole and Robertson in Iowa. But Bush bounced back
to win by a comfortable margin in New Hampshire, and has done well
since, although he did not compete in Minnesota and withdrew from
South Dakota a week before losing that contest to Dole.

<TEXT>
   Two former leaders of a strict religious
group have surrendered their passports and agreed to stay in the
United States pending trial on charges involving the death of a
10-year-old diabetic boy.
   Doug Kleber and Jeffrey Siegel, both of Champaign, Ill., posted
$2,500 bond after being charged with second-degree criminal
mistreatment and were released from the Spokane County Jail Monday,
officials said.
   Kleber, former national leader of the so-called ``No Name
Fellowship,'' and Siegel, former head elder of the Spokane branch,
are among seven people being investigated in the Dec. 20 death of
Aaron Norman. An autopsy determined the boy died from untreated
juvenile diabetes.
   At issue is whether the Normans and church leaders knew the boy
was seriously ill but withheld medical care because of their
religious beliefs. Leaders have said the church believes in the
power of prayer, and former members say the church distrusts
doctors and institutionalized medicine.
   The boy's parents, Bob and Judith Norman, are being investigated
for homicide by abuse, said county Deputy Prosecutor Clark Colwell.
   The Normans did not seek medical help prior to the child's
death, but contacted church leaders after trying unsuccessfully to
revive the boy using cardiopulmonary resuscitation, according to
sheriff's deputies.
   The boy was disciplined by spanking on the advice of church
leaders the day before he died, authorities say. A pathologist
determined the spanking did not contribute to the boy's death but
said bruises were found on his buttocks and legs.
   Kleber has said that neither he nor the Normans knew the boy was
seriously ill and that they would have taken him to a doctor if
they had known.
   The Normans have been members of the Spokane fellowship since it
started in in 1981, but the branch announced last weekend it had
disbanded.
   Since the boy's death, the Normans' youngest son, 8-year-old
David, has been put in foster care by state officials.
   Three others charged with criminal mistreatment are Mark Roloff,
33, the head elder of the former Spokane branch, and church members
John Johnson, 37, and Steve Arden of Spokane, Colwell said.
   Arraignment for all defendants will be scheduled in the next
several weeks in Superior Court, officials said.
   The church said it has about 200 members in Spokane; Champaign;
Plano, Texas; and Passaic, N.J. It was formed in the 1970s in
Illinois primarily as a Bible-study group for athletes.

   An opposition spokesman said riot police
clashed today with hundreds of student protesters in Krakow, while
at Warsaw University thousands of students demonstrated peacefully
to demand greater academic freedom.
   About 70 to 100 people were detained in Krakow, but police began
releasing them by early afternoon, opposition activist Zygmunt
Lenyk said. He said at least three people were severely beaten by
police.
   The demonstrations coincided with the anniversary of March 8,
1968, student protests at Warsaw University against censorship and
political repression, which were brutally broken up by police and
Communist Party worker activists.
   This year's protests reflected a renewed campaign by student
activists urging Communist authorities to legalize the Independent
Students Union, known as NZS, which was outlawed following the
December 1981 martial law crackdown on the independent labor
federation Solidarity.
   At Krakow's Jagiellonian University, about 700 students tried to
march to the main square in the city's Old Town following a noon
campus rally organized by the NZS, but found the street cordoned
off by police, Lenyk said.
   Lenyk, quoting eyewitness accounts, said police attacked the
crowd with clubs, but some demonstrators pushed their way through
police lines to reach the square, where they were detained.
   He said most of the students returned to campus and tried twice
more to march to the square, about 500 yards away, but each time
were attacked by police.
   A government spokesman, asked about the reported clash and
violence, said he had no information and promised to look into the
matter.
   At Warsaw University, police did not intervene as more than
2,000 students peacefully demonstrated without leaving campus.
   Students and university workers, carrying dozens of banners
demanding legalization of the NZS and Solidarity free trade union,
marched to a campus carrying a plaque commemorating the 1968
protests.
   The plaque was put up in March 1981 when both Solidarity and the
NZS functioned legally.
   University authorities allowed the rally, but the campus' main
gates were locked and security guards kept non-university personnel
from entering.
   After students and faculty members laid wreaths under the
plaque, campus NZS leaders stood on top of a wall to take turns
speaking to the crowd through a bullhorn.

   A judge had refused to allow the release of
FBI surveillance records tracking the political activities of late
Beatle John Lennon because their disclosure could compromise
national security.
   The request for release of Lennon's FBI dossier was made by
University of California, Irvine, professor Jon Wiener under the
Freedom of Information Act. Wiener said he will appeal the ruling
by U.S. District Judge Robert Takasugi.
   The decision came in response to a 1983 lawsuit filed by Wiener
when the FBI released only part of Lennon's file, which contains
documents about the musician's anti-war activities in the 1970s.
   ``They claimed some of these documents would damage national
security,'' Wiener said. ``To me, it sounds like a ridiculous thing
to say about 18-year-old documents about the political activities
of a dead rock star.''
   Lennon was murdered outside his New York City apartment in 1980.
   The ruling came last week after a closed-doors meeting between
Takasugi and government attorneys.

   Actor Robert Livingston, who rode the range
in dozens of movies and was the only Lone Ranger to remove his
mask, has died. He was 83.
   Livingston, who died at his Tarzana home Monday, had been
battling emphysema, and was seriously ill for the last eight
months, said his publicist, Samuel M. Sherman.
   When Livingston appeared in the 1939 movie ``The Lone Ranger
Rides Again,'' Republic Pictures had him remove the mask briefly so
that he would be associated in the public's mind as the Lone
Ranger, said Livingston's son Addison Randall.
   Actor Clayton Moore played the Lone Ranger on radio and
television.
   Born Robert E. Randall in 1904, in Quincy, Ill., Livingston
chose a stage name rather than compete with his younger brother
Addison ``Jack'' Randall, who later was killed in a screen accident.
   As Stoney Brooke, one of the ``Three Mesquiteers,'' Livingston
rode the range with two cowboy pals through 29 of the Republic
Pictures films. When he left for other roles, his replacement was a
then little known actor named John Wayne, said Sherman.
   His other films included ``The Bold Caballero,'' 1937; ``Mutiny
on the Bounty,'' with Clark Gable, 1935; ``Pistol Packin' Mama,''
1943; ``Daredevils of the Clouds,'' his last picture for Republic,
1948; ``Once Upon a Horse,'' 1958, and ``Blazing Steweardesses,
1975.
   Funeral services will be private.

   Contra leader Adolfo Calero said today
that the rebels would not attend cease-fire negotiations the
Sandinista government had scheduled to begin Wednesday in Nicaragua.
   Calero said in a telephone interview from Miami that government
officials talked to the rebel leaders on Monday ``at the last
minute'' to tell them ``that they were ready for a meeting.''
   ``Apparently what the Sandinista government wants is a
unilateral show...,'' he said. ``We are not willing to attend a
unilateral meeting set up by the Sandinistas.''
   Three days of talks were to be held at the frontier post of
Sapoa, about 90 miles from the capital of Managua along the
southern border with Costa Rica.
   Calero said the rebels may agree to hold talks at a later date
in Sapoa.
   He complained the government had not responded to a statement
the rebels issued last week calling for Cardinal Miguel Obando y
Bravo to continue participating in the talks as a witness and for
the talks to center on wider issues than just arrangements for a
cease-fire between the warring sides.
   President Daniel Ortega proposed the talks last week. He also
said Obando y Bravo, head of the Roman Catholic Church in
Nicaragua, would no longer serve as a mediator as he had in
previous discussions.
   Ortega said the government delegation to the talks would be
headed by his brother, Humberto Ortega, the defense minister and
one of nine members on the ruling National Directorate.
   The Contras named Calero to head their delegation, but insisted
that the cardinal be a witness at the meeting.
   Late Monday, the government said Obando y Bravo and Joao Baena
Soares, secretary general of the Organization of American States,
had agreed to serve as witnesses.
   The government maintains the talks should focus on the laying
down of arms as outlined in the regional peace plan signed last
August by the presidents of Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala,
Costa Rica and Honduras.
   The rebels want the discussions to be expanded to include a
proposal put forth last month in Guatemala City by the cardinal.
   Obando y Bravo's agenda called for the government to grant total
amnesty to political prisoners, review a mandatory military draft
law, allow full press freedom and renew a dialogue with its
internal opposition. In return for the concessions, the Contras
were to accept a 30-day cease-fire.
   The U.S.-backed rebels have been fighting against the Sandinista
government since November 1981.

   ``The hermit of Chestnut Hill,'' who lived in
makeshift huts on government land for nearly two decades and
resisted well-publicized efforts to relocate him, died the way he
would have wanted, says a friend.
   ``He died free, so to speak,'' said Clyde Raymond. ``He had his
own drummer and stuck with it.''
   Bill Britt, 52, had been dead for several months when he was
found Monday by two of his three childen, Ingrid Boughner of
Belmont and Britton Steven Boughner of Medford, Boston police
spokesman Scott Gillis.
   His body, dressed in multiple layers of clothing, was almost
skeletal because of decomposition and animals, Gillis said.
   Dr. Stanton Kessler of the Suffolk County Medical Examiner's
office said today that autopsy results showed Britt died of
hypothermia. He said identification of the body was
``presumptive,'' because rats had eaten away most of Britt's face
and other exposed areas.
   Kessler said Britt's feet were found dug into the ground, as if
to gain some warmth.
   Born Britton William Boughner in wealthy Chestnut Hill, Britt
had lived on nearby land controlled by the Metropolitan District
Commission since 1969. His hut was about 30 feet inside the fence
surrounding Evergreen Cemetery, in the area of a large reservoir on
the Boston-Brookline border.
   ``In his case, he felt that this was where he wanted to live,
this was his estate,'' said Raymond.
   In 1985, officials started trying to move Britt, who was legally
blind and lived on money from collecting cans and bottles for the
deposits. When he refused welfare and several attempts to relocate
him to public or subsidized housing, the news media dubbed him
``the hermit on Chestnut Hill.''
   In May, Britt's plastic and wood wigwam was destroyed in a fire.
He was in New York City at the time appearing on the ``Late Night
with David Letterman'' television show because of the publicity his
case attracted.
   State Appeals Court Judge Edith Fine issued a stay preventing
authorities from removing Britt from the property. But when the
appeals court order expired in July, officials removed his rebuilt
wigwam and his belongings.
   Britt rebuilt it again despite deteriorating health. An
opthalmologist testified at a Housing Court hearing a year ago that
Britt had ulcers and he needed a corneal transplant. Also, Britt
was nearly toothless.
   Last year, he said he was writing a ``Hermit's Cookbook,'' but
the manuscript and other papers relating to his legal battles were
lost in the May fire.

   A Justice Department official today proposed
raising congressional salaries to as much as $175,000 in exchange
for dropping the ``double standard'' that exempts Congress from
federal ethics laws.
   ``I personally am attracted by the idea of raising the salary of
all members of Congress to a level around somewhere between
$150,000 and $175,000 a year,'' Assistant Attorney General William
Weld said in a speech attacking public corruption.
   ``This would enable you to do some other things like prohibit
honoraria,'' added Weld, who is in charge of the department's
criminal division. ``It would be very, very expensive, and ...
worth every penny.''
   Members of the executive branch and independent agencies are
prohibited from supplementing salaries with fees and honoraria for
job-related activities. Violators are subject to up to a year in
prison.
   Congressional salaries are now $89,500 a year, which senators
may supplement with honoraria in an amount not to exceed 40 percent
of their salaries. The percentage for House members is 30 percent.
   Weld said the payment of $2,000 fees to members of Congress who
visited a business establishment over which their committee had
jurisdiction ``would be a laydown criminal case if performed by
somebody in the executive branch.''
   ``You have the double standard (of) criminal acts by one branch
of government'' being legal in another ``and that really is neither
logical nor is it consonant with the notion of fair play,'' Weld
said in remarks at the National Press Club.
   He said raising congressional salaries and applying the ban on
outside payments would end ``any risk that these fees or honoraria
would be influencing a legislator's sense of how to spend his time,
much less his vote.'' Higher salaries might attract talented people
who otherwise would be unable to afford being in Congress.
   In response to questions, he rejected the suggestion that his
comments were an attempt to overshadow the fact that a number of
Reagan administration officials are under criminal investigation or
have been convicted of crimes.
   ``My remarks today are the same as remarks I've been giving ...
since 1978,'' said Weld, a former U.S. attorney in Boston and a
former candidate for state attorney general in Massachusetts.
   Weld's boss, Attorney General Edwin Meese III, is under
investigation in the Wedtech scandal and in connection with a $1
billion proposed Iraqi pipeline project that may have involved
planned payoffs to the Israeli Labor Party.
   Weld also criticized Congress for excluding itself from coverage
of conflict-of-interest laws, which former White House political
director Lyn Nofziger was convicted last month of violating on
behalf of scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. and two other clients.
   The assistant attorney general noted the lack of restrictions on
lobbying by former congressmen.
   ``The day after a congressman leaves office, he is free to lobby
his former colleagues on behalf of himself or his friends or
clients, while continuing to enjoy full access to the House and
Senate floors,'' said Weld. ``As recent events have made abundantly
clear, such behavior by a former member of the executive branch
would land one in jail.''
   Nofziger, under the 1978 Ethics in Government Act, was found
guilty of lobbying his former agency within one year after he left
the government on matters in which the agency had been
substantially involved.
   The matters pertained to a federal contract for Wedtech, the
continued production of A10 anti-tank aircraft and civilian manning
of Navy ships.
   Nofziger faces sentencing later this month.

comment from Gay Men's Health Crisis</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   AIDS experts have sharply criticized a book by
the sex experts Dr. William Masters and Virginia Johnson that
claims to find wide spread of AIDS among heterosexuals.
   ``They have not done even the most rudimentary things to
establish any representativeness of their results,'' says Dr. June
Osborn, a virologist, pediatrician and dean of the school of public
health at the University of Michigan.
   In the book, released Monday and titled ``Crisis: Heterosexual
Behavior in the Age of AIDS,'' Masters and Johnson reported finding
a 5 percent AIDS infection rate in men who said they had at least
six sexual partners a year for five years, and a 7 percent
infection rate in similarly active women.
   By comparison, federal figures released in February that cover
the period from 1985 to Sept. 30 show that 5,890 of 3.96 million
military recruits tested positive, a rate of 1.5 cases of AIDS
infection for every 1,000 people tested.
   Based on their study of 800 people, Masters and Johnson
concluded: ``The AIDS virus has certainly established a beachhead
in the ranks of heterosexuals, and ... the odds are that the rate
of spread among heterosexuals will now begin to escalate at a
frightening pace.''
   Osborn contended that no such conclusion can be reached because
the 800, including some people recruited with sign-up sheets on
bulletin boards, were not chosen to be representative of the U.S.
population.
   Lori Behrman, spokeswoman for the Manhattan-based Gay Men's
Health Crisis, today called the findings unscientific and expressed
concern that they would harm anti-discrimination efforts.
   ``They have squandered their credibity to exploit a public
health issue,'' said Behrman. ``They have succeeded in alarming the
public and have undone the good work that public officials have
done around the country. You don't raise false alarms around an
issue so potentially explosive as AIDS.''
   Late Monday on ABC-TV's ``Nightline,'' Masters defended the
unscientific sample as a preliminary step, ``raising an alarm''
about the possibility there are heterosexuals outside the known
risk groups who are in danger from the AIDS epidemic.
   ``What we haven't realized is that there is another group of
those heterosexuals who have a very multiplicity-of-partners type
of sex life, and that is all that the experiments demonstrated,''
Masters said.
   Masters denied that at a morning news conference the authors had
backed off the book's claim that AIDS was ``running rampant'' among
heterosexuals.
   ``We think that it is spreading very rapidly in the heterosexual
population. We used the word rampant advisedly, because we think
that we are facing a situation where there is tremendous danger.''
   Dr. Peter Fischinger, AIDS coordinator for the Public Health
Service, disagreed earlier Monday, saying, ``We don't see an
explosion into the heterosexual community.''
   He noted that nationwide screening of blood donors has found
that only about one in 40,000 shows evidence of infection with the
AIDS virus. But he added, ``This does not mean we can be complacent
about it.''
   Mathilde Krim, chairwoman of the American Foundation for AIDS
Research, said, ``Masters and Johnson may have expertise in
sexuality, but they have no credentials to justify their
recommendations concerning AIDS public health policy _
recommendations that will surely alarm the public.''
   Masters and Johnson and their co-author, Dr. Robert Kolodny, a
director of the Masters & Johnson Institute in St. Louis, also
resurrected the nearly universally discarded notion that AIDS can
be spread by casual contact.
   ``It does a disservice to the public to suggest once again that
you can get this from kissing,'' said Dr. Stephen Joseph, New York
City's public health commissioner. The authors also called for
widespread mandatory testing for AIDS, a recommendation that has
been opposed by most public health authorities.
   ``I don't see anything in their own data that would lead one to
make the sweeping statements about casual transmission and
mandatory testing that I think they've made,'' said Joseph.
   At their news conference, Masters, Johnson and Kolodny appeared
to disavow some of the claims they made in the book. Kolodny
acknowledged writing that kissing could spread AIDS, but said under
harsh questioning from reporters that it was only a very small
theoretical possibility.
   Kolodny said today on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' that the
authors had ``carefully worded'' their statements ``to say, for
instance, of the restaurant situation, as a practical matter,
there's no risk.''
   ``But should we be, as scientists, dishonest with the public and
say there's no risk at all, none, when the history of this epidemic
has been that every year new revelations come forth?'' he added.
   Joseph, on CBS' ``This Morning,'' said that he feared a backlash
against ``alarmist and unsupported numbers.''
   ``There is a real threat from heterosexual transmission, it's a
major part of the epidemic, but blowing it out of proportion, as
Masters and Johnson have done, I think will hurt the credibility of
the issue in the end.
   ``With AIDS its not who you are, its what you do. Anyone who
engages in high-risk behavior, any heterosexual person who is a
partner of someone who is in a primary risk group, a bisexual man
or a man who uses IV drugs, is at risk,'' Joseph said.
   Asked at Monday's news conference to back up the book's
statement that ``the AIDS virus is now running rampant in the
heterosexual community,'' Masters said, ``I simply believe this.''
Johnson said, ``I'm not sure we chose the word `rampant'
ourselves.''
   Osborn criticized the authors for being secretive about their
findings. She said Masters and Johnson attended an AIDS workshop at
the Kinsey Institute in Bloomington, Ind., in December and ``they
didn't give any clue that three months later this would come out.''
   ``It does, to me, shake my confidence in their scientific
purpose,'' she said.

   Two former executives of a firm subcontracted
to work on the B-1 bomber pleaded guilty to charges involving a
fraudulent check-cashing scheme and illegal overbilling for time
spent working on the military jet.
   Robert F. Butler, former owner of Butler Industries and Purkey
Co. Inc., and Steven Wooten, former general manager of Butler
Industries, entered their pleas Monday before U.S. District Judge
Stephen V. Wilson.
   The pleas were part of a deal in which the defendants
acknowledged the government's case against them but claimed they
never intended to violate the law, said Butler's attorney, Gerson
S. Horn. The arrangement allows them to present their defense in
any civil litigation arising from the case.
   ``It would have taken a tremendous amount of money to fight this
case,'' Horn said. ``The government threatened to indict more''
unless the plea bargain was accepted.
   One of the three federal grand jury indictments accused both
Butler and Wooten of overbilling Rockwell Inc., the aerospace
contractor on the U.S. Air Force's B-1 bomber, for time spent
changing orders on parts for the bomber.
   Rockwell was billed for 495 hours of work on the subcontract,
445 more than were actually involved, said Assistant U.S. Attorney
J. Stephen Czuleger. The billing amounted to $200,000 in erroneous
charges, government officials said.
   Horn said, however, that several company employees could present
testimony to show that the amount of time devoted to the change
orders was not overestimated.
   The other indictment charged Butler, 54, and Wooten, 30, with
cashing company checks valued at more than $144,000 made out to
fictitious payees over a two-year period. The checks were then
illegally deducted on corporate tax returns as a cost of goods
sold, Czuleger said.
   Butler was indicted in another bogus check-cashing scam of more
than $259,000 involving Purkey Co. Inc.
   Horn said the two men claim they were writing the phony checks
to obtain cash for real business expenses. The company was
habitually overdrawn and would otherwise have been unable to get
the money, he said.
   Butler, who pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy, presenting
false claims to the United States, subscribing to a false corporate
income tax return and assisting in the preparation of a false tax
return, faces a maximum two years in prison and $240,000 in fines.
He will be sentenced June 20.
   Wooten, who pleaded guilty to similar charges in two of the
indictments, faces one year and fines of $130,000. He will be
sentenced April 25.

   U.S. Coast Guard vessels have stopped almost 500
Haitians attempting to enter the United States illegally in the
past three days, a spokesman said today.
   Since Saturday three cutters have intercepted four sailing
vessels crammed with Haitians off the Bahamas, said service
spokesman Luis Diaz.
   The figures in the past three days have almost doubled the
number of Haitians stopped this year, he said, adding the weather
alone could not explain the sudden surge in interdictions.
   ``The seas are calm at the moment, but it definitely has to be
the economic situation in their country,'' said Diaz.
   On Saturday a sailing vessel with 192 people was stopped off
Great Inagua, and since then three other ships have been stopped
near Crooked Island, said Diaz.
   One intercepted today had 90 aboard ``and still counting,'' said
Diaz.
   The 1,186 total since Jan. 1 is running well ahead of last
year's total of 3,556 people caught and returned to Haiti, he said.

   A British relief worker and his Syrian
aide were freed today, five days after being taken captive in south
Lebanon, a Sunni Moslem leader said.
   The Briton, Peter Coleridge, told reporters in the southern port
city of Sidon that there had been ``no kidnapping'' and that he and
Omar Traboulsi were detained because they took photographs without
authorization.
   Mustafa Saad, the Sunni leader whose militia controls Sidon,
said Palestinian guerrillas freed Coleridge, the 44-year-old Middle
East coordinator of the British Oxfam relief agency, and Traboulsi,
a 31-year-old Syrian who is the agency's representative in Lebanon.
They were taken captive Thursday at Sidon's Ein el-Hilweh
Palestinian refugee camp.
   Saad said by telephone that representatives of
Fatah-Revolutionary Council, the radical faction headed by Abu
Nidal, turned the two captives over to him at his house in Sidon at
3:50 p.m.
   The release of Coleridge and Traboulsi leaves 22 foreigners
missing and presumed kidnapped in Lebanon. They are nine Americans,
four Frenchmen, three Britons, one Irishman, one Italian, one West
German, one Indian, and two unidentified men. The longest held is
Terry A. Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Lebanese security sources have said Abu Nidal's guerrillas
seized Coleride and Traboulsi when they saw Coleridge taking
pictures of parts of Ein el-Hilweh.
   ``I made a mistake by not asking for a permission (to shoot
pictures) from the authority in Ein el-Hilweh,'' Coleridge told
reporters at Saad's home.
   ``I know and respect the people who took us. There has been no
kidnapping. It was clear from the beginning that I made a mistake.
They were only applying security procedures,'' he said.
   Coleridge, clean-shaven and dressed in dark blue trousers and a
beige jacket, said he ``didn't lose hope'' during his captivity.
   ``We were well treated. We were held at around 4 p.m. Thursday

   Traboulsi did not talk to reporters.
   Today's release came one week after two U.N. relief workers were
freed in southern Lebanon.
   Jan Stening of Sweden and William Jorgensen of Norway had been
abducted near the south Lebanon's provincial capital of Sidon Feb.
5. They were freed March 1.
   Their employer, the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, said today it
would consider resuming some of its activities in the war-torn
country.
   But UNRWA, in a statement released in Vienna, Austria, said it
would not resume full operations in Lebanon without minimum
guarantees of security for its foreign workers there.
   UNRWA cares for Palestinian refugees in the Middle East.

   The Health Ministry declared a meningitis
epidemic Tuesday, saying 20 people have died of the disease in
recent days and 600 are hospitalized.
   Meningitis normally strikes in Sudan every summer, but this year
it began a month earlier than usual early because of unseasonably
early high temperatures. The temperature Tuesday was 111 degrees
Fahrenheit.
   The Health Ministry said Khartoum has been declared an
``epidemic-hit area'' and added the government was using all its
capabilities to deal with the situation.
   It said another 148 cases have been reported from other regions
in Sudan.
   The statement said the disease was widely spread within
overcrowded shanty towns around the capital, where an estimated
750,000 people from southern Sudan are seeking refuge from famine
and civil war in the south.

   Trophy hunters killed a rare Indian
antelope at an animal park with a crossbow, then beheaded it,
police said.
   It was the second such incident since 1983 at the Symbio Animal
Gardens at Stanwell Park south of Sydney, police said Monday.
   ``I suppose they will stick the head on a wall and boast about
it,'' said park owner Bob Grover. ``They probably wanted it because
of its long, spiraling horns.''
   The antelope, named Rajah, was beloved by the thousands of
children who visited each year. The park staff said its mate,
Rajeesh, was pining for its companion.
   Police said the poachers also skinned the animal after shooting
it at close range.

   Thieves tunneled into a jewelry store through the
floor of an adjacent hotel, silenced its alarms and stole $1.6
million in gems, according to a news report.
   Burglars using a blowtorch cut open a safe in the Furst jewelry
store and took out keys that opened a second safe where the jewels
were kept, the Italian news agency ANSA reported Monday.
   The thieves entered the store by cutting a hole in the floor of
the Hotel Majestic that was closed for renovation and silenced the
alarms by cutting telephone lines and pulling one alarm out of the
wall, ANSA said.
   Store owner Manlio Bertucci, 36, said someone tried to break
into the downtown store several years ago by throwing hand grenades
through the front window. He said metal blinds kept the thieves
from getting into the store.

   China has successfully launched into orbit its
22nd satellite, a synchronous communications satellite, it was
reported Tuesday.
   The nationally televised evening news showed a Long March 3
rocket blasting off Monday night from a launch site in Xichuang,
Sichuan province.
   Acting Premier Li Peng, who was shown with military leaders
watching the launch of the telecommunications satellite, later
congratulated scientists and technicians on its success.
   The Long March 3 is China's most sophisticated rocket.
   Reports have said the three-stage rocket's launch capabilities
were nearly doubled last year, and it can now put a payload of 2{
tons into geosynchronous orbit 22,320 miles above Earth.
   China launched its first satellite in 1970 and has recovered all
10 of the retrievable satellites it put into space.
   It began offering launch services for foreign countries last
year. Two U.S. companies have contracted with China to launch
communications satellites this year. China also is to put a
Norwegian satellite into orbit in 1991.

   Deng Yingchao, widow of Premier Chou En-lai and
one of China's most respected women, will resign as head of a
prestigious advisory body, it was reported Tuesday.
   Deng, 84, will be among 600 people who will give up their seats
on the national committee of the China People's Political
Consultative Conference, which will hold its annual session from
March 24, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
   She told a meeting of the conference's Standing Committee the
resignations will revitalize the advisory body, which is made up of
prominent members from the Communist Party, non-Communist groups
and mass organizations.
   The Standing Committee approved a list of 2,081 for the new
national committee, Xinhua said.
   At the age of 21, Deng joined the party and married Chou. She
was one of only about 50 women to complete the 7,750-mile Long
March in 1934-35.
   After Chou's death in 1976, she began to play a more prominent
role in politics, gaining a seat on the policy-making Politburo in
1978.
   Often referred to as China's ``elder sister,'' she and Chou
adopted about 10 war orphans, including acting Premier Li Peng.
   The report did not say who would succeed her.

   West German prosecutors are
investigating more than 1,100 cases of suspected Nazi war crimes,
the country's chief Nazi hunter said Tuesday.
   ``There are still formal investigations of 1,164 persons,'' said
prosecutor Alfred Streim, chief of West Germany's office for Nazi
war crimes investigations.
   Streim's office in the southern city of Ludwigsburg also has
checked out 18,000 names on a list of possible war crimes suspects
received from the United Nations War Crimes Commission archives in
1986, the statement said.
   In January, Streim said he had added 10 prosecutors to his staff
to help with the increased workload in investigating 4,500 war
crimes suspects from the U.N. list. The rest of the suspects had
either died, or had been cleared or convicted in previous trials.
   According to federal statistics, 91,481 people have been
investigated by West German officials since the end of World War
II, with 6,482 ending in convictions. Of those, 12 were sentenced
to death, 160 to life imprisonment, and the rest to lesser
punishment, the statement said.

   Former Mayor Dianne Feinstein would stand a
good chance of winning the Democratic nomination for governor in
1990, according to a California Poll released Tuesday.
   The poll showed Feinstein leading Attorney General John Van de
Kamp, state schools Superintendent Bill Honig and Controller Gary
Davis among registered Democrats questioned.
   None of the Democrats has announced plans for 1990, and Gov.
George Deukmejian, a Republican, has not said if he will seek a
third term.
   Feinstein had the support of 47 percent of Democrats in Northern
California and 25 percent in Southern California. She was the first
pick of 34 percent statewide.
   Van de Kamp was the favorite of 34 percent of Southern
California Democrats, 13 percent in the north and 26 percent
statewide. Honig was picked by 12 percent statewide and Davis by 10
percent.
   The poll found that Feinstein was the choice of 42 percent of
all registered voters while Deukmejian was favored by 48 percent.
Ten percent of those questioned were undecided.
   The survey of 769 registered voters was conducted Feb. 17-21 and
has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 percent. The Democratic
gubernatorial preference of 356 registered Democrats had an error
margin of plus or minus 5.2 percent.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo's ruling party
rammed its version of a new election law through the National
Assembly on Tuesday with an impromptu voice vote, clearing the way
for crucial legislative elections.
   After the law was passed during an unruly assembly session that
drew shouts of outrage from opposition lawmakers, officials of the
ruling Democratic Justice Party said National Assembly elections
would be held about April 20.
   The two sides squabbled over the legislation for hours when Vice
National Assembly Speaker Chang Sung-man, protected by guards, went
to the podium, called for a voice vote and quickly declared the
bill passed.
   Opposition lawmakers tried to block the move but were caught off
guard. Some rushed the podium but were stopped by guards. A brief
scuffle broke out between ruling and opposition lawmakers, but
nobody was hurt.
   ``It is regrettable that the assembly could not proceed
smoothly, although we made concessions up until the last minute,''
said Democratic Justice Party spokesman You Kyung-hyun.
   You said his party had to pass the bill before the current
assembly session ended Tuesday in order to hold the general
elections by April 28, the legal deadline. He said at least 35 days
are needed to prepare.
   But Kim Tae-ryong, spokesman for tMinister Wu Xueqian, said the United
States and China
``have a very cordial relationship between ... and we want to
continue it.''
   As the two leaders posed for pictures in the Oval Office, a
reporter asked Reagan if he would urge China to stop selling
Silkworm missiles to Iran. ``We're going to be talking about a
great many things,'' Reagan replied.
   When the reporter asked if their talks would involve the
Silkworms, Reagan replied, ``You know the rules,'' apparently
suggesting that reporters should not ask questions.
   Wu met Monday with Secretary of State George P. Shultz and with
Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci.
   During toasts following a State Department luncheon on Monday,
Shultz and Wu hailed the progress in bilateal relations and made
almost no reference to issues dividing them.
   Chief among those issues is China's reported sales of military
weaponry to Iran in defiance of U.S. efforts at the United Nations
to win support for a worldwide arms embargo against Iran.
   The administration has been seeking assurances from China that
it will not veto an embargo resolution.
   Last October, the United States retaliated against China for
selling Silkworm anti-ship missiles to Iran by suspending the
process under which China had been given increasing access to U.S.
products with advanced technology.
   Since then, China has said it has stopped selling Silkworms to
Iran.
   Shultz made no reference in his remarks to recent anti-Chinese
rioting in Tibet. State Department spokesman Charles Redman said
between three and nine people are believed to have been killed, and
he expressed deep concern over the human rights situation in Tibet.

   A man who claims he was bitten by a
black widow spider during a church bingo game has sued the church.
   Kevin W. Leonard is suing Holy Spirit Catholic Church for
$1,004.91 in medical bills, $67 in lost wages and an unspecified
amount for physical pain and mental anguish.
   Leonard said he was bitten on the lower leg as he sat at a bingo
table last June. A doctor later diagnosed the bite as having come
from a black widow spider, according to Matt Parmenter, Leonard's
attorney.
   The spider's venom can affect the central nervous system,
although it is generally not fatal to adults.
   The suit claims negligence on the part of the church and the
diocese.
   The Rev. Patrick Foster, pastor of Holy Spirit, declined to
comment on the suit, filed Friday in Vanderburgh Superior Court.

   Officials also received promises of an additional $100,000

the former Texas School Book Depository building.
   ``We are halfway home,'' former Dallas County Judge David Fox, a
co-chairman of the fund drive, said Monday. Fox said officials
expect to raise the remaining money within the next four months.
   County officials announced they would form a committee to begin
the process of having the Dealey Plaza area designated a national
historic landmark.
   Last week, commissioners approved spending $2.3 million in
county funds for constructing an outside elevator, to be used to
carry visitors to the sixth floor, where Lee Harvey Oswald was
believed to have perched on the day of the Kennedy assassination,
Nov. 22, 1963.

   A man driving his four grandchildren to a
family reunion hit a tractor-trailer rig, causing a four-vehicle
pileup and fire that killed him, the children and his wife,
officials said.
   The death toll of seven also included another woman who was
driving a pilot truck behind the tractor-trailer on the narrow,
twisting section of U.S. 93 near this remote western Arizona
community on Monday, authorities said.
   The children's mother, Susan E. Stone, 24, of Las Vegas, was the
only occupant of the motor home to survive the crash. She was taken
to a hospital in nearby Kingman for treatment of shock.
   Stone's husband was driving ahead of the motor home and was not
injured, officials said.
   Investigators at the scene found the dead burned beyond
recognition, said Sgt. Allan Schmidt of the state Department of
Public Safety.
   Jim Bell, an engineer for the Hualapai Fire District, said the
Glovers and Stones were en route from Nevada to a family reunion in
Phoenix.
   Schmidt said investigators determined that the motor home was
southbound on U.S. 93 when it apparently swerved off the right side
of the highway, over-corrected and came back onto the roadway and
struck the trailer portion of the northbound semi-truck.
   The motor home then hit the pilot pickup truck, pushing the
pickup back into a fourth vehicle that was following behind it,
said Schmidt. The motor home, pickup and the fourth vehicle then
burst into flames.
   Schmidt said the driver of the fourth vehicle escaped injury, as
did the driver of the tractor-trailer rig.
   U.S. 93, part of the most direct route between Phoenix and Las
Vegas, Nev., was not completely reopened to traffic until early
today.
   The six occupants of the motor home who were killed have been
identified as Omer L. Glover, 63; his wife, Hazel F. Glover, 62;
and their grandchildren, Elizabeth A. Stone, 8; Justin M. Stone, 5;
Trevor J. Stone, 2; and Kyle A. Stone, 1 month, all of Las Vegas,
Nevada, authorities said.
   Also killed was Verda Noble, 57, of Phoenix, the driver of the
pilot truck.

   Students at Gallaudet University boycotted
classes today to protest the naming of a hearing person as
president of the nation's only university for the deaf. Some
classes were canceled; others were sparsely attended.
   The boycott was called after the students, who had closed the
school Monday by blocking entrances to the campus, were told by
police that they would be arrested if they refused to open the
gates.
   ``We're going to boycott until we get what we want _ a deaf
president,'' said Tim Rarus, a student protest leader.
   Several faculty members supported the students, including the
chairman of the school's mathematics department, Herbert Mapes, who
stayed away from his scheduled classes.
   ``I'm behind the students 100 percent,'' he told a reporter.
   About 250 of the students, instructors and administrators
boycotting normal school activities crowded into a campus
auditorium to reiterate their demand that a deaf president be named.
   But the woman whose appointment as Gallaudet's president
triggered the demonstrations said today she had no intention of
rejecting the offer.
   ``I'm committed to taking the job and I'm committed to the
university,'' Elizabeth Ann Zinser said on ``CBS This Morning.''
   Asked about the continuing protests, she said:
   ``I believe we can overcome that conflict, but I understand and
can appreciate the sentiments of some of the students and friends
of the university at this time learning that their seventh
president is not deaf.''
   Students had blocked entrances to the university Monday but
changed tactics late Monday after police told them their cars would
be ticketed and towed, and any protesters interfering would be
arrested, according to Rarus.
   The university was officially open today, but administration
officials said no policy had been set on whether students would be
penalized for boycotting classes.
   ``Class attendance policies are determined on an individual
basis,'' said provost Catherine Ingold. ``It will be up to each
teacher to decide whether to do anything.''
   Zinser, an administrator at the University of North Carolina at
Greensboro, was selected over two deaf finalists. After her
appointment as president of the nation's only liberal arts college
for the deaf, hundreds of chanting students marched through
downtown Washington, with stops at the White House and the Capitol,
to protest the decision.
   Monday, students swarmed at the gates of the campus before dawn
and refused to let professors and administrators in, forcing
officials to cancel classes for the day. In the afternoon, about
1,800 of the school's 2,200 students again protested at the Capitol.
   Trustees including board chairwoman Jane Bassett Spilman met
with a group of students, faculty and staff for three hours Monday,
but emerged from the meeting sticking by their original decision to
hire Zinser.
   Students had demanded the replacement of Zinser with a deaf
leader, Spilman's resignation, and moves to make deaf persons a
majority on the school's 20-member board of trustees. The board now
has only four deaf members.
   Spilman told a gathering of about 2,000 students that the
board's decision had followed a ``careful, reasoned'' search
process.
   ``A lawful, proper and final decision was made,'' Spilman said.
She left a short while later without taking questions from
reporters.
   Zinser, who does not speak sign language but has promised to
learn, said in a telephone interview from Greensboro that she
understands the students' desire for a deaf president but that she
believes they will eventually come to accept her. She also said she
will maintain some ``distance'' from the school until emotions
subside.
   Covell said students are concentrating their protests on Capitol
Hill, because Gallaudet, created by an act of Congress in 1864,
receives most of its operating budget from the federal government.
In fiscal 1988, Gallaudet is receiving $62 million from Congress.
   ``We're trying to put some pressure on Congress, to get them to
put some pressure on our board,'' said Covell.
   ``She doesn't even sign. What does that tell you?'' said student
Dean Prentice, 21, of Garden City, Kan. ``We need a deaf person as
a role model.''

   Five youngsters were arrested for allegedly
stealing dozens of stuffed cats and peddling them in a shopping
center parking lot.
   Police believe the five children, aged 10 to 13, stole dozens of
Garfield the Cat dolls from a store Sunday. The youths were spotted
outside a shopping center selling the $20 dolls for $2 to $3,
police said.
   In recent months, there have been numerous reports of Garfield
thefts, mostly from car windows, where the doll's paws are attached
with suction cups.
   ``It's some kind of fad,'' said Lt. Rico Castro of the San
Fernando Police Department. ``But I don't get it. It seems pretty
silly.''
   Los Angeles police Detective Robert Uber said police were called
to the Panorama Mall on Sunday after security guards detained the
boys. The guards had watched them sell the dolls and then enter a
department store, where they tried to take $171 worth of clothing,
Uber said.
   The boys were placed in the custody of juvenile authorities.
   Last month, three teen-agers were arrested in North Hollywood
for 30 similar thefts. Police said those suspects had stolen the
dolls for their girlfriends.
   Meanwhile, a Garfield belonging to Los Angeles County Deputy
District Attorney Pamela Davis-Springer was cat-napped Monday from
her pickup truck.

   Weeping Armenians gathered in a snowy cemetery in
Moscow on Tuesday to exchange tales of brutal beatings and deaths
in a southern city torn by ethnic mob violence.
   Their accounts, which often elicited cries of anger from the 300
listeners, could not be verified independently, but were typical of
stories that have been circulating in Armenian communities since
the Feb. 28 rioting in the city of Sumgait in the republic of
Azerbaijan.
   The unrest in Sumgait was triggered by protests in the republic
of Armenia demanding that a region given to neighboring Azerbaijan
in 1923 be shifted to Armenian control. The population of the
Nagorno-Karabakh district is more than three-quarters Armenian.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, has said that 31 people
were killed in Sumgait, which has an Armenian minority. Soviet
officials have refused to elaborate on what happened and
Moscow-based journalists have been barred from traveling to the
Caucasus region.
   There have been many reports by Armenian activists of high death
tolls and brutality against Armenians by Azeris, members of the
dominant ethnic group in Azerbaijan. The Azeris are predominantly
Shiite Moslem, while the Armenians are predominantly Christian.
   The tearful crowd gathered in front of a brick church in the
Armenian section of Moscow's Vagankovskoye Cemetery. Plainclothes
police watched but did not try to break up the meeting, which
lasted two hours.
   One distraught man said he saw a pregnant woman and her unborn
baby slain and mutilated in Sumgait. At the local Communist Party
headquarters, he said, he saw people who were covered with knife
wounds and who had their ears cut off.
   The gray-haired man left without giving his name.
   The meeting began with a moment of silence for women slain in
Sumgait. A priest clad in black asked members of the crowd who had
witnessed anti-Armenian violence to come forward to speak.
   A resident of a village near Sumgait said bands of Azeris had
roved through his settlement, looking under beds for Armenian
children and raping Armenian women. Another Armenian said young
children had been thrown from windows.
   Ambartsum Galestyan, deputy chairman of the committee that
organized last month's protests in Yerevan, Armenia's capital, said
33 people had been killed in the Sumgait rioting.
   They included two Azeris, Galestyan said. He said the Azeris had
been killed by military units brought in to restore order, and that
eight soldiers had been killed. He said 100 to 150 people were
seriously injured.
   Galestyan said 4- and 5-year-old children had been thrown out of
fifth-floor windows by mobs in Sumgait, an industrial city of more
than 160,000 people. The Yerevan resident did not say how he had
learned of the attacks on the children or whether they had been
killed, and it was not clear whether he had been in Sumgait.
   A villager who lives near Sumgait said four people in his
settlement were slain. The villager, who did not give his name,
said he did not know where his family or sister were. ``I fear for
their safety,'' he told the meeting.
   Some speakers were angry at Soviet state-run press and
television, which blamed ``extremists'' for the dispute over
Nagorno-Karabakh and never clearly linked the violence in Sumgait
to antagonisms between Armenians and Azeris.
   ``How can the Soviet media today be silent, under conditions of
openness and restructuring?'' asked Robert Aryanpetyan, a
specialist in history who lives in Moscow. ``Shame on the central
television.''

   John Zaccaro Jr., who was arrested on drug
charges about a year after his mother's vice presidential bid, says
working with runaways has shown him that everyone deserves a second
chance.
   ``I've learned that everyone deserves a second chance, or a
third and fourth chance, however many it may take,'' Zaccaro, son
of Geraldine Ferraro, wrote in the March 29 issue of Woman's Day
magazine about his volunteer work with Covenant House.
   ``My problems are nothing compared to the kids I see on the
streets; when I ran into trouble, my family was there,'' said
Zaccaro, 23, who was arrested for sale and possession of drugs in
February 1984, while a student at Middlebury College in Vermont.
The case is still pending.
   Zaccaro said two other colleges refused to admit him because of
the drug charge and he couldn't get a job.
   ``My mom, who had helped so many college kids get jobs, was
devastated by her inability to help me. `They don't want the
notoriety of John Zaccaro working for them,' she told me.'''
   So he volunteered at Covenant House, riding around in a van all
night to offer food, emotional support and other help to teen-age
runaways, many of them involved in drugs and prostitution.
   ``I'm just John, a friendly face in a blue van. Many of these
kids pick up newspapers out of the trash cans. If they read the
stories about me and my family, they don't make the connection. And
I'm glad of that,'' he wrote.
   ``I'm proud of my family _ my mom for taking on a tough fight
and my dad, well, for going through a lot of grief in a gentle way
that gives me a lot to imitate.''

<HEAD>Upgrades on Navy's Attack Submarines Leads to $1.3 Billion Overrun</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Navy effort to upgrade future Los
Angeles-class attack submarines has generated delays at production
shipyards and contract overruns totaling $1.3 billion, the service
said Tuesday.
   The estimated $1.3 billion overrun covers 23 of the attack subs
scheduled for delivery into the 1990s and amounts to roughly a 5.9
percent increase over the negotiated target price for each
submarine, the Navy said.
   The Navy's target price for each of the attack submarines
currently is between $750 million and $760 million. Of the 23
submarines covered by the latest overrun estimate, 11 are being
built by General Dynamics Corp. and 12 by Newport News Shipbuilding
& Drydock Co.
   Under the production contracts covering the vessels, the overrun
will be split 50-50 with each of two shipyards building the subs,
meaning the Navy will have to pay out roughly $650 million beyond
the target price of the 23 submarines.
   The Navy said it already had the funds on hand to pay the
overrun, however, because it had anticipated there might be some
delays associated with improving the Los Angeles-class of subs.
   ``The Navy has retained funds to cover all improvements, and
there are no plans to seek additional funds from Congress to cover
these improvements,'' the service added.
   The delivery delays vary by shipyard, but range from seven
months to 18 months, the Navy said.
   The Los Angeles class, also known as the 688 class, is the
Navy's primary attack sub. The nuclear-powered vessel is designed
to hunt and destroy Soviet submarines and is built at General
Dynamics' Electric Boat Division in Groton, Conn., and at the
Newport News shipyard in Newport News, Va.
   The Navy is now in the midst of research and development work on
a new attack submarine, designated the SSN-21 Seawolf, but doesn't
anticipate that vessel materializing before 1994 at the earliest.
   In the interim, the Navy set out to improve the 688-class
submarine with such things as a stronger hull to allow Arctic
operations; better electronic and sensor systems; a series of
noise-reduction modifications; and installation of launching boxes
for Tomahawk cruise missiles.
   The service said Tuesday some of the improvements had required
extensive modification of the original design, leading to delays
that were not totally unexpected.
   In this case, the Navy and contractors have at least agreed up
front on how cost overruns will be handled and thus should avoid
the type of legal wrangling that erupted after cost overruns
skyrocketed on the same submarine in the 1970s, said Assistant Navy
Secretary Everett Pyatt.
   ``I'm not going through that again,'' Pyatt added.
   Four Newport News boats are now expected to be delivered from 14
months to 18 months late, while seven General Dynamics' submarines
will be delivered from seven months to nine months late.
   ``We want the deliveries on as timely a basis as possible, but
we have to acknowledge the fact that the modifications which we
asked for were a contributing factor,'' Dan Howard, the Pentagon's
chief spokesman, said Tuesday.

   Republican George Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis, favored in
the busiest primary day ever, cast their ballots today in Super
Tuesday elections designed to give a Southern cast to the
presidential race. With strong support throughout Dixie, Democrat
Jesse Jackson made a last-minute appeal to minority voters.
   It was the biggest day in the history of presidential primaries,
one that could virtually settle the Republican race and give a
clearer focus to the crowded Democratic contest.
   Five candidates were among the voters.
   ``If we exceed our expectations of live up to them, I think
we'll be in good shape,'' said Bush as he arrived at his polling
place in Houston.
   GOP rival Bob Dole told reporters in Missouri that ``it's going
to be a little tougher as we go along, but I've been in tough
fights before.''
   Dukakis voted in the Brookline section of Boston and denounced
as ``garbage'' television ads run this weekend by Sen. Albert Gore
Jr. of Tennessee. The ads said he let Massachusetts lose
manufacturing jobs at a rate eight times the national average and
that his foreign policy views had been described as ``mushy.''
   Jackson made one last pitch to black voters in Alabama and
Hispanic voters in Texas in his bid to translate Dixie appeal into
delegates.
   Republican Pat Robertson was carrying David and Goliath dolls
when he arrived to vote in Virginia Beach, Va., and said they
symbolized his contest against Bush.
   ``I am the conservative candidate and I will be the conservative
candidate all the way to New Orleans,'' he said, referring to the
site of the Republican National Convention.
   Gore and his wife, Tipper, voted in Carthage, Tenn., and the
candidate said, ``I think we've got the momentum. I think we're
going to have a good day.''
   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri voted by absentee ballot.
   Voters began to make their choices in 14 Southern and border
states and in seven other locales as far afield as Hawaii and
American Samoa. Early reports on voter turnout ranged from light to
moderate in many Southern states to projections of a record turnout
in Texas. ``It's just a steady stream,'' said Vernon Tigner, the
Democratic judge at Cross Creek 22 in North Carolina.
   It was raining in Arkansas and elections officials reported a
light turnout except in black areas where it was heavy.
   ``We are having a pretty heavy turnout,'' said Janice
McClelland, a worker at a predominantly black precinct in
Crittenden County.
   Bush sounded confident of a solid delegate boost toward the
Republican nomination. Dole had already returned to the Midwest,
flying to Illinois which holds its primary next Tuesday.
   ``The person that clearly wins Super Tuesday is going to be the
nominee of the party and I think the next president,'' Bush told
reporters in Tulsa on Monday.
   Dole also was in Oklahoma and while conceding Bush was likely to
carry most Super Tuesday states, said, ``We don't want to lose the
White House by nominating the wrong person.''
   An ABC News poll of voters in Super Tuesday states said Bush was
leading in 16 of the 17 states holding Republican contests. Dole
was ahead only in Missouri.
   ABC News said it interviewed a total of 8,659 voters across the
region between March 3 and 6 for the survey, but cautioned that its
samples in the non-Southern states were too small to produce
specific numbers for the candidates. It said the margin of error
for the Southern results was 3 percentage points either way.
   The survey indicated that not only that Bush was leading
throughout the South, but that his strongest leads were in the two
biggest states _ Texas with 111 delegates and Florida with 82.
   Among the Democrats, Dukakis had a lock on his home state of
Massachusetts and Rhode Island and was leading in Florida, Maryland
and by a narrow margin in Texas.
   Jackson was the leader in Deep South states such as Alabama,
Georgia, Mississippi and Louisiana, as well as Arkansas, North
Carolina and Virginia where blacks comprise up to 30 percent of the
Democratic electorate.
   ``Hands that once picked cotton tomorrow morning will pick a
president,'' Jackson told an exuberant crowd at a rally in
Birmingham, Ala. on Monday night.
   Gore, banking on his Southern heritage and longest time spent
capaigning the region, was leading in Kentucky, Oklahoma and
Tennessee, according to the survey.
   Gephardt, counting on winning support with a populist appeal,
was said to be leading only in his home state.
   A new poll published today in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution
also gave Bush a wide lead in the South, finding him favored by 56
percent of Republicans surveyed in 12 states in the region. On the
Democratic side, Jackson led with 29 percent support, followed by
Dukakis and Gore with 20 percent each.
   For Robertson, the Southern primaries amounted to his last, best
chance to demonstrate that he could mount a serious challenge to
the establishment candidates. Despite a strong following among
evangelical Christians, the former television preacher has yet to
win a GOP primary and was a disappointing third in South Carolina
on Saturday, a state he once boasted he would win ecisively.
   ``Bush has me four to one,'' Robertson said Monday in Charlotte,
N.C. ``I'm like David up against Goliath. But we will do very well
in the South.''
   Rep. Jack Kemp of New York was given no chance of carrying a
Super Tuesday state and planned to meet with advisers on Wednesday
and was presumed to be ready to drop out of the race.
   On the Democratic side, Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois made no
effort in the Super Tuesday states and planned to resume his
candidacy in his home state.
   Gary Hart trudged on, attracting little notice and even less
support.
   Holding Republican and Democratic primaries were Alabama,
Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma,
Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. In addition, Democrats
in American Samoa, Hawaii, Idaho and Nevada were holding caucuses
as were both parties in Washington.
   Democrats in Minnesota, constrained by national party rules from
allocating delegates from their caucuses held two weeks ago, were
doing so tonight.
   Dukakis was the big winner in Minnesota, but Jackson and Simon
also were expected to pick up delegates.
   The states holding Republican primaries were selecting 712
delegates, more than two-thirds of the 1,139 needed for a
convention majority.
   On the Democratic side, the prize was 1,307 delegates. A total
of 2,082 were needed for the nomination.
   The latest Associated Press delegate count gave Bush 126, Dole
65, Kemp 35 and Robertson 8. For the Democrats the count was
Dukakis 69, Gephardt 50, Gore 21, Jackson 27, Simon 35, Hart 0, and
uncommitted 258.
   During a campaign flight in Missouri, Bush told reporters he
wouldn't predict a sweep. ``It's too much for anyone to expect,''
he said.

<HEAD>State Challenges Navy Order That Workers Can't Take Part In
Caucuses</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with judge denying restraining order; new throughout</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TACOMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge today refused to issue a
restraining order that would have allowed civilian workers at a
Navy shipyard to participate in Washington's presidential precinct
caucuses tonight.
   The Navy earlier had said that the federal Hatch Act prevented
11,600 workers at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton from
speaking out on which candidates they preferred.
   U.S. District Judge Jack Tanner's brief order said the state of
Washington, which had asked for the restraining order, failed to
show irreparable injury would result if the Navy's position were
allowed to stand and ``failed to establish the balance of hardships
tip in their favor.''
   Tanner's ruling came in a hastily filed state suit, which
contended that prohibiting federal workers from speaking at the
party caucuses unconstitutionally violated their right to free
speech.
   The suit, filed Monday, asked Tanner to clarify the intent of
the Hatch Act by interpreting ``conflicting sections'' of the
regulations, said David Bryant, a spokesman for the Washington
secretary of state's office.
   Secretary of State Ralph Munro was miffed at the ruling and said
the state may pursue the case for future years.
   ``I'm disappointed he didn't provide federal workers more
protection,'' he said. ``I can't believe in the long run that this
is constitutional.''
   He said the state's abortive attempt at gaining an injunction
did succeed in clarifying that federal workers may attend their
caucuses and participate in most respects.
   ``It sends a clear signal they can go to the caucuses and do
everything but speak out on the canidates,'' Munro said. ``It's
absurd. A guy can say `What America needs is a senator from Kansas
who was wounded and was a war hero,' but he can't say, `What
America needs is Bob Dole.'''
   A bill to revise the Hatch Act and allow workers to participate
in partisan political activities on their own time overwhelmingly
passed the U.S. House last year. It is pending in the Senate.
   Officials at the Bremerton shipyard had told workers they could
attend the political caucuses scheduled in 12,000 Washington
neighborhoods, but could not discuss candidates.
   The caucuses are the first step in the months-long process
leading up to a selection of delegates from Washington to the
national presidential nominating conventions this summer. At stake
ultimately are 73 Democratic national convention delegates and 41
Republican delegates.
   The Hatch Act states that federal employees may not use their
official authority or influence to interfere with an election.
   ``Obviously, addressing the caucus is part of the activity,''
said James Sommerhauser, representing Professional and Technical
Engineers Local 12 in Bremerton, but ``most federal employees are
so intimidated by the Hatch Act they're afraid to participate.''
   Sommerhauser said his union represents 1,800 federal workers at
the yard and elsewhere in the county.

   Water, food and bugs were not to
blame for a mysterious outbreak that sent 91 students to hospitals,
officials said Tuesday.
   Ninety of the 91 students from Rincon Junior High School were
back in school Tuesday, a day after they were treated for rashes,
swollen eyes, blisters, stomach cramps or breathing difficulties
following physical education classes, said Diane Ho, a spokeswoman
for the Rowland Unified School District.
   Soil samples were to be taken Tuesday, and physicians were to
interview the students, Ms. Ho said. ``Hopefully we will find out
something and solve this mystery.''
   School district officials believe the students came in contact
with the contaminant on the playground Monday morning. But experts
called in by the district have ruled out water, herbicides, bugs,
grass and school-prepared food, Ms. Ho said.
   No adults experienced any symptoms, Ms. Ho said. One student,
who has asthma, remained overnight in a hospital, she said. But
some students were given medication.

authorities in the West African island nation of Sao Tome e

   A correspondent reporting from the former Portuguese colony for
Lisbon's Radio Commercial said 40 armed men landed by canoe before

others.
   The radio correspondent, Jaime Marques de Almeida, said the
government blamed the coup attempt on the National Resistence Front
of Sao Tome e Principe that has its headquarters in Libreville,
Gabon. He said the government was expected to make an official
statement on the reported coup attempt later.
   The Lisbon-based secretary-general of the National Resistence
Front, Quintiliano Loures Amado, denied the group was responsible.

   Fundamentalist Moslem students attacked a
group of scouts with knives, stones and bicycle chains, then opened
fire on security forces as they came to the scouts' aid,
authorities said Tuesday.
   Two policemen and two extremists were wounded slightly, said a
police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said officers arrested about 50 students after the Monday
night incident and another 20 on Tuesday. Many had been arrested
after a demonstration late last year.
   The fundamentalists apparently attacked the male and female
scouts because of their belief that the sexes should not mix.
   Police said the fundamentalist students were found with two
empty pistols, iron rods, knives and daggers. About 25 shell
casings from rounds used against security forces were found at the
stadium on the Assiut University campus where the violence occurred.
   On Tuesday, police clamped tight security on the downtown
courthouse where the suspects were housed. On campus, about 500
fundamentalists tried to demonstrate for the release of their
classmates but were stopped by university guards, security
officials said.
   Street demonstrations are banned in Egypt under an emergency law
enacted after Moslem extremists assassinated President Anwar Sadat
in October 1981.
   For several years, the university campus has been a hotbed of
Moslem fundamentalist agitation in Assiut, a southern Nile town 235
miles south of Cairo.
   Monday night's trouble began during a meeting and parade of the
Rovers, the equivalent of the Explorers in the American Boy Scout
program.
   University officials said militants attacked the parade.
   University guards were unable to contain the fight and called
for help from outside security police, normally banned from the
campus.
   Four people were hurt in the melee that followed, but the Rovers
escaped unhurt by climbing out stadium windows and clambering down
fire escapes, security officials said.
   In a telephone call to The Associated Press in Cairo, a man
claiming to speak for Assiut's fundamentalists blamed security
police for the trouble. He said his group demonstrated because the
university administration had ``organized a dancing and singing
party,'' and security police broke up the demonstration with tear
gas and batons.
   Security officials said the suspects were charged with firearms
and other weapons offenses and destroying musical instruments.
   The fundamentalists appear to have been angered because they
believe the sexes should be forbidden from mixing in parties,
picnics or other social events.

   Sen. Albert Gore Jr.'s Southern strategy faced a do-or-die test
on Super Tuesday. Democratic rivals Michael Dukakis and Jesse
Jackson were favored overall in the battle for 1,307 party
delegates and Richard Gephardt fought for survival.
   Jackson, a black man born and educated in the South, relied on
his wide support among that region's large black population and
figured to be among the delegate leaders in the Super Tuesday
voting.
   Gov. Dukakis of Massachusetts was virtually conceded the support
of his home state, and he sought to win on both sides of Dixie with
strong bids in Texas and Florida.
   Gore of Tennessee and Gephardt of Missouri were heavily favored
to win their home states. They battled among themselves for what
was left of the white vote. Theirs was a struggle for survival,
with each reduced to a strategy aimed at emerging as the white
alternative to Dukakis when the campaign moves elsewhere.
   Two other candidates were on the ballot but weren't factors:
Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois and Gary Hart, the former senator from
Colorado.
   Twenty states and American Samoa were holding Democratic
contests in what was the closest thing to a national primary ever
held.
   Most were in the South, where every state save South Carolina
had a primary. South Carolina Democrats select delegates Saturday.
   Outside the South, there were primaries in Massachusetts, Rhode
Island, Washington state, Idaho and Nevada.
   At stake were 1,307 delegates _ more than half the number needed
to win the nomination. A candidate had to receive at least 15
percent of the vote in a congressional district or statewide to win
delegates.
   Jackson is from the only Southern state not voting, South
Carolina. But he had a strong appeal to blacks, who make up a
quarter of the Democratic vote in the South _ and as much as half
in Alabama and Mississippi.
   With so many white candidates fragmenting the vote, Jackson
hoped to score well in other Southern states, too.
   After wins in New Hampshire, Maine and Vermont, Dukakis hoped to
demonstrate an appeal to Democrats outside New England, and he
concentrated heavily on Texas and Florida. He had wide appeal among
Jewish voters in south Florida and Hispanics in Texas.
   Gore followed a Southern strategy that ignored the earliest
contests, even while insisting he was a national candidate. But he
faced a severe battle even to emerge as his own region's candidate.
   Gephardt entered the Southern campaign with little money to
mount the heavy television campaign that succeeded for him in the
earlier states. He and Gore sought the moderate and conservative
vote.
   Simon, running as the clear liberal, was reeling and broke from
third-place finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire. He sat out the
Super Tuesday campaign and awaited the next stop, his home state of
Illinois where he planned a low-budget campaign to get back in the
race.
   Hart, a year ago the odds-on favorite, acknowledged before Super
Tuesday that he didn't expect to be the nominee but was pressing
his candidacy in an effort to steer the campaign debate.
   Hart had re-entered the race in December but couldn't regain the
support he had before dropping out seven months earlier amid
disclosures about his relationship with model Donna Rice.

   Seven women have been attacked in the last
month by the ``Center City Stalker,'' who forces them into secluded
areas of downtown buildings, robs them, ties them up and sometimes
rapes them, police said.
   The Stalker strikes day or night, with the latest attack at 8
a.m. Monday in the lobby of a downtown building, say police, who
speculate he may be a security guard because he showed a badge to
one victim.
   Police Commissioner Kevin Tucker has formed a special 24-hour
task force.
   ``My dad will pick me up from work every day this week until
they catch that animal,'' said Diane Mills, a Federal Express
employee said.
   Police have distributed composite drawings to office buildings
and businesses, and Federal Express couriers dropped off copies of
a police sketch as they made deliveries Tuesday.
   Monday night, police swarmed the streets after the latest victim
gave a description that matched ones from victims in four of the
other six cases.
   The 20-year-old woman was on her way to a class near City Hall
when she was grabbed near an elevator, police said. The man dragged
her at gunpoint into a secluded spot, robbed her of two gold chains
and a diamond-studded gold watch.
   One man has been arrested and charged with robbery and attempted
rape in another case. But none of the seven Stalker victims could
identify him in a lineup, police said.

   The Reagan administration on Tuesday joined a
group of senators in urging the South African government to release
Zwalakhe Sisulu, a prominent black journalist detained for the past
14 months without trial.
   ``We see no justification for Mr. Sisulu's detention,'' State
Department spokesman Charles Redman said. ``He has been a leader in
efforts to resolve South Africa's political problems peacefully.''
   ``He's the type of black leader the South African government
should be talking to, not repressing,'' Redman added.
   Redman said U.S. Ambassador Edward J. Perkins made a personal
appeal to the South African authorities for Sisulu's release and
``we will continue to urge'' his freedom.
   A group of 52 senators has written South African President P.W.
Botha on Sisulu's behalf. The letter was made public Monday.

<HEAD>55 American Tourists Hurt in Bus Crash</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A bus carrying American tourists on a trip
through the Holy Land skidded on a rain-slick highway east of the
occupied Gaza Strip and flipped over Tuesday, injuring all 56
people on board, officials said.
   Three of the 55 Americans were in serious condition and the bus
driver also was hurt. The passengers, en route from Israel to
Egypt, crawled from the overturned bus through shattered windows.
   ``I was climbing over bodies. Blood was just running all over,''
said Dora Bowling, a retired secretary from Fairmont, W.Va.
   The Americans were participating in an extensive tour of the
Holy Land sponsored by the United Methodist Church's West Virginia
Conference.
   Tour coordinator Wendall Eskew identified the three seriously
injured passengers as Margaret Glass of Dunbar, W.Va.; Mary Lou
Moore, of Charleston, W.Va.; and Donna Light of Wheeling, W.Va.
   He said Glass and Moore are in their 70s and Light is in her 50s.
   Five other people were in moderate condition at Barzilai
Hospital in Ashkelon, 15 suffered minor injuries and the others
were treated and released, said Ilana Zeev, a spokeswoman for the
facility, 40 miles southeast of Jerusalem.
   ``We were going around a curve and it was raining and slick and
the bus seemed to hydroplane,'' said Bonny Eskew, a piano and organ
teacher from Charleston, W.Va.
   ``We were heading for a ditch, then we swerved back to the
right, lost control and turned over,'' said Mrs. Eskew, 59, who had
a badly bruised right eye. ``It happened so fast we didn't have
time to do anything.''
   Passengers spoke at Jerusalem's Hyatt Hotel, where they returned
after being treated at the Ashkelon hospital.
   Many of the Americans suffered fractured limbs, including broken
hands, wrists and shoulder bones, or cuts requiring stitches, said
an emergency room surgeon who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Police commander Ezra Menashe told Israel army radio the
accident involved a bus from the East Jerusalem Tourism Co. and
occurred on the road between Miflasim and Kfar Azza, two collective
farms located about three miles east of the Gaza Strip.
   The tourists were headed from Jerusalem to Cairo via the
Egyptian border crossing at Rafah on the southern tip of the Gaza
Strip. The bus departed from the northern city of Tiberias.
   Debbie McGraw, a church secretary in Charleston, said the bus
was carrying lay people and clergy from various parts of the state,
as well as relatives from Virginia and possibly other states,
McGraw said.
   She said the bus passengers were part of a larger tour and had
opted to extend the tour and visit Egypt. She said tour members on
the bus were scheduled to return Friday and Saturday.
   Those on the bus had ``successfully completed a Holy Land
pilgrimage and were on the way to Egypt for a three-day tour
extension,'' said Richard Ridgeway, vice president of Educational
Opportunities Inc. of Lakeland, Fla., the tour operator.

   China's foreign minister told President Reagan
today his government is very concerned about the Iran-Iraq war and
supports an arms embargo against the Tehran regime, a White House
spokesman said.
   President spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the administration
also accepts China's declaration that it no longer is selling
Silkworm missiles to Iran, although it remains a supplier of
conventional arms.
   Reagan met for nearly 40 minutes in the Oval Office with Wu
Xueqian, who was making his first visit to the United States in
four years. Posing for photographers, Reagan said, ``We have a very
cordial relationship between our two countries and we want to
continue it.''
   Briefing reporters on the meeting, Fitzwater said Wu offered
support for a U.N. cease-fire resolution in the Iran-Iraq war, and
also endorsed an arms embargo to back it up ``if the overwhelming
majority of the (U.N.) Security Council believed it should be
adopted.''
   Fitzwater said the administration did not believe that Wu was
trying to qualify or limit his endorsement.
   ``It was our reaction, the president's reaction, that this was a
very positive sign, a very strong expression of support and one,
frankly, one we hope the Soviet Union would emulate,'' Fitzwater
said.
   In the talks, Reagan did not bring up the subject of the
Silkworm missiles, although it was discussed in Wu's earlier
meetings with Secretary of State George P. Shultz, Fitzwater said.
   The United States protested to China last fall about its sale of
Silkworms to Iran. ``To the best of our information, they have not
delivered any missiles since then,'' Fitzwater said.
   While noting that China still remains a major supplier of
conventional arms, he said, ``We think the fact that we have not
detected any new missile shipments and their general attitude
toward the Iran-Iraq war and the U.N. resolution _ that those are
very hopeful signs.''
   Wu met Monday with Shultz and with Defense Secretary Frank C.
Carlucci.
   During toasts following a State Department luncheon on Monday,
Shultz and Wu hailed the progress in bilateal relations and made
almost no reference to issues dividing them.
   Chief among those issues is China's reported sales of military
weaponry to Iran in defiance of U.S. efforts at the United Nations
to win support for a worldwide arms embargo against Iran.
   The administration has been seeking assurances from China that
it will not veto an embargo resolution.
   Last October, the United States retaliated against China for
selling Silkworm anti-ship missiles to Iran by suspending the
process under which China had been given increasing access to U.S.
products with advanced technology.
   Since then, China has said it has stopped selling Silkworms to
Iran.
   Shultz made no reference in his remarks to recent anti-Chinese
rioting in Tibet. State Department spokesman Charles Redman said
between three and nine people are believed to have been killed, and
he expressed deep concern over the human rights situation in Tibet.

   A 9-year-old boy on Monday accidentally
fired a .38-caliber handgun into a seat on a school bus carrying
about 45 children, bruising a child's knee, authorities said.
   The 9-year-old boy was suspended pending investigation, and the
7-year-old boy who was bruised did not require medical attention,
authorities said.
   ``We believe that the child didn't know what he was doing _ it
was just a prank,'' said Sandra Lindsay, assistant superintendent
for instruction.
   The bus was about a mile from Knightsville Elementary School,
which both children attended, when the gun discharged as the boy
was trying to unload it, Mrs. Lindsay said. She said he got the gun
from his parents' home.
   The bullet went through the bus seat, ricocheted and bounced off
the knee of a boy two seats behind. Mrs. Lindsay said the bullet
didn't pierce the boy's pants, but caused a small bruise.
   The children on the bus were being counseled by school nurses,
guidance counselors and principals, and none appeared extremely
upset, said Bob Flowers, transportation director.

``Milstead, 49 ...''

<TEXT>
   Arizona's ranking lawman said today he
decided to cooperate in an investigation of an alleged death threat
but didn't tell Evan Mecham because the governor was so angry about
the probe he ``was not to be reasoned with.''
   Department of Public Safety director Ralph Milstead, in his
second day of testimony at Mecham's impeachment trial, continued to
insist that Mecham had obstructed justice by ordering Milstead not
to cooperate.
   During his five hours of testimony Monday, Milstead had
portrayed Mecham as a frightened, angry leader who told him: ``I
don't want you to help the attorney general hang me. Don't tell him
anything.''
   The first-term Republican governor is accused of trying to
thwart an investigation into whether an associate, Lee Watkins,
threatened last Nov. 12 to send former top Mecham aide Donna
Carlson on ``a long boat ride'' if she testified before a grand
jury investigating Mecham's campaign finances. Watkins has denied
threatening Ms. Carlson.
   During continued cross-examination today by defense attorney
Fred Craft, Milstead testified that Mecham was fully informed about
the alleged threat and the involvement of the attorney general's
office when he told Mecham the attorney general wanted information
from DPS officers about the matter.
   Milstead said today he did not tell Mecham during their
telephone conversation that he intended to cooperate with the
attorney general despite the governor's order not to.
   ``I was in shock from his anger that was directed toward the
attorney general,'' Milstead said. ``He was not to be reasoned
with.''
   Milstead testified Monday that he considered the alleged threat
serious because Watkins had a criminal record. Watkins resigned as
state prison construction chief after a past assault conviction was
disclosed.
   Milstead, 49, said he phoned Mecham on Nov. 15 to alert him to
the possible death threat. ``I think my words to the governor were,
`I don't want you to be blindsided,'' said Milstead.
   Milstead said when Mecham told him not to cooperate with the
attorney general, ``I was in shock over what he was saying, taken
aback, speechless.''
   Craft asked Milstead why he had not included his own part of the
conversation in a report he wrote on his talk with Mecham.
   ``Because I'm not committing a crime,'' said Milstead. ``I'm not
obstructing justice.''
   ``When did you conclude that the governor's words constituted a
crime?'' asked Craft.
   ``As I'm hearing them and reflecting on them,'' said Milstead,
adding it took him ``about two seconds'' after hanging up the phone.
   Craft asked if Milstead was surprised that his staff didn't tell
him the governor had assigned cabinet member Max Hawkins, then-head
of the department of administration, to investigate the death
threat allegation.
   ``No, it didn't surprise me,'' said Milstead. ``Max Hawkins is
not a law enforcement officer. He's not competent to investigate
it. Lee Watkins works for him, and Max Hawkins wouldn't be taken
seriously anywhere on Earth that I know of.''
   The senators decided Monday to forego hearing from Watkins
because it meant granting him immunity from prosecution. Watkins
invoked Fifth Amendment protection against self incrimination.
   Senators also expressed impatience with Craft's long
interrogation, which Minority Leader Alan Stephens, a Democrat,
called wearing and repetitious.
   ``If that's what they do in a court of law,'' said Stephens,
``I'm glad I'm not a lawyer.''
   Mecham, 63, the first U.S. governor to be impeached in six
decades, is not attending his trial and did not comment on
Milstead's testimony. In January, he testified before a House
impeachment committee that he may have told Milstead not to
cooperate with the attorney general's investigation but that he was
not fully informed about the seriousness of the situation.
   Mecham also is charged with concealing a $350,000 campaign loan
and misusing $80,000 in a state funds by loaning it to his car
dealership.
   He faces a a May 17 recall election and a March 22 criminal
trial on the campaign loan disclosure allegation. A prosecutor in
that case, however, sought Monday to have it delayed until April 21
on the ground that pretrial defense maneuvers have left the
prosecution too little time to prepare.
   Defense lawyers Monday filed a series of motions, including one
asking for a dismissal of the charges.
   Judge Michael Ryan of Maricopa County Superior Court said he
would rule Wednesday or Thursday on the prosecution request but did
not indicate when he would rule on the defense motions.

<HEAD>Robertson Supporters Hope for Triumph; Dukakis Favored Among
Democrats</HEAD>
<HEAD>Ed: Caucuses begin at 11 p.m. EST.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pat Robertson's fervent band of supporters waged
political warfare against Republican regulars in presidential
caucuses Tuesday, while Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis was
favored over his Democratic rivals.
   None of the state's 41 GOP delegates were directly at stake in
the caucus voting, but the former television evangelist hoped to
embarrass Vice President George Bush and Kansas Sen. Bob Dole.
   Robertson was given a good shot at winning the state where
evangelicals have controlled the party for most of a decade,
ramming through anti-abortion, ultraconservative platforms at
carefully orchestrated conventions.
   ``We're stomping the daylights out of them!'' Robertson's state
organizer, Bruce Hawkins, said with a delighted chuckle a few days
ago.
   Bush and Dole forces, waging conventional campaigns, admitted to
high anxiety over the Robertson Factor, but held out hope the party
regulars would get worried enough to go to their neighborhood
caucuses.
   The caucus voting was basically a straw poll, since delegates
elected to go on to district-level caucuses are not bound to any
candidate.
   On the Democratic side, with 65 delegates at stake, Dukakis
benefited from endorsements by Gov. Booth Gardner, Sen. Brock
Adams, Seattle Mayor Charles Royer and other party leaders.
   Jesse Jackson and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon were fighting it out
for second- and third-place finishes and a sizable number of
caucus-goers were expected to vote for uncommitted delegates, said
state Democratic Chairwoman Karen Marchioro.

<TEXT>
   A 48-year-old man who held his 11-month-old
daughter at gunpoint for more than five hours was arrested today
when police officers crept into his apartment and found him asleep,
police said.
   Warren Dean Brown was arrested without incident after the
five-hour standoff, during which police evacuated other residents
of Brown's apartment building, some of them going down ladders from
second-floor windows, said Helena Police Chief Bill Ware.
   Brown is charged with felony assault and was scheduled for
arraignment later today in Helena Justice Court, Ware said.
   Brown was arrested about 1 a.m. when police entered the family's
apartment. They found Brown asleep in the master bedroom with his
young daughter, Crystal, and a loaded .22-caliber pistol, Ware said.
   The incident began at Monday night when police received a call
from another resident of the building.
   Ware said Brown's wife, 26-year-old Kathy Brown, had escaped
with another daughter, 3-year-old Amber, after Brown pistol-whipped
his wife with the handgun, striking her on the face.
   ``The area was secured and the wife ... indicated Mr. Brown
stated he was going to kill the family,'' Ware said.
   Mrs. Brown was taken by ambulance to St. Peter's Community
Hospital, where she was treated and released.
   Police evacuated seven people from two other apartments in the
building.
   Of the 35 officers in the Helena Police Department, 20 were at
the apartment complex while Lewis and Clark County sheriff's
deputies assisted with other calls in the city.
   There was no phone in the Brown apartment and Brown did not
respond to a hostage negotiator who spoke through a bullhorn, Ware
said.
   Police aimed a directional microphone at the apartment, heard no
movement inside, and at 1 a.m. sent in three members of the
department's ``quick response team,'' who found Brown and the child
in a bedroom, along with the loaded pistol, the chief said.
   No shots were fired during the incident and Brown offered no
resistance when arrested, Ware said.
   He said Crystal was returned to her mother, who along with her
two daughters is now staying with friends.

   Scott B. Chambers, editor of the New
Castle Courier-Times for 50 years, has died. He was 80.
   Chambers, who died Monday in the Henry County Memorial Hospital,
was part owner of the Courier-Times until the Chambers family sold
it to Nixon Newspapers Inc. in 1986.
   ``Scott was a major force for both freedom of the press and in
the development and welfare of New Castle,'' said Wes Rowe,
publisher of the Courier-Times.
   Chambers was graduated from Indiana University in 1930 and
became managing editor of the paper when the Chambers family
purchased the Courier and consolidated it with the Times, which the
family already owned.
   When Chambers' father, Walter S. Chambers Sr., became ill in the
late 1940s, Scott Chambers became both editor and publisher of the
Courier-Times.

   George Bush bid to take command of the Republican presidential
race in Southern-dominated Super Tuesday elections that offered a
third of all nominating delegates. Michael Dukakis hoped to show
nationwide appeal and emerge as the front-runner in a bruising
Democratic race.
   Jesse Jackson, drawing upon his black political base in Dixie,
looked to win several states and hundreds of Democratic delegates.
Sen. Albert Gore Jr. tested his Southern strategy in a battle with
Rep. Richard Gephardt to emerge as the moderate contender in the
industrial states to come.
   Pre-election surveys indicated Bush could hope for a sweep of
the GOP contests, with Sen. Bob Dole contesting in just a handful
of states. Pat Robertson and Jack Kemp seemed out of the running
almost everywhere.
   The campaign was notable for its accusatory TV commercials. The
number of convention delegates at stake _ 712 in 17 Republican
contests and 1,307 in 21 Democratic primaries and caucuses _ made
Super Tuesday the busiest day of this or any other presidential
nomination campaign.
   As the day dawned, Bush and Dukakis were the leaders in the hunt
for national convention delegates. Democratic delegates from
Minnesota's Feb 23 caucuses were being allocated with most to
Dukakis, followed by Jackson.
   Beforehand, Dukakis had 70 delegates, Gephardt 50, Simon 36,
Jackson 28 and Gore 22. It takes 2,082 delegates to win the
Democratic nomination.
   Among the Republicans, it was Bush with 126, Dole with 65, Kemp
with 35 and Robertson with 8. It takes 1,139 delegates to win the
GOP nomination.
   Democratic surveys suggested that Dukakis and Jackson would each
carry at least a handful of states. Dukakis had his home state of
Massachusetts in his pocket, but Gore countered with his Tennessee
and Gephardt with Missouri.
   Dukakis, having won several New England contests, hoped to
demonstrate a broader appeal than any of his rivals with victories
in Texas, Florida, Washington, Maryland, Rhode Island and Hawaii.
Jackson was strong all across Dixie and Gore's hopes seemed to rest
on the strength of second-place finishes.
   Dukakis targeted his campaign at ethnic voters, liberals and
union workers in pockets across the South, aiming his appeal as
well at the huge elderly population in Florida.
   Dukakis hoped to use his superior finances and organization to
pick up dozens of delegates in states where he didn't expect to win
outright. His rivals made the same effort on a smaller scale,
knowing they could earn at least one delegate in any congressional
district where they received 15 percent of the vote.
   Jackson, who has run well in some states without a large number
of black voters, was drawing on his core constituency for the first
time this year and hoped to win in Georgia, Virginia, Mississippi,
Louisiana and Alabama, as well as one or two other states.
   Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois bypassed the Super Tuesday elections
to concentrate on the primary next week in his home state. Gary
Hart, the long-ago front-runner, was the invisible man politically.
   The Republican picture was entirely different. Bush, whose
campaign was in jeopardy before New Hampshire voted three weeks
ago, was comfortably ahead in pre-election polls in nearly every
Super Tuesday state. He aimed to pile up enough delegates to make
his nomination seem inevitable, while Dole hoped to snare enough to
carry him credibly to next week's primary fight in Illinois.
   Robertson, the former television evangelist, bid for second
place in a few states and a win in the Washington caucuses. Kemp,
who had dreamed of emerging as a conservative alternative in the
race, faced a 17-state shutout and seemed likely to withdraw later
in the week.
   Gore was banking everything on a strong showing in his native
region. He began with his base in Tennessee and hoped to pick up a
few hundred delegates even if he finished behind Jackson across
Dixie.
   Gephardt, who won the kick-off Iowa caucuses exactly one month
ago and followed it up in South Dakota, counted on a home state win
in Missouri.

<HEAD>Radical Sikh Leader Appointed To High Religious Post</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A radical Sikh priest freed from jail
just three days ago was elected Tuesday as chief priest for the
Golden Temple, a post that makes him spokesman and spiritual leader
for 25 million Sikhs.
   The council responsible for Sikh shrines unanimously picked
Jasbir Singh Rode to be the new head of the Akal Takht, or eternal
throne, the seat of Sikh authority, United News of India reported.
   The sprawling Golden Temple complex in Amritsar is Sikhism's
holiest shrine. The council, the Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak
Committee, met in Chandigarh, the capital of Punjab state about 150
miles north of New Delhi.
   Rode, 34, replaces Darshan Singh, a moderate who resigned last
year.
   Rode was released from jail Saturday. He has been in custody
since 1985 on federal charges of sedition but was never brought to
trial.
   His release, and that of other Sikh priests and militants, is
believed linked to a government move to include militants in the
political process in Punjab, which has been wracked by a Sikh
separatist insurrection since 1982.
   On Sunday, the government dissolved the Punjab state
legislature. The legislature had been suspended since May 1987
after an escalation of separatist violence. Since then, Punjab has
been ruled by the federal government.
   New elections will have to be held in the state, possibly

Sikh extremists. Most of the victims have been Hindus or moderate

   Both races were marked by accusatory campaign commercials on a
scope that was unprecedented for a presidential campaign.
   Dukakis aired a commercial featuring an acrobat doing
somersaults as he tried to depict Gephardt as a man who flip-flops
on the issues. Dole ran commercials saying Bush had approved
arms-for-hostages swaps during the Iran-Contra affair.
   Thus ended what amounted to a Southern regional primary
campaign, an idea hatched by Democratic officials who wanted to
give a moderate-to-conservative contender a boost toward the
party's 1988 nomination.
   The idea was to help nominate a Democrat who could run strongly
across the South in the general election campaign in the fall _ and
bolster the prospects of Democratic candidates in local elections.
   But whatever the theory, the result was a struggle carried out
largely through costly television commercials with no particular
Southern cast. The candidates, trying to campaign in an impossible
number of areas simultaneously, often were reduced to staging
appearances at airports so they could leave as quickly as possible
for the next stop.
   But the commercials were eye-catching, particularly on the
Democratic side. Voters who didn't see the ads would read about
them in the paper or see clips on the television news.
   Gephardt attacked Dukakis for raising taxes while governor of
Massachusetts and mocked Dukakis for once suggesting that farmers
diversify their crops by growing Belgian endive. He also aired a
spot seeking to portray Dukakis' campaign as guilty of a string of
dirty tricks.
   Dukakis returned fire with ads featuring an acrobat doing
somersaults, while the announcer attacked Gephardt as flipflopping
on critical issues.
   Gore retooled his message in mid-campaign with a populist appeal
designed to siphon off some of Gephardt's support. His final flurry
of ads attacked Gephardt and Dukakis. In one commercial he even
added a mild jab at Jackson.
   As much as anything, Super Tuesday was a test of Gore's Southern
strategy for gaining the nomination. Alone among the contenders, he
ignored the Iowa caucuses and spent months collecting endorsements
and campaigning in his native region in hopes of jump-starting his
campaign at home after others had left the field. However, among
the original Democratic candidates, only Bruce Babbitt was gone by
Super Tuesday.
   The Democratic idea for a regional primary suited the Bush
forces fine. The vice president's aides quickly spread the word
that they had erected a ``Southern fire wall'' that would contain
any damage resulting from defeats in earlier contests. And when
Bush finished a poor third in the Feb 8 Iowa caucuses, it looked
like the theory would get a test.
   But then came Bush's victory in New Hampshire's primary,
followed by his convincing triumph in the South Carolina primary on
Saturday.
   And instead of merely hoping to hold his own, the vice president
spent the last two days campaigning and advertising heavily in
Dole's strongest state in Missouri in hopes of pulling off a sweep.
   Dole suffered through a difficult period as his campaign manager
fired two senior aides in an internal struggle for control.
   Even as the polls opened on Super Tuesday, the contenders were
looking ahead to the next round in the nominating wars.
   Dole had begun airing television commercials in Illinois, a
contest his aides said he had to win to sustain his candidacy.

   The average college administrator got a 3.3
percent pay increase this year, down from 5.3 percent a year ago,
the College and University Personnel Association said Tuesday.
   The 3.3 percent increase for 1987-88 was less than the 3.7
percent increase in consumer prices during the same period, and the
first time since 1982-83 that the college salaries trailed the rise
in the Consumer Price Index.
   The association derived the figures from its 11th annual survey
of how much colleges pay their presidents, deans and other
administrators.
   College tuitions have been rising faster than consumer prices
for most of the 1980s, and campuses have come under increasing
pressure from Secretary of Education William J. Bennett and other
critics to hold down costs.

   A senior Tibetan Communist Party official Tuesday
condemned the ``savage actions'' of his Tibetan countrymen who
sparked two days of anti-Chinese riots in the capital of Lhasa last
week.
   ``Sabotage'' of the monk-led rioters ``went completely against
the people's wish for a normal democratic life.'' Tibet's party
Deputy Secretary Raidi was quoted as saying by the official Xinhua
News Agency.
   Xinhua also claimed in a report from Lhasa that no policemen
carried arms while on duty Saturday. Western sources have said that
five Tibetans and three policemen were killed in the rioting, while
Chinese officials say the only death was that of a policeman.
   Another Chinese official report said the riots, which started
Saturday, stretched into Sunday. Previous reports said there was no
unrest Sunday.
   That report, by the China News Agency, also said Tibetan monks
tried to poison the tea of Chinese officials and journalists
attending ceremonies to mark the end of a major Buddhist festival.
   Xinhua said 309 policemen were injured, 29 seriously, by
Tibetans attacking with stones, clubs and iron bars. The China News
Service, monitored in Hong Kong, put the number of hospitalized
police officers at more than 30.
   There have been unconfirmed reports that some rioters were shot,
and Western travelers in Lhasa, contacted by telephone, have
reported seeing large contingents of armed police.
   Travelers said police on Tuesday withdrew their blockade from
around the Jokhang Temple, Lhasa's main temple and the scene of the
violent protest against Chinese rule.
   William Tang, assistant foreign manager at the Lhasa Hotel, said
guests were told they could go to the temple's market square but
``at their own risk.''
   ``Most Tibetans detest and oppose the savage actions of the
handful of splittists,'' Raidi, a Tibetan, told Xinhua.
   Splittists is a termed coined by the Chinese to describe those
who seek independence for regions in China.
   The weekend violence followed a similar outbreak of
pro-independence unrest in early October during which at least 14
people died.
   Chinese troops entered Tibet in 1950 after beating Nationalist
Chinese forces in a civil war. Nine years later, Tibet's spiritual
and temporal leader, the Dalai Lama, fled into exile after an
abortive uprising.
   Many Tibetans continue to be bitter about China's suppression of
local customs and religion and its destruction of temples.
   China News Service accused the monks of being the ringleaders
Saturday, the final day of a major 10-day festival known as the
Great Prayer Festival.
   The report said monks Saturday attacked the vans of Chinese TV
crews photographing the 500-year-old prayer festival and dropped a
22-pound boulder from a rooftop.
   Seven cars from Tibet's local TV station and a camera were
smashed, the report said. Two cars were turned over and another set
afire as the rampaging monks shouted, ``Smash anything that is
communist!''
   A Western traveler said Tibetans told him police beat two monks
to death inside the Jokhang Temple.
   Several Tibetans later carried the monks' bodies around the
square, he said, triggering further clashes.
   The Dalai Lama, in a statement from his office in New Delhi,
Monday said the violence clearly revealed the ``desperation'' of
the Tibetan people. He called on Tibetans to ``restrain from
violence in spite of repressive measures that the Chinese may
take.''

<HEAD>Progress Reported On Fine Print</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Negotiators on Tuesday reported progress in their
work on the fine print of an emerging Afghan settlement in talks to
end nine years of fighting.
   U.N. mediator Diego Cordovez told reporters that negotiations
were focusing on ``sensitive technicalities'' of the four documents
that are to make up the peace package and govern the withdrawal of
an estimated 115,000 Soviet troops backing Kabul's communist
government.
   Asked if there was substantive progress, he said ``yes'' but did
not elaborate. ``Even if the two sides wanted to sign the accords
now they cannot do so before the agreements are ready,'' he said.
   Cordovez's optimistic comments came as an Afghan resistance
group quit the seven member anti-Soviet alliance because it said
the interim government in Afghanistan could be dominated by Moslem
extremists.
   The abrupt departure of the Afghan National Liberation Front
reduces to two the number of moderate parties in the alliance.
   ``Pakistan is going to bring in a fundamentalist government. It
is not good for Afghanistan. It will destroy Afghanistan,'' said
the front's leader, Sibghatullah Mojaddedi.
   It was not clear how Mojaddedi's move might affect negotiations.
   Cordovez and other sources close to the talks made it clear that
nothing spectacular was likely to emerge in the next few days from
the indirect negotiations between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
   ``You should go sightseeing for three days,'' he counseled
journalists.
   Still, there was considerable behind-the-scenes activity.
   Cordovez and delegates reportedly kept close touch with deputy
U.S. Secretary of State Robert Peck and another visitor, Ambassador
Nicolai Kozyrev, described as a Soviet specialist on Afghan affairs.
   Pakistan's chief representative, acting Foreign Minister Zain
Noorani, was eager to dispel any notions of a standstill.
   ``Things are moving forward,'' he said. ``Don't you see that I
am coming here every day?''
   A diplomatic source who insisted on anonymity said prospects for
a settlement continued to look good in the current round, which
started March 2. The source said that no substantive discussions
had taken place on the question of an interim government. Pakistan
wants the formation of a broad-based transitional Kabul government
to move on a ``second track'' parallel to the implementation of
troop withdrawal.
   It argues that only a generally acceptable government can ensure
the safe return of more than five million refugees and prevent more
bloodshed in the country already mourning more than one million
dead.
   The Kabul delegation has publicly rejected Pakistan's request as
an attempt to introduce an extraneous issue that could undermine
the talks. But Pakistan is reported to be still hoping for a
compromise, perhaps by agreeing to sign the settlement with the
present leadership _ which it does not recognize _ in return for
assurances that an interim government will be formed soon afterward.
   Pakistani president Muhammad Zia ul-Haq, in Dubai for
inauguration of the Emirates Golf Club, said Tuesday an interim
government was a necessary ingredient in any settlement.
   ``We do not want to go over just pages of an agreement. Out of
the Geneva process we want to take a comprehensive settlement. And
for that settlement, an interim government is one of the most
essential instruments,'' Zia said.

   An Afghan resistance group on Tuesday
quit an anti-Soviet alliance because of fears that the interim
government in Afghanistan will be dominated by Moslem extremists.
   Sibghatullah Mojaddedi, leader of the moderate Afghan National
Liberation Front, also resigned as party chief.
   The front's abrupt departure reduces to two the number of
moderate parties in the alliance.
   Hamed Karzai, the party's information director, said Mojaddedi's
move was to protest plans for a future Afghan government worked out
by the alliance's Moslem extremist members.
   ``For us it's is finished,'' Karzai said of the alliance.
   At a news conference, Mojaddedi said the ``most important
decision about Afghanistan'' had been made by seven people _ the
leaders of the seven-party alliance.
   ``Nobody has looked to the 15 million people of Afghanistan,''
he said, adding that the three million Shiite moslems had
particularly been ignored.
   Mojaddedi said the proposal for an interim government announced
late last month was too hardline.
   ``Pakistan is going to bring in a fundamentalist government. It
is not good for Afghanistan. It will destroy Afghanistan,''
Mojaddedi said.
   He said the best alternative was to convene a grand national
council, whose membership of about 1,000 would include commanders,
scholars, tribal and religious leaders, refugees and Afghans living
abroad.
   The council, he said, would decide the future government.
   Moslem extremists in the alliance apparently oppose that plan.
   The alliance, under pressure from Pakistan, announced in late
February plans to form a future Afghan government headed by an
all-guerrilla executive council and 28 ministers, possibly
including non-communist officials from the communist government in
Kabul.
   While Pakistan cautiously endorsed the plan, rumors soon
circulated in Peshawar that the alliance leaders were split over
which parties should wield the most power.
   Pakistan, which is negotating with the Kabul government over a
withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan, has insisted that the
formation of a broad-based interim Afghan government is crucial for
the safe return of about 5 million Afghan refugees from Pakistan
and Iran.
   Meanwhile, the remaining six guerrilla leaders called an
emergency meeting to discuss the development. None of them would
comment on Mojaddedi's move.
   Although Mojaddedi personally has considerable political
influence, his party, comprised of traditional Pathan tribal
militias with few outside sources of military or financial support,
is not strong.
   The split comes at a sensitive time for Pakistan, which speaks
for the guerrillas at U.N.-sponsored peace talks in Geneva.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Paul Simon, silent in the South, lies in
wait for Democratic rivals Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis as the
presidential campaign turns north to Illinois where Sen. Bob Dole
is readying a Republican last stand against George Bush.
   Jackson hopes to reap delegates and votes in Chicago, where he
lives, while Simon seeks strength from state Democratic leaders who
encouraged him to keep afloat his fading campaign effort.
   The home-state candidates face a strong challenge from Dukakis,
whose well-heeled and well-organized staff has scoured the state
since last fall and has slates in all districts. Dukakis will
likely hammer away at economic themes in a state struggling with
plant closings and job losses.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt is not expected to mount a major campaign
in the state. He sees no hope of success, given Simon and Jackson's
built-in strengths and Dukakis' substantial effort.
   ``I think with muddled results (from Super Tuesday) and a strong
favorite son in Paul Simon, we're going to look at the state beyond
that, and that's Michigan,'' said spokesman Mark Johnson.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of near-neighbor Tennessee plans to spend
part of the week in Illinois, as does former Sen. Gary Hart of
Colorado,
   On the Republican side, Sen. Dole, a Kansan who has done well in
the Midwest and calls Illinois ``friendly territory,'' has another
shot at farm votes.
   However, Vice President Bush is backed by Gov. James Thompson,
93 of 102 county leaders and other influential state leaders.
   ``There are no areas we consider ourselves weak in,'' said Ed
Murnane, deputy campaign director.
   Dole also has a strong state operation, with coordinators in all
counties and well-known delegate candidates, said campaign director
Mark Schroeder. Dole's organization began shifting forces to
Illinois even before Super Tuesday.
   Rep. Jack Kemp of New York and former television evangelist Pat
Robertson were not expected to be major factors.
   Illinois is a diverse state, with numerous ethnic groups,
industrial centers, farms, big cities, small towns, professionals
and blue-collar workers.
   ``Illinois is a microcosm of the nation,'' said Samuel Gove, a
political scientist and director emeritus at the University of
Illinois' Institute of Government. ``A candidate who can do well
here can do well nationally.''
   More than 5.9 million residents are registered to vote in
Tuesday's primary _ the lowest number for any statewide election
since 1982. The race is divided into a non-binding presidential
preference, dubbed the ``beauty contest,'' and the selection of
delegates pledged to a candidate or uncommitted.
   Because of heavy emphasis on earlier races, the candidates have
devoted little time to Illinois, where 113 Democratic and 82 GOP
delegates will be chosen Tuesday. The remaining 85 will be selected
at party meetings.
   During the next six days, however, candidates will crisscross
Illinois and burn up the airwaves with their messages. Dukakis
aides, for example, have said they expect to spend about $500,000
on TV advertising.
   Simon, however, a first-term senator who has served as
congressman, state lawmaker and lieutenant governor, doesn't plan
any TV advertising here.
   ``He shouldn't have to. He's run here his whole life,'' said
Jerry Sinclair, Simon's Illinois political director. ``We're short
of dollars.''
   Both Simon and Jackson have made strong showings in recent state
polls.
   Simon, who is supported by many party leaders, has denied
speculation he stayed in the race so Illinois delegates committed
to him can attend the national convention.
   ``The plan is to concentrate on Illinois and then the Midwest
industrial states, to keep accumulating delegates,'' Sinclair said.
``The way it looks now, no one is going to get this thing on the
first ballot. If it becomes more and more ... fragmented, why
should Paul drop out?''
   But Jack Van Der Slik, political studies professor at Sangamon
State University in Springfield, said, ``His votes are going to be
lower than before he bowed out of Super Tuesday. He's going to look
weak. That's going to be the coup de grace.''
   Jackson, though, expects to do better than his 1984 showing of
21 percent of Illinois' vote, said spokesman Frank Watkins.
   Watkins said Jackson has delegate slates in 21 of 22
congressional districts, compared with four in 1984. He said
Jackson will fare well in Chicago, where 56 percent of the voters
are black or Hispanic, and will expand his white base, as he has in
Vermont and Minnesota.
   Van Der Slik, however, said, ``I think Jesse is much more
vulnerable in this state. People have made up their minds about
him. He was much more of a fresh face in a lot of those other
situations.''

   City supervisors have agreed to ban the
sale of realistic toy guns following the recent fatal shooting of a
retarded boy who drew a toy pistol on police officers.
   The measure was proposed by Supervisor Wendy Nelder, daughter of
a former police chief, who said some toy stores already have
removed toy weapons from their shelves.
   ``Nobody wants to be responsible for a little kid's death, or a
police officer's death, or anybody else's,'' she said in an
interview.
   On Feb. 17, two police officers killed Silivelio ``Tony''
Grohse, 13, when he pointed a toy gun, which the officers thought
was real, at them during a confrontation.
   The district attorney's office cleared the officers of
wrongdoing, saying they had a ``well-founded fear for their lives.''
   In another incident on Dec. 21, 1986, a police officer shot a
15-year-old burglary suspect to death after the youth held up a toy
gun.
   Toy guns already are banned in Los Angeles and neighboring
Burbank and Santa Monica.
   Nelder's plan won unanimous tentative approval late Monday
night. Final adoption usually is a rubber-stamping procedure taking
place within 30 days.
   Under the plan, possession of a toy gun would still be legal.
Otherwise, she notes, it would be possible for a police officer to
arrest people in one house for having toy guns, but impossible to
arrest a neighbor with real weapons that were otherwise legal.
   It also will be legal to sell toy guns that were obviously toys.
But, Nelder said, ``They'd have to be about four feet long and made
of pink plastic, because that's about all nowadays that makes
something a toy gun.''
   Many toymakers already are changing designs as the result of
pressure from retailers like Toys R Us, which has urged
manufacturers to come up with ways to keep toy guns from being
mistaken for authentic guns, said Douglas Thomsom, president of the
New York-based trade group Toys Manufacturers of America.

   Two British weeklies have accused Prince Andrew's
wife, the former Sarah Ferguson, of brash and vulgar behavior
during the couple's recent visit to California.
   London's Sunday Times said that after seeing the Duke and
Duchess of York, Americans will likely ``retreat to their more
refined dinner parties, there to cap each other with anecdotes
about the awful vulgarities of the British.''
   The Observer, a liberal weekly, in a profile of the 28-year-old
duchess, said: ``Something appears to have gone awry with the royal
fairy story.''
   The newspapers were particularly critical of the duchess' quip,
``I'll see you later,'' to a man who yelled out, ``I love you,''
breaking a fake bottle over her husband's head and what they saw as
generally failed attempts at humor.
   The Sunday Times, in an article by sketch writer Craig Brown,
criticized British daily newspapers for using headlines such as
``Hollywood Bows to a Touch of British Class'' and ``Royal
One-Liners Woo U.S. Hosts.''
   Of a black-tie dinner at which the duchess wore a red-and-black
gown, Brown wrote:
   ``While the stars of Hollywood dressed in discreet black and

   The Observer asked, ``Has the Duchess of York gone too far?''

noblesse to be too obliging.''

   A Continental Airlines airliner that
crashed and left 28 people dead waited 24 minutes in a snowstorm
between de-icing and takeoff while other aircraft were taking off
only 15 minutes after de-icing, officials said today.
   Robert Benzon, heading a National Transportation Safety Board
investigation team, said possible ice buildup on Continental Flight
1713 would be among the ``items of interest'' to be considered as
four days of hearings into the November crash began.
   The DC-9, powered by two Pratt & Whitney JT8D-7 engines, had
just lifted off when it rolled over and broke into three pieces as
it slid down a snow-covered runway. Twenty-eight people were killed
and 54 others were injured.
   Other possible crash causes being considered included the
inexperience of the pilots and a wingtip vortex from a plane
landing on an adjacent runway, Benzon said in an opening statement.
   Flight attendant Kelly Englehart testified today that she had
been so worried about the weather and the co-pilot's inexperience
that she asked the pilot who would be landing the plane in the
snowstorm when the flight returned to Denver.
   ``It as snowing outside, and the weather was pretty bad. It was
the second officer's second trip, and I just wanted to know,'' said
Englehart, adding that Capt. Frank Zvonek told her he would land
the plane.
   Benzon noted that said that Zvonek, 43, who had 198 hours on a
DC-9 with only the previous 33 hours as captain, and First Officver
Lee Bruecher, 26, never had flown together before. Both were killed.
   Benzon said the NTSB investigation showed the temperature was 28
degrees Fahrenheit and the wind was blowing at 10 knots, gusting to
17 knots, when the plane was being prepared for takeoff.
   ``The tower personnel (the control tower) could not see the
de-icing pad or the end of the runway because of low visibility,''
he said.
   He said 24 minutes elapsed between the time the plane was
de-iced and the time the plane took off.
   ``Other aircraft on the ramp during this time frame were
spending approximately 15 minutes between de-icing and takeoff,''
he said.
   ``The reasons for Flight 1713's 24-minute delay and the possible
effects of snow or ice buildup on the wings and tail surfaces of
the airplane during this delay are items of interest during this
hearing,'' Benzon said.
   Englehart, the first of 29 scheduled witnesses, then testified
that she closed her eyes and prepared to die as the plane slid down
a snow-covered runway at Denver's airport last Nov. 15.
   She the DC-9 had just lifted off the runway at Stapleton
International Airport when it rocked first to the left and then
sharply to the right, finally turning over and coming to a stop.
   ``A six-week-old baby in my section started screaming and
everybody was so glad to hear that baby cry. They knew the baby was
all right,'' she said.
   About 30 minutes of recorded cockpit conversation showed that
the crew used the appropriate checklist before taking off, said
Benzon.
   The wreckage also showed the landing gear was down and locked
and the flaps were at an appropriate takeoff setting upon impact,
he said.
   NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz said Monday that engine failure
will not be discussed because there has been no evidence that the
engines failed.
   The chairman of the board of inquiry is NTSB board member Joseph
T. Nall, assisted by three other NTSB staff members. ``A final
report is still many months down the road,'' said Lopatkiewicz.
   The Federal Aviation Administration, meanwhile, announced plans
Monday for ``white-glove inspections'' of Continental Airlines,
possibly as early as this summer.
   The Continental inspection is part of a continuing effort by the
FAA to take a regularly scheduled, full-scale look at the
operations of big domestic airlines, said FAA spokesman Fred Farrar.

<HEAD>WHO Official Calls Masters & Johnson Study `Irresponsible'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GLASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Health Organization's chief AIDS
investigator said Tuesday that sex experts William Masters and
Virginia Johnson were ``irresponsible'' for suggesting AIDS can be
transmitted by casual social contact.
   Dr. Jonathan Mann, the American director of WHO's Global Program
on AIDS, challenged the noted sex researchers to produce scientific
evidence or admit they were indulging in ``idle speculation.''
   ``If it's just theorizing, then I think they have done us all a
grave disservice,'' Mann told reporters at the First International
Conference on the Global Impact of AIDS.
   About 1,100 specialists from 20 countries attended the start of
the three-day meeting at London's Barbican Center.
   In a new book, Masters and Johnson claim U.S. health officials
have understated the extent of AIDS among heterosexuals to avoid
public panic. They also say that AIDS might be transmitted by
casual contact such as from a toilet seat or a waiter's bleeding
finger.
   They wrote in their book: ``The AIDS virus is now running
rampant in the heterosexual community.'' When that assertion came
under fire at a news conference in New York on Monday, Masters
said, ``I simply believe this.'' Johnson, asked the same question,
said ``I'm not sure we chose the word `rampant' ourselves.''
   Mann suggested the authors' assertion that AIDS might be more
prevalent among heterosexuals than health officials believe was a
matter for debate and might be useful if it strengthened awareness
that the disease can be transmitted both heterosexually and
homosexually.
   ``But if they're talking about putting their prestige behind the
idea that you can catch this from a toilet seat, I think that's
irresponsible unless there are data.''
   Mann said he strongly objected to the authors' implication
``without data, without information, that the virus spreads in
other ways than we know it spreads.''
   Mann and most other experts believe AIDS spreads mainly by
sexual contact, through the sharing of needles and from pregnant
mothers to their babies.
   The WHO official suggested that Masters and Johnson were trying
to promote their book with headline-grabbing findings, saying
``publicity about this will undoubtedly sell more books.''
   He also expressed doubt about the authors' scientific
qualifications regarding AIDS.
   ``They know a lot about sex. I don't know how much they know
about AIDS,'' said Mann, who added that he had not read the book
and was responding to news reports about its content.
   Asked again about the Masters and Johnson study at a later news
conference, Mann said: ``It would be very unfortunate if their
credibility in sex was used by people to give credence to their
theorizing rather than to the facts that have been collected about
AIDS in the last seven years from all over the world.
   During the AIDS conference, Dr. Gary Noble, deputy director of
the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta and head of the federal
agency's AIDS program, also refuted the Masters and Johnson study
without mentioning it by name.
   He said separate U.S. studies confirmed that AIDS is not spread
through casual social contact. One study showed that infected
people did not pass AIDS to members of their family except through
sexual contact. Another study showed that insects cannot transmit
the virus.
   Noble said that the incidence of AIDS among heterosexuals in the
United States had increased from 1.1 percent of all cases in 1982
to 2.3 percent in 1986. He said health officials expected that
proportion to increase to 4 to 5 percent by 1991.
   In his conference speech, Mann said AIDS sufferers face the
danger of discrimination and proposed an international system for
monitoring human rights violations in combating the disease.
   He did not explain how the system would work but said, ``we need
to know when and how discrimination occurs.''
   ``We know that in AIDS, isolation and exclusion create danger
and that inclusion creates safety,'' he said.
   Mann said the World Health Organization had recorded 81,433 AIDS
cases from a total of 133 countries as of March 1.
   As of Feb. 29, the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta had
received reports of 54,723 Americans with AIDS, 30,715 of whom had
died.
   The Geneva-based U.N. agency is co-sponsoring the conference
with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome cripples the body's natural
immune system, making its victims vulnerable to a variety of
infections and cancers. It is invariably fatal and there is no
known vaccine or cure.

<HEAD>Turner's New 24-Hour Cable Channel Could Start Oct. 3</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ted Turner's cable entertainment network could
start Oct. 3, now that Turner Broadcasting System's board approved
it.
   The board Monday unanimously approved the proposed Turner
Network Television, or TNT, which Turner said will compete directly
with the three major networks.
   ``With TNT, we are offering the cable industry the programming
vehicle to drive penetration past the 60 and 70 percent marks,''
Turner said in a statement.
   At present, about half the homes in the country with televisions
subscribe to cable television.
   Turner Broadcasting is prepared to invest up to $30 million in
TNT through the end of 1990. Plans call for the network to be
offered free to cable operators in 1988, but they will be charged
15 cents per subscriber in 1989, with the fee rising to 20 cents in
1990 and 25 cents in 1991.
   The new network is envisioned as an alternative to CBS, NBC and
ABC that will eventually offer first-run programming, major
sporting events and awards shows. Turner has said the company's
contract with the National Basketball Association could allow a
shift of games from Superstation TBS to TNT once the latter reaches
30 million homes.
   ``We will begin immediately to solicit subscriber commitments,
and preliminary indications from cable operators show strong and
substantial support,'' Turner said.
   Prime Cable in Atlanta has agreed to become the first cable
system to carry TNT, said Allan Barnes, vice president and general
manager of Prime Cable.
   ``TNT will provide us with the kind of breakthrough programming
we need to draw new subscribers,'' Barnes said.
   TNT would become Turner's fourth cable network, joining Cable
News Network, CNN Headline News and Superstation TBS.

   Police today found what appears to be
the painting by French impressionist Claude Monet that was stolen
from the Fisher Community Center nearly a year ago.
   ``We're extremely pleased,'' said Rex Ryden, head of the Fisher
Foundation. ``Obviously, it's going to be something that will be of
value as far as the entire art world is concerned.''
   Lt. Darrell Templeton said the department recovered the painting
in a mail drop box in LeGrand, about nine miles east of
Marshalltown.
   The painting, ``The Fishing Boats in Front of the Cliffs at
D'Etretat,'' is to be examined to see if it is the original. Ryden
said the painting was rolled up when found and that Templeton
unrolled it just far enough to determine that it may be the Monet.
   Ryden said officials will not bend nor otherwise tamper with the
painting for fear that it might be damaged in the process.
   The painting, valued at up to $300,000, was stolen March 19,
1987. Authorities soon after called in the FBI and the
international police agency Interpol to help locate it.
   The painting was stolen by a man who rushed into the center at
night, carved the 23-by-32 inch canvas from its frame and vanished
on foot.
   Ryden said the foundation's insurance carrier paid $175,000 for
its loss. ``I'm not sure who owns that painting now, since the
insurance company paid us for it,'' he said.

   The Reagan administration said today it
intends to keep holding the threat of sanctions over Panama's Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, but said no decisions have been made on
possible actions.
   ``The threat's still out there. We're still considering it. The
situation is changing rapidly and we're still monitoring it. But we
don't want to act precipitously,'' White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater told reporters.
   He made the comments to clarify statements he'd made earlier
indicating the administration might be withholding a decision on
possible economic and trade sanctions.
   Earlier in the day, the House Foreign Affairs Committee voted
unanimously to endorse Reagan's course of action against the
military regime and to urge him to consider further economic
sanctions.
   The administration has called for Noriega's removal since he was
indicted on federal drug trafficking charges in Florida last month.
   The sanctions are being considered as a means of bringing
pressure against Noriega's military regime and to promote a return
to civilian rule under President Eric Arturo Delvalle.
   ``Let me back you away from the inevitability of these kinds of
decisions,'' the spokesman had said initially, adding, ``It's been
our feeling from the very beginning that change should come from
within in Panama and we should watch it carefully and if that is
the process, that is preferable to our taking actions.''
   But Fitzwater later returned to the briefing room to say, ``We
want to keep the threat of sanctions still out there.''
   He said the options were still before the administration, but
that no decisions had yet been made. He said such decisions
depended upon ``a very complicated set of criteria.''
   He cited the impact the sanctions might have on the status of
the Noriega government, U.S. interests in terms of the canal, the
Panamanian military and U.S. investment in that country.
   Fitzwater also offered support for statements issued by Delvalle
and opposition parties that have called for the establishment of a
``government of national reconciliation.''
   ``We welcome those statements,'' the spokesman said. He also
issued a statement saying the U.S. government supports the goal of
``restoring democratic government and civilian constitutional
order. Once this goal has been achieved, we will work cooperatively
with the government of Panama toward the recovery of Panama's
financial and economic health.''
   The House Foreign Affairs Committee resolution, which will be
voted on by the House later this week, also reaffirmed
congressional support for the full implementation of the Panama
Canal treaties which require the United States to hand the canal
over to Panama at the end of the century.
   Rep. Stephen J. Solarz, D-N.Y., noted that Panama's military
ruler, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, has said that the criticism
from the United States aimed at his alleged involvement in drug
trafficking and other acts of corruption is actually a smoke screen.
   ``Noriega is contending the real reason is to create the
groundwork for an ultimate American decision to renege on the
commitment to turn over the Panama Canal'' in the year 2000, Solarz
said.
   ``This resolution shows that we fully intend to live up to our
commitments under the Panama Canal treaties,'' Solarz said.
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee already has adopted a
resolution calling for a total trade embargo against Panama, but
several members of the House panel said they thought that approach
was premature.
   Several members said their resolution is more in tune with
Reagan administration measured strategy and is essentially an
endorsement of a targeted approach designed to put pressure on
Noriega while not harming the Panamanian people as a whole.

<HEAD>Less Tax Cheating Because of Law Changes, Tougher Policing, IRS
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cheating on federal income taxes has declined
by as much as 20 percent, mainly because of tax law changes and
tougher federal policing, Internal Revenue Service Commissioner
Lawrence B. Gibbs said Tuesday.
   Gibbs told a House Appropriations subcommittee an IRS study
indicates the much-publicized ``tax gap'' _ the difference between
taxes owed and taxes paid _ has dropped to between $80 billion and
$90 billion in 1987. The agency's last report on the annual gap
estimated it would rise to more than $100 billion in 1987.
   Gibbs attributed the decline to campaigns by Congress and the
IRS to force stricter compliance, through tougher penalties and the
computer-matching of tax returns with income reports, and to the
numerous changes brought about by the 1986 tax law revision.
   The commissioner announced also that the IRS has temporarily
suspended efforts to collect back taxes from students who were paid
stipends for teaching or research work at their universities.
   ``We've put the word out (to IRS offices) to hold up on any'' of
the students' cases that are pending until the agency adopts a
consistent policy on how such income should be treated, Gibbs said.
   He said cases affecting students who receive stipends developed
from a computer matching of employer reports with students' tax
returns _ not from any IRS initiative to ``go after the graduate
students.''
   In dispute are stipends paid in 1984, 1985 and 1986. The 1986
tax revision declared all such stipends to be taxable income.
   IRS officials said they had no estimate how many students are
involved in the controversy, although The Washington Post on
Tuesday quoted unofficial estimates of up to 17,000 cases.
   ``Apparently there are some inconsistencies in the way the
examination of students' returns are being conducted,'' IRS
spokesman Steve Pyrek said. There is a wide variety of stipends
paid by colleges and universities, he noted, and some IRS field
offices are following court decisions on the issue while others
abide by a 1975 ruling by the agency itself.
   ``In looking at the cases, case law is a lot harsher (toward
students) than our rules,'' Gibbs told the subcommittee.
   The students' troubles began when their colleges sent the IRS
copies of W-2 wage statements indicating they were paid taxable
wages. When the students filed their tax returns, the computer
indicated those wages were not reported as income.
   Gibbs said the IRS hopes to announce within a month new
guidelines on treatment of such stipends from the three earlier tax
years.
   Also within a short time, the commissioner said, he hopes to be
able to report on the new estimate of the tax gap. He declined to
provide any details of the new findings but told the subcommittee:
``The amount of the tax gap has diminished since the last time we
did a study.''
   The last IRS study of the tax gap was published in 1983 and was
based on 1981 information. It estimated that individuals and
corporations dodged $81.5 billion in taxes on legal income that
year, by understating income and overstating deductions.
   The agency estimated that another $9 billion in taxes was lost
on three types of illegal income: drugs, prostitution and gambling.
The new report will not even attempt to estimate the tax loss from
illegal income that is never reporte.
   Since the last tax-gap study was published, IRS researchers have
reported evidence that taxpayers may be cheating less. In May 1986,
the agency released a report indicating that a 20-year trend of
declining compliance with the tax laws might have been reversed.
   That study estimated that voluntary compliance rose to 91.8
percent in 1982, from 91.0 percent in 1979. Compliance had declined
steadily from 94.3 percent in 1965.

<HEAD>Vatican Newspaper Criticizes Attempts To Discredit Rape Victim</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Vatican newspaper on Tuesday criticized attempts
by the families and friends of the accused to discredit a
30-year-old woman raped by three men.
   The woman walking to her car early Sunday was beaten and raped
repeatedly by three men near the Piazza Navona in central Rome. A
police patrol came on the scene of the attack and arrested the men.
   ``Digging into the private life of the victim, the three `good
boys' _ as they were defined by family and friends _ are trying to
appear to be the victims, wrapping the only true victim of the
incident in a halo of allusions, of accusations that are not even
well veiled,'' the Vatican newspaper Osservatore Romano said in an
editorial.
   It criticized the parents of the defendants, saying they
expressed ``wonder that a woman should walk around alone at that
hour, rather than being upset and expressing pain for the crime
committed by their sons.''
   ``Even if the assaulted woman was the last of the outcast, if
she was addicted to drugs or alcohol _ as some have suggested _ the
responsibility of the aggressors not only would not diminish, it
would increase.''
   The editorial came Tuesday as Italy celebrated Women's Day with
feminist speeches and calls for stronger measures to combat rape.
   Christian Democratic Senator Rosa Russo Jervolino, minister for
special affairs and the only woman in the Cabinet, also criticized
the defendants and their families.
   ``The behavior (of the three men and their families) shows a
distorted mentality which has completely lost sight of the value of
personal freedom,'' she said, ``We have a great job to do of
cultural restructuring.''

<HEAD>Comptroller Dismisses Proposed Penalties Against Former Bank
Chairman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The comptroller of the currency has dismissed
proposed civil penalties against a former Michigan bank chairman
accused of misusing bank funds.
   The ruling Monday by Comptroller Robert L. Clarke overturned an
administrative law judge's recommendation that Stanford Stoddard,
former chairman of Michigan National Corp., be fined $146,000 for
allegedly misusing $167,385 in bank resources for private purposes,
including wedding receptions, maintenance of home and vacation
properties and renovation of Mormon churches.
   ``Although Mr. Stoddard flagrantly misused bank funds, the
bank's expenditures ... do not constitute extensions of credit,''
Clarke said in his ruling. ``Accordingly, the civil money penalty
shall not be assessed.''
   Stoddard, 57, was removed as chairman of the bank holding
company in 1984 after the comptroller began investigating his
activities.
   The son of the bank's founder, Stoddard had run the company
since 1972.
   Stoddard's attorney, Richard Roberts, said, ``Our position ...
has always been that he did not (misuse funds), that the funds were
expended properly for him, either as ... charitable contributions
in the instance of the church properties, reimbursement or proper
expenditure on his behalf for entertainment, and other permissible
expenditures by a corporation on behalf of its chief executive
officer.''
   The comptroller's ruling said Stoddard used bank funds for four
purposes: renovation of buildings that were or were to become
Mormon churches; improvements to his residence, vacation home and
Florida condominium; payment of bills for a wedding reception for
his children and friends; and extensive personal secretarial and
errand services.
   The money was spent on salaries for bank employees assigned to
work on the projects, payment of bills for supplies, use of bank
supplies, and direct payments to contractors, the comptroller's
ruling said.
   Roberts said Stoddard had paid the bank about $280,000 as
reimbursement.
   In a separate statement, Clarke said his decision was not
intended to condone ``Mr. Stoddard's blatant misapplication of bank
funds.''
   ``Congress may wish to consider amending the appropriate
statutes to make it possible to asssess civil money penalties in
similar circumstances in the future,'' Clarke said.

<HEAD>Postal Rate Hike: Not Until April</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Higher stamp prices won't take effect until
next month, postal officials said Tuesday after postponing a final
decision on the effective date of the new rates.
   The board of governors of the U.S. Postal Service will hold a
special meeting March 22 to discuss putting the new rates into
effect.
   ``Although no definite decision on an effective date for rates
has been scheduled, the board has set April 3 as the target date to
give mailers advance notice to plan for the new rates,'' the agency
said in a statement issued following its meeting Tuesday.
   Under the law, the agency has to give 10 days notice once it
votes to impose new rates, so a vote on March 22 could get the new
prices in force by April 3, which is also Easter this year.
   The new prices, recommended by the independent Postal Rate
Commission last Friday following 10 months of deliberation, call
for a sweeping series of increases averaging more than 17 percent.
Included would be a 25-cent first-class rate.
   At Tuesday's meeting, new Postmaster General Anthony Frank said
he would like to restore some of the recently cut postal services
when higher stamp prices take effect, but he was concerned about
the costs involved.
   Post Office window openings and sorting hours were cut in
January in an effort to comply with congressional spending limits.
   The higher postage rates are not connected to those cuts, having
been proposed nearly a year ago to help compensate for the agency's
overall budgetary problems.
   But, Frank admitted, explaining to the public the reasons for
reduced services at the same time rates are rising ``is a very
difficult message to get out.''
   Frank said expanded window hours at some offices are being
considered, at least to help out during the changeover from one set
of rates to another.
   In addition, he said many offices will stay open until midnight
April 15 to accept last-minute tax forms.
   The Postal Service, meanwhile, announced that it is offering
telephone sales of stamps nationwide during the transition to the
new rates.
   Callers will be able to use Visa and MasterCard credit cards to
order the new undenominated ``E'' stamps, with the stamps to be
mailed out once the final decision is made on the new rate.
   Customers who want to order the non-denominated stamps can do
so, 24 hours a day, by calling 1-800-STAMP24. The minimum order
will be $12.50 plus a $2 service charge.
   Sales of stamps by telephone have been tested in eight cities
since last fall, with total sales now of more than $2 million.
   In addition to the new ``E'' stamps, which can be used only for
letters within the United States, some post offices still have
supplies of 25-cent stamps featuring a portrait of writer Jack
London.
   In addition, consumers with supplies of 22-cent stamps will be
able to purchase stamps to make up the difference between those and
the new rates.
   A new 3-cent stamp showing a Conestoga wagon was released Feb.
29, and some supplies of the 3-cent stamp showing Dr. Paul Dudley
White may also be available. Post offices also should have 2-cent
stamps featuring Mary Lyon and 1-cent stamps with the likeness of
Margaret Mitchell.

<HEAD>Madonna Play To Bypass Lincoln Center</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Speed-The-Plow,'' the new David Mamet play
starring Madonna and produced by the Lincoln Center Theater, will
bypass that cultural complex altogether and open directly on
Broadway, a spokesman said Tuesday.
   The play was to have been performed at the small, 299-seat Mitzi
Newhouse Theater in Lincoln Center before moving to Broadway's
Royale Theater in late April, said Merle Debuskey.
   Now it will begin preview performances April 9 at the Royale for
a May opening, possibly May 3, Debuskey said. He said ``Boys'
Life,'' the current tenant at the Newhouse, will extend its run
there until June 5. The play, written by Howard Korder, was to have
closed March 13.
   The Lincoln Center Theater, run by Gregory Mosher and Bernard
Gersten, has has experienced a booking jam at its two theaters.
``Anything Goes'' has been a solid hit at the larger Vivian
Beaumont Theater where it opened in October. Debuskey said the
vintage Cole Porter musical would remain until July 31 and then
transfer to Broadway.
   The Lincoln Center Theater opened its fall season at the Mitzi
Newhouse with ``Sarafina!'', a South African musical which has
moved to Broadway. Following ``Boys' Life'' at the Newhouse will be
``Road,'' by English playwright Jim Cartwright. It will open June
29.
   Debuskey also confirmed that ``Waiting for Godot,'' starring
Steve Martin, Robin Williams, F. Murray Abraham and Bill Irwin,
would be on the company's fall schedule. It will begin performances
Oct. 25 at the Newhouse, he said.

<HEAD>Soviets Present Two Drafts To U.S. Negotiators</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union, accused of foot-dragging by
Reagan administration officials, has presented drafts of two key
provisions of a treaty to sharply reduce U.S. and Soviet strategic
nuclear weapons.
   One of the documents submitted to American negotiators in Geneva
deals with ways to guard against cheating and the other with
procedures for eliminating the weapons.
   A U.S. official, speaking Tuesday only on condition of
anonymity, said there were ``big areas of disagreement'' with the
American positions in some respects and accord in others.
   He said the Soviet drafts, which were submitted Monday, were
being translated from Russian, and a full appraisal by the U.S.
side was not complete.
   The aim is to have the treaty ready for President Reagan and
Soviet General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev to sign at their next
superpower summit meeting. It will be held in Moscow in late May or
early June.
   The treaty would reduce the total arsenals of U.S. and Soviet
long-range bombers, missiles and nuclear submarines by 30 percent
to 50 percent.
   Charles E. Redman, the State Department spokesman, said ``it's
encouraging we have the drafts on the table.'' But, Redman said,
the ``real proof of the pudding'' will be whether the Soviet
proposals can be meshed with U.S. drafts.
   Still to come from Moscow is a memorandum of understanding
outlining the numbers and locations of Soviet strategic weapons.
The U.S. memorandum was offered last week.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze decided Feb. 22 in Moscow to give the
negotiators a month to agree on the three treaty protocols. The
idea is to have them ready for review by Shultz and Shevardnadze
when they meet in Washington on March 22-24.
   Last Friday, a U.S. official, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, said American negotiator S. Read Hanmer had complained
``very forcefully'' that Moscow had failed to submit its
verification and other proposals.
   At the same time, Phyllis Oakley, the State Department's deputy
spokeswoman, publicly criticized the Soviets for not presenting
their drafts. She said the complex issues required time for
thorough study.
   The negotiators face a number of obstacles in trying to get the
treaty ready. Ways to verify compliance with a cutback agreement is
only one problem.
   Another is the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative, which the
Soviets want to restrict. President Reagan has vowed not to give
ground, however, in the U.S. search for a space-based shield
against Soviet ballistic missiles.
   Another roadblock is the extreme difficulty in monitoring mobile
missiles and some of the other weapons that may be covered by the
treaty.

   Five Italian sisters showed their latest
furry creations at fall-winter shows Tuesday alongside the real
skins, and they dared the audience to guess which was which.
   Women who still yearn to wear the big cats can now choose the
Fendi sisters' version consisting of ocelot markings printed on
synthetic fur fabric coats with the added bonus of cuffs in real
sable.
   Karl Lagerfeld, who designs the Fendi collection, is never short
on witty ideas and when he wasn't making fabric look like fur, he
was reversing the process to make furs imitate fabrics. His long
winter coats in shaved weasel worked to look like corduroy velvet
were a case in point.
   There were plenty of other surprises, such as the big muffs in
chinchilla or sable which, at a flick of the models' wrists, became
complete fur coats.
   But although Lagerfeld had his fun with the fakes, he also
indulged in the real thing, showing styles in sumptuous mink,
sable, ermine and Mongolian lamb so lavish that that they could
retail for as much as $100,000.
   Favored shapes included high-waisted, oval-skirted coats that
harked back to the fashions in vogue in the early 1920s. Shoulders
were soft and natural with padding sent into retirement.
   There were spectacular capes such as the circular version in
black-dyed mole threaded intricately into lace, and shapely coats
in black ermine worked to look like shiny and matte-striped silk
velvet.
   A princess-line coat, fitted and flared, came in woven gray wool
and had an extra layer of warmth in its luxury lining of sumptuous
chinchilla.

   A House subcommittee Tuesday approved prime
national park sites in Washington for two new monuments honoring
Korean War veterans and the 5,000 black patriots who supported the
American Revolution.
   Interior Secretary Donald Hodel's designation of both proposed
monuments as being of ``pre-eminent historical and lasting
significance to the nation'' was endorsed by the House Interior
subcommittee on national parks and public lands by voice vote.
   Under a 1986 law, congressional approval of such a designation
authorizes construction of new monuments on choice parkland in
Washington that includes the Capitol grounds, the Mall, the
Ellipse, West Potomac Park and Constitution Gardens.
   The exact sites for the Korean War Veterans Memorial and the
Black Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial will be determined later.
Congress already had authorized construction of the two monuments,
and the Senate recently approved building both on preferred land.
   Rep. Nancy L. Johnson, R-Conn., said at a subcommittee hearing
Tuesday that there is only one monument in the capital that honors
a black American, a memorial to Mary McLeod Bethune in a remote
city park.
   Both monuments will be built with private funds and maintained
by the National Park Service.

   A Haitian sailing vessel with 60 people aboard was

Guard spokesman said.
   A ship holding 190 Haitians without legal entry papers was found
Saturday by the Coast Guard, and passengers were being sent back to
Port-au-Prince.
   Monday's interception was made by the cutter Vigorous near
Crooked Island in the Bahamas chain, said Coast Guard spokesman
Luis Diaz.
   The 45 men, 12 women and three children will be taken back to
Haiti by the Vigorous, he said.
   Coast Guard vessels were also searching Monday for another ship
reportedly in the area, said Diaz.
   Diaz said there had been a lull in Haitian interceptions in
recent months, and that the two seizures could signal renewed
efforts to enter the country illegally.

   A judge has denied a motion to reconsider
his reduction of a $10.5 million jury award to an 83-year-old woman
who was struck in the eye by a 7-Up bottle cap.
   Third District Court Judge Kenneth Rigtrup on Monday let stand
his Feb. 17 reduction to $375,000 the damages due Mae Roberts of
Holladay.
   Rigtrup said the jurors were ``inflamed with passion'' and had
awarded damages that were ``disproportionate and unreasonable.''
   Rigtrup awarded $75,000 in compensatory and $300,000 in punitive
damages. The jury had awarded $500,000 in compensatory damages and
$10 million in punitive damages.
   Colin King, the plaintiff's attorney, has said the judge's
action would nullify the jury's attempt to punish 7-Up and to send
a message to bottlers that negligence would not be tolerated.
   Roberts was struck in the eye when an aluminum twist-off cap
blew off a soda bottle she was opening with a pair of pliers. As a
result, the sight in her left eye was impaired.
   King said Roberts is unlikely to seek another trial because of
her age.

<HEAD>Proposal Would Increase Congressional Pay, Make Ethics Law Apply</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Justice Department official said Tuesday he
favors raising congressional pay to as much as $175,000 in exchange
for ending a ``double standard'' exempting senators and
representatives from federal ethics laws.
   Assistant Attorney General William Weld said it is ``neither
logical nor ... consonant with the notion of fair play'' to make it
a crime for executive branch officials to accept fees or honoraria
for job-related activities, while allowing members of Congress to
do so.
   In a National Press Club speech attacking public corruption,
Weld said he favors ``raising the salary of all members of Congress
to a level around somewhere between $150,000 and $175,000 a year.
This would enable you to do some other things like prohibit
honoraria.''
   ``It would very, very expensive, and ... worth every penny,''
said Weld, head of the department's criminal division.
   Currently, congressional salaries are $89,500 a year, which
senators may supplement with honoraria in an amount not to exceed
40 percent of their salaries. The percentage for House members is
30 percent.
   ``At worst'' the payment and acceptance of fees and honoraria
``can degenerate into a case of veiled extortion or a case of
veiled gratuity,'' Weld said.
   Weld also said Congress should apply to itself the federal
conflict-of-interest laws under which former White House political
director Lyn Nofziger was convicted of illegal lobbying. Congress
has exempted itself from those laws.
   Weld noted that while a member of Congress is free to lobby his
former colleagues the day after he leaves office, ``as recent
events have made abundantly clear, such behavior by a former member
of the executive branch would land one in jail.''
   Nofziger was found guilty of lobbying former White House
associates within one year after he left the government on matters
in which the agency had been substantially involved: a federal
contract for Wedtech Corp.; the continued production of A10
anti-tank aircraft; and civilian manning of Navy ships. Nofziger
faces sentencing later this month.
   Weld rejected the suggestion that he was raising the
congressional ethics issue in an election year to overshadow the
fact that a number of Reagan administration officials are under
criminal investigation or have been convicted of crimes.
   Weld's boss, Attorney General Edwin Meese III, is under criminal
investigation by an independent counsel.
   ``My remarks today are the same as remarks I've been giving
since ... 1978 ... so it's no recently cooked-up farrago,'' Weld
said. ``I'm speaking about legislation when I talk about double
standard, not anybody's performance. I'm not saying one branch has
a monopoly on sleaze.''
   Weld also expressed support for the 1978 Ethics in Government
Act under which independent counsels and the Office of Government
Ethics police federal ethics laws in the executive branch. The
investigation of Meese was launched last May 11 under that law.
   ``I like the Ethics in Government Act. I think it's a good
statute'' and ``I think it deserves to be enforced,'' Weld said.
   A former U.S. attorney in Boston, Weld said that when he came to
Washington in 1986, he mistakenly thought a dozen congressmen might
have broken the law when they accepted $2,000 fees in a visit to a
commercial enterprise over which their committee had jurisdiction.
   A deputy informed him ``that only members of the wicked and
nefarious executive branch and independent agencies are prohibited
from supplementing their salaries,'' he recalled. ``That very same
action ... would be a lay down criminal case if performed by
somebody in the executive branch.''
   The congressmen justified taking the fees by saying they
expected to be compensated for their time.
   Compensation is the word used in the criminal statute, which
``shows you how deep that double standard runs,'' said Weld.
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., agreed with Weld's suggestions,
saying his House subcommittee will address the congressional
exemptions with proposed legislation.
   Frank is chairman of the House judiciary subcommittee on
administrative law and governmental relations.
   Honoraria and fees ``give both the appearance and in some cases
the reality of improper influence,'' Frank said. Regarding
conflicts of interest, Frank said that when ``a one-time
colleague'' leaves Congress and ``next month is asking for a favor,
personal feeling gets into it that's not legitimate.''

<TEXT>
   About 4,000 supporters
of President Joaquin Balaguer marched through the capital Tuesday
on the eve of a 48-hour general strike called by the opposition.
   ``To the conspirators, we're going to give hell,'' shouted the
Balaguer supporters, who ended their afternoon rally at the
National Palace.
   A tense calm prevailed in the rest of the city of 1.5 million.
Police and soldiers were out in force, but the barricades, burning
tires and stone-throwing mobs of last week were absent.
   Wednesday's strike was called by the National Conference of
Popular Organizations, which claims to represent about 200 groups.
The issue is the soaring cost of living in this Caribbean nation of
6 million.
   Inflation last year rose 30 percent, according to private
economists, who predict that this year it will top 50 percent. The
Central Bank estimates inflation hit 16 percent in 1987.
   Coalition spokesman Fabio Ruiz said Balaguer's pledge to
implement price controls on bananas, onions, potatoes, rice and
beans, ``don't satisfy our demands.''
   The coalition also rejected Balaguer's pledge, made last month,
to increase the minimum wage by 33 percent to about $75 a month.
   Rising prices for gasoline, meat and other basic commodities
have touched off protests in several of the Dominican Republic's 26
provinces. In the past two weeks, six people have been killed and
about 20 injured by gunshots, tear gas or stones. Several hundred
people have been detained.
   Leftist groups and unions claimed Tuesday that police arrested
some of their leaders _ including Diaz Jaquez of the Dominican
Workers Party and Rafael Abreu of the General Workers Central _
without warrant, and interrogated others.
   Armed Forces Minister Lt. Gen. Antonio Imbert Barrera said
soldiers will patrol city streets and give ``full support'' to the
national police.
   The strike Wednesday is opposed by the main labor unions, the
Dominican Revolutionary Party, which is the main opposition party,
and the influential Roman Catholic Church. Those groups and others
have urged that compromises be negotiated to resolve the economic
problems.

   A U.S. official said Tuesday he would view as
``unfriendly'' any votes against a proposed United Nations inquiry
into alleged human rights violations in Cuba.
   Vernon Walters, the top U.S. representative to the United
Nations, made the statement at a luncheon for international
officials and business leaders as he stepped up pressure on allies
to back the U.S.-sponsored proposal.
   Walters also told the 43-member U.N. Human Rights Commission on
Tuesday that it should examine the alleged human rights violations
in Cuba or risk becoming ``accomplices of oppression.''
   He said a more harshly worded version of the proposal failed to
pass last year by one vote for political reasons. The United States
has complained of political bias at the commission, which often has
condemned human rights violations in Israeli-occupied territories,
South Africa and Chile.
   Walters said torture and secret executions continue in Cuba and
that ``freedom exists only to the extent that (Cuban leader) Fidel
Castro decides it can.''
   The resolution, which will come before the commission this week,
urges the Cuban government to permit the International Red Cross to
investigate prison conditions. It also asks the U.N.
secretary-general to investigate alleged human rights violations.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Tuesday that
Britain's current military exercise to reinforce the Falkland
Islands against possible attack by Argentina was ``no one else's
business.''
   Flatly rejecting protests by Argentina and other Latin American
countries, Mrs. Thatcher told the House of Commons that Britain had
a right and also ``a duty to see that reinforcement proposals could
in fact be carried out.''
   ``It is no one else's business except the defense of people's
rights in the Falkland Islands,'' said Mrs. Thatcher.
   About 900 troops will travel 8,000 miles next week to the
Falkland Islands from Brize Norton air base, north of London, as
part of the exercise, called Fire Focus.
   The exercise began this week with mythical ``intelligence
reports'' warning that Argentina was preparing again to invade the
south Atlantic archipelago which it has long claimed. The 1,800
British-descended islanders fiercely reject Argentine rule.
   Fire Focus is the first major maneuver announced by Britain
since it recaptured the islands from invading Argentine troops in a
74-day war in 1982.
   Britain has said it gave notice last month to Argentina of the
intended exercise and has since announced that Fire Focus will
involve fewer than 1,000 men.
   Britain maintains a garrison, reportedly of about 2,000 men, on
the islands and says it must practice sending in reinforcements in
order to avoid keeping more troops there permanently.
   Briefing reporters at Brize Norton on Tuesday, Foreign Office
Assistant Under Secretary Robin Fearn said Fire Focus ``threatens
no one. It is entirely defensive.''
   ``Far from being a cause for concern, it is an integral part of
our policy of reducing tension,'' he added.
   He said the initial post-war garrison had been halved in recent
years after the completion of a new runway at the Falklands
capital, Port Stanley, which can take wide-bodied jets.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $350,000 shortfall is casting a shadow on the
largest-ever Soviet-U.S. cultural exchange, a three-week festival
viewed by the State Department as an important symbol of improved
relations with Moscow, fund-raisers said Tuesday.
   With three days to go before its scheduled opening, ``Making
Music Together'' is heavily in the red because of unexpected costs,
said Harold Hestes, president of the Greater Boston Chamber of
Commerce.
   Hestes declined to detail what drove costs above the estimated
budget of $2.4 million, but said revised figures put the price tag
for the 80-event festival at about $3.3 million.
   Festival Operating Co. which is managing the American part of
the exchange, last month seriously considered the idea of declaring
bankruptcy and canceling the event, said lawyer Gabor Garai.
   Instead, company directors agreed to try and raise additional
funds ``in light of the national and international importance of
the event,'' said Garai, whose firm, Hale and Dorr, is providing
free legal counsel to organizers.
   Billed by U.S. organizers as the largest cultural exchange ever
with the Soviet Union, the festival, which runs though April 2,
will feature 285 Soviet musicians, dancers, composers and other
artists performing in the Boston area.
   It will continue in Moscow in the fall of 1989, where the
festival will concentrate on contemporary American music.
   Organizers originally had hoped to cover most costs through
ticket sales, a state contribution of $450,000 and private sector
pledges of $350,000.
   The state has promised to provide more grants and loans
amounting to $400,000, and businessess and charitable organizations
have pledged an additional $150,000, Hestes said.
   Of the outstanding $350,000, Hestes said, ``We're doing our best
to raise it (but) the cash flow situation is extremely tight.''
   ``It would be my hope that that the festival goes on no matter
what, as it would be tragedy for the state and the nations if it
would fail,'' he said.
   Hestes said he contacted the State Department about possible
cancellation recently, and ``the clear inference ... (was) that it
would be bad for our relations with the Soviet Union.''
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz expressed his personal
support and that of President Ronald Reagan last year, in a letter
to Sarah Caldwell, a key organizer of the exchange and artistic
director of the Opera Company of Boston.
   ``I want you to know that both the president and I personally
support these exchanges ....,'' he wrote to Ms. Caldwell. ``These
exchanges will continue to be an important element in the
U.S.-Soviet relationship.''
   Ms. Caldwell provided a copy of the Sept. 8 letter to The
Associated Press.
   In Washington, Greg Guroff, of the government-run U.S.
Information Agency, said he believes the Soviet Union ``has made a
tremendous commitment to this festival.''
   Guroff, head of the agency's office of U.S.-Soviet exchanges and
a former cultural attache to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, said the
Soviets would interpret cancellation as a rebuff.
   Because of guaranteed state funding of such events in the Soviet
Union, ``the American concept of fund-raising for most Soviets
...(is) not only incomprehensible, but it's not their problem,''
said Guroff. ``We have had two or three performing arts exchanges
that have fallen through from lack of funding: The fallout was
quite considerable in the Soviets' minds.''

   Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was
reported ``in good spirits'' and feeling well Tuesday after having
her appendix removed.
   O'Connor, 57, underwent the surgery Monday night at Bethesda
Naval Hospital.
   Court spokeswoman Toni House said O'Connor was feeling

   Justice Antonin Scalia, asked about O'Connor after he testified

   ``She sounded in good spirits,'' he said. ``I think she'll be

   O'Connor had been scheduled to testify with Scalia but she was
taken to the hospital in midafternoon Monday, and was operated on
about 8 p.m.
   Scalia explained O'Connor's absence to the subcommittee members
by saying, ``She had a supervening appointment with an
appendectomy.''

<HEAD>Strip Mining Chief Leaving Post March 20</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jed Christensen, director of the Office of
Surface Mining for the past three years, is leaving his job March
20, the Interior Department announced Tuesday.
   Christensen, who served as the government's chief regulator of
strip mining longer than anyone else, will become assistant chief
administrative officer of Fresno County, Calif.
   His boss will be Dan Fitzpatrick, with whom he worked previously
when Chistensen was a budget officer for Clark County, Nev. ``He
called me (just after taking office) and asked if I would be
interested ... I will be getting back to my roots.''
   He said he was ``not in the least'' pushed out.
   Christensen also has worked in local government in Provo, Utah;
Phoenix, Ariz and Santa Anna, Calif.
   He came to the Interior Department in 1981 and was appointed
acting director of the Office of Surface Mining in April 1985,
winning nomination as director in December 1985 and confirmation in
May 1986.
   Robert H. Gentile, an aide to Steven Griles, assistant secretary
for land and minerals management, has been appointed deputy to
Chistensen for operations, the department said.
   Christensen said it was ``up to the secretary'' to decide on a
successor, but other officials, speaking on condition they not be
identified, said they expected Gentile to be named acting director,
perhaps for the remainder of the Reagan administration.
   The office, formed by Congress in 1977 after a decade of bitter
debate, was subjected to a wrenching reorganization by
then-Secretary James Watt in 1981. When Christensen took over, some
violation records were still stored in shoeboxes.
   Christensen said most of the $150 million in penalties
represented by those boxes would be written off by the end of this
fiscal year, with about 15 percent of the amount finally collected,
and the records now kept on a computer.
   His tenure also has seen installation of another computer system
to match applicants for mining permits in the states against the
list of outstanding violations, and the abolition by Congress of
the exemption from most regulation for mines under two acres. That
exemption had enabled some big companies in Virginia and Kentucky
to break their operations into a ``string of pearls'' _ mines of
less than two acres operated by subcontractors.
   ``I'm amazed at the things we've accomplished,'' he said,
listing among other things better relations with the states and
forthcoming proposals for criminal penalties for mining without a
permit and for incentives for miners to take coal from and reclaim
abandoned mines.
   Thomas Galloway, a Washington lawyer who has represented
environmental groups in several lawsuits against the agency, said
Christensen's departure was ``not a major move,'' since ``he was
not involved in major issues over the past year ... we have been
dealing with the assistant secretary's office.''
   Galloway said he believed the office was ``probably in the worst
shape it's been since 1977'' in terms of competence and
effectiveness, which he said was ``not entirely the Reagan
administration's fault.''
   ``I believe abuse is continuing unchecked'' in parts of
Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia and Tennessee, largely at the
hands of miners operating on a shoestring, Galloway said.
   Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., who as chairman of the environment
subcommittee of the House Government Operations Committee has
produced several reports critical of the office, said a change in
directors ``will be meaningless, just like all the others have
been.''

   Off-duty police gathered signatures at polling
places Tuesday in a drive to abolish a citizens review board, but
said they abandoned their efforts at one site after being
confronted by a City Council member.
   ``In at least one of the polling places, we had to leave because
(Mayor Pro Tem) Diane Ragsdale and some of her cohorts started to
create problems, so we just decided to leave because it was not
worth it,'' said Dallas Police Association President Monica Smith.
   ``Ms. Ragsdale started an argument, trying to convince people
not to sign the petitions, and rather than getting it to escalate,
we pulled out,'' said Ms. Smith.
   Ms. Ragsdale, a vocal critic of the police, said there was no
confrontation.
   ``This gentleman wanted to know from me what to do. He wanted to
know about the issue because, you know, many of them _ actually,
some of our citizens, seniors _ really don't know,'' she said.
   ``They do not realize what they are doing,'' she said. ``They
attempted to circumvent their policy makers.''
   But one DPA spokesman, Larry McGowan, said Ms. Ragsdale grabbed
one man trying to sign a petition.
   Ms. Smith said signatures were being collected citywide by about
1,400 off-duty officers, 200 to 300 firefighters and their
families. The campaign to abolish the Dallas Citizens Police Review
Board has drawn opposition from a coalition of black business,
community, church and elected leaders.
   The DPA wants the city to hire more officers and abolish the
board, which hears complaints against police. The board was formed
in January and has met twice.
   Twenty thousand signatures are needed to force a City Charter
amendment election.
   The Texas secretary of state had poll monitors at voting places,
also observing the police effort.
   Three Dallas officers have been shot and killed this year,
including John Chase, who was shot by a deranged transient as a
bus-stop crowd watched the homeless man ignore the officer's pleas
to spare his life.
   Four men have also been killed by officers this year, including
the transient who killed Chase.
   Opponents of the citizens review board, which has limited
subpoena powers, say it duplicates existing panels or agencies,
including the police internal affairs department and the Dallas
County grand jury, and calls into question the department's ability
to police itself.

   Northwest lawmakers and representatives of the
timber industry said Tuesday the new U.S.-Canada free trade treaty
will do little to open Canadian markets to American-manufactured
plywood, but Reagan administration officials said it was a step in
the right direction.
   ``It's one-way free trade,'' Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., said
during a House subcommittee hearing. ``The U.S. is being snookered
again.''
   Both DeFazio and Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said the treaty will
allow Canadian plywood manufacturers unrestricted access to
American markets but only 10 percent of the Canadian market, at
best, will be opened to U.S. producers.
   ``I think a provision like this provides red meat to the
protectionists,'' said Wyden, adding that Congress should draft
strong language covering plywood trade when it consider
implementing language for the treaty later this year.
   Oregon is the top plywood producing state in the nation and
Washington state ranks No. 4. Other states in the top five include
Louisiana, Texas and Arkansas.

   An arms dealer charged with plotting to sell
weapons to Argentina, Iraq, Poland and the Soviet Union was asked
by U.S. intelligence officials to use his contacts in Poland to
arrange the purchase of two Soviet ``super tanks,'' his attorney
said Tuesday.
   Solomon Schwartz, 52, of Monsey, was sought out by the CIA in
1982 and later had contact with the Defense Intelligence Agency
concerning the possible purchase of the Soviet T-72 tanks, which
the U.S. government wanted to study for intelligence purposes, said
attorney Lawrence Dubin.
   Schwartz negotiated with three Polish generals for the tanks but
the sale never materialized, Dubin said in his opening statement at
the trial of Schwartz and three co-defendants, who are also arms
dealers.
   The defendants are accused of plotting four illegal weapons
deals, including smuggling military equipment to the Argentinian
government during the Falkland Islands War and an unsuccessful
attempt to ship guns to Iraq.
   ``They were willing to sell to anyone, no matter whose hands the
weapons fell into, if the price was right,'' said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Larry Krantz.
   The Argentinian deal, the only one that went through, included
the shipment of 1,300 night vision goggles and resulted in a profit
of $1 million for the defendants, Krantz said.
   The prosecutor charged that Schwartz would use the Soviet tank
deal to ``cover up'' one of the illegal arms deals, a shipment of
500 automatic rifles and ammunition destined for Poland but seized
by U.S. Customs agents at John F. Kennedy Airport in February 1984.
   Dubin said the weapons were to be shipped to Poland but then
would be immediately re-shipped to Mexico, using a legal export
license, by an independent trading company.
   He said the arms shipment to Poland was needed to establish ``a
course of routine business'' in Poland to facilitate any possible
future dealings involving the Soviet tanks.
   Schwartz, the owner of Texas Armament Advisors Inc., will
testify during the trial about the tank deal, Dubin said.
   The other illegal arms shipments alleged in the indictment
involved 110 boxes of handguns, shotguns and ammunition destined
for Iraq but seized by Belgian authorities; and 400 night vision
devices to the Soviet Union in a sting operation orchestrated by
U.S. Customs. All took place between 1982 and 1984.
   ``Although these weapons are routinely bought and sold in the
U.S., the export of these weapons are highly regulated by the
government,'' Krantz said. ``The defendants were caught red-handed
participating in a series of illegal arms transactions.''
   The other defendants are H. Leonard Berg, 52, of the Bronx,
owner of HLB Security Electronics Ltd. of Manhattan; Grim
DePanicis, 44, of Mount Dora, Fla., a vice president of HLB; Leon
Lisbona, 63, of Queens, an HLB employee.
   Berg, Lisbona and Schwartz are charged with racketeering,
racketeering conspiracy, wire fraud and violating arms export laws
and are accused of participating in all four illegal deals.
   DePanicis is not charged with any of the racketeering counts and
is named only in the Argentinian and Soviet Union deals.
   Krantz said the trial was expected to last several weeks and
would include secretly recorded conversations.

   Thousands of Japanese-Americans detained in
prison camps during World War II suffered a ``catastrophic
deprivation of civil rights,'' an attorney told a federal appeals
court Tuesday.
   But the arguments by the attorney representing 120,000
Japanese-Americans in a $24 billion class-action suit and by the
Justice Department lawyer fighting the suit were far removed from
the gruesome details of what appeals court Judge Helen Nies
described as ``a disgrace we all know and lived through.''
   Instead, the hearing before the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit focused mainly on whether the statute of
limitations had expired in the case.
   This is the second time a federal appeals court has heard the
case. In 1986, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia ruled that the government must defend itself at trial
against the suit, which seeks compensation for property losses
suffered by those interned.
   In doing so, it overturned a 1984 decision by District Court
Judge Louis Oberdorfer, who had ruled that a six-year statute of
limitations on suits against the government had expired.
   But the Supreme Court ruled last June that the issue of whether
the lawsuit was filed within the legal deadline should have been
decided by a different court _ the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit.
   The only time the Supreme Court has ruled on the internment
itself _ authorized by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the wake
of the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor _ was in 1944, when it
found it was a constitutionally acceptable military necessity.
Government documents discovered later indicate no such military
necessity existed.
   ``This case involves the catastrophic deprivation of civil
rights,'' said Benjamin Zelenko, attorney for William Hohri of
Chicago, the lead plaintiff in the class-action suit.
   Hohri, a San Francisco native who lived in southern California
when the war began, said Tuesday he was interned at Manzanar camp
east of the Sierra Nevada shortly after his 15th birthday. He left
for the Midwest 2{ years later and never returned to California.
   Zelenko argued that the statute of limitations did not come into
play until the early 1980s because of ``deliberate concealment and
misrepresentation by the government of critical information
regarding its claim of `military necessity.'''
   The concealment didn't end until the 1980s, Zelenko said, when a
congressionally appointed commission found that there was no
military necessity for the internment. The policy was ``driven by
race prejudice, war hysteria and lack of political leadership,'' he
told the three-judge panel of Giles Rich, Phillip Baldwin and Nies.
   Jay Bybee, representing the government, told the court, ``There
is no dispute that there were great wrongs done to
Japanese-Americans.... But even when mistakes are made, people must
file timely claims for redress....
   ``The plaintiffs have known the basis of their claims since the
1940s,'' said Bybee, who contended that they didn't file their suit
at that time because they believed the government would have been
successful in claiming military necessity for its actions.

   The death of Bill Britt, whose body was found in
his woods shelter alone and partially devoured by animals,
symbolized the fate of society's homeless and eccentric people, a
housing court official said Tuesday.
   Autopsy results Tuesday showed that Britt, 52, died of
hypothermia and was dead two weeks before he was discovered Monday
by two of his three children in his makeshift wigwam in Brookline,
according to the Suffolk County medical examiner's report.
   ``Homeless people, people like Britt who say they want to be
alone, should be protected in this weather,'' said Stanton Kessler,
a senior pathologist in the medical examiner's office. ``He had no
food in him. He had no sleeping bag. This type of thing should be
prevented.''
   Kessler said Britt was clothed and wrapped in blankets when he
died. Identification was ``presumptive,'' he said, because rodents
had eaten most of his face, hands and fingers. His feet were intact
because they had been dug into the ground and covered with dirt,
for warmth, Kessler said.
   Britt died in the woods near the Chestnut Hill Reservoir, near
the affluent community of the same name where he was born and grew
up. He had lived in the woods since 1969 and did not attract much
attention until 1985, when officials began trying to move him into
public or subsidized housing.
   Britt's continual resistance to being moved brought him national
attention and his nickname, ``the hermit of Chestnut Hill.'' At one
point, actor Mickey Rooney planned to buy the rights to his story.
Last May he appeared on ``Late Night with David Letterman.''
   Chief Housing Court Justice E. George Daher tried to arrange
housing and medical aid for Britt despite his repeated lack of
cooperation.
   ``He represents in a microcosm what happens to the homeless, the
unfortunates, the eccentrics in this cold society,'' Daher said
Tuesday. ``No one seemed to care about him. He should have been
monitored. Someone should have checked in on him, rather than have
him die a lonely tragic death like this.''
   There are more than 3,400 homeless people in the Boston area,
according to the city Emergency Shelter Commission director, Anne
Maguire. She said about 150 of them are outside much of the time.
   But Britt was unique, she said, adding, ``Most people want
shelter.''
   Others also agreed Britt did not fit the typical definition of
the homeless or mentally ill.
   A one-time insurance agent who also worked in Procter & Gamble's
marketing division in New York City 30 years ago, Britt had been
married with a family. Many speculated that a reportedly messy
divorce in 1969 fueled his change in lifestyle.
   Both public officials and friends said he was a paradox; a loner
who loved to chat with Boston College students who went to class
just yards from his shelter, an eccentric who said he wanted to be
left alone but who regularly pitched stories about himself to the
media.
   The Britt children recently were in fairly regular contact with
him. Ingrid Boughner, 28, his daughter, who learned last year that
her father was the well-known hermit, said she visited him several
times over the last few weeks, leaving him sandwiches and notes
that were never touched. Britt's body was found dead by her and her
brother, Britton Boughner.
   Mary Callahan, 27, met Britt as a reporter on a local weekly
newspaper. She was one of the first to write about him.
   ``It seems so sad to me,'' said Callahan, now on the editorial
staff of Boston College's in-house newspaper. ``He was a singular
person, a very interesting man. He looked very old but he was so
articulate. He talked about writing poetry, about writing books.
It's strange that he decided to live there.''
   Bill Blacker, a box clerk at the Chestnut Hill Post Office, said
Britt came in almost daily to check the mail box he paid $11 for
every six months.
   ``He talked like such an educated man,'' said Blacker. ``I sure
wouldn't have wanted to live that way but at least he did what he
chose to do. I just think something drastic must have happened to
him to make him want to live like that.''

   Sales of U.S. savings bonds increased for the

million, the government reported Tuesday.
   The Treasury Department said that February sales were $13
million higher than January and were 2 percent above the level of a
year ago, when sales were $646 million.
   With the inclusion of interest earnings, the value of
outstanding bonds rose by $1 billion to total $103.24 billion, 10
percent higher than a year ago.
   Since November 1982, savings bonds held five years or longer
have earned market-based interest rates. The current rate, in
effect until May 1, is 7.17 percent.

   Former Interior Secretary William Clark
was hospitalized after erratic winds flipped his plane as it took
off from his private airstrip, his wife said Tuesday.
   ``He had a little mishap with his small plane,'' said Joan
Clark. ``It isn't serious. He will be out in a day or so.''
   Clark was taken to Twin Cities Hospital in San Luis Obispo for
observation after Monday's accident. The hospital referred all
calls to the family business, the Clark Company, which is involved
in real estate and other ventures.
   Clark, 56, was alone at the controls of his Super Cub aircraft
when winds jarred the plane at the family ranch, 160 miles
northwest of Los Angeles, Mrs. Clark said.
   The plane overturned and didn't get airborne, she said.
   Clark, who said his job as interior secretary was the most
satisfying in decades of public service, resigned Jan. 1, 1985, and
returned to his California ranch, about 50 miles north of Reagan's
spread in Santa Barbara.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service on Tuesday
reminded Americans of the newest tax they face: a levy on vaccines
that protect against childhood diseases.
   Under a law that Congress passed and President Reagan signed
last December, a tax of up to $4.56 was imposed on shots. The tax
must be paid to the government by the manufacturer, producer or
importer but nothing in the law prohibits it from being passed on
to the patient.
   The IRS issued a routine announcement noting that the tax
applies to vaccines sold after Dec. 31. The money will be used to
compensate people who are injured or who die from receiving
commonly prescribed vaccines after Sept. 30, 1988.
   The amount paid in claims, which must be filed in U.S. District
Court, will be limited by the size of the vaccine fund.
   The tax is $4.56 for a dose of DPT (diphtheria, whooping cough
and tetanus) vaccine; 6 cents for diphtheria and tetanus; $4.44 for
measles, mumps and rubella, and 29 cents for polio.

<HEAD>Scalia Warns That Budget Cut Would Hurt Court's Operations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia told a
House subcommittee Tuesday that trimming the high court's $16.4
budget request could ``cut not fat, not muscle but bone.''
   Scalia, submitting a budget request for the fiscal year that
begins next October, warned that the court cannot withstand an
appropriations reduction similar to one imposed for its current
budget.
   ``We come close to becoming the proverbial turnip'' from which
no more blood can be squeezed, Scalia said.
   The court last year requested $16 million for its current,
fiscal year 1988 budget but only $15.2 million was appropriated.
   ``This has put a very serious strain on the operations of the
court during the current fiscal year,'' Scalia said.
   The fiscal year 1989 request includes:
   _$100,000 for increased library shelving capacity.
   _$40,000 to upgrade into legal research databases the word
processors the justices and their law clerks use.
   _$50,000 to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the federal law
that created the federal court system.
   The Supreme Court's budget is handled separately from the
billion-dollar budget of the federal court system but most of the
subcommittee's questions, focused on problems facing the federal
judiciary generally.
   Rep. Joseph D. Early, D-Mass., asked several questions about
what he apparently views as dwindling judicial efficiency.
   Noting that ``there are a lot more laws out there,'' Scalia
said, ``You simply cannot lay too much additional responsibility
upon this institution (the federal courts) without fundamentally
changing'' it.
   Responding to a similar question by Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz.,
Scalia said the caseload problem facing federal courts ``originates
right here (in Congress) and I don't see an answer to it.''

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and Britain on Tuesday
vetoed a Security Council resolution to impose economic sanctions
on South Africa in an effort to end apartheid.
   The measure failed by a vote of 10-2, with France, West Germany
and Japan abstaining.
   The resolution would have imposed mandatory worldwide sanctions,
including an oil embargo, for a year.
   All the speakers deplored South Africa's state of emergency and
recent restrictions on anti-apartheid groups.
   In their speeches, the representatives of France and Italy
condemned Pretoria's ban on activities by major anti-apartheid
groups and urged dialogue between the white-led government and the
black majority. However, the representatives did not endorse
mandatory sanctions.
   The United States and some other Western nations have opposed
similar measures in the past. The five permanent members of the
Security Council _ the United States, Britain, China, France and
the Soviet Union _ have veto power.
   The resolution proposed a ban on export and sale of oil to South
Africa, the discontinuation of iron and steel imports from South
Africa, an end to loans to South Africa, a ban on sale of coins
minted in South Africa and a halt to all military, police or
intelligence cooperation with South Africa.
   In Johannesburg, Foreign Minister Pik Botha said on national
television that ``I wrote the words'' used by South Africa's U.N.
ambassador, Leslie Manley, last Thursday when he told the council,
``Do your damnedest.''
   ``Either we're strong enough to withstand and resist the
onslaught against us or we're not,'' Botha said.
   The draft resolution invoked Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter,
which provides for economic sanctions and other measures when
international peace and security are threatened.
   Last Thursday the council opened a debate to condemn South
Africa's ban Feb. 24 on activities by major anti-apartheid groups.
It is expected to pass a resolution expressing outrage and
condemnation.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   Four suspects in the killing of a rookie police
officer as he sat in a patrol car were indicted Tuesday,
authorities said.
   Todd Scott, 19, Scott Cobb, 24, Philip Copeland, 22; and David
McClary, 22, were indicted on charges of second-degree murder and
criminal possession of a weapon, said Richard Piperno, spokesman
for the district attorney's office.
   Edward Byrne, 22, was shot in the head Feb. 26 as he sat in his
car guarding the home of a man who had complained about crack
dealing in the borough of Queens.
   All four suspects have been held without bail since pleading
innocent at arraignments Friday and Saturday.
   Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward said police believe a major
drug dealer ordered the hit. The arrests followed a week-long
investigation that included a roundup of 294 suspected dealers in
Queens.
   Ward said the suspects met in a Queens apartment Feb. 25 to plan
the murder of a police officer. Police alleged that Copeland was at
the planning session, but not the slaying.
   It was not known who pulled the trigger. McClary and Scott have
pointed the finger at each other, police said.

   He calls himself Dee Jay, says he is 17 and
ran away from New York City. But beyond that, sheriff's deputies
say they have no idea who he is or how to help him.
   ``This kid has been in limbo for 17 years _ or more. He doesn't
know who he is or anything,'' Montgomery County Chief Deputy Gary
Haines said Monday.
   Haines appealed for public help to identify Dee Jay, saying
routine missing-person checks and other leads have turned up
nothing since the man was arrested outside a bar March 2.
   Dee Jay appears to have a severe learning disability, Haines
said. He also told investigators he may have been involved in
pornography films and other abuse, Haines said.
   Dee Jay was picked up after deputies were called to investigate
a car burglar alarm outside a bar, Haines said.
   ``His explanation is that he heard the alarm go off while he was
in the lounge,'' said Claudia Marlin, the department's victim
advocate. She said he was in the lounge because, ``they have free
hors d'oeuvres and he was hungry.''
   Dee Jay was not charged and is in the custody of the Montgomery
County Children Services Board, Haines said. He cannot read or use
a telephone and can barely write, Haines said.
   He is described as black, 6-foot-2, weighing about 150 pounds,
with black hair and brown eyes. He was wearing a black-and-silver
sweater and washed jeans, Haines said.
   Dee Jay told Ms. Marlin he lived with a man named Rick in a
three-bedroom apartment in the New York City borough of the Bronx.
He said he got occasional tutoring and once was treated by a doctor
for the flu, she said.
   He said he hitchhiked from the Bronx on a truck, ended up in
Dayton around Christmas and slept in trucks and in doorways, Ms.
Marlin said.

   The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization
criticized the United States Tuesday for its questions about how
the agency handles its money and hires employees.
   Fred J. Eckert, U.S. ambassador to the agency, sent a letter to
FAO Director-General Edouard Saouma seeking details of agency
spending, hiring practices and Saouma's compensation package.
   ``These are serious and important questions,'' Eckert said
Tuesday.
   Agency spokesman Richard Lydiker said: ``The director-general
regrets that requests for information have been presented as
aspersions on the management and reputation of the FAO. As requests
for information they are legitimate. But as aspersions they are
groundless.''
   ``Throughout his entire term of office the director-general has
scrupulously observed (the agency's) rules and regulations and this
will be demonstrated in his reply to the permanent representative
of the United States,'' Lydiker said, reading from a statement.
   He also noted that the United States has not paid its
contribution to the agency. Lydiker said earlier this year that the
United States owes $68 million from its 1986-87 assessment, which
amounts to a quarter of the agency's budget.
   Saouma, a Lebanese, was elected to a third six-year term in
November, defeating an African challenger supported by the United
States and other major donor nations.
   The United States and other nations have called for reforms at
the organization, which coordinates agricultural projects in
developing countries and is the largest specialized agency in the
United Nations.
   Last November, a 1988-89 FAO budget of $492 million was approved
over objections from the United States, Britain, Australia and
Canada.
   ``In the course of our review, we have become increasingly
concerned about reports portraying FAO in an extremely unfavorable
light. The questions that we shall be putting to you are for the
purpose of getting at the truth of these matters,'' Eckert said in
his letter, dated March 3.
   The letter also asked for an explanation about travel expenses
for delegates to a recent agency conference, the agency's purchase
of cars and details of entertainment allowances.
   It asked how many former ambassadors were on the agency's
payroll and whether relatives of current or former ambassadors work
for the agency.

   Winter wheat planted last fall for harvest
this summer is in ``mostly good to fair'' condition in some of the
nation's major production areas, a government report said Tuesday.
   The Joint Agricultural Weather Facility said wheat during the
week of Feb. 29 through March 6 was not quite in such good shape in
the northern Great Plains, Delta and Rocky Mountain states, however.
   ``Snow cover was virtually nonexistent in the central and
northern Great Plain and Rocky Mountain states, but mild
temperatures kept damage at a minimum,'' the report said. ``Snow,
preceding freezing temperatures, prevented severe winter damage to
small grain (including wheat) in eastern Kansas, northern Oklahoma,
Illinois, Missouri, Indiana and Ohio.''
   Crop development by early March ranged from greening in Colorado
to jointing of plants in Mississippi and Oklahoma, and heading in
Arizona, the report said.
   The facility is operated by the departments of Commerce and
Agriculture. Reports do not forecast actual production of crops,
only the condition of fields and plants.

   Congress was urged by a trio of witnesses
Tuesday to increase economic and diplomatic pressure on Haiti to
spur a return to democratic rule.
   But the Latin American director of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, a Washington-based conservative think tank,
called on the United States to restore aid to Haiti.
   The witness, Georges Fauriol, said the new government of Haitian
President Leslie Manigat ``deserves encouragement and resources _
rather than further sanctions and further hardship for the Haitian
people.''
   ``Barring gross misjudgment and behavior on the part of the new
government, the United States, at a minimum, should reinstate the
aid package cut off last November,'' Fauriol said.
   But other witnesses disagreed.
   Rep. George W. Crockett Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the House
Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Western Hemisphere affairs, said
Washington needs to make clear ``that the United States government
will use every diplomatic, political and economic means at our
disposal to help accomplish a free and fair election in Haiti.''
   A Haitian journalist, Raymond A. Joseph, urged Manigat to call
new elections and order the investigation of politically inspired
killings.
   Michael S. Hooper, executive director of the National Coalition
for Haitian Refugees, said the Reagan administration would end the
hope for free and fair elections in Haiti if it moves to embrace
the Manigat government, which was installed after Haiti's military
forces broke up earlier presidential elections.
   ``The United States should immediately institute and recommend a
complete (international) arms embargo and an end to all assistance
that frees up domestic resources allowing the government to sustain
the growing army,'' Hooper said.
   Patrick Bellegarde-Smith, an author specializing in Haiti and
its problems, called on the United States to continue the aid
cutoff, to oppose all loans to Haiti by international lending
institutions, to withdraw Haiti's privileges under the Caribbean
Basin Initiative, and to insist Haiti restore democratic government
and end the use of the country as a haven for narcotics trafficking.

<HEAD>DOE Won't Get Extra Funds for Super-Collider Site Evaluation</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The congressional appropriations committees
have denied a request by the Energy Department to shift $8 million
to pay for evaluation of possible sites for the $4.4 billion
super-collider atom smasher, the department said Tuesday.
   ``We are looking at our options,'' department spokesman Jeff
Sherwood said.
   The department is seeking $363 million in the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1 to begin construction of the collider, a
53-miles-around tunnel that would smash beams of protons into each
other.
   Last year it requested $25 million for design and $10 million
for early construction work that was not tied to a site, but
Congress approved only the $25 million.
   Sherwood said the department had not sought site evaluation
funds until it knew how many sites it would have to deal with.
Twenty-five states submitted proposals for 35 sites, a list that
was narrowed to seven finalists in December.
   Until recently the department had planned to write an
environmental impact statement only for its final choice, expected
to be made tentatively in July, but last month Secretary John
Herrington told Congress that choice would be delayed until
November, and the department said it would assess environmental
impacts for all seven sites.
   There is substantial congressional opposition to the heavy
spending required for the project. Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La.,
chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and also of
the energy and water development subcommittee of the Appropriations
Committee, warned Herrington that the department might not get all
the money it was seeking in the new fiscal year.
   The $8 million would have been shifted from general
administrative funds of the department for the current fiscal year.
   Sherwood said the department could take evaluation funds from
the $25 million, at the cost of slowing down design of the magnets
that guide the proton beams, or could delay the evaluations,
perhaps at the cost of pushing the site selection decision into the
next administration.
   ``We would very much like to keep to our planned schedule,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   Rising production costs and a weakening dollar
overseas are forcing the Washington Opera to raise ticket prices
and reduce the number of performances next season, officials said
Tuesday. The best orchestra seats will sell for $60, up from $49.50
this year.
   Despite the first major boost in ticket prices since 1981,
general director Martin Feinstein said the opera still must raise
$300,000 privately to stage a new production of Giacomo Puccini's
``Tosca'' for its season opener in the Kennedy Center Opera House
on Nov. 5.
   Tenor Placido Domingo will star in that production, which will
be directed by Gian Carlo Menotti and conducted by Rafael Fruhbeck
de Burgos.
   Other season highlights will include Peter Tchaikovsky's ``Pique
Dame'' (The Queen of Spades), conducted by Mstislav Rostropovich
and directed by his wife, Galina Vishnevskaya, and Stephen Paulus'
``The Postman Always Rings Twice,'' a 1982 musical adaptation of
James M. Cain's Depression-era novel.
   The cheapest seats in Washington will sell for $20 in the
Kennedy Center's Eisenhower Theater, where smaller operas are
staged, and standing room remains $10. Students and senior citizens
can still buy half-price tickets.
   Feinstein blamed the increase on mounting production costs and a
50 percent decline in the value of the dollar abroad in the past
three years, which makes it more expensive to hire Domingo and
other foreign singers.
   The budget squeeze also forced Feinstein to reduce the number of
performances from 66 to 48 next season and to present seven instead
of the current eight operas.

<HEAD>Leaders Request Meeting With Reagan Over Rights Legislation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan was asked Tuesday to meet
with the nation's civil rights leaders, who are trying to prevent a
veto of legislation to restore full anti-discrimination protection
to women, minorities, the handicapped and the elderly.
   The request came in a letter from the chairman and executive
director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, who said
that Reagan has rarely met with civil rights leaders during his
seven years in office.
   ``Now is the time for reconciliation, not for confrontation,''
said Chairman Benjamin L. Hooks and Executive Director Ralph G.
Neas, who asked for a meeting ``as soon as possible.''
   The leadership conference includes all the major civil rights
groups. There was no immediate White House response.
   Reagan has threatened to veto the Civil Rights Restoration Act,
which passed the House 315-98 and the Senate, 75-14 _ margins large
enough to override a rejection by the president.
   The civil rights leaders said the legislation would restore full
federal civil rights protections in public and private
institutions, and state and local governments receiving federal
money. Those protections were limited by a 1984 Supreme Court
decision involving Grove City College in Pennsylvania.
   Reagan, however, said the bill would actually expand federal
jurisdiction beyond pre-Grove City limits.
   Hooks, head of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, and Neas, wrote Reagan, ``Contrary to what some
have said, the Restoration Act is not an expansion of federal
power.''
   And they added, ``a presidential veto of a bill to end federal
funding of discrimination would leave a terrible and lasting stain
on your presidency.''

   At the Pike's Landing bar, the regulars
have a curious way of telling spring is near _ they wait for the
first truck or car to break through the ice of the Chena River.
   Gary Halmstad earned that dubious distinction Monday. His 1979
van broke through 8 inches of ice as he started across an ice
bridge used as a winter shortcut by many residents.
   ``I hate being this kind of harbinger of spring,'' he said.
   The ice cracked between the front and back tires, and he
summoned a small wrecker to pull him off. Instead, the tow truck
pulled the front tires off a supporting shelf of ice, and the front
of the van plunged into about 5 feet of water. He planned to call a
larger wrecker to pull the van out the rest of the way.
   ``I'm glad it wasn't in the middle,'' he said. ``I suppose I
should giggle. All I have to do is pay money for a tow truck and
drain the engine.''
   The dunking was the earliest that bar patrons could recall.

   Several California lawmakers are
trying not to be spineless as they defend their decision to make
the banana slug the official state mollusk.
   The state Governmental Orginization Committee on Tuesday endured
slimy jabs about the slug, including comparisons to its garlicky
cousin, escargot, before sliding the bill out of committee on a
12-2 vote.
   The legislation, authored by democratic Assemblyman Byron Sher,
now inches onto the Assembly floor.
   Sher introduced the bill at the urging of the Dynamite Blue Bird
troop of Redwood City. Six members of the inveterate invertebrate
supporters testified before the committee and brought along six
banana slugs.
   The state has several official mascots, such as the California
gray whale as the marine mammal and the California dog-faced
butterful as the state insect. But it has no mollusk, which is a
large phylum of invertebrate animals that includes octopi, abalone,
mussels, snails and slugs.
   Blue Bird Susanna Farley said the banana slug should be the
state mollusk because ``they're native to the West Coast and live
in redwood forests, which is the state tree, and also they eat
poison oak and that's very helpful.''
   ``Can we make escargot out of them?'' inquired Assemblyman
Curtis Tucker.
   ``I have no inherent objection to the state mollusk being such a
useful, slimy, oozy thing,'' said Assemblyman Nolan Frizzelle.
   Assemblyman Trice Harvey tried unsuccessfully to make the state
mollusk the abalone, saying they taste better and are not ``yucky
yellow creatures that hide out in the mountains.''

   Iran and Iraq fired missiles at each
other's cities Tuesday and the Iraqis said their warplanes raided
an Iranian oil tanker. It was the first reported attack on Persian
Gulf shipping in weeks.
   Iran claimed either the United States or France had helped Iraq
modify Soviet-built missiles so they could reach Tehran for the
first time since the war began in September 1980.
   The United States greeted with skepticism a surprise call by the
Soviet Union for the U.N. Security Council to condemn the ``war of
the cities.''
   Iraq said it fired two surface-to-surface rockets at Isfahan in
central Iran in the first missile attack on that city in the
nine-day-old missile duel. It said three missiles were fired into
Tehran and one at the holy city of Qom.
   Tehran radio said 12 civilians were killed when the missiles
struck residential areas in the three cities, damaging houses,
shops and a medical center.
   Iraq has reported hitting Tehran with 43 missiles since Feb. 29
and Iran says it has fired 23 into Baghdad.
   Iran said it fired a missile Tuesday into Amarah, an Iraqi town
halfway between Baghdad and the southern port of Basra, and two at
Mosul, an important northern oil center. Iraq reported casualties
but did not specify how many.
   Iran has said 134 people have been killed and more than 300
wounded in the latest round of the ``war of the cities.'' Iraq says
there have been many civilian casualties, but has not mentioned
figures.
   A dispatch from the official Iraqi News Agency said warplanes
raided a ``very large naval target'' off Iran. The phrase usually
means an Iranian supertanker.
   Maritime sources said they had no information about the raid,
which would be the first confirmed attack on a commercial ship in
the gulf since Feb. 12. More than 400 have been hit in the 7{ years
of war.
   Hashemi Rafsanjani, speaker of Iran's Parliament, said the
missiles being fired by Iraq are Soviet-made Scud-Bs, which
previously have been used against Iranian border cities.
   ``In order to increase the range of the missiles, they have been
clumsily tampered with,'' he said. ``There is no doubt that the
major powers did this, such as America or France.''
   Rafsanjani said Iranian military experts had examined several
unexploded missiles and concluded ``that although such missiles
were originally made in Russia, most of the Eastern Bloc countries
manufacture or assemble this missile today, and Iraq can obtain it
from other sources.''
   Western military experts have said the missiles are Scud-Bs
fitted with strap-on boosters enabling them to reach Tehran and
Qom, which are nearly 300 miles from the border.
   The missile normally carries a 1,000-pound warhead and has a
range of 190 miles. Western experts say Iran also uses Scud-Bs,
supplied by its Arab allies Syria and Libya, but it does not need
boosters because Baghdad is only 80 miles from the frontier.
   At the United Nations in New York, Soviet Ambassador Alexander
M. Belonogov told reporters Monday the Security Council must act to
prevent ``further escalation of the military conflict,'' but evaded
a question about whether the Kremlin would approve an arms embargo.
   U.S. Ambassador Herbert Okun said a Soviet resolution on the
``war of the cities'' should not ``undercut or erode'' council
Resolution 598 of July 20, which demanded an immediate cease-fire.

   Gallaudet University students on Tuesday
boycotted classes to protest the hiring of a hearing woman as the
school for the deaf's next president, while a faculty leader said a
growing number of instructors favor a deaf leader.
   The boycott of classes highlighted a second consecutive day of
stormy protest over the hiring of Elisabeth Ann Zinser, an
administrator with the University of North Carolina at Greensboro
who prevailed over two deaf finalists.
   At an afternoon rally at the school's football field, students
burned effigies of Zinser and board of trustees chairwoman Jane
Bassett Spilman. More than 1,500 students roared their approval in
strong voices and flashing fingers.
   The rally highlighted a day in which most of the school's 1,800
undergraduate and graduate students skipped classes, and nearly a
third of the school's 274 full-time professors did not show up to
teach.
   ``I'm missing an art history test today, and my grades will
probably be hurt,'' said 26-year-old Eric Spanbauer, a sophomore
government major from Decatur, Ill. ``I'm not going to let my deaf
rights get hurt. I've been waiting too long. This is our time.''
   Psychology professor Neil Reynolds, who chairs the school's
21-member faculty senate and a larger group that includes all the
university's faculty, said a growing number of instructors are
advocating a deaf president.
   ``There has been in the past week an escalation of overt support
from faculty members for a deaf president,'' said Reynolds. ``That
is definitely a change.''
   Both the faculty senate and the larger group of instructors will
meet Wednesday to discuss the ongoing controversy, said Reynolds.
   About 30 percent of Gallaudet's professors are deaf, while
nearly 22 percent of the school's support staff is deaf, according
to university publicist Barbara Dennis.
   Students took heart from the support from their mentors, and
were cheered to know that alumni of the nation's only liberal arts
college for the deaf were standing by them.
   ``The alumni sympathize with and support the students,'' Gerald
Burstein, president of the school's alumni association, said at an
afternoon rally. ``We _ unlike hearing members on the board _ know
fully what it is like to be deaf. Those members of the board who
lack confidence in the abilities of deaf persons ... should
resign.''
   Off-campus groups have also rallied behind the students.
   Fred Weiner, a Washington spokesman for the National Association
of the Deaf, said state leaders from his 20,000 member organization
were planning to meet in Washington on Friday to discuss ways of
helping students gain a deaf president.
   Students say they will not stop their protest until Zinser is
replaced with a deaf president, Spilman is replaced, and the
university agrees to make deaf persons a majority on the school's
20-member board of trustees. The board now has just four deaf
members.
   Spilman said Tuesday that the board will stand by its decision
to hire Zinser, vice chancellor of academic affairs at Greensboro.
   ``It was not the intention of the board of trustees to create
turmoil on campus,'' Spilman said in a telephone interview. ``It
was a vote cast in the best interests of the university, and
Elisabeth Ann Zinser was selected for one and only one reason _ she
was the most qualified person.''

   Three federal appellate judges Tuesday upheld
a lower court's finding that there was no evidence General Motors
Corp. knowingly sold 1.1 million 1980 X-cars with alleged brake
defects.
   The panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington
affirmed U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's 1987
rejection of government claims that the cars had an inherent defect
that caused rear brakes to lock up prematurely and spin out of
control under certain circumstances.
   Jackson had ruled against the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, which had sought to fine GM $4 million and order a
complete recall of the 1.1 million 1980 models of Chevrolet
Citation, Pontiac Phoenix, Buick Skylark and Oldsmobile Omega.
   The suit was filed in 1983 after the agency received more than
4,000 complaints from drivers that the cars spun out of control
after the brakes had locked. Without conceding there was a defect,
GM had previously agreed to two recalls, which the government said
were inadequate to deal with the problem.
   In its ruling Tuesday, the appeals court rejected the
government's argument that Jackson had improperly rejected the
testimony of drivers who said they believed the skidding was caused
by defective brakes.
   ``We agree with the district court that the drivers were in no
position to know if the rear-wheel lockup was, in fact, premature
in view of the particular breaking application and driving
parameters involved in each incident,'' the panel said in an
opinion by Circuit Judge Kenneth Starr.
   ``Drivers cannot assess with reasonable accuracy the external
variables that may contribute to a skid, no matter how rich their
experience or concentrated their attention may be,'' the court said.
   GM, in a statement released in Detroit, said, ``Today's decision
more than justifies our determination to stay the course and defend
the 1980 X-car through long and costly and highly-publicized
litigation.''
   ``The Appeals Court has given added assurance to the owners of
1980 and later models of the X-car that they may drive those cars
with confidence,'' it said.
   The government did not have any immediate reaction to Tuesday's
ruling.
   In his opinion last April, Jackson concluded that ``there is
simply no engineering evidence of any peculiar property of the
X-car generally that renders them in any way exceptional insofar as
having a predisposition to yaw (turn).''
   The appeals court panel also rejected the government's argument
that Jackson improperly considered GM test data that was taken
after the case was filed.
   The government contended the test data was based on an
insufficient sample of X-cars and ``peer cars'' that had similar
brakes. This data demonstrated that X-cars were no more likely to
skid than similar vehicles. It also showed that skidding of X-cars
was not caused by a brake malfunction.
   ``It would have been odd for the district court to have
dismissed all this data as irrelevant in assessing the
probabilities that the vehicle, rather than other factors, was
responsible for the mishaps,'' Starr wrote in an opinion that was
joined by Judges Harry T. Edwards and Douglas H. Ginsburg.
   Starr noted that ``over 300 X-cars, including 71 that had been
the subject of consumer complaints, and 528 peer cars were run
through the testing gauntlet. Those impressive numbers stand in
rebuke to the government's claim that an insufficient sample was
used.''

   A federal judge temporarily froze Panamanian assets
in banks here after a suit was filed Tuesday to prevent the
government of strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega from
withdrawing any funds.
   A similar order was issued last week in New York City, and a
suit was filed Tuesday in Boston as well. A hearing in the Boston
suit was set for Friday.
   The Miami suit lists the Republic of Panama as the plaintiff and
was set in motion by Panama's U.S. Ambassador Juan B. Sosa, who has
refused to recognize the Noriega government.
   The money at issue is ``a substantial amount,'' said Sosa's
attorney, Mark A. Cohen. But he refused to give a figure.
   U.S. District Judge Sidney Arononvitz issued a temporary
restraining issue late Tuesday afternoon preventing the defendant
banks from turning over any funds to Noriega or his government's
agencies. The judge scheduled a hearing on the order for 1:30 p.m.
Wednesday.
   Defendants in the Miami suit were the Citizens and Southern
International Bank, Republic National Bank of Miami, Barnett Bank
of Florida and the Boston-based Bank of New England's international
branch in Miami.
   The suit says Noriega, under indictment for drug smuggling in
Miami and Tampa, illegally dismissed Panama's legal President Eric
Arturo Delvalle on Feb. 25.
   The suit states that Delvalle consitutes the ``only lawful
government of the Republic of Panama and that Gen. Noriega's regime
is illegal.''
   It said only Sosa is authorized to withdraw money from the bank
accounts, and seeks an injunction preventing the banks from making
payments without his approval.

   Security forces crushed an attempted
coup Tuesday on Sao Tome and Principe and killed two of the 40
armed raiders who landed in canoes in the Marxist-ruled West
African nation, a government official said.
   Information Ministry official Joao Carlos said most of the
attackers were captured as they tried to seize National Police
headquarters on the coast of the former Portuguese colony.
   One policeman was wounded and security forces were combing
coastal areas for attackers still on the loose, Portuguese radio
reported from Sao Tome.
   Carlos, speaking in a telephone interview with Portuguese
television, said forces loyal to the Marxist government of
President Manuel Pinto da Costa were securing key facilities,
including broadcasting stations and the airport.
   Sao Tome and Principe lies about 125 miles off the west coast of
Gabon in the Gulf of Guinea. The two-island country, with a
population of 110,000, has one political party, the Sao Tome e
Principe Liberation Movement.
   The Portuguese radio report said the raiders boarded canoes from
a larger craft that anchored offshore.
   President da Costa appealed Tuesday night for vigilance against
attacks in a two-minute broadcast on national radio after an
emergency Cabinet meeting, reports said. He said calm was restored
within hours of the landings on two beaches between 3 and 4 a.m.
   Da Costa blamed the attack on government foes linked to the
National Resistance Front of Sao Tome and Principe. Portuguese TV
said the raiders were suspected of launching the attack from Gabon,
where the Front is based.
   The Front's Lisbon-based secretary-general, Quintiliano Loures
Amadao, denied it was responsible.
   He said the attack may have been carried out by dissidents
within the Front, or members of the Sao Tome and Pricipe armed
forces unhappy over the presence there of Angolan troops.
   The two islands lie on strategic Atlantic shipping lanes. News
reports in 1984 said about 2,000 Soviet and Cuban troops ran two
radio stations and a submarine facility in the area.
   Rumors of an imminent invasion swept Sao Tome and Principe in
1978 and Cuba, Angola and Guinea-Bissau sent troops to help defend
the islands.
   The invasion never materialized, but the country has since
strengthened its ties with Angola, Cuba and the Soviet Union. An
estimated 1,000 Angolan troops are stationed in Sao Tome and
Principe to support the regular army.
   The force supposed to be behind the invasion never was clear.
   The ruling party has not previously faced armed opposition.
Loures Amadao said the Resistance Front supported peaceful dialogue
with the government because it was in no position to engage in an
armed struggle for power.

<HEAD>Shultz Urges Israeli Envoy to Convey to Shamir Urgency on Peace
Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George Shultz told a senior
Israeli envoy Tuesday that he would reject any attempt by Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir to postpone a response to his Mideast peace
plan, an Israeli source said.
   Shultz met for an hour with Israel's former ambassador to
Washington, Moshe Arens, a close Shamir confidante, said the
source, who spoke on condition he not be identified by name. The
State Department confirmed the meeting took place but declined to
comment further.
   Arens asked for the meeting following a letter sent last week by
30 senators to Shultz urging that Shamir cede Israeli-occupied
lands in return for peace with the Arabs.
   The letter by some of Israel's staunchest supporters on Capitol
Hill caused consternation in Jerusalem, which is unused to such
censure from Congress. Shamir is expected to face heavy pressure
from Congress when he comes here for a four-day visit next week.
   Shultz told Arens that ``he sees no good reason why Shamir
cannot come here with an answer'' to the U.S. proposal which calls
for negotiations on a three-year period of Palestinian self-rule to
be followed by talks on a permanent solution for the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip, said the source.
   Shamir on Sunday blocked a Cabinet debate on the proposal, which
Shultz presented during a shuttle diplomacy swing through the
region last week, but said he would bring the subject up for a
decision after he returns from Washington. Shultz asked both Israel
and Jordan for an answer within 10 days.
   Israeli news reports say Shamir will make Shultz a
counterproposal which will include self-rule for the 1.5 million
Palestinians under Israeli control but will not address the
question of the future of the territories.
   Shamir and his right-wing Likud bloc are opposed to a
land-for-peace formula.
   The White House on Monday welcomed the senators' call for Shamir
to give up Arab lands, but the State Department has not responded
publicly. Shultz is expected to answer the senators, possibly later
this week.
   Shultz told Arens that ``Israel can't afford to delay,''
especially in view of the growing congressional and public pressure
for negotiations to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian violence which
has resulted in the killing of some 80 Arabs by Israeli troops over
the past three months.
   Meanwhile, Sen. Chic Hecht of Nevada and several of his fellow
Republicans were working on a letter or statement in response to
last week's letter to Shultz. Hecht, as well as Sens. Jesse Helms
of North Carolina and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, are opposed to
what they view as internal interference in Israeli politics.

<TEXT>
   An organization formed to advise President
Reagan on Jewish matters lashed out Tuesday at 30 senators who
wrote a letter supporting the administration's position that it is
time for Israel to exchange land for peace.
   The group, known as the National Jewish Coalition, said the
senators ``operated in haste'' and were ``inserting themselves into
the internal politics of Israel.''
   The group issued its statement after a meeting in the Oval
Office with Reagan. However, Richard Fox, the chairman of the
organization, said the president did not discuss the peace process
or the violence in the Israeli-occupied territories.
   He said the meeting with Reagan lasted only 12 or 13 minutes and
the president's comments were ``really more of a ceremonial
statement. There was no forum for discussion of the issue.''
   The coalition, formed after the 1984 election, comprises Jewish
Republicans.
   On Monday, the White House had said it welcomed the senators'
statement, in which they criticized Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir and his Likud party, suggesting they may be blocking efforts
to reach a peace settlement in the Middle East.
   Asked about that letter, Fox said, ``Our belief is that those
distinguished senators _ all of whom are friends of Israel _
operated in haste.''
   He complained that they based their criticism on a report in The
New York Times ``rather than direct statements from the prime
minister.'' The letter had said the senators were dismayed to read
in the newspaper that Shamir had opposed giving up any territory,
saying, ``this expression of territory for peace is not accepted by
me.''
   Fox said the senators ``are dealing in an area which is very
sensitive at this time and essentially inserting themselves into
the internal politics of Israel.
   ``There is obviously a debate going on between the two political
parties in Israel as to what their position should be and I think
the best thing that we who are concerned and interested can do is
to hopefully let the Israelis develop their own position.''
   He also said the organization was supportive of the Middle East
peace approach taken by Secretary of State George P. Shultz, but
said much of details remain to be defined.

   Construction has begun at an abandoned
Strategic Air Command base near Ben Guerir, Morocco, to create an
emergency landing site for space shuttles when they begin flying
again, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said
Tuesday.
   The former SAC base has a 14,000 foot runway, but its surface
must be rejuvenated to make it usable by shuttles that for some
reason they fail to reach the speeds necessary to get into orbit.
   The Ben Guerir base, 40 miles north of Marrakech will be the
fourth emergency site. NASA announced earlier in the week that
another airport site in northwest Africa, in the tiny country of
The Gambia, will be upgraded to accommodate shuttles. The space
agency intends to continue using runways at Zaragoza Air Base and
Moron Air Base in Spain.
   Foundations for shuttle approach and landing aids are being laid
at the new sites and other equipment, including 10 personnel
vehicles, will be shipped.

   A cold air mass moving across the nation's midsection produced
rain and thunderstorms from Michigan to Texas on Tuesday, while
most of the East enjoyed springlike weather.
   Up to an inch of rain was reported across parts of northeast
Texas, northwestern Louisiana and southwestern Arkansas. Half-inch
hail fell at Killeen, Texas. Lake Charles, La., got three-quarters
of an inch of rain in an hour early Tuesday morning.
   High wind buffeted the high Plains and northern Rockies, with
gusts of 61 mph at Brookings, S.D., 53 mph at Mitchell, S.D., and
50 mph at Cheyenne, Wyo.
   Falling snow reduced visibility to a mile or less from northeast
Minnesota into eastern South Dakota.
   Up to four inches of snow was reported across southern and
eastern South Dakota. Huron, S.D., received an inch of new snow the
6 hours ending at 1 p.m. EST.
   Rainshowers were scattered across the Pacific Northwest.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 1 p.m. EST
included 1.38 inches at Lake Charles, La.; 0.97 inch at Jonesboro,
Ark.; 0.96 inch at Leesville, La.; 0.94 inch at Hot Springs, Ark.;
0.70 inch at Little Rock, Ark.; 0.61 inch at Killeen, Texas; 0.51
inch at Lafayette, La.; 0.45 inch at Alexandria, La.; and 0.41 inch
at Marquette, Mich.
   Springlike weather ruled much of the eastern third of the
nation. Skies were mostly sunny across the Ohio Valley and
middle-Atlantic region into New England.
   Temperatures at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 21 degrees at Yellowstone
Park, Wyo., to 89 degrees at McAllen, Texas. The morning low was 15
degrees below zero at Gunnison, Colo.
   Wednesday's forecast called for rain showers from central and
southern New England through the lower Great Lakes, the Ohio and
Tennessee valleys into the Atlantic Coast and in the northern
Plateau, western Washington and northwestern Oregon; showers and
thunderstorms across much of the South from the lower Mississippi
Valley into the southern Atlantic; rain and snow showers across
eastern upper Michigan, turning to snow late in the day; and gusty
winds across the northern Rockies.
   High temperatures were expected to reach the 30s across the
northern Great Lakes; the upper 20s and 30s across northern Maine;
the 40s from northern Washington into western Montana and from the
eastern Dakotas into southern New England; the 70s across southern
California and Arizona, the central Gulf Coast and the southern
Atlantic Coast; the low 80s across much of Florida and the desert
Southwest; and the 50s and 60s elsewhere.

   Attorneys for Lyndon LaRouche, six followers and
five LaRouche political groups battled the government Tuesday for
access to classified FBI information concerning LaRouche and key
players in the Iran-Contra scandal.
   Several of the defense lawyers sought to dismiss the case after
being denied immediate access to the information, but U.S. District
Judge Robert E. Keeton deferred ruling on the requests until after
questions over access to the FBI files are resolved.
   Defense attorneys, at hearings outside the presence of the jury,
have presented evidence in recent weeks of FBI infiltration of
LaRouche organizations.
   They also have gained access to a one-page memo from retired Air
Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord to Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North, the
former National Security Council aide, in which Secord reports
``our man here claims Lewis has collected info against LaRouche.''
Lewis was not further identified.
   The memo, found in North's safe after he was fired because of
his role in the Iran-Contra affair, was surrendered to LaRouche
defense lawyers after the special prosecutor investigating the
scandal acknowledged its existence.
   Secord, reached Tuesday in Washington, said he could not recall
the memo and said he never had crossed paths with LaRouche. Secord
was one of North's principal operatives in his network of private
aid to the Contras.
   Defense lawyers have said they will prove the Reagan
administration plotted to ruin LaRouche because he refused to
support Reagan's programs to aid Nicaragua's Contra rebels. They
also argue that the government has improperly withheld evidence
that could prove their case, which could be grounds for dismissal
of the charges.
   They contend that North directed the FBI to gather information
against LaRouche and infiltrate his organizations as part of a
larger FBI surveillance of groups opposed to the administration's
Central American policies.
   LaRouche, the aides and organizations all are charged with
conspiring to cover up alleged credit card fraud by LaRouche
supporters during his 1984 presidential campaign. Four of the
organizations are charged with fraud. LaRouche is seeking the 1988
Democratic presidential nomination, his fourth run for the White
House. He faces up to five years in prison if convicted.
   Prosecutors throughout the trial and pretrial hearings denied
defense contentions that the government inflitrated LaRouche's
organzations and concocted a credit card fraud and cover-up scheme
to destroy LaRouche and his following.
   After learning of the May 1986 Secord-North memo, defense lawyer
Michael Reilly requested any information the government had about
LaRouche and Lewis that might be favorable to defense claims.
   The prosecutor in the case, Assistant U.S. Attorney John
Markham, surrendered documents from FBI files to Reilly, but the
FBI later told Markham that he was not supposed to release the
material.
   Other defense attorneys now want copies of the documents, but
the FBI opposed the request on grounds the records are classified.
Reilly, who represents just one of the five LaRouche organizations
that are defendants, has said he cannot give the documents to his
fellow defense lawyers because of federal rules on classified
information.
   Markham, as the government attorney in the case, normally would
argue the FBI's position. But he refused to do so Tuesday, saying
there was a conflict of interest between the FBI's stance and his
role as prosecutor of the case. He did not elaborate, but said the
conflict would be resolved before the Wednesday hearing on access
to the records.
   Keeton also told Markham he wants an explanation as to why
defense lawyers, through Freedom of Information Act requests, have
learned of the existence of thousands of other FBI documents
mentioning LaRouche that were not turned over to defense lawyers
before the trial.
   ``I've got to have some explanation from the government about
how the documents are discoverable through FOIA requests and not by
the prosecution,'' the judge said.
   After the questions over access to the records are resolved,
defense lawyers have said they will renew their motions for
dismissal of the case or a mistrial on grounds their opening
statements and cross-examination strategies would have been
different if they had reviewed the documents prior to trial.

   The governing Christian
Democratic Party on Tuesday withdrew the candidacy for the national
legislature of a member under investigation for alleged misuse of
U.S. aid funds.
   Rodolfo Castillo Claramount, vice president of the party,
appeared before the Central Elections Council to remove Luis Mejia
Miranda as a candidate for the National Assembly in elections March
20.
   ``Mejia is going to have support in order to clear up his
personal situation, but we don't want the application of justice to
be blurred if he is elected and possesses (legislative) immunity,''
Castillo told reporters.
   Assembly members have a degree of immunity from prosecution
under Salvadoran law.
   Castillo called on the public prosecutor's office to conduct a
thorough investigation of the allegations against Mejia, which were
reported Sunday by The New York Times.
   The newspaper said Mejia is being investigated for allegedly
misusing up to $2 million of U.S. aid.
   It quoted unidentified Salvadoran and U.S. officials as saying
it could be the largest case of theft of American aid money during
the administration of President Jose Napoleon Duarte, who was
elected for a five-year term in May 1984.
   Mejia on Monday denied the allegations and said, ``Can you
imagine that if I had ($2 million) I would still be in this
country?''
   The New York Times also said Duarte's son Alejandro, who is
running for mayor of San Salvador, was trying to protect Mejia.
   Alejandro Duarte on Monday denied having ties to Mejia.
   According to The New York Times, the money allegedly stolen was
part of a $10 million program to assist war-ravaged areas and help
win the support of Salvadorans in the war against leftist rebels.
   It said Mejia resigned three months ago as director of the
National Commission for the Restoration of Areas, but President
Duarte agreed to allow him to become a party candidate for the
National Assembly on the recommendation of Alejandro Duarte.

   Britain's Foreign Office summoned Panama's
ambassador Tuesday after he hired a British security firm to seize
the Panamanian consulate from diplomats opposed to Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   The assault, in which seven men from the security firm used a
Land Rover to smash through the glass doors of the consulate Monday
night, was condemned by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   ``Differences of opinion should not be fought out on London
streets,'' she told Parliament.
   The Foreign Office said Undersecretary Tim Eggar and Panamanian
Ambassador Guillermo Vega ``had a full discussion of the incident
and the background to it.'' It said Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey
Howe ``is now considering what the ambassador said.'' It did not
elaborate.
   Police announced Tuesday night that the seven security men, all
Britons, had been charged with offenses against public order.
   Consul Eduardo Arango and his staff had remained loyal to
deposed Panamanian President Eric Delvalle, who was ousted Feb. 26
after he tried to fire Noriega, the military chief and power behind
Panama's government.
   Arango, who was not in the consulate at the time of the
takeover, had been fired by Panama's new government but refused to
leave his post, saying Delvalle was the legitimate president.
   It was ``a thuggish way of behaving and an unbelievable way of
doing things in a civilized country,'' Arango told a British
Broadcasting Corp. television interviewer.
   Vega, loyal to Noriega, told reporters that the assailants had
his authority and were ordered into the consulate ``because this
place was full of outsiders to the Panama government.''
   Police said seven men forced their way into the consulate and
that six remained to occupy the offices. They said no one was
injured.
   The seven security employees were questioned by police and after
being charged they were released on an undisclosed amount of bail
for an April 6 court hearing.
   Police identified them as Michael Lord, 35, a security officer;
James Brown, 30, a company executive; Robert Green, 34, a security
consultant; electricians Thomas Anderson, 34, Joseph Anderson, 39,
and Kenneth Ford, 38, and construction worker Kevin Noble, 26. They
worked for GB Security.
   Noriega was indicted in Florida last month on drug trafficking
charges and the Reagan administration is pressing for his
resignation.

   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. and Vice
President George Bush cashed in on endorsements from Kentucky
politicians to easily win the state's Democratic and Republican
primaries Tuesday.
   Gore, running in his neighboring state, defeated Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis in the Democratic race by 45,593 votes or 39
percent to Dukakis' 26,902 votes or 23 percent, with 1,151 of 3,243
precincts or 35 percent reporting.
   Jesse Jackson was third with 20,509 votes or 18 percent;
Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt had 10,628 votes or 9 percent;
former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart had 4,363 votes or 4 percent; and
Illinois Sen. Paul Simon finished with 2,734 votes or 2 percent.
   In the Republican primary, with 1,384 of 3,237 precincts or 43
percent reporting, Bush soundly defeated Kansas Sen. Bob Dole by
36,887 votes or 58 percent to Dole's 14,731 votes or 23 percent.
   Former television evangelist Pat Robertson was next with 7,287
votes or 11 percent; New York Rep. Jack Kemp had 2,278 votes or 4
percent; and former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont finished with 339
votes or 1 percent.
   At stake were 55 Democratic and 38 GOP delegates.
   Gore won a battle with Dukakis for the support of Gov. Wallace
Wilkinson, who decided to go with a neighboring son of the South.
   ``He's one of us,'' Wilkinson said.
   But Dukakis wasn't giving up. He began running TV ads on Friday
and paid his first visit of the year to the state _ in Louisville
on Sunday _ wooing undecided voters.
   Bush had the support of Sen. Mitch McConnell, a national
campaign co-chairman, and the two GOP representatives who endorsed.
   In a late February poll conducted by the Louisville
Courier-Journal, Gore was the choice of 28 percent of Democrats
while Dukakis was the favorite of 20 percent. Hart was third with
10 percent while Gephardt, Jackson and Simon were all in single
digits. Undecided voters accounted for 23 percent.
   The poll found Bush preferred by 51 percent of likely GOP
voters. Dole was the choice of 28 percent. Undecided voters made up
the third largest segment at 11 percent. Robertson and Kemp split
the rest.

   The judge presiding over Gov. Evan
Mecham's impeachment trial told Mecham's lawyer Tuesday that he had
showed that the state's top lawman ``had a motive to testify
against the governor'' and ordered him to move on to other topics.
   Arizona Supreme Court Justice Frank X. Gordon, who earlier
fielded objections to questions focusing on the witness' sex life,
said he would allow no further testimony on the personal life or
motives of Department of Public Safety Director Ralph Milstead, a
key witness against Mecham on an obstruction of justice charge.
   ``You have made your point,'' Gordon told attorney Fred Craft as
he concluded a two-day cross-examination of Milstead.
   ``You have established that director Milstead had a motive for
testifying against the governor,'' said Gordon, ``that he had a
high-paying job with more than a modicum of influence and with a
number of perks.''
   He said it was clear that Mecham had planned to fire Milstead
and, ``presumably Col. Milstead wants to keep his job.''
   But he said further evidence on the subject would be cumulative
and time-consuming.
   He noted that the Senate impeachment court could overrule his
decision. But senators, who protested the slow pace of testimony
was costing taxpayers $20,000 a day, went along with Gordon.
   His ruling derailed an announced defense plan to call a parade
or witnesses to challenge Milstead's crediblity.
   ``This witness is the accuser of the governor ...,'' attorney
Jerris Leonard told the Senate shortly before Gordon's
announcement. ``What we are doing is asking questions to lay the
foundation for future witnesses to impeach his credibility.''
   Prosecutor Paul Eckstein told reporters outside the hearing room
that the judge's ruling will bar the defense from calling to the
stand a woman who the defense claims was Milstead's paramour.
   Craft's questioning drew repeated protests from the prosecutors
that he was using innuendo to delve into the sex life of Milstead.
The subject was ruled off-limits by Gordon earlier.
   The 63-year-old governor, who has not attended any sessions of
the impeachment trial since it began last week, is accused of
ordering Milstead not to help the attorney general investigate an
alleged death threat to a grand jury witness by a Mecham aide.
   The governor has acknowledged he may have given such
instructions to Milstead but says he was not fully informed about
the situation. And Milstead has said he cooperated with the
attorney general's office.
   Craft was interrupted several times by objections from House
prosector William French as Craft tried to delve into the
relationship between Milstead and a one-time DPS informant
Christina Juell Johnston.
   Milstead said they had a professional relationship, adding, ``I
counted her as a friend.''
   But he denied he escorted her on dates in his state vehicle or
paid for her meals out of state funds.
   Craft previously had asked, ``Did you ever travel to Mrs.
Christina Juell Johnston's home in your state vehicle?''
   ``I believe I did, yes,'' said Milstead.
   ``Did you ever stay overnight at Mrs. Christina Juell Johnston's
home with your state vehicle?'' asked Craft. ``No, I did not,''
said Milstead.
   As Craft continued to pose questions about the relationship,
asking if Milstead paid for her meals at restaurants, French arose
and addressed Gordon.
   ``Mr. Presiding Officer, this is cross-examination by innuendo.
It's improper,'' said French.
   Gordon noted that he had ruled out questions about Milstead's
alleged sexual affair as irrelevant. Milstead, who is now divorced,
was married at the time of the alleged affair, while Mrs. Johnston
was single.
   But Craft insisted he was merely seeking information about
possible misuse by Milstead of a state vehicle or possible improper
listing of meals on his expense account, and Gordon permitted the
questions to continue.
   In other questioning Tuesday, Craft suggested that Milstead
purposely kept Mecham in the dark about the investigation of the
alleged death threat.
   But Milstead insisted: ``The relevant information was in his
hands.'
   Milstead acknowledged he never told Mecham he was planning to
disobey the governor's orders and take the case to the attorney
general.
   ``I was in shock from his anger, ... his insistence we not
cooperate'' Milstead said. ``... He was not to be reasoned with.
   ``When his words were, `Don't give them any help whatsoever,' I
said, `OK' and that was the end of the conversation.''
   Asked whether Mecham might have assumed that Milstead was
agreeing to obey his order to keep quiet, Milstead said, ``He could
have construed it that way, yes.''
   In addition to obstructing the attorney general's investigation,
Mecham is accused in the impeachment trial of concealing a $350,000
campaign loan and misusing $80,000 in a state fund by loaning it to
his car dealership.
   Mecham, the first U.S. governor to face an impeachment trial in
six decades, also faces a criminal trial March 22 on felony charges
of concealing the campaign loan and a recall election May 17.

   Retired investment banker Arthur K.
Salomon admitted Tuesday that he shot a college student after a
traffic dispute, saying he was afraid the young man was going to
attack him.
   Salomon, 53, pleaded guilty to first-degree assault. He had been
indicted on a charge of attempted murder.
   In return for the plea, state Supreme Court Justice Nicholas
Colabella indicated he would sentence Salomon to two to six years
in prison on April 27. Salomon, grandson of one of the founders of
the Salomon Brothers investment firm, could have received a maximum
of five to 15 years in prison.
   Salomon read a brief statement describing what happened June 19
when he shot Gianluca Cotugno, 19, of Larchmont off the Hutchinson
River Parkway in Scarsdale, north of New York City.
   Cotugno, who was hospitalized several weeks with a gunshot wound
to the stomach, was not in court.
   Salomon said he was heading south on the parkway from his Pound
Ridge home to his Manhattan apartment when a white Honda began to
tailgate him. The driver flashed his lights and ``attempted to run
my car off the road,'' Salomon said.
   Salomon pulled off at an exit, and stopped his 1977
Mercedes-Benz. The Honda also pulled off, Salomon said, and the
driver got out of the car.
   ``A tall, slim white male was moving rapidly toward my car,
waving his arms in a threatening manner and shouting,'' Salomon
said. ``I believed at that time that this individual was going to
attack me.''
   The other man was unarmed, Salomon said.
   Salomon said he reached for a loaded .38-caliber Colt revolver
in the car.
   By then, the man was ``standing adjacent to the passenger door
of my car. He was leaning over my car, making threatening motions
with his hands. I believe he was going to attack me,'' Salomon
said. ``Knowing that the revolver was loaded, I discharged it in
the direction of the individual.''
   Salomon said that when he realized he had hit the man, ``I
panicked and drove away.''
   Salomon, who had licenses for the Colt and another gun,
surrendered to authorities several hours later.
   Cotugno told authorities that Salomon was traveling slowly in
the left lane and, despite his flashing his lights, Salomon would
not move to the right lane so that he could pass.
   Salomon pulled over, waving for Cotugno to do the same, Cotugno
said.
   Cotugno said that when he approached Salomon's car, he spotted
the gun and told Salomon he was going to get the car's license
plate and call police. The shooting occurred after Cotugno had
started to walk back to his car.
   A $15 million civil suit Cotungo filed against Salomon is
pending.

<HEAD>Director John Waters Calls Actor `Kind and Gentle Man'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Divine, the bizarre female impersonator who
starred in such films as ``Pink Flamingos'' and ``Hairspray,'' was
remembered Tuesday by John Waters, director of the two movies, as
``a kind and gentle man.''
   ``Divine is as irreplaceable to me as a member of my own
family,'' Waters said, reading haltingly from a statment at a
Baltimore hotel. ``I'll miss him incredibly.''
   ``Not only did I respect him as the best actor I've ever worked
with, I knew him personally as a kind and gentle man,'' Waters said.
   The 42-year-old actor, whose real name was Harris Glenn
Milstead, was found dead in his bed Monday at the Hollywood Regency
Plaza Hotel. Waters said he was told Divine was found under the
covers ``with a smile on his face.''
   A preliminary coroner's autopsy failed to pinpoint a cause of
death, and a microscopic examination of tissue samples was ordered.
Preliminary tests showed no signs of trauma or any other factor
that would have contributed to the actor's death, Los Angeles
County coroner's spokesman Steve Stewart said Tuesday.
   Publicist John West of PMK said the actor apparently died of
asphyxiation during the night. He was in town to appear in an
episode of ``Married ... With Children,'' a Fox Television Network
series.
   Divine normally slept upright, propped up because of his weight,
said Peter Haas, a publicist for ``Hairspray.''
   Divine had a long-term weight problem but was found at a medical
checkup Friday to be otherwise in excellent health, his manager,
Bernard Jay, said Tuesday.
   ``He was not on drugs at all, and he never drank alcohol,'' Jay
said. ``I suppose it all comes down to his weight. He was
constantly trying to diet, but as soon as he'd take the pounds off,
they'd come right back on again.''
   Waters was one of the actor's few friends in school in
Lutherville, a Baltimore suburb, where Milstead said he grew up fat
and taunted by classmates.
   Waters' obsession with trashy movies nearly matched Milstead's
fantasies of celebrity, and Waters began casting his friend in
bizarre roles.
   The most famous would be the cult film classics ``Pink
Flamingos,'' ``Lust in the Dust,'' ``Polyester'' and ``Female
Trouble.''
   He had been pleased over his role in ``Hairspray'' as Edna
Turnblad, the fat mother of a fat teen-age girl.
   ``He'd call me in the middle of the night to read me some
newspaper interview and say, `Isn't it wonderful! They called me
Divine, the 300-pound actor, not Divine, the 300-pound
transvestite,''' Jay said.
   As Divine, he wore garish makeup and was loud and foul-mouthed.
``She's her own person and a lot of people like that,'' he once
said. ``The camp element is something out of the ordinary, this big
man playing a sexy woman.''
   Milstead played a non-transvestite role, that of a Sydney
Greenstreet-type character, in the 1985 film ``Trouble In Mind.''
   Besides film roles, Milstead used the Divine persona in a
nightclub act.
   Waters said that the last time he had spoken to Divine was two
days ago and that he had last seen him at the premiere of
``Hairspray'' in New York City.
   In their last conversations, Waters said, ``he was just so
happy. He said `Can you believe we came this far?'''

   Arabs stabbed a man
accused of aiding Israel and dumped the corpse at his mother's
door, and Israeli gunfire killed another Palestinian on Tuesday,
hospitals and witnesses reported.
   Hundreds of Arab women held demonstrations in the occupied
territories, following a call for protests from the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   Hospital officials in Nablus said three Arab protesters were
wounded by Israeli gunfire, but the army said a Jewish settler shot
one of them after the settler's car was stoned in the Balata
refugee camp.
   Residents of Mazraa Sharqiya said a settler shot Khader Mohammed
Hamideh, a 42-year-old businessman with seven children, outside his
home. The army confirmed Hamideh's death but said it was
investigating the circumstances.
   According to U.N. figures, at least 83 Palestinians have been
killed by Israelis since Arab riots began Dec. 8 in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, which Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in the
1967 Middle East war.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir indicated Tuesday on Israel
Television that he intends to debate U.S. peace proposals and to
present his own plan when he visits Washington next week.
   The U.S. plan calls for talks on a three-year period of
Palestinian autonomy in the occupied territories to be followed in
December by negotiations on the permanent status of these
territories.
   Shamir said, ``This is only a proposal and we can certainly
present our own proposals and make our comments.''
   Asked if he expects pressure in Washington, the hardline prime
minister replied, ``I don't expect any pressures and if there would
be such they would not help.''
   Shamir opposes the U.S. plan because it calls for an
international role in talks and because of its accelerated
timetable.
   The daily Hadashot said that Shamir's plan calls for talks
between U.S. and Soviet representatives only. The superpowers would
have a symbolic role and talks on a permanent solution would start
three years after Palestinian autonomy is implemented.
   In another development Tuesday, the military command said four
army officers were sentenced to 35 days in jail each for not being
armed when three guerrillas commandeered their car before hijacking
a bus Monday.
   The officers were on their way to an army sporting event in
track suits and fled when the guerrillas opened fire, the army said.
   Three Israeli hostages and the guerrillas were killed during the
hijacking and later storming of the bus. The PLO claimed
responsibility..
   More than 5,000 mourners attended the funerals of the slain
Israelis Tuesday at Beersheba in southern Israel.
   In Jericho, residents of the Aqbat Jaber refugee camp said
Palestinians killed an Arab policeman suspected of collaborating,
wrapped the body in a Palestinian flag and dropped it at his
mother's door.
   The army confirmed the body of Nabil Juma Farah, 30, was found
in the refugee camp Monday night.
   It was the second killing of a suspected collaborator reported
since violence began.
   Police Minister Chaim Bar-Lev said he would encourage other Arab
policemen not to quit by raising their pay and trying to discover
who killed Farah.
   In Mazraa Sharqiya, 15 miles northeast of Jerusalem, villagers
said three Israelis believed to be settlers stopped at a roadblock
built of stones and trash bins and one shot Hamideh, who owned a
cafe and butcher shop.
   ``Two of them got out and started to remove the stones. ... One
of them got out and started to shoot,'' one witness said, speaking
anonymously fear of reprisals.
   He said the settler fired at a home about 150 yards away then
shot at Hamideh's home next door, where the victim was standing.
   Later Tuesday, about 600 villagers chanting slogans and waving a
PLO flag carried Hamideh's coffin through the village and buried
him.

<HEAD>Talks Fail on US Participation in Japanese Contruction Projects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Associated Press Writer=
   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A week of talks between U.S. and Japanese
officials over participation by U.S. firms in billions of dollars
worth of Japanese building projects ended in failure Tuesday.
   And, a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
President Reagan under the law could retaliate against Japan for
what are considered unfair trade practices.
   ``That is one of the options,'' the official said, adding that
the Reagan administration will decide probably by the end of next
week what its next step will be.
   The official said the U.S. side had exhausted its capacity to
resolve the issues and was not ready to go on talking, given the
differences between the two sides.
   He said the Japanese, who had offered measures to allow U.S.
construction firms to gain experience in Japan on seven projects,
wanted discussions to continue.
   The U.S. delegation was led by J. Michael Farren, deputy
undersecretary of Commerce for international trade. The Japanese
group was headed by Peter Sato, director general of economic
affairs in the Japanese Foreign Ministry.
   Farren has criticized previous Japanese proposals as offering
American companies only limited experience, not enough to enable
them to take part in normal Japanese bidding on public projects.
   The U.S. official, as an example, cited the extension of the
Tokyo International Airport at Haneda, where he said the only
opportunity offered to Americans would be in ``compacting earth and
laying concrete,'' and in building a monorail.
   The Americans would not be competitive in the labor-intensive
construction, he added. He said that under the Japanese proposals
they would not be allowed to participate in the design or
engineering, nor in the building of a $900 million airport terminal.
   The official said the U.S. delegation also wanted the
arrangements on participation by U.S. construction firms written
into a formal agreement, while the Japanese did not want to be
bound and sought only a joint statement that unspecified
arrangements were satisfactory.

   Police used tear gas and water cannons on
Tuesday to scatter hundreds of demonstrators who turned an
International Women's Day march into a protest against the military
government.
   At dusk, police reported around 100 demonstrators detained, but
reporters in Santiago and other witnesses called that figure too
low.
   Demonstrators were also arrested in similar protests in
Valparaiso, 75 miles northwest of Santiago on the Pacific coast.
   The street protests were the first this year against the
14-year-old regime of Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
   Helmeted riot police in downtown Santiago fought running battles
for hours with protesters, most of them women.
   Scattered repeatedly by police, the demonstrators would quickly
regroup at a different intersection and renew their chanting of
anti-government slogans.
   Police used water cannons to put out flaming barricades erected
by protesters.
   Reporters saw a public bus set afire with gasoline bombs thrown
by three people. The bus was destroyed, but all passengers fled
without injury.
   The United Nations declared March 8 as International Women's
Day, but Chile's government said leftist groups turned the day into
a ``Marxist event.''
   Tuesday's march was called by women's organizations and
dissident groups.

   Jesse Jackson muscled out Tennessee Sen.
Albert Gore Jr. to win Virginia's first presidential primary
Tuesday, while Vice President George Bush overwhelmed Kansas Sen.
Bob Dole.
   In the Democratic race, with 434 of 1,986 precincts or 22
percent reporting: Jackson had 35,123 votes or 46 percent; Gore had
18,797 votes or 25 percent; and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
had 14,743 votes or 19 percent.
   Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt had 2,981 votes or 4 percent;
former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart had 1,412 votes or 2 percent, and
Illinois Sen. Paul Simon had 1,121 votes or 1 percent.
   In the Republican race, with 432 of 1,986 precincts or 22
percent reporting: Bush had 26,737 votes or 52 percent; Dole had
12,009 votes or 23 percent; and Virginia native Pat Robertson had
8,908 votes or 17 percent, and New York Rep. Jack Kemp had 1,978
votes or 4 percent.
   The Democrats were awarding 75 of Virginia's 84 national
convention delegates. No Republican delegates were at stake after
the Virginia GOP's Central Committee decided against a binding vote.
   Virginia's 50 Republican National Convention delegates will be
chosen at district and state conventions based on the outcome of
local GOP mass meetings and caucuses being held over the next two
months, and Robertson's supporters are expected to dominate those
events.
   Two weeks ago, backers of the former television evangelist from
Virginia Beach overthrew long-time party activists in Newport News
by taking delegate seats to the district convention.

   An Austrian Foreign Ministry official said Tuesday
that President Kurt Waldheim has accepted an invitation to visit
Kuwait and that Austria would not bow to ``Zionist threats,'' a
news agency reported.
   The official Kuwait News Agency quoted ministry general
secretary Thomas Klestil as telling it that Waldheim received the
invitation from the emir, Sheik Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, ``with all
appreciation and welcome'' and would visit ``at the earliest
convenient time.''
   It would be Waldheim's second visit to an Arab country following
the world furor raised over his service in the German army during
World War II.
   KUNA quoted Klestil as saying that Austria ``will not succumb to
Zionist threats and pressures to remove President Kurt Waldheim
from his office.''
   Klestil is on a tour of Persian Gulf Arab nations following a
visit by Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, to Vienna,
Austria's capital.
   Kuwait and neighboring noncombatant states are pressing for
international efforts to convince Iran to end its war with Iraq,
now in its eighth year.
   Waldheim has visited Jordan, the Vatican and Pakistan since his
election.

considered objectionable.
   Earlier, police detained nine journalists during an
anti-apartheid demonstration by about 100 black women outside the

   Police arrived about 10 minutes after the peaceful protest

   World Television soundman Prince Msuthu said police punched him.
   Police spokesman Col. Frans Malherbe said the nine were were
taken to police headquarters but were released without charge.
   Malherbe said emergency rules that have been in effect for
nearly two years prohibit members of the media from being at the
scene of unrest.
   The protesters, members of the Federation of Transvaal Women,
called on mining companies to oppose new government restrictions on
anti-apartheid organizations. The women's federation is an
affiliate of the United Democratic Front, one of 18 organizations
covered by the ban issued Feb. 24.
   Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the
26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs and the 5
million whites control the economy and maintain separate services.
   The censorship ruling by the Rand Supreme Court could lead to
the closing of the weekly New Nation, a newspaper published for
black readers by the South African Catholic Bishops Conference.
   During the hearing, Home Affairs Minister Stoffel Botha said he
had been ready to shut down the New Nation in January. He said the
paper published material that he felt promoted outlawed
organizations, fanned revolt and incited hostility toward security
forces.
   Under a decree issued in August by President P.W. Botha, the
home affairs minister can install censors at newspapers or shut
down the publications.
   In its challenge, the New Nation said the decree was
unenforceable because editors could not anticipate what the
minister might consider objectionable.
   Gabu Tugwana, acting New Nation editor, said in a telephone
interview, ``The paper we are putting out for tomorrow could be the
one before the last issue.'' He said the publishers intended to
appeal the decision.
   New Nation editor Zwelakhe Sisulu has been in detention without
charge for more than a year.
   Under the emergency decrees, the home minister is not required
to give detailed reasons for his objections to published material.
   The head of the three-judge panel said in the ruling the
president was ``legally correct'' to give the minister such power.

<HEAD>Infant's Death Brings Memphis Fire Toll To Seven Small Children
This Year</HEAD>

   The death of a 3-month-old boy in a home
fire brought to seven the number of small children killed in
residential fires this year, authorities said.
   N.E. Wallace, an assistant city fire marshal, said the latest
victim, Christopher Bolden, died Monday in a fire apparently caused
by an electrical short circuit.
   The boy's 6-month-old cousin, Jessica Baker, suffered smoke
inhalation and was listed in critical condition Tuesday in Le
Bonheur Children's Medical Center.
   Wallace said three children from 1 to 3 years old died in
residential fires in Memphis last year. So far this year, seven
youngsters age 6 or less have died.
   When the latest fire broke out, Christopher was one of five
children being cared for at a house by one of his aunts. The woman
managed to escape from the house with three of the children, ages
21 months to 4 years, and firefighters saved Jessica.
   ``The family was out front screaming that there were kids
inside,'' said firefighter Ron Chastain. ``There was an awful lot
of smoke, and as soon as we got the door open, a lot of fire shot
out.''

<HEAD>Lobby: Robertson's Poor Showing Means Split In `Traditional Value
Community'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pat Robertson's poor showing in the Super
Tuesday voting in the South shows that ``the traditional value
community has been totally fractured,'' the chairman of Christian
Voice said Tuesday night.
   ``Frankly, I'm surprised that he did not do better,'' said
Robert Grant, who leads the largest conservative evangelical lobby
in the country.
   In early returns, Robertson did not come in better than third in
any state, behind Vice President George Bush and Sen. Bob Dole of
Kansas. He bested another conservative, Rep. Jack Kemp of New York,
however.
   Grant said the opinion-makers on the far right of the Republican
Party must now try to come to some consensus on who they will back.
   ``Only as this community hangs together does it have any real
impact,'' Grant said. ``The traditional value community has been
totally fractured with Kemp taking a piece, Robertson taking the
charismatics to a degree and a large part going to Dole and Bush.''
   He said the vice president's showing in the South ``is an
indication that he may be a viable candidate for the Bible
Belt-type vote, but he is going to have to work for it.''
   However, said Grant, ``The image or perception conveyed by the
Bush campaign has been to savage and to turn away conservative
Christian activities. This has not necessarily been the sentiment
of the vice president but it has been the impression conveyed
within his campaign and among many established Republican types.
   ``If Bush wishes to woo that vote, he has a good shot at it.''

   A teen-ager who admitted plotting the fatal
beating of a classmate in 1986 has not suffered from severe
psychosis or hallucinations despite a history of behavioral
problems, medical experts said Tuesday.
   The Norfolk Superior Court jury is expected to hear closing
arguments then begin deliberations Wednesday, the seventh day of
the trial.
   Rod Matthews, 15, of Canton is being tried as an adult for
murder in the Nov. 20, 1986, slaying of 14-year-old Shaun
Ouillette, also of Canton, who allegedly was lured to a wooded area
by Matthews and beaten with a baseball bat.
   Matthews, who pleaded innocent by reason of insanity, said he
had plotted the slaying for a month to experience what killing
someone was like, according to testimony from two classmates to
whom Matthews showed the body.
   Dr. Michael Annunziata, a court-appointed psychiatrist, told a
Norfolk Superior Court jury that Matthews suffered from a ``conduct
disorder'' but that he had not experienced classic symptoms of
psychosis, such as hallucinations.
   Matthews, said Annunziata, had ``substantial capacity to conform
his conduct to the requirement of law.''
   Annuziata on Tuesday said the methodical planning of the killing
did not indicate psychotic tendencies but suggested Matthews was
``playing by different rules.''
   Earlier, Dr. Marcel Kinsbourne, director of behavioral neurology
at the Eunice Shriver Center in Waltham, testified that standard
doses of Ritalin, a drug Matthews had been taking, should not
trigger violent behavior.
   Ritalin, a stimulant primarily used to control hyperactivity in
children, has been a key aspect of the case.
   The defense had contended that Matthews was a mentally ill youth
from a troubled home and that his problems were exacerbated by the
use of Ritalin.
   Dr. Bernard Yudowitz of Belmont's McLean Hospital said on Monday
that Ritalin may have made it harder for Matthews to control his
behavior.

   Vice President George Bush cruised to an
easy victory in Tuesday's presidential primary, while favorite son
Albert Gore Jr. blasted past other Democrats to win his home state.
   In the Republican race, with 195 of 2,391 precincts or 8 percent
reporting: Bush had 10,747 votes or 61 percent; Kansas Sen. Bob
Dole had 3,600 votes or 20 percent; former TV evangelist Pat
Robertson had 2,121 votes or 12 percent; and New York Rep. Jack
Kemp had 894 votes or 5 percent.
   In the Democratic race, with 202 of 2,391 precincts or 8 percent
reporting: Gore had 34,449 votes or 76 percent; Jesse Jackson had
7,345 votes or 16 percent; Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis had
1,537 votes or 3 percent; and Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt had
761 votes or 2 percent.
   Gephardt was an early campaigner in Tennessee, but since Gore
announced his candidacy in June, Jackson has been the only other
Democrat to visit the state.
   Gov. Ned McWherter, Gore's Southern campaign chairman, conceded
that Jackson was supported by most blacks, who constitute about 18
percent of the state's voters.
   Dole and Robertson targeted Bush as the man to beat in
Tennessee. Robertson was in the state three times since Jan. 1 and
has been represented by his wife twice. Dole, who visited the state
six times since last year, spoke in Knoxville on March 1.
   Robertson and Bush visited upper East Tennessee, Republican
territory, in the 10 days before the election. Kemp was in
Knoxville on Sunday, where he said he would reassess his future in
the race after Tuesday.

   Gov. Michael Dukakis and Vice President George
Bush romped to Super Tuesday victories in their home state of
Massachusetts, a delegate-rich field that was virtually abandoned
as the candidates rushed south.
   In the Democratic race, with 50 of 2,140 precincts or 2 percent
reporting, Dukakis had 6,594 votes or 60 percent; Jesse Jackson had
2,567 votes or 23 percent; Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt had 776
votes or 7 percent; Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. had 332 votes or
3 percent; Illinois Sen. Paul Simon had 277 votes or 3 percent.
   On the Republican side, with 49 of 2,140 precincts or 2 percent
reporting, Bush had 1,690 votes or 57 percent; Kansas Sen. Bob Dole
had 789 votes or 27 percent; New York Rep. Jack Kemp had 200 votes
or 7 percent; and Pat Robertson had 148 votes or 5 percent.
   Dukakis, the popular three-term governor of this liberal state,
was a prohibitive favorite in the Democratic primary, where 98
delegates were at stake, the party's third-biggest prize of the day.
   In the Republican primary, 52 delegates were at stake, the
fourth-biggest batch on Super Tuesday.

   Bush carried Massachusetts in the 1980 GOP primary _ over Ronald
Reagan _ and enjoys the support of many mainstream Republicans.
Bush, who held a rally at historic Faneuil Hall last week, is the
only Republican candidate to visit the state since the New
Hampshire primary, although Dole has sent his wife, Elizabeth, for
two campaign stops.
   In recent days, the Bush and Dole camps dueled with
endorsements. Bush was backed by former U.S. Attorney General
Elliot Richardson, Dole by former Sen. Edward Brooke.

   Police swinging clubs dispersed hundreds
of Warsaw University students who marched for more academic freedom
on Tuesday, the anniversary of 1968 student protests.
   In the southern city of Krakow earlier Tuesday, riot police
clashed repeatedly with student demonstrators and briefly detained
70-100 people, an opposition spokesman said.
   Twenty years ago, March 8, 1968, police and Communist Party
activists brutally attacked Warsaw University students who were
protesting censorship and political repression.
   This year's protests reflected a renewed campaign by student
activists for legalization of the Independent Students Union, or
NZS. It was outlawed after the independent labor federation
Solidarity was suppressed with the declaratrion of martial law in
December 1981.
   About 500 students chanting ``Register NZS!'' and
``Solidarity!'' and carrying banners began marching after an
evening Mass attended by about 2,000 people at St. Anne's, a Roman
Catholic church near Warsaw University.
   Riot police blocked the street 100 yards from the church,
keeping demonstrators away from a monument to Adam Mickiewicz, the
19th century Polish national poet.
   An NZS leader asked police to allow people to lay flowers at the
monument. After demonstrators refused an offer to let a
three-person delegation approach the monument, police charged the
crowd, flailing with clubs. Students fled.
   Hundreds of people lining the sidewalk chanted ``Gestapo!
Gestapo!'' Police pushed several students and at least one
middle-aged woman into vans, but how many people were detained
could not be determined.
   At Krakow's Jagiellonian University, about 700 students tried to
march to the main square in the city's Old Town and were blocked by
riot police, said Zygmunt Lenyk, a Krakow opposition activist.
   Quoting accounts from witnesses, he said police attacked the
crowd with clubs but about 50 demonstrators pushed through police
lines to the square, where they were detained.
   Lenyk said most of the students returned to campus and tried
twice more to march to the square, about 500 yards away, but police
attacked each time.
   Students erected a street barricade with park benches and
garbage cans but police vehicles drove through it, he reported.
   About 70 to 100 people were detained but police began releasing
them by early afternoon, he said. Lenyk reported at least three
people severely beaten by police.
   In 1968, police and party activists went onto the Warsaw
University campus to beat and arrest protesters, many of whom were
expelled, and a purge of reform-oriented intellectuals and Jews
followed. Last week, the Communist Party said the purge was
excessive.

<TEXT>
   King Hussein has invited Yasser Arafat,
chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, to Amman to
discuss the latest U.S. proposals on Middle East peace, a
government official said Tuesday.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
invitation ``comes within a framework of a United Arab stand''
reached at the Arab summit in Amman last year.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz explained the proposals on
trips to the region before and after last week's NATO summit in
Brussels.
   In Tunis, the Central Committee of Arafat's Fatah guerrilla
group said Tuesday the Shultz plan was ``nothing but a desperate
attempt aimed at reviving the (1982) Reagan initiative and imposing
it on the region.''
   CBS News, in a report from Paris, said, ``CBS News has learned
that the American ambassador to the United Nations, Vernon Walters,
met secretly with a top-ranking PLO leader in Tunisia last weekend.
This according to senior PLO officials who say the meeting took
place at a private home at a seaside resort near Tunis.''
   ``PLO sources say it probably had to do with how Palestinians
can participate in any future peace talks,'' the report said, and
added Walters denied he had met with the PLO. ``In a statement read
by a spokesman, Walters said he had no authorization to meet with
them and had not done so,'' CBS News said.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said
reports that Walters met with PLO representatives were ``absolutely
untrue.''
   The U.S proposals include limited self-rule for the 1.5 million
Palestinians living in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip and an international peace conference that could include the
five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, Israel,
Jordan, Syria and Palestinians, but not the PLO.
   Hussein and Arafat decided in 1985 to take a joint approach to
peace with Israel, but Hussein called it off in February 1986,
accusing Arafat of not keeping his promises.
   On Monday, Jordan's minister of information welcomed the U.S.
peace effort and said the Shultz proposals were being ``studied
thouroughly with Arab states.''
   ``We welcome the American moves, and we believe that the
American re-engagement in the peace process is positive,'' Hani
Khasawneh told reporters.

<TEXT>
   A class action suit filed on behalf of five
illegal aliens Tuesday challenges provisions of the government's
amnesty program that would bar hundreds of aliens from obtaining
legal residency.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court, seeks to block U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service rules concerning aliens who
do not meet some of the requirements for legalization but whose
illegal status was ``known to the government.''
   INS rules under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986
provide amnesty to aliens who lived illegally in the United States
before Jan. 1, 1982 as well as to agricultural workers who can
prove they lived in this country for at least 90 days in the year
ended May 1, 1986.
   A problem has arisen over individuals who arrived legally _ with
a visa _ but who remained in the country illegally after the Jan.
1, 1982 cutoff date, according to Debbi Sanders of the Washington
Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights, one of the attorneys for the
plantiffs.
   In cases like these, the statute grants amnesty to those whose
illegal status was ``known to the government.''
   Volunteer agencies helping illegal aliens have sought to use
Social Security and Internal Revenue Service forms to prove that
aliens in this category were known.
   The INS, however, maintained that ``known to the government''
meant known to the INS, Sanders said, noting that this difference
of interpretation disqualified hundreds of illegals.
   Intrepretation of those four words is the basis for the suit
filed by the lawyers' committee, the New York American Civil
Liberties Union, the Hispanic National Bar Association and a
Washington law firm.
   It if filed on behalf of five unidentified aliens and four
volunteer agencies: Ayunda Inc., the Ethopian Community Center, the
Latin American Youth Center and the Mexican American Legal Defense
and Educational Fund.
   ``I think the government has taken too narrow of view of what
the statute calls for,'' said Doris Meissener, acting immigration
commissioner 1981-82. ``It is quite clear that the government is
much more than INS.''
   INS Spokesman Duke Austin said, ``basically `known to the
government,' means known to us ... and known that there was an
illegal status.''

<HEAD>Troops Take Over Petroleum Plants in Response to Crippling Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER McFARREN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Troops took over plants of the state
petroleum company Tuesday and arrested labor leaders in response to
a strike that threatens to paralyze transportation and the
industrial sector.
   The government began rationing gasoline and motorists waited
hours in line. Many buses and taxis in major cities stayed off the
streets for lack of gasoline, tranport unions said.
   Police in Santa Cruz and La Paz rounded up leaders of the
Petroleum Workers Union. The government declared the strike illegal
and said there would be more arrests if the walkout continues.
   The conservative government decided to take over petroleum
plants and gasoline distributorships after the petroleum workers
union rejected a 30 percent wage increase conditioned on their not
striking for a year.
   The Santa Cruz refinery, 350 miles east of La Paz, was
surrounded by army units after workers turned off the plant's
machinery following the breakdown of negotiations with the
government.
   The plant produces 70 percent of the gasoline and natural gas
used domestically. It also is responsible for much of the natural
gas exported to Argentina, the country's principal source of export
earnings.
   Saul Soliz, leader of the Petroleum Workers Union, said the
government's linking of a wage increase to a promise of no strikes
is ``a maneuver to divide the labor movement against the interests
of workers.''
   The union accused the government of planning to finance the 30
percent wage increase with the firing of 1,500 workers. Minister of
Energy Fernando Illanes denied the charge. The government-owned
petroleum company employs 7,000 workers.
   The Ministry of Information said the military intervened to
prevent the destruction of equipment and guarantee a supply of fuel.
   Many factories in La Paz and other cities said they had enough
fuel for only two more days and were cutting back on production.
   ``The government will not negotiate under pressure, more so
since 11 out of 21 unions agreed to the wage increase,'' said
Illanes.

   Vice President George Bush marched across the South on Tuesday,
overwhelming Sen. Bob Dole as he headed for a near-sweep in Super
Tuesday voting. Dole braced to absorb the shock and the campaigns
of the two remaining Republican presidential contenders were dealt
shattering blows.
   Tuesday's voting seemed likely to bury the struggling campaigns
of Rep. Jack Kemp and Pat Robertson, who had claimed the South as
his base of support.
   Bush won decisive victories throughout the region, capturing
more than 50 percent of the vote in many states, including
delegate-rich Florida.
   He also scored big wins in Tennessee, Kentucky, Georgia,
Alabama, Virginia, Mississippi, North Carolina and Massachusetts.
   Dole had pinned his Southern hopes on North Carolina, the home
state of his wife, Elizabeth..
   ABC and NBC also projected the vice president as winning Texas
and Maryland.
   Dole had hoped to pull out a win in North Carolina, the home
state of his wife, Elizabeth.
   However, early returns showed the Senate minority leader to be
ahead in only one state _ Missouri, which borders his home state of
Kansas.
   At stake Tuesday were 712 delegates to the Republican National
Convention. Virginia was alone among the 17 GOP contests holding a
``beauty contest'' that awards no delegates.
   Bush's national campaign chairman, Lee Atwater, predicted that
Bush would pick up more than 600 of those delegates _ a gain that
would give him a near-unassailable lead toward winning the GOP
presidential nomination.
   ``I would certainly hate to be in Sen. Dole's shoes after
tonight and especially if he loses in Illinois,'' Atwater said.
Battered in Tuesday's voting, Dole turned his sights to next week's
Illinois primary in hopes of staging a comeback in Midwestern and
Western states.
   Dole said earlier in Springfield, Ill., ``If we take a little
bath today, I am going to start my road to recovery in Illinois
just like I did 40 years ago.''
   Dole was referring to his recovery in an Illinois hospital from
wounds suffered during World War II.
   Kemp and Robertson were far outdistanced by Bush and Dole. Kemp
trailed Robertson in most Southern states, and was expected to drop
out by week's end. For Robertson, the voting throughout the South
was a replay of his third place finish in Saturday's South Carolina
primary, when he could muster no more than about 20 percent of the
vote.
   Robertson seemed less likely to abandon his dogged pursuit of
the presidency at this time. But the former television evangelist
conceded in advance that ``it would take some miracle'' for him to
beat Bush.
   Bush voted in Houston, and then told reporters, ``If we exceed
our expectations or live up to them, I think we'll be in good
shape.''
   Top campaign aides had said earlier that they thought Bush stood
a good chance of winning at least 12 or 13 states.
   Polls showed the vice president ahead in 16 of the 17 contests,
including those in delegate-rich Texas and Florida. His chief
rival, Dole, was ahead only in Missouri.
   ``It's going to be a little tougher as we go along, but I've
been in tough fights before,'' Dole acknowledged at a morning news
conference in Kansas City, Mo.
   He then traveled to Illinois and immediately challenged Bush to
a series of debates _ ``one-on-one, without moderator'' _ in that
state, which holds its primary next Tuesday.
   Bush's chief spokesman, Pete Teeley, scoffed at the idea when
asked about it in Texas.
   ``If Bob Dole was so serious about debating, he would have shown
up for the (Feb. 19) Dallas Morning News debate,'' Teeley said.
``We have a strategy which has been highly successful and we plan
to pursue it, and that doesn't include having one-on-one debates
with Bob Dole.''
   Dole campaign strategists had conceded in advance that Super
Tuesday would likely belong to the vice president.
   In fact, the question appeared to be not whether Bush would
emerge the victor, but by what kind of margin _ and whether the
drubbing would be fatal to Dole, who finished first in the Iowa
caucuses but lost strength in the ensuing contests.
   The Dole campaign had sought to keep Bush from picking up more
than 500 delegates Tuesday.
   Dole, though, was looking ahead to Illinois, where he promised
to ``issue a challenge or two'' to Bush.
   The Senate majority leader, a 1984 presidential contender and
GOP vice presidential candidate in 1976, was reportedly spending
$500,000 on television advertising in the state.
   A defeat there could all but end Dole's presidential efforts and
a strong showing for the Kanasan was by no means assured. Bush is
backed by Illinois Gov. James Thompson and 93 of the state's 102
Republican county chairmen.
   Kemp, dead last in the South Carolina primary last weekend, had
not been expected to see that flagging effort revived in Tuesday's
voting. Aides said the New York lawmaker and former pro-football
star would reassess his race later in the week. He was expected to
pull out.
   Robertson's chances as a serious contender seemed likely to be
all but ended if his losses in Super Tuesday states were as
decisive as his third-place finish in South Carolina, where he won
only 19 percent of the vote.
   Robertson's candidacy came to life with his strong second-place
finish the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 8. But in the primaries that
followed, his strength ebbed.
   Even so, he told a North Carolinia campaign audience as recently
as Monday: ``We will do very well in the South.''

   Super Tuesday belonged to George Bush, an
avalanche of Southern votes propelling him into an all but
insurmountable lead in the race for the Republican presidential
nomination.
   One month to the day that the vice president was humiliated in
the Iowa precinct caucuses, his candidacy devastated by a
third-place finish behind Bob Dole and Pat Robertson, Bush was in
command of the GOP race.
   His campaign manager, Lee Atwater, predicted Bush would pick up
about 600 of the 712 GOP delegates at stake on Super Tuesday.
   What happened?
   On Feb. 9, few could resist writing Bush political obituaries.
Dole flew to New Hampshire with a claim to momentum that seemed
likely to carry him to a second straight victory.
   ``I think the vice president's campaign is over,'' said Pete du
Pont.
   ``The hemorrhaging of George Bush has begun,'' said Al Haig.
   Those assessments proved premature.
   It was du Pont whose campaign was soon over; Haig who didn't
even make it to New Hampshire primary day.
   Attempts to explain how the race turned around so quickly are
likely to center on whether Bush recovered or Dole blew it.
   For five days, Dole looked like a winner in New Hampshire. Then
came the ``straddle'' ads, Bush campaign commercials that portrayed
the Kansas senator as waffling on taxes, the single most sensitive
political issue in New Hampshire.
   The ads ran all weekend before the primary and there was no
response from the Dole campaign.
   Too late, Dole realized what had happened. His surge in the
polls leveled out. Suddenly, as voters began making up their minds
just before the primary, Bush began to gain.
   When the returns came in the vice president had won by 9 points
and an angry Dole appeared on television and snapped that Bush
should ``stop lying about my record.''
   But there was more to Bush's comeback than effective commercials.
   The vice president also changed his campaign style. He eschewed
the cautious speeches _ the attempts to be vice presidential _ that
had marked his Iowa campaign. He drove a fork-lift at a lumber yard
and an 18-wheeler at a truck stop.
   ``This is the real me,'' he proclaimed to more than a few
snickers.
   Whoever it was, he went over better with New Hampshire voters
than he had with their Iowa counterparts.
   But, possibly the most important factor in the Bush comeback was
Ronald Reagan, the man Bush had served as a totally loyal vice
president for seven years.
   In Iowa, identification with Reagan, the president blamed for a
devastated farm economy, was not an asset. Voters wanted to send a
message to the White House and they chose Dole as their messenger.
   But in New Hampshire, with an economy that had boomed since
Reagan took office, the president was enormously popular. The same
was true in the South.
   The calender had shifted to Bush's advantage.
   Might it now shift back to give Dole a boost? The next big
contest is the Illinois primary, a Midwest state, the region where
the Kansas senator has trounced Bush in three contests _ Iowa,
South Dakota and Minnesota.
   While campaigning Tuesday in Springfield, Ill., Dole said, ``If
we take a little bath today, I am going to start my road to
recovery in Illinois just like I did 40 years ago.'' It was a
Chicago physician who guided Dole's recovery from World War II
wounds.

   Two survivors of the Nov. 15 Continental
Airlines crash at Denver's airport told investigators Tuesday that
they thought they saw ice and snow on the wings as the DC-9 took
off in a swirling snowstorm, but a pilot on another plane said the
Continental jet looked clear.
   Moments after takeoff, the jet flipped over, hit the runway and
broke into three pieces, killing 28 people and injuring the other
54 people aboard. Some victims were trapped in the wreckage for
more than six hours.
   Wes Zimmerman, a Continental pilot on a neighboring plane that
day, and crash survivors Dr. Fred Helpenstell, 56, of Nampa, Idaho,
and Gregory Wadsworth, 22, an airman stationed in Idaho, were among
29 witnesses scheduled to testify at the National Transportation
Safety Board hearing, which opened Tuesday.
   De-icing and the pilots' experience flying DC-9s were the chief
issues raised during early testimony, although government officials
have said their inquiry is not focusing on a single possible cause.
   Zimmerman, whose Continental 727-300 aircraft was on the 35-L
runway at the same time as the Continental jetliner, said he saw no
ice or snow buildup on Flight 1713.
   ``I felt good about how my de-icing was holding up,'' he said,
explaining that he looked at nearby aircraft to gauge the condition
of his own plane. But he acknowledged that his plane did not sit
for as long between de-icing and takeoff as the ill-fated plane had
sat.
   Robert Benzon, the NTSB investigator in charge of the inquiry,
said during his opening statement that officials want to know why
24 minutes elapsed between the time Flight 1713 was de-iced and the
time it took off. Other planes on the runway were taking off 15
minutes after being de-iced, he said.
   ``The reasons for Flight 1713's 24-minute delay and the possible
effects of snow or ice buildup on the wings and tail surfaces of
the airplane during this delay are items of interest during this
hearing,'' Benzon said.
   In addition, the pairing of the two flight officers aboard
Flight 1713 would be discussed during the hearing, he said.
   Capt. Frank Zvonek, 43, who had 198 hours on a DC-9 with only
the previous 33 hours as captain; First Officer Lee Bruecher, 26,
had 36 hours piloting DC-9s and was flying the plane at the time of
the crash. Both men were killed.
   ``The pairing of two pilots with such experience in an aircraft
type will be discussed during this hearing,'' Benzon said.
   Helpenstell, who suffered broken ribs and a broken finger in the
crash, told the board that during takeoff from Stapleton
International Airport he noticed that a wing looked wet.
   ``I wondered at one point, `Is that ice?''' Helpenstell
recalled, ``but I decided it was just wet.''
   Wadsworth, who is stationed at Mountain Home Air Force Base in
Idaho, said he had a clear view of the left wing.
   ``It had started to snow a lot harder, and it made me real
nervous. It was like the snow was starting to pile up (on the
wings),'' he said. ``I was very concerned, but I said it under my
breath. I figured they do it (taking off in snowstorms) every day,
and I was hopeful they would be able to do it this time. But
unfortunately, that was not what happened. It was bad place.''
   Continental officials criticized Wadsworth's testimony during
the hearing, noting that he had lost a certification as an Air
Force mechanic. Wadsworth said he had been temporarily removed from
mechanic duty because he had suffered flashbacks of the accident
while he was on duty. He now works in a tool room.
   Zimmerman, who had flown a DC-9 from June 1985 to February 1987,
testified that before shortly before the Stapleton crash, light to
moderate snow was falling, not enough to affect safety.
   He said snow accumulation on his aircraft was ``very light. It
was a cold snow, not a wet snow. It didn't build up on the flat
surface of the wing.''
   He testified that Continental does not require pilots to have
planes de-iced, but leaves it to the pilots' discretion. He
estimated the time between the de-icing of his plane and takeoff at
17 to 18 minutes.
   Under questioning by federal investigators, Zimmerman said that
if he had had to wait five minutes longer for takeoff, he would
have re-evaluated whether his plane needed de-icing.
   Flight attendant Kelly Englehart, 35, testified she was
concerned when she learned that Bruecher would be flying the plane.
She and Helpenstell also gave conflicting versions of the direction
in which the aircraft rocked before it crashed.
   Helpenstell said the plane rocked first to the right side on
which he was seated and then came back suddenly to the left.
Englehart said the DC-9 rocked first to the left side and then
sharply to the right.
   ``We felt the wing must have hit then. There were three large
pops and a large explosion. I saw a large, orange fireball at the
front of the cabin moving down. I shut my eyes and waited for it to
be over. I waited for it to get me,'' she said.

   Spanish police found an explosives-laden car
Tuesday that was believed rented by three IRA members shot dead in
Gibraltar by British commandos, officials said.
   It was packed with powerful explosives made in Czechoslovakia
and rigged with a timing device set at 11:20 a.m., but the timer
had not been connected, the Spanish officials said. The white Ford
Fiesta was in a parking lot at Marbella, about 50 miles up the
coast from this British colony.
   British officials in London said the Irish Republican Army
members, who were unarmed when commandos killed them Sunday, had
planned to detonate a car bomb Tuesday during the 20-minute
changing of the guard ceremony at the governor's residence. The
ceremony began at 11 a.m.
   The Royal Anglian Regiment now guards The Convent, as the
residence is called. The regiment was just transferred from
Northern Ireland, where guerrillas of the mainly Roman Catholic IRA
have been fighting since 1969 to oust the British and unite the
province with the predominantly Catholic Irish Republic.
Protestants outnumber Catholics about 3-2 in the province.
   Soldiers patrolled Convent Square on Tuesday and the ceremony
went on as scheduled.
   All three of the IRA members were from west Belfast in Northern
Ireland.
   In Catholic west Belfast, protesters outraged at the killings
battled police and British troops throughout the day Tuesday. At
least two people were injured.
   Police in Northern Ireland also reported a 1,600-pound explosive
device was found in a hedge near the Killeen customs post between
Newry and the town of Dundalk in the Irish Republic and was defused.
   Bands of youths in west Belfast hurled gasoline bombs and rocks
at security forces, hijacked vehicles and burned them, set fire to
a lumber yard and erected barricades.
   They scattered as police and soldiers fired plastic bullets, but
quicly reorganized.
   Belfast police said a man's face was burned when his car was set
afire and a woman was treated at a hospital for injuries suffered
when her car was stoned.
   Prime Minister Charles Haughey of the Irish Republic held a
special Cabinet meeting. He told Parliament later his government
recognized Britain's right to take reasonable measures against
terrorism, but added:
   ``We are greatly perturbed at the shooting dead of three unarmed
Irish people in circumstances where it appears from reports that
they could have been arrested by the security forces. The law
shouldn't operate like that.''
   Witnesses to the shootings said men in civilian clothes,
believed to be members of the Special Air Services anti-terrorist
force, jumped from a car and opened fire on two men and a women
walking down the avenue leading to the border between Gibraltar and
Spain.
   Two cars connected with the dead IRA members were found in
Gibraltar. Sir Geoffrey Howe, the British foreign secretary, said
Monday a third car was believed to be involved.
   He said it was not true, as earlier official reports had said,
that a car the IRA members parked near the governor's residence
Sunday was packed with explosives.
   Howe said a ``dreadful terrorist act'' was averted when the
commandos killed the IRA members.
   Agustin Valladolid, spokesman for Spanish State Security in
Madrid, said the white Ford was found in the Sun Parking Lot in
Marbella at about 6:30 p.m. Tuesday.
   He said it was left in the lot Sunday, but there had been no
danger of an explosion. Valladolid said police had stepped up their
search for a fourth member of the IRA team.
   The IRA identified the three people killed as Mairead Farrell,
31; Daniel McCann, 30, and Sean Savage, 24. Although unarmed, they
were ``on active service,'' it said.

   Backers of a constitutional amendment to make
English the state's official language gathered about 260,000 new
signatures Tuesday, easily topping the number required to get on
the November ballot, a spokeswoman said.
   ``We are feeling very good,'' said Patricia Fulton, spokeswoman
for the Florida English Campaign.
   Taking advantage of primary election day, volunteers stationed
near polling places throughout the state collected about 60,000
signatures of registered voters, and workers from a California
company collected nearly 200,000, Ms. Fulton said.
   The new signatures, added to the 236,000 already in hand, should
put the movement at well beyond the 342,939 needed for a
referendum. About 125,500 of the signatures already have been
verified.
   The signatures were obtained despite the efforts of the League
of United Latin American Citizens, which took out advertisements in
Hispanic newspapers around the state warning voters about the
proposed amendment and urging them to register so that they could
vote against it in the general election.
   ``We're accused of being racist or xenophobics, because people
think we are anti-immigrants,'' said Dr. Mark LaPorta, chairman on
the Florida English Campaign.
   ``Nothing could be farther from the truth. My father was an
immigrant,'' LaPorta said. He insisted the measure was designed to
spur immigrants to learn the language and the ways of the United
States.
   LULAC and other Hispanic groups oppose the Florida and U.S.
English campaigns because they believed they have racist elements.
   If enough signatures are verified, the proposed referendum would
be submitted to the state Supreme Court for review of its wording.
   The referendum would ask voters to designate English as the
official language, but would leave it up the state Legislature to
decide what, if any, government practices would be changed.
   Proponent of the referendum, for example, would like to see the
government increase funds for English-language education.

<TEXT>
   A South African diplomat cited for
simple assault after his car struck a protester and a police
officer said Tuesday that he was sorry about the incident.
   South African Vice Consul Duke Kent Brown said during an
interview with radio station WJOY-WQCR that he did not expect the
group of anti-apartheid protesters to block his exit from a parking
lot near the radio station Monday.
   ``It's unfortunate that whole situation arose,'' he said.
   Brown was charged with simple assault, released on his own
recognizance and ordered to appear in court in April in connection
with the incident.
   The State Department said Brown had consular, rather than
diplomatic, immunity, meaning he was not automatically exempt from
prosecution. But he can claim immunity in court as an ``affirmative
defense'' on the grounds that the alleged acts were performed in
the exercise of his consular function.
   About 30 members of the Vermont Committee on Southern Africa had
gathered outside the station to protest Brown's participation in a
morning talk show, according to WJOY-WQCR news director Jim Condon.
   Brown said he had expected the protest to continue, but that ``I
would ignore them as I would leave.''
   Some of the protesters were on the hood of the car when it
accelerated, Condon said.
   Brown said he did not see the police officer, Todd Shepard, who
suffered bruises on his leg. ``I was very surprised to hear that a
policeman had been injured and I did apologize to him when I saw
him,'' Brown said.
   Brown said he was glad to hear that protester Laurie Larson of
Richmond was not badly injured. Larson suffered minor bruises.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who claims Israeli agents threw his
bride off a cruise ship to her death during their honeymoon in
retaliation for a book he wrote critical of Israel was charged
Tuesday with murder.
   Scott Robin Roston, first told authorities his wife, Karen Waltz
Roston, was blown overboard by a gust of wind while jogging on Feb.
13, and changed his story when authorities noted it wasn't windy
that night.
   Roston was indicted by a federal grand jury on a count of
second-degree murder under a statute covering killings aboard
ships. If convicted, he could be sentenced to life in prison.
   The Bahamian government has sought to extradite Roston, 36,
because the death took place when the couple were on the cruise
ship Stardancer, which is registered in that country.
   Under terms of its treaty with the United States, the Bahamas
cannot extradite Roston if he is convicted or acquitted in this
country, Assistant U.S. Attorney Patricia Collins said. He could
still faces charges there, however, if the U.S. trial ends in a
mistrial or hung jury, she said.
   Defense attorney Paul E. Potter said he will seek bail during a
hearing on Friday. Roston has been held without bail since his
arrest Feb. 15.
   Roston, who lives in Santa Monica, is the author of ``Nightmare
in Israel,'' published in 1987 by Vantage Press, a subsidy
publisher whose authors usually help pay for the cost of their
books.
   ``He feels that this murder is the result of a book he published
last year in New York City in which he exposed the numerous human
rights abuses which he perceived in Israel,'' Potter said after
Roston's arrest.
   Potter said Tuesday that the book is ``the key to the case.''
   The body of Mrs. Roston, 26, was recovered by the Coast Guard
and Roston was arrested when the ship docked in Los Angeles. They
had been married less than two weeks.
   Potter said ``he feels that she was murdered by Israeli secret
agents.''

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis ran away
with Maryland's Democratic presidential primary Tuesday, while Vice
President George Bush soundly defeated Kansas Sen. Bob Dole in the
Republican contest.
   Democratic Sen. Paul Sarbanes easily overcame two little-known
primary opponents in his bid for a third term. He will face Thomas
Blair, a millionaire newcomer to politics, who beat eight other
candidates for the Republican nomination.
   In the Democratic presidential race, with 643 of 1,574 precincts
or 41 percent reporting, Dukakis had 65,527 votes or 45 percent to
Jesse Jackson's 35,855 votes or 24 percent; Tennessee Sen. Albert
Gore Jr. had 15,506 votes or 11 percent; and Missouri Rep. Richard
Gephardt had 12,024 votes or 8 percent.
   Former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart finished with 5,713 votes or 4
percent; and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon tallied 4,740 votes or 3
percent.
   In the Republican primary, Bush gathered 25,870 votes or 54
percent to Dole's 14,643 votes or 31 percent, with 426 of 1,574
precincts or 27 percent reporting.
   New York Rep. Jack Kemp and former TV evangelist Pat Robertson
was next with 3,260 votes or 7 percent, followed by New York Rep.
Jack Kemp with 2,861 votes or 6 percent.
   Bush won despite a late effort by Dole that included a day of
campaigning by the Kansas senator in what his staff considered one
of his better Super Tuesday states.
   At stake were 41 GOP delegates and 67 Democratic delegates.
   Sarbanes' opponents in the Democratic primary were A. Robert
Kaufman, 56, a socialist who wants to use the campaign as a
platform to express his concerns about the economy and social ills
in the United States, and B. Emerson Sweatt, 44, who says he has
masterminded federal drug control efforts since 1970, is owed $6
million by the federal government and claims to be the only man on
Earth with a ``valid legal right to subpoena the entire Congress to
testify in a civil suit against the government.''
   Blair, a Montgomery County millionaire who had never run for
office, was the pre-primary favorite.
   Maryland got scant attention from the presidential contenders
despite the switch to Super Tuesday from the traditional May
primary, which Democratic leaders hoped would help the state play a
bigger role in the nominating process.

<TEXT>
   The Abu Nidal Palestinian terrorist group
freed a British relief agency official and his Syrian aide Tuesday,
five days after seizing them in this southern port city.
   Peter Coleridge, 44, Middle East coordinator of the British
relief agency Oxfam, and Omar Traboulsi, 31, appeared physically
fit when members of Abu Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary Council drove
them to the Sidon apartment of Mustafa Saad, a Sunni Moslem leader.
   ``We thank you for your hospitality,'' Coleridge said in Arabic
when they reached the apartment on the second floor.
   Abu Nidal's guerrillas seized them Thursday while Coleridge was
taking pictures of the Ein el-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp.
   Coleridge told reporters Tuesday: ``I am a guest in Lebanon. I
should have realized that shooting pictures at Ein el-Hilweh is a
big mistake.
   ``I made a mistake by not asking for a permission from the
authority in Ein el-Hilweh. I know and respect the people who took
us. There has been no kidnapping ... They were only applying
security procedures.''
   ``We were well treated,'' he added.
   Traboulsi sat next to Coleridge and did not speak. Coleridge
said he ``will leave Lebanon,'' but would not disclose his travel
plans.
   Coleridge told BBC Radio's ``PM'' program he and Traboulsi had
been interrogated, blindfolded, handcuffed and put into the trunks
of two cars.
   On Tuesday, Mustafa Saad identified the men involved as being
from Abu Nidal.
   Coleridge said they were driven to an isolated place about half
an hour from Sidon and held there for the rest of their captivity.
   Oxfam gave news of Coleridge's release to his wife, Angela, at
their home in Headington, England. The couple have three children _
Jessie, 12, Sara, 11, and Edward, 5.
   Mrs Coleridge said she and the children were ``overwhelmed and
absolutely delighted.'' She added, ``All I feel like doing now is
sitting down and having a nice, quiet cup of tea.''
   Coleridge said he heard no news of any other hostages, including
Anglican envoy Terry Waite, during his captivity. Waite disappeared
in Beirut in January 1987. No one has claimed responsibility.
   The release leaves leaves 22 foreigners still missing in
Lebanon, including nine Americans. Held longest is Terry A.
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press,
who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Coleridge and Traboulsi had gone to Sidon last week to inspect
relief groups supported by Oxfam. It was the British official's
first visit to Lebanon in three years.
   Coleridge said his camera and Opel station wagon were returned,
but a security source said the Palestinians ``confiscated the film
Coleridge was shooting.''
   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabry al-Banna, broke with Yasser
Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization in the early 1970s and
founded the Fatah-Revolutionary Council.
   His followers have been blamed for scores of terrorist acts,
including the December 1985 assaults at the Rome and Vienna
airports in which 20 people died.
   Coleridge and Traboulsi were accompanied to Saad's apartment by
Fatah-Revolutionary Council spokesman Walid Khaled.
   He said the men ``were held for questioning as a precautionary
measure after shooting pictures in military zones.''

   Joe Redington stole the lead of the
1,150-mile Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race on Tuesday as he and Herbie
Nayokpuk sailed past other mushers who had packed down a smooth,
fast trail for them.
   Redington, a Wasilla resident who is a founder of the
16-year-old race, and Nayokpuk, of Shishmaref, took their mandatory
24-hour layovers on Sunday. The race leaders passed them by, only
to get bogged down in freshly fallen snow as they crossed the
Alaska Range.
   The leading mushers then took their mandatory layovers at Rohn,
271 miles from the race's start in Anchorage. They watched
helplessly as Redington and Nayokpuk _ and less than two hours
later, Joe Garnie of Teller _ powered past them.
   ``I kind of have this feeling in the back of my mind that we're
going to see two Eskimos _ Garnie and Nayokpuk _ blazing across
this state,'' said Jerry Austin, one of the mushers taking a
layover at Rohn.
   Joe Runyan of Nenana was the first musher to leave Rohn, at
10:30 p.m. Monday. But he has not declared his 24-hour layover, and
so is behind Redington, who left Rohn at 7:20 a.m. Tuesday.
Nayokpuk left Rohn two minutes behind Redington. Garnie left at 9
a.m.
   Still at Rohn, in the order in which they arrived, were: Jan
Masek of Anchorage; Lavon Barve of Wasilla; defending champion
Susan Butcher of Manley; Jacques Philip of Thomery, France; Austin,
of St. Michael; Tim Moerlein of Kasilof; and, in 11th place,
two-time Iditarod champion Rick Swenson.
   From Rohn, the teams descend from the heights of the Alaska
Range into the timbered interior of the state for the longest
stretch between checkpoints in the race. Mushers must contend with
a bleak and treacherous area known as Farewell Burn before reaching
the next checkpoint, 93 miles away at Nikolai.
   The race is inspired by a 1925 dog sled relay that rushed
diphtheria serum to Nome during an outbreak of the disease. The top
20 mushers will split a purse of $150,000. The winner will get
$30,000.

   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. edged Jesse
Jackson to win North Carolina's Democratic presidential primary
Tuesday, while Vice President George Bush held off a late surge by
Kansas Sen. Bob Dole in the Republican race.
   With 2,270 of 2,387 precincts or 95 percent reporting, Gore had
224,514 votes or 35 percent; Jackson had 212,833 votes or 33
percent; Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis had 130,870 votes or 20
percent; Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt had 37,978 votes or 6
percent; and former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart had 15,842 votes or 2
percent.
   In the Republican race, with 2,279 precincts or 95 percent
reporting: Bush had 117,846 votes or 45 percent; Dole had 104,093
votes or 40 percent; Pat Robertson had 25,356 votes or 10 percent;
and New York Rep. Jack Kemp had 10,931 votes or 4 percent.
   Eighty-two Democratic delegates and 54 GOP delegates were up for
grabs in the third-largest of 14 Southern and border states holding
primaries.
   Dole strategists looked on North Carolina as one of their best
Southern prospects _ largely because the candidate's wife, former
transportation secretary Elizabeth Dole, is a native of Salisbury,
N.C.
   Polls published over the weekend showed Dole, who trailed by as
much as 15 percentage points two weeks ago, had pulled even with
Bush. A survey by the Charlotte Observer showed both with 38
percent.
   Kemp never developed a viable state campaign despite winning
support of the leaders of the National Congressional Club, Sen.
Jesse Helms' organization.
   Gore's appeal to Southern pride drew endorsements from Sen.
Terry Sanford, former Gov. Jim Hunt and dozens of state legislators
and local officeholders. Gore was in fourth place in a poll
published two weeks ago but appeared to be surging last week.
   Dukakis had the biggest paid North Carolina staff of any
candidate. Jackson announced his candidacy in Raleigh at the
convention of his ``Rainbow Coalition'' and reminded voters he had
attended college in the state.

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and
Vice President George Bush parlayed their neighborly ties into
overwhelming victories in Rhode Island's presidential primaries on
Tuesday.
   In the Democratic race, with 226 of 320 precincts or 71 percent
reporting, Dukakis crushed all challengers with 23,842 votes or 72
percent.
   Next came Jesse Jackson with 4,572 votes or 14 percent; Missouri
Rep. Richard Gephardt with 1,389 votes or 4 percent; Tennessee Sen.
Albert Gore Jr. with 1,294 votes or 4 percent; Illinois Sen. Paul
Simon with 837 votes or 2 percent; and former Colorado Sen. Gary
Hart with 518 votes or 2 percent.
   In the Republican contest, with 223 of 320 precincts or 70
percent reporting, Bush tallied 6,449 votes or 65 percent; Kansas
Sen. Bob Dole had 2,222 votes or 22 percent; Pat Robertson finished
with 590 votes or 6 percent; and New York Rep. Jack Kemp was last
with 476 votes or 5 percent.
   At issue were 22 Democratic and 21 Republican delegates.
   Dukakis, the governor of a neighboring state, and Bush, a New
England native, had both worked the state long before their
presidential campaigns officially began, and each picked up
endorsements from his party's top local political figures.
   Bush came to the state in 1986 to help two fellow Republicans,
Gov. Edward D. DiPrete and Rep. Claudine Schneider, win re-election
that year, and DiPrete and Schneider repaid the favor with vocal
support this year.
   Gore got a burst of publicity and built a sizable organization
as the result of a January visit to the state. Jackson made
headlines in November, when he took a Scituate elementary school
teacher with him on a trip to the Persian Gulf to deliver
children's presents to U.S. servicemen there.

   Rod Matthews killed, his attorney says,
because a prescription drug he took for school stoked the fires of
madness in his adolescent mind.
   In an ironic twist, Matthews' victim, 14-year-old Shaun
Ouillette, also took the drug, Ritalin, for years, using it, his
mother says, to cool the frantic behavior that plagued his
childhood.
   ``It calmed him down enough so we could help him,'' said Jeanne
Quinn, the victim's mother. ``I was so proud that he could learn to
manage his life.''
   Matthews, 15, is being tried as an adult on murder charges in
the Nov. 20, 1986, slaying of Ouillette. He has pleaded innocent by
reason of insanity.
   The defense has not disputed testimony that Matthews planned the
killing for a month, lured his victim to a secluded woods, then
stalked him from behind, hitting him repeatedly with a baseball bat.
   His friends have testified he told them of his plans, then
showed them the body on two separate occasions. One quoted Matthews
as saying he killed Ouillette because ``he wanted to know what it
was like to kill somebody.''
   Police testified how Matthews calmly lied to them about
Ouillette for the three weeks the boy's body lay in the snowy woods.
   The case is expected to go to the jury Wednesday.
   In testimony last week, Matthews' mother, Janice, said her son's
behavior had become a problem in the third grade and that he was
placed on Ritalin after a brief visit to his pediatrican.
   She cried as she told of the doctor's decision to prescribe the
drug, a stimulant long used to calm hyperactive children and those
with attention problems.
   The boy's doctor, Theodore Goodman, testified that he relied
only on what Mrs. Matthews told him. There was no testing and no
follow-up on the drug's effects.
   On Monday, psychiatrist Bernard Yudowitz testified that if a
child with mental illness is misdiagnosed and given Ritalin,
``impulsivity and abnormal behavior increase and their ability to
act appropriately in a given setting decreases.''
   ``In my experience if the child has an underlying mental
problem, Ritalin may not help and it may hurt,'' he said.
   Last week, Norman Bernstein, a Harvard-based child psychologist,
said Matthews ``had within him a world of angry, fearful
destructive thoughts.''
   Matthews attorney, John Philip White, said Ritalin contributed
to the boy's homicidal intent.
   ``In this case is the insidious element of mental illness with
the overlying thread of Ritalin,'' White told the jury.
   But on Tuesday, Marcel Kinsbourne, chief of behavioral neurology
at the Eunice Shriver Center in Waltham, said the drug could not be
considered a factor in the killing.
   Norfolk County Assistant District Attorney Peter Casey asked
Kinsbourne if the drug would have an ``enhancing effect'' on
Matthews' planning, execution and coverup of the slaying.
   ``Absolutely none whatever,'' he said.
   Mrs. Quinn, who listened from her front row seat, agreed.
   ``I don't believe it killed my son,'' she said. ``I suppose if I
were his parent, I would be looking for any way to explain what
happened, but Ritalin doesn't answer it for me.''
   Mrs. Quinn said her son took Ritalin from age 7 through 11 to
help calm his hyperactivity. The boy also received therapy, she
said.
   In the end, she said, it worked. The boy was weaned from the
drug and Shaun even told his mother he wanted to become a youth
counselor.
   ``A lot of the kids he saw in group therapy were messed up
kids,'' she said. ``He wanted to help and now it's all gone. What a
waste.''

   Gunmen in a car shot at a police station
Tuesday, killing one officer, and to cover their escape threw a
grenade into a courtyard where children were playing, authorities
reported.
   They said two suspects were arrested shortly after the attack,
but the prisoners were not identified.
   No group asserted responsibility for the attack. It came less
than a day after guerrillas of the Corsican National Liberation
Front vowed to intensify actions to win independence from France
for the island in the Mediterranean 125 miles off the French
mainland.
   Security Minister Robert Pandraud, speaking at Lunel in southern
France, condemned the killing and said: ``We will fight against the
murderers without pity.''
   Police said three or four people in a car fired pistols at the
police station, fatally wounding an officer who was hit twice in
the stomach.
   As they fled, the killers threw a hand grenade into a courtyard
where several policemen's children were playing, and one of the
children was treated for shock, according to authorities.
   Police said the car used in the attack was found abandoned in a
ditch near the police station.
   One of four masked members of the National Liberation Front,
speaking to reporters Monday near the town of Bastiaa, said:
``There is no question of establishing a truce. We are going to
pursue and even intensify our actions.'' The group has claimed
responsibility for several assassinations, including the Sept. 13,
1983, shooting of a top government official for northern Corsica.

   Jesse Jackson nudged Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore
to win Georgia's Democratic presidential primary Tuesday, while
Vice President George Bush swamped his Republican rivals.
   With 2,002 of 2,571 precincts or 78 percent reporting, Jackson
had 174,003 votes or 39 percent; Gore had 149,180 votes or 34
percent; Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis had 62,987 votes or 14
percent; Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt had 31,828 votes or 7
percent; and former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart had 13,116 votes or 3
percent.
   In the Republican race, with 1,922 precincts or 75 percent
reporting, Bush had 135,769 votes or 54 percent; Kansas Sen. Bob
Dole had 57,628 votes or 23 percent; Pat Robertson had 43,668 votes
or 17 percent; and New York Rep. Jack Kemp had 13,213 votes or 5
percent.
   The Republicans had 48 delegates up for grabs, with the
Democrats offering 77 delegates to their convention in Atlanta in
July.
   One of the state's best-known Democrats, former President Jimmy
Carter, withheld his endorsement. But another, Sen. Sam Nunn,
disclosed that he cast an absentee ballot for Gore because his
``views come closest to my own views as to the steps our nation
must take to meet our challenges at home and abroad.''
   GOP officials conceded Bush's association with Reagan and his
organization gave him the edge, but Robertson displayed
organizational strength in some precinct meetings last month.
   Jackson pulled off a surprise in 1984, winning southeastern
Georgia's 1st Congressional District, which includes Savannah.
Jackson's strong showing then was credited to a low Democratic
turnout combined with success in getting his supporters to the
polls.
   Dukakis made several other visits to the state, including stops
in Atlanta on the day he announced his candidacy and the day after
his victory in the New Hampshire primary.
   On Sunday, Dukakis stopped in for a half-hour visit with the
former president, who has met with all the other candidates at
various times.
   ``I think there's a great deal of compatibility between my basic
attitude towards government and that of Governor Dukakis,'' Carter
said afterwards.
   To encourage participation in the primary, state officials
included a referendum on broadening the eligibility for exemptions
for the elderly from some property and school taxes.

   Jesse Jackson elbowed past Tennessee Sen.
Albert Gore Jr. to grab Tuesday's presidential primary in
Mississippi, while Vice President George Bush left the rest of the
Republican field in the dust.
   Democrats also waged a spirited primary battle for the Senate
seat John Stennis is leaving after 41 years.
   In the Democratic race, with 1,750 of 2,340 precincts or 75
percent reporting: Jackson had 118,652 votes or 44 percent; Gore
had 91,337 votes or 34 percent; Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
had 22,661 votes or 8 percent; and Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt
had 14,996 votes or 6 percent. Former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart had
9,900 votes or 4 percent.
   In the Republican race, with 1,801 of 2,340 precincts or 77
percent reporting, Bush had won with 78,424 votes or 67 percent;
Dole had 19,547 votes or 17 percent; former TV evangelist Pat
Robertson had 15,115 votes or 13 percent; and New York Rep. Jack
Kemp had 4,289 votes or 4 percent.
   Forty Democratic delegates were at stake and 31 GOP delegates.
   In the Senate primary, Rep. Wayne Dowdy battled Secretary of
State Dick Molpus for the chance to run against Republican Rep.
Trent Lott in November for Stennis' seat. With 1,456 of 2,340
precincts or 62 percent reporting, Dowdy had 125,471 or 55 percent
to Molpus' 94,349 or 41 percent.
   Gilbert Founation, a Biloxi pipefitter, had 8,012 or 4 percent.
   Stennis, 86, announced last October that he would retire, making
this only the second time in 41 years that the state has had an
open U.S. Senate race.
   Dowdy, 44, who gained his congressional seat in a 1981 special
election, stressed his experience in Washington. Molpus, 38, touted
his record as director of federal-state programs under former Gov.
William Winter and his work as secretary of state since 1984.
   In recent weeks, Molpus made Dowdy's attendance record _ ranked
one of the five worst in the House according to Molpus _ a campaign
issue. Dowdy has countered that his voting mark is almost the same
as that of Stennis'.

<TEXT>
   The New Democratic Party government in
Manitoba, the only socialist administration in Canada's 10
provinces, was defeated Tuesday in a confidence vote.
   Premier Howard Pawley's government had been clinging to power
with a one-seat majority in the provincial legislature.
   But Jim Walding, a New Democrat legislator, voted with the
opposition Conservative and Liberal parties on a crucial budget
measure and the result was considered a vote of no confidence.
   The vote was 28-27 against the government.
   Opposition members pounded their desks victoriously after the
vote.
   ``Obviously we are in a very difficult situation,'' Pawley said,
and he indicated his party will meet Wednesday to decide whether to
call an early election.
   It is traditional in Canada for a government defeated on a major
measure considered to be a confidence vote to go to the polls.
   The crisis in Manitoba has national ramifications since Pawley
is the most active provincial opponent of the free-trade agreement
federal Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Conservative government
negotiated last year with the United States, but which has yet to
be ratified.
   Pawley also opposes a constitutional accord Mulroney secured
with the province of Quebec, recognizing the predominantly
French-speaking province as a ``distinct society.''

<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush jubilantly proclaimed
himself the man to beat in the Republican presidential sweepstakes,
saying his Super Tuesday performance ``exceeded my fondest
expectations.''
   Standing alongside his wife, Barbara, in a packed hotel ballroom
in his adopted home town, Bush said, ``As I said ... whoever wins
Super Tuesday convincingly is going to be the next president, and
I'll repeat it: I'm going to be the next president of the United
States.''
   ``This exceeded my fondest expectations,'' the vice president
said.
   ``You've given me and Barbara a big lift,'' Bush told
supporters. He and his wife had begun the day by casting their
ballots in the Texas GOP primary. Bush then went into seclusion in
the afternoon.
   Bush basked in the glow of his election triumphs only briefly,
giving a talk to supporters and greeting well-wishers in the
ballroom, which was decorated with Bush banners, the American flag
and red, white and blue balloons. His aides had said earlier Bush
would not accede to Sen. Bob Dole's demand that the vice president
appear in one-on-one, Lincoln-Douglas-style debates in Illinois.
   The vice president had awaited returns in a 21st floor penthouse
suite in the Westin Oaks Hotel, just a few blocks from the hotel
Houstonian, where he maintains a permanent residence. In
Washington, he lives in the official vice president's house.
   Bush brought to Houston two governors _ New Hampshire's John
Sununu and South Carolina's Carroll Campbell _ who had played
pivotal roles in his earlier victories in their states.
   Bush called his conquest of Dole and rivals Jack Kemp and Pat
Robertson ``a big, a major political victory. This is a national
victiory.''
   The vice president said he felt his performance Tuesday was a
reflection not of his campaign style but of his message ``to reduce
the deficit without raising taxes, to make progress toward peace
through strength, and making the United States strong ...''
   ``Reducing the threat of war is not a Republican issue and not a
Democratic issue,'' he said. ``It's a national issue.''
   Bush had no public activities scheduled for Wednesday and his
campaign aides planned to hold strategy sessins here.
   The vice president planned to fly to Chicago on Thursday for the
start of five days of intensive campaigning in the Illinois primary.

   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. emerged
king of the Democratic hill in Tuesday's presidential primary in
Arkansas, while Vice President George Bush brushed aside Republican
rivals.
   With 1,311 of 2,762 precincts or 47 percent reporting, Gore had
79,145 votes or 37 percent; Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis had
40,285 votes or 19 percent; Jesse Jackson had 37,772 votes or 17
percent; and Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt had 26,538 votes or 12
percent.
   In the GOP race, with 706 of 2,762 precincts or 26 percent
reporting, Bush had 14,527 votes or 48 percent; Kansas Sen. Bob
Dole had 7,913 votes or 26 percent; and former TV evangelist Pat
Robertson had 5,450 votes or 18 percent. New York Rep. Jack Kemp
had 1,387 votes or 5 percent.
   In the 1st Congressional District, veteran Democratic Rep. Bill
Alexander defeated political consultant Darrell Glascock, who went
to court to get on the ballot. Alexander had 41,552 votes, or 67
percent, to Glascock's 20,034, or 33 percent. No Republican sought
the office.
   Thirty-eight of Arkansas' 44 Democratic delegates and all 27 GOP
delegates were up for grabs.
   Turnout was expected to be low with the top state offices not on
the ballot because of a constitutional amendment that increased
terms from two years to four years beginning with the 1986
elections.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said the bus
hijacking in which three PLO guerrillas and three Israeli hostages
were killed was initiated by the same element that is behind three
months of anti-occupation rioting.
   ``These are the same people who incite violence in the
territories,'' Shamir said on Israel radio after Monday's attack in
southern Israel. ``We shall not tire fighting them.''
   Analysts said the attack, for which the Palestine Liberation
Organization claimed responsibility, was aimed at sabotaging the
United States' Middle East peace plan and will strengthen the
stance of Israeli hardliners.

   AIDS experts have sharply criticized a book by
the sex experts Dr. William Masters and Virginia Johnson that
claims to find wide spread of AIDS among heterosexuals.
   ``They have not done even the most rudimentary things to
establish any representativeness of their results,'' says Dr. June
Osborn, a virologist, pediatrician and dean of the school of public
health at the University of Michigan.
   In the book, released Monday and titled ``Crisis: Heterosexual
Behavior in the Age of AIDS,'' Masters and Johnson reported finding
a 5 percent AIDS infection rate in men who said they had at least
six sexual partners a year for five years, and a 7 percent
infection rate in similarly active women.

   A U.S. Supreme Court ruling about when companies
must disclose merger discussions could lead to fewer mergers and
hinder corporate competitiveness, some legal experts say.
   In Monday's ruling, the court affirmed for the first time a key
legal theory strengthening shareholder ability to sue a company for
fraud. Approval of the so-called fraud-on-the-market theory could
spawn a wave of new lawsuits by disgruntled shareholders, lawyers
said.
   The ruling stemmed from a case that attracted enormous attention
because it raised questions about a company's legal
responsibilities regarding disclosure of information that could
affect its stock price, including preliminary merger negotiations
with another company.

after the British government announced its soldiers had killed
three unarmed IRA guerrillas it said were preparing a terrorist
attack in Gibraltar.
   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said Monday that a
``dreadful terrorist act has been averted'' by the slayings in the
fortress colony on Spain's southern coast. ``The three people
killed were actively involved in the planning and attempted
excecution of that act,'' he told the House of Commons.

This would enable you to do some other things like prohibit

   Bill Britt, who repeatedly refused offers of food
and a warm home, died two weeks before his children discovered his
body, partially devoured by animals in the woods he called home
since 1969.
   Autopsy results Tuesday showed that Britt, 52, died of
hypothermia and was dead two weeks before he was discovered Monday
by two of his three children in his makeshift wigwam in Brookline,
according to the Suffolk County medical examiner's report.
   Britt died in the woods near the Chestnut Hill Reservoir, near
the affluent community of the same name where he was born and grew
up. He had lived in the woods since 1969, but did not attract much
attention until 1985, when officials tried to move him into public
or subsidized housing. Britt's resistance to being moved brought
him national attention; last May he appeared on ``Late Night with

buy the rights to his story.

   Today is Tuesday, March 15, the 75th day of 1988. There are 291
days left in the year. This is ``Buzzard Day'' in Hinckley, Ohio.
   Today's Highlight in History:
   On the Ides of March, 44 B.C., Roman Emperor Julius Caesar was
assassinated by a group of nobles that included Brutus and Cassius.
   On this date:
   In 1493, Christopher Columbus returned to Spain following his
first voyage to the New World.
   In 1767, the seventh President of the United States, Andrew
Jackson, was born in Waxhaw, South Carolina.
   In 1820, Maine became the 23rd state.
   In 1875, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York, John
McCloskey, was named the first American cardinal, by Pope Pius IX.
   In 1913, President Woodrow Wilson held the first open
presidential news conference.
   In 1919, the American Legion was founded, in Paris.
   In 1944, during World War II, the Italian town of Cassino was
devastated by Allied bombs.
   In 1956 the musical play ``My Fair Lady,'' starring Rex Harrison
and Julie Andrews, opened on Broadway.
   In 1964, Elizabeth Taylor married Richard Burton in Montreal. It
was her fifth marriage; his second.
   In 1965, before a joint session of Congress, President Lyndon B.
Johnson called for new legislation to guarantee every person's
right to vote.
   In 1966, rioting broke out in the Watts section of Los Angeles.
   In 1975, Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis died near
Paris at the age of 69.
   In 1977, the House of Representatives began a 90-day test to
determine the feasibility of showing its sessions on television.
   Ten years ago: Israel routed Palestinian guerrillas from at
least seven strongholds in southern Lebanon. And Israel said it
would keep its troops in a ``security belt'' it seized along its
northern border until an agreement was reached to ensure that the
area could no longer be used for attacks against Israel.
   Five years ago: Israeli Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir said he
was leaving Washington more optimistic about prospects of an
agreement on withdrawing Israeli troops from Lebanon.
   One year ago: Peggy Say, the sister of kidnapped Associated
Press correspondent Terry Anderson, said President Reagan was being
``unjustly castigated'' for his arms-for-hostages deal.
   Today's Birthdays: Actor Macdonald Carey is 75. Former astronaut
Alan L. Bean is 56. Actor Judd Hirsch is 53. Beach Boy Mike Love is
47. Rhythm 'n' blues star Sylvester ``Sly Stone'' Stewart is 44.
Rock guitarist Ry Cooder is 41.
   Thought for Today: ``No man has a right in America to treat any
other man tolerantly, for tolerance is the assumption of
superiority.'' _ Wendell Willkie, American politician (1892-1944).

   The week before Mikhail Gorbachev arrived in
the United States for the December arms summit, President Reagan
granted a rare interview to the four major networks' anchors.
   That's right, four: Peter Jennings of ABC, Dan Rather of CBS,
Tom Brokaw of NBC, and Bernard Shaw, Washington anchor for CNN.
   Although he had already interviewed Reagan in October, Shaw
agreed that the prime-time news special in which he questioned
Reagan along with the three other anchors was a high-profile symbol
of CNN's hard-earned respectability.
   ``That conversation the week before the summit was a turning
point, I suppose you would have to say,'' said Shaw in an interview
at his anchor desk at the CNN bureau. ``I went back and asked
(White House Chief of Staff) Howard Baker about that, and he said,
`We regard you as the fourth network, and that's why we included
you in the interview.'''
   The Reagan interview turned a lot of unsought attention on the
low-key Shaw, a former correspondent for ABC, CBS and Westinghouse
Broadcasting, who recalls idolizing Edward R. Murrow as a child in
Chicago and at 13 declaring, ``I want to be a CBS News
correspondent.''
   After stints with Westinghouse and CBS, then covering Latin
America for ABC, Shaw joined CNN in 1980. He wanted to be an
anchor, and ``there was no room at the inn at ABC, a lot of other
talented people standing in line.'' Plus, he was encouraged to join
the then-fledgling 24-hour news network by friends Daniel Schorr
and George Watson, the Washington bureau chief.
   The next year, John Hinckley shot President Reagan outside a
Washington hotel where Reagan had just delivered a speech.
   Shaw had finished his news update summarizing the speech and
switched back to CNN headquarters in Atlanta when a staffer told
him someone had fired shots at the president's motorcade.
   ``I screamed to the control room to tell Atlanta to come back to
us right away,'' Shaw said. Shaw filled viewers in with the sketchy
information he had, then switched back to Atlanta, but Reese
Schoenfield, then president of CNN, ordered Atlanta to go back to
Washington and stay there.
   ``And they did, and there we were,'' said Shaw. He was on the
air for 10 hours.
   ``I was pretty conscious that day of my demeanor, tone of voice
and facial expressions,'' he said, ``because that camera magnifies
everything, and I was determined to be as low-key as possible, as
factual as possible and as dispassionate as possible. A story like
that requires no heat.''
   Low-key is the operative word in describing Shaw's style. He
considers the celebrity aspects of his job ``corruptive'' and
prefers to spend his free time with his wife, Linda, and their two
children. Besides ``doing better'' in his job at CNN, Shaw, 47,
says his only ambition is to write books, fiction and non-fiction.
   He's a perfectionist who constantly worries about improving his
performance and the network's. He said that when he left the air
after the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries, he lay awake for hours
``replaying in my head what we did _ what we did right, what we did
wrong, what I could have done better.''
   ``He does his homework every time and worries over it like it's
his first time, and calls afterwards to be critiqued on it,'' said
CNN Executive Vice President Ed Turner. ``I don't know anybody as
good as he is, in my 30 years in the business, at his specialty,
which was a job once done brilliantly by (Walter) Cronkite, before
him by (Robert) Trout, people who can sit with a breaking story for
hours on end and never lose the various threads that you have to
keep hold of.''
   If it's grueling to be on the air for hours on end, it's also
fulfilling.
   While his colleagues at the other networks struggle to get even
an hour or two of prime-time coverage for the primaries, Shaw, who
anchors CNN's political coverage, gets the whole night.
   ``There was a magical moment, or hour, between 9 and 10 o'clock
in Manchester (N.H.),'' he recalled, ``and it seemed like every
candidate was coming down to the ballroom to make statements. And
it just looked like a visual ballet, where we went from Kemp to
Gephardt to Bush to Dole, or what have you. And I looked up on the
monitors, and we were the only ones on the air. And I felt good.''

   Super Tuesday might have resolved a few
political questions, but it has left the same old economic problems
to be dealt with _ or dodged.
   Biggest of these is the persistence of federal budget deficits
in defiance of the candidates, who one and all declare it
unconscionable that Uncle Sam should spend more than he receives.
   Everyone knows what has to be done to balance the budget, but
that's easy. The difficulty is in the accomplishment, and it is in
that area, says the Tax Foundation, that the candidates have proved
artful dodgers.
   Declaring its astonishment at the wishful thinking that serves
candidates in lieu of realistic tax and spending proposals, the
foundation's ``shadow committee on the federal budget'' expresses
despair.
   It suggests that the wishful, ``escapist'' thinking being
expressed by the candidates might be setting the stage for even
more deficits to come, perhaps even into the 21st century.
   To avoid the deficit issue, the group says, is to avoid not just
the issue of the budget itself but of many challenges included in
it, such as defense, space exploration, education, research, the
role of government and dozens more.
   Avoid the issue of the budget, and you avoid the issues that one
would expect to be discussed in a presidential election year.
   What especially irritates the committee is that candidates have
been churning out optimistic deficit projections that even a slight
underperformance by the economy might subvert. In other words,
committing the same old crime.
   ``With the structural deficit hovering around the $150 billion
mark, it will not take much of a shortfall in economic performance
to push the deficit to new record levels,'' it says.
   It is such evasion that created the deficits in the first place,
and it was the continuation of such thinking, more so than poor
economic performance, that perpetuated them.
   By avoiding the issues, Americans became accustomed to the
notion that, somehow, it was possible to have their cake and eat
it, too. Or, as President Lyndon Johnson put it, the nation could
simultaneously have guns and butter.
   The latest evasion of the deficit issue was given almost
official approval with the creation of an economic commission to
recommend taxes and spending cuts designed to reduce the deficit.
But its report won't come out until fall.
   Once again, the harsh reality was pushed off into the future,
allowing the candidates to discourse on more optimistic
possibilities. But, says the foundation, that's dreaming.
   To begin with, the committee's March report states, there is
little room for further cuts in defense spending, paring of grants
to states and localities and reductions in the operating budgets of
federal agencies.
   It points out that mandated payments for individuals, together
with interest charges, now comprise more than 60 percent of total
outlays, and those payments and interest charges are likely to
increase in years ahead.
   These huge payments are also for existing needs, but there is a
future to consider, too. And the future, always an unknown, is
likely to present more possibilities for spending, and therefore
more financial challenges.
   In the past, and it appears in the present, too, those
challenges have not been met. And now they are being evaded by the
very folks who want you to believe that it is they who should lead
the nation into the future.

<HEAD>Phone System Doesn't Ring Any Bells for Poles</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poland has many crushing problems:
burgeoning foreign debt, political dissension, inadequate social
services. But the one that rankles Poles the most is the telephone
system.
   There aren't enough telephones to go around, but people who do
have them find that if the phones themselves work, the system
doesn't.
   One man said he dialed his office in Warsaw three times in
succession and each time reached a different number.
   At a community newspaper, a reporter picked up the office's only
phone and got a dial tone.
   ``You are looking at a miracle,'' he said, holding up the
receiver. ``It works.''
   A Westerner living in Warsaw said her phone stopped working when
workmen started digging in her neighborhood; she was told she would
have to wait a month to have service restored.
   But the main thing is trying to get a telephone in the first
place.
   More than 2 million applications for telephones are pending in
Poland and the list is growing faster than phones are being made
and installed. The average waiting period is 13 years, but some
have been waiting 20 years or more.
   ``Like other areas of our economy, the situation is not
satisfactory at the moment,'' said Roman Gebka, director of the
telecommunications service for the state telephone and telegraph
company.
   ``The basic problems now are a lack of equipment, a lack of
cables ... and a lack of work force.''
   Poland has just 2.6 million telephone subscribers in its
population of 37.5 million _ about 7 subscribers for each 100
people. Subtract phones in offices and other public places, and
that comes to just 1.8 million private phone customers.
   Altogether Poland has 11 actual telephone sets for every 100
people; the United States has 79, Sweden 85, and Great Britain and
West Germany 51 each.
   In the countryside the problem is particularly acute. For 14.8
million Poles in rural areas there are just 285,000 telephone
subscriptions. And about 7,000 villages have no phones at all.
   But even people lucky enough to get phones have problems _
broken connections, buzzing or rattling noises on the line,
mysterious misdirection of phone calls.
   Not having a telephones is a fact of life in Ursynow, a
sprawling planned community of apartment blocks on the outskirts of
Warsaw. For its 135,000 people, it has 4,000 private telephones and
102 pay phones that often don't work. The commmunity eagerly awaits
a central switching station that will allow 10,000 more phones.
   Many Poles do their telephoning while on the job, using the
company phones. They also can try one of the nation's 85,000 pay
phones, some of which work.
   Hotel operators, restaurateurs and even private householders are
usually willing to let others use their phones, for free or
sometimes for a small fee.
   The cost of the lack of phones for Poland's economy is very high
and the prospects for any improvement soon are dim, Gebka said in
an interview in his office at the state telephone company in
Warsaw. He cited a Soviet study that said one ruble invested in
telephones led to three rubles in increased income.
   Gebka said the ideal would be 20 million telephones in Poland by
the year 2000, or one for each of each of the 16 million to 17
million families expected by then, and the remainder for government
and business.
   But he added that short of a miracle Poland would not come near
that goal. Using all its currently available resources, Poland can
manage to install only about 150,000 phones a year.
   ``Polish industry is as it is,'' he said. ``It produces as much
as we are able to in this country. Everything that the industry
produces is being installed. There are no reserves.''
   To step up production of telephone equipment and cable, he said,
Poland must build new factories.
   Factories take five or six years to build and putting in
additional telephone exchange stations takes about three more
years, so it will take nearly a decade before Poland can begin to
speed up installations, Gebka said.
   He also blamed part of the equipment shortage on the U.S.-led
trade embargo that bans high-technology sales to the East bloc.
Poland's international calling capabilities are particularly
hampered by the embargo, he said.
   The Warsaw telephone exchange, which can handle up to 20,000
subscribers, is a long two-story building, about the size of an
average elementary school in the United States. If Poland had
equipment using Western microprocessors, the whole operation could
fit into a single room, said Janusz Cienecki, the engineer in
charge of the center.
   Besides lacking the most sophisticated equipment, he said, the
state-run telephone system has difficulty attracting qualified
technicians because the starting pay is just 26,000 zlotys ($69) a
month.
   A government report in February said more than 60 percent of the
urban telephone systems are outdated and need modernization.
   Communications Minister Antoni Rajkiewicz has set a goal of
adding 12 million new telephones in Poland by 2010, but says it all
hinges on increasing production capabilities of telephone equipment.
   In the meantime, most Poles just wait.

political parties are parodied as rival baseball teams and the
jibes are never too strong. Nevertheless, Shim says, it is a
remarkable change.
   ``In the past it was a taboo to caricature the big political
names in this country,'' he said.
   Ridiculing the president or making jokes about him, for example,
were seen as anti-state acts.
   Shim and other cartoonists have been able to take advantage of
recent political liberalization in South Korea to start injecting a
little laughter and ridicule into politics.
   The cartoonists contend that political caricature is healthy and
Korean politics can benefit from it.
   ``Cartoons and caricatures will bring the political leaders
closer to the people,'' Shim maintained.
   Political cartoons have proliferated in newspapers and magazines
and command large, enthusiastic audiences eager for a regular flow
of material ranging from traditional editorial cartoons to long
stories. Literacy is very high in South Korea but people prize
cartoons for their humor.
   Newspaper cartoons so far are low-key and ironic. Some recent
ones showed caricatures of the main political parties chasing each
other in an unending circle, to symbolize ineffectiveness. Another
showed top leaders as squabbling babies.
   A favorite of cartoonists is to have bemused Koreans staring at
politicians battling for power and asking what is happening to the
country.
   ``It is refreshing to see the taboos broken about the myths
surrounding the political bigwigs,'' said Han Kye-su, a political
analyst who has followed the growth of political cartooning.
   Many cartoonists say they have always seen their work as a way
of calling for reform and liberalization.
   ``Korean cartoonists have been struggling for political change
for a long time,'' Shim said.
   Cartoons are a valuable teaching tool that can vividly explain
the meaning of an issue as well as amuse readers, Shim added.
   ``The political cartoonist can present the issues in a more
amusing, but understandable manner to the public.''
   The newly installed President Roh Tae-woo, who pledged freedom
of speech and expression after years of authoritarian rule,
personally encouraged cartoonists to take up political subjects by
saying he did not mind being caricatured.
   Shim and other cartoonists say their work is still very gentle
and restrained for fear of angering authorities and losing what
freedom they have. But they say they expect to make their humor
more biting as time goes on and liberalization expands.
   Cartoonists are also restrained by fear of offending a
politician's supporters, Shim said. Korea's factional politics
stress loyalty and supporters tend to resent any joke at their
leader's expense, he said.
   ``The reaction can be terrible from the supporters,'' Shim said.
``People should learn to accept both positive and negative.''
   Anti-government students and dissident groups, which have long
used cartoons in their political literature, also are making
greater use of caricatures, but usually not in a humorous way.
   The cartoons distributed at anti-government rallies and meetings
are biting and bitter. Government and mainline opposition
politicians are depicted as vicious tyrants suppressing the people
with tear gas and clubs. Some are more subtle, depicting the
divided opposition leaders as crying infants quarreling over a toy.
   ``They are not jokes,'' said one dissident. ``They show the
people the reality of the government and why there is no democracy
in South Korea.''
   Anti-government cartoons are distributed in pamphlets on college
campuses or posted on trees and sidewalks at anti-government
rallies.
   The United States, represented by a fiendish-looking Uncle Sam
or a swaggering and bullying American soldier, is a fixture in the
underground cartoons. Dissidents claim the country's successive
authoritarian governments have survived because of U.S. backing.
   One recent cartoon showed a tough-looking Statue of Liberty with
a boxing glove on her upraised hand.
   Shim and other cartoonists reject their underground competition
and the radical politics behind it. They say change must be
moderate.
   ``It's too early to expose politicians to a more revealing
fashion,'' Shim said.

<HEAD>Star Watch: And Vadim Continues to Create Women</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty-two years ago, Roger Vadim made the
little-known Brigitte Bardot an international star with a movie
called ``And God Created Woman.'' In 1988, the French director
hopes to do the same with Rebeccca DeMornay.
   Not that the California-born, European-educated actress is
unknown. She made a sensational film debut as the hooker who helped
Tom Cruise conduct his ``Risky Business.'' Roles in ``Testament,''
``Runaway Train,'' ``The Trip to Bountiful'' and other films have
also been well reviewed.
   ``And God Created Woman'' provides her best role yet. And if you
want to stay on her good side, don't suggest a comparison to how
Bardot played the role of a teen-age girl who was fatally attracted
to men.
   ``There's really no relation between the two pictures,'' she
insists. ``They have the same title and the same director. But
really the title was used to get the film (financed) and really has
no relation to the story or the characters.''
   ``It's more a variation on the same theme than a remake,'' said
Vadim. ``What happened to a young girl at St. Tropez in the south
of France in 1956 can't really happen today in Santa Fe, N.M.''
   Vadim, who masterminded the careers of Bardot, Catherine Deneuve
and Jane Fonda and married Bardot and Fonda, was limited in his
choice of a star for ``And God Created Woman'' because the
producers, Vestron, didn't want to go with an unknown.
   Comparing her role to Bardot's, was ``like comparing apples and
oranges,'' DeMornay said. She outlined her own version of the
character she played: ``Robin is very mischievous, also naive and
therefore funny a lot of the time. What attracted me to her was her
strong streak of independent feminism. It might be disguised in her
antics, but she really is a woman's woman.''
   About Vadim: ``He is great to work with, very perceptive, very
sensitive to me as a woman. And as an actress and the protagonist
in this film. It seemed very easy for him to identify with a woman,
which is not easy for male directors. He's very laid-back and
created an aura of relaxation on the set.''
   The first ``And God Created Woman'' raised a furor among
censors; the title was changed in Italy, because the authorities
``didn't want God associated with such a film,'' Vadim recalled.
   He still wonders what all the fuss was about: ``There was no
nudity; Bardot was naked only once and was covered by a sheet. I
think the censors were infuriated because she played a woman who
had no guilt about her sexuality.''
   The 1988 version goes further with nudity and sex, though Vadim
insists he strove for a romantic feeling to the bedroom scenes. And
eroticism presents no problem for DeMornay.
   ``I've done two women so far whose sexuality was part of the
character,'' she said. ``Robin in `And God Created Woman' was one
of them (the other: `Risky Business'). It's delightful to me, if I
can trust the sensibilities of the director, which I did, and if
the scenes further the plot and illustrate facets of the
character.''
   Are such scenes nervous-making on the set?
   ``Not to me,'' she said. ``It's as natural as anything else. I
don't see this wall: `I'll do anything as an actress, but I won't
express sexuality.' Why not?''
   The blond beauty was born in Santa Rosa, Calif., 25 years ago
but spent her childhood abroad. Her parents divorced and her father
is TV personality Wally George.
   ``My stepfather died, and this made my mother restless,'' she
said. ``She started to travel with both me and my brother. She was
a very free-spirited, bohemian-type woman who thought a good
education could be had by traveling and learning about new
countries and cultures.
   ``So I lived in England for five years, in the Austrian Alps for
seven years and in a lot of other countries in between for smaller
amounts of time.''
   Returning to California in 1981, the actress enrolled at the Lee
Strasberg Theater Institute, found an agent and won the ``Risky
Business'' role over 800 applicants.
   Surprisingly, the film didn't get her typed: ``I was lucky. Most
people seemed to view me as an actress playing the part of a call
girl. I wasn't offered a lot of prostitute roles. I was able to
play a young mother in `Testament' with Jane Alexander. Then `The
Trip to Bountiful' with Geraldine Page. Then a scruffy, tomboyish
train mechanic in `Runaway Train.' So I've had good opportunities.''
   What's next? She's brushing up on her Shakespeare.

<HEAD>The Artists: Musicians Wanted: Only Robots Need Apply</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BEN DOBBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A flutist with rubber lips, metal fingertips and
not much else by way of physique is the latest graduate of the
McAndroids laboratory in south London.
   Being a robot and brand-new, it doesn't have a name yet, but its
first public recitals will be given in September, when it goes on
display at Taiwan's new National Museum of Natural Science.
   The flutist was born in the same cluttered workshop as Tin Twin,
the guest keyboard player who thrilled teen-age fans of the
Thompson Twins, a British pop group, on its 1986 world tour.
   Like Tin Twin, the flutist is a robotized ``musician'' developed
by McAndroids Ltd., a special effects and 3-D animation team
composed of two sculptors, a mechanical engineer and a computer
artist.
   McAndroids' art and technology creations have been on display
since 1984 in museums, traveling exhibitions and on TV shows across
Western Europe.
   The flutist is going to T'aichung in Taiwan along with a
collection of musical instruments that visitors will be able to
play without touching. Set inside glass cases, the flute, organ,
tubular bells, 16-string Chinese zither and drum kit are activated
by pressing buttons.
   ``It's very much a hands-on, discover for yourself exhibit,''
said sculptor Richard Glassborow. ``On one level it's
entertainment; on another level it's seriously stimulating.''
   The push buttons give spontaneous but precise control of the
robotics that work the instruments. They can pluck out individual
notes or create pulsating effects such as vibrato, tremolo or echo.
   Musical phrases, such as a bass line, can be instantly recorded
and the playback accompanied by improvisation. The instruments also
can be commanded to play a simple preprogrammed tune.
   ``It was a choice to make it simple,'' said Glassborow. ``If you
make it very rich, they (the public) just stand and look at it. We
wanted to make it very friendly.''
   The flute's robotics are the most impressive, employing the head
and pneumatically controlled fingers of a humanoid robot, or
android. A valve controls the air that is pumped through the
delicately positioned rubber mouthpiece into the lip plate.
   The instruments took three months to build and were sold to the
designers of the museum's soundproof ``cacophony section'' for
nearly $87,000.
   They demonstrate an individual's musical inventiveness and allow
those without any musical skills to play music, according to
Glassborow.
   Tin Twin is a more readily recognizable android, with long arms
that flit across the keyboard in simulating such smash hits of The
Thompson Twins' as ``Doctor Doctor'' and ``Sister of Mercy.''
   From a distance, the flashing lights in its eyes and outh give
the impression that it is singing along in the chorus.
   McAndroids is made up of the 39-year-old Glassborow; Alan Dun, a
37-year-old sculptor; engineer John Barron, 34; and Trevor Piper, a
32-year-old artist. The company has found a niche in a fast-growing
European market for special effects.
   In 1986, its three robotic ``French heads,'' composed of
odd-shaped pieces of steel and glass fiber on top of tall poles,
turned real heads at a robot sculpture display in the Georges
Pompidou Center in Paris.
   Vaguely resembling outer-space creatures, they turn to watch
passers-by, stop and stare back, or babble among themselves in
jolly jingles. A museum in Glasgow, Scotland, is negotiating for
display rights.
   Another favorite is a set of nine jack-in-the-box Irish
caricatures, including a priest, a bar wag and a politician, who
pop up at the push of a button to give speeches on the environment.
It was bought for an exhibition center in Northern Ireland's
Sperrin Mountains.
   The company plans to build an android orchestra, a robotized
skeleton riding a bicycle and a mechanical plant that will respond
to temperature, light and human activity, such as people quarreling.
   ``Anyone catching sight of the plant would say, `I know what
it's thinking,''' said Glassborow. ``This kind of work is a kind of
mirror to human behavior.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Ziggy Marley Carries on Reggae Tradition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At the age of 19, reggae artist Ziggy Marley has
seen enough of the world to know he wants to change it.
   ``I am not blind,'' Marley says. ``Even in Jamaica, injustice
happened. It happened all over the world. It means something all
over the world.''
   On the Melody Makers' new album, ``Conscious Party,'' Marley
sings of oppression, bigotry and hope for a better world.
   For anyone who follows reggae music, Marley's political
consciousness should come as no surprise. The late Bob Marley,
Ziggy's father, was reggae's most celebrated artist and famous for
such protest songs as ``Get Up, Stand Up'' and ``I Shot the
Sheriff.''
   But while acknowledging the legacy of his father, Ziggy Marley
is determined to establish his own identity. ``I want to be
fulfilled myself rather than try to follow exactly in my father's
footsteps.''
   Marley was born on October 17, 1968, in Trenchtown, an
impoverished section of Kingston in Jamaica. When he was 11, he
formed the Melody Makers along with his brother, Stevie, and
sisters, Cedella and Sharon.
   The Melody Makers' first song, ``Children Playing in the
Streets,'' was written by their father. In 1985, they released
their first album, ``Play the Game Right,'' which received a Grammy
nomination for best reggae record. In 1986, they released the album
``Hey World.''
   ``We're brothers and sisters,'' Marley said. ``Doing music was
part of being a family.''
   ``Hey World'' contained such overtly political songs as the
anti-apartheid ``666,'' and on the new album, he continues to
confront injustice with songs such as ``Tomorrow People,'' the
first single to be released.
   ``Tomorrow People, think of your past,'' he sings, attacking
those who think only of the future and their indifference to
humanity.
   ``The original idea was from robots, like the movie `Robocop' _
people becoming androids,'' Marley said. ``Scientists are making
dangerous things.''
   Although ``Conscious Party'' is only Marley's third album, he is
already attracting the attention of some of the music industry's
most highly acclaimed artists. Talking Heads members Chris Frantz
and Tina Weymouth produced the record and Rolling Stones guitarist
Keith Richards plays on the song ``Lee and Molly.''
   ``Lee and Molly'' is a story about racial bigotry. Lee is a
white man who dates Molly, a black woman, and is beaten up by his
father because of the relationship. The song is based on an actual
couple who went to high school in Kingston with Cedella Marley.
``He (Lee's father) thought going out with Molly set a bad
example,'' Cedella recalled.
   Ziggy Marley identifies strongly with the people of Africa. On
``Tumbling Down,'' he uses the symbols of the Eagle, the Bear and
the Lion to warn against the consequences of superpower oppression
of the third world.
   ``The Eagle is the United States and their allies. The Bear is
the Soviet Union because of what they've done in Ethiopia and
Afghanistan,'' Marley said. ``The Lion is Africa. Bad things are
done against my people. Consequences will come down on you.''
   Marley also sings about Africa on the ballad ``Dream of Home.''
   ``Home is Africa,'' Marley said. ``We know that's where we
originated from. We have to get rid of (South African President
P.W.) Botha. Through ourselves, our music, we fight apartheid.
   ``New Love'' is the album's only love song, although it's more
about the spiritual quality of love rather than a particular person.
   ``My love is always new; it shouldn't get boring,'' Marley said.
``Love can hurt you, like Lee and Molly. But new love is like the
sun rising. Like the morning dew.''
   Marley is a Rastafarian and religion plays an important role in
his life and music. On ``A Who a Sey,'' he attacks those who do not
share his belief in a higher being.
   ``My religion is a way of life. If I please Jah (God), I will
please many more people,'' he said.
   The Melody Makers started touring in 1975 and have appeared at
shows with Stevie Wonder, The Clash, the late Peter Tosh and Jimmy
Cliff. They performed at Reggae Sunsplash last August in Jamaica.
With a worldwide tour scheduled to begin in April, Marley is
anxious to play his new songs in front of a live audience.
   ``It's like relating to people. Like me talking to you,'' Marley
said. ``That is where the people feel the music and feel with you.
I'm dealing with people.''
   Marley hopes his music will help bring about his vision for a
better world.
   ``We have the obvious,'' he said. ``No war. No pollution. A
better life for human beings. No prejudice. Everybody has an
opportunity. Everybody has the basic things.
   ``People say they live and then die. I don't believe in death.
We believe in live and live. We believe in life. We are the
people.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Schools and Business: When Worlds Collide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Probably the best development affecting the
nation's beleaguered public schools is also among the least
noticed: the growing alliance between educators and the business
world.
   At a time when schools have been barraged by critics in the
Reagan administration and elsewhere, along comes Burger King,
Honeywell, Metropolitan Life and others in the corporate community
who not only are arguing public education's case, but are putting
considerable money where their mouths are.
   A new book, ``American Business and the Public School: Case
Studies of Corporate Involvement in Public Education'' (Teachers
College Press, $24.95), offers a valuable, scholarly dissection of
this budding relationship between these formerly estranged
bedfellows, and it explodes several myths in the process.
   The 278-page book was edited by Marsha Levine, an official of
the American Federation of Teachers, and Roberta Trachtman,
affiliated with the City University of New York. Their book argues
that self-interest is too simple an explanation for the recent
upsurge in corporate interest in better schools.
   ``Business doesn't get involved in education just because it
needs skilled workers,'' argues Owen B. ``Brad'' Butler, retired
chairman of Procter & Gamble who wrote a foreward to the book.
   ``Most big companies are multinational,'' Butler said during a
recent visit to New York. ``They can find the workers they need
somewhere. The primary interest they have in better schools is that
the United States is their home base, and business can't remain
healthy unless the United States remains peaceful, prosperous and
democratic.''
   The book completes a trilogy of studies commissioned by the
Committee for Economic Development, a research organization
dominated by top business executives which Butler chairs. The two
earlier reports, ``Investing in Our Children,'' published in 1985,
and ``Children in Need,'' published last September, were each
front-page blockbusters.
   Those previous reports, which called for such innovations as
massive new governmental investments in programs to help the
neediest students, forced all who had typecast business executives
as socially callous arch-conservatives to reconsider.
   The latest book, while not as headline-making, will likely be
the most enduring of the three. And like its predecessors, this
report challenges some widely held notions about the nature of
business-corporate partnerships.
   It offers, for the first time, useful detailed case histories of
business-school partnerships that work, written by insiders. A key
ingredient seems to be a new willingness on the part of business to
enter such relationships as partners, rather than superiors.
   Metropolitan Life's chairman, John Creedon, is presented as
having ``profound respect for education and educators.'' The
company's involvement in school reform has become renowned through,
among other things, an annual survey of teacher attitudes it has
conducted for the past several years.
   What's in it for Met Life? Three things, according to the book:
its view that it has obligations to the nation as a corporate
citizen; its desire to ensure future employees have needed job
skills; and a belief that well-informed citizens are better
insurance risks.
   Honeywell, the Minneapolis-based computer firm, first became
interested in education in the 1970s and decided that it had to
help local school districts develop better curricula.
   In Seattle, for example, Honeywell employees invited citizens in
Snohomish County, Wash., to figure out ways to ``prepare students
for a high technology future in a low technology environment.'' The
result is a school-business partnership dubbed LINK.
   Burger King, meanwhile, has developed an awesome array of
educational programs since 1983, from fast-food management courses,
to scholarship programs and even a curriculum on crime prevention.
The company also honors 100 principals and teachers each year. The
budget for such programs has grown from $1.5 million in 1983 to
$3.9 million in 1986. Some 3,000 workers in 900 restaurants have
benefitted from the programs.
   ``The long-term benefit we are seeking is a consistent, unified
public perception of Burger King as a good corporate citizen,''
writes Burger King's Barbara Gothard. ``People come to Burger King
because of quality, service and value. But they are also influenced
by their perception of how good is the company backing the
product.''
   ``Seven or eight years ago, it was difficult to imagine that
this would occur, that business and education would become so
interested in each other,'' said C. Michael Timpane, president of
Columbia Teachers College. ``Now business isn't just looking at
narrow job skills. They realize two things: that people change
jobs, and jobs themselves change.
   ``When educators looked at that, they thought that this was very
congenial. Business was asking us to do what we wanted to do all
along _ only better.'' For anyone interested in understanding one
of the most heartening developments of the 1980s, this book is an
excellent place to start.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Jim Horn And His Bulging Resume</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jim Horn has played on records by George
Harrison, Frank Sinatra and the Beach Boys. He's played in movies
with Elvis Presley and Spencer Tracy.
   And he's played the theme songs for such TV shows as ``The Odd
Couple'' and ``The Courtship of Eddie's Father.''
   Harrison, the ex-Beatle, recruited him for the historic 1971
concert and movie, ``Concert for Bangla Desh.'' He was part of the
famous ``Mad Dogs and Englishmen'' concert tour in 1970 that
propelled Joe Cocker to star status.
   The public may not have heard of Jim Horn, but in recording
circles in the United States and Europe he's a versatile
instrumentalist.
   ``I've been around awhile and I've been able to do some
things,'' he says modestly about his 25-year music career and a
resume bulging with achievements.
   His specialty is the saxophone, but he also plays the flute,
piccolo and recorder. Over the years, he's played a multitude of
other instruments while being associated with many of the top names
in show business.
   He can be heard playing his horn on Harrison's latest hit LP,
``Cloud Nine.''
   ``His (Harrison's) singing sounded better than ever,'' Horn said
in an interview before a recording session with country star Hank
Williams Jr. ``And when he plays, you know it's him _ that slide
guitar.''
   Horn worked with another former Beatle, Paul McCartney, a year
ago when McCartney helped produce an album by guitar legend Duane
Eddy.
   ``He (McCartney) worked with the musicians well,'' he recalled.
``Everyone knew what to do. He was real jovial and funny, cracking
jokes. He was fun to work with.''
   Presley, too, was a free spirit when Horn played in the movies
``Girls, Girls, Girls'' and ``Roustabout.''
   ``He liked to sit around and play,'' Horn said. ``He'd `jam.' He
was into karate and he'd break wood when the producer and director
weren't around. They didn't like him doing that.''
   Sinatra, for whom Horn played flute on the hit ``Strangers in
the Night,'' was businesslike and a quick worker.
   ``He'd rehearse once and then do one take,'' Horn recalled. ``He
made it relaxed. He was a real pro.''
   It was Horn's piccolo playing on the Beach Boys' hit ``Good
Vibrations.''
   ``People like their Hawaiian shirts and visualize themselves on
the sand with a beer in their hand,'' he said. ``The Beach Boys
make fun music and they didn't let it die.''
   Horn, who lists his age as ``as old as the Beatles,'' was born
in Compton, Calif., and spent most of his life in Los Angeles.
While living there, he played music in the movies ``Guess Who's
Coming to Dinner'' starring Tracy, Katharine Hepburn and Sidney
Poitier, ``Grease,'' ``Footloose,'' ``Shaft,'' ``Stayin' Alive''
and many others.
   He moved to Nashville four years ago and is now working on his
own album of sax instrumentals, ``Neon Nights.''
   He learned how to play the piano at age 7, the trumpet at age 9
and the sax at age 12.
   ``The sax was a real popular instrument when I learned,'' he
said. ``There was a sax solo on every record. I wanted my own band
and wanted to be able to do solos. I thought they were a whole lot
of fun.''
   He said he correctly developed his talent and always worked to
get better.
   ``I practiced a lot as a kid. I learned the proper way to play,
then listened to albums, especially the sax solos, and played along
with them. It gave me insight. I concentrated on my `ear.'''
   Even today, he's constantly updating his style and listening to
music for trends.
   ``I hear songs on the radio and then I may change my style a
little,'' Horn said. ``But I have the same conviction. Some
musicians are lazy. They won't buy new equipment. You have to
change with the times. It's easier to relate to music that way. I
listen to pop and rock on the radio a lot and switch back and
forth.''
   He owns seven saxes, four flutes and five recorders. His most
expensive instrument is a $4,000 baritone sax.
   Despite his success, some instruments have given him trouble. He
played the oboe and English horn for records by the Carpenters, but
later gave them up.
   ``They were too demanding,'' he said. ``You had to make your own
double reeds. It was too time consuming.''
   And he can't master the harmonica, which even school kids can
play with little training.
   ``I'm trying,'' he admitted. ``I can't get the hang of it. I'm
used to blowing out.''

   ``Born to Be Bad'' (Rounder) _ George Thorogood and the
Destroyers
   
   Albums are really superfluous for George Thorogood and the
Destroyers. This is a bar band, and a very good one, whose music is
best heard in a sweaty bar instead of a living room.
   But commerce calls. Thorogood must fulfill a record contract,
and ``Born to Be Bad'' is the latest product.
   If ``Born to Be Bad'' sounds a little familiar, it should. It
comes six years after ``Bad to the Bone.'' What's next _ ``Born to
Be Bone?'' Or ``Born in the Badlands?'' How about just plain
``Bad?'' Maybe that's too familiar.
   There aren't many things that distinguish ``Born to Be Bad''
from any other George Thorogood album since his 1977 debut. The
band's sound has become fuller over the years with the addition of
a saxophone player and a rhythm guitarist, but the content is
largely the same.
   ``Born to Be Bad'' has the obligatory Chuck Berry tune (``You
Can't Catch Me''), the traditional sinister guy song (title track),
the dance floor stomper (``Shake Your Money Maker''), paens to the
fairer sex (``I Really Like Girls'') and some blues to highlight
Thorogood's mean guitar.
   Familiarity doesn't have to breed contempt. The production is
crisp and the playing inspired, so most of side 1 genuinely cooks.
Side 2 flags considerably because of the repetition and one slow
blues song too many.
   Do yourself a favor. Save the money you may be inclined to spend
on ``Born to Be Bad'' until the Destroyers happen to come to town.
You shouldn't have to wait too long, although they may not
duplicate their 1981 feat of playing in 50 states in 50 days. Buy a
ticket to the concert, grab a dance partner, and have fun.

   ``If My Heart Had Windows'' (MCA) _ Patty Loveless
   
   Patty Loveless' new album consists of 10 songs, and the writing
credit is different on each. But Loveless' singing and the
production of Emory Gordy Jr. and Tony Brown make the album into a
cohesive set that's as country as grits.
   ``If My Heart Had Windows'' includes a honky-tonk waltz (the
title cut, by Dallas Frazier); country swing (Hank Williams' ``I
Can't Get You Off of My Mind''); and plenty of ballads.
   Loveless' full-throated alto really hits its stride on side 2,
climaxing on John and Johanna Hall's ``Fly Away,'' which lives up
to its name with a soaring chorus reminiscent of the Halls' defunct
pop group, Orleans.
   The arrangements, built around the solid rhythm section of
Leland Sklar and Eddie Bayers, include such nice touches as a steel
and fiddle playing in unison on the break of ``I Can't Get You Off
of My Mind.'' The material occasionally sags, but most of the album
contains strong and honest performances.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Stand and Deliver''</HEAD>
<HEAD>A Thinking Man's ``Rocky''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Stand and Deliver'' is a kind of thinking man's ``Rocky'':
melodramatic, full of street-level emotion, with a knockout of an
ending that may even convince you that good can occasionally
triumph against implausible odds.
   But what's so special about this movie is that the knockout is
scored not with fists, but with the power of young minds.
   It is an inner city classroom drama based on true events at
Garfield High School in the East Los Angeles barrio, a failing
school so tough it faced losing its accreditation in 1982.
   Into this mess strides Jaime Escalante (Edward James Olmos), a
computer specialist who has dropped out of the business world to be
a teacher. His first surprise is that the school has no computers.
He is assigned to a math class.
   Olmos, whose previous credits include ``Zoot Suit,'' and an Emmy
Award-winning role as Lt. Castillo on the TV series ``Miami Vice,''
is quietly charismatic as a teacher capable of sparring with and
inspiring a class of tough Hispanic youngsters _ the sort of kids
current fashion holds should be ranted at with bullhorns, or
expelled.
   Lou Diamond Phillips, appealing though a bit goody-goody as the
late rock sensation Richie Valens in ``La Bamba,'' gives a more
complex performance this time around as a wonderfully understated
Angel, a street gang member finally won over by his dedicated
teacher.
   Thanks largely to the crisp direction of Ramon Menendez, who
also co-wrote the screenplay with producer Tom Musca, it is
refreshing to see streetwise, underprivileged children presented as
something other than one-dimensional, unreachable monsters.
   Escalante wins over Angel and the others with tough humor and
personal contact. When they taunt him, he aims his retorts back
with devastating accuracy.
   ``Tough guys don't do math, they fry chicken for a living,'' he
tells one macho student.
   And he relates lessons to his students' ethnic heritage: ``It
was your ancestors, the Mayans, who first contemplated the concept
`zero.' You have math in your blood.''
   Then he gets a crazy idea: He's going to teach these kids
calculus. If they can pass the Advanced Placement calculus test
that would be an almost guaranteed ticket to college and
scholarships.
   What follows is an all-too-authentic portrayal of how a single
dedicated teacher is alone in believing that his students can make
it. He must face down skeptical parents, fellow teachers _ even
investigators from the Educational Testing Service in Princeton,
N.J.
   In the end, the students do succeed, but only after a bitter and
racist battle with test officials who simply can't accept that
barrio kids could perform so well. The school rises from disgrace
to national prominence.
   The ``dedicated-teacher-conquers-tough-kids'' plot is not new to
Hollywood. Glenn Ford faced down student Sidney Poitier in ``The
Blackboard Jungle'' in 1955, and Poitier reversed roles as the
dedicated teacher in ``To Sir With Love'' in 1967.
   ``Stand and Deliver'' far exceeds those films in authenticity
and dramatic punch. ``Stand and Deliver'' delivers.
   The Warner Bros. release is rated PG.

   Consumers have regained virtually all the
confidence they lost as a result of the October stock market crash,
according to a new survey.
   The Conference Board said Monday its Consumer Confidence Index
was 113.9 points in February, up from January's 109.9 points. The
index, which uses a 1985 base of 100, stood at 115.1 in October,
before the Oct. 19 stock collapse.
   In a separate report, the business research concern's Help
Wanted Index painted a somewhat less optimistic picture. The index,
which reflects the amount of help wanted ads in 51 major newspapers
across the nation, declined to 153 in January from 155 in December.

   Americans took out $5.42 billion more in
installment debt than they paid off in January, the biggest monthly
increase in four months and the second strong month in a row, the
government says.
   The Federal Reserve said Monday that consumer credit grew at a
seasonally adjusted rate of 10.6 percent in January, following an
increase of $3.98 billion in December, which translated to an
annual rate of 7.9 percent.
   Growth in both months was greater than the 5.9 percent rate for
all of 1987, which represents a considerable slowdown compared with
recent years. The rate was 10.5 percent in 1986.

<HEAD>Consumers' Confidence Has Snapped Back; Two Hiring Surveys
Conflict</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   New reports indicate consumers have increased their borrowing
pace and have regained nearly all the confidence they lost as a
result of the October stock market crash.
   Two other reports on the employment outlook came to seemingly
conflicting conclusions, with the Conference Board reporting
indications of lessening demand for workers and Manpower Inc. _ a
temporary employment concern _ projecting strong hiring this spring.
   In the consumer credit report, the Federal Reserve said
Americans took out $5.42 billion more in installment debt than they
paid off in January, the biggest monthly increase in four months
and the second strong month in a row.
   The Fed said consumer credit grew at a seasonally adjusted rate
of 10.6 percent in January compared to a 7.9 percent annual rate in
December and a 5.9 percent rate for all of 1987.
   Consumer credit is regarded as a reflection of trends in
consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of U.S.
economic growth.
   Consumers apparently are willing to borrow because unemployment
was down _ it hit a nine-year low of 5.7 percent in February _ and
consumer confidence is rebounding, according to David Cross, an
economist with The Futures Group, a Washington consulting firm.
   The Conference Board, in issuing its monthly Consumer Confidence
Index, said consumers have been heartened by continuing strength in
the economy.
   But the private business research organization said consumers
also may be feeling more optimistic because their paychecks are
larger because of tax cuts that took effect Jan. 1.
   The Consumer Confidence Index was 113.9 points in February, up
from January's 109.9 points and 100.8 in November, after the crash.
   The index, which uses a 1985 base of 100, stood at 115.1 in
October, before the Oct. 19 stock collapse.
   The Conference Board's Help Wanted Index painted a somewhat
pessimistic picture of the employment outlook. The index, which
reflects the amount of help wanted ads in 51 major newspapers
across the nation, declined to 153 in January from 155 in December.
   The index, which uses a 1967 base of 100, reflects changes in
demand for labor and general business conditions.
   Kenneth Goldstein, a Conference Board economist, said the drop
in the index signaled a slowdown in hiring plans by employers.
   In contrast, Manpower said a significant number of American
companies will bolster hiring this spring.
   Manpower said its Employment Outlook Survey indicated 29 percent
of respondents plan to raise employment rolls in the April-June
quarter, while 6 percent expect declines. Sixty-two percent plan no
change and 3 percent don't know, the survey stated.
   Mitchell S. Fromstein, Manpower's president, said it was the
company's strongest spring hiring forecast in four years and
suggested manufacturers in all regions of the country are unusually
buoyant about the economy.

   Crude oil futures have retreated in response to
renewed fears of OPEC price discounting.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for April
delivery of West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled at $15.37 per
42-gallon barrel on Monday, down 22 cents from Friday's close of
$15.59.
   Among refined products, the April contract for wholesale No. 2
heating oil slid 0.13 cent to 43.41 cents. Wholesale unleaded
gasoline fell 0.57 cent to 43.94 cents a gallon.
   ``I think the catalyst behind today's decline is additional
rumors about OPEC individual nations offering discounts to
customers,'' said William Byers, an oil analyst with Bear, Stearns
& Co.
   Byers said the rumors of price discounting by members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries partly grew out of
reports that a delegation from the United Arab Emirates was
visiting Tokyo this week.
   ``The rumors are really all over the map,'' he said.
   Reports that OPEC might push for more production controls helped
boost prices on Friday.

<HEAD>High Court Ruling May Profoundly Affect Company Behavior,
Shareholder Suits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new Supreme Court ruling regarding when
companies must disclose merger discussions could lead to fewer
mergers and hinder corporate competitiveness, according to some
legal experts.
   In the same ruling handed down Monday, the court affirmed for
the first time a key legal theory strengthening shareholder ability
to sue a company for fraud. Approval of the so-called
fraud-on-the-market theory could spawn a wave of new lawsuits by
disgruntled shareholders, lawyers speculated.
   The ruling stemmed from a case that attracted enormous attention
because it raised questions about a company's legal
responsibilities regarding disclosure of information that could
affect its stock price, including preliminary merger negotiations
with another company.
   The case was considered especially significant because of the
wave of mergers that have reshaped corporate America over the past
several years. The ability of a company's management to negotiate
quickly and discreetly before disclosing a merger proposal has
played a key role in that trend.
   ``From a company's point of view, the Supreme Court's ruling
certainly is going to make life more difficult,'' said John F.
Olson, a prominent Washington securities lawyer at the firm of
Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. ``It will make companies a lot more
cautious about what they say publicly. You're going to see a lot
more `no comments.'''
   Advocates of disclosing merger talks, including the Securities
and Exchange Commission, argue that such information is vital to
the efficiency and integrity of the financial markets, as reflected
by a company's stock price.
   Opponents, including many corporate executives, argue that
premature disclosure of merger talks can artificially inflate stock
prices, cause a deal to collapse and alert potentially hostile
acquirers to a hitherto unknown buyout opportunity.
   The Supreme Court's ruling concerned Basic Inc., a
Cleveland-based concern that merged with another company in 1978
after its executives denied for months that merger talks were under
way.
   Some shareholders who had sold their stock prior to the merger
sued the company for fraud, contending its denials of talks had
deflated the price. If they had known about the talks, the
shareholders argued, they wouldn't have sold.
   Basic executives contended they weren't obligated to disclose
the merger talks until they had reached a fundamental agreement.
   The Supreme Court rejected both sides' arguments and ordered a
separate test for when a company must disclose merger talks. That
test measures the probability of whether a merger will occur and
must be considered on a case-by-case basis, the court said.
   Attorneys said it was difficult to predict the ultimate
consequences of the court's ruling but agreed it could pose serious
new problems, particularly in defining the probability of a merger.
   ``It's vague in the sense it makes life very difficult,'' said
William Golub, an attorney for the New York firm of Rosenman &
Colin, which represented Basic.
   ``At what point does someone decide a merger is probable? the
consequence is you either have to say everything, or else you can
say `no comment,''' he said.
   ``If the chief executives of two companies talk about a merger
on the golf course, that doesn't necessarily mean it's probable.
But if the issue has to be resolved 10 years later by a jury, it
may decide yes, that golf-course meeting was the point of
probability,'' Golub said.
   Carl Liggio, a New York securities lawyer who filed a legal
brief on behalf of the defendants, said the high court's ruling
could hurt companies and their shareholders.
   ``The problem is that when you put businesses in a fishbowl, as
you do with hindsight standards of materiality and disclosure, it
makes them less competitive,'' Liggio said. ``It's more difficult
for them to conduct business.''
   Of possibly more significance, some attorneys said, was the
court's endorsement of the fraud-on-the-market theory, which holds
that stockholders rely on the the presumed honesty of the market to
set a fair price.
   Under this theory, stockholders can sue a company for damages by
proving they bought or sold during a time in which the company gave
false information or withheld news from the market that would have
affected its stock price.
   Although lower courts generally have accepted the theory since
its inception in the mid-1970s, this was the first time the high
court sanctioned its validity.
   ``This is more significant in terms of exposure to litigation,''
Golub said. ``It just means this type of lawsuit will continue to
grow.''

<BYLINE>Icahn Will Support Texaco Reorganization Plan</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN C. GIVEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Takeover strategist Carl C. Icahn says he will
keep pressuring Texaco Inc. to put itself up for sale, but also
will support the company's plan for emerging from bankruptcy
reorganization.
   Icahn, Texaco's largest shareholder, said Monday he would drop
his attempt to win five seats on Texaco's board of directors if the
oil giant voluntarily puts itself up for sale at $55 a share.
   ``I'm not looking to run Texaco. I am looking to enhance all
shareholders' value,'' said Icahn, who owns 14.8 percent of
Texaco's stock.
   Icahn is believed to have purchased his stake at prices
averaging in the mid- to high- $30 per share range. The stock
closed Monday at $44.37{, unchanged from Friday.
   Icahn met with reporters Monday after appearing before a closed
meeting of the Council of Institutional Investors, which includes
representatives of more than 50 pension funds.
   Among others appearing before the group was Texaco's president,
James W. Kinnear, who said takeover talk stirred by the activities
of Icahn and others was hampering the company's efforts to
restructure itself and prepare for its emergence from Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection.
   Kinnear said Texaco is continuing its efforts to sell
unprofitable assets and negotiate partnership agreements on other
properties. In addition, the company is seeking short-term loans to
help pay creditors when it emerges from bankruptcy protection,
which it expects to do in April.
   ``We have found that as we go to these negotiations and go to
get bank loans, the very presence of corporate raiders makes it
very difficult to get the job done,'' Kinnear said. ``The banks are
terrified. The co-venture partners are concerned.''
   Icahn said the ``real problem'' was that Texaco's management was
not sufficiently accountable to its shareholders.
   He said he would vote for the reorganization plan ``because
that's what the shareholders want.'' But he reiterated his
dissatisfaction with what he called Texaco's ``take-it-or-leave-it
plan _ which shareholders must accept or see the company blown up.''
   The White Plains, N.Y.-based company filed for bankruptcy court
protection last April to avoid having to post a potentially ruinous
bond while appealing a $10.3 billion judgment held against it by
Pennzoil Co.
   A Houston jury awarded the judgment to Pennzoil in 1985 after
finding Texaco interfered with Pennzoil's 1984 attempt to acquire
part of Getty Oil Co., which Texaco later acquired itself.
   Texaco's shareholders have until March 21 to vote on a
reorganization plan that would bring the company out of bankruptcy
protection and pay a $3 billion out-of-court settlement with
Pennzoil.
   Earlier this year, Icahn failed to win permission from
Bankruptcy Court Judge Howard Schwartzberg on a separate plan that
was basically the same but would have stripped away Texaco's
takeover defenses.
   Icahn later said he would run a slate of five candidates _
including himself _ when the seats come up for a vote at the next
Texaco annual meeting, expected to take place in May.
   He has gained the support of another noted takeover strategist,
T. Boone Pickens, also has accumulated Texaco shares.
   Icahn said Monday he wanted the board seats so he could push his
efforts to persuade other board members sell the company
voluntarily.
   ``If you want to see friendly bids, you'll see plenty. If
hostile, I have no idea. (But) if bids start at $55 and if they
couldn't get that _ if it couldn't be done in a friendly basis _
I'll agree I was wrong and I'll withdraw my slate,'' he said.
   Wilbur Ross, an adviser to Texaco's shareholders bankruptcy
committee, who also appeared at the meeting, predicted the
reorganization plan would be approved overwhelmingly.
   ``The mail we've gotten (from small investors) has been running
nine or 10 to one in favor,'' he said. ``I don't know of any
institutions not in favor _ and the institutions own 40-to-50
percent of the stock.''

<HEAD>Bidders Trying To Undo Three Merger Agreements</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Potential buyers from Italy, Canada and the
United States are setting their sights on several corporate
targets, apparently undaunted by merger agreements that the
managements of those targets have reached with other suitors.
   The moves by General Electric Co., Italy's Pirelli Societe
Generale SA and Canada's Campeau Corp. are somewhat reminiscent of
Texaco Inc.'s ill-fated purchase of Getty Oil Co. in 1984.
   Texaco has been in federal bankruptcy court since last April,
where it sought refuge rather than post a potentially ruinous bond
of more than $10 billion to appeal a Texas court's ruling that it
illegally had interfered in an agreement by Pennzoil Co. to buy
part of Getty.
   ``In the past, you fought tooth and nail up to when the company
accepted a bid, and once a company accepted a bid it was on to the
next game,'' said Daniel Schwartz, managing director of Ulmer
Brothers Inc., a merchant banking firm that specializes in mergers
and acquisitions.
   ``But clearly that doesn't seem to be the rule anymore,'' he
said.
   GE and Pirelli announced their offers Monday, while Campeau took
action last week.
   The new bidders feel they are on solid legal ground. They all
are appealing directly to shareholders of the target companies
instead of asking the companies' directors to back out of any
agreements.
   Texaco got in trouble because Getty was privately-owned, so for
Texaco to take it over it had to get the Getty directors to back
out of their deal with Pennzoil. Texaco argues that Getty's deal
with Pennzoil was not legally binding, but has reached a tentative
$3 billion out-of-court settlement of the dispute.
   The new offers include these deals:
   _Pirelli offered $1.86 billion for Firestone Tire & Rubber Co.
on Monday even though Firestone agreed last month to combine its
core tire-making operations with those of Japan's Bridgestone Corp.
in a joint venture. Pirelli said its offer was contingent on
Firestone calling off its deal with Bridgestone.
   _General Electric, making what it called its first unsolicited
takeover bid, offered $423 million Monday for Roper Corp., even
though the Augusta, Ga.-based appliance maker has agreed to be
acquired by Whirlpool Corp. for $352.5 million.
   _Campeau Corp., the Canadian retailing giant, is pressing its
months-long pursuit of Cincinnati-based Federated Department Stores
Inc., despite Federated's definitive agreement last week to be
acquired by R.H. Macy & Co. for $6.1 billion. Campeau has an
outstanding $6.18 billion offer.
   Because of Texaco's experience, ``Lawyers and their clients are
much more careful to not put themselves in a position where someone
could claim interference with someone else's agreement,'' said
Klaus Eppler, a partner in the law firm of Proskauer Rose Goetz &
Mendelsohn.
   By going straight to the shareholders, the bidders cannot be
accused of asking the directors to renege on previous agreements,
Eppler said.
   The three offers signify that deals actually are not complete
until a buyer's tender offer expires and the acquiring company can
actually buy the shares.
   ``I'm somewhat at a loss as to why all of a sudden this type of
behavior is now acceptable,'' Schwartz said.
   ``It used to be when you had a done deal, you didn't have people
coming in with tender offers. But you've got three of them right
here,'' he said.
   But although the flurry of such deals may be unusual, buyers and
sellers typically make arrangements for such eventualities. For
example, Macy's agreement to buy Federated requires Federated to
pay up $45 million in so-called ``breakup fees'' to Macy in the
event their deal falls through under certain circumstances.
   Such provisions typically are aimed at discouraging other
bidders from making a play for a company that has agreed to be
bought out by someone else.

<HEAD>Mobil Selling Montgomery Ward for $3.8 Billion to Management Group</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIO FOX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A planned management-led buyout of Montgomery
Ward & Co. will close Mobil Corp.'s ill-fated venture into
retailing, while giving the venerable retailer a chance to reap all
the benefits of its recent successes.
   Montgomery Ward said Monday that an investor group led by
president and chief executive Bernard Brennan would acquire the
company from Mobil in a $3.8 billion leveraged buyout.
   The group, which also includes General Electric Capital Corp.,
will pay more than $1.5 billion in cash for the 115-year-old,
Chicago-based company and assume $2.3 billion of its debt.
   ``This is a historic day for Montgomery Ward,'' Brennan told a
news conference. ``We've gone through an awful lot over the years.
``In 1987, we earned $130 million after taxes. In 1980, we had $162
million loss after taxes.''
   Faced with a financial drain from the retailer during the early
1980s, Mobil _ which acquired Montgomery Ward in 1976 for about $1
billion _ has wanted to sell the chain for some time. Brennan,
credited with turning the retailer around in recent years, had been
negotiating for months to acquire the company.
   ``It's a business that we don't know too well,'' said Mobil
chairman Allen E. Murray. He also said New York-based Mobil, the
nation's second-largest oil company, believed it would be best to
concentrate on its core businesses.
   Murray said in a telephone interview Monday that Mobil began
receiving inquiries about Montgomery Ward last summer, but declined
to identify the other parties interested in buying the retailer.
   Mobil stock rose $1.12{ to $44.75 in New York Stock Exchange
trading on Monday.
   Brennan said GE Capital, a unit of General Electric Co., will
take over Ward's credit-card operation.
   In a leveraged buyout, investors borrow heavily to buy out a
company and then pay off the debt with the target company's cash
flow or the sale of its assets.
   But Brennan said the company has no plans to sell other assets
or to lay off any employees under the buyout plan, which takes
effect in 60 days.
   ``We see no need at this time to reduce employment. For example,
in Chicago, we've added 300 jobs in the last six months,'' Brennan
said.
   ``This is not a leveraged buyout that says, `Let's shrink the
company.'''
   During its comeback effort, Montgomery Ward laid off 17,000
employees, closed its Jefferson Ward discount stores and other
unprofitable branches, and shut down the catalog division that
dated back to the company's early days.
   It moved into specialty retailing, opening appliance and
electronics stores, and is converting its department stores to
emphasize specialty formats including electronics, home furnishings
and recreational items.
   Last month, Montgomery Ward announced it was realigning its
field-office management to create new specialty retailing positions.
   ``Our customers are middle America. We don't want to be too
avant garde, and we don't want to be downscale.'' said Brennan, a
former executive of Chicago-based Sears, Roebuck and Co.
   ``Consumers have the advantage that we have people running the
business that owns the business,'' Brennan said. ``Independence
gives us much more flexibility.''
   Mobil has not indicated what it would do with the money from the
sale. Energy analyst Bruce Lazier, of the investment firm Prescott,
Ball & Turben, said he believed corporate capital investment will
receive the largest share.
   ``My guess is that, that will reduce their short-term debt and
that gives them an extra $2 billion of funds available number one
for reinvestment in capital expenditures if the opportunities arise
and, number two, gives them flexibility to increase dividends and
share repurchase plans,'' Lazier said in a telephone interview.

<TEXT>
   Martin L. Longstreth Jr., who worked his way
up from clerk to chairman of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, has
died of cancer. He was 42.
   Longstreth died in his home Sunday, just 2{ months after he was
diagnosed as having cancer, his family said.
   The stock exchange board will name a successor within several
months, President Nick Giordano said Monday.
   After graduating from Villanova University in 1967 with a
bachelor of science degree, Longstreth spent two years in an
executive training program with a Philadelphia bank before entering
the securities business.
   He spent a year in the retail end of the business before
becoming a clerk on the floor of the Philadelphia exchange.
   Longstreth worked as an options special and floor broker from
1972 to 1980. He served as senior vice president of the
Philadelphia Stock Exchange from 1974-75, in charge of floor
surveillance for equities and options. He was named chairman of the
exchange in March 1984.
   He is survived by his wife, Francis, and nine children.

<HEAD>Gillette Mails Annual Meeting Proxy Statement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN MURPHY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gillette Co. is urging its shareholders to reject
an attempt by a New York-based investment partnership to oust four
company directors at next month's annual meeting.
   Colman Mockler Jr., Gillette's chairman and chief operating
officer, said in a statement mailed Monday to shareholders that
Coniston Partners intended to sell or dismantle Gillette if the
hostile takeover succeeds.
   ``The principals of Coniston Group have no experience in
directing or running a worldwide manufacturing or consumer goods
company as an ongoing enterprise,'' stated Mockler. ``The board of
directors believes that the objective of Coniston Group is to force
the immediate sale or dismemberment of Gillette.''
   Coniston controls 6.76 million Gillette shares, or about 5.8
percent of the company's shares outstanding, and has indicated it
wanted the company to boost its stock price either by restructuring
or negotiating a merger with another party.
   Mockler contended the company's major restructuring in 1986, the
result of repeated takeover attempts by Revlon Group Inc., had
helped enhance shareholder values. Mockler said Gillette's earnings
per share rose a record 41 percent in 1987.
   Coniston, through two subsidiaries, is seeking to solicit a
majority of shareholders to elect four nominees to the Gillette
board at the April 21 meeting in Boston. One of the seats up for
election is Mockler's.
   Gillette shares rose 12{ cents to close at $40.75 Monday on New
York Stock Exchange trading.
   Gus Oliver, a principal of Coniston Partners, said letters
explaining the group's proposal should be mailed to shareholders
later this week.
   Monday was the final day for shareholders to qualify to vote at
the annual meeting.
   Gillette underwent a major restructuring after rebuffing a third
hostile takeover bid by Revlon, which agreed not to seek to gain
control of Gillette under a 10-year pact signed in November 1986.
   Following the accord, Gillette laid off about 2,400 workers and
sold off a several sudsidiaries and discontinued unprofitable
divisions, including a line of high-quality writing instruments and
28 percent interest in Eye World stores.
   Gillette spokesman David Fausch said further cutbacks in some
international operations, such as cosmetics and beauty aids, are
planned as part of the restructuring.
   Coniston last year was instrumental in forcing a major
restructuring of Allegis Corp., the parent of United Airlines.
   Separately on Monday, Gillette said it had received notification
that New York real estate developer Donald Trump had received
Federal Trade Commission clearance to increase his holdings of the
company's stock.
   Trump now may purchase up to 24.9 percent of Gillette's stock.
Trump owns about 400,000 shares, which was less than three-tenths
of 1 percent of Gillette's 115 million common shares outstanding.
   A Gillette statement Monday said the company has not received
any communications from Trump.

   A financial restructuring of Shoney's
Inc. means $730 million for stockholders who will receive one-time
dividends of $20 in cash and stock for each of their Shoney's
shares, officials said.
   ``This is not giving up, this is a fresh start,'' according to
Mitchell Boyd, vice chairman and chief executive officer of the
Nashville-based restaurant chain.
   Financing of the recapitalization will be through cash and about
$600 million in bank borrowings through a syndicate headed by the
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Boyd said Sunday.
   Shareholders will receive $16 per share in cash and a
subordinated debenture with a face value of $4 for each share of
Shoney's stock they own, and will retain ownership of the stock.
   Shareholders will not receive dividends but will receive
interest of 48 cents on each note, compared to the 18 cents per
share dividends received last year.
   Company chairman Ray Danner, who started the 1,400-restaurant
chain in 1959, stands to receive about $110 million in cash for his
6.9 million shares. Retired senior chairman Alex Schoenbaum,
founder of the concept, owns about 3.2 million shares and would
receive about $51 million.
   The two own 28 percent of the outstanding stock of Shoney's,
which had revenue last year of $694 million.
   Shareholder approval is not required for the plan, but the board
of directors decided Sunday to submit the proposal to shareholders
because of its massive scope.
   The recapitalization plan is designed to shift the company's
emphasis from growth through physical expansion to growth through
improved profit margins at existing locations, Boyd said.
   The plan will also allow the founders to cash out, while leaving
them as major owners of the stock for the next few years, and
provide incentives to the second generation of top management, Boyd
said.
   The plan permits executives to immediately cash in all
outstanding stock options and would set aside an additional 1
million shares for management stock options over the next several
years, allowing management to own up to 17 percent of the company.

<HEAD>De la Madrid Urges Continued Fight Against Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Miguel de la Madrid urged producers
and businesses to hold down prices this month, saying it ``will be
decisive for the success'' of his anti-inflation program.
   ``Our goal is not only to reduce inflation in March, but to
continue dominating this harmful phenomenon the rest of the year,''
the president said Monday in a speech broadcast nationwide over
radio and television.
   De la Madrid said his program, called the Economic Solidarity
Pact, had brought down inflation, allowed for a budget surplus and
reduced government use of public credit, bringing down interest
rates.
   Inflation for February is expected to be about 8 percent, or
about half the 15.5 percent registered in January, he said.
Consumer prices rose 8.7 percent in the first half of February and
inflation was a record 159.2 percent in 1987.
   ``Today I can affirm with satisfaction that the basic
commitments of the pact are being fulfilled by ... workers,
businessmen and the government,'' he said.
   He said the government had increased its income while cutting
spending through reinforced austerity measures.
   The budget surplus, not counting debt service payments, meant
the government used less public credit and lightened pressure on
interest rates, he said.
   The minimal variation in the value of the peso currency against
the dollar from December 15 to February 21 also helped reduce
inflation, he said.
   The peso stood Monday at 2,330 to the dollar on the free market,
compared with 2,286 a month ago. The rate is used for tourism and
most border transactions. A second rate, the controlled rate, used
for 75 percent of all transactions, closed at 2,241 to the dollar,
compared with 2,205 a month ago.
   With the start of the second phase of the plan March 1, Treasury
Secretary Gustavo Petricioli announced that both rates, which had
been sliding against the dollar, would remain unchanged this month.
   Prices of government price-controlled items, which include
gasoline, electricity and basic foods, were frozen for the month
and a wage increase for the month held to 3 percent, below what had
been expected.
   The minimum wage rose March 1 to 8,000 pesos a day or about
$3.50.
   Budget Secretary Pedro Aspe told a meeting of state financial
officials on Sunday that the stabilization of the economy now was
``within reach.''
   Letting up on the inflation fight, he said, would mean a
reversal of the gains achieved so far.
   Aspe told the state financial officials that the government's
program did not constitute a ``shock'' plan, the name given to
drastic measures taken by Brazil and Argentina to rid their
economies of hyper-inflation.
   Mexico's plan, he said, does not include a ``generalized control
of prices and salaries'' such as other countries have imposed.

<HEAD>Judge Extends Detention Order Two Days for Mulheren</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge will decide after reviewing a
psychiatrist's report whether an arbitrageur accused of plotting to
kill convicted stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky should be turned
over to a psychiatric facility in New Jersey.
   U.S. District Judge Whitman Knapp extended an order Monday
placing John A. Mulheren in Manhattan's Metropolitan Correctional
Center, a federal detention facility, until Wednesday, when Knapp
is to examine the report of the psychiatrist, Dr. Naomi Goldstein.
   Detention hearings were being held to determine if Mulheren
should be released on bail, held by federal authorities or turned
over to a psychiatric facility recommended by his attorneys.
   Late Saturday, U.S. District Judge Pierre Leval ordered Mulheren
to remain at the MCC after federal Magistrate Kathleen A. Roberts
ordered earlier in the day that Mulheren be released to the Carrier
Foundation in New Jersey.
   The government had argued that the New Jersey facility was not
secure enough to hold Mulheren, senior partner at Jamie Securities
Co.
   Mulheren, 38, of Rumson, N.J., was detained Feb. 18 on a federal
criminal complaint that he threatened to kill Boesky, a central
figure in the government's investigation of insider trading on Wall
Street, and Michael Davidoff, Boesky's former head trader.
   According to police reports, Mulheren was carrying weapons and
ammunition while making threats against the men, who might be
witnesses against Mulheren.
   ``We feel he has to be in a secure facility. There's a real
possibility Mr. Mulheren will get out and do it again,'' the
assistant U.S. attorney handling the case, Robert Gage, told the
court.
   Mulheren's lawyers argue that he is a manic-depressive who had
failed on the day of his arrest to take Lithium, a drug prescribed
to control extreme mood swings and impulses.
   At the hearing, they presented testimony from the arresting
police officers who had grown up with Mulheren and other testimony
that indicated Mulheren was a model citizen and not a threat to
society.
   Defense attorneys also said they were concerned about Mulheren's
health and wanted him where he could receive better care.
   Knapp initially appeared to be against having Mulheren examined
by a psychiatrist. But he later changed his mind and ruled that
Mulheren should be examined by Goldstein, a Manhattan psychiatrist
with whom Knapp is familiar and whom the government had suggested.
   Goldstein will be allowed to review Mulheren's records and
interview his attorneys and wife. However, Knapp stipulated that
information from the psychiatrist would not be used in a court
unless the trial judge so ordered. Information from the wife was
not to be used in court at all.
   At the 2 p.m. hearing Wednesday, Knapp will review the initial
impressions of Goldstein about Mulheren's behavior potential and
decide whether to send the case back to Roberts or send the
defendant to the New Jersey facility.

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge says he'll order new delegate
elections at 68 United Auto Workers local unions in the Southwest
following reports of irregulatites in the campaign and election.
   U.S. District Judge Richard Suhrheinrich said Monday new
elections will be ordered in the contested 1986 race between
incumbent UAW Region 5 Director Kenneth Worley and his top
assistant, Jerry Tucker.
   Tucker was fired after he announced in May 1986 that he was
entering the race against Worley. Tucker lost by two-tenths of a
vote, but nearly 27 votes in the contest were challenged.
   The U.S. Department of Labor investigated the election and filed
three lawsuits against the UAW, charging that some illegal
delegates voted in the August election, that Tucker was fired
illegally and that Worley illegally used union money for an
individual campaign.
   Worley spent $13,000 in union money to buy jackets for delegates
to the UAW's constitutional convention in August 1986, where they
voted for regional directors and other union officers. The jackets
bore the region's number and Worley's name.
   Members in other regions bought their own jackets, as did
Tucker's Region 5 supporters, said Tucker's attorney, Joseph
Yablonski.
   The Labor Department investigation also found that Worley sent
out campaign fliers typed on a UAW typewriter on UAW stationary in
a UAW office, which also is illegal for an individual's campaign,
said Labor Department attorney Janet Graney.
   The UAW declined comment until it receives the order.
   The order, requiring new delegate elections in the eight-state
region, would end at least part of a 21-month legal battle by
Tucker and the Labor Department.
   Region 5 includes UAW locals in Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma,
Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Colorado and New Mexico. After new
delegates are elected for each local, they will vote at a
mini-convention for a regional director.

<TEXT>
   Frank Perdue, the 67-year-old head of
Perdue Farms Inc., is stepping down from his post, but says he will
remain directly involved in managing the large poultry company.
   Donald W. Mabe, a 30-year veteran of the company who most
recently served as vice chairman and president, has replaced Perdue
as president and chief executive officer, according to a company
statement.
   The change will relieve Perdue, associated by many television
commercial watchers with his motto, ``It takes a tough man to make
a tender chicken,'' from many day-to-day executive duties, the firm
said late last week. But he plans to work directly with Mabe.
   In other appointments, Perdue's son, James A. Perdue, vice
president of the company's quality improvement division, was named
to the chairman's committee, the top policy-making body, and Pelham
B. Lawrence, vice president and chief financial officer, was
elected to the board of directors.
   Mabe, who joined Perdue in 1957 as a broiler service supervisor,
has been broiler marketing specialist, director of broiler sales
and service, director of the hatching-egg program and production
manager of the firm. In 1967 he was named vice president and
general manager of processing and in 1972 he was appointed
executive vice president of the company. Elected to the board of
directors in 1963, he was named president in 1979 and vice chairman
in 1984.
   James Perdue joined the family business in 1983 as a management
trainee. He has served as a foreman, quality control coordinator
and plant manager in Salisbury, as well as quality control manager
for the company's Delmarva operations. He was named vice president
of quality improvement in 1987 and has been on the board of
directors since 1979.

   Philadelphia Electric Co. chairman James L.
Everett III is retiring and will be replaced by Joseph F. Paquette
Jr., a former Philadelphia Electric executive who is currently
president of a Michigan utility.
   The changes, announced by Philadelphia Electric on Monday, came

   Everett, 61, said Monday he would retire at Philadelphia
Electric's April 13 board meeting, when Paquette is to be elected
his successor. Paquette will serve as Philadelphia Electric's
president until Everett's retirement.
   Everett will remain on the utility's board as chairman of the
executive committee.
   Paquette, 53 is president and chief operating officer of CMS
Energy Corp., the Jackson, Mich.-based parent of Consumers Power in
Jackson, Mich. He previously spent 30 years at Philadelphia
Electric and held a number of management positions.
   Everett's job had been in jeopardy since the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission decided last March 31 to close the Peach Bottom plant
after control room operators were found sleeping and playing video
games on the job.
   His pending retirement follows the departure last month of
Philadelphia Electric president John H. Austin.
   William Shane, chairman of the Pennsylvania Public Utility
Commission, had called for Everett's resignation. He said Monday he
was delighted with the latest changes.
   The utility also announced Monday that Corbin A. McNeill Jr.
will become its executive vice president for nuclear operations
next week. McNeill, 48, will be responsible for directing the
company's nuclear operations, including the nuclear department's
reorganization and efforts to get NRC approval to restart the York
County power plant.
   Philadelphia Electric must assure the NRC that it can operate
the plant safely before the agency will allow Peach Bottom's two
reactors to restart.
   Philadelphia Electric submitted part of a new restart plan on
Nov. 25, outlining management changes at Peach Bottom and at the
Limerick nuclear plant in Montgomery County. On Feb. 12,
Philadelphia Electric submitted the second half.
   In the plan, the company promised to provide more and
better-trained plant operators, a new management team at the plant
and a better employee value system.
   The NRC has found a list of deficiencies in the plant's
operations, including the release of mildly radioactive water into
the Susquehanna River, misclassification of radioactive waste
shipment and poor implementation of fire requirements.
   The shutdown is costing Philadelphia Electric and its three
partners in the plant about $14 million a month to buy replacement
power.
   Peach Bottom was opened in 1974 and is owned by Philadelphia
Electric, Public Servcie Electric & Gas Co., of Newark, N.J.;
Atlantic Electric Co., of Atlantic City, N.J.; and Delmarva Power &
Light Co., of Wilmington, Del.

   General Electric Co.'s unsolicited bid to
acquire appliance-maker Roper Corp. _ which already has agreed to a
merger with rival Whirlpool Corp. _ is seen as a competitive move
in a consolidating industry.
   GE on Monday offered to pay $45 a share, or $423 million, for
Roper's 9.4 million common shares outstanding.
   The unsolicited offer _ the first ever by GE _ topped the
Whirlpool offer of $37.50 a share, or $352.5 million, agreed to
last month by Roper.
   Analysts applauded the move by GE, the well-known appliance
maker which also has major interests in finance, broadcasting and
other manufacturing, which was seen as a thrust against a
competitor in the major appliance field.
   ``It makes sense and the numbers look real good,'' said Nicholas
Heymann, a vice president of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New
York. ``In terms of what they're getting, they're trying to make a
statement with the price.''
   Roper's stock soared $11 to $48.37{ a share in composite New
York Stock Exchange trading Monday, indicating that speculators
expected a higher offer to emerge. GE fell 75 cents a share to
$43.37{ and Whirlpool dropped 62{ cents a share to $28.75.
   Roper, which is based in Augusta, Ga., makes gas and electric
ranges, including some of the ranges marketed by GE.
   Heymann said GE had carved out a niche in the gas range market
within the past three years, and was No. 3 in that business with 15
percent of the market.
   ``This year they are revamping the range line and I think they
would like to be vertically integrated in the gas line,'' Heymann
said. ``If they expand, they could vertically integrate and could
move up to 20 or 25 percent of the market.''
   ``It appears the ball is back in Whirlpool's court,'' Heymann
said.
   Roper, based in Augusta, Ga., said today it would meet with GE
representatives and give the company information it had requested.
Roper said it would inform its shareholders of the board's position
on the GE offer on or before March 18.
   Whirlpool expects to received the detailed GE offer today, said
Donna McLean, a spokeswoman for Benton Harbor, Mich.-based
Whirlpool.
   ``Right now, we're right where we were. We have not said we're
going to up the ante at all,'' McLean said.
   In a statement Monday, David Whitwam, Whirlpool's chairman,
president and chief executive officer, said the company was still
committed to acquiring Roper as a major step in its growth strategy.
   Russ Leavitt, a senior analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc. in New
York, said the merger attempt gives GE a ``potentially strengthened
position in the cooking business.''
   ``It also gives them an entree to Sears, which is a major
appliance retailer where GE has not been involved,'' Leavitt said,
referring to Sears, Roebuck & Co. ``Roper is a Sears supplier of
cooking products and in the past GE has sold very little to Sears.
It could help them get into that market.''
   GE said it made the offer after learning from a Securities and
Exchange Commission filing that Roper agreed to the Whirlpool
merger under threat of a ``unilateral takeover.''
   GE said that in discussions with Roper management last year,
Roper officials said they wanted the company to remain independent.
   ``We concluded that because we approached Roper on a friendly
basis and because Roper had been forced into play by the Whirlpool
offer, we should make an offer,'' said Jack Batty, a spokesman for
GE. ``We would describe our offer as competitive.''
   Batty also noted the industry consolidation stemming from
stepped up competition. Other major appliance mergers in recent
years included Maytag Corp.'s acquisition of Magic Chef Co. and the
acquisition of White Consolidated Industries by Sweden's Electrolux
AB.
   ``We feel that it would significantly strengthen GE's appliance
business in an increasingly competitive global market,'' Batty
said. ``We became impressed with the quality of their products.
...We think it would enhance our competitive position.''
   GE's tender offer expires April 1. Whirlpool's offer expires
March 25.
   In its fiscal year ended last July 31, Roper had net income of
$24 million on $703 million in sales. Gas and electric ranges
account for about 40 percent of sales.
   GE had 1987 revenue of $40.5 billion and net income of $2.9
billion. GE's major appliance business last year had a pretax
operating profit of $490 million on $4.72 billion in revenue.

   Frank Perdue, the 67-year-old head of
Perdue Farms Inc., is stepping down from his post, but says he will
remain directly involved in managing the large poultry company.
   Donald W. Mabe, a 30-year veteran of the company who most
recently served as vice chairman and president, has replaced Perdue
as president and chief executive officer, according to a company
statement.
   The change will relieve Perdue, associated by many television
commercial watchers with his motto, ``It takes a tough man to make
a tender chicken,'' from many day-to-day executive duties, the firm
said late last week. But he plans to work directly with Mabe.
   In other appointments, Perdue's son, James A. Perdue, vice
president of the company's quality improvement division, was named
to the chairman's committee, the top policy-making body, and Pelham
B. Lawrence, vice president and chief financial officer, was
elected to the board of directors.
   Mabe, who joined Perdue in 1957 as a broiler service supervisor,
has been broiler marketing specialist, director of broiler sales
and service, director of the hatching-egg program and production
manager of the firm. In 1967 he was named vice president and
general manager of processing and in 1972 he was appointed
executive vice president of the company. Elected to the board of
directors in 1963, he was named president in 1979 and vice chairman
in 1984.
   James Perdue joined the family business in 1983 as a management
trainee. He has served as a foreman, quality control coordinator
and plant manager in Salisbury, as well as quality control manager
for the company's Delmarva operations. He was named vice president
of quality improvement in 1987 and has been on the board of
directors since 1979.

   Stocks rose today in active trading, influenced
by dividend-related buying and selling strategies.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 13.09 points
to 2,069.46 by 11 a.m. EST.
   Among broader market barometers, the New York Stock Exchange's
composite index measuring all listed issues rose 0.76 to 151.29.
The American Stock Exchange's market value index rose 1.07 to
295.21.
   Wall Street analysts said the market's strength was a good sign
that reflected a desire by institutional investment managers to put
unused money to work before the end of the first quarter March 31.
   ``The one thing insitutions want to avoid is lack of performance
at end of a quarter,'' said Philip C. Puccio, manager of
institutional trading at Dillon Read & Co. in New York.
   Gaining issues outnumbered losers by nearly 3-to-1 on the NYSE,
with 922 up, 384 down and 471 unchanged. Volume on the Big Board
totaled 86.55 million shares after the first 90 minutes of trading.
   Nearly a third of that volume came from trading in stocks that
carry dividend yields of at least 9 percent: Chemical New York,
Detroit Editson, Pacific Gas & Electric and McDermott International.
   Investors who buy Detroit Edison's stock before Thursday will
capture the right to receive the next quarterly dividend payment.
The deadline to capture the dividend in the other three issues
expires today.
   On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 1.49 to
2,056.37.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 6 to 5 on the

   A subsidiary of R.H. Macy & Co. Inc. launched
a cash tender offer today to buy 80 percent of Federated Department
Stores Inc., which remains the target of a competing buyout offer
from Campeau Corp.
   A wholly-owned Macy subsidiary, FDS Acquisition Corp., commenced
the cash tender offer at a price of $74.50 per share for up to
70.43 million shares, or approximately 80 percent, of Federated
common stock. Macy plans to swap shares in the merged company
Macy's-Federated Inc. for the remaining 20 percent of Federated
stock.
   Analysts have estimated the total value of the Macy offer at
$6.1 billion.
   The tender offer is proceeding under a definitive agreement
signed by Federated and Macy last week.
   Toronto-based Campeau is offering $75 per share for 80 percent
of Federated's stock and $44 per share for the remaining stock. The
Campeau offer, which has a blended value of $68 per share, totals
$6.18 billion.
   Campeau's offer expires at midnight March 15, while the Macy
offer expires April 4.
   Federated stock was unchanged at $66.62{ at midday today on the
New York Stock Exchange.

   Hundreds of scientists plan to gather Wednesday
to help design a $456 million machine that will generate the most
intense X-ray beams in the world, the laboratory's director says.
   The scientists, who are coming from some of the nation's major
industries and universities, will gather at Argonne National
Laboratory near suburban Lemont.
   Alan Schriesheim, Argonne's director, said President Reagan
allotted $12.6 million in his proposed fiscal 1989 budget to the
research, development and construction at Argonne of the machine _
called a synchroton.
   Congress has not yet passed the funding for the project. But
Schriesheim said he is optimistic lawmakers will approve the
funding because of the synchroton's ``extraordinary variety'' of
applications in pure science and industry.
   The machine would produce the most intense and powerful X-ray
beams ever generated and will be used to help scientists explain
the interior of matter, Schriesheim said in a telephone interview
Monday night.
   Industry has taken a keen interest in the development of the
machine, named the 7GeV Advanced Photon Source.
   ``The machine has already attracted more industrial
participation in the planning and design stages than any basic
research machine ever built in the country,'' said David Baurac, an
Argonne spokesman.
   Some of the 7GeV Advanced Photon Source's applications would be
in the petroleum, bio-medical, semiconductor, computer and airplane
industries, Schriesheim said.
   Future applications might include the creation of a plastic
stronger than steel, faster computer chips and improved diagnosis
of heart disease, he said.
   International Business Machines Corp of Armonk, N.Y, American
Telephone & Telegraph Co. of New York, Boeing Co. of Seattle, and
Exxon Corp. of New York are among the businesses expected to attend
the two-day meeting to help design the machine to meet their needs,
Schriesheim said.
   Three hundred scientists are expected to attend the meeting,
Baurac said.
   Argonne hopes to begin constructing the machine in late 1988 or
early 1989. The machine will take about seven years to build, and
its construction would generate 1,500 jobs, Baurac said.
   Once built, 300 scientists and technical staff members would run
the machine, and about 1,000 scientists from industry, universities
and other laboratories would use it each year, Baurac said.
   The synchroton works by taking positrons and accelerating them
almost to the speed of light. The synchroton then uses
sophisticated arrays of magnets to wiggle the beam violently to
generate ``the brightest beams of X-rays in the world'', Baurac
said.
   Positrons are ``like electrons with positive charges,'' Baurac
said.

   Grain and soybean futures prices opened mostly
higher today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Soybean futures showed the greatest strength, gaining from
follow-through buying from Monday and from a lack of farmer selling
overnight, analysts said.
   Soybeans got an additional boost from the Agriculture
Department's announcement that last week's U.S. soybean exports
totaled nearly 22 million bushels, more than the market had
expected, said Jerry Gidel, an analyst for G.H. Miller & Co. in
Chicago.
   Corn futures advanced on news that the Soviet Union had
purchased 300,000 metric tons of U.S. corn for delivery in the
current marketing year, which began Sept. 1.
   Wheat prices rose slightly in reaction to a mixed bag of news
surrounding the USDA's auction of government-owned wheat, Gidel
said.
   The positive news was that the agency had sold just 1.6 million
bushels of wheat in Friday's auction. But the USDA also said it
would continue its schedule of thrice-weekly auctions, each with a
target of 10 million bushels, through March 25.
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent to 1{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $3.05{ a bushel; corn was \ cent
to 1 cent higher with March at $2.01} a bushel; oats were } cent to
1 cent higher with March at $1.91{ a bushel; soybeans were 1\ cents
to 2{ cents higher with March at $6.15 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .20 cent to .80 cent higher with April at 72.35
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent to .73 cent higher with
March at 80.80 cents a pound; hogs were .18 cent to .60 cent higher
with April at 43.95 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .20
cent lower to .50 cent higher with March at 54.50 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures closed sharply higher on Monday.

   Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. management's
rejection of a merger with Pirelli in favor of a venture with
Bridgestone Corp. set the stage for the Italian tiremaker's $1.86
billion tender offer for Firestone, Pirelli's chief says.
   Pirelli Societe Generale SA, the world's fifth-largest tire
maker, began negotiating at Firestone's request over a merger of
their tire operations in October 1986, Pirelli chief executive
Gianbattista DiGiorgia said Monday.
   The talks broke up with no agreement last March but resumed
early last month, DiGiorgia said in a telephone interview from New
York.
   ``We had a talk with them in the beginning of February, making a
proposal that seemed to us to have been accepted,'' DiGiorgia said.
``A couple days later they announced the preliminary agreement with
Bridgestone.''
   Pirelli said its offer Monday of $58 cash a share for
Firestone's 32 million common shares outstanding was contingent on
Firestone's dropping the tentative agreement reached with
Bridgestone on Feb. 16.
   That agreement, calling for the Japanese tire manufacturer to
buy 75 percent of Firestone's tire-making business for $1.5
billion, left Pirelli ``no choice'' but to make an offer directly
to Firestone's shareholders, the Italian company said in a
statement.
   Pirelli's offer also was conditioned on Pirelli's acquiring at
least two-thirds of Firestone's shares in the tender offer and on
the removal of Firestone's anti-takeover defenses, Pirelli said.
   If Pirelli acquires control of Firestone, it will sell certain
segments of the company to French tire manufacturer Michelin.
   John J. Nevin, chairman of Chicago-based Firestone, stated late
Monday that the company's board was reviewing the offer and asking
shareholders to await its recommendation before deciding whether to
tender their stock to Pirelli.
   The board will complete its review by March 18, Nevin said.
   Firestone stock shot up $13.50 a share to $63.12{ in composite
New York Stock Exchange trading Monday, topping Pirelli's
$58-a-share offer in reflection of speculation that a higher offer
might emerge.
   Pirelli had been regarded as a possible suitor for Firestone,
and just before Firestone announced its Bridgestone agreement
speculation was rampant that a bid was about to be made.
   Lawyers for Pirelli on Monday went to U.S. District Court in
Cleveland to try to stop Firestone from enforcing the Ohio Takeover
Act and from using its ``poison pill'' anti-takeover measures. A
poison pill is a move by a takeover target company to make its
stock less attractive to a potential acquirer.
   Judge Alice Batchelder denied Pirelli's request for a temporary
restraining order and set a hearing for next Monday to review the
constitutionality of the Ohio takeover laws.
   Acquisition of Firestone, the world's fourth-largest tiremaker,
substantially would increase Pirelli's current 1.5 percent share of
the U.S. tire market, the world's largest. It also would give the
Italian company its first U.S. manufacturing facilities.
   ``It is known in our strategy that we need production facilities
in the States,'' DiGiorgia said.
   ``We are present in eight countries so far,'' he said. ``It can
be good for us to have a major presence in the States in order to
improve our overall presence in the marketplace.''
   Analysts said acquiring Firestone's U.S. tire business would be
the easiest way for a foreign manufacturer to establish a solid
foothold in the U.S. market and remain a contender in the fiercely
competitive global industry.
   ``Firestone is the only game in town for a tire company located
outside the United States that wants to get in in a big way,'' said
Donald DeScenza of Nomura Securities International Inc. in New York.
   ``Firestone's got the plants, the distribution system and the
relationships with General Motors, Ford and Chrysler,'' he said.
   Firestone has about 21 percent of the lucrative U.S.
original-equipment market for passenger cars, said Ed Noga, editor
of Rubber & Plastics News, an Akron, Ohio-based trade journal.
   Goodyear holds 34 percent of that market, Uniroyal 20 percent,
General 13 percent, and Michelin 11 percent, Noga said.
   Firestone ranked fourth among tiremakers worldwide in 1986 sales
of tires alone, behind Goodyear, Michelin and Bridgestone, Noga
said.
   Pirelli, based in Milan, was fifth with 1987 sales of $3.65
billion.
   Under the plan to spin off parts of Firestone to Michelin, the
French group would pay about $650 million for Firestone's Brazilian
holdings and its Master Care Inc. auto service business, Pirelli
stated.
   Michelin also would have an option to buy 50 percent of
Firestone's synthetic rubber and diversified product holdings in
the United States for about $150 million.
   On Feb. 16, Bridgestone and Firestone said they intended to form
a new Akron-based business called Firestone Tire Co. that would own
Firestone's worldwide tire-making operation.
   Bridgestone would own 75 percent of the joint venture.

<HEAD>Meeting of Non-OPEC Oil Producers Set For Wednesday</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with Norway declining to attend; no pickup</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Non-OPEC oil-producing countries are
scheduled to meet in London on Wednesday to consider ways of
stabilizing world oil prices, Egypt's top petroleum official said.
   In a statement distributed Tuesday by the state-run Middle East
News Agency, Oil Minister Abdel-Hady Kandil said Egypt called the
conference to discuss ``deteriorating conditions in the world oil
market.''
   He said conferees planned to discuss ``means of halting the
decline in prices and the best way to help producing countries,
both inside and outside OPEC, maintain a steady income.''
   Kandil said it was not known how long the meeting would last. He
also said it was not directed against the 13-member Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   Besides Egypt, participants will include the Soviet Union,
China, Norway, Angola, Malaysia, Brunei, Oman and Mexico, Kandil
said.
   In Stockholm, however, a Norwegian oil ministry spokesman was
quoted as saying that Norway had declined an invitation to attend
the meeting.
   The spokesman said Norway remained resolute in its commitment to
support OPEC in seeking stable oil prices, despite the recent
downturn on world markets.

<TEXT>
   Tandon Corp. said Tuesday it has sold off the
disk-drive business on which the company was founded to Western
Digital Corp. for $49 million in cash and other considerations.
   Western Digital, of Irvine, a leading maker of computer storage,
communications, video controller and logic-processing units, also
will assume about $28 million in Tandon liabilities, the companies
said.
   The deal, which was agreed to in December and completed Tuesday,
involves Tandon's Winchester disk drive engineering and
manufacturing facilities in Santa Clara and San Jose, Calif., and
Singapore, as well as plated media operations in Santa Clara.
   Tandon, based in Chatsworth, will be left with its fledgling
business of manufacturing its own line of personal computers.
   As part of the deal, Tandon agreed to buy Western Digital
products to meet its production needs for at least two years.
   The acquisition of Tandon's disk-drive operations gives Western
Digital a business whose revenues grew to $280 million in 1987 from
$78 million in 1985.

   Class action suits have been filed against De
Laurentiis Entertainment Group Inc. and its founder, Italian film
producer Dino De Laurentiis, charging the defendants with
securities laws violations.
   The suits claim the defendants sold millions of dollars worth of
securities to the public, while misrepresenting or failing to
disclose information that would have been important to the
investors who bought them.
   The plaintiffs charged that the company's directors and others
``participated in the wrongdoing in order to continue and prolong
the illusions of the company's success as a financier, producer,
distributor and exploiter of theatrical motion pictures.''
   They also contend that De Laurentiis' management wasted
corporate assets in lavish spending and knowingly raised ``public
funds for such purposes.''
   They claim the film company failed to inform investors that De
Laurentiis, the former chairman of the entertainment group,
received more than $300,000 for use of a Beverly Hills mansion and
a Rolls Royce, the suit said.
   ``It is unfortunate that investors have seen more than $89
million of their money being lost,'' said Richard D. Greenfield, a
Haverford, Pa., attorney representing the plaintiffs. The suits
were filed Monday in Superior Court.
   The suits were filed on behalf of those who purchased De
Laurentiis securities between May 30, 1986 and June 22, 1987. The
securities included $65 million worth of notes and more than 2
million shares of common stock.
   De Laurentiis group attorney Robert Goldsmith declined comment,
saying he was unaware of the court action.
   The 68-year-old De Laurentiis stepped down from his post as
chairman and chief executive of the entertainment group last month
so that the company, which has been hit by a string of box-office
flops, could proceed with restructuring.
   The company posted losses of $36.2 million for the nine months
ended Nov. 30. It's failing films included ``Near Dark,''
``Weeds,'' ``Hiding Out,'' and ``Date With An Angel.''
   The suits, which seeks unspecified damages, also name
PaineWebber Inc., the company's underwriter, and an active promoter
of its securities.

   Stocks rose broadly today in heavy trading,
strengthened by dividend-related buying strategies, takeover
speculation and a desire by institutional money managers to improve
first-quarter portfolio performances.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 16.74 points
to 2,073.11 by 2 p.m. EST.
   Among broader market barometers, the New York Stock Exchange's
composite index measuring all listed issues rose 1.07 to 151.41.
The American Stock Exchange's market value index rose 1.56 to
295.70.
   Wall Street analysts said the market's strength was a good sign
that partly reflected a move by investment managers to put unused
money to work before the end of the first quarter March 31.
   ``The one thing institutions want to avoid is lack of
performance at end of a quarter,'' said Philip C. Puccio, manager
of institutional trading at Dillon Read & Co. in New York.
   Others said speculators who had sold stock on the hunch the
market would decline were aggressively buying, a phenomenon known
as short-covering which can boost prices dramatically.
   Activity in stocks subject to takeover speculation also helped
strengthen prices. Still, there was an underlying feeling that Wall
Street remains deeply affected by the uncertain aftermath of the
October crash.
   ``We're still in that bear market mentality,'' said Hank
Streifler, senior vice president on the trading floor at Shearson

<HEAD>Gulf & Western Posts 8.9 Percent Decline in 1st-Quarter Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gulf & Western Inc., the entertainment,
publishing and financial services giant, said its first-quarter
profit slipped 8.9 percent compared with strong results a year
earlier.
   Martin S. Davis, chairman and chief executive, said Tuesday the
results were in line with the company's expectations and that he
expected improvement for all of fiscal 1988.
   The company said its profit fell to $63.1 million, or $1.05 a
share, in its first fiscal quarter ended Jan. 31 compared with
earnings of $69.3 million, or $1.11 a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the first quarter rose 8.3 percent, to $1.18 billion
from $1.09 billion a year earlier.
   Operating income from motion pictures for the quarter was down
from record results for the Christmas holiday quarter a year
earlier, when the company had the movies ``Star Trek IV: The Voyage
Home,'' ``The Golden Child'' and ``Crocodile Dundee'' in U.S.
theaters and ``Top Gun'' in foreign release.
   This year, the company had the movies ``Eddie Murphy Raw'' and
``Fatal Attraction'' in U.S. theaters and ``Beverly Hills Cop II''
and ``The Untouchables'' in international release.
   Television operations reported higher operating income. Gulf &
Western produces television programs such as ``Cheers,'' operates
the Madison Square Garden cable TV network and owns 50 percent of
the USA cable network.
   Consumer publishing results were strong, but the costs of
product development depressed results from educational publishing
and professional information services.
   Consumer and commercial finance operations improved, as a result
of increased finance charge revenue and gains from insurance
operations as well as gains in credit card receivables and real
estate lending.
   Davis said one reason for his optimism about prospects for
earnings growth later this fiscal year is the planned release of
the films ``Crocodile Dundee II'' and ``Coming to America'' with
Eddie Murphy and revenue from syndication of the television shows
``Cheers,'' ``Webster'' and ``Family Ties.''
   The company also announced it had boosted its quarterly dividend
to 35 cents a share from 30 cents a share, payable April 1 to
shareholders of record March 18. In addition, Gulf & Western
declared a two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100 percent
stock dividend, payable May 2 to shareholders of record April 8.

   Bankers Trust New York Corp., the nation's
eighth-largest bank holding company, said Monday it will establish
a major operation in Edinburgh, Scotland, to provide global custody
facilities for British and European owners and managers of large
investment funds.
   Scottish Office Industry Minister and Member of Parliament Ian
Lang, said through the Scottish Development Agency here that the
move is an important boost for the expanding financial services
industry in Scotland.
   Bankers Trust already has 400 employees in Scotland through its
acquisition last August of Edinburgh-based World Markets Company,
which provides global financial information services. The new
operation will add another 150 jobs.
   A spokesman for the Scottish Development Agency's North American
offices, said that more than $158 billion in funds is managed in
Scotland, making it the second-largest financial services sector
behind London in the European Economic Community.

   Corning Glass Works said Tuesday that it

   Chairman James Houghton said he hoped the merger would broaden
Corning's laboratory services. The company said it planned to

   International Clinical operates 13 major laboratories, mainly in
the South and West, and had sales of $205 million last fiscal year
and net income of $4.8 million.
   Besides laboratory services, Corning makes consumer housewares,
optical fibers and other telecommunications equipment, and
specialty glass and ceramics.
   Its MetPath subisidiary, which is based in Teterboro, N.J., has
about a dozen testing labs nationwide.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, with wheat and corn futures
ending lower while soybeans advanced.
   The substantial losses in wheat futures were due to heavy
speculative selling stemming from a lack of major new export
business, analysts said.
   An Agriculture Department report showing the U.S. winter wheat
crop in good to fair condition was also seen as bearish for wheat
prices.
   And the USDA announced late Monday it would continue through
March 25 its thrice-weekly auctions of government-held wheat,
another negative factor for wheat prices.
   Soybean futures advanced on indications of rising world demand
for vegetable oils, analysts said.
   Most corn futures contracts finished fractionally lower in quiet
trading.
   ``I guess corn was kind of trapped between beans being up and
wheat being down,'' said Jerry Gidel, an analyst for G.H. Miller &
Co. in Chicago.
   At the close, wheat was 4 cents to 6 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $3 a bushel; corn was 1\ cent

   Trading designed to capture high-yielding dividends of utility

<TEXT>
   Share prices on the London Stock Exchange closed
lower Tuesday but above their worst levels after Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher ruled out an early cut in bank base lending rates.
   The market's attention once again was dominated by the strength
of the British pound on foreign-exchange markets. Trading volume
was light in most shares.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was down 3.2 points at 1815.0. The index fell as much as 9.4 points
in response to Mrs. Thatcher's statements, but then recovered
somewhat on the strength of early gains on Wall Street.
   Volume was 420.9 million shares, up slightly from 404.8 million
on Monday.
   The pound's strength sparked concern about the competitiveness
of British exports.
   But Mrs. Thatcher told the House of Commons the government
didn't intend to lower interest rates to curb the pound's strength,
for fear of spurring inflation.

<HEAD>New Cocoa Price-Support Scheme On Shaky Ground</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices for future delivery of cocoa rose Tuesday as a new
price-support scheme emerged from an international meeting in
London, but analysts said the plan was unlikely to halt the slide
in prices.
   On other markets, cattle futures advanced sharply while the pork
complex was mixed; grains and soybeans were mixed; precious metals
retreated; energy futures were mostly higher; and stock-index
futures advanced.
   The International Cocoa Organization's failure to reach
agreement on a new price-support plan after five days of meetings
triggered the automatic implementation of a scheme allowing the
ICCO to withhold up to 120,000 metric tons from the market.
   But the organization lacks sufficient funding to finance the
plan and its members, representing consumer and producer nations,
were sharply divided on what intervention price should trigger the
withholding mechanism, analysts said.
   ``It's very questionable whether the withholding program will
have any impact on the market,'' said Kim Badenhop, an analyst with
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.
   The spot price for cocoa has fallen more than $400 a metric ton
since July due primarily to abundant supplies and rising production.
   The ICCO intervened with a buffer-stock buying program that
began in January, but the organization exhausted the program's
250,000-metric-ton allocation within two months.
   The first news of the new price-support plan sparked a rally on
New York's Coffee Sugar & Cocoa Exchange, where the contract for
March delivery settled $17 higher at $1,600 a metric ton.
   But Badenhop said trading enthusiasm flagged on later reports
explaining the problems with the plan.
   Cattle futures posted impressive gains for the second
consecutive session on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in reaction
to higher cash prices for cattle, carcasses and boxed beef,
analysts said.
   The cattle market had been depressed due to a Lenten-season drop
in consumer demand for meat. But a wave of packing plant closings
last week has reduced beef supplies to the point where wholesale
prices have begun to rise, said William J. Arndt, an analyst in
Chicago for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Some concern remains that the drop in slaughters will lead to a
backlog of slaughter-ready animals but ``right now we're trading
the cash and the cash is strong,'' Arndt said.
   Hog futures followed cattle higher while frozen pork belly
futures retreated on an exchange report showing an unexpectedly
steep increase in supplies, he said.
   Live cattle settled .20 cent to 1.37 cents higher with April at
72.92 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .55 cent to .85 cent higher
with March at 81 cents a pound; hogs were .08 cent to .42 cent
higher with April at 43.72 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.75 cent lower to .25 cent higher with March at 53.95 cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures ended mixed on the Chicago Board of
Trade with wheat and corn finishing lower while soybeans advanced.
   The substantial losses in wheat were due to heavy speculative
selling linked to a lack of major new export business, analysts
said.
   An Agriculture Department report showing the U.S. winter wheat
crop in good to fair condition also was seen as bearish for wheat
prices.
   And the USDA announced late Monday it would continue through
March 25 its thrice-weekly auctions of government-held wheat,

   Soybean futures advanced on indications of rising global demand
for vegetable oils, analysts said.
   Most corn futures finished fractionally lower in quiet trading.
   Wheat settled 4\ cents to 6 cents lower with March at $2.99} a
bushel; corn was } cent lower to } cent higher with March at $2.01{
a bushel; oats were { cent lower to 1\ cents higher with March at
$1.92 a bushel; soybeans were 3\ cents to 4{ cents higher with
March at $6.17 a bushel.
   Most energy futures prices rose slightly on the New York
Mercantile Exchange in response to calls for meetings among
oil-producing nations, analysts said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 6 cents to 15 cents
higher with April at $15.45 a barrel; heating oil was .07 cent to
.19 cent higher with April at 43.49 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .23 cent lower to .41 cent higher with April at 43.71
cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures advanced slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for March delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled .80 point higher at 269.10. The underlying
spot index closed 2.05 points higher at 269.43.

   Stocks rose strongly Tuesday in a rally powered
by takeover speculation, dividend-related buying and increased
interest in blue chips, sending the Dow Jones average to its
highest finish since the October crash.
   The closely watched average of 30 industrial stocks, which had
been lagging behind the broader market recently, finished at
2,081.07, up 24.70, the best post-crash close since 2,071.62 on
Feb. 29. Other market indices also advanced.
   Wall Street analysts said the rally partly reflected a desire by
managers of institutional investment funds to put unused money to
work, especially because the first quarter is drawing to a close in
three weeks and the best-possible portfolios must be presented to
clients.
   ``We're coming into show-and-tell time, the window-dressing
period,'' said Lawrence Wachtel, an analyst at Prudential Bache
Securities Inc. ``These guys can't sit there with piles of cash in
a boiling market and not get called down by the people who pay them
to manage money.''
   Others said the increased interest in stocks reflected true
buying interest and waning anxiety by investors over the impact of
the Oct. 19 collapse, along with indications that the economy is
thriving.
   ``As we move further away from the October break, more people
have thrown away their bear market caps and put bull market caps
on,'' said Joseph Barthel, technical trading strategist at the
Butcher & Singer Inc. investment firm.
   Others agreed that the potential for a stronger rally exists and
some predicted the Dow Jones industrials would soon surpass the
2,100 barrier, but many professional strategists were reluctant to
declare that the underlying post-crash nervousness has evaporated.
   ``We're still in that bear market mentality,'' said Hank
Striefler, senior vice president on the trading floor at Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. ``We haven't moved over that hump.''
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading, gaining issues
outnumbered losers by 2-to-1, with 1,072 up, 535 down and 404
unchanged. Volume on the nation's largest stock market totaled
237.68 million shares, vs. 152.98 million in the previous session.
   Buying interest in selected stocks to capture high-yielding
dividends accounted for about 25 percent of the volume, which was
the highest since Jan. 25, when 275.25 million shares were traded.
   Among notably higher blue chip stocks, Procter & Gamble rose 1{
to 82\, Du Pont rose 2} to 87{, and General Electric rose 1{ to 44~.
   Oil stocks were boosted by takeover speculation in that
industry. Unocal rose 1~ to 37~, Kerr-McGee rose | to 36{ and
Phillips Petroleum rose { to 15].
   Digital Equipment fell 4 to 120] after the company unveiled a
line of powerful computers to challenge IBM. Analysts lowered their
earnings estimates for the company because it didn't introduce new
software for the computers.
   Metals stocks rose broadly, reflecting increased prices in the
metals markets. Reynolds rose 2 to 45], Asarco rose | to 24| and
Alcoa rose 1{ to 47}.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 267.02 million shares.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index of all listed issues
rose 1.09 to 151.62.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 2.90 to 312.42,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index rose 2.05 to 269.43.
   The Wilshire Associates 5,000 Equity Index, which measures the
market value of all U.S. stocks, rose $19.12 billion.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 1.90
to 296.04.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
closed at 376.93, up 2.39.

<HEAD>Ford Workers Receive 1987 Profit-Sharing Checks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mark Peabody didn't crack a smile as the
vice chairman of Ford Motor Co., surrounded by cameras and
microphones, leaned across the assembly line to hand him a check in
an envelope.
   ``I was kind of nervous _ all those TV cameras,'' he said after
Harold Poling chatted with him and gave him the check, Peabody's
share of Ford's industry-record $4.6 billion in 1987 profits.
   On Tuesday, Ford distributed $653 million in profit-sharing
checks averaging more than $3,700 to 156,479 hourly and salaried
workers _ a record in profit-sharing for any U.S. corporation.
   Most checks were distributed earlier in the day, but Peabody and
his pals on the main transmission assembly line at Ford's Livonia
Transmission plant agreed to wait until Poling could distribute
their checks in a ceremony recorded for posterity.
   ``It's not only the politicians who can call this Super
Tuesday,'' Poling told a crowd of cheering workers, adding that the
plant's 4,500 employees received $17.6 million, or an average of
$4,450 each.
   The Livonia Transmission workers' checks were higher than the
company average because the workers have high seniority and the
work force at the plant has remained stable for the past few years,
said Peter Pestillo, vice president for employee and external
affairs.
   Workers on Peabody's line assemble transmissions for
front-wheel-drive cars such as the popular Taurus-Sable and the new
Lincoln Continental. Most of them, Peabody included, said they are
lucky to be there at all.
   Most were on layoff from other plants and had enough seniority
to be called to work at Livonia when Ford added the line three
years ago.
   More than 160,250 Ford workers in the United States received
previous record profit-sharing checks averaging $2,100 for 1986,
when Ford earned $3.29 billion.
   Ford workers took home an average $2,100 in profit-sharing for
1985, $2,000 for 1984 and $400 for 1983, when the company
distributed the first checks.
   In the past five years, Ford said it has given out more than
$1.6 billion to its workers.
   General Motors Corp. workers received no share of GM's $3.56
billion in 1987 profits at the same time that the corporation said
it would distribute $184.6 million in stock bonuses to executives.
   GM workers also received no 1986 profit-sharing, although
executives received millions of dollars in cash and stock bonuses,
angering GM workers heading into national contract negotiations.
   GM, the nation's largest automaker, switched to the Ford
profit-sharing formula for 1988, but the company said that formula
still would have generated no profit-sharing had it been used for
1987.

<TEXT>
   Marks and Spencer PLC, Britain's most profitable
retailer, said Tuesday it signed an agreement to purchase the swank
U.S. clothing chain Brooks Brothers from Canada's Campeau Corp. for
$770 million.
   But it reiterated that the Brooks Brothers purchase is
conditional on the success of Campeau's $6.18 billion cash bid for
Federated Department Stores Inc., which is being contested by R.H.
Macy & Co.
   Marks and Spencer agreed to pay $720 million for Brooks Brothers
itself and for preferential rights to lease space in the enlarged
800-strong Campeau stores empire.
   The purchase price also included $50 million in exchange for
Campeau's pledge not to set up a speciality menswear chain in the
next five years that would compete with Brooks Brothers in Japan or
the United States.

<NOTE>Eds: Subs 15th graf to restore dropped figure for West German
marks.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar continued to slide Tuesday as the
British pound again soared and other major currencies took their
cue from sterling.
   Gold prices were mixed. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted a bid price of $435.70 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m.
EST, down from $436.80 late Monday.
   Analysts said the British currency was buoyed by high interest
rates and the strength of the country's economy.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher ruled out an early cut in
interest rates, giving the pound a further boost Tuesday. She told
Parliament a drop in rates ``would not be in the interest of
inflation at the present time.''
   Robert Ryan, a senior currency trader at Irving Trust Co., said
``interest rates across the board seem to be ruling the markets
right now,'' with the currencies of countries with higher yields _
such as the pound _ turning in the best performances.
   Sterling rose to $1.8415 from $1.8135 late Monday in London. In
later New York trading, the pound rose to $1.8425 from $1.8180 late
Monday. The pound has gained nearly 7 cents against the dollar in
two days.
   The dollar also continued under pressure because of signals that
the U.S. economy is strong, analysts said.
   Last Friday's Labor Department report that the unemployment rate
fell to 5.7 percent in January convinced traders that the economy
is healthier than had been expected.
   The market believed the economy ``could maintain demand for
stronger imports and keep the U.S. trade deficit wide,'' said Gary
Dorsch, a market analyst with LNS Financial Group in Chicago.
   Dorsch predicted the dollar could fall toward 165 West German
marks before there is central bank intervention to support the U.S.
currency.
   The dollar traded at 1.6668 marks in Europe, down from 1.6765
late Monday. In New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.6673 marks,
down from 1.6771 late Monday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 127.80 Japanese yen from
128.87 yen. Later, in London, the dollar edged back up to 128.10
yen, and in New York, it rose to 127.93 from 127.835 yen.
   Dorsch said the yen was down largely because of technical
factors.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.3770 Swiss francs, down from 1.3833; 5.64825
French francs, down from 5.7085; 1,231.00 Italian lire, down from
1,238.00; and 1.25375 Canadian dollars, down from 1.25415.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.6668 West German marks, down from 1.6765; 1.3790
Swiss francs, down from 1.3870; 5.6625 French francs, down from
5.6880; 1.8780 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8840; 1,234.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,239.75; and 1.2524 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2562.
   Gold fell on New York's Commodity Exchange, where it closed at
$435.30 a troy ounce, down from $437.30 late Monday.
   But gold rose in Europe in response to the dollar's weakness,
bullion dealers said.
   In London, gold increased to a late bid price of $438.10 a troy
ounce, up from $437.20 late Monday. Gold rose in Zurich,
Switzerland, to $436.50 an ounce from $436.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold dropped to a closing bid of $438.00
an ounce from $438.75.
   Silver prices fell in New York and London. On the Commodity
Exchange, silver slipped to $6.310 a troy ounce from $6.395 late
Monday. In London, silver fell to $6.36 a troy ounce from $6.42
late Monday.

   Pontiac is offering $500 cash rebates on its
$6,399, Korean-built Pontiac LeMans and, for those buying their
first new car, an additional $600 discount, the General Motors
Corp. division said Tuesday.
   Pontiac said it will offer the $500 rebate on all LeMans
delivered through April 30.
   Pontiac also added LeMans to the first-time buyer program
announced Friday. The program also offers $600 discounts to
first-time buyers of the Sunbird, Grand Am, Fiero and some Firebird
models and expires Sept. 30.
   With both discounts, the suggested base price of the LeMans for
a new buyer falls to $5,299.
   Also on Tuesday, Ford Motor Co. announced it was extending its
incentive campaign until May 11. The program offers rebates of up
to $1,000 on nine car models and up to $500 on seven trucks.
   ``Even though our combined car and truck sales during January
and February increased 26 percent over the year-ago period, the
incentive program is being extended to keep our dealers in a
competitive position,'' said Robert Rewey, Ford vice president for
sales.
   The campaign includes $500 rebates on Ford Escort,
manual-transmission Tempo, Mustang (except 2.3-liter engine model),
Bronco II, Aerostar, and F-150, F-250 and F-350 pickup trucks and
Mercury Lynx, Tracer and manual-transmission Topaz.
   It also offers rebates of $600 on most Ford Thunderbird and
Mercury Cougar models and $750 on the 2.3-liter engine Mustang, on
all Mustang models in California and Hawaii, and on Ford Taurus and
Mercury Sable.
   A $1,000 rebate is available on the Ford Thunderbird Turbo Coupe
and Mercury Cougar XR7.

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Standard Inc. said Tuesday it plans
enter negotiations with hostile suitor Black & Decker and other
potential purchasers, but will continue developing its defensive
recapitalization plan.
   In a release issued late Tuesday, American Standard said it
would pursue alternatives that include a sale of the company.
   ``American Standard expects to provide confidential information
to, and to engage in, discussions and negotiations with Black &
Decker and other potential purchasers of the company,'' American
Standard stated in the release.
   American Standard had been vehemently resisting Black & Decker's
overtures since the Towson, Md.-based company made its initial
buyout offer in late January.
   On Monday, New York-based American Standard had indicated it
would consider Black & Decker's latest offer of $73 a share for
American Standard's 31 million common shares outstanding, a total
of about $2.26 billion.
   American Standard, a plumbing and air conditioning manufacturer,
also said it was considering sweetening its own recapitalization
plan for a second time.
   The $2.3 billion recapitalization would pay shareholders $64 in
cash, $5 in securities and one share of stock in the recapitalized
company for each old share. The plan was revised last Friday from
an earlier proposal that had a cash portion of $59 a share.
   American Standard shares fell 25 cents to $73 a share Tuesday in
New York Stock Exchange trading. Black & Decker fell 25 cents to
$17.75 a share.
   Analysts had said Monday they expected American Standard to come
up with another sweetened proposal before the March 19 deadline for
the Black & Decker tender offer.

   The U.S. dollar rose marginally against the
Japanese yen Wednesday morning in Tokyo, while stock prices gained
following an overnight advance on Wall Street.
   The dollar traded at about 127.95 yen at late morning in Tokyo,
up from its opening of 127.80 yen. The dollar had dropped 1.07 yen
to 127.80 yen on Tuesday.
   Trading was quiet in foreign exchange, where dealers awaited the
outcome of U.S. presidential primary elections. The ``Super
Tuesday'' election results were expected Wednesday afternoon in
Japan.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average,
down 150.85 points on Tuesday, rose 103.62 points, or 0.41 percent,
to close the morning session at 25,465.73. Volume was a light 5.5
million shares.
   Michio Katsumata of Nomura Securities, Japan's largest brokerage
house, said Tokyo stock prices were supported by Tuesday's rally on
the New York Stock Exchange and by stabilization of the foreign
exchange market.
   Investors also appeared to be buying shares deemed to be at
bargain prices after the Tokyo market's decline on Tuesday, dealers
said.

   Officials of the Writers Guild of America's
western unit voted unanimously Tuesday not to allow guild members
to write for the Academy Awards show scheduled for next month.
   The producers of the Academy Awards had asked that the guild
allow the writers to continue working on the show.
   ``The board of directors of the Writers Guild of America West
voted unanimously this evening to deny the request for waiver from
the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science for the Academy
Awards ceremonies,'' said guild spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden.
   ``What that means is that Writers Guild writers will not be
writing the Academy Awards ceremonies,'' Ms. Rhoden added.
   The strike by 9,000 members of the Writers Guild of America
against the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers
began Monday, a week after their contract expired.
   Bob Werden, spokesman for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences, had said earlier Tuesday that the academy had asked for
the waiver. In past strikes, entertainment unions have usually
granted waivers for the Oscars.
   Without the waiver, ``we'll struggle on somehow,'' he had said.
   Scriptwriter Mel Shavelson, former WGA president, and another
union member, Jack Rose, were hired by the academy to write the
program, which is scheduled to be televised worldwide by ABC-TV on
April 11.
   ``If there is no waiver, I won't do the show,'' Shavelson said
Tuesday, adding the writing was far from complete. ``Most of the
work is done when the cast shows up at rehearsal. It's rewriting,
really.
   ``If there is no waiver, you will find out how good actors are
at ad-libbing,'' he said. In general, writers provide most material
for the hosts and presenters at the ceremony; the winners' thanks
are their own.
   Meanwhile, a federal mediator brought together negotiators for
9,000 striking scriptwriters and entertainment producers Tuesday to
outline differences in a walkout the union says could cripple
Hollywood.
   Bargainers for the writers and the producers began meeting at
midday with commissioner Leonard Farrell of the Federal Mediation
and Conciliation Service.
   In the early evening the meeting was recessed until 11 a.m.
Thursday.
   Both sides outlined differences and issues, but no bargaining
was conducted, said alliance spokesman Herb Steinberg. Sticking
points were writers' demands for increased fees and creative rights.
   The final offer by producers was rejected by the guild Sunday
and talks broke off. No new bargaining sessions were scheduled.
   About 2,000 pickets gathered Monday outside 20th Century Fox
studios. Meanwhile, producers urged writers to defy the picket
lines and said temporary replacements may be hired.
   There were no large picket line demonstrations Tuesday.
   As the writers marched, alliance president and chief negotiator
Nick Counter said producers may begin hiring temporary replacements
for striking writers until a settlement was reached.
   ``Our companies are encouraging whoever wants to come forward to
write these scripts,'' he said, urging union and non-union writers
to cross picket lines.
   Counter said non-guild writers were being sought to keep soap
operas afloat and to keep the wheels turning on Hollywood's game
show circuit.
   While the writer's guild said talk shows and soap operas would
be the first to feel the effects of the strike, probably turning to
reruns, the producers said other shows had stockpiled scripts.
   The WGA strike is the fourth since a 17-week walkout in 1973.
The longest, in 1981, lasted three months.
   ``It's the same kind of feeling as we had in 1981,'' Counter
said, predicting the strike may be an extended one. ``This could go
on even longer than that.''
   Speaking for the producers, Steinberg said: ``We feel all the
issues were dealt with fairly. They went on strike on issues we
felt were resolved.'' He added that producers were ``ready to write
a check for $550 million'' for a new three-year contract. The
alliance represents about 200 producers and studios.
