   Fire gutted a packed Bronx social club Sunday
afternoon, killing seven people and injuring more than 30, and
firefighters' efforts were hampered by screaming people trying to
get to relatives, authorities said.
   ``It was sheer panic,'' said firefighter Dennis Fennell. The
inside of the basement club was burned out and ``it looked like
people tried to claw out all of the walls,'' he said.
   Fire marshals were testing for the presence of flammable
liquids, said John Mulligan, a spokesman for the Fire Department.
The origin was considered suspicious because of the fire spread so
quickly, he said.
   The streets were filled with screaming people who tried to pull
equipment from firefighters and get to their friends, Fennell said.
   ``There were people running around crazy ...,'' said firefighter
Joseph Kisonas. ``When we went to go do our job, people were trying
to fight the tools away from us. It was crazy. They wanted to pull
us one way and then another way trying to get us to the people
trapped in the basement.''
   Firefighters said five bodies were found in the club, some still
in chairs. Another person died shortly after the fire at a hospital
and the seventh died about eight hours later at New York
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, a spokeswoman said.
   Most of the injured, including six firefighters and two
Emergency Service technicians, were suffering from smoke inhalation
and were taken to hospitals.
   Mulligan described the club as about 50 feet by 75 feet with
7-foot ceilings. Between 60 and 100 people were packed inside.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch, who toured the blaze aftermath, described
the club as a ``rabbit warren.''
   ``If people were running for their lives, they'd run down blind
alleys and be trapped,'' said Koch, who described the space as
confined and made up of small, partitioned cubicles.
   ``It's clear that it should have never been opened in the first
place,'' he said of the club.
   Philip J. Burns, a deputy fire chief, said the private bar known
to neighbors as ``the hole'' was illegal because bars in basements
are prohibited and the exits were inadequate.
   A resident of the area, Paul Govia, 25, said the club operated
24 hours a day. ``Police often raided the place,'' he said.
Authorities said they have trouble keeping illegal clubs closed
because there are hundreds in the city.
   The fire was reported about 12:30 p.m. and firefighters were
``met by hysterical civilians streaming up the staircase,''
Mulligan said.
   ``One firefighter told me he literally had to fight his way down
the stairs,'' Mulligan said.
   Most escaped through the club's front door and narrow staircase,
but others were able to break through a wall near the back. A
second door on the side of the club was locked, Mulligan said.
   Eighteen engine companies, nine ladder units and about 150
firefighters brought the five-alarm blaze under control about 3:15
p.m., Mulligan said.

<TEXT>
   Omar Abakr Idris removes his shoes before
wading through the knee-deep fetid water left behind by the worst
rains on record in this desert capital.
   Each step across what used to be a dusty dirt road unleashes an
overpowering stench. The vast expanse of water is contaminated with
excrement from overflowing pit latrines and from dogs, goats and
donkeys living in the village.
   Idris' village of Mayo, a shantytown of about 50,000 on
Khartoum's southeastern fringe, was among the areas hardest hit by
the deluge Aug. 4-5.
   ``We are struggling with life here now,'' said Idris, 48. ``We
are without water, without food, without homes, without transport,
without anything.''
   The storm dumped 8.4 inches of rain in 14 hours, six times the
amount that fell in all of 1987. For the past 30 years, annual
rainfall has not exceeded 4.3 inches.
   At least 58 people died, most as their mud huts collapsed on
them. Up to 1.5 million people _ more than a third of Khartoum's
nearly 4 million inhabitants _ were left homeless and more than
150,000 dwellings were destroyed, according to government figures.
   Most vulnerable were the people living in Mayo and 22 other
squatter camps around Khartoum. The illegal settlements hold
500,000 to 700,000 people who fled Sudan's southern civil war and
widespread drought. The vast camps of mud huts and burlap-covered
shacks are desperately poor and occupy the worst land.
   The Moslem-dominated government, at war with the Christian and
animist south, long has tried to discourage further settlement in
the squatter areas. It denies the areas any social services and
forbids the displaced people living there from digging wells.
   Official neglect threatened to leave most of the displaced
people beyond the reach of international relief after the storm.
The government initially refused aid but ultimately relented in the
face of the sheer magnitude of the disaster and the threat of
epidemics sweeping from the camps.
   Many relief workers still worry the unplanned areas will receive
less than their fair share of government aid.
   ``There will be a natural built-in bias towards planned areas,''
said Bryan Wannop, resident representative of the U.N. development
program which is helping coordinate non-government relief.
   Emergency aid has yet to reach most of those affected by the
flood, many of whom live in areas isolated by stagnant lakes which
have nowhere to drain.
   Nearly all the mud huts in Marzuk, an unplanned area of about
15,000 people in Omdurman across the Nile river from Khartoum, were
destroyed or damaged by the rains. The people said they needed
plastic sheeting and tents.
   ``They are very important because the children now are sleeping
outside,'' said Abdullahim Kody, a resident.
   ``Once I had two rooms,'' Kody said, pointing to a mound of
hardening mud. ``Unfortunately, they have fallen down.''
   Kody, Idris and others interviewed nearly two weeks after the
disaster said they received no help from anyone and were
desperately in need of food, shelter, and medicine.
   Health officials are predicitng deadly epidemics of water-borne
diseases as people cut off from drinking water supplies are forced
to drink from the pools left behind by the rainstorm.
   Thousands already have developed diarrhea. Malaria and typhoid
also are on the rise, and cholera is an imminent risk.
   Dr. Nicholas Ward, a world health organization expert on
diarrheal diseases an immunization, predicted 400,000 people,
mostly children, will get sick and at least 4,000 will die.
   Without treatment, as many as 40,000 will perish, Ward
estimated. But he said emergency health clinics established in
response to the disaster should forestall the worst.
   Diarrhea kills the young and the weak primarily through
dehydration and is treatable with a simple rehydrating mixture of
salt, sugar and water. But lack of fresh water supplies make even
this basic therapy difficult.
   Sudanese authorities blame insufficient supplies for delays in
granting relief. More than 2,000 tons of tents, blankets, medicine,
plastic sheeting, food and other items have poured into Sudan, but
officials have said it is about a tenth of what is needed.
   Disorganization and the dilapidated infrastructure of this North
African nation of 23 million also have hampererd the relief
operation.
   The rains knocked out telephones, disrupting coordination
between the army-run operation and non-governmental agencies. The
downpour also created mud bogs of roads already strewn with
potholes from years of neglect.
   Another threat comes from the swollen Nile river, which already
has swamped some island villages and is brimming near street level
in the capital. Officials are not sure when or whether the river
might overflow into the city.
   A pair of British cartographers working with government
surveyors has begun work on a contour map which will help determine
how much higher the Nile would have to rise before spilling into
Khartoum's streets.
   In the meantime, relief efforts will continue. And people like
Osman Geragandi Koko, who lives in a settlement built on a garbage
pile in north Khartoum, will do what they must to find food and
shelter.
   ``Previously there was drought and we got through that,'' he
said. ``We hope to get through this too.''

<HEAD>Two American Activists Arrested In South Korea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two American activists who addressed a
student rally last week were arrested and ordered expelled for
taking part in radical political meetings, the U.S. Embassy said
today.
   The two were identified as Susan Bailey, 31, a secretary in the
history department at the University of Maryland, and Charles
Scheiner, 37, a White Plains, N.Y., computer salesman.
   A U.S. consular officer said Ms. Bailey and Scheiner were
arrested late Saturday leaving a meeting with other activitists.
Both had tourist visas that prohibited them from any political
activity, said a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The two were held overnight by Seoul Immigration authorities and
ordered to leave the country ``for activities inconsistent with
their visa status.''
   There were no available flights Sunday, so U.S. officials said
the two spent Sunday night at the airport and would leave today.
   Both Ms. Bailey and Scheiner spoke to a rally at Yonsei
University Aug. 15 for some 3,000 students assembled to march to
the border truce site of Panmunjom for talks with North Korean
student delegates on reuniting the divided Korean peninsula.
   The government banned the march and riot police arrested 200
students.
   The Americans said they were here at the invitation of the
Korean Peace Research Institute to attend an international peace
conference.
   Ms. Bailey said that she represented the People's Anti-War
Mobilization Movement based in Washington D.C., which she described
as ``a guerilla movement which wants the government to spend money
on social causes, not defense.''
   Scheiner said he represented a group called National
Mobilization for Survival which wanted U.S. military forces pulled
out of all foreign nations.

<DATELINE>SANTA MARIA DEL ORO, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the new U.S. immigration
law went into effect last year, this town in Durango cattle country
500 miles south of El Paso, Texas, feared for its future.
   For nearly half a century, it had supplied Mexicans who worked
legally or illegally in the United States and sent home the dollars
that helped keep the town going.
   But the catastrophe Santa Maria del Oro braced for 14 months ago
hasn't happened.
   Thousands of dollars still pour in every day, in money orders
sent by residents' relatives working, most of them illegally, in
the United States.
   Mayor Epifanio Carreon had feared the flow of dollars would dry
up and, worse, hundreds of young men would come home looking for
jobs that don't exist.
   ``We would have seen at least some economic affects of the law
by now, but everything is totally normal,'' Carreon says now.
   ``The dollar continues being the most important source of income
in this region,'' said Roberto Acosta, assistant manager of Banco
Internacional, the only bank in the area people that cashes dollar
checks.
   ``Some people returned because of fear before they knew what was
going to happen with the law. But now things are back to normal.''
   One young man in town said, however, he's waiting to see what
happens with the law _ the U.S. Immigration Control and Reform Act
_ before he attempts his first crossing.
   ``If it weren't for the law I'd already be in Los Angeles,''
said Rocky Rocha, 18, who just graduated from a technical school
here.
   He said two of his brothers already there had applied for
amnesty under the U.S. law and fear they'll lose out if they harbor
him as an illegal alien.
   ``If my brothers will let me, I'll go in spite of the law,''
said Rocha. ``Here you work so hard and you don't make much.''
   Santa Maria del Oro has supplied the U.S. labor market with a
steady stream of workers since World War II.
   Many residents went to the United States as farm workers under
the U.S. bracero program of 1942, said Mayor Carreon. By now, some
have gained U.S. citizenship or legal residency.
   By the time the program was dropped in 1964, many local
residents had grown accustomed to having a steady job and earning
dollars.
   Besides, said Carreon, the local gold and mining operations were
winding down and there wasn't much left to do here but work in the
fields or raise cattle. The only major employer around these days
is a lumber company, which has about 300 workers.
   Miguel Angel Salinas, the municipal clerk, estimates that more
than 30 percent of the town's 14,000 people still go back and forth
to jobs in the United States.
   Authorities estimate the percentage of people on surrounding
farms and ranches with relatives working in the United States is as
high or even higher.
   Carreon said the steady flow of dollars _ as much as $60,000 a
week _ has helped Santa Maria del Oro weather Mexico's 6-year-old
economic crisis.
   Indeed, by Mexican standards Santa Maria del Oro is well off.
   The main streets are filled with late-model U.S. and Mexican
pickup trucks, many bearing U.S. license plates. There are no
beggars on the streets. Many of the homes and businesses were
financed with dollars.
   Residents and public officials here say the law has helped those
who hve been in the United States for a long time and wanted to
stay there.
   Manuel Sanchez returned several years ago and bought a butcher
shop with the money he earned as an undocumented worker in Chicago.
   His brother, a Chicago butcher, stayed and has applied for
amnesty, the provision of the law allowing foreigners who meet
certain requirements to seek legal residency.
   ``He feels a lot safer knowing that when he leaves the house (in
Chicago) he'll return,'' Sanchez said.
   Illegal aliens caught in the United States most often are
deported immediately.
   For others who didn't qualify for amnesty under the law or just
didn't bother to apply, it's business as usual: a sundown trek
across the border.
   ``We'll stay as long as there's work. When there's not we'll
come back crying,'' said Jesus Chavez, 29, who has worked in the
United States as an undocumented worker for a decade.
   ``Right now the work is there waiting for us,'' said Chavez, one
of three brothers working without documents at a California
construction company.
   Chavez, home on vacation, said the $21 an hour he earns makes
the risk of crossing as an illegal alien worthwhile.
   Similar work in Mexico probably would pay him about $12 a day.
   ``Right now it (the law) hasn't affected us at all,'' said Luis
Chavez, Jesus' 18-year-old brother who began working illegally in
the United States when he was 14.
   The toughest provision of the U.S. law went into effect this
past June 1, making it illegal for most employers to knowingly hire
undocumented workers. The law calls for stiff fines and even jail
sentences for violators.
   Agricultural workers now in the United States have been given an
extension to Dec. 1 to get their papers in order or leave.
   Although crossing the border without legal documents is the
risky part, those who've worked in the same job in the United
States since before 1982 don't have to show employers their
documents.

   As the smoke clears in the Persian Gulf
war with a U.N.-sponsored truce, Iran and Iraq are counting the
cost of a conflict that killed an estimated 1 million people but
ended with no victor.
   Peace talks scheduled to start Thursday in Geneva are likely to
be long and tough. Iran and Iraq are ancient enemies, and eight
years of war have only deepened old hatreds.
   Both countries, bled by the war, face mammoth tasks in
rebuilding their economies despite the oil wealth they used to
bankroll their military machines.
   Iran also faces the prospect of political turmoil as hardliners
such as Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, a vociferous critic
of ``defeatist'' diplomatic efforts to end the war; and more
pragmatic leaders, particularly Parliament Speaker Hashemi
Rafsanjani, battle for supremacy.
   Rafsanjani, considered the most powerful figure in Iran after
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, is widely seen as the man who
engineered Tehran's unconditional acceptance of the U.N. cease-fire
resolution last month when he realized Iran's military machine was
weakening after a string of battlefield defeats this year.
   Khomeini endorsed Rafsanjani's decision, widely seen as the
speaker's biggest political gamble, although the ailing patriarch
stressed that for him, ending the war was ``worse than drinking
poison.''
   So far, no senior Iranian leader has publicly challenged that
decision, which most Iranians have welcomed after eight years of
appalling human loss.
   But Rafsanjani, who also has made clear he seeks to end Iran's
isolation, faces an increasingly strong array of radicals led by
Mohtashemi and the prosecutor-general, Mohammad Khoeinihia, leader
of the militants who seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in November
1979, who oppose his pragmatist policies.
   They consider his efforts to end a war he clearly believed Iran
could never win flies in the face of the revolution's aim of
spreading Islamic fundamentalism.
   Analysts say the internal struggle for supremacy after Khomeini,
which has been swelling over the last two years as the patriarch's
health deteriorated, has only been intensified by Tehran's
acceptance of the cease-fire.
   On the ground, the two belligerents wound up virtually where
they started in September 1980, when Iraq invaded Iran, the map
unchanged after one of the longest conventional wars this century.
   Iraq's President Saddam Hussein, whose 1980 invasion is seen by
military analysts a major blunder, has emerged at least for now
more solidly entrenched in power in Baghdad.
   Iraq, which spent as much as $10 billion a year on its war
effort, is as much as $85 billion in debt, according to Western
economists. That makes it one of the world's biggest debtor nations.
   The war cost Iran an estimated $400 billion. Although it still
has about $5 billion in foreign reserves, its economy is in
tatters, its industry, particularly its oil installations, pounded
by Iraq's powerful air force.
   Khomeini, whose hatred of Hussein turned the war into a bloody
vendetta, remains the unchallenged authority in Iran.
   But his surprise decision last month to accept the cease-fire,
despite his exhortations to ``fight to the last drop of blood'' to
topple the Iraqi leader, has dented the 88-year-old religious
patriarch's credibility.
   The Iraqis, armed with superior weaponry and technology, won
something simply by surviving Iran's human-wave offensives and
wearing down the numerically superior Iranians, although Iraq used
outlawed chemical weapons and hammered Iranian cities with bombers
and missiles.
   Iran, virtually friendless and starved of the arsenal of
high-tech weaponry the Iraqis employed, can claim that it repelled
the invaders and fought them to a standstill.
   The war undoubtedly helped cement Khomeini's 1979 Islamic
revolution. Opponents of the cleric-dominated Tehran regime charge
that the fundamentalists deliberately perpetuated the conflict to
consolidate the infant republic and Khomeini's stern brand of Islam.
   With an end to the war now a possibility, the Arab countries of
the oil-rich gulf who were caught in the crossfire, and the rest of
the Moslem world, are heaving a collective sigh of relief.
   But an end to the war will have strategic repercussions far
beyond the gulf.
   Israel fears that Iraq, which has participated to some extent in
every Arab-Israeli war over the last four decades, eventually will
turn its combat-hardened military machine again on the Jewish state.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said last month that although he
did not see any danger of an imminent Iraqi attack, the military
buildup by Arab states spawned by the gulf war could be used
against Israel.
   With the gulf war out of the way, the Arab states are expected
to refocus their attention on efforts to solve the older
Arab-Israeli conflict.
   If Rafsanjani and his supporters, such as Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati, succeed in out-maneuvering their hard-line
opponents in Tehran, Iran's relations with the West are likely to
improve.
   That, in turn, has raised hopes that Iran can be persuaded to
use its influence with pro-Iranian Shiite extremists in Lebanon to
free foreign hostages, including nine Americans.

   Five years after dissident leader
Benigno Aquino was killed, the slaying remains unsolved and his
goal of a peaceful, stable democracy unfulfilled in the turbulent
country now governed by his widow.
   On Aug. 21, 1983, the senator stepped from a China Airlines jet
and into Philippine history, gunned down moments after returning
from the United States to challenge President Ferdinand Marcos for
leadership of the Philippines.
   The killing outraged the nation and emboldened a fragmented
opposition, paving the way for the uprising that toppled Marcos and
propelled Corazon Aquino to the presidency on Feb. 25, 1986.
   Now, statues of ``Ninoy,'' the senator's nickname, stand in
major cities, and the airport where he died bears his name. Mrs.
Aquino has said repeatedly that if it were not for his death, she
never would have risen to power.
   But the trial of 40 defendants charged in the assassination
drags on nearly 16 months after it began, bogged down in a complex
legal system.
   In September 1986, the Supreme Court voided acquittals handed
down by a Marcos-era tribunal and ordered a retrial. The slow pace
of the trial typifies the unfinished agenda of an administration
made possible by the Aquino slaying.
   The political turbulence that made such a killing possible
haunts the country. For many, the lofty hopes that Marcos' ouster
alone would restore stability and prosperity have given way to
frustration.
   ``Five years after Ninoy's death, the Cory government has become
the government it warned us against,'' wrote columnist Conrado de
Quiros in the Philippine Daily Globe, a frequent critic of the
administration.
   Critics in the freewheeling Manila press often ignore Mrs.
Aquino's accomplishments, preferring instead to hold her to the
idealistic promises of justice, domestic peace and social reform
she espoused.
   Despite the insurgency and right-wing coup plots, her
administration drafted a new constitution, restored a bicameral
legislature and held national and regional elections in its first
two years.
   The administration reversed three years of economic decline and
posted a 5.5 percent growth in the gross national product in its
first full year.
   But for millions of Filipinos, more than 60 percent of whom live
in poverty, the slow pace of change has done little to improve
their daily lives. Inflation in the Manila area, triggered by
increases in prices of food and fuel, is approaching 10 percent.
   Allegations of continuing corruption have been raised not only
by the press but by Manila Archbishop Cardinal Jaime Sin, the
country's best known cleric and an Aquino supporter.
   Communist rebels still wield power in rural areas, and urban
guerrillas have escalated street assassinations in the capital
itself. Right-wing ``death squads'' have retaliated with their own
attacks against labor activists and suspected leftists.
   ``If the principal element of (Aquino's) death was violence, it
is only fitting that the people who were shocked by the incident
and who felt sorry for the late senator should now shun violence
and work to strengthen the rule of law,'' said The Manila Bulletin
in an editorial Sunday. ``Violence still stalks the land, because
many do not respect the rule of law.''
   Growing disaffection prompted Vice President Salvador Laurel
this month to accuse the administration of incompetence, failing to
stem the rebellion and tolerating corruption on the scale of
Marcos. Laurel called on Mrs. Aquino to resign and call new
elections.
   Although Laurel's allegations were similar to those of some of
Mrs. Aquino's supporters, his charges won little public support,
mostly because of the vice president's reputation as a political
opportunist.
   ``But if (Laurel's) purpose was to jolt Cory Aquino into waking
up from her dream presidency and facing the nightmare it has become
for the Filipino people, then it certainly deserves a fair and just
assessment,'' wrote columnist Nestor Mata in The Manila Standard.
   Mrs. Aquino's strongest supporters frequently dismiss criticism
as attempts by her opponents to undermine her government.
Pro-Aquino columnists claim the latest round of criticism is part
of a right-wing plot to tarnish her reputation among the public.
   ``Under the Aquino regime, blame is immediately being heaped on
faceless, nameless people who are `out to destabilize the
government,''' wrote columnist Ninez Cacho-Olivarez in the
Philippine Daily Inquirer. ``It is the insecure and paranoid who
see goblins at every turn.''
   Meanwhile, Mrs. Aquino herself has become more isolated from the
Philippine press. She rarely gives press conferences or interviews.
   Recently, the presidential palace banned ``ambush interviews,''
where reporters would shout questions at the president as she
walked to her office every morning.

<HEAD>National Guard Says No Proof Of Waiting List</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   No evidence existed of a waiting list to get
into the Indiana National Guard headquarters unit Sen. Dan Quayle
joined in May 1969, Guard officials said Saturday.
   ``The existence or non-existence of any `waiting list' as to HHD
(Quayle's unit) cannot be verified due to the fact that no such
list can be found. Units were not required to maintain such lists
if they were under-strength and personal memories do not recall
such a list,'' two former top officers said in a statement released
Saturday.
   The statement was from John N. Owens, former adjutant general of
Indiana, and Robert G. Moorhead, former commander of the 38th
Infantry Division.
   Since Quayle was nominated as the Republican vice presidential
candidate, questions have been raised as to whether he used family
influence to gain entrance to the Guard.
   Owens and Moorhead point out that records show the headquarters
unit Quayle joined had vacanies the month before, the month of and
the month after the senator's enlistment.
   Quayle's unit had an authorized strength of 138 soldiers but had
134 people in April, 132 in May and 133 in June, Brig. Gen. James
Barney, deputy commander of the Indiana State Area Command, said at
a news conference Saturday.
   Neither Owens nor Moorhead could recall any inquiries on behalf
of Quayle.

   A strong earthquake hit the Himalayan
kingdom of Nepal and parts of eastern India on Sunday morning,
triggering landslides and collapsing buildings. First reports said
100 people may have died.
   Nepal's Department of Geology said the earthquake struck at 4:54
a.m. (7:09 p.m. EDT Saturday) and measured 5.7 on the Richter scale.
   The department said the quake was centered near Udayapur, a town
near the Indian-Nepalese border and 100 miles southeast of
Katmandu, Nepal's capital. Officials said the temblor lasted about
40 seconds.
   In New Delhi, the Seismologoical Observatory said the quake
measured 6.5 on the Richter scale.
   The state-run Radio Nepal said at least 27 people were killed in
the towns of Bhaktapur and Dharan when they were buried by
collapsing houses.
   Press Trust of India news agency said that in addition to 100
feared dead in India and Nepal, 1,000 people were injured in the
Indian states of Bihar, Sikkim and West Bengal.
   A Nepalese journalist in Dharan, 130 miles southeast of
Katmandu, said by telephone that ``20 people have already died. A
large number of injured were being taken to local hospitals and a
rescue operation is under way. Men of the Royal Nepal Army, police,
social workers and other local inhabitants are taking part in the
rescue operation.''
   The journalist added that ``90 percent of the house of Vijapur
area of Dharan collapsed.''
   Police reported seven people died in Bhaktapur, an ancient town
seven miles east of Katmandu, while 20 others suffered injuries.
   The quake was also felt in the Indian capital of New Delhi and
Calcutta, but there was no report of any casualties.
   One hard-hit Indian city was Dharbhanga in Bihar state, where 14
children were believed killed when their school hostel collapsed.
   Dharbhanga, with a population of 200,000, is 550 miles east of
New Delhi.
   Several homes in the residential areas of Dharbhanga have
collapsed, killing an unspecified number of people.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph.
Every increase of one number means the ground motion is 10 times
greater.
   A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage in
populated areas while one measuring 6 can cause severe damage.

   A car bomb exploded next to a Syrian army
checkpoint in Moslem west Beirut on Sunday morning, wounding at
least 15 people, police said.
   Police said a Syrian soldier at the checkpoint was among the
casualties. Most of the other wounded were Lebanese civilians,
including women and children.
   A cream-colored Mercedes packed with 88 pounds of TNT blew up at
8:40 a.m. (1:40 a.m. EDT), only two yards from the checkpoint
opposite a restaurant in the seaside Raouche district, police
reported.
   At least eight cars parked nearby were destroyed.
   Police said the car had been parked Saturday evening near the
restaurant which perches atop a cliff overlooking the
Mediterranean. They could not determine who owned the Mercedes.
   Syrian troops, armed with rocket-propelled grenades and
automatic rifles, sealed off the blast scene.
   Red Cross ambulances evacuated the casualties as the Syrians
fired in the air to make way for them.
   A police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said most
of the wounded were passers-by. He said none of the restaurant's
staff or customers was hurt.
   The corniche where the bomb exploded is popular with Sunday
morning strollers.
   Twisted metal and glass shards from a nearby six-story apartment
building, the Mayfair casino, and another restaurant were strewn
for 150 yards around the scene of the explosion.
   ``I heard a powerful explosion that hurled me several meters.
Pieces of glass rained on me,'' said a 28-year-old casino employee
who declined to be named.
   The car bombing was the eleventh in Lebanon this year. The last
car bomb blew up in west Beirut's Cola district July 22, killing
seven people and wounding 48.
   More than 130,000 people have been killed in Lebanon's
13-year-old civil war between Moslems and Christians.

   A strong earthquake triggered landslides
and destroyed houses in the mountainous India-Nepal border region
early Sunday, killing at least 237 people and injuring more than
1,500, officials and news reports said.
   Seismologists said it was the deadliest earthquake to strike the
Himalayan region since 1950.
   More than 100 people died when the quake rumbled through the
eastern Indian state of Bihar, officials said. In Nepal,
authorities said at least 137 people were dead. Officials in both
countries predicted the death toll would rise after they received
reports from remote areas which were hit harder.
   ``The tolls have come in only from urban areas,'' said V.K.
Sharma, deputy secretary in the Bihar government.
   The temblor also jolted parts of northern Bangladesh and the
capital of Dhaka, but there were no immediate reports of casualties
or damage.
   Witnesses said windows and doors rattled, buildings cracked and
people roused from their sleep ran screaming from their homes as
objects tumbled from shelves and tables.
   ``My bed rattled, then it began swinging,'' said R.N. Rudra, a
resident of Patna, the Bihar capital. ``My dogs began barking and I
rushed out of the house.''
   At least 1,000 people were injured when the quake triggered
landslides and house collapses in Bihar and the surrounding states
of Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Orissa, all heavily populated,
largely agricultural areas.
   The quake also was felt in Sikkim and Tripura, located in the
Himalayan foothills, the Press Trust of India news agency said.
   In Nepal, a Foreign Ministry official, Shailendra Kumar
Upadhyaya, said more than 500 people were injured and thousands of
houses collapsed from the quake's impact.
   ``Most of them (were) buried alive under collapsed houses,''
said Indra Shrestha, a social worker involved in the rescue
operation in Dharan Bazar, a township of about 100,000 people about
18 miles from the Indian border.
   Shrestha said rescue operations were being hampered by the
monsoon rains, which hit the subcontinent in late June and usually
last through September.
   Both countries were rushing emergency medical teams to the area.
The Red Cross of Nepal issued urgent appeals for blood donations.
   In India's Bihar state, communications with Darbhanga, which
appeared to be the worst-hit area, were disrupted. The Press Trust
of India said a school hostel in the town collapsed, killing at
least 17 children. It said more bodies were feared buried under the
debris.
   The quake damaged most of the houses in Darbhanga, the news
agency said, quoting P.K. Patnaik, the top civil administrator in
the district. Deaths were also reported in the neighboring towns of
Munger, Keoti and Narpatnagar.
   The tremor also was felt in the eastern city of Calcutta, Press
Trust of India said. There were no immediate reports of casualties
but residents were quoted as saying windows of several homes
vibrated and doors rattled.
   The Seismological Observatory in New Delhi said the quake hit at
4:40 a.m. (7:10 p.m. EDT Saturday) and was centered 40 to 50 miles
northeast of the town of Darbhanga in Bihar state, along the
India-Nepal border. Observatory Director H.N. Srivastava said the
quake measured 6.5 on the Richter scale.
   Srivastava said the quake lasted about one minute and
aftershocks continued for about an hour. Seismologists warned
aftershocks could continue for days.
   The U.S. Geological Survey said its initial seismograph readings
placed the center of the quake 100 miles southeast of Katmandu, the
capital of Nepal. Geological Survey monitors in Golden, Colo.,
recorded the earthquake at a preliminary magnitude of 6.7 on the
Richter scale.
   The Richter scale gauges the energy released by an earthquake as
measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A quake of
magnitude 6 is capable of causing severe damage.
   Earthquakes are common in the Himalayan region. On Aug. 6 a
quake of magnitude 7.3 shook the states of Assam, Manipur, West
Bengal and Bihar. Four people were killed. India's worst earthquake
was in 1950, when at least 30,000 people were killed in Assam state.

<HEAD>Midways Open in Heat and Drought with Reeling Livestock, Melting
Ice Cream</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BERNARD SCHOENBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Reeling livestock, sizzling sidewalks, ice cream through a straw
_ these are a few of the added detractions at Midwest state fairs
in a summer of killing heat and devastating drought.
   The fairs still feature Ferris wheels and funhouses, midway
crowds of farmers in coveralls, girls in summer dresses, swarms of
eager kids _ and traditional summer fare like corn on the cob,
butterfly porkchop sandwiches, cotton candy and snow cones.
   But it's not the same.
   ``You don't feel like eating,'' said Don Carlson, 66, of
Belvidere, at the Illinois State Fair in Springfield. ``You want
something, but you don't.''
   ``And the ice cream melts so fast,'' said his wife, Vi.
   The parched, hot summer that has turned city lawns brown and
urbanites crabby has been a disaster for the Midwest, where growers
grimly contemplate shriveled fields in autumn colors and deep cuts
in projected grain harvests.
   At the fairgrounds, it makes for smaller produce and livestock _
and even some casualties.
   On Tuesday, when the temperature hit 102 degrees in
Indianapolis, ``there were four fatals in the poultry division, and
they were chickens,'' said Indiana State Fair spokesman Jeff
Fisher. The owners, he noted, had left their entries in cars ``with
the windows rolled up.''
   By Thursday, five rabbits, two hogs and eight chickens died from
the 97-degree heat, and livestock exhibitors were taking extra
precautions to keep their animals comfortable in fairground barns.
   ``They're packing some down with ice, they're putting ice in
front of fans to blow cool air,'' Fisher said. ``They're coming up
with some ingenious ways to handle the heat stress.''
   Although state fairs in the heartland traditionally draw
millions of people each year, attendance is down somewhat this
summer in some states.
   Fairgoers cheer or challenge in contests ranging from
horse-racing to horseshoes, from husband-calling to hog-calling.
   They relax with rock music and symphonies; they scrutinize
blue-ribbon displays of produce or livestock or home crafts; they
ride the rides or line up to try the midway games of skill for pink
pandas or funny hats; they inspect displays of new farm machinery.
   Some forget their troubles _ for the moment.
   ``It is a time that you can just go and forget all about the
corn ... or other headaches that you have,'' said Dana Trimble,
manager of a company that grows seed corn. Trimble plays drums and
his farmer father, Gene, plays trumpet with a band of strolling
players _ in clown gear _ at the Illinois fairgrounds every year.
   ``People kind of want to get away from the farm. It's been a
tough year,'' said John E. Ward, board president for the Indiana
fair.
   At the 18-day Ohio State Fair in Columbus, which drew 3.5
million last year, attendance was down 7 percent for the first 12
days. Free tickets went out to some drought-stricken farmers to
squelch rumors of cancellation.
   Missouri State Fair director Bill Waddell said rain would help
the state reach its goal of 350,000 visitors to the 11-day fair
that ends Aug. 28 at Sedalia _ with air-conditioning for indoor
activities.
   Relentless hot weather ``could hurt us, but it always seems to
rain during the fair,'' Waddell said.
   Officials of the Michigan State Fair, which begins its 140th run
Friday, said entries were down only slightly.
   ``We've set aside an area with a large tent and nice cool water
and lemonade,'' said fair manager Bernie Lennon. ``It will be a
little oasis.''
   Officials at the Iowa State Fair were optimistic about
attendance as the fair began its 11-day run Thursday. Butch Webb of
Wichita, Kan., working in 104-degree heat Wednesday to prepare the
fairgrounds, said that while this summer was ``a little bit
extreme, I don't remember setting up ... and not being covered with
sweat.''
   Spokeswoman Kathie Swift recalled a 108-degree reading at Iowa's
1983 fair.
   The Wisconsin State Fair, which ended Aug. 14 at West Allis,
drew 821,819 people _ down nearly 6 percent from last year.
   The Kentucky State Fair, which began Thursday, has 14 acres of
air-conditioned space, said spokeswoman Brenda Frank, who predicted
that teen-agers would be outdoors on the midway, whatever the
weather.
   ``I don't think they know how hot it is,'' she said. ``We won't
tell them that.''
   The too-hot, too-dry growing season was a disappointment for
some produce exhibitors, who ruefully displayed unusually small
contenders.
   Tony Misich of Clinton, Ohio, said the potatoes, cucumbers,
peppers and onions are the smallest from his garden he's shown in
10 years at the fair.
   ``This is sure disappointing _ you're not a-kiddin','' he said.
   Flowers also suffered.
   In Wisconsin, dahlia entries were down 50 percent, said fair
spokeswoman Julie Carlson.
   ``Those flowers were not out there blooming,'' she said. ``We
did have a lot of ribbons left over.''

   A Mercedes packed with explosives blew up
Sunday near a Syrian army checkpoint in Moslem west Beirut,
wounding 18 people and damaging cars and buildings, police said.
   No group immediately claimed of responsibility for the bombing
in the seaside Raouche district, which came during a confrontation
between pro-Syrian forces and hard-line pro-Israel Christians over
the election of a new president.
   The cream-colored Mercedes, packed with an estimated 88 pounds
of TNT, detonated at 8:40 a.m. only six feet from the checkpoint
opposite a fish restaurant, police said. It was not known whether
the bomb was detonated by remote control or a timing device.
   Police said three Syrian soldiers at the sandbagged checkpoint
were among the casualties. Most of the other wounded were Lebanese
civilians, including women and children.
   At least eight cars parked nearby were destroyed. The
restaurant's glass front was blown in and windows in several
neighboring buildings were shattered.
   Hours later, police said another car rigged with two rockets was
safely defused in south Beirut's seaside Ouzai district.
   The car was parked in front of a bakery about 50 yards from a
Syrian checkpoint. Police said the 107mm rockets were equipped with
a timing device but did not say when they were set to go off.
   Police said the Merecedes that exploded was parked Saturday
evening near the restaurant, atop a cliff overlooking the
Mediterranean on a winding hilltop road popular with morning
strollers.
   Several unexploded hand grenades and a mortar shell were found
in the wreckage of the car, police said.
   ``Had they exploded, it would have been a real disaster,'' said
a police officer at the scene who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Nervous Syrian troops armed with rocket-propelled grenades and
automatic rifles sealed off the blast scene, firing in the air to
make room for Red Cross ambulances rushing victims to hospitals.
   Glass shards from the Mayfair Casino and a string of oceanside
fish restaurants littered a radius of 150 yards around the blast
scene.
   ``I heard a powerful explosion that hurled me several meters.
Pieces of glass rained on me,'' said a 28-year-old casino employee
who declined to be named.
   The car bombing was the 11th in Lebanon this year. By police
count, 103 people have been killed and 353 wounded in the 10
previous car bombings.
   The attacks have been a byproduct of Lebanon's 13-year-old civil
war between Moslems and Christians, which has claimed more than
130,000 lives since it broke out in 1975.
   Fears of of a new outbreak of violence have been fueled by a
presidential election deadlock that threatens to create a power
vacuum after President Amin Gemayel's six-year term in office
expires Sept. 23.
   Christian hardliners backed by the Lebanese Forces, the nation's
main civil war militia, prevented the election of Syrian-backed
warlord Suleiman Franjieh Thursday by boycotting the election
session in parliament, blocking a quorum for a vote.

   While the Republicans almost certainly will be
blessed with a buoyant economy through Election Day, inflation and
rising interest rates could shove the country into a recession as
early as next spring, some economists are warning.
   A few analysts are forecasting a downturn for next year, and
many who aren't say it will take luck to avoid a recession.
   Ironically, one of the things that has them worried is that
economic growth has been so robust lately.
   A boom in U.S. export sales has helped push the nation's
unemployment rate down to 14-year lows.
   The gross national product has expanded at an annual rate of 3.1
percent during the first six months of the year and there are
indications that the economy may be growing even faster in the
current July-September quarter.
   This rapid growth in demand is beginning to push up against
supply restraints because of tight labor markets and high operating
rates in many industries.
   This often translates into rising inflationary pressures as
workers demand higher wages and businesses boost product prices.
   To nip inflation before it gets out of hand, the Federal Reserve
since late March has been pushing up interest rates to dampen
demand. Earlier this month, it boosted its discount rate one-half
percentage point to 6.5 percent.
   An increase in the discount rate is the most dramatic signal the
central bank can send of its inflation-fighting intentions.
   That is what worries economists. Most recessions in this country
are brought on by a credit squeeze. While the central bank doesn't
set out to create a downturn, it often finds it difficult to walk
the fine line between dampening demand to cool inflationary
pressures and tightening so much that a new recession is triggered.
   ``The famous soft-landing for the economy has proven very
difficult to manage in the past,'' said Robert Dederick, chief
economist for the Northern Trust Co. of Chicago.
   Dederick said he believed the current expansion, now in its
peacetime record 69th month, will head into a new slump by the end
of next year.
   Economists at the New York investment firm of Merrill Lynch said
in their latest forecast that growth could stall by next summer as
higher interest rates and a loss of export momentum take their toll.
   David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc., said next
spring will be the beginning of the danger time for the economy,
given the six to nine month lag between increases in interest rates
and their greatest impact on borrowing.
   ``We are forecasting that we will be able to avoid a recession
next year and just have a slowdown, but the risk of a recession is
certainly there if the Federal Reserve gets carried away with
tightening,'' he said.
   Under some optimistic scenarios, the expansion will moderate as
higher interest rates cut into consumer and business demand, but
strong export sales will provide a boost to manufacturing and
prevent a recession.
   Another theory sees inflation rising at a faster clip, forcing
the Fed to take stronger action which will send such key
interest-rate sensitive sectors as housing into a tailspin, with
the weakness then spreading to the rest of the economy.
   With mortgage rates climbing lately, the National Association of
Home Builders has already complained that the Fed's credit
tightening threatened to make the housing industry a ``sacrificial
lamb.''
   While the Reagan administration expressed its disappointment at
the Fed's recent discount rate hike, economists said the credit
tightening so far should not cause any appreciable slowdown before
the Nov. 8 election, good news for GOP presidential candidate
George Bush, who hopes continued signs of prosperity will translate
into votes.
   Michael Penzer, an economist with the Bank of America in San
Francisco, said he believed interest rates would keep rising until
next February, when the Fed would reverse course after seeing signs
that its tightening was having the desired effect of slowing GNP
growth.
   ``We have a fairly rosey scenario in which the Fed lucks out,''
he said.
   Economists who are not ready to write the obituary for the
expansion say the current recovery from the 1981-82 downturn has
proven remarkably resilient and may have a couple of more years of
life.
   ``This expansion has had nine lives,'' said Jerry Jasinowski,
chief economist of the National Association of Manufacturers. ``It
has rebounded from a flood of imports in the mid-1980s, high real
interest rates and the loss of $1 trillion of wealth during the
1987 stock market collapse.''

<HEAD>Third World Needs $90 Billion for Roads, Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Third World countries need $43 billion worth
of repairs to their roads, including many of their key
thoroughfares, because over the last decade they failed to spend
$12 billion or less to maintain them, the World Bank says in a
report.
   The largest sum _ $11 billion _ is needed in Latin America and
the Caribbean, followed by $9.3 billion in East Asia and the
Pacific, and another $9.3 billion in the poorer countries of the
Middle East, North Africa and Europe.
   The bank's experts said they were talking about a third of all
paved roads outside of towns and a quarter of the unpaved roads in
85 countries. They found that 40 percent of the paved roads will
need repair in the next 10 years, at a cost of another $40 billion.
   In 1984, the most recent year for which the report gives
figures, the countries concerned put out $6.5 billion for repair
and maintenance.
   ``But if these countries do not improve the management of roads,
the eventual cost of restoration could easily increase two- to
threefold, and the cost to users could rise even more,'' the report
warned.
   The World Bank, owned by 151 countries, is the biggest single
source of loans to help poor countries raise their living
standards. It has lent about $15.5 billion for roads since it was
founded at the end of World War II.
   Routine maintenance can cost as little as $480 a mile, while
rebuilding can cost more than $480,000 a mile, the report said.
   The experts found the hard core of the problem in southern
Africa. They took 61 Third World countries all over the world and
found that 16 of them had budgets too small to pay for the roads
they need. Of those 16, there were 11 where citizens' incomes have
been declining. Nine of the 11 are south of the Sahara.
   They found a different problem in China, India, Pakistan,
Bangladesh and Burma. Many of their roads were built long ago in
ways that do not suit today's traffic, and should simply be
replaced, the report said.

   It's beginning to look like a daily habit _ a man
in a white tuxedo hops out of a limousine and spends a couple of
minutes handing out $50 bills to passersby before being driven off.
   But on Saturday, there was a slight difference. This time, the
limo pulled up outside a Greektown bar, instead of grocery stores
in Detroit and Northville where apparently the same man appeared
Thursday and Friday.
   ``He was in and out in 30 seconds,'' said bar patron John Godin
of Belleville. ``At first I turned it (the money) down because I
didn't know what it was.''
   But, Godin had second thoughts and took one of the bills. It was
unclear how much money the man has given away.

   The bartender's dreaded cry of ``last orders''
will not ring out in English pubs Monday afternoon for the first
time since World War I.
   Instead, thanks to new laws that permit all-day drinking, pubs
that open at 11 a.m. can continue serving beer and spirits until
closing time at 11 p.m.
   ``We're hoping for a big crowd,'' said Mick McCoy, assistant
manager of the Hog In The Pound pub near the Oxford Street shopping
district. ``We're stacked up (with beer). We've taken on a couple
of extra people, just in case.''
   Other pub owners who have lost trade to fast-food restaurants
will expand their lunch menus. One even plans to sell tea and
scones.
   Under the old system, pubs were forced to close from 3 p.m.
until 5:30 p.m. The bartender's warning at 2:50 p.m. created a rush
for one last pint, and 10 minutes later, to the cry of ``time,
gentlemen, please,'' the fun was over.
   The government imposed the rule in 1915 to curb drinking by
munitions workers. Scotland went to all-day drinking in 1977, but
the restriction held in the 68,000 English and Welsh pubs until
Monday.
   The British Medical Association opposes the extended hours,
fearing increased alcohol-related illness and drunken-driving
accidents. But no increase in alcohol abuse or surge in consumption
was detected in Scotland.
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, the Cabinet minister responsible
for liquor laws, likened the old restriction to a ``corset, a
straitjacket, which has no particular rhyme or reason.''
   Parliament agreed, and voted overwhelmingly in April to do away
with the 2{-hour afternoon dry period on Monday through Saturday,
which has frustrated Britons and tourists alike.
   A controversial amendment slipped in by the unelected House of
Lords extends opening times by one hour on Sunday, which has always
had shorter drinking hours. Sunday hours were noon to 2 p.m. and 7
p.m. to 10:30 p.m. They are now noon to 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. to 10:30
p.m.
   Next to TV-gazing, dropping into the neighborhood pub is
Britain's most popular leisure activity, said Kenneth Dunjohn,
spokesman for the Brewers Society, representing most of Britain's
117 breweries.
   The pub is where neighbors, still more men than women,
congregate to play darts, work the slot machines and argue about
soccer and politics.
   It's also the original fast-food outlet. In addition to a
smorgasbord of beer, from light lagers to strong, dark ales, and
other alcohol, pubs serve traditional English food like
steak-and-kidney pie and bangers and mash.
   But pub attendance has been falling since 1979, when a recession
hit Britain's heavy industries and cut blue-collar spending power,
Dunjohn said.
   Faced with competition from fast-food chains and wine bars,
which arrived in Britain in the same period, the beer market has
gone flat.
   Beer consumption fell to 190 pints per capita a year in 1986
from 208 pints in 1976, although measured in terms of pure alcohol,
consumption rose to 9.2 liters in 1986 from six liters in 1966.
   Pub managers and breweries, which own or have exclusive sales
agreements with thousands of pubs, hope the new hours will
revitalize business.
   Pubs will expand their food service to meet the afternoon trade,
predicted Joe Boyle, marketing manager for brewers Ind Coope Taylor
Walker Ltd., which operates more than 700 pubs in London. The
British Tourist Authority expects 50,000 new jobs will be created
in pubs and the catering trade.
   The Sherlock Holmes pub near Trafalgar Square plans to serve
full cream teas _ scones, strawberry jam, the works _ every
afternoon.
   ``As far as I can see, the house (pub) will be more of a coffee
shop in the afternoon than a drinking house,'' said John Williams,
who manages the pub with his wife, Jean. ``I don't think the
average British person, after the initial shock, is going to be
affected. It's more of a touristy thing.''
   Only those pubs in busy tourist or commercial areas are expected
to take advantage of the new hours, while those in residential
areas will continue to close in the afternoon.
   The National Association of Licensed House Managers, which
represents 13,000 pub managers, had feared increased overhead costs
would push up beer prices if all pubs had to open in the afternoon.
   Beer prices have risen three to four pence (5 cents) recently,
but the breweries insist it's not because of the new hours. The
going price for a pint of beer is 85 pence ($1.50).

   The hills of Massachusetts are alive
again with the sounds of polkas, waltzes and military marches as
town bands make a comeback in once-abandoned band shells and
gazebos.
   Retired musicians, teen-agers and middle-age mothers who haven't
played an instrument since high school are jumping on the bandwagon.
   ``You have no idea how much fun it is,'' said Roger Voisin, a
former first trumpet of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and a
third-generation town band musician. His grandfather conducted the
municipal band in the French city of Angers.
   The legacy continues. Voisin's 15-year-old granddaughter,
Jennifer Roy, sits behind him in the Great Barrington band shell
that was built last year to replace the 1904 bandstand that had
disappeared from its spot in front of Town Hall in the 1940s.
   ``Every once in a while I'll do a solo or a particularily
difficult piece and I'll feel a little pat on my back, as if to
say, `Good job, Grandpa,''' he said.
   Band shells sprung up in parks across the United States in the
1800s, but fell victim to radio, movie theaters and television sets
in the middle of this century. Several band shells were destroyed;
others simply were abandoned.
   One of the few towns that managed to keep the tradition going
despite the lure of other pasttimes was Shelburne Falls, which
boasts the second-oldest continuously operating town band in the
nation. The band has played every summer since its founding in 1835.
   Its secretary, Shirley Donelson, believes the band may be the
oldest.
   The 30-member Shelburne Falls Military Band includes one player
with at least a half-century of service and three players with more
than 40 years in the group. Among the players are a farmer, a
retired fire chief, a college music professor and a few high school
students.
   The band even has uniforms, a luxury among most bands. The
40-member Montague Community Band provides shirts but asks that
musicians bring their own chairs.
   Mrs. Donelson, 54, said she took up the saxophone she had left
behind in high school and joined the band as soon as her children
grew up. ``I didn't have time when I was raising a family,'' she
said.
   Her husband, Walt, 55, has beat the bass drum for the group
every summer since 1952. A carpenter, he designed and built the
town band shell in 1970.
   ``I do it for the fun of it,'' he said. ``If I did it for the
money, I'd be done years ago.''
   Like all town bands, the Shelburne Falls band depends mostly on
the generosity of the board of selectmen to keep going, but it also
raises money by charging fees for marching in other communities.
   The 50-member Pulaski Brass Band in Webster celebrated its 99th
year on Aug. 14 by marching a few blocks from its headquarters, the
Polish American Citizens' Club, to St. Joseph's Church, where it
was started by five men.
   The band has missed only a few summers, during World War II,
since its beginning and has never had trouble recruiting, members
say.
   ``We have no dues and no auditions,'' Walter Motyka, a 37-year
veteran of the group, told The Worcester Telegram. ``We had a
fellow once who really had no musical ability, so we let him crash
the cymbals.''

<TEXT>
   The retreat of Contra rebels and
supporters to remote Honduran base camps threatens the survival of
the insurgency to oust Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.
   The action also reverses months of political and military
advances.
   Officials at the rebel camps said more than 14,000 Contra troops
and civilians crossed the Coco River border in the past four months
into Yamales in the steep Honduran mountains. Rebel officers
estimate that no more than 2,000 fighters remain in the northern
Nicaraguan hills.
   The rebels blame the withdrawal on the United States, which on
Feb. 29 cut off military aid _ a bargaining chip, they say, for
discussions to end the war that began in 1981. Congress has voted
to grant only non-lethal aid distributed in Honduras.
   ``Our forces can't stay in Nicaragua _ surrounded by Sandinista
troops _ without bullets in their rifles,'' Enrique Bermudez, the
rebel commander and member of the Contra political directorate,
said recently. ``Military aid must be a threat to the Sandinistas
to continue negotiating. We need to convince Congress we enter from
a position of strength.''
   Thousands of troops, many in new U.S. Army uniforms, wait at the
base camps, occasionally falling into formation. They buoy each
other's morale, playing baseball and checkers on homemade boards
with toothpaste caps. Makeshift tents of wood stakes covered with
plastic or ponchos dot the hillsides.
   The population of the refugee camps swelled from 8,000 at the
start of 1987 to more than 13,000 at the end of June. Honduras
claims that up to 200,000 Nicaraguans live illegally in its
territory.
   At one of the camps, new arrivals, their clothes tattered from
more than a month of walking, worked under the tropical sun to
clear the brush. Many of the civilians said they followed the
troops because they would suffer Sandinista repression without
Contra protection.
   ``If we had aid, all our troops would be inside Nicaragua,''
said a 37-year-old Contra official whose nom de guerre is Commander
Johnson. ``It will take a long time to get back to where we were.''
   The first Contras came from the ranks of the national guard
under dictator Anastasio Somoza, who was ousted in a 1979
revolutionary war that brought the Sandinisatas to power. A dozen
rebels received training in Argentina in 1981 and others were
taught by CIA-contracted Argentine instructors at Honduran base
camps. The CIA was also held responsible for air drops of weapons,
food and other supplies.
   The Contras' reputation as an unsavory band of ragtag thugs
whose troops murdered civilians and kidnapped youths began changing
in 1986. Peasants and young people joined their ranks, which
swelled above 10,000.
   Congress approved a $100 million military and humanitarian aid
package in June 1986. By the following spring, the rebels,
well-armed and many trained in the United States, moved out of
their Honduran base camps into Nicaragua.
   The Sandinistas accused the Contras of forcing recruitment and
of a record number of human rights abuses.
   Asked about the abuses, Johnson acknowledged: ``There are still
revenge killings by both sides, but it's not a policy of our
organization.''
   The rebels had their greatest battlefield and political gains
against the Soviet-backed Sandinista government in 1987. They
became more popular when the government drew increasing criticism
for the failing economy, mandatory recruitment and repression.
   But the rebel advances of last year suffered setbacks in recent
months.
   In a surprise move three weeks after U.S. military aid ended
Feb. 29, the Sandinistas and the Contra civilian directorate signed
an agreement to seek a negotiated settlement to the war.
   The cease-fire plan prohibited the fighters from receiving any
militery aid, but allowed non-lethal supplies to be distributed
inside Nicaragua by a neutral international organization.
   Congress, citing the pact, withheld further military aid and in
March allocated $15.5 million for supplies ranging from food to
uniforms and $17.7 million for medical aid to child war victims.
The supplies were to be distributed in Honduras by the U.S. Agency
for International Development.
   At about the same time, deep divisions emerged among the rebels.
   Some Contra commanders who signed the peace plan charged
commander-in-chief Enrique Bermudez with corruption and called for
a barracks uprising.
   The dissidents were purged and the troops rallied around
Bermudez, who opposed the cease-fire.
   Bermudez, a former colonel in Somoza's national guard, was
elected in July to the seven-member Contra political directorate
and was said to have resigned his post as the military
commander-in-chief. However, he clearly remains in control.
   Bermudez, who recently visited the camps, listened as soldiers
complained about the diet of rice and beans. Many of the ew
arrivals are to start military training in September, while some of
the civilians and fighters will head for nearby refugee camps run
by the United Nations.
   But rebel officials said thousands of other fighters and
civilians were expected to cross the border into Honduras soon.
   Felix Mendoza, a Honduran farmer who allows the Contras to use
his land, said ``incredible numbers'' of rebels had entered in
recent days.
   ``Nicargua will soon be empty,'' said Mendoza.
   Bermudez called the cutoff of American aid ``a tragedy for
Central America'' and said he will seek support from other
governments or private donors.
   Commander Augustin, 29, a company leader who has been fighting
for seven years, said: ``I didn't want to come back here. We still
have some bullets but we needed clothes, boots and food.''
   ``We're willing to fight until the last drop of blood. We want
liberty in our country,'' said the officer.

   Death may be a constant but the rituals
change with the times, as a museum dedicated to dying and
bereavement illustrates.
   Old embalming tools, a 1917 Ford Model-T hearse that doubled as
an ambulance, intricately braided wreaths of human hair and a
1,500-pound glass casket are some of the memorabilia in Fred
Hunter's funeral museum, one of a handful in the United States.
   ``If we can teach a little to a student, and help families
understand the history, that death is natural ... this helps them
understand there's a heritage to this process. The whole funeral
process is a part of growing, of letting go,'' said Hunter.
   Hunter is president of National Selected Morticians, a
965-member trade group.
   A third-generation funeral director and antique enthusiast,
Hunter inherited some displays from his father and grandfather.
After he bought a large collection in 1986, there was no longer
room to show them off at his business. The museum opened last year
next to Hunter's funeral home.
   The 1,200 visitors have included mourners who stopped by after a
funeral, tourists who have stumbled upon it and students from local
high schools or community colleges.
   ``A lot of times, people sitting here will see the museum and
we'll open it for them. It answers a lot of questions,'' said Steve
Plescia, grief counselor at Hunter's.
   Learning funeral history is a good way to brace for the future,
said Roberta Halporn, director of the New York City-based Center
for Thanatology Research and Education, a non-profit group that
studies dying, death and grieving.
   ``This is a death-denying culture. So when it happens, the pain
is almost double. People without experience tend to want to
eliminate everything _ no funeral. But each part of the ritual has
significance,'' she said.
   ``When these rituals are established and practiced, it starts
the bereavement process going in a healthy way,'' Halporn said.
   South Florida career guidance teacher Kay Anderson agrees. She
has taken Piper High School students considering allied health
careers on field trips to Hunter's for years.
   ``As weird as it sounds, it really is a good learning
experience. Part of managing a career is understanding death. It's
a good thing, because kids at this age have no experience with
death,'' she says.
   For Hunter, the museum reflects the changes in American culture.
``The way funerals changed mirrors the way families changed.''
   At the turn of the century funerals were still family reunions.
Morticians visited homes to prepare the body, often laid out in
parlors, and built made-to-measure coffins.
   ``On the day of the funeral, he would come again with his coffin
and put the body in it and go to the church,'' Hunter said.
   As people moved to cities, wakes moved out of houses and funeral
homes were born.
   Coffins used to be tapered on the ends and their inner metal
liners were soldered. They are no longer tapered and now have
self-sealing rubber gaskets.
   During the Victorian era, wreaths were fashioned from hair,
generally that of the deceased, and a family might weave a huge
multi-hued wreath over several generations.
   Hearses once regularly doubled as ambulances, a practice that
ended with regulations that ambulances be painted white. That was
hardly appropriate for a funeral vehicle, Hunter said, stroking his
gleaming black Model-T, which won first prize _ as an ambulance _
at the Antique Automotive Club of America's 1982 show.
   Not all industry innovations caught on, like the solid glass
casket on display.
   ``You take the 1,500 pounds and add another 175 pounds and we
put that in a Model-T hearse and you've just flattened the tires,''
Hunter said. ``It's like one giant Coke bottle.''
   Other funeral museums around the nation include a small display
owned by T.J. Beggs and Sons Funeral Home of Madison, near
Tallahassee, and a traveling museum run by the Illinois Funeral
Director's Association of Springfield.
   Hunter's museum also houses a collection of 1900-era anatomy
books for student morticians, yellowing funeral bills and complete
issues of the trade journal ``The Casket'' dating back to 1892.
   Hunter sees industry changes ahead, such as more cremations,
people paying for funerals in advance and the terminally ill opting
to die in their own beds instead of in hospitals.
   ``The death pattern is changing,'' he said. ``We go to homes
more often than we did five years ago.''

   A mother who won a two-year fight to enroll
her 6-year-old AIDS-afflicted daughter in school finds her victory
bittersweet.
   ``This is the closest Eliana has been to a classroom. But I
can't send her to school to sit in a cage,'' Rosa Martinez said.
   The 36-year-old licensed practical nurse has struggled to give
her daughter, who weighed 10 pounds when she was adopted at about
11 months, a home and medical care. Now she's fighting for an
education for Eliana.
   Mrs. Martinez is appealing a ruling by U.S. District Judge
Elizabeth Kovachevich allowing Eliana to start school Aug. 29,
provided she remains behind a glass partition, isolated from other
children in the classroom.
   Her attorney expects it to become a landmark case.
   ``The issues in this case involve critically important national
policy,'' said Steve Hanlon, who is taking the case to the 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta. ``It's going to have
long-lasting precedential effects.''
   Ms. Kovachevich ruled that Eliana, who is retarded, may attend
Manhattan Exceptional Center, a school for disabled children. But
the judge spelled out restrictions.
   In the classroom, Eliana must stay isolated inside a specially
built glass booth until she is toilet-trained and stops sucking her
fingers. Other children may play with her only if their parents
sign consent forms.
   The enclosure, located toward the back of the room, must be
8-by-10 feet with a large plexiglass window and sound system. It's
to have a toilet and desk. An aide would be assigned to Eliana full
time.
   Hillsborough County school officials fought attempts to admit
Eliana to the classroom. They feared she might transmit to others
the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus through bodily fluids.
   However, the judge wrote, no AIDS cases have been proved to have
been transmitted through exposure to urine, feces or saliva even
though the virus that causes the disease has been found in these
bodily secretions.
   AIDS, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control, is
spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes
shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from
pregnant women to their offspring.
   For the past year, a teacher has come to Eliana's home an hour a
day; school officials wanted to continue that method of instruction.
   But Mrs. Martinez and Hanlon insisted that Eliana needed to be
with other children.
   In her Aug. 8 ruling, Ms. Kovachevich said she was trying to
address the concerns of both sides.
   Even though Mrs. Martinez says she won't send Eliana to school
next week, school officials are building an $8,000 glass enclosure.
The plumbing is already finished.
   When Mrs. Martinez first heard the judge's ruling she started to
cry. ``I was angry and confused,'' she said in an interview last
week.
   ``I said to myself, `There's no way I'm going to do that, see
her behind a cage watching other children and wanting to get out
and play with them.' Then there was the confusion, the fear. I
thought is this the only way we're going to be able to do it?''
   Hanlon quoted pediatric and psychological experts as saying the
classroom restrictions would be harmful to Eliana and could put
even more stress on her weak immune system.
   Hillsborough school board member and former teacher Marion
Rodgers called the booth ``cruel.''
   ``If we did this in any other school setting for any other
reason, the courts would have us there for child abuse,'' she said.
   Mrs. Martinez adopted Eliana after she responded to a radio
appeal in Puerto Rico for a baby living at a hospital.
   Doctors believe that Eliana, born prematurely, was exposed to
AIDS when she had multiple transfusions as an infant.
   She has been on the AIDS-fighting drug AZT for the past year and
her mother says she has improved noticeably over the last several
months. The child's homebound teacher confirms that.
   ``She was deprived of family and we became that. She was
deprived of health and we gave her the best medical attention we
could,'' Mrs. Martinez says. ``Now, I don't want her deprived of an
education. She needs more than an hour a week to progress. And she
needs friends.''

<HEAD>Anniversary Rekindles Interest in Hatfiled-McCoy Feud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOGAN, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One hundred years after the Hatfield-McCoy
feud ended, West Virginia is embroiled in a polite debate on the
propriety of cashing in on the bloodshed.
   Guides at Chief Logan State Park led three-hour tours of Feudin'
Country during a weeklong festival that ended Sunday. The show
included films, slide shows, music and souvenirs.
   ``This part of the state doesn't have high mountains and
waterfalls, but we do have the most interesting history,'' said
Alvin Gale, a park ranger who leads the tours. ``It's not something
to be proud of, but it is history.''
   ``I guess things had to be settled one way or another,'' said
Liz Clay, 66, who went on one of the tours last week. ``That's
life, honey. To know what went on years ago.''
   At least 14 people died in the feud that pitted the McCoy clan
of Pike County, Ky., against the Hatfield clan of Logan County,
W.Va., part of which is now Mingo County.
   No one knows what prompted the bloodshed. Speculation centers on
a stolen hog and a Romeo-and-Juliet romance between two members of
the families. Whatever set it off, it took the intervention of the
governors of two states to bring peace in 1888.
   The tour covers five cemeteries, two dilapidated houses, one
battle site and some papaw bushes at the site where three McCoy
brothers were slain by the Hatfields.
   Only one Kentucky cemetery is included, and some Kentuckians
have half-jokingly accused the guides of slanting the tour toward
West Virginia. State officials say they left out Kentucky sites
because they were too far away.
   While many revel in the homespun notoriety, some historians
contend that reviving the Hatfield-McCoy feud perpetuates ugly
stereotypes of Appalachians.
   ``To me, it's very sad for this to be a commercial thing. It's
playing on a stereotype which I don't like,'' said Altina L.
Waller, a former history professor at West Virginia University
whose book, ``Feud: Hatfields, McCoys and Social Change in
Appalachia, 1860-1900,'' recently was published by the University
of North Carolina press.
   ``On the other hand, it's sort of coming to terms with
history,'' Waller said.
   The publicity, which pops up frequently in national magazines
and newspapers, may hurt the area more than help it, said Ron
Eller, director of the Appalachian Center at the University of
Kentucky.
   ``There's probably been few other things in Appalachian history
that have reflected more of the negative stereotype as the
Hatfield-McCoy feud,'' Eller said. ``The national imagery is that
they were backwoods, isolated mountain farmers. In reality, they
were very important families who competed for land access that
would lead to economic development.''
   The tours in West Virginia are spurring some interest in Pike
County, where the Preservation Council of Pike County wants to
arrange similar tours. Sites would include the remnants of the
house where the stolen hog trial was held; the place where a
Hatfield supporter was hanged; and the grave of Randolph McCoy,
patriarch of the McCoy clan.
   ``Since it is an internationally known part of our heritage, we
need to capitalize on it,'' said Betsy Venters, the council's
president. ``It's something that the present generation wants to
know more about.''
   Pike County Judge-Executive Paul Patton isn't so sure.
   ``The Hatfield-McCoy feud is one thing that most people are
aware of. I guess people hold on to that as one thing that might
grow into a significant tourist industry,'' he said. But ``it
certainly might not promote the type of image we want.''

   With the cause of their deaths still shrouded
in mystery, the bodies of Ambassador Arnold L. Raphel and Brig.
Gen. Herbert M. Wassom were returned from Pakistan on Sunday with
full military honors and tributes from two Cabinet members.
   As grieving family members watched the flag-draped coffins which
pallbearers carried past a 19-man military cordon, Secretary of
State George P. Shultz called Raphel and Wassom ``two of our best''
and said the nation is ``better and safer'' because of their
sacrifice.
   ``As professionals and patriots, they were committed to the
inseparable principles needed for success: a readiness to engage
with others diplomatically to reach agreement and a readiness to
apply strength in the interests of a safer world,'' Shultz said.
   The 15-minute ceremony at Andrews Air Force Base, Md., occurred
four days after the Pakistani C-130 aircraft in which they were
flying crashed 330 miles south of Islamabad, claiming the lives of
President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq and 29 others.
   Shultz delayed a long-planned vacation to travel to Islamabad
for the funeral service Saturday for Zia, perhaps the closest U.S.
ally in the Islamic world.
   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci told mourners at the airbase
outside Washington that Wassom ``paid the ultimate price'' for the
defense of his country and ``helped make the world a safer place
for all of us.''
   Raphel was one of the most experienced U.S. diplomats on
southwest Asian affairs. Wassom was the senior U.S. defense
official in Pakistan.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman refused to speculate
on the cause of the crash because investigators, including U.S.
experts flown to Pakistan, are just beginning their work.
   But acting Pakistani President Ghulam Ishaq Khan said Saturday
his government suspects sabotage.
   ``Judging from the circumstances of the tragedy ... enemies of
Pakistan are actively posing a threat to the security of our
country,'' Ishaq Khan said.
   During his 11-year rule, Zia acquired many enemies because of
his authoritarian rule, and there were at least two abortive
military coups seeking his ouster.
   One U.S. official, who spoke only on condition that he not be
identified, said a Soviet-trained and organized Afghanistan
intelligence service has to be ``among the suspects'' because of
its alleged role in carrying out terrorist acts in Pakistan.
   The official noted Zia's strong support for Afghan rebels
fighting the pro-Soviet government in Kabul.
   The airport ceremony took place in the shadow of the Air Force
jet that returned the remains of Wassom and Raphel, both of whom
had served in Pakistan for a little more than a year.
   Dozens of government officials and family members were on hand
for the solemn homecoming, the first of its kind involving a U.S.
ambassador since the February 1979 death of the ambassador Adolph
Dubs, who died in Afghanistan.
   Shultz said Raphel and Wassom were in the front line of the
struggle for values that Americans hold dear.
   ``Arnie and Herb went halfway around the world to join the fight
for these great causes, not just for others but for America,'' he
said. ``If we do not work to shape a world in freedom, peace,
prosperity and justice, then here at home those principles will be
endangered and could be lost.''
   Raphel's widow, Nancy Ely, a former State Department official,
walked hand in hand with Shultz as they left the plane. In addition
to his parents and a brother, Raphel, 45, also is survived by
Stephanie, a 19-year old daughter by a previous marriage.
   Wassom, 49, is survived by his wife, Judy, and two children,
Tara and Doug.
   A funeral service will be held Monday at Fort Meyer, a nearby
Army post, with burial in Arlington National Cemetery.

   Academy Award-winning actress
Joan Fontaine has turned activist over a neighbor's plan to build a
200-square-foot guest house addition.
   Fontaine, 71, has entered the limelight in this small village
five miles south of Carmel with her objections that center on what
she characterizes as an invasion of privacy.
   ``It really is a shanty, isn't it,'' said Fontaine, raised in
Saratoga and best known for her roles in 1940s films such as
``Rebecca,'' ``Suspicion'' and ``Jane Eyre.''
   ``It would loom up in my garden,'' she said. ``It would be hell,
but I'm afraid they're going to let it happen.''
   Fontaine, also known for a longtime rivalry with sister Olivia
de Havilland, recently led visitors on a tour of her grounds on
Villa Fontana, the celebrity's home with a million-dollar view of
Point Lobos.
   San Mateo surgeon Gerald Jegge and his wife, Doncha, bought the
property in 1986. They plan to retire there in September and want
to renovate the guest house for their children, grandchildren and
friends.
   The county has approved the plans. Their Carmel attorney, James
G. Heisinger, said the couple doesn't understand the whole fuss.
   ``It's a nothing project,'' Heisinger said. ``The reason behind
the opposition is Joan Fontaine. Why she objects so strenuously, I
don't know. They're not moving in a rock band.''
   Fontaine remains steadfast in her opposition.
   ``The bone of contention is, it's practically inside my house,''
she said, adding with a sweep of her hand, ``I can see it now.
Grandchildren. Motorcycles. Rock 'n' roll. I can't stand anything
but Beethoven and Bach.''

   Director Martin Scorsese says critics of his film,
``The Last Temptation of Christ,'' have misinterpreted the scene in
which Jesus imagines making love to Mary Magdalene.
   Some conservative Christian leaders have denounced the film,
saying it reinterprets the Bible. Thousands of people protested
when ``Last Temptation'' opened two weeks ago to packed houses in
seven U.S. cities and two in Canada.
   Scorsese said the film's most controversial scene, in which a
crucified Jesus hallucinates having sex with Mary Magdalene, should
not offend viewers when taken ``in context.''
   ``That is the very last temptation of Christ, to forego his
divinity and become merely human. In the dream, Christ imagines a
full human life with a marriage to Mary Magdalene and a family of
children,'' Scorsese said in an interview published Sunday in The
Observer newspaper.
   ``The temptation is not to have sex, but to get married, make
love to your wife and have children like an ordinary man,'' he said.
   In the film Jesus rejects this final temptation.

   A half-dozen billboards featuring the
signature of Glen Campbell in an Arizona tourism campaign will be
taken down because of the country singer's behind-the-scenes role
in a state political race.
   Campbell's signature and those of other celebrities were
included in the ``Do Az. I Do'' promotional series, said state
Tourism Director Victor Heller.
   But Heller said he feared the public might confuse Campbell's
opinions for those of the state. Campbell is supporting a
conservative Republican seeking a seat in the Arizona House of
Representatives.
   ```Do Az. I Do' could be interpreted to mean (do as I do)
outside the tourism arena,'' Heller said.
   The billboards in question may stay up another 10 days, he said.
The promotion is scheduled to end in September, when the billboards
featuring other personalities also will come down, said Jay Taylor
of Taylor Advertising.
   Campbell has an unlisted telephone number and could not be
reached for comment.

   Singer Willie Nelson says he is angry that the
president of Baylor University canceled his benefit concert at the
school's new events center in Waco.
   ``They do really make me mad when they tell me I can't play in
Waco. Waco's my hometown. It gets my red Irish hair up,'' Nelson
told the Houston Chronicle Friday from his hotel in Beverly Hills,
Calif. ``Some pressure was applied or maybe the guy felt
sanctimonious, like his hallowed hall was too good for me to play
in.''
   Nelson, a country singer and movie star who is no stranger to
trouble, said his concert promoter, Tom Gresham, was told by Baylor
president Herbert Reynolds that the concert was canceled this week
because of protests that Nelson's concerts have drawn from some
police groups.
   His concerts in Rhode Island were picketed last month by police
who objected to Nelson's benefit last year for an American Indian
convicted of killing a federal officer. The officers stopped
picketing after Nelson promised to do a benefit for both Indian and
police causes.
   To keep the new benefit alive, Nelson has made arrangements to
move the concert to the Heart O'Texas Coliseum, a county-owned
arena. The concert will benefit residents of Leroy, Texas, trying
to recoup money lost in a bank closure.

   Conductor Herbert von Karajan, who is
suffering from serious circulatory problems, has canceled two
appearances at the Salzburg Festival, the Salzburg press office
said Sunday.
   Von Karajan, 80, on Friday suffered what was described as a
massive circulatory weakness ``of a dangerous extent,'' which was
officially attributed to extremely hot weather and the fact that
the orchestra pit of the Festival House has no air-conditioning.
   Hans Widrich, the Salzburg Festival's press chief, said von
Karajan was resting at his home at Anif outside Salzburg.
   Von Karajan's assistant, Bruno Weil, will take over musical
direction of the opera ``Don Gionvanni'' on Monday and Aug. 28,
festival officials said.

   The Olympic Games don't open until next month, but
illustrator Bart Forbes has already won some artistic gold medals.
   The U.S. Postal Service chose designs submitted by Forbes for
both the 1988 Winter and Summer Olympic commemoratives. The summer
stamp, which depicts a male gymnast, was issued Friday at the U.S.
Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colo.
   In addition, Forbes, whose realistic depictions have graced the
covers of Time, Sports Illustrated and dozens of other magazines,
has been chosen by the Korean Olympic Committee as the official
artist of the summer games.
   Forbes, 49, was commissioned to finish 12 paintings before he
leaves for Seoul next month. He will paint about 20 more for a
museum that will commemorate the games.
   A golfer and sometime-tennis player, Forbes says he's not an
athlete, but his studio in a renovated century-old two-story
building in Dallas' arts district is trimmed with old baseballs,
hats and other sports paraphernalia.
   ``Sports is a subject matter I like to do,'' Forbes said,
calling the Olympics assignment a career highlight. ``It's fun.
It's exciting and timely.''
   Timely but not dated. Forbes believes well done art is timeless.
   ``I don't want to get caught doing finish-line illustrations,''
Forbes said of the typical sporting event depiction.
   ``The crux for any painter or illustrator is not being satisfied
with the first or most obvious solution,'' he said. The challenge,
he continued, is to portray the human spirit of the games, how
athletes respond to enormous pressure, for instance.
   ``Many of the athletes train four years for just one shot. It's
an incredible event. Sure, there are some who are just glad they
made it to the Olympics, but for so many they're there for only one
thing: a gold medal.''
   An art graduate of the University of North Carolina, Forbes
earned an advanced degree at the Art Center in Los Angeles. Unsure
of his ability to break into the New York design industry, Forbes
settled in Dallas for several years after school.
   Later, after spending five years in New York, Forbes returned
with his family to Dallas. He said he's lucky to be able to live
where he wants and work on a ``national scale.''
   Forbes paints with a simple realism he says is influenced by the
American artists Thomas Eakins and Winslow Homer, among others.
   The KOC commission was something of a coincidence.
   When the United States Sports Academy in Mobile, Ala., honored
Forbes as its sports artist of the year in 1987, he shared the
graduate school's spotlight with Korean Olympic Committee president
Chong Ha Kim.
   A few weeks after that meeting, Kim told Forbes he'd been chosen
the committee's official artist and invited him to Seoul for a week
to make preparations.
   Forbes' first 12 paintings, based on that visit, will be part of
a calendar the KOC will sell during the Olympics, which begin
September 17.
   In all, Forbes will create an original work depicting each
Olympic event as well as the opening and closing ceremonies.

   Jean-Paul Aron, a philosopher and self-proclaimed
``dandy'' who announced last year he was suffering from AIDS, has
died at the age of 61, hospital officials said.
   ``Nothing in the world would have made me talk publicly about my
homosexuality,'' if he had not contracted AIDS, Aron said recently.
   Officials at Claude Bernard hospital would not disclose the
details of the illness that led to Aron's death Saturday morning.
   In an interview on French television, Aron said he felt an
obligation to break the ``taboo'' surrounding acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, which attacks the body's immune system.
   AIDS is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.
   ``The silence about this illness must be broken,'' he said.
``The intellectual, whose duty is to truth, can recount better than
others the great stakes for society that surround this illness.''
   Aron, a nephew of the late French philosopher Raymond Aron,
taught philosphy at the universities of Tourcoing and Lille, wrote
books on the sociology of the 19th century, published novels,
produced plays and wrote for the newspapers Le Matin and Le Monde.
   He said that ``dandyism'' was the perfect word to describe his
approach to life.
   ``Dandyism is the apotheosis of the different,'' he said in an
interview with the magazine Nouvel Observateur. ``It is the tragedy
of the dandy, whose solution is in death.''

   Dale Robertson, the rugged star of Western
films and television series, decided to leave his cowboy hat back
at the bunkhouse when he was inducted into the Western Walk of Fame.
   ``It's so big, it blocks people's view,'' he said Saturday.
``Then I have to put it on the floor and it gets dirty. There isn't
any sun in here anyway. What in the hell do I need a big hat for?''
   Robertson was honored along with Doug McClure and the late Hoot
Gibson at a ceremony that drew 600 Western buffs and some past
inductees, who celebrated wwith a barbecue and square dance.
   The Western Walk, on San Fernando Road between 5th and 9th
streets in Newhall, was started in 1981 by merchant Milt Diamond as
a celebration of Newhall's Western heritage.
   The walk is modeled after the famous Hollywood Walk of Fame, in
which star's names are imbeddeded in the sidewalk.
   Robertson, who appeared in television's ``Tales of Wells
Fargo,'' ``The Iron Horse'' and the recent ``J.J. Starbuck,'' and
such Western films as ``Hell Canyon Outlaws,'' ``The Outcasts of
Poker Flats,'' and ``Sitting Bull'' borrowed a line Saturday from a
film he wasn't in.
   ``Frankly, Scarlett, I don't give a damn!'' he bellowed,
explaining later that Clark Gable's line from ``Gone With The
Wind'' was intended to be no insult for the Walk.
   ``I'm just glad to be honored for anything,'' he said.

<HEAD>Diplomat: Up To 3,000 Killed In Ethnic Violence In Burundi</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ethnic clashes in northern Burundi last
week left about 3,000 people dead and sent at least 16,000 fleeing
across the border to escape the bloodbath, a diplomat said Sunday.
   ``The facts are very, very sketchy because of the remoteness of
the area and the nature of the thing itself,'' said the diplomat,
who is based in the tiny Central African country and who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``But there has been no major violence
since the first 24 hours.''
   Previous reports said that several thousand people were killed,
but the diplomat was the first official to give a specific figure.
The earlier reports also said that only 7,000 Burundians fled their
country.
   The fighting began Aug. 14 between the Hutu, Burundi's majority
tribe, and the Tutsi, the minority tribe that controls the military
and rules the country.
   ``The majority of the victims were Tutsi,'' said the diplomat,
who was reached by telephone in Bujumbura, the Burundi capital.
   One media report, quoting an anonymous source, said 24,000 were
killed, but the diplomat called that figure ``extremely
exaggerated.''
   By Friday, at least 16,000 Burundians _ Hutu and Tutsi _ had
fled into neighboring Rwanda, the diplomat said.
   A 7 p.m.-5 a.m. curfew was clamped on Burundi. Meetings of more
than five people and travel between towns were banned.
   The government blamed the trouble on outsiders.
   ``We suspect that some former Hutu refugees infiltrated the
country from from foreign countries. They incited the Hutu
population and called on them to massacre the Tutsi population,''
Astere Nzisabira, Burundi's ambassador to Belgium, said last week.
   The two tribes are longtime enemies. After an abortive coup
attempt in 1972 in the former Belguim colony, the Tutsis responded
by massacring 100,000 Hutu, including most of the tribe's
intelligentsia.
   Burundi, with nearly 5 million people crammed into an area about
the size of Maryland, is one of Africa's most densely populated
countries. Eighty-four percent of its people are Hutu, while 15
percent are Tutsis.
   In the northern area where last week's violence occurred, the
Hutu account for more than 90 percent of the population.
   Most of the killings occurred near two communes known as
Marangara and Ntega. Burundi is mostly rural and people reside in
such communes. ``It's mostly hillsides covered with houses,'' the
diplomat said of the area.
   Peace was restored to the region within a day after the army
moved in, the government said.
   The Hutu People Liberation Party, an exiled opposition group,
charged in Belgium that the Tutsi-dominated military had massacred
thousands of Hutu. But the diplomatic source said there was no
evidence of that.
   Ethnic struggles have plagued Burundi since independence from
Belguim in 1962. For generations, the tall, lanky Tutsi held the
short, stocky Hutu in feudal serfdom.
   In 1976, Col. Jean-Baptiste Bagaza mounted a bloodless coup that
ousted Michel Micombero, who had sanctioned the Hutu slaughter four
years earlier. Bagaza, like Micombero, was a Tutsi.
   Bagaza was overthrown in a bloodless coup Sept. 4, by Maj.
Pierre Buyoya, a Tutsi who pledged to resolve ethnic differences.

<HEAD>Government Seeks To Strengthen Residential Segregation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ The government plans to push ahead
with tough new measures that would strengthen residential
segregation, despite critics who say the proposals are ``straight
out of the darkest ages of apartheid.''
   Members of Parliament meet Monday in Cape Town to debate a bill
aimed at tightening enforcement of the Group Areas Act, which
segregates all neighborhoods by race.
   Black activists, white businessmen and even the pro-government
newspaper Beeld have condemned the measure, saying it entrenches
apartheid and would force the evictions of thousands of blacks
living peacefully, but illegally, in ``whites only'' areas.
   The proposed Group Areas Amendment Bill would make it easier to
confiscate property and to evict and prosecute people living in
areas not designated for their race group.
   ``It is a wicked, wicked, bill,'' said Robin Carlisle of the
anti-apartheid Progressive Federal Party. ``It will drive decent
people out of their homes.''
   The bill calls for hiring inspectors to check for violations of
the law. The maximum fine for property owners who allow a person to
live outside his group area would increase from about $165 to
$4,100. The maximum prison sentence would be increased from two
years to five years.
   South Africa has a surplus of housing in white neighborhoods,
but a severe shortage in black areas. Thousands of non-whites have
been moving into white areas such as Hillbrow in Johannesburg and
Woodstock in Cape Town in recent years.
   The government has not strictly enforced the 35-year-old Group
Areas Act, angering conservative whites opposed to integrated
neighborhoods.
   The issue of segregated neighborhoods is one of the hottest
topics in the campaign for nationwide municipal elections Oct. 26,
and the bill is seen as an accommodation to right-wing whites.
   President P.W. Botha said last week he believes segregated
housing is favored by 80 percent of whites, 70 percent of Asians
and people of mixed race and a majority of blacks.
   ``It is rubbish to say 70 percent of our people would support
the (Group Areas) Act,'' said Allan Hendrickse, leader of the
mixed-race chamber of Parliament. ``Mr. Botha is this country's
most dangerous liability. It is about time he stepped down to make
way for a person of greater vision and perception.''
   Lawmakers also will address legislation that would allow
creation of the first legal multiracial neighborhoods. Botha would
have veto power over any plans to create such ``open area.''
   Other housing-related bills on the agenda seek to toughen
existing laws against black slum areas and squatter settlements.
   South Africa has as many as 7 million squatters among its 35
million population, according to some estimates.
   ``South Africa is confronted by ... bills straight out of the
darkest ages of apartheid,'' said the independent Sunday Times, the
country's largest Sunday newspaper.
   ``Authorities will be armed with powers to summarily evict
thousands, perhaps millions of people,'' the Sunday Times said in a
front-page editorial. ``Why must the legal process be distorted,
property seized, witch hunters licensed and countless people be
rendered homeless?''
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Judges in New York's traffic court system are
pressured to maintain high conviction rates and to give police
officers special guidance to make successful cases, a newspaper
reported Sunday.
   The system, run by the state Department of Motor Vehicles,
operates ``in a fashion that is unfair, both in face and
appearance, to the average motorist,'' according to an 11-month
investigation conducted by the state Bar Association and obtained
by the Daily News.
   ``Cases are not necessarily decided on the facts, but rather on
a preconceived idea of how many should be guilty,'' said Matthew
Jason, the former state Court of Appeals judge who led the inquiry.
   Among the findings of the study were that administrative law
judges are pressed to be tough on motorists and to give police
officers preferential treatment.
   The deputy commissioner of the motor vehicles department, Edward
Sheridan, told the newspaper that the bar association report
``completely distorted the record.''
   ``Bits and pieces of information were put together and they
leaped to conclusions not supported by the record and not supported
by a fair and competent review of the system,'' he said.
   The bar association report said supervisors pressure judges to
set higher fines and increase convictions. In addition, DMV
officials track the percentage of guilty and innocent verdicts and
average fines, and judges are required to review their monthly
records with their bosses.
   The report also says judges are ``virtual advocates for the
police'' who routinely ask the officers leading questions to help
them make their cases.

<HEAD>Doctors Will Have Smoking Check-off On Death Certificates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALEM, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oregon will add a section to state death
certificates next year asking doctors to comment on the role
tobacco played in the deaths of their patients.
   Joyce Grant-Worley, the state Health Division's chief research
analyst, said last week that the 1989 death certificates will ask,
``Did tobacco use contribute to the death?''
   Doctors will be able to check boxes marked ``yes,'' ``no,''
``probably'' or ``unknown.''
   Oregon is the first state in the nation to add such a section to
its death certificates, Grant-Worley said. The information will be
used in ongoing studies of the link between smoking and death
rates, she said.
   Oregon's research began in 1987, and while doctors were
encouraged to report smoking-related deaths, the state provided no
reminder on the forms.
   In the past, the state sent letters to doctors asking about
tobacco use if lung cancer, emphysema, bronchitis or heart disease
were reported on the death certificate without mention of smoking.
   ``We know that cigarette smoking kills,'' said Bonny Groshong, a
spokeswoman for the American Cancer Society. ``Maybe this will give
us stronger ammunition to take to the public to convince them.''
   Health Division statistics gathered since 1987 from the
voluntary participation of doctors indicate that tobacco use
contributed to 70 percent to 82 percent of respiratory disease
deaths in Oregon.
   Before 1987, smoking was listed on fewer than 5 percent of the
death certificates that listed the respiratory diseases as the
cause of death.
   Researchers say the deaths of about one in seven men and one in
10 women in Oregon were caused by lung cancer or other respiratory
diseases in 1987.
   State health officials hope the statistics eventually will help
lawmakers and health groups to plan programs to cut the smoking
rate and identify those at risk for respiratory diseases.
   ``They'll probably find that cigarettes are responsible for a
tremendous number of deaths in Oregon,'' said Dr. James Parosa, a
Salem lung specialist.
   Oregon has one of the highest rates of respiratory disease in
the nation. The state's 1987 lung cancer death rate was 59.7 per
100,000 population _ 9.1 percent higher than the estimated national
rate.

<HEAD>Iran Claims Iraqis Violated Cease-Fire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALAH NASRAWI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran charged Sunday that Iraqi troops
violated a cease-fire hours after it started by firing shots near a
U.N. observer team in the central sector of the front.
   Shipping sources in the Persian Gulf said two U.N. patrol craft,
one described as a speedboat, were patrolling the strategic Strait
of Hormuz, the gateway to the gulf, and the Shatt Al-Arab waterway,
which marks the southern boundary between Iran and Iraq.
   It was the first report of U.N. craft on patrol since the
cease-fire took effect early Saturday morning after eight years of
hostilities that claimed an estimated 1 million lives.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Cyprus, said 10 ``small-caliber bullets'' were fired by the Iraqis
in the Naftshahr sector 3{ hours after the cease-fire began.
   The agency did not mention any casualties, but it said the
gunfire occurred in the presence of U.N. observers.
   There was no immediate comment from Baghdad or the U.N.
Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group, which is monitoring the truce.
   On Saturday, the official Iraqi News Agency said an Iranian
sniper infiltrated an Iraqi ground position and killed a private.
It did not say whether the soldier was captured.
   It said Iraq did not retaliate for the incident, which allegedly
took place in the Saif Saad sector of the front line, a disputed
border area 75 miles east of Baghdad.
   IRNA on Sunday quoted an unidentified official in Tehran as
denying the Iraqi claims. ``Not a single bullet has been fired at
Iraqi positions'' since the cease-fire took effect, the official
was quoted as saying.
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz sent a message to U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar asking the world body to
try to ensure that Iran stopped intercepting Iraqi merchant ships,
the Iraqi agency said.
   Aziz was referring to the interception Saturday of an Iranian
merchant ship, the Khawla, in the Strait of Hormuz. Iraq said an
Iranian helicopter gunship and a warship shadowed the vessel.
   Iran declared Sunday it would intercept ships suspected of
carrying war material to Iraq until a comprehensive peace treaty
had been signed.
   IRNA quoted Hussein Abdi Abdi Abiyaneh, a Foreign Ministry
official, as saying Iran had the right under international law to
intercept and search ships suspected of carrying war-related
materials until a peace treaty has been signed with Baghdad.
   Although both sides have accepted the cease-fire, they are still
technically in a state of war.
   Tehran radio, meanwhile, said Sunday Iran would unilaterally
release 70 handicapped prisoners of war as soon as the Red Cross
was ready to take them.
   Iraqi and Iranian negotiators meet face-to-face in Geneva
Thursday to work on a comprehensive peace settlement.
   The Iraqi News Agency reported that Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein ``cut his way through rejoicing crowds in Baghdad'' during
mass celebrations by flag-waving countrymen Saturday to mark the
halt in hostilities.
   The Iraqi government declared Sunday, normally a working day in
the Moslem world, a national holiday to celebrate Iraq's ``decisive
victory ... and the first step toward a comprehensive peace.''
   In another development, IRNA quoted Iranian Oil Minister
Golamreza Aqazadeh as saying Iran would repair vital oil facilities
battered in the war at ``maximum speed'' as soon as the cease-fire
``proves durable,'' says.
   Aqazadeh said Saturday Iran would go ahead with major oil
industry projects to boost exports, refining capacity and
exploration and to expand its energy industry.

   A helicopter selling rides at a Mississippi
River festival crashed in a grassy field, killing the pilot and two
passengers, police said Sunday.
   ``According to witnesses, the engine failed, quit running, and
it dropped 200 feet to the ground and was completely destroyed on
impact,'' Hampton Police Chief Stephen Danay said.
   The three-seat helicopter, owned by Midwest Aviation of
Davenport, Iowa, had offered rides throughout the day to people at
the second annual Hampton Beach Party before it crashed about 7:30
p.m. Saturday, Danay said.
   The helicopter had taken off from the festival, which drew about
5,000 people, and had flown two miles north when it slammed into
the field in Illiniwek Park, Danay said.
   ``It appeared the pilot realized he had problems and tried to
put it down in a grassy field when this happeed,'' he said.
   Danay said the crash killed pilot Gary Wesolowski, 27, of nearby
Silvis; and passengers John Cross, 41, of Davenport, Iowa; and
Marjorie Schroeder, 28, of Moline.

<HEAD>In-House Training Programs Said Biggest Source of Skilled Workers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Employers of technical and other skilled
workers look to in-house training programs more than any other
source for filling their manpower needs, according to a survey by
private trade schools released Sunday.
   More than 70 percent of the 400 businesses questioned rated
in-house training programs as an important source of skilled
employees, according to the survey commissioned by the National
Associations of Trade & Technical Schools.
   Sixty percent of the employers listed four-year colleges and
universities as important sources of skilled labor, followed by 50
percent who listed private trade schools and 45 percent who cited
vocational high schools.
   Two-year public vocational schools such as community colleges
were listed by 44 percent of the businesses as an important source
of skilled labor while union apprenticeship programs were listed by
only 26 percent of the employers.
   The telephone survey was limited to computer programming and
service companies, auto repair shops, radio, television and
appliance repair firms, and physicians' and dentists' offices. All
are most likely to hire skilled and technical workers, the
association said.
   While 62 percent of the surveyed companies said they have
graduates of private trade and technical schools on their payrolls,
only 50 percent said they actively recruit them. Only 14 percent
said they actually contract with such schools to train workers for
them.
   Medical and dental offices said they were most satisfied by the
performance of trade school graduates, followed by radio, TV and
appliance repair shops and computer-related businesses.
   Auto repair shops were the least satisfied, with only 16 percent
listing trade school graduates on their payrolls as excellent
performers. Auto repair shops tended more than the other employer
groups to rely most on in-house training programs.
   Only 46 percent of the surveyed companies said students
graduating from private trade schools had a better chance of
getting a high-paying job than graduates of public vocational
schools.
   ``In general, employers are satisfied with the job we do,''said
association chairman William Carson.
   Carson said he was concerned that one-third of the respondents
agreed with a statement that private schools appear more interested
in making a profit than training students, and that many exist only
to take advantage of federal grants and loans.
   ``Obviously some bad publicity from a small percentage of
schools has hurt our image,'' he said. ``Schools are profitable
because they train well and their graduates get jobs. Our incentive
is to make more students succeed because then we succeed. The two
go hand-in-hand.''

   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who ran for this year's Democratic
presidential nomination, said he would fast for three days as soon
as Chavez ended his fast. At a rally a week ago, Jackson also urged
others to fast for two or three days.
   Jackson attended Sunday's Mass along with Ethel Kennedy, Sen.
Kennedy's widow, and three of their children, Kerry, Rory and
Christopher.
   Jackson and Mrs. Kennedy stood in apparent shock at Chavez's
weakened condition as he was assisted to the Mass with his arms
draped around the necks of two sons, Anthony and Paul Chavez.
   Another son, Fernando Chavez, read a prepared statement in which
the UFW president said: ``Today, I pass on the Fast for Life to
hundreds of concerned men and women throughout North America and
the world who have offered to share the suffering.''

<HEAD>Israel Shortens Work Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Cabinet on Sunday shortened Israel's work
week from six days to five, granting public workers a two-day
weekend for the first time, a government spokesman said.
   The plan, part of a long-term wage agreement, will affect about
400,000 public sector employees, including teachers, government and
health workers, a Finance Ministry spokesman said. Public workers
constitute approximately one-third of Israel's labor force.
   ``We do not expect financial gain from this, but if the whole
world has discovered the secret of a five-day week, there must be a
good reason,'' said spokesman Yitzhak Feinberg.
   Israeli workers currently work a 45-hour week, with full days
Sunday through Thursday and a half-day on Friday. Saturday is the
Jewish Sabbath.
   The week will gradually be reduced to 42{ hours, spread over
five days, and then to 40 hours, Feinberg said. The plan will be
implemented in stages and is expected to be fully in effect by the
end of 1989, he said.
   Feinberg did not say when the first phase would begin.
   Public transportation, businesses and restaurants are closed in
most Israeli cities on the Sabbath. The two-day weekend will give
people a chance to shop, eat out, go to movies and travel on
Fridays.
   Many private businesses have already instituted a five-day work
week, and others are expected to follow suit.

<TEXT>
   Pulitzer Prize-winning author William
Styron was awarded the prestigious Edward MacDowell Medal for his
lifetime achievements Sunday, but told the audience he wasn't sure
such honors should be necessary.
   ``Are prizes necessary or even desirable?'' the author of
``Sophie's Choice'' asked the crowd of 800 at the 450-acre
MacDowell artists' colony. ``Shouldn't the satisfaction of one's
work be sufficient reward?''
   Styron, who joins 28 previous medalists including Leonard
Bernstein, Georgia O'Keeffe, Alexander Calder and John Updike,
noted that his American literary ancestors never had to deal with
the egos and competition involved in prize winning.
   ``No medals for Edgar Allan Poe, no medals for (Nathaniel)
Hawthorne, no medals for (Walt) Whitman. No medals, no prizes, no
annual publisher's award, no seal of approval, no fellowships or
grants,'' Styron said.
   Yet Styron, who won the Pulitzer Prize in 1967 for ``The
Confessions of Nat Turner'' and the American Book Award for
``Sophie's Choice,'' said he found the medal ``one of the purest
awards for artistic achievement in the United States'' because it
was judged by Updike, Norman Mailer and other prominent authors.
   Previous award winners ``represent the brightest constellation
of talent that could be assembled in the late half of this
century,'' Styron said.
   Styron said he is continuing work on a novel about the Marine
Corps and on a non-fiction work based on his recent visit to
Nicaragua.
   Styron's previous works have taken on larger issues such as
racism and the Holocaust, but he called the war in Nicaragua a
shameful conflict, and said he was shocked there was ``almost no
passion or feeling on the part of American writers to try to find a
solution to it.''
   The MacDowell Colony provides private studios to painters,
sculptors, musicians and other artists. It was founded by the widow
of Edward MacDowell, a composer who died in 1908.

   A Soviet rocket crashed in northeastern Canada
Sunday morning after lighting up the sky from New Mexico to
Michigan as it fell out of orbit, a Defense Department spokesman
said. No injuries or damage were reported.
   The craft, which plummeted to Earth at about 1 a.m. EDT, was
launched by the Soviets on Aug. 18 to carry a Gorizont
communications satellite into orbit, said Maj. Alex Mondragon,
spokesman for the North American Aerospace Defense Command and the
U.S. Space Command, speaking from Peterson Air Force Base near
Colorado Springs.
   He said the rocket was probably an SL12, one of the Soviets'
workhorse models.
   ``It's not unusual for a rocket body not to stay in orbit,'' he
said. ``There's nothing to keep it there.''
   The craft was tracked by officials at the U.S. Space
Surveillance Center at Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado, where about
7,200 space vehicles are constantly being surveilled. An average of
one space vehicle reenters the Earth's atmosphere each day, he said.
   Mondragon said the rocket had ``no connection whatsoever'' to
the Cosmos 1900, an out-of-control, nuclear-powered Soviet spy
satellite that has been falling out of orbit for several months.
   Cosmos 1900, launched last Dec. 12, is now expected to reenter
the Earth's atmosphere in late September or early October,
Mondragon said.
   Mondragon and Pentagon spokesman Maj. Mike Stepp provided no
further details about the craft's condition when it reached the
Earth or the precise location where it came down.
   Mondragon said it usually takes about 24 hours to pinpoint where
downed satellites plummet to Earth.
   The spokesmen said the descending rocket was visible to
residents of New Mexico, Colorado, Nebraska and Michigan.
   ``I do understand it was pretty spectacular,'' Stepp said.
   He said the downing of the craft, which he referred to as a
``non-nuclear Soviet rocket body,'' was expected by U.S. officials.
   ``It was predicted it would come down, it came down as predicted
and it came down where it was predicted,'' he said.
   Mondragon said officials do not try to recover parts of such
rocket bodies because 95 percent of them usually burn up upon
reentry.
   ``That spectacular light show that they provide folks with is
the rocket body burning up,'' he said.
   Two other federal agencies, questioned earlier Sunday about
reports that a Soviet satellite had crashed in the Great Lakes
area, said they had no direct evidence of such an event.
   Lt. Jay Butler, a Coast Guard spokesman, said his agency had
heard that members of the public had reported seeing something
crash in the area of the Great Lakes. But he said the Coast Guard
had not recovered debris or even searched for any.
   Susan Hawes, a duty officer with the Federal Aviation
Administration, said the FAA had not tracked a falling object.

<HEAD>British Diplomat Sees Imprisoned Briton in Iran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran permitted a British diplomat on Sunday to
visit a Briton imprisoned in Tehran for nearly two years without
trial, the Foreign Office said.
   Diplomat David Reddaway, who went to Iran Aug. 12 following a
thaw in relations between the two countries, found Nicholas Nicola
``in good health and reasonably cheerful,'' a Foreign Office
spokesman said.
   They met for 30 minutes, and the diplomat gave the prisoner some
``creature comforts,'' including cheese and pickles from London,
the spokesman said.
   Nicola, who Britain says was a tourist, was detained by the
Iranians in September 1986 for allegedly firing a gun near the
Pakistan border. Iranian authorities said he had infiltrated into
their country from Pakistan.
   He has not been charged, and the Iranians barred consular access
to him until Sunday.
   The Foreign Office spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Reddaway had also been given an indication that he
will be able to see Roger Cooper, a second Briton held without
trial by the Iranians.
   Cooper, a businessman who lived in Iran for more than 20 years,
was accused of spying in November 1985. Britain has complained that
Cooper was initially charged with overstaying his visa and that the
spying charge came later.
   He and Nicola are held at Tehran's maximum-security Evin Prison.
   Permission to see Nicola was given at a meeting with Iranian
Foreign Ministry representatives earlier Sunday.
   Reddaway was sent to Iran to examine the possibility of Britain
resuming a full-time diplomatic presence there.
   A recent, gradual easing of strain between the two countries has
also raised hopes for release of three Britons, including Anglican
Church envoy Terry Waite, who are believed held in Lebanon by
pro-Iranian extremists.
   Eighteen foreigners are believed held in Lebanon, including nine
Americans. The longest-held is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

   Three men and a women fled East Germany Sunday by
swimming across a river to West Berlin, narrowly avoiding a patrol
boat and clambering up a river bank to safety, news reports and
West Berlin officials said.
   West Berlin police said the woman in the group injured a foot in
the early evening swim of about 260 feet across Berlin's Spree
River. The others were uninjured.
   West Germany's ARD television showed video footage of the
escapees swimming the last 10 feet to the West Berlin bank just as
the East German patrol boat approached a few yards away.
   ARD said the film was taken by a Briton who happened to be on
the western bank at the time. The report did not provide the names
of the escapees or of the person taping the scene.
   The Wall separating communist East Berlin from West Berlin is
located on the eastern side of the river at the spot where the
escape took place.
   However, the western bank of the river is the actual border,
with the water in East Berlin territory.
   A West Berlin police official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said East German border guards did not shoot or
otherwise attempt to stop the escapees. No shots were fired from
the patrol boat.
   Police said they did not know how the four got past the Wall,
which is 10 feet high in most sections.
   The three western sectors of Berlin are controlled by the United
States, Britain and France. East Berlin is the Soviet sector of the
city, which is located 110 miles east of the West German border.

   Troops charged hundreds of demonstrators and
pushed them out of a central park Sunday when the protesters began
chanting ``Prague, Prague, Prague'' in memory of the Soviet-led
invasion of Czechoslovakia 20 years ago.
   Several dozen people, some shouting ``Fascists!'' at police,
were taken away, but the exact number was not known. No injuries
were reported among the 500 demonstrators and onlookers or the 500
national guard soldiers and police.
   The protest was called by the Democratic Union, an unsanctioned
political party that Soviet officials have denounced as illegal.
   About 100 demonstrators staged a second rally later Sunday along
the Arbat shopping mall, said Democratic Union member Alexander
Chuyev. He said police chased them and arrested an unspecified
number who resisted.
   Soviet television carried a report on the nightly news program
``Vremya'' showing a relatively quiet scene in Prague. The
announcer said few residents of the Czechoslovak capital heeded
calls to demonstrate on the anniversary. There was no mention of
the Moscow demonstrations.
   But reporters in Prague said an estimated 10,000 people marched
through the city shouting ``Freedom!'' and ``Russians go home!''
They said the march began after a rally in Wenceslas Square.
   Police did not interfere for about 30 minutes but then blocked
the marchers. At least five people were reported detained.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, termed the first
demonstration in Moscow a ``planned provocative gathering'' and
denounced the Democratic Union as a group of anti-socialist
agitators. It said the activists were given a written warning from
Moscow authorities that they were banned from holding a public
rally.
   The crackdown was in keeping with the Kremlin's steadfast
defense of the Warsaw Pact invasion of Aug. 20-21, 1968, although
some Soviets have suggested the ``Prague Spring'' reforms crushed
in Czechoslovakia resemble those now being tried in the Soviet
Union.
   In the first protest, busloads of uniformed police and troops
surrounded the park across from Pushkin Square and shouted over
loudspeakers: ``Leave the designated area or you will be
detained.'' The crowd responded by chanting the name of the
Czechoslovak capital.
   The well-organized police action prevented display of any
banners or placards. People who tried to unfurl slogans were seized
by the troops, who grew in force during the late-afternoon action
to eventually number 500.
   Those speaking out were grabbed by groups of police, soldiers,
plainclothes agents and volunteers and carried roughly to buses
that were parked around the park's perimeter.
   What began at 4 p.m. as an orderly gathering turned into a melee
as the soldiers in gray uniforms and berets linked arms and charged
the crowd to force it out of the park.
   The human cordons swept protesters, journalists and bystanders
alike into surrounding streets and bushes. Several pairs of smashed
eyeglasses lay on steps and walkways after the demonstrators were
forced out.
   ``Fascists! Fascists! Shame on you!'' activists shouted as
police grabbed those who tried to address the crowd and carried
them onto waiting buses.
   ``Is this what you call `glasnost?''' one woman shouted out in
English, referring to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's campaign
for more openness and democracy. The woman identified herself only
as an American tourist.
   Most of the demonstrators returned within a few minutes and
began chanting ``Prague, Prague, Prague,'' and ``Shame on the
occupiers.''
   When they refused to disperse, more soldiers were summoned and
the mass of demonstrators was forced onto busy Gorky Street, which
separates the park area from Pushkin Square.
   ``This is a nightmare. They grabbed me by the hair and threw me
in the bus,'' Olga Kazaryan of Moscow told reporters after
convincing the soldiers she had only been a bystander. ``They're
fascists.''
   When a plainclothesman shouted at her and a companion that the
Democratic Union was an illegal organization, Natalya Babasyan
shouted back: ``I'm not a member of any union, but we have a right
to walk around.''
   The official Tass news agency on Friday denounced the ``Prague
Spring'' reforms as anti-socialist activity that attempted to
``tear Czechoslovakia away from the socialist community.''
   Tass dismissed comparisons between the liberalization
orchestrated by then-Czechoslovak Communist Party leader Alexander
Dubcek and those now championed by Gorbachev. The news agency
called such comparisons the result of Western propaganda and
defended the Warsaw Pact invasion ago as the correct action of
concerned friends and neighbors.
   But a Soviet historian writing for the journal Arguments and
Facts noted this month that the reform program crushed by Soviet
tanks 20 years ago had the same aims as Gorbachev's effort for
perestroika, or rebuilding.
   The Foreign Ministry spokesman, Gennady I. Gerasimov, said at a
news conference last week that the main difference between the two
reform movements was ``20 years.'' But he held to the standard
Kremlin defense of its action as a necessary move to protect the
gains of socialist revolution.

   Heavy rainfall caused flooding Sunday in Phoenix, Ariz., and
across portions of the Florida Panhandle, while hail pelted
west-central Minnesota.
   A flash flood watch was posted over parts of western Arizona and
Southern California, where a flood Saturday roared through a canyon
in historic, gold-rush Calico Ghost Town and swamped about five
dozen cars.
   Rain showers and thunderstorms spread across South Dakota and
northern Nebraska, from the southern half of the Atlantic Coast
across the lower Mississippi Valley, from central New Mexico into
Southern California and in the San Francisco area.
   Rainfall during a six-hour period ended at 2 p.m. EDT included
almost 3 inches at Pensacola, Fla., more than 1} inches at Cape
Hatteras, N.C., more than 1{ inches at Biloxi, Miss., more than 1
inch at Jackson, Miss., and almost an inch at Vichy, Mo., and
Orlando and Jacksonville, Fla.
   In Minnesota, heavy rain and small hail fell at Fergus Falls and
near Battle Lake; 1-inch diameter hail fell at nearby Detroit Lakes.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 56
degrees at Arcata and Crescent City, Calif., to 100 degrees at
Altus, Okla. The low temperature for the nation Sunday morning was
34 degrees at Butte, Mont.
   The national weather forecast for Monday called for showers and
thunderstorms from Florida and southern Georgia across southern
Mississippi and eastern Louisiana, from the upper and middle
Mississippi Valley across eastern portions of Kansas and Nebraska,
and from central Colorado to central Arizona.
   High temperatures were expected to reach the 60s in eastern New
England, 70s from the rest of New England across Virginia and the
Great Lakes, and over the central and southern coast of California
and central Colorado and central Arizona. Temperatures were
forecast to reach 100 degrees or near 100 in southwest Oregon,
north-central Texas and Oklahoma, with nearly 105 in the desert
Southwest. High temperatures in the remainder of the nation should
be in the seasonable 80s and 90s.

<HEAD>Army Troops Trained to Reinforce Yellowstone Firefighters</HEAD>

   Gusty winds spread fires to at least 350,000 acres in
Yellowstone National Park, while 1,100 soldiers were trained Sunday
to reinforce firefighters battling a 110,000-acre fire advancing
toward two Montana communities.
   The 60 mph winds that whipped the fires into 100-foot walls of
flame and 30,000-foot columns of smoke Saturday calmed down
somewhat by Sunday but were expected to reach about 25 mph, park
spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo said.
   ``We have an intense fire situation in Yellowstone,'' Anzelmo
said. About 3,000 firefighters have been fighting fires for several
weeks in Yellowstone.
   Eighteen instructors from the Boise Interagency Fire Center
trained troops at Fort Lewis, Wash., to relieve civilian
firefighters and free expert crews for more complex work, fire
officials said.
   The soldiers were to board Army transport planes Monday morning
for flights to Bozeman, Mont., where they will be assigned to the
Clover-Mist fire in Yellowstone, said Chuck Tarver, a civilian
installation operations officer at the Army base south of Tacoma.
   The winds in Yellowstone forced evacuation and closure of the
park's south entrance as well as the Grant Village area, which
contains a hotel, campground and housing for park staff. Several
stretches of road inside the park, as well as the Norris, Pebble
Creek and Madison campgrounds, also remained closed Sunday.
   On Sunday, several hundred residents of Silver Gate and Cooke
City, two communities in Montana near Yellowstone, considered
evacuating because the 100,000-acre fire was within six miles of
their homes, said Hays Kirby, owner of the Grizzly Lodge in Silver
Gate.
   ``Some residents are packing and we have alerted elderly
people,'' he said. Most of the residents, mostly summer people,
will stay and fight, Kirby added.
   In Montana, firefighters battled blazes across the state that
totalled more than 115,000 acres, the worst fires in the state
since 1984 when more than 250,000 acres were charred.
   In Southern California, firefighters brought under control a
1,237-acre brush fire on the rocky north slope of the San Jacinto
Mountains on Saturday, while a 300-acre fire in the San Bernardino
National Forest was contained, officials said.
   Hot, dry winds Sunday plagued 200 firefighters in northern
Idaho's Nez Perce National Forest, where a 320-acre fire burned in
inaccessible terrain 11 miles north of the Salmon River.
   In Montana, about 1,900 firefighters encircled about 80 percent
of the pesky 35,200-acre Warm Springs fire in the Elkhorn Mountains
about 10 miles southeast of Helena, said Bob Krepps of the
Department of State Lands.
   The fire, which has burned 10 homes and cabins since it started
Aug. 9, did not threaten any structures, Knepps said. National
Guard transport planes from California and Wyoming will continue to
drop retardant on the fire, he said, while crews try to finish
encircling fire lines.
   But the Hellroaring Creek fire, in the inaccessible
Absarokee-Beartooth Wilderness Area 170 miles southeast of Helena,
tripled to about 33,000 acres, said Gallatin National Forest
spokeswoman Maggie Pittman.
   A fire on the northeast side of the Absarokee-Beartooth, in the
Custer National Forest, flared in up to 70 mph winds Saturday to
roughly 15,000 acres in the Stillwater River drainage, said
spokesman Phil Jacquet. The Stillwater fire is to the north of
Silver Gate and Cooke City, adding to residents' fears.
   Trails into the area were closed and recreationists were warned
by rangers to leave, Jacquet said.
   However, officials in Montana said they were optimistic because
of cooler temperatures and dying winds. Hundreds of other
firefighters fought a dozen smaller blazes.
   Two new fires in the Bridger-Teton National Forest and Grand
Teton National Park in Wyoming spread to more than 7,500 acres,
forcing the evacuation of about 40 students from the summer Teton
Science School and guests from several ranches. Officials also
closed the Rockefeller Junior Memorial Parkway linking Yellowstone
and Grand Teton, said fire information officer Nick Zufelt.

   Farm labor leader Cesar Chavez ended his
36-day fast at a Mass Sunday by breaking bread with the children of
Robert Kennedy as thousands showed their support for his boycott of
California table grapes.
   ``Today I pass on the Fast for Life to hundreds of concerned men
and women throughout North America and the world who have offered
to share the suffering,'' Chavez said in a statement read by his
son Fernando Chavez.
   An emaciated Chavez, who according to his doctor lost 33{ pounds
or 19 percent of his body weight, was assisted to the Mass with his
arms draped around the necks of two other sons, Anthony and Paul
Chavez.
   Jesse Jackson attended with Kennedy's widow, Ethel, and both
appeared shocked at Chavez's condition. Also attending were three
of Mrs. Kennedy's children, Kerry, Rory and Christopher.
   The senator dramatically shared a Roman Catholic Communion that
ended Chavez's first major fast 20 years ago.
   Jackson began a three-day fast of his own to support the boycott
called to protest use of certain pesticides on table grapes.
   Thousands of union supporters, including movie stars and
politicians, attended the Mass held outdoors under a giant white
tent in near 100-degree heat.
   After he sat in a wooden rocker, Chavez leaned over to his
96-year-old mother, who was crying, and dabbed her eyes with a
handkerchief.
   Chavez, 61, kept up the water-only fast, his longest, despite
doctors' advice that he was endangering his health. He conducted a
25-day fast in 1968 and a 24-day fast in 1972.
   Since he began the fast July 17, the United Farm Workers union
president suffered from escalating bouts of nausea, vomiting,
dizziness and cramps.
   Doctors caring for Chavez were concerned last week that he
wouldn't have the strength to sustain the fast until Sunday. His
doctors worried about his early dehydration and elevated levels of
uric acid, which can lead to kidney failure.
   Doctors reported on Aug. 13 that Chavez had consumed all of his
body fat and that he was beginning to burn muscle tissue.
   After the Mass, Chavez was taken from the union compound in this
community 150 miles north of Los Angeles to an undisclosed location
where he will have a liquid diet, including light broth and
non-citrus juices for a week to 10 days, said one of his
physicians, Dr. Marion Moses.
   ``Recovery will be long and slow,'' she said, adding that
Chavez, a vegetarian, began the fast in good health and remained
mentally sharp throughout.
   The mass was Chavez's first public appearance since Aug. 11,
when he ceased attending nightly community meetings.
   Chavez began this fast to emphasize his demand for a ban on five
pesticides used on table grapes. The union claims the materials
cause cancer in field workers and pose other serious health risks.
   Grape growers and grocers blasted Chavez and the union for
unduly frightening consumers about the safety of table grapes in an
effort to fight a political battle.
   Chavez raised the pesticide issue in 1986, and called for
Captan, Dinoseb, Phosdrin, methyl bromide and Parathion to be taken
off the market.
   In the early days of this fast, Chavez held union meetings,
visited with union delegations, meditated, prayed and went on a
daily walk.
   As his strength waned, Chavez steadily scaled back his
activities. He spent increasing amounts of time bedridden in a
small bare room in the union's retirement village, and his staff
entered the room only at his request.

   Israeli soldiers fatally shot two Palestinian
teen-agers Sunday and 12 other Arabs were wounded during bloody
clashes in the occupied lands, hospital officials said.
   Meanwhile, Israeli police announced the arrest of four men in
connection with a bomb attack that wounded 25 Israelis near a
crowded sidewalk cafe in Haifa.
   Palestinians observed a general strike Sunday to mark the 19th
anniversary of an arson fire that ravaged a mosque in Jerusalem.
   In the village of Tubas in the occupied West Bank, soldiers shot
and killed 17-year-old Rajah Hamad Hamdan during a clash, according
to officials at Al Ittihad Hospital in Nablus.
   In Gaza City, in the occupied Gaza Strip, a military spokesman
said the army put a curfew on the Bureij refugee camp after
18-year-old Nael Hamad was shot to death during a clash with
soldiers.
   The deaths brought to 251 the number of Palestinians killed
since the Palestinian uprising in the occupied lands began Dec. 8.
Four Israelis also have died.
   Haifa Police Chief Yaacov Haviv said he is certain terrorists
staged a Saturday night hand grenade attack in Haifa.
   He announced the arrest of four men from the occupied West Bank
suspected in the attack, which wounded 25 Israelis in a crowded
shopping mall in the northeastern port city.
   Haviv said eight others were being detained for questioning.
Fifteen more Arabs were questioned and freed overnight, he said.
   Among the casualties of the attack were two children. Dan Meir,
8, lost both feet, and his brother, Yonathan, 2, was wounded in the
abdomen, said officials at Rambam Hospital in Haifa. Five other
family members, including a 5-year-old sister, were slightly
injured.
   The boys' father, Maryan, told army radio:
   ``I don't know who threw (the bomb), Jews or Arabs, but whoever
threw it is below any level of humanity because whether there's a
political problem or not, he directed the grenade, and I saw this,
toward my children.''
   Haifa Mayor Aryeh Gurel said the attack appeared aimed at
harming Jewish-Arab ties in a city that has become a symbol of
coexistence.
   ``They will not succeed in their goal of upsetting Jewish-Arab
relations,'' Gurel said in a statement.
   Haifa's population of 243,000 includes 20,000 Arabs who hold
Israeli citizenship and many of whom live in mixed neighborhoods
with Jews.
   In the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Palestinians shuttered stores
and stayed home from work in a dozen major cities in a strike
called by Moslem fundamentalists.
   The strike marks the 19th anniversary of the arson fire that
ravaged the Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, one of Islam's holiest
sites. The fire was started by an Australian sheepshearer who was
later deported.
   Hospital officials said 12 Palestinians were admitted Sunday to
a hospital in Nablus, the largest West Bank city with a population
of 120,000.
   At least nine were shot during clashes with troops, but three
from the Askar refugee camp on the city's outskirts were shot by
unidentified men in civilian clothes, an Arab reporter said.
   The army said it knew of only three men being wounded.
   Troops maintained curfews on three refugee camps in the West
Bank and three in the Gaza Strip, Israeli news reports said.
   Meanwhile, the Jerusalem Post and Haaretz newspapers reported
that an Israeli officer deliberately shot and killed a Palestinian
inmate during a riot at the Ketziot prison on Aug. 16. The army
denied the report.
   The prison in the Negev Desert houses about 2,500 inmates, most
of whom have been sentenced to six months in prison without trial.
The army said two prisoners were fatally shot when troops opened
fire to stop stone-throwers.
   The newspaper quoted witnesses as saying a soldier shot Assad Al
Shawwa of Gaza City in the chest at point-blank range when the
prisoner refused an order and then defiantly told the soldier, ``Go
ahead, shoot me.''

   Someone broke into and ransacked an
optometrist's office, then left a note chiding the eye doctor for
being short-sighted and leaving the door unlocked, police said
Sunday.
   ``You're pretty dumb to leave your back door open. Please in the
future, don't leave it open,'' the handwritten note said. ``In a
world like today's, you can't trust anyone. So don't be dumb.''
   The Panorama City office was ransacked between 5 p.m. Saturday
and 7 a.m. Sunday, when a janitor discovered the break-in, Sgt.
Jeff Sheldon said.
   Some pairs of glasses were thrown around the office, and someone
had drawn on posters with felt-tip markers, he said.
   Police didn't yet know if anything had been stolen.
   The address of the office was not released because the
proprietor had not been notified.

<TEXT>
   Israel is preparing to launch a surveillance
satellite into low Earth orbit, giving it a potential advantage in
any military confrontation with its neighbors in the Middle East,
Time magazine reported Sunday.
   Citing unidentified intelligence sources, the magazine said the
Israelis plan first to launch an experimental satellite designed to
last less than a month. If successful, Israel then would put up a
satellite with a life-span of about two years.
   The magazine said Israeli defense officials are divided over
whether to launch the satellite as soon as possible, or to wait and
avoid adding fuel to the region's arms race. The Israeli inner
cabinet is expected to make a decision within the next few weeks,
Time said.
   Last summer, the Geneva-based International Defense Review
magazine reported that Israel had test-fired a medium-range missile
capable of carrying a nuclear warhead. The Time report said a
second purpose of the launch was to test Israel's ability to launch
a surveillance satellite.

   CHICAG0 (AP) _ Republican presidential nominee George Bush said
Sunday he has ``no hesitancy'' about keeping Dan Quayle as his
running mate and declared he's ready to ``take the heat'' on the
controversy over Quayle's military service.
   ``I've remained cool in this crisis because I've been there
before,'' Bush told a pool of reporters accompanying him on Air
Force Two to Chicago. Bush talked to reporters soon after Quayle
returned to Washington for meetings with high-level Bush aides on
his campaign plans.
   Quayle has come under harsh criticism for using his wealthy
family's influence to join the National Guard rather than be
drafted at the height of the Vietnam War.
   ``I want him out campaigning,'' Bush said of Quayle, saying the
Indiana senator appeals to young people and to women voters.
   Flying here from a visit to the Illinois State Fair in
Springfield, Ill., Bush emphatically denied there had been any
consideration given in his campaign organization to asking Quayle
to step aside _ and said Quayle had offered no such withdrawal.
   Bush said Quayle would return to the campaign trail in his own
right ``as soon as he can get squared away ... he hadn't even had a
chance to get his staff together'' when the military controversy
developed.
   ``He's been thrown into a hornet's nest, but, you know, I've
been there,'' the vice president said. ``I've got to take the heat.
I made the decision. The buck stops right here.
   ``I have no hesitancy about it.''
   Earlier in the day, Bush had donned an Air National Guard cap
and greeted citizen soldiers while saying Quayle had served Guard
with ``pride and honor.''
   Bush said he could not understand why news organizations are
raising so many questions about Quayle, adding, ``I don't see that
there's an enormous demand from the public to know his high school
grades.''
   As for reports that Quayle had assistance in joining the guard
from an employee of his grandfather's newspaper, Bush said ``I had
help from my dad, and I expect Lloyd Bentsen did and Michael
Dukakis did. Is it that unusual that a parent would help his son?''
   ``Some people burned their draft cards. Some went to Canada.
Some in the Senate turned in their medals. We could damage an
entire generation here,'' Bush commented.
   After Bush and Quayle parted on the campaign trail at Cleveland,
the vice president told a crowd at the Illinois State Fair that
Quayle ``will be a good advocate of the things we believe.''
   For the first time since the pair started joint appearances in
Indiana on Friday, Quayle did not comment publicly to the large
throng of reporters that has been covering the campaign outings in
Indiana and Ohio.
   On his arrival at an Air National Guard wing of the Springfield
airport, Bush jumped out of his limousine and made a point of
greeting men and women members of a Guard unit.
   He said the National Guard was ``a very honorable service'' and
said that others ``ought not try to be making something wrong out
of serving in that way.''
   Bush jumped off a tractor-drawn tram on the grounds on the
fairgrounds and went over to an Air National Guard exhibit, and
climbed up on a platform. He peered into the barrel of an unarmed
TOW antitank missile launcher.
   Encouraged by people in the crowd, Bush playfully aimed the
weapon towards the platform holding the reporters and photographers.
   The Bush campaign has criticized the aggressive attempt by
traveling reporters to ferret out Quayle's motives in joining the
Guard.
   ``In him, we have a man, 41 years old, who did serve in the
National Guard with pride and honor,'' Bush said.
   ``He'll do well,'' Bush said, when asked how the senator would
fare on the campaign trail. ``I don't know that he has to learn
anything (about campaigning). He's got to get his act together, get
the schedules going. This (the controversy) hit him out of a clear
blue sky.''
   Bush said campaign manager Jim Baker had returned to Washington
along with ``a lot of our people'' to help Quayle prepare for his
solo campaign outings.
   ``It's a question of where he's going to go, how he's going to
campaign and he'll do very, very well,'' said Bush.
   Campaign officials said Quayle likely would hit the trail
beginning Wednesday, although they did not say where he would go.
They did say it was possible Quayle would be reunited with Bush in
Texas later in the week.
   Meanwhile, press secretary Sheila Tate sought to minimize
increasing press scrutiny of the circumstances surrounding Quayle's
admission to the University of Indiana Law School, in view of
Quayle's mediocre undergraduate grades.
   ``The senator has widely conceded that he did not cut a wide
academic swath, but he did want to go to law school,'' she said.
``He may have gotten in because he went down and talked ... and
convinced (school officials) ... of the seriousness of his purpose
and his motivation.''
   Sitting at a picnic table while munching on a variety of ethnic
foods, Bush laughed off questions about Quayle's academic record.
   ``Don't take a look at my lackluster performance,'' he told
reporters who hovered nearby. ``I refuse to release my high school
transcripts because I failed chemistry. I don't want anyone to know
that. ... I want to be a president that chemists can look up to.''

<TEXT>
   A plan that led to the establishment of many of
the nation's emergency shelters for homeless people was ``a major
mistake'' and helped swell the ranks of the nation's homeless in
recent years, experts said Sunday.
   The National Coalition for the Homeless estimates there are
between 2 million and 3 million homeless people in the United
States. Women and children make up about 60 percent.
   The homeless should have access to more affordable housing and
assistance to ease dependency on crowded, understaffed shelters,
according to those who participated in a seminar at the annual
meeting of the Society for the Study of Social Problems.
   ``The three-tiered plan was a major mistake,'' said Anita L.
Beaty, executive director of Atlanta's Task Force for the Homeless.
``It was much too conservative and allowed for a service
institution that blames the victim.''
   The plan was drawn up and embraced nationally by advocacy groups
for the homeless in recent years. It called for providing crisis
services in emergency shelters, helping homeless people
re-establish their lives and supplying low-income housing for those
who can live independently, said Madeline Stoner of the University
of Southern California's School of Social Work.
   But that won't work because many homeless people have turned the
temporary shelters into ``a permanent living situation,'' she said.
   ``Shelters have not only failed to stem the growth of
homelessness, their existence has served to perpetuate the homeless
condition by keeping many in a transient state,'' she said.
   Social workers should move away from shelter-oriented services
and toward serving as many people as possible at a low cost, Ms.
Stoner said. Recruiting new businesses to improve employment
chances and strengthening vagrancy and public nuisance laws would
be a good start, she added.

   This town isn't quite sure whether
it's taking a licking or getting a compliment in a restaurant
chain's television ads tweaking its famous chicken dinners.
   The ads, scheduled for broadcast in Michigan and the Cleveland
area for Elias Brothers Restaurants, feature an older, white-haired
Southern gentleman not unlike Col. Harlan Sanders of Kentucky Fried
Chicken fame. He suggests customers buy their chicken at Elias Big
Boy restaurants instead of ``Frankenmuth _ wherever that is.''
   Talk chicken in this Saginaw County town and you're talking
Zehnder's of Frankenmuth and Bavarian Inn Inc., which jointly hold
the rights to the phrase ``Frankenmuth Chicken.''
   Officials with the two restaurants said they were routinely
checking whether the Elias Brothers ads represented trademark or
copyright infringement.
   ``We're not really upset about it,'' said Donald D. Keller,
marketing director for the Bavarian Inn. ``We're not trying to take
action against Big Boy or planning any kind of negative move at
this time, but we have a reputation that has taken many years and
millions of dollars to develop.
   ``There is another side of it, though,'' he added. ``We're
terribly flattered we've got that kind of reputation, that
comparing their chicken to ours is a way to show they know we are
the mark of excellence.''
   ``Frankenmuth is a very popular stop for chicken dinners,''
agreed Tony Michaels, marketing director for Warren-based Elias
Brothers. ``Big Boy is also popular for chicken. So we're really
using it as a means of comparison.''
   Michaels also stressed that the ads carry a disclaimer below the
Colonel Sanders look-alike reading, ``Not who you think it is.''

   Sponsors of a food festival here ordered
up samplings of food from many of the city's restaurants and a
large chocolate milkshake. In fact, they claim it was the largest
shake on record.
   At 4 p.m. Saturday, a 40-foot dairy truck brought 1,500 gallons
of milkshake to the annual Taste New Haven.
   The giant shake was intended to top the 50-gallon record set in
1988 and the record of 250 gallons that will appear in 1989
editions of the Guinness Book of World Records.
   No one from the record book was present to certify the event,
but witnesses were on hand to provide sworn statements, said Patty
LaVigne, promotion director for Bridgeport radio station WEZN, a
Taste New Haven co-sponsor.
   The confection was donated by Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream to be
sold at $1 per 16-ounce serving, with the proceeds going to the
Muscular Dystrophy Association.

   ``The Last Emperor'' opened Sunday in the Chinese
capital to packed theaters but moviegoers gave a muted reaction to
the film about the end of China's pre-communist royal dynasty.
   One woman, waiting for a bus after the movie, said, ``The
beginning was good, very riveting, but the last part was too
serious.'' She also said the scenes of a communist re-education
camp were not realistic but did not elaborate. She declined to give
her name.
   The film about the life of China's last emperor, Henry Pu Yi,
will have its official Beijing premier Sept. 27. Italian director
Bernardo Bertolucci, the film's two producers and John Lone, who
played Pu Yi, will be invited to attend.
   Two Beijing theaters on Sunday began showing a 10-day special
run.
   The Chinese audiences, often noisy during movies, were usually
quiet.
   But scenes of zealous Red Guards marching alleged
counter-revolutionaries through the streets during the 1966-76
Cultural Revolution drew chatter and laughter. Some viewers joined
in the singing and chanting.
   The 49-cent ticket price, three times the usual cost, did not
seem to affect sales for Sunday's showings. Most moviegoers who
were questioned said they came to see why the film won nine Oscars,
including the award for best picture, at the Academy Awards in
April.
   After the showing, ``Pretty good'' and ``OK'' were typical
comments.
   A few people said they went to see actress Joan Chen, who played
the empress. Chen is a Chinese actress who went to the United
States in 1981.
   One man complained that ``using a foreign actor to depict Pu Yi
was hardly fitting.''
   A college student praised the film as historically accurate and
said he wanted to see it a second time.
   ``The Last Emperor,'' which opened in the United States in
December, was to be released in Chinese theaters in June but that
date was postponed. The Film Bureau, which must approve all foreign
films shown in China, said the time was needed to dub the film into
Chinese.
   But there was speculation that officials might be unhappy with
the film's treatment of Communist Party history and that cuts were
being made. The bureau denied that.
   Li Zongyue, an editor for China Film Press who has seen both the
original movie and the Chinese version several times, said minor
cuts were made generally of scenes deemed unsuitable for children.
   Capital Theater Manager Sun Guangyin said the responses of
moviegoers were mixed.
   Some viewers said they wanted to see ``Last Emperor'' again, but
others said it wasn't nearly as good as a 30-part Chinese
television series on Pu Yi, also called ``The Last Emperor'' and
nationally broadcast earlier this year.

   Riot squads broke up a protest
that began when 10,000 people marched through the capital Sunday to
mark the 20th anniversary of the Warsaw Pact invasion that crushed
the reforms of 1968.
   Baton-swinging police fired tear gas and charged the protesters
with dogs about two hours after a chanting, clapping crowd began
marching through the city. The march had dwindled to about 1,000
people when police moved in, beating at least two people and
dragging others away.
   Waving Czechoslovak flags, the crowd began a march in Wenceslas
Square after a rally where hundreds signed a petition calling for
democracy, human rights, the abolition of censorship and the
withdrawal of Soviet troops.
   Many chanted the name of Alexander Dubcek, who as Czechoslovak
Communist Party leader instituted the ``Prague Spring'' reforms
before Soviet-led troops invaded on Aug. 20-21, 1968.
   At least five people were detained at different sites Sunday,
including prominent activist Jan Urban. It was not known if Urban,
a member of a human rights group called Charter 77, was released.
   The crowd that left Wenceslas square was joined by thousands of
onlookers and the march swelled to about 10,000. Police made no
move to disperse the crowd until it had thinned and protesters
tried to return to the square.
   Police charged and dispersed the crowd, but no reports of
injuries were available. Reporters saw helmeted police beating at
least two people and two others were dragged away after shouting
``Dubcek'' and ``Freedom.''
   The official CTK news agency said in a brief dispatch that
``groups of people attempted disturbing actions'' in Wenceslas
Square.
   It was ``peaceful at the beginning. More prounounced attempts at
provocation were recorded ... after the crowd moved to the Old Town
Square and during a march through the streets of Prague,'' CTK
said. `The considerate and decisive action of the police prevented
riots.''
   In Moscow, an estimated 500 demonstrators gathered in a central
park. When they began chanting ``Prague, Prague,'' police charged
and dispersed the crowd. Several dozen people were taken away but
the number of arrests was not known.
   About 100 demonstrators staged a second rally along Moscow's
Arbat shopping mall, said Alexander Chuyev, a member of an
unsanctioned political party called the Democratic Union. He said
police arrested an unspecified number of protesters.
   Before the march in Prague, a group calling itself Independent
Peace Initiative earlier met in Wenceslas Square and drew up a
10-point petition. Peace campaigner Tomas Dvorak read it as
hundreds loudly applauded each point.
   Dvorak said the petition would be sent to Czechoslovak state,
government and party leaders and the state-run media.
   At one point, a policeman passed through the tightly packed
crowd and grabbed copies of the signed petitions. The crowd jeered
and yelled ``Shame.'' Reporters saw police spraying mace into the
face of at least one citizen.
   Earlier on Wenceslas Square, 200 people walked behind two
representatives of the Charter 77 movement, Eva Kanturkova and
Tomas Hradilek, who tried to lay flowers by the statue of King
Wenceslas.
   Uniformed police pushed back the two activists and others who
tried to lay flowers in memory of countrymen killed in street
violence after the invasion.
   Plainclothes men swiftly gathered up flowers thrown at the
monument as the crowd sang the Czech and Slovak national anthems
and applauded.
   Miss Kanturkova said she and Hradilek came to the square in
place of three group spokesmen detained Saturday as they walked to
the Soviet Embassy with an appeal to the Kremlin to tell the truth
about the 1968 invasion.
   A French reporter said one of the three, Bohumir Janat, told him
that he and group member Milos Hajek were released late Saturday
after a few hours in detention. An informed source said the third
man, Stanislav Devaty, was freed Sunday in his home town of
Gottwaldov.
   After the anthem singing, police detained at least two people
and a third wearing a Czechoslovak flag on his jacket was seized an
hour later.
   Outside a radio station, police checked the documents of eight
people who tried to lay flowers there and detained at least one.
   One man whose documents were checked, Vlastimil Kula, 37, said
he went to the square because ``it is the 20th anniversary of the
act the nation can't agree with.''
   When Aug. 21 dawned 20 years ago, this nation's 15.5 million
people woke up stunned to realize that their communist allies had
invaded to crush what official media call the danger of
counterrevolution and Czechoslovakia's withdrawal from the Warsaw
Pact.
   Prague's cautious communist leadership, installed to crush some
of the very innovations now favored in Moscow, recently embarked
upon carefully controlled economic reform and has allowed
independent groups and cultural activists more leeway.
   But Sunday's heavy police presence indicated the Prague
leadership will not tolerate renewed protests against the invasion.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass reiterated Friday that the
invasion was justified.

<TEXT>
   An estimated 2,500
demonstrators held a peaceful rally Sunday inside Cape Town's City
Hall to protest labor laws scheduled to go into effect next month.
   The rally, attended mainly by black workers and union leaders,
was organized by the Congress of South African Trade Unions, the
nation's largest labor federation.
   It called the rally to oppose the Labor Relations Amendment Bill
that will take effect Sept. 1. Union leaders say the measure will
make it more difficult to have legal strikes and gives employers
greater legal powers to settle labor disputes.
   Some employer organizations also have expressed reservations
about the bill, saying it could lead to more labor-management
confrontations.
   Millions of black workers stayed away from their jobs for three
days in June when the bill was being considered by the
white-controlled government.
   Meanwhile, police said Sunday that five blacks were killed in
townships around the southeastern city of Pietermaritzburg.
   It said police fired on a group of blacks stoning a private
house in Hammersdale township and three men were killed.
   A man was killed in the same area by a group of blacks and a man
was stabbed to death in Mphumalanga township, according to the
brief police report. It gave no further details.

   The man who bought the lakefront home of
former PTL television evangelist Jim Bakker is remodeling the
$685,000 house and is hopeful its notoriety will die down.
   ``It's just a house and it happens to be a little famous,''
Robert Rubino said of the 10,266-square-foot house.
   A lot of curious people still stroll down his driveway to look
at the house that once belonged to Bakker, who was forced from the
ministry in a sex and money scandal.
   Little evidence of the Bakkers' taste will be left once the
redecoration is complete, Rubino said.
   For example, the gold-plated swan bathroom fixtures and the
green carpet that covers most of the house will be removed, and a
19-by-22-foot closet will be changed into a bedroom.
   The four-bedroom, five-bathrom home has a 36-foot-long swimming
pool, a boat dock, a marble foyer, an exercise room and a music
room.
   Some of the furniture and appliances were included in the sale,
Rubino said, and he will keep most of the appliances, but the
Bakkers' furniture is just not his taste.
   ``I looked at the house and it was just what I wanted,'' he
said. ``I am going to make it into a very upbeat California look.''

<HEAD>Prayers Said for Soldiers Killed In IRA Bombing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British troops prayed Sunday for
eight fellow soldiers killed by an IRA bomb, and authorities seized
bomb-making equipment in the basement of Belfast's largest hospital.
   Members of the First Battalion of the Light Infantry and their
families remembered the dead at a private service at the army
barracks in the town of Omagh, near where the bomb went off Friday
50 miles west of Belfast.
   Soldiers also prayed at the Sir John Moore barracks in
Winchester, south of London, where the eight dead soldiers trained.
   Local residents placed two simple wreaths on a fence post near
the bombing site.
   Meanwhile, 27 soldiers injured in Friday's blast remained in the
hospital Sunday. Six were in serious condition, the army said.
   Two of the injured troops were in Belfast's Royal Victoria
Hospital, where police and British soldiers seized the equipment
used for making bombs, four handguns and ammunition in a basement
Sunday.
   No explosives were found, and patients had not been in danger,
said a city police official on condition on anonymity.
   Security forces have not linked the arms cache to a particular
group, the spokesman said.
   However, the Irish Republican Army has stepped up its bombing
campaign against British authorities in recent months. Friday's
blast came 11 weeks after an IRA bomb killed six soldiers in
Lisburn, outside Belfast.
   Friday's attack was the outlawed IRA's deadliest since 1982. It
brought to 26 the number of British military deaths in the summer
terror blitz.
   The predominantly Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule
in Northern Ireland and unite the 60 percent Protestant province
with the 95 percent Catholic Irish Republic.
   In Friday's attack, seven soldiers, ages 18 to 21, died when a
bomb in a parked car blew up the unmarked bus carrying them back to
their barracks from Belfast Airport, where they had just arrived
from furlough in mainland Britain. An eighth died Saturday of his
injuries.

<DATELINE>GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Helen Hayes was airlifted
to a hospital in this western Colorado city Sunday after her
heartbeat became irregular.
   Miss Hayes, 87, was visiting her son, actor James MacArthur, in
Crested Butte, a Rocky Mountain resort town about 10,000 feet above
sea level, when she began feeling ill, a doctor said.
   ``I really feel it was just the altitude that was bothering her.
But she was sent to Grand Junction to confirm whether or not she
had a heart attack,'' Dr. Dan Tullius told The Associated Press.
``She had an irregular heartbeat and it could be secondary to
altitude.
   ``We just flew her to Grand Junction. Mostly she needed to get
to a lower altitude and get a test to rule out whether she was
having a heart attack,'' he said.
   The doctor said Miss Hayes was conscious and not in pain when he
treated her.
   The silver-haired actress ended her theater career in 1971,
after 66 years, because of allergies to dust that aggravated her
chronic asthmatic bronchitis, but continued to work before the
camera and was active in causes, including the rights of the aged.
   She won a Tony, two Oscars and an Emmy, and in 1981 received the
Kennedy Center Honors for lifetime achievement. In 1980, she was
selected as one of 10 American artists to be commemorated on a gold
medallion issued by the Treasury Department.

   President Corazon Aquino said Sunday
she would not resign but would continue governing this factious
country because she had a covenant with the Filipino people and a
``contract with God.''
   Mrs. Aquino made no direct reference to the Aug. 13 demand by
Vice President Salvador Laurel that she step down and call new
presidential elections.
   But she told about 2,000 people at ceremonies marking the fifth
anniversary of the slaying of her husband, opposition leader
Benigno Aquino Jr., that forces bent on destabilizing the
Philippines were working against her.
   ``Every step we have taken toward progress has been challenged,
particularly at this time of the year, by those determined to see
this nation fail,'' Mrs. Aquino said.
   ``But you and I shall not let it ...'' she added. ``For my
mandate is with this nation, not with its enemies. My covenant is
with the constitution, our contract is with God.''
   She added: ``For my mandate is with this nation, not with is
enemies. My covenant is with the constitution, our contract is with
God.''
   In a letter to the president, Laurel had accused her
administration of incompetence and of failing to stem the 19-year
Communist rebellion.
   Laurel offered to resign if Mrs. Aquino did, but added that if
she refused, he would remain vice president and join the
opposition. Mrs. Aquino has so far not responded to Laurel in
writing.
   Last week, Laurel met with opposition leaders to discuss forming
a unified opposition party. But his call for a new election has
failed to gain the support of major politicians.
   The next presidential election is set for May 1992.
   Laurel and opposition leaders have charged that the Aquino
administration is rife with corruption. They have compared it to
the final years in office of ousted President Ferdinand Marcos.
   Mrs. Aquino came to power after Marcos was toppled by a
civilian-military uprising on Feb. 25, 1986. The revolt culminated
a wave of public outrage sparked by the Aug. 21, 1983,
assassination of her husband.
   He was murdered while leaving a jet under military escort. He
had just flown home after three years self-imposed exile in the
United States.

<NOTE>EDS: Adds 5 grafs with interview with Quayle's father.
^Bush Says He'll Take the Heat Over Quayle Controversy</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush said Sunday he'll ``take the heat''
over the controversy surrounding running mate Dan Quayle's military
service, a flap that one senior Republican predicted will linger
for a while.
   Democrats claimed it all showed their ticket has more stature.
   Bush told a pool of reporters as he flew to Chicago on Air Force
Two that Quayle has ``been thrown into a hornet's nest, but, you
know, I've been there. I've got to take the heat. I made the
decision. The buck stops right here.''
   The vice president said he had ``no hesitancy'' about keeping
Quayle on the ticket despite the controversy over the Indiana
senator using his wealthy family's influence to join the National
Guard during the Vietnam War.
   After arriving at the Springfield, Ill. airport Sunday afternoon
Bush hopped out of his limousine and greeted men and women members
of an Air National Guard unit.
   He said theirs was ``a very honorable service'' and that others
``ought not try to be making something wrong out of serving in that
way.''
   A little later, Bush leaped off a tram on the grounds of the
Illinois State Fair and walked over to an Air National Guard
exhibit, peering down the barrel of an unloaded antitank missile
launcher before playfully turning the weapon on reporters.
   Craig Fuller, Bush's chief of staff, said he and other campaign
officials are ``convinced that Dan Quayle did absolutely nothing
improper'' by seeking membership in the National Guard during the
Vietnam War.
   A day earlier, Bush himself had called the issue a ``tempest in
a teapot.''
   Fuller, appearing on the CBS television show ``Face The
Nation,'' said a review of Quayle's background after questions were
raised disclosed nothing new.
   He said taking Quayle off the ticket ``was never considered.''
   Bush and Quayle appeared together in Ohio early Sunday before
the vice president went off to the Illinois State Fair and Quayle
returned to Washington for a couple of days of private time to
chart the course of a campaign born less than a week ago at the
Republican National Convention in New Orleans.
   Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis taking Sunday
off at home in Boston and his running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of
Texas was relaxing at his Virginia farm.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, one of those Bush
passed over in his vice presidential selection process, said Sunday
he spoke with Bush campaign director James Baker about the National
Guard flap Saturday evening and ``he believes it's pretty much
behind them.''
   What does Dole think?
   ``I think it's going to last awhile,'' replied Dole to the
question put by an interviewer on NBC's ``Meet The Press.''
   Questioned about how Quayle could be picked over more
experienced and well-known senators, Dole said he thought ``Bush
decided to go for the generational thing.''
   The National Guard issue might not play well, he said. ``Right
now I would guess there are number of Reagan Democrats who are
going to remain undecided or maybe go the other way,'' he said.
   However, he said he believed the Bush-Quayle campaign would
allay those concerns as time goes on. Quayle can ``still be very
effective'' because of his expertise on certain issues, especially
defense, Dole said.
   House Democratic Whip Tony Coelho of California, also appearing
on the NBC program, said the question was not Quayle's service in
the National Guard, but rather Bush's judgment in choosing Quayle
as running mate over what he said were better qualified Republicans.
   ``Out of the 46 Republicans in the Senate, I think most people
would agree that Dan Quayle, at best, is 30th, or something like
that,'' said Coelho. ``Why did George Bush pick Dan Quayle? That's
got to be the question.''
   ``Is Dan Quaylequalified to be president of the United States?''
Coelho asked. ``I don't think he has the maturity. I don't think he
has had the experience. And for sure the one thing that we all look
at, I don't think he has shown the leadership over the years to do
the job.''
   Although Bush made a good speech at the convention, ``The
question really is whether or not George Bush is capable to make
the decisions when called upon,'' Coelho said. ``His first
presidential decision was Dan Quayle. Michael Dukakis' first
presidential decision was Lloyd Bentsen.''
   Dukakis campaign manager Susan Estrich, on ``Face The Nation,``
echoed Coelho's sentiments.
   ``Is this the man who is best qualified to be vice president of
the United States?'' she asked. If not, she said, ``At that point
the real issue is not Dan Quayle, it's George Bush and his
judgment, his decision to pass over some Republicans of real
national stature to choose Dan Quayle.''
   Meanwhile, Quayle's father told the Cleveland Plain Dealer that
his son didn't meet the academic requirements for Indiana
University Law School, but he met the dean and ``talked his way
in.''
   Newspaper publisher James C. Quayle also said that the
candidate's family ties helped him get a job as an investigator for
Indiana's attorney general.
   The law school admissions dean, G. Kent Frandsen, was a
Republican city judge in Lebanon, Ind., where the Quayle-Pulliam
family owns the local newspaper.
   James Quayle told the newspaper that an executive who worked for
Quayle's late grandfather, Eugene C. Pulliam, owner of Indiana's
largest newspapers, arranged an interview for Quayle with Theodore
L. Sendack, then attorney general of the state.
   Quayle became chief investigator in the attorney general's
consumer office and later administrative assistant to Edgar
Whitcomb, then Indiana's Republican governor.

   A train brakeman battling a bout of
stomach flu whistled ``Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain'' Sunday and
emerged as the world's best warbler for the fourth time in the 11th
annual International Whistle-Off.
   ``People ask me all the time how to whistle and all I say is
`pucker up and start blowing','' said Roy Thoreson, 57, a Canadian
Pacific Railway brakeman from Calgary, Alberta.
   ``I really think whistling is a God-given gift like opera
singing,'' said Thoreson, who topped the field of 30 contestants
for the grand championship and a trip to Mexico or the Caribbean.
   Whistlers from 15 states and Canada competed.
   Thoreson also whistled ``Sweet Georgia Brown'' in capturing the
title in the solo popular male division.
   The juggling and magic acts he performed while whistling ``Day
at Fair'' earned him second in the novelty division. He whistled
Brahms' ``Hungarian Dance Number Five'' and placed third in the
solo classical male division.
   Thoreson, who also was the event's grand champion in 1979, 1980
and 1984, said he began whistling when he was 6 and ``practiced 40
years before getting on stage'' in 1977.
   ``I can hold notes and I've got good breath control,'' Thoreson
said. ``But basically, I just whistle and have fun. A lot of it
gets down to the shape of your mouth and I'm blessed to be a
natural whistler.''

   President Corazon Aquino said Sunday
she would not resign but would continue governing this factious
country because she had a covenant with the Filipino people and a
``contract with God.''
   Mrs. Aquino made no direct reference to the Aug. 13 demand by
Vice President Salvador Laurel that she step down and call new
presidential elections.
   But she told about 2,000 people at ceremonies marking the fifth
anniversary of the slaying of her husband, opposition leader
Benigno Aquino Jr., that forces bent on destabilizing the
Philippines were working against her.
   ``Every step we have taken toward progress has been challenged,
particularly at this time of the year, by those determined to see
this nation fail,'' Mrs. Aquino said.
   ``But you and I shall not let it ...'' she added. ``For my
mandate is with this nation, not with its enemies. My covenant is
with the constitution, our contract is with God.''
   She added: ``For my mandate is with this nation, not with is
enemies. My covenant is with the constitution, our contract is with
God.''
   In a letter to the president, Laurel had accused her
administration of incompetence and of failing to stem the 19-year
Communist rebellion.
   Laurel offered to resign if Mrs. Aquino did, but added that if
she refused, he would remain vice president and join the
opposition. Mrs. Aquino has so far not responded to Laurel in
writing.
   Last week, Laurel met with opposition leaders to discuss forming
a unified opposition party. But his call for a new election has
failed to gain the support of major politicians.
   The next presidential election is set for May 1992.
   Laurel and opposition leaders have charged that the Aquino
administration is rife with corruption. They have compared it to
the final years in office of ousted President Ferdinand Marcos.
   Mrs. Aquino came to power after Marcos was toppled by a
civilian-military uprising on Feb. 25, 1986. The revolt culminated
a wave of public outrage sparked by the Aug. 21, 1983,
assassination of her husband.
   He was murdered while leaving a jet under military escort. He
had just flown home after three years self-imposed exile in the
United States.

   A powerful earthquake rumbled through
the mountains of Nepal and eastern India before dawn Sunday,
triggering landslides and floods, destroying houses and killing
more than 400 people, officials and news reports said.
   More than 3,000 were injured in the quake, which seismologists
called the deadliest to strike the Himalayan region since 1950.
   Indian officials said at least 125 people were killed and 2,000
injured in the eastern state of Bihar. Government television put
the number of dead at more than 300.
   State-run Radio Nepal said at least 281 people were killed in
towns near the border, and Nepalese officials said more than 1,000
were injured.
   The quake also jolted parts of northern Bangladesh and the
capital of Dhaka, but there were no reports of casualties or damage.
   The Seismological Observatory in New Delhi said the quake
occurred at 4:40 a.m. and measured 6.5 on the Richter scale. The
quake lasted for about one minute and aftershocks continued for
about an hour, observatory director H.N. Srivastava said.
   Srivastava said the temblor was centered about 40 to 50 miles
northeast of Darbhanga, a town of about 800,000 in Bihar. The
location puts the epicenter almost on the India-Nepal border.
   Officials said most of the deaths occurred in Darbhanga, Munger
and Madhubani districts. More than 25,000 houses in those areas
were destroyed, they said.
   V.K. Sharma, a deputy secretary in the Bihar government,
predicted the death toll would rise because many people were
seriously injured.
   Landslides knocked out communication links on both sides of the
border, preventing officials from obtaining information about
casualties or damage from the remote, hardest hit areas.
   ``The tolls have come in only from urban areas,'' Sharma said in
a telephone interview from Patna, the Bihar capital.
   The monsoon rains, which hit the subcontinent in late June and
usually continue through September, also were hampering rescue
operations. More than 50 villages were flooded after the quake
shifted embankments.
   In Nepal, Shailendra Kumar Upadhyaya, a Foreign Ministry
official, said at least 500 people were injured and thousands of
houses collapsed from the quake's impact. But other officials said
later Sunday that more than 1,000 were hurt.
   ``Most of (the victims were) buried alive under collapsed
houses,'' said Indra Shrestha, a social worker involved in the
rescue operations at Dharan Bazar, a township of about 100,000
people about 18 miles from the Indian border.
   In the ancient township of Bhaktapur, about 11 miles south of
Katmandu, Mayor Assa Kazi Basakala surveyed the damage.
   ``The Germans came and helped restore most of this town to its
original, traditional splendor'' in 1960, he said. ``I don't know
how we'll rebuild now.''
   Officials in both countries were rushing medical teams, clothes
and other relief material to the disaster aras. Indian Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi planned to visit the region Monday to survey
the damage.
   Most of the victims were asleep in their beds when the quake
struck. Witnesses said windows and doors rattled, buildings cracked
and people ran screaming from their homes.
   ``My bed rattled, then it began swinging,'' said R.N. Rudra, a
resident of Patna. ``My dogs began barking and I ran out of the
house.''
   The quake also was felt in the heavily populated states of Uttar
Pradesh, West Bengal and Orissa, United News of India said. Reports
of injuries came from the Darjeeling district of West Bengal, the
news agency said, but no deaths were reported.
   The Press Trust of India news agency said 17 children were
killed in Darbhanga town, which is about 560 miles southeast of New
Delhi, when a school hostel caved in.
   In the neighboring Madhubani district, a river jumped its banks
after the quake shifted embankments and flooded nearly 50 villages,
the United News of India said.
   Officials said at least 45 people died in the district, but it
was not known whether the deaths were due to floods or collapsing
houses.
   The Bhootahi Balan River continued to rise more than 12 hours
after the quake, and the army was alerted to the possibility that
troops might be sent to help rescue operations, the officials said.
   The Richter scale measures the energy released by an earthquake
as gauged by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A quake
of magnitude 6 is capable of causing severe damage.
   The worst quake on record in the Indian subcontinent occurred in
1935, when at least 30,000 people were killed in Quetta, India, in
what is now Pakistan. In 1950, an estimated 1,530 were killed in
the Himalayan foothills of India's Assam state.
   Nepal's deadliest earthquake occurred in 1934. More than 10,700
people died.

   About 10,000 people Sunday marched
through the capital shouting ``Freedom!'' and ``Russians go home!''
on the 20th anniversary of the Warsaw Pact invasion that crushed
the reforms of 1968.
   Waving Czechoslovak flags, the crowd began a spontaneous march
from Wenceslas Square after an impromptu rally where hundreds
signed a petition calling for the withdrawal of Soviet troops, free
elections, the abolition of censorhsip, democracy and human rights.
   Many chanted the name of Alexander Dubcek, who as Czechoslovak
Communist Party leader instituted the ``Prague Spring'' reforms
before Soviet-led troops and tanks invaded on Aug. 20-21, 1968.

   While the Republicans almost certainly will be
blessed with a buoyant economy through Election Day, inflation and
rising interest rates could shove the country into a recession as
early as next spring, some economists are warning.
   A few analysts are forecasting a downturn for next year, and
many who aren't say it will take luck to avoid a recession.
   Ironically, one of the things that has them worried is that
economic growth has been so robust lately.

   Iran charged Sunday that Iraqi troops
violated a cease-fire hours after it started by firing shots near a
U.N. observer team in the central sector of the front.
   Shipping sources in the Persian Gulf said two U.N. patrol craft,
one described as a speedboat, were patrolling the strategic Strait
of Hormuz, the gateway to the gulf, and the Shatt Al-Arab waterway,
which marks the southern boundary between Iran and Iraq.
   It was the first report of U.N. craft on patrol since the
cease-fire took effect early Saturday morning after eight years of
hostilities that claimed an estimated 1 million lives.

   The retreat of Contra rebels and
supporters to remote Honduran base camps threatens the survival of
the insurgency to oust Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.
   The action also reverses months of political and military
advances.
   Officials at the rebel camps said more than 14,000 Contra troops
and civilians crossed the Coco River border in the past four months
into Yamales in the steep Honduran mountains. Rebel officers
estimate that no more than 2,000 fighters remain in the northern
Nicaraguan hills.
   The rebels blame the withdrawal on the United States, which on
Feb. 29 cut off military aid _ a bargaining chip, they say, for
discussions to end the war that began in 1981. Congress has voted
to grant only non-lethal aid distributed in Honduras.

   Veterans Administration managers frequently
made wrong decisions on veterans' disability claims in their haste
to ``make themselves look good'' and win pay bonuses for meeting
production quotas, House investigators said Sunday.
   The House Government Operations Committee said the VA tried to
cover up its mistakes by deliberately under-reporting the error
rate to committee investigators.
   The panel suggested that Congress end a 55-year-old prohibition
and allow veterans who are denied benefits to appeal their cases in
federal court. Their present last resort is a VA appeals board,
where veterans won less than 13 percent of the time under the
now-abolished quota system.

   The bartender's dreaded cry of ``last orders''
will not ring out in English pubs Monday afternoon for the first
time since World War I.
   Instead, thanks to new laws that permit all-day drinking, pubs
that open at 11 a.m. can continue serving beer and spirits until
closing time at 11 p.m.
   ``We're hoping for a big crowd,'' said Mick McCoy, assistant
manager of the Hog In The Pound pub near the Oxford Street shopping
district. ``We're stacked up (with beer). We've taken on a couple
of extra people, just in case.''
   Under the old system, pubs were forced to close from 3 p.m.
until 5:30 p.m. The bartender's warning at 2:50 p.m. created a rush
for one last pint, and 10 minutes later, to the cry of ``time,
gentlemen, please,'' the fun was over.

   Death may be a constant but the rituals

bereavement illustrates.
   Old embalming tools, a 1917 Ford Model-T hearse that doubled as
an ambulance, intricately braided wreaths of human hair and a
1,500-pound glass casket are some of the memorabilia in Fred
Hunter's funeral museum, one of a handful in the United States.
   ``If we can teach a little to a student, and help families
understand the history, that death is natural ... this helps them
understand there's a heritage to this process. The whole funeral
process is a part of growing, of letting go,'' said Hunter.

   Tune in this week for the next episode in the
family feud over R.P. Scherer Corp.
   Stockholders have been pitted between the capsule maker's
largest shareholder, Karla Scherer Fink, and her estranged husband,
Scherer executive Peter Fink, in a proxy battle that peaked at the
company's annual meeting last Wednesday.
   ``I feel like over the last few weeks I've been watching nothing
more than a live episode of `Dynasty,' and frankly, I think it's
pathetic,'' said Arthur Hudson, a shareholder and former vice
president.
   Mrs. Fink, daughter of the company's late founder, was seeking
three board seats for her faction, whose mission is to sell the
company. Not surprisingly, management has touted the not-for-sale
position.
   Results of the vote are expected when the company reconvenes its
annual meeting at 10 a.m. EDT this Wednesday.
   Yet even if directors backing a sale are elected, analyst Dean
Gulis at the Detroit investment firm Roney & Co., said, ``You go
back to the basic, fundamental issue here'' _ and that is, he said,
does anyone want to buy the company.
   Scherer's stock is trading around $26 a share, sharply higher
than the $16-a-share selling price of a year ago. But analysts
attribute the increase to the boardroom pathos, which has put the
spotlight on the company.
   Lawrence Obstfeld, an analyst with Commonwealth Associates in
New York, said he doubted any purchase offer would approach the
$26-a-share level.
   ``I don't see how anybody could pay that much,'' he said.
   Analysts note that the biggest profits in the pharmaceutical
industry come from companies that produce new products; Scherer is
engaged only in packaging.
   ``I think it is a fine company in and of itself, but as a
possible acquisition for a drug company or chemical company, it
doesn't make sense,'' he said.
   Mrs. Fink, supported by her brother, John S. Scherer, thinks
this is an opportune time to sell the company because there is no
guarantee Scherer's recent record annual sales of $290.7 million
and earnings of $15.1 million will continue.
   ``John and I watched our father build this company. He made our
mother and their children partners in it nearly 50 years ago ...
and I believe he would have heartily endorsed a sale,'' she said.
Mrs. Fink and her brother control about 38 percent of the company.
   Peter Fink, Scherer's president and chief executives officer,
said there have been no offers and stressed that shareholders would
profit most if the company remained independent. He said he is
trying to prevent the dispute from becoming a distraction for
Scherer's 2,800 employees.
   ``I'd rather not refer to them as damage control measures,'' he
said after last week's stockholder meeting. ``We've tried to
contain the diversion to as few people as possible.''
   Some stockholders say the company will be damaged whatever the
outcome the family dispute, which saw Mrs. Fink file for divorce
weeks after the board rejected her sale proposal.
   ``What we are really witnessing here is the wounding of a unique
and special company,'' Hudson told about 200 people at last week's
meeting.
   Mrs. Fink says she just wants what is best for stockholders.
   Four months ago Mrs. Fink rejected a suggestion by some
directors that the company pay a one-time dividend that would
benefit her and her brother, in return for reducing their voting
power.
   ``I think that's the kind of deal I'd try to cut right now,''
Gulis said.

   New York state's venerable Catskill
Mountain resorts, once known collectively as the ``borscht belt''
because of their ethnic flavor and abundance of food, are trying to
update their image.
   These days, some resorts are trying to be part of the ``sushi
belt.''
   Tourism officials distribute brochures in Japan praising the
region's golf courses. The tables at the golf clubhouse of the
Concord Hotel, the region's largest, have buffet menus printed in
both English and Japanese.
   It's just one indication of how times are changing for the
region, whose old ways were popularized in the romantic movie
``Dirty Dancing.''
   Margo Jones doesn't cringe at the mention of borscht, the beet
and cabbage soup popular at the predominantly Jewish hotels, but
Sullivan County's publicity director quickly steers the
conversation to a new nickname _ CatskilLand.
   The name, she said, is meant to convey the Catskills' more
active image as a center for sports and recreation.
   ``I don't think we'll ever get away from that ethnic image and I
don't think we want to,'' Jones said. ``Some of the things we like
about the image are the sense of tradition, a sense of family and a
warmth that you don't get from a chain hotel.''
   Milton Kutsher, for example, still prowls around the huge resort
in Monticello his family has run since 1907.
   Nevertheless, many of the 500 resorts that once dotted the area
have folded or converted to other uses; about a dozen giants now
handle the bulk of the visitors.
   Like many resort areas close to big cities, the Catskills _
about a two-hour ride from New York City _ began to fade as a
tourist destination in recent years. Air travel made other resorts,
both in the United States, the Caribbean and overseas _ more
accessible.
   The summertime routine of large meals broken up by an occasional
game of ``Simon Says'' was also less appealing to newer generations
of Catskills visitors. Even the hotels' nightclubs, which gave
birth to dozens of Hollywood careers, didn't seem so attractive
anymore.
   It was a case of adapt or die, and the Catskills did a better
job than areas like the Adirondack Mountains in upstate New York,
said Dan Lee, travel industry analyst for the investment firm
Drexel Burnham.
   ``To some extent, the times are changing back toward the
Catskills,'' Lee said. ``You have a rise in dual working couples.
That segment has money, but what they don't have is time. More
likely a two-career couple wants to take three days off and go
someplace nearby and relax and have a lot of activities there.''
   That's why ``CatskilLand's'' color brochure shows a young couple
whacking a tennis ball, dipping into a swimming pool and hitting a
golf ball. Skiiers and other weekend athletes are most welcome.
   Resort owners continue to use their imaginations to draw guests.
Grossinger's hosted the first ``singles only'' weekend back in
1962; a concept updated with an '80s twist at the Concord resort,
which publishes its own newsletter with personal advertisements.
   Hotels also have recently sponsored special weekends for single
parents and for infertile couples, Jones said.
   The Catskills' crowds also aren't as predictable as they used to
be. The families who still come to the Catskills for their bar
mitzvahs now room side by side with corporate executives on
retreats or training seminars, Kutsher said.
   At West Coast travel shows, Jones said she's known as ``the golf
lady'' among Japanese tourists who enjoy the relatively uncrowded
Catskills links.
   Many of the large hotels are also expanding their services to
include condominiums offered for use by time-sharing vacationers.
   While the Catskills can claim a revival _ Jones said her office
had 101,000 inquiries from tourists in 1986 compared to 24,000 in
1980 _ it can't say the comeback is complete.
   Brown's Hotel, one of the top resorts, filed for bankruptcy last
month, although the hotel remains open. Grossinger's, once the king
of the Catskills, has been closed since 1986, although its new
owners promise a remodeled resort will debut in 1989.
   ``It hurt us a lot individually because we were friends with
these people,'' Kutsher said of Grossinger's closing. ``But
Grossinger's will rise out of the ashes.''
   If it does, its new owners hope it will typify the new
Catskills. The newly named Grossinger's Resort and Spa will contain
some non-kosher restaurants and townhouses, said Bernie Roth, the
resort's general manager.

   Ashland Oil Inc. spends millions of
dollars to improve education in this country, but the company's
name will be missing from the latest attack on the high school
dropout problem.
   A series of 30-second television and radio spots and newspaper
and magazine ads will be released nationwide this week and be
identified as public-service announcements from two not-for-profit
organizations: the Council for State Governments in Lexington and
the Advertising Council in New York.
   Ashland donated materials and services for the ads but chose to
remove its name from them, remain anonymous and give credit to the
two not-for profit groups _ an action described as unique and
unprecedented by both councils and the National Dropout Prevention
Center at Clemson University.
   ``It is an excellent public awareness program about the dropout
crisis in America,'' said Dr. Jay Smink, the center's executive
director.
   ``When more parents, communities and corporations learn about
the potential we are losing, we are more likely to get them
involved in projects to keep youngsters in school,'' Smink said.
   The goal of the campaign _ to be kicked off Monday at a
Lexington news conference _ is to help reduce government statistics
showing that 682,000 students _ an average of 3,789 daily _
disappeared from their classrooms during the 1985-86 school year.
   ``The figures staggered us, and we decided to expand a program
that we've had in place about a year,'' said Dan Lacy, Ashland's
vice president for corporate communications.
   Ashland had previously launched an anti-dropout campaign in
Kentucky and West Virginia, using all media to emphasize the
importance of a high school diploma. Educators in both states
reported the campaign had an impact on youngsters who saw the
advertising.
   The idea wasn't new for Ashland, which has distributed at least
$10 million in the past five years in scholarships and college
endowments. The total does not include money spent in other fields
of education by Ashland.
   ``We approached the Advertising Council ... and asked if it
would be interested in running the program nationally, like the
ones it did on Smokey the Bear and drinking and driving,'' Lacy
said.
   There was one hitch. ``The council must have a non-profit
organization as a sponsor,'' Lacy explained.
   But Ashland found one in the Council of State Governments.
   All material that Ashland had used in its two-state drive was
donated to Doe-Anderson Advertising of Louisville for use in the
national campaign. The agency's services also were donated.
   ``Our logo was stripped from the advertisements and replaced
with that of the two councils,'' said Harry Wiley, Ashland's
director of advertising and communications.
   One of two tapes going to television stations depicts a
depressed youngster sitting in a corner of his garage. A few feet
away, an expensive sports car rests on cinder blocks.
   The narrator explains that ``two years ago, this car was the
most important thing in Joey's life. He spent every spare dime he
had on it. He even quit high school to get a job so he could have
the hottest ride in town.
   ``Today, the job is gone,'' the narrator continues. ``The car
doesn't work anymore and, without a high school diploma, neither
does Joey.
   ``Winners never quit. Stay in school,'' the ad concludes.
   The second tape depicts a teen-age mother clutching an infant.
   She tells the audience:
   ``Making ends meet hasn't been easy with three of us at home.
Jobs are pretty scarce around here, especially since neither my
husband nor me finished school.
   ``But it's going to be different for this one. He's going to
stay in high school if I have to tie him to his chair. Sometimes, I
wish someone had done me that way.''
   The tape ends with this plea: ``Stay in school. Someone's future
could depend on it.''
   Wiley estimated it will cost Ashland about $50,000 for mailing
the ads to the media. ``The packages will contain a brief summary
of how the project came about, but this is the only recognition we
will receive.''
   John Hamby, the National Dropout Prevention Center's assistant
director, said, ``There are many, many reasons why kids give up on
education. Any project that attempts to keep them from becoming a
statistic has to be a plus.''
   Hamby said studies have shown many girls cite pregnancy and
marriage as their reasons for abandoning education plans while boys
tend to blame their dislike for school.
   Both groups also mention economic reasons, Hamby said. Dropout
rates are higher among single-parent and lower-income families, he
added.
   Kentucky's dropout rate has been declining, and Ashland's
commercials, which began in August 1987, have been a factor, said
Dr. Tony Collins, director of pupil attendance in the state
Department of Education.
   In the 1983-84 school year, there were 14,224 dropouts in
Kentucky, but that number shrank to 9,633 for 1986-87.
   ``Those commercials have to get part of the credit,'' Collins
said.
   Businessmen who saw the ads came up with suggestions to help
dropouts, and Kentucky now has more residents going into the
General Education Diploma program than in past years, Collins said.
   ``And for the first time in our history, people are passing in
greater numbers than those who are quitting school,'' he said.

<HEAD>Seed Treatment Being Developed For Corn Borers; Still 2 Years Away</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN P. ROSENFELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agricultural researchers in Iowa are
reporting some success in using seeds pretreated with an
insecticide to fight European corn borers, pests the government
estimates cost U.S. farmers $400 million a year in damage and
control expenses.
   Pretreating seeds with a thiodicarb solution before planting has
been found as effective in controlling corn borers as any spray now
on the market, yet is more economical and appears to be safer to
the environment, said Edwin C. Berry of the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's Corn Insects Lab in Ankeny.
   But the process isn't ready for farm use yet.
   Berry said the treatment is in its third year of tests and that
another year of research is planned.
   ``We're interested in learning why it is effective in some
hybrids and not in others,'' he said.
   Berry also said researchers want to know if the mechanical
action of mixing the seeds with the chemical solution affects seed
quality or influences the action of insecticides.
   In addition, the chemical seed treatment has yet to be approved
for commercial use by the Environmental Protection Agency and its
Des Moines developer, Gustafson Inc., says the process is still two
years away from the marketplace.
   Researchers also have been experimenting with natural controls
of corn borers through the interaction of an insect, the green
lacewing; and a microbe, Nosema pyrausta.
   The lacewing eats corn borer eggs and larvae, and the
microorganism infects larvae and borer eggs with a disease that is
fatal to the borer and most other insects, but not the lacewing,
according to the USDA.
   ``Because most insecticides that kill the corn borer indirectly
kill the microorganism, researchers will try next to determine how
farmers can maintain natural Nosema pyrausta populations with
tilling practices, crop management and less pesticide,'' the
Agricultural Research Service reports.
   In the seed treatment, seeds are mechanically tumbled in a
solution of the insecticide thiodicarb before planting.
   As the corn grows, the chemical is absorbed throughout the
plant's stalks and leaves and the insect feeding on the plant dies,
Berry says.
   Corn borers cause their crop damage in their worm or larvae
stage before maturing to adult moths. There are two to three
generations to each growing season, according to Berry.
   The larvae enters the plant and causes damage by eating through
conductive tissues, interrupting the flow of nutrients. If it
enters a corn stalk or ear, it weakens the plant and makes it
susceptible to wind damage.
   Because the insect is on the plant's surface for only a short
period of time before tunneling, it is especially difficult to
combat with a spray, says Berry.
   ``This is why a systematic or seed treatment is so
encouraging,'' he says.
   Thiodicarb already is being used as a corn rootworm insecticide
that is sprayed just before insect infestation, and Berry said it
was routinely evaluated as part of research attempts to find
materials that are environmentally safer and more effective.
   Through early tests, researchers found the lowest concentrations
of chemicals that proved effective against corn borers.
   ``Depending on the strain of corn, we can achieve as good a
control with seed treatment as with conventional technology and it
is more economical,'' Berry said, controlling 70 percent to 80
percent of the insect population. He also said the seed treatment
puts less pesticide in the environment and has no known side
effects.
   In spraying, 80 percent of the insecticide misses the target
area, he said.
   Ray Knake, northern regional manager for research and
development for Gustafson, said his company is developing the
chemical for seed treatment use for the international company
Rhone-Poulenc, which is registering such use of thiodicarb with the
EPA.
   He estimated the treatment would cost farmers a couple of
dollars an acre.
   Knake said a simple mixer is being developed for farm use so
that farmers need not come in contact with the chemical while
treating seeds. He says the chemical breaks down so rapidly in the
soil that it is environmentally safe.
   While many details need to be worked out, Gustafson anticipates
selling the insecticide for on-farm treatment, leaving it up to
farmers to decide how much of their seed to treat and saving seed
companies from investing in large stocks of treated seeds, Knake
says.

<HEAD>Armtek Reports Negotiations with Third Party</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Armtek Corp., which has rejected a $550
million buyout offer from Mark IV Industries Inc., says it is
negotiating with a third party interested in buying the plastics
and chemicals company.
   The announcement Friday came one day after Mark IV sweetened its
offer for all of Armtek's stock to $44 a share from its original
$40-a-share bid.
   Armtek's board, which rejected Mark IV's original share as
inadequate, has not responded to the latest offer.
   The company said it informed the Securities and Exchange
Commission that negotiations with the third party ``may be
dependent upon future actions of Mark IV Industries with respect to
the amended offer.''
   Armtek earlier said it would consider a third-party acquisition,
and in its SEC filing, the company said it was also considering
recapitalization proposals.
   Investors apparently expect bidding for Armtek to continue. The
company's stock rose $1 a share to $46.50 in New York Stock
Exchange trading Friday.
   Armtek is facing four class action suits in Delaware, where it
is incorporated, from shareholders who charge the company's
directors are trying to thwart the Mark IV takeover attempt and
haven't satisfactorily explored the offer.
   One suit claims Armtek's directors have ``embarked upon a course
of action designed to entrench themselves in the management and
control of Armtek and to protect and enhance their personal
financial benefits'' at the expense of shareholders.
   Armtek, formerly known as Armstrong Rubber Co., is a supplier of
engineered drive and heat exchange systems, modules and components
and specialty polymers. It had $1.2 billion in sales last year.
   Two month ago, Armtek sold its largest unit, Armstrong Tire Co.,
to the Italian tire maker Pirelli Group for $197 million, capping a
corporate restructuring.
   Mark IV, based in West Amherst, N.Y., produces professional
audio, technical and aerospace products. The company had 1987 sales
of $292 million.

<HEAD>Iran Plans to Repair Oil Facilities Hit In War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BLANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran will repair vital oil facilities
battered in the war with Iraq at ``maximum speed'' as soon as the
United Nation-sponsored cease-fire proves to be durable, Oil
Minister Golamreza Aqazadeh says.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia, quoted Aqazadeh as saying Saturday Tehran will also go
ahead with major oil industry projects to boost exports, refining
capacity and exploration and expand its energy industry.
   Rebuilding its oil industry, particularly its seven existing
refineries which were badly hit, is one of Tehran's top priorities
now that the shooting has stopped.
   Aqazadeh said the Iranians want to bolster oil exports as
quickly as possible to fund the massive task of reconstruction.
   Before the cease-fire, Iran's government had projected oil
earnings of around $9 billion for this year. But weak oil prices
were expected to reduce that figure.
   Iran is currently producing around 2.3 million barrels of oil a
day, the output quota set by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
   Its current export level is an estimated 1.7 million barrels a
day, despite Iraqi efforts to choke Tehran's economic lifeline.
   Iraq's powerful air force concentrated much of its bombing
offensive on Iran's oil facilities and tankers during the
8-year-old war.
   Aqazadeh said a new oil loading terminal at Gavaneh in the
northern end of the Persian Gulf began operations soon after the
gulf war cease-fire took effect Saturday.
   Aqazadeh said the big refinery at Abadan in Khuzestan province,
put out of action early in the war, will be rebuilt and expanded
into ``one of the most sophisticated refineries of its kind.''
   The refinery, with a capacity of 630,000 barrels a day, was the
biggest in the world before it was knocked out by the Iraqis.
   The minister said another major refinery at Isfahan was now
operating at its pre-war capacity of around 200,000 barrels a day
after being bombed 15 times during the conflict.
   He did not mention the other refineries that were bombed.
Earlier this year, Western experts estimated that Iran's overall
refinery capacity of 700,000 barrels a day had been reduced by more
than one-third because of war damage.
   That forced the Iranians to import unprecedented amounts of
refined products, such as aviation fuel and kerosene, from abroad.
   Aqazadeh said Iran will push ahead with plans to build a new oil
refinery with a capacity of 220,000 barrels a day and a $1.5
billion petrochemical complex at the western city of Arak.
   The Iranians have also announced plans to build two other
smaller refineries in Tehran and the port of Taheri, midway down
the gulf near offshore oil and gas fields.
