<HEAD>Reagan to Recommend Moscow Embassy to be Razed and Rebuilt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan will recommend that the
almost-complete U.S. Embassy in Moscow be destroyed and rebuilt
because of fears it contains sophisticated eavesdropping devices,
The Washington Post reported in its Thursday editions.
   The newspaper quoted State Department sources as saying the
president's decision was expected to be announced Thursday.
   It probably would cost $300 million and take five years to build
a new eight-story embassy on the same site with materials imported
from the United States and kept under heavy guard after they arrived
in the Soviet Union, the paper reported.
   State Department sources have said that Secretary of State George
Shultz recommended the move to Reagan.
   The Reagan administration believes the embassy building, which
was mostly completed by 1985, includes structural elements riddled
with sophisticated devices that were intended for eavesdropping.
However, details on those findings have not been released.
   The current plan, the Post reported, is to fabricate the
building's main elements in the United States, ship them to the
Soviet Union, keep them under heavy guard and have the building
assembled by U.S. workers taken to Moscow for the construction
project.
   The embassy building originally was to have been completed by
1983. Reagan's recommendation would be made to Congress, and
officials said they believed lawmakers would insist on a full study
of the matter. Congress has adjourned for the year.
   State Department officials said that while the U.S. embassy is
being constructed, Soviet officials in Washington will be barred
from occupying their long-completed embassy office building.

   The future is bleak for many children in
America's cities unless the next president and Congress make a
commitment to solving some of their problems, a Massachusetts mayor
said Wednesday.
   ``Too many children in our cities have no future, no future at
all unless we, as a nation, act on the problems they face today,''
said Theodore D. Mann, mayor of Newton, Mass.
   Mann is chairman of the human development committee of the U.S.
Conference of Mayors, which on Wednesday released ``A Status Report
on Children in America's Cities.''
   The report ``calls attention to our collective failure as a
nation to respond to these problems'' Mann said of the 52-city
survey of mayors and human service officials.
   The study identifies drug abuse, weaknesses in education systems,
the lack of affordable child care, teen-age pregnancy and school
dropouts as key problems which have grown worse in the last five
years in 80 percent of the cities surveyed.
   Officials said low-income children are confronted with the
additional problems of homelessness and the lack of access to
medical and mental health care.
   Kevin Moriarity, director of human services for San Antonio,
Texas, recounted some of the survey's gloomier statistics: three of
10 children in the cities surveyed lived in poverty in 1986; one in
five was on welfare and received food stamps; 38 percent dropped out
of school between the ninth grade and their scheduled high school
graduation in the class of 1988; 15 percent of the babies born in
1986 were born to teen-age mothers; and a 12.6 percent infant
mortality rate plagued the cities during that year.
   Among survey cities Irvine, Calif., had the lowest overall
poverty rate and child poverty rate in 1986 at 4.1 percent and 3.3
percent, respectively. The city with the highest 1986 overall
poverty rate and child poverty rate was Camden, N.J., at 42.3
percent and 61.1 percent, respectively.
   Meanwhile, the Urban Institute released a study, based on 1979
data, that showed that 17.1 percent of U.S. children lived in
families with income below the poverty level. The poverty rate for
children was 5.1 percent in Sweden and Switzerland and 8.2 percent
in West Germany.
   The Urban Institute study said the high U.S. poverty rate among
children occurs because programs for the poor cover fewer people and
provide fewer benefits than programs in other industrialized
countries. Officials said the United States' relative standing had
changed little, if any, since 1979.
   Mann said the mayors' conference was not interested in placing
blame for the current problems but was calling for a national
partnership between the business community and federal, state and
local governments.
   However most speakers at Wednesday's session of the U.S.
Conference of City Human Service Officials, an affiliate of the
mayors' conference, emphasized increasing the federal government's
role, both financially and in providing policy direction.
   ``We've got to have more federal assistance, not just in funding
but in policy,'' said James Moran, mayor of Alexandria, Va.
   ``We feel that we have done as much as we can and sometimes
more,'' Moran said. ``We are losing middle-class residents because
of high property taxes'' used to pay for needed services he said.
   Moran said his community, a prosperous suburb of Washington,
faces a growing problem of homelessness fueled by a high dropout
rate. He cited an 18.6 percent dropout rate in 1987 among teen-age
girls due to pregnancy.
   Among the cities surveyed, Norfolk, Va., had the highest dropout
rate in the class of 1988. Seventy-one percent of Norfolk's 1988
class left school from the ninth grade and 37 percent of the rest of
those eligible for graduation in 1988 left in the tenth grade.
   But George D. Raiss, a spokesman for the Norfolk public schools,
called the group's numbers ``completely erroneous.''
   The study did not take into account Norfolk's transient
population _ the city is home to the world's largest naval facility
_ and the study counted as dropouts students who actually
transferred from one school to another, who transferred out of the
district and those who were not promoted for academic reasons, among
others.
   According to figures supplied to the state of Virginia, Norfolk
had a dropout rate of 8.1 percent in 1988, which was down from 9.1
percent in 1987 and 15.8 percent in 1981.
   The average wait for subsidized child care among surveyed cities
was almost 10 months, while the wait for non-subsidized child care
was 18 weeks, with costs running an average of $78 weekly at a
center-based facility. Nationally, half the children under 6 have
mothers who work outside the home.
   The group did not identify a specific amount they thought was
needed from the federal government to address children's problems
but Mann noted that both presidential candidates had emphasized
children's issues in their campaigns.
   ``We need to hear more from each of them on a commitment of
dollars. We need to hear that they are willing to make the enormous
investment that the problems demand, and the children deserve,''
Mann added.

   Two whales trapped for nearly three weeks
in the arctic ice pack were freed Wednesday by Soviet and American
icebreakers, superpower saviors who hacked a path to the open sea.
   ``The whales are loose and in the channel and headed out,'' said
Lt. Mike Haller, a spokesman for the Alaska National Guard. ``They
looked good all afternoon. To look at them, you'd have thought they
had their bags packed and were ready to head south.''
   ``They're in the main lead, and I can't help but think they'll
keep on truckin'. I don't know how much more we can do,'' said
rescue coordinator Ron Morris of the U.S. National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration.
   The work to free the migrating California gray whales progressed
rapidly Tuesday when two Soviet ice-breaking vessels began smashing
the ice that kept the pair imprisoned. A third trapped whale is
believed to have died last week.
   Morris, who followed the whales by helicopter, landed a little
after 4 p.m. (9 p.m. EDT) to report that the whales had moved from
the final man-made breathing hole to the slushy path the Soviet
icebreaker Vladimir Arseniev cut Tuesday night.
   Rescue officials were worried that the whales would have trouble
breaking air holes through the partly frozen cut, but around 4:30
p.m. rescue workers found the two whales had opened a small
breathing hole and were sharing it.
   One of the whales was bleeding enough to stain the water red.
   Spectators watched anxiously for several moments, waiting for the
whales to surface in the new waterway cut Wednesday by the Arseniev
_ and cheered joyously when the whales broke the surface.
   As darkness fell, the whales were swimming back and forth in the
channel. Officials halted helicopter surveillance at nightfall, but
said they planned to meet Thursday and could check whether the
whales had reached the sea.
   The Arseniev stayed in the channel Wednesday night, widening the
passage to the open sea, officials said.
   Scientists and others involved in the rescue may never know the
whales' fate. ``A lot of people really didn't want to know,'' said
Jim Harvey, a federal marine biologist, after officials decided not
to put electronic tracking tags on the already stressed animals.
   Haller said plans were being made in Barrow to thank the Soviets
with a party, but Soviet officers said they would wait until it was
clear the whales were in the open sea before celebrating.
   Before the whales were freed, as the Soviet icebreakers drew
near, the whales were ``acting in a very excited manner, almost like
they can sense freedom,'' said Sgt. Ian Robertson, an Alaska
National Guard spokesman.
   By midday, the Soviet icebreakers were a quarter-mile from the
line of breathing holes being cut by Americans working in the
opposite direction, he said.
   Later Wednesday, rescuers began to use a gargantuan, tractor-like
device propelled by pontoon augers to clear the ice cut by the
icebreaker, Robertson said.
   The breakthrough in the effort to free the migrating gray whales
caught in an early freeze came after more than a week of delays and
disappointments.
   ``We feel very good about it,'' said Rear Adm. Sigmund Petersen
of NOAA. ``The cooperation has just been fantastic. The Soviets came
in here with a very positive attitude and went to work immediately.''
   On Tuesday, the Americans moved the huge mammals around a shoal
that had stymied progress for three days. Eskimos with chain saws
cut a detour in the ice so the whales could swim around the shallow
water they had refused to pass.
   When the Eskimos started cutting the air holes, the whales
``followed the water right to the end. They like that deeper
water,'' Petersen said.
   Working in the other direction, the Soviet icebreakers reduced to
rubble the ice ridge standing between the whales and open water. The
ridge, formed by colliding ice masses, was a jumble of ice blocks as
big as small houses.
   ``The whales seemed to be doing fine,'' Petersen said. ``It's
like they expected something to be happening. Everything seems to be
coming together.''
   The whales, which normally migrate to the Southern California
coast in the winter, were discovered off Alaska's northern coast
three weeks ago, the ice closing in around them and leaving them
only a few small breathing holes.
   The whales could not swim the four miles to open water without
surfacing for air. A third whale disappeared Friday and is believed
dead.
   The icebreakers _ the Admiral Makarov and the Arseniev _ began
working shortly after their arrival Tuesday, flying the flags of the
Soviet Union and the United States as a sign of cooperation between
the nations.
   The ships had been returning to their home port of Vladivostok
when they were diverted, said Alexander Patzevich, chief officer and
second in command.
   Although the Admiral Makarov has been at sea for six months and
``everybody is tired,'' none of the crew of 78 has complained about
the diversion, Patzevich said.
   ``It's very nice to work together,'' he said of the U.S.-Soviet
effort.
   First Mate Vladimir Moroz, who said he was the ship's political
officer, said the Soviets were happy to help. He said he spoke to a
Moscow newspaper by telephone.
   ``They're receiving many, many calls asking about the whales,''
he said. ``Our country is watching like everyone else. We love
animals, just as everyone.''
   The population of endangered California gray whales has risen to
about 20,000, growing at an annual average of 2.5 percent for the
past decade, officials said.
   The whales have one of the longest migration routes of all the
mammals, some 6,000 to 8,000 miles from the Arctic to the warm water
off Baja California.
   ``The human persistence and determination by so many individuals
on behalf of these whales shows mankind's concern for the
environment,'' President Reagan said from the White House. ``It has
been an inspiring endeavor.''

   A 4-year-old girl has died four days after
the surgery that left her in a coma and also apparently led to the
Mafia-style murder of her surgeon, Italian media reported.
   Caterina Giampaolo, who died Tuesday, was the daughter of Antonio
Giampaolo, a reputed local Mafia boss and fugitive who was sentenced
to 27 years in prison in 1986 for kidnapping.
   The dead girl's uncle, Vincenzo Giorgi, 25, is being held for
questioning by police in connection with the murder of her surgeon.
   Locri Hospital proclaimed a ``day of silence'' Tuesday to protest
the killing of Dr. Gino Marino, who operated on the girl Friday.
   Marino died early Sunday of gunshot wounds to the head. His
killers ambushed his car Saturday night, shooting out a tire to stop
it and then shooting Marino, police said.
   Various operating wards at hospitals throughout the southern
region of Calabria also closed Tuesday to protest the lack of police
protection for doctors, according to news reports.

   Two national polls have found George Bush
consolidating his lead in the presidential race, with fewer voters
saying they may change their minds _ although many remain
dissatisfied with their choices.
   Bush held double-digit leads in the CBS News-New York Times and
Gallup polls released Tuesday, further evidence of a surge for the
Republican nominee since his debate with Democrat Michael Dukakis on
Oct. 13.
   Bush led Dukakis by 13 points among probable voters in the
CBS-Times poll, 54-41 percent, and by 50-40 among registered voters
in Gallup's poll. He led by 14 points among Gallup respondents
judged likely to vote.
   Bush had led by a consistent but narrow margin _ four to seven
points in most polls _ since late August. But the numbers started to
move in his favor last week, and the new results continued that
trend.
   In one key finding, the CBS-Times poll found clear success in
Bush's attacks on Dukakis on crime. Sixty-two percent said Bush was
tough enough in dealing with crime and criminals; just 37 percent
said the same of Dukakis.
   In another, 25 percent said the political commercials they had
seen helped them decide whom to support, and more than half of that
group went for Bush. Still, 62 percent said commercials had not
helped them decide.
   The polls found dissatisfaction with both nominees. In the
CBS-Times poll, 64 percent wished they had other choices than Bush
and Dukakis. And just 42 percent of Gallup's respondents had a
strong preference, compared with about 60 percent at this stage in
the 1984 election.
   The surveys nonetheless found voters more firm in their
decisions. In Gallup's, 28 percent said they were undecided or could
change their minds _ down from 37 percent before the debate. In the
CBS-Times poll, 74 percent said their minds were made up, compared
with 66 percent earlier.
   As in other polls, Bush received disproportionate support from
men. They favored him by 54 percent to 38 percent in the Gallup
poll, while women backed him by a far tighter 46 percent to 42
percent margin.
   The poll demonstrated that voter choices were based on the top of
the ticket: The Democrats trailed even though Dukakis' running mate,
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, was rated far more favorably than was
Bush's, Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana. Bentsen was viewed favorably by
59 percent, unfavorably by 27 percent; for Quayle it was 42-44.
   Fifty-nine percent in the Gallup poll said they had a favorable
opinion of Bush, to 35 percent unfavorable. Dukakis did less well _
50 percent favorable, 43 percent unfavorable. The small remainders
didn't answer.
   The leads in the two polls were less than the Bush advantage in
the first full-sized survey conducted after the Oct. 13 debate, an
NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll that found him ahead by 17 points.
   No other poll has found a Bush lead that great. It was followed
by ABC News-Washington Post and Harris polls that found sizable but
smaller Bush leads _ seven and nine points respectively. Last
weekend a Newsweek poll, done by Gallup, put the Bush advantage at
nine points, 50-41.
   The new Gallup poll released Tuesday was conducted Friday through
Sunday among 1,232 registered voters and had margin of sampling
error of plus or minus three points. Of the total, 815 were
considered to be likely voters; the result among that group had a
four-point error margin.
   The CBS-Times poll was conducted Friday through Monday among
1,287 probable voters and had a three-point error margin.
   Meanwhile, Bush took a slight lead over Dukakis in a statewide
poll in Rhode Island, which was long thought to be safe territory
for the Democrat from nearby Massachusetts.
   The poll, conducted by Joseph Fleming & Associates for WPRI-TV,
found Bush with 46 percent support, Dukakis with 41 percent and 13
percent not sure.
   The survey of 414 registered voters was conducted last week and
had a nearly five-point margin of error, meaning the Bush lead is
just large enough to be statistically significant.
   In the Democratic stronghold of Maryland, Bush led Dukakis 51
percent to 42 percent, The Washington Post reported in today's
editions. The Post survey of 601 likely voters was conducted Tuesday
through Saturday and had a margin of error of four percentage points.

   When presidential campaigns enter their closing
days, it's a good bet the candidate denouncing the negative tactics
of his opponent is running behind.
   The first candidate to demand the opposition stop lying about his
record is probably in trouble.
   The Democrat who turns to populism is trying to turn the tide.
   The Republican who warns against big spending is trying to do the
same.
   That is the pattern of campaigns past and present. Sometimes it
works.
   Echoes of those closing arguments are being heard as the 1988
presidential campaign winds down.
   ``Full of lies and he knows it,'' says a new Michael Dukakis ad
denouncing the negative campaign tactics of George Bush. The
television spot closes with this dose of populism:
   ``The real question is will we have a president who fights for
the privileged few, or will we have a president who fights for you.''
   The Dukakis commercial was not the first time a candidate who
felt he was losing to Bush accused the vice president of distorting
his record.
   One of the more memorable moments of the campaign for the
Republican presidential nomination was the night of the New
Hampshire primary. Bob Dole, whose dream of winning the nomination
had been shaken by Bush's New Hampshire victory, was asked if there
was anything he wanted to say to the vice president.
   Dole glared at the camera and snapped, ``Yeah, tell him to stop
lying about my record.''
   It was all downhill from there for the Kansan who thought he
could have won in New Hampshire if the oppposition hadn't portrayed
him as soft on tax increases.
   But the Bush attacks probably harmed Dole less in the long run
than his demand that they stop. The senator's demeanor during that
televised instant resurrected memories of his ill-fated run as the
GOP vice presidential nominee in 1976, a race he later would admit
did not serve him well.
   Harry Truman wrote the book on how to upset a favored Republican
opponent with a strong dose of populist rhetoric.
   ``I'm going to fight hard,'' Truman recalled telling his running
mate, Kentucky Sen. Alben Barkley. ``I'm going to give them hell.''
   Truman set the tone at his opening rally on Labor Day.
   ``If in this next election you get a Congress and an
administration friendly to labor you have much to hope for,'' he
told a rally made up largely of union members. ``If you get a
Congress and an administration unfriendly to labor you have much to
fear.''
   Hubert H. Humphrey tried the same sort of populist appeal in the
closing weeks of the 1968 presidential campaign against Richard M.
Nixon. The Minnesotan succeeded in bringing many Democrats back to
the fold and the election turned out much closer than anybody had
predicted. But Humphrey fell 510,000 votes short of overtaking Nixon.
   Or this:
   ``He has campaigned with negativism, failing the American people
by refusing to lay out for them worthwhile programs in major fields
which for two months I have been discussing in frankness and
detail.''
   That appeal sounds a little like the theme Dukakis now is
sounding. But it was used by Nixon in 1960 and directed at John F.
Kennedy.
   Nixon said Kennedy ``advocates a Niagara of spending which would
in the end either raise their taxes or prices and would cheapen
their insurance policies, pensions and Social Security.''
   ``I've got news for those Republicans, we're going to be the ones
celebrating on election night,'' is a favorite Dukakis campaign line.
   ``The pollsters and the Republicans are in for the biggest
surprise of their lives,'' said Walter F. Mondale, the day before he
lost 49 states.
   In the closing days of the 1976 campaign, President Gerald R.
Ford said, ``I think we are neck and neck and when you have momentum
and the opposition is trying to put its finger in every dike to try
and stop the erosion, obviously we have the momentum going and they
are frantic, frustrated and frenzied.
   ``And, gee, I just feel good about it, just wonderful.''
   Ford did have momentum at that stage of the campaign, but not
enough to overtake Democrat Jimmy Carter.

<HEAD>Incumbents Enjoy Advantage Over Challengers in Fund-Raising, Study
Says</HEAD>

   Incumbents in the nation's Senate races have
rolled to a 3-to-1 advantage over challengers in fund raising this
year, underlining the need for campaign finance reform, says the
lobbying group Common Cause.
   Senators seeking re-election collected $102 million to finance
their campaigns as of Sept. 30, compared with just $38 million for
challengers, according to the group's analysis of reports submitted
to the Federal Election Commission.
   The analysis showed that one of four dollars flowing to
contenders in the nation's 33 Senate races comes from
special-interest groups, and incumbents enjoyed a 5-to-1 edge in
receipts from the political action committees, or PACs.
   ``Special-interst PACs are money machines for incumbents,'' said
Common Cause president Fred Wertheimer in a statement. ``The
congressional campaign finance system is patently unfair to
challengers.''
   The self-styled citizens lobby has been waging an uphill fight
for years to restrict PAC giving to campaigns and to impose overall
spending limits to give incumbents less of a lock on a House or
Senate seat. Campaign finance reform is expected to be near the top
of the list of legislative priorities when the 101st Congress
convenes in January.
   Senate candidates had raised $161.7 million by Sept. 30,
according to the analysis. Nearly $39 million of that came from PACs.
   Their financial edge enabled incumbents to spend $2 for every
dollar spent by challenges, on average, and still go into the final
month of the campaign with a huge cash advantage. Cash on hand for
the 27 incumbents totaled $33.3 million as of Sept. 30, compared
with just $7.3 million for their opponents.
   On average, incumbents raised $3.7 million each while challengers
averaged $1.4 million each, the study found.
   In the six races where there is no incumbent seeking re-election
_ Florida, Wisconsin, Mississippi, Washington, Virginia and Vermont
_ contenders have raised a total of $21.4 million, $4.7 million of
it from PACs, a slightly greater proportion than in the other
contests.
   The top fund-raiser overall, according to the study, is incumbent
Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif. Wilson had collected $12.5 million toward
his re-election bid, and also topped the spending list with $9.8
million in expenditures. California is one of the most expensive
media states in which to mount a campaign.
   Wilson's opponent, Democratic Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy, had raised
$5.4 million and spent $3.4 million on his challenge.
   The largest recipient of PAC money was Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, who is
waging dual campaigns for re-election to his Texas Senate seat and
as Democratic vice presidential candidate. Bentsen, also chairman of
the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, pulled in $2.3 million
from special-interest groups. Wilson ranked second on that list,
with $2 million.

   The operator of the contaminated Three Mile
Island nuclear plant hopes to mothball the reactor next year, but a
panel of citizens and scientists says more commitments to clean up
the site are needed first.
   A spokesman for the Pennsylvania plant's operator said Tuesday
that managers hoped to go ahead with the plan to place the crippled
Unit 2 reactor into ``monitored storage'' by the end of 1989.
   Next year will mark the 10th anniversary of the nation's worst
commercial nuclear accident at Three Mile Island on March 31, 1979.
   The storage plan calls for the reactor building to be locked up
and unneeded systems deactivated. The plant would sit for perhaps 30
years while radiation decays inside.
   Although the damaged nuclear fuel and loose radioactive
components would have been removed from the plant, radiation would
remain in piping and other areas of the reactor building basement.
   The Advisory Panel for the Decontamination of Unit 2 told the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission during a meeting Tuesday that nine of
its 11 members had sided against the so-called ``Post Defueling
Monitored Storage plan,'' which is known as PDMS.
   Arthur E. Morris, the panel chairman and the mayor of Lancaster,
Pa., said many in the group felt the plan was too vague. He said the
panel believed the cleanup ``should proceed expeditiously.''
   With no specific funding in place, Morris said there were
concerns that the cleanup of the plant might not be completed, even
after the storage phase ended. In addition, he said area residents
were troubled by the uncertainty of not knowing exactly how many
years the reactor would sit idle until it was decommissioned.
   ``The utility seems to have looked at this PDMS as a given, and
sort of expected us to go along with it,'' said panel member Joel
Roth.
   In the 1979 accident, Unit 2 was allowed to lose vital cooling
water that normally covers it. The subsequent $1 billion cleanup has
focused on water decontamination, waste shipment and removal of fuel
from the damaged core.
   Doug Bedell, a spokesman for GPU Nuclear, the plant operator,
said in an interview after Tuesday's meeting that the cleanup would
likely stop at the end of next year. He said it was pointless to
expose cleanup workers to additional risk after that because
remaining radiation would be ``fixed in place,'' presenting no
threat to the public.
   He said the utility envisioned letting Unit 2 sit idle until
after its twin, Unit 1, ended its service life in about the year
2010. Then, both units would be dismantled together.
   GPU Nuclear would need an amendment to its Nuclear Regulatory
Commission license before it could proceed with its storage plan.
The decision on whether to grant the change would be made by the NRC
staff, although it is possible the commissioners themselves would
get involved.

   President Reagan has banned most Nicaraguan
government officials from entering the United States in the latest
round of a tit-for-tat diplomatic feud.
   Under a proclamation released Tuesday by the White House, Reagan
declared ``the unrestricted ... entry of officers and employees of
the Nicaraguan government and the Sandinista National Liberation
Front ... to be detrimental to the interests of the United States.''
   The prohibition applies to all Nicaraguan government and party
officials with the exception of those carrying out activities
related to the United Nations or other international organizations.
Family members of such officials are exempted as well.
   The diplomatic tussle began on July 11, when Managua expelled
U.S. Ambassador Richard Melton and seven other American officials on
grounds they interfered in Nicaragua's internal affairs.
   The United States retaliated the next day by expelling Nicaraguan
Ambassador Carlos Tunnermann and seven of his colleagues.
   Since then, the Sandinista government has not acted on U.S.
attempts to replace the expelled U.S. envoys.
   ``We've been trying to get our people replaced, and we haven't
gotten anywhere,'' White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said.
   A call placed to the Nicaraguan Embassy seeking comment was not
returned.
   The president's action also comes in light of a new restriction
placed on U.S. officials in Nicaragua last month.
   On Sept. 22, the Sandinista government imposed the new
requirement that American diplomats based in Nicaragua who leave the
country, for whatever reason, must wait at least three weeks before
they may return.
   The dispute was aggravated last month when the Reagan
administration refused to allow Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega
to bring a delegation of 60 Nicaraguans on a proposed visit to the
United Nations and to Washington.
   The State Department said the Nicaraguans applied too late for
their visas, a claim the Sandinistas denied. Ortega canceled the
trip.

<HEAD>Builders Say No Insulation Changes Needed to Combat Radon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Association of Home Builders says
it won't recommend any changes in insulation practices to combat the
buildup of radon, which government officials say is probably the
second-ranking cause of lung cancer.
   At a news conference Tuesday, an official with the association
said it is telling its members to continue employing ``the same
practices we have recommended for years for energy conservation.''
   John Spears, program manager at the association's national
research center, said, ``We've found that energy conservation has
little to do with radon concentration in the house.''
   Spears' conclusion ``tracks with our preliminary results over the
past few years for both new homes and existing homes,'' said
Environmental Protection Agency spokesman Chris Rice. EPA is engaged
in a cooperative research program with the center.
   But EPA says increased ventilation still may be useful in
reducing radon buildup in particular homes.
   Last month EPA and the Public Health Service advised that
everyone living on a second floor or below should have indoor air
tested for radon. The Public Health Service issued a ``health
advisory,'' elevating indoor radon to the same status as smoking as
a health threat.
   EPA believes radon ranks second only to smoking as a cause of
lung cancer. Of the 130,000 annual deaths from lung cancer, about 85
percent are caused by smoking. EPA estimates radon could cause as
many as 20,000 deaths, which if true would be roughly all those not
caused by smoking.
   Radon is a radioactive gas emitted in some degree by all soils.
It quickly decays into other substances, but its decay products are
also radioactive and can lodge in the lung, irradiating the tissue
for a lifetime. Indoor dust and smoke, and smoke from tobacco
products, can carry these decay products into the lung.
   There are many techniques for reducing radon buildup, often the
same techniques that are used to keep water out of basements such as
careful sealing of joints, use of tight covers on sumps and a thick
polyethylene barrier between the slab and the ground.
   William H. Ethier, litigation counsel for the association, said
members were being advised that ``if they make a reasoned judgment
that there may be high radon levels,'' they should ``rough in''
mitigation techniques such as under-slab ventilation pipes that may
be ignored later if appropriate, or connected to a fan to divert
radon-laden air around the basement.
   In states such as Pennsylvania and New Jersey with
well-publicized instances of radon buildup, Ethier said he has found
``universal'' adoption of such precautions by builders.
   Builders report that the techniques may add as little as $100 to
the cost of a home, if water barriers are already being used, but as
much as $600 if they are not, he said.

<HEAD>New Cancer Drug Released, 87 New Cardiovascular Drugs Studied</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New drugs in the medical war against cancer and
cardiovascular disease are now available or on the way.
   The Food and Drug Administration announced Tuesday that a new
drug to treat the crippling effects of intestinal cancer can now be
marketed in the United States.
   In addition, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association said 47
companies are now working on a total of 87 new drugs to treat the
cardiovascular diseases of high blood pressure, stroke and heart
disease.
   The new cancer drug is a protein compound called octreotide
acetate that is designed to stop the severe, unrelenting diarrhea
that often takes the lives of patients suffering from intestinal
cancer.
   FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young said the new drug ``can
dramatically improve life for these cancer patients, permitting many
to pursue their normal lives for years, rather than be weakened and
continually hospitalized.''
   The new drug, marketed by Sandoz Pharmaceuticals under the brand
name Sandostatin, does not actually attack the cancer itself.
Instead, it blocks production of a peptide that causes the diarrhea.
   Young said patients with malignant carcinoid tumors and
vasoactive intestinal peptide-secreting tumors often can live 15 to
20 years before dying as a direct result of the slow-growing cancer.
But because the cancer forces the secretion of peptides that cause
the severe diarrhea, patients usually die sooner.
   Sandostatin prevents the diarrhea by blocking the secretion of
the peptides. The drug does this by imitating the action of
somatostatin, a natural hormone that regulates secretions from the
body's organs. The drug is administered by injection.
   The FDA said the cancer is diagnosed in one to two people per
million annually.
   Gerald J. Mossinghoff, president of the Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers Association, said a survey of the association members
indicates there are 87 new drugs for cardiovascular disease
treatment now in clinical trials or awaiting final FDA approval.
   ``No other disease is targeted by so many drugs in development or
so much investment in research,'' said Mossinghoff.
   He acknowledged at a news conference that one of the reasons the
companies are pouring so much investment into cardiovascular
diseases is that there remains a huge market for such therapies even
though doctors now realize they are among the most preventable
illnesses for people who adopt healthy lifestyles in their early and
middle years.
   Dr. John F. Beary III, senior vice president for science and
technology for the trade association, noted that heart disease
remains the nation's No. 1 killer and stroke No. 3.
   Even though the population is generally healthier, as well as
older, than in years past, Beary said, ``at some point these
diseases catch up with everyone.''
   The pharmaceutical trade group's survey of its more than 100
members was designed to provide an overview of the scope of new drug
development in various categories, rather than highlight any
particularly promising ``breakthrough'' drugs.
   The trade association plans similar surveys in December for
cancer drugs under development and in January for arthritis,
Alzheimer's and other diseases of the aging.
   The cardiovascular disease survey found more medicines being
developed for hypertension, or high blood pressure, than any other
condition with all but three of the 38 drugs in that category in the
final stages of testing.
   The pharmaceutical association said the second largest category,
with 28 drugs under development, is congestive heart failure.

<HEAD>Investigators Blame Pilot For AVAir Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A commuter airliner crash last February that
killed all 12 people on board was caused mainly by an excessively
rapid turn after the aircraft took off from Raleigh-Durham, N.C.,
airport, federal investigators say.
   The National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday blamed pilot
error for the AVAir crash, but it said contributing factors were the
commuter line's failure to act when it received information the
pilot had previous flying problems and the government's inadequate
monitoring of the airline, which had financial problems.
   The AVAir plane, flying as American Eagle Flight 378, crashed
shortly after it took off in dense fog on Feb. 19, l988, landing in
wooded area about a mile from the airport runway.
   The Fairchild Metro III commuter was bound for Richmond, Va.,
with 10 passengers, a pilot and a copilot.
   The NTSB criticized the Federal Aviation Administration for not
keeping a closer watch on AVAir's financial problems during a period
of rapid expansion and not forwarding such information to the
inspectors assigned to the airline.
   AVAir had undergone rapid growth in 1987 as a feeder for American
Airlines at Raleigh-Durham. It was ranked the 30th largest commuter
airline in the country last year carrying 351,522 passengers but met
hard times in late l987. It filed for bankruptcy last January,
resumed operation in February but sold its commuter operation to
American Airlines in May.
   The NTSB said the probable cause for the Feb. 19 accident was
``the failure of the flight crew to maintain a proper flight path
due to the first officer's inappropriate instrument scan, the
captain's inadequate monitoring of the flight and the flight crew's
response to a fault in the airplane's stall avoidance system.''
   The investigation revealed that the copilot, Kathleen Digan, 28,
who had been hired by AVAir in May 1987, had a spotty flying record
and on a number of occasions had been the subject of critical
evaluations by various AVAir captains.
   In July 1987 an AVAir captain wrote the airline's operations
chief on hotel stationery that Ms. Digan had trouble on eight of 10
landings she flew during their trip together and that he considered
her performance ``unacceptable.'' Two months later another AVAir
captain reported in an evaluation that Ms. Digan had problems in
clmb, cruise, descent and landing maneuvers.
   According to the NTSB, she was hired by AVAir, on March 5, 1987,
when the airline needed scores of new pilots because of expansion
plans. Ms. Digan was one of 123 pilots hired by AVAir in the second
quarter of l987, according to the safety board.
   Ms. Digan had 2,080 hours of flying including a total of 450
hours on a Fairchild Metro II and Metro III at the time of the
accident.
   Investigators determined that Ms. Digan was at the controls when
the Metro III commuter plane departed Raleigh-Durham on Feb. 19,
although there was evidence that the captain, Walter Cole, 38,
attempted to help keep the aircraft aloft in the final seconds.
   The flight was the first she had flown in instrument conditions
in 4{ weeks, the report said.
   Flight 378 had been told by air traffic control to bank to the
right as soon as possible after takeoff because of the heavy traffic
loads at the time of the departure, investigators said.
   But Ms. Digan, flying in foggy conditions, banked the aircraft at
only 200 feet and at a 40 degree angle, almost twice as sharp as
would have been prudent, and likely became somewhat disoriented,
allowing the plane to descend, the safety board said.
   The pilots were relying on instruments because of the poor
visibility and the NTSB concluded that if the pilots had scanned
their instruments adequately they would have known the bank was too
sharp and at too low an altitude.
   The NTSB report said the pilots also might have been distracted
by a light indicating that the aircraft's stall warning system had
activated. The system automatically forces the nose down if the
aircraft is approaching a stall.
   According to the investigation, the aircraft's performance
indicated that the stall warning system actually had not deployed,
and the problem stemmed from a false warning light.

<HEAD>Senators Already Trying to Protect Home-District Bases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ink was barely dry on the military
base-closing law signed by President Reagan this week when 17
senators began trying to make sure their home-district bases are
spared at the expense of others.
   The senators, from Northeastern and Midwestern states, claimed
that the Sunbelt region has a disproportionate share of military
installations and therefore should suffer the most cuts.
   The senators said in a letter Tuesday that a Pentagon-appointed
commission should consider ``regional inequities'' as it decides
which bases to close.
   Reagan had signed the base-closing bill just one day earlier. It
authorizes the Defense Department to close unneeded military bases
to achieve savings of up to $5 billion per year.
   A 12-member commission is authorized to make the decisions and
report on is conclusions by Dec. 31. Congress may veto the entire
list but cannot act to protect individual bases, as it often has in
the past.
   ``We wish to prevent the further entrenchment of regional
inequities stemming from the location of existing military
facilities,'' said the letter from members of the Northeast-Midwest
Senate Coalition.
   The letter was addressed to Abraham Ribicoff, a former senator
from Connecticut who co-chairs the Defense Secretary's Commission on
Base Realignment and Closure.
   Jim Abbee, spokesman for the base closing commission, laughed and
said, ``So what's new?'' when told about the senators' letter. Abbee
said he would not comment further until he had seen a copy.
   The senators said in their letter that Sunbelt states already
enjoy an advantage in numbers of bases.
   The letter pointed to a report by congressional conferees on the
base-closing bill that said geography should ``be carefully weighed
during the commission's deliberations leading to its closure and
realignment recommendations.''
   However, that provision was dropped before the legislation was
given final approval.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci will have until Jan. 15 to
accept or reject the list of recommended base closings.
   Signing the letter were the two senators each from Pennsylvania,
New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Maine, Michigan and Massachusetts,
and Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., and Richard
Lugar, R-Ind.

<HEAD>Government To Send `Dear Farmer Jones' Letters To Late Borrowers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 90,000 farmers who are behind in their
loan repayments to the Farmers Home Administration will be getting
notices shortly after the Nov. 8 election telling them to start
making arrangements for settlement.
   The Agriculture Department agency said Tuesday the notices will
be an attempt to collect about $8.8 billion in past-due loans.
   Spokesman Marlyn Aycock said rules implementing new credit
legislation will take effect Nov. 14 and that ``Dear Farmer Jones''
notices will start going out soon thereafter to the delinquent FmHA
borrowers.
   Aycock said the notices will say: ``This is to inform you that
you're seriously behind in your loan payments and to inform you of
your options. Farmers who are more than 180 days late in making
payments have several options.''
   The notices will explain that the FmHA borrowers must notify the
agency within 45 days if they intend to apply to make arrangements
for settling their debts. Details regarding the options, including
debt restructuring and write-offs, also will be provided.
   Aycock said the timetable for sending out the notices as promptly
as possible took into consideration the months of rulemaking,
periods for public comment and time for training FmHA people to
handle the additional job load.
   Congress ordered FmHA to revise its lending practices in the
Agricultural Credit Act of 1987. The agency is often called the farm
lender of last resort because it makes loans only to those who
cannot qualify at banks or other commercial sources.
   The debt write-down, or forgiveness provision, is regarded as one
of the most important parts of the 1987 law. It allows FmHA to
reduce a farmer's delinquent debt to the recovery value of the
collateral, which is usually land or farm equipment, depending on
cash flow and other factors.
   Also, as the result of lawsuits, the FmHA is under court order to
redo many of its loan regulations and to hold up on foreclosures and
forced liquidations until those actions are completed.
   Estimates of the extent of FmHA loan delinquencies and numbers of
farmers potentially threatened by foreclosure under the new rules
have varied.
   Last May 23, when the new regulations were proposed, FmHA losses
resulting from write-offs and other settlements were estimated at
about $8.7 billion and that about 118,000 borrowers were delinquent.
About 64,800 of those could be pushed into liquidation or
foreclosure because they couldn't qualify for help under the new law.
   Another major step was an interim rule announced on Sept. 14,
including procedures for making debt restructuring and write-downs.
Those were to take effect on Oct. 14 on an interim basis and called
for final adoption on Nov. 14 after a 60-day period for public
comments.
   In the September announcement, the earlier analysis was used
again which referred to 118,000 delinquent borrowers, including
about 65,000 who would be rejected for debt write-downs. The
potential losses were said to be as high as $9.4 billion, although
about $1 billion could be salvaged by the agency.
   Aycock said the current estimate of 90,000 delinquent borrowers
was based on figures last fall, when FmHA delinquencies are
historically lower than those in January, when the 118,000 were
reported.

   Agriculture Department scientists say that tiny
beneficial worms, or nematodes, can be produced in a laboratory,
dried out for storage and revived later to fight destructive pests
in back yards.
   ``They're still living and breathing but they're dormant,'' says
entomologist James E. Lindegran of the department's Agricultural
Research Service laboratory, Fresno, Calif.
   Lindegran and researchers at a California biotechnology firm,
Biosys, found that the microscopic nematodes such as Steinernema
feltiae can be dried, stored as a ``paste'' under refrigeration and
then revived with water.
   ``When you add water, the worms plump back up again,'' Lindegran
said in a report issued here by the USDA agency. ``When they start
moving around, they're ready to be sprayed onto plants, trees or
soil.''
   The beneficial nematodes attack pests that are in the larvaal or
wormlike stage of development by entering through openings such as
the mouth or breathing tubes, he said.
   ``Once inside a pest, the nematodes excrete a unique bacterium
that kills the pest, is food for the nematodes and produces
antibiotics that keep other bacteria at bay,'' Lindegran said.
   The nematodes are harmless to humans but lethal to a variety of
pests, including carpenterworms, cutworms, armyworms, fruit flies
and root maggots.

   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Exports of farm crops in the fiscal year that
ended on Sept. 30 required the production from about 107 million
harvested acres, according to the Agriculture Department.
   That represented 36 percent of the 301 million acres of crops
harvested in the 1987-88 year, the department's Economic Research
Service said in a new outlook report on the nation's agricultural
resources.
   Although the 1987-88 export acreage was up 11 percent from the
previous year, it was far below the record high of 137 million acres
in 1980, the report said.
   Of the 107 million acres needed to grow crops for export last
year, food grains _ mainly wheat and rice _ led with 40 million
acres, followed by oilseeds (mostly soybeans), 30 million; feed
grains (mostly corn), 21 million; cotton, 11 million; and other
crops, 11 million.

<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration is preparing to
support a loan request by Chile in the Inter-American Development
Bank, indicating a policy shift that State Department officials say
reflects improved human rights performance in that country.
   The bank was expected to take up Chile's request for a $35
million loan for rural road repair today.
   The administration has invariably abstained on such requests in
recent years as evidence of its displeasure toward the policies of
the country's military government.
   According to the officials, Chile's human rights record has
improved substantially in recent months, with the lifting of a
15-year old state of emergency in August and a national plebiscite
held three weeks ago.
   Chilean voters denied President Augusto Pinochet an additional
eight-year term and open elections are scheduled for next year.
   Until recently, the administration had frequently criticized
Chile on grounds that it was one of only a handful of hemispheric
countries that had not moved toward democratic rule.
   The only exception to the administration's policy of abstaining
on Chilean loan requests involved projects that offered direct
benefits to the poor. The pending request before the IADB does not
fall into that category.
   The State Department officials, insisting on anonymity, said the
U.S. decision to support the road repair loan does not mean Chile
can count on U.S. backing for future loan requests.
   Those votes will be based on Chile's future human rights record
and on the viability of the project for which financing is sought.
   Abstentions cast by American delegates to the IADB and other
international financial institutions on Chilean requests usually
were symbolic because Chile was able to count on enough support from
other bank members to ensure approval of its applications.
   The United States is the principal contributor to the IADB, which
was set up 30 years ago to promote development in Latin America.
   The administration policy to abstain on most Chilean requests
generally was supported by Congress, which enacted a statute a
decade ago barring the executive branch from assisting countries
engaging in ``gross and consistent'' human rights violations.
   Chile was never placed in that category but the administration
decided to show disapproval over the situation in Chile through the
abstention policy.
   There are a number of other impediments to the restoration of
normal relations between the United States and Chile. For more than
a decade, Congress has barred military aid and training to Chile as
well as bilateral economic aid.
   The officials said no decision on lifting any of these sanctions
is expected this year.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Accuse North Of Commiting `Classic Fraud'</HEAD>

   Oliver L. North and his co-defendants
perpetrated ``a classic fraud on government'' when they diverted
profits from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to help arm the Nicaraguan
rebels, prosecutors said.
   Responding to North's contention that he did not defraud the
government, prosecutors said the four Iran-Contra defendants created
a ``secret slush fund'' for activities ``outside the normal channels
of governmental accountability.''
   By overcharging Iran for weapons in the arms-for-hostage
transactions, North and the others undermined President Reagan's
initiative to free Americans held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian groups,
independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh said in pleadings filed
Tuesday.
   North and former national security adviser John M. Poindexter
``chose to advance their private, unauthorized ends at the cost of
putting at hazard the ends they were supposed to be pursuing,
including that of saving the lives of the Americans held hostage in
Lebanon.''
   North, Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim and retired Air
Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord are charged with conspiring to
defraud the government and theft by diverting more than $14 million
in arms-sale profits to a criminal ``enterprise'' that secretly
financed the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   North's lawyers contended in pleadings filed Oct. 11 that there
was no fraud or theft because the government didn't own the weapons
after they were sold to Secord and Hakim, who acted as middlemen in
the transactions.
   But Walsh said the alleged scheme ``constitutes a classic fraud
on the government.''
   ``The thrust of the fraud is the breach of the public trust:
Poindexter's and North's discharge of their official duties (e.g.,
execution of the Iran initiative) was driven by a concealed and
wholly improper motive _ a desire to generate a slush fund for use
in financing unauthorized activities designated by them.''
   Prosecutors said North, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel,
``exploited his position to exact from Iranians a high selling
price, while concealing from the government the nature of the price
spread and his control over the excess profits.''
   ``The goals of establishing improved relations with Iran and
potentially securing the release of American hostages held by groups
sympathetic to that country were undermined and put seriously at
risk by the conspirators' private motive to charge prices well in
excess of what otherwise might have been charged in order to secure
additional profits,'' the prosecution said.
   ``Defendants Secord and Hakim agreed to hold funds generated by
North and to apply them to purposes selected by North and Poindexter
outside the normal challenges of governmental accountability,''
prosecutors said.
   Secord and Hakim ``reaped lucrative profits from the money North
steered to them'' as middlemen in the transactions, prosecutors said.
   Prosecutors said they were not required to show that the
defendants' activities undermined Reagan's effort to free the
hostages. ``It is enough that it was reasonably foreseeable that
they would have that effect, as it clearly was.''
   No date has been set for the trial of North, the first of four
trials ordered by U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell.

   Castleberry's Food Co. said Tuesday it is
recalling 2,161 cases of canned corned beef hash because part of one
day's production was improperly cooked.
   Only 35 cases actually are believed to be involved, but the
company is recalling the entire day's production of the product from
Sept. 21 ``to be on the safe side,'' said Dick Lamb, director of
personnel.
   The corned beef hash is packaged in 7.5 ounce single serving cans
with pull-tops. The product is sold primarily in vending machines,
but some is sold through convenience and grocery stores.
   Castleberry's described as possibly non-sterile the product in
cans under the code numbers 2J81CBV4 and 2J81CBV3. The food was
distributed in Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, New
Jersey and Michigan. Of the more than 2,000 cases involved in the
recall, 36 cases were distributed in Georgia.
   Consumers who have 7.5-ounce cans of the hash with either of the
codes on the bottom of the cans were asked to return the product to
the store where it was purchased for a refund.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Private exporters have sold China an additional
400,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices for shipment
in December, according to the Agriculture Department.
   The sales, equal to about 14.7 million bushels, were handled by
six companies: Cargill Inc., 50,000 tons; Continental Grain Co.,
110,000; Richco Grain Co., 40,000; Louis Dreyfus Corp., 120,000;
Bunge Corp., 40,000; and Mitsubishi International Corp., 40,000.
   Melvin E. Sims, general manager for the department's Foreign
Agricultural Service, said Tuesday the sales were part of 2 million
tons of wheat authorized on Aug. 18 under the Export Enhancement
Program.
   Although no selling prices or other details were announced,
recent prices of wheat at farm points have averaged around $3.84 per
bushel, indicating a U.S. farm value of about $56 million.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat.
   The program enables exporters to sell wheat and other designated
commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in order to
meet foreign competition. The exporters then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or subsidies.
   Sims said the bonuses due the six exporters for the latest deal
averaged $21.12 per ton of wheat, or about 58 cents per bushel.
   China has an additional 560,000 tons of U.S. wheat available
under the Export Enhancement Program, he said.

   Fredesvina Avila-Iscoa, 32, also had been charged with assault

Capt. Michael Palacio after an argument aboard the M-V Daniel J.
   He pleaded guilty Monday in U.S. District court to assault with
intent to commit bodily injury with a weapon and faces five to 20
years in prison and a fine up to $250,000.
   The original charges carried a maximum sentence of 35 years in
prison and $750,000 fine.
   Prosecutors said the argument broke out July 23, about 250 miles
offshore, when Avila was told not to eat fish the captain had caught.
   Avila shot Palacio in the leg with a 9 mm pistol after the
captain refused to feed him other provisions and threatened to
withhold his pay, according to witnesses.

   The massive rescue effort to save two California gray whales
won't make a difference to the survival of the species, but it's
been a public relations dream for environmentalists trying to rouse
the world to save its oceans.
   ``What's the big deal? I don't know. It all of a sudden
exploded,'' said Howard Braham, director of the National Marine
Mammal Laboratory in Seattle, the chief U.S. research center on
whales.
   ``Only the individual can answer if it's worth it,'' Braham said.
``We're dealing with the human spirit. We allow some awfully damning
things to go unchecked and then we reach out to something with a
tear in our eye.''
   The leviathan rescue has thrown together an unlikely army of
would-be saviors: whale-hunting Eskimos, Greenpeace
environmentalists, oil companies, the U.S. and Soviet governments,
wildlife experts, animal behavior specialists and chainsaw
mechanics. An international cast of some 40 to 60 reporters keeps
the world informed of any progress.
   The two surviving gray whales imprisoned by the ice are part of
an endangered species, meaning they are thought to be in imminent
danger of becoming extinct.
   But the population of grays is flourishing. There are about
21,000, which is near the historic peak of 25,000 reached before
whale hunters slaughtered all but a few thousand around the turn of
the century.
   The Soviets kill 169 gray whales each year to feed Eskimos under
an exemption granted by the International Whaling Commission, and
another 1,000 animals die of natural causes yearly, according to
government estimates.
   Despite the losses, the population of grays increases by 2.5
percent a year, and the deaths of three wayward whales not yet old
enough to breed would be insignificant, scientists said.
   ``There's no loss from a biological standpoint,'' said research
biologist David Withrow from the National Marine Mammal Laboratory.
   But cold facts have no chance against heated emotions when human
nature fights Mother Nature.
   The whales have names. Biologists call the two survivors Bonnet
and Crossbeak. The Inupiat Eskimos who discovered them Oct. 7 call
them Putu and Siku for Ice Hole and Ice. A third whale, Bone or
Kanik for Snowflake, apparently died Friday.
   Television brought the whales into U.S. homes. Nightly pictures
of their battered and bleeding snouts protruding from a breathing
hole cut like a harpoon into American hearts.
   ``These animals are turning out to be ambassadors for all marine
life,'' said Susan Vernon of the Whale Museum in Friday Harbor,
Wash. ``I don't think it's overreaction. It's a catharsis. The
helping hand was extended. And it was extended in good faith.''
   Gray whales feed in the icy Arctic Ocean, then migrate 7,000
miles to breed off balmy Baja California. The three trapped whales
were migrating for the first time.
   Even experienced bowhead whales, equipped with thick skulls to
break through ice, get hemmed in. About 10 to 12 of them perish each
year off northern Alaska, biologists said.
   Some have questioned the expense of trying to save the whales _
which had reached upward of $600,000 and counting as of Monday _
while funding for U.S. whale research has been cut. The annual
budget for the National Marine Mammal Laboratory is $2 million, down
from $2.8 million in 1985.
   ``However much money they're spending on the rescue is fine,''
said Patty Warhol, director of the American Cetacean Society in San
Pedro, Calif.
   ``That money might be better used in research, but you just can't
buy that kind of public relations for whales,'' she said. ``Today,
there are people all over the country talking about whales who two
weeks ago didn't know they existed or thought they were big fish.''
   The mercy mission has melted hearts of grizzled oil field
roustabouts from the bone-chilling North Slope, who also have reaped
a public relations harvest of good will for their labors.
   VECO Inc. of Prudhoe Bay offered to send a 185-ton ice
pulverizing hoverbarge to smash a pathway to the sea, with ARCO
Alaska Inc. donating fuel to the Alaska National Guard helicopter
that tried vainly to coax it to the whales. The barge got stuck in
shallow water.
   ``It was a common cause to help the underdog. We're human too,''
said Marvin King, operations manager for VECO. ``It's not money.
It's not headlines. We wanted to do what we could to help another
mammal.''
   ``We did what we should have done,'' said Ben Odom, senior vice
president of ARCO Alaska. ``It's a sad sight to see them struggling
to stay alive. What's that worth to help them? We're not discouraged
by the naysayers.''

   Terry Bradshaw says a 33-year-old softball
injury created more anxiety than the countless injuries he sustained
during his 14 years as a National Football League quarterback.
   Doctors discovered Monday that the old injury was to blame for
chest pains that have plagued the CBS-TV football commentator in
recent weeks. The diagnosis came amid a report by a Pittsburgh TV
station that the scar matter doctors found was a tumor.
   Bradshaw, 40, said Tuesday from his suburban Dallas home that he
was about 7 years old when he was hit by a softball, breaking his
sternum. He first noticed chest pains Oct. 11, prompting him to
undergo tests.
   ``Not knowing what's wrong is the thing that drives you crazy,''
Bradshaw said. ``I've worried myself sick these past few weeks.''
   Bradshaw led the Pittsburgh Steelers to an unprecedented four
Super Bowl championships during an NFL career that ended in 1983.

Moscow legally, a magazine reported.
   The weekly Goldenes Blatt said Tuesday that Rust, 20, had been

   ``I wanted to visit Red Square and see the city's sights with my

Rust said.
   Rust caused a major shakeup of the Soviet military leadership

   Rust was convicted of illegally entering the Soviet Union,
violating international flight rules and malicious hooliganism, and
sentenced to four years. He was released Aug. 4.

   Songwriter Sammy Cahn has won five

performing at an Atlantic City casino this weekend.
   ``When I get to Atlantic City, I'm going to laugh so loud at the

``High Hopes,'' and ``Call Me Irresponsible.''
   ``To see my name in a place where so many performers have come to
sing my songs. Do you know what a kick that will be?''
   Cahn's excitement also may be due to the fact that although he's
been in show business 60 years, he's only been performing for about

   ``I always wanted to be a performer, but when I started out,
vaudeville was phasing out,'' said Cahn.

   One made ``Bad.'' The other makes
``Ram'' pickup trucks. And Michael Jackson and Lee Iacocca had a
similarly brief exchange of words when the pop superstar met the
Chrysler Corp. chairman.
   Iacocca met Jackson backstage shortly before the singer performed
Monday night at the Palace of Auburn Hills. The meeting was set up
after one of Jackson's attorneys wrote to Iacocca.
   ``Michael had read Lee's book (`Talking Straight') and, you know,
Michael is mentioned in the book,'' Chrysler spokesman John Guiniven
said. ``There was a mutual interest in the meeting.''
   But Guiniven said he had no idea what the two said to each other.
   In ``Talking Straight,'' Iacocca defended the $20.5 million he
made in 1986 through salary and stock options, writing: ``$20
million sounds more like Michael Jackson's income for a weekend than
the annual pay of a guy who can't carry a tune in the shower.''
   Iacocca's estimate was off the mark if Monday night's show was
anywhere near Jackson's standard. Net income from the concert was
$125,000, an amount Jackson donated Sunday to the Motown Museum,
honoring the Motown Records label to which he and his brothers were
signed in 1969.

   Two Soviet ships arrived and one began
pounding through ice Tuesday in an effort to free two gray whales
trapped off the northern Alaska coast for nearly three weeks.
   The Admiral Makarov started breaking ice almost immediately after
the vessel arrived near Point Barrow. By evening, the ship had made
substantial progress and was expected to continue working through
the night, with its companion cargo vessel, the Vladimir Arseniev,
clearing away the shattered ice.
   The Soviet ships flew the flags of both the Soviet Union and the
United States in a symbol of international cooperation. The rescue
effort, called Operation Breakthrough, also has involved Eskimos
with chain saws and an unusual vehicle called an Archimedes screw
tractor acting in concert.
   ``It's very nice to work together to do something good between
two people,'' said Alexander Patzevich, chief officer of the Admiral
Makarov.
   U.S. Coast Guard Capt. Joseph McClelland Jr. called the effort
``terrific'' and was optimistic the whales would be freed.
   ``With the wind going the way it is, it couldn't be better,'' he
said.
   Biologists reported the whales were in good condition.
   They moved around a shoal through which they had refused to pass
earlier, and by Tuesday night they were about two miles from an open
lead, or pathway, through the ice and 2 miles beyond the site at
which they and another whale were found.
   Rescuers, meanwhile, received one bit of good news about the
jumbled mass of ice.
   They discovered that a pressure ridge apparently was not anchored
to the sea bottom as initially was feared. A pressure ridge is where
two opposing ice masses meet.
   ``It appears that most of the ridge has a current running through
it, making it easier for the icebreakers to work,'' said Ron Morris,
a biologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
   The California gray whales must get through the tangle if they
are to reach the nearest completely open water, 200 miles away in
the Chukchi Sea.
   Gary Hufford, with the National Weather Service, said he and
another ice expert were working on the pressure ridge Monday when
they had some unwelcome company _ a polar bear. A helicopter pilot
landed the aircraft between the whales and the bear, which caused
the animal to leave.
   ``It's something to remember. There are not only whales out
there,'' Hufford said.
   The whales were stranded about 100 yards offshore nearly three
weeks ago by shifting ice about 13 miles northeast of Barrow. A
third whale disappeared Friday and is presumed dead.
   Biologists reported a setback late Monday when the whales balked
near a shoal and retreated about a half-mile toward shore.
   Craig George, a biologist with the North Slope Borough, said the
whales overnight remained well back from a series of new breathing
holes that had been cut toward the ice ridge. They apparently were
spooked by the shallow water.
   There is about 12 feet of water over the 125-yard-wide shoal,
George said. The whales had been spending most of the time in water
17- to 25 feet deep.
   The turnaround came after rescuers switched tactics Monday. They
connected a series of breathing holes to form a single open channel
some 600 yards long. Eskimos used long poles to guide the miniature
icebergs toward the rear of the slot.
   Initially, the strategy worked. But when the channel behind them
was nearly filled, the whales reversed course, struggling up for air
by poking their way through the large slabs of ice and thick slush.
   That setback offset earlier excitement about the performance of
the Archimedes screw tractor, a 12-ton machine that smashes up to 18
inches of ice as it moves along on pontoons shaped like augers.
   It leaves a slushy path 14-feet wide in its wake. Technicians
were building a rake of sorts Tuesday, designed to follow along in
the channel behind the big auger. The rake is supposed to shunt the
slush down and under the adjacent ice, officials said.
   Biologists said they also were considering ``Plan C,'' a
last-ditch possibility that they may have to airlift the animals to
open water. Withrow said it was a last resort because the whales
could be injured.

   Wages in the past 12 months have risen an
average 3.9 percent, but private employer costs for benefits have
soared 6.7 percent _ more than double the previous year _ largely on
increases in Social Security taxes, the government said Tuesday.
   The combined effect of the pay raises and higher benefit costs
have sent total employer costs up 4.7 percent in the 12 months
ending Oct. 1, compared with a 3.4 percent rise in the previous
12-month period, the Labor Department said.
   Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, has risen by
4.2 percent over the past 12 months, the government reported last
week.
   The steep increase in benefit costs resulted primarily from a
rise last January in employers' Social Security tax rate from 7.15
percent to 7.51 percent, the Labor Department said.
   It also cited large increases in health insurance costs and
lump-sum bonus payments from profit-sharing arrangements, which are
now calculated by the government as a benefit rather than a wage. In
the 12 months ending October a year ago, benefits costs rose only
3.1 percent, but they went up 6.7 percent in 12 months ending Oct. 1.
   Non-union employees continued to get bigger percentage pay raises
than union members _ a trend begun in 1983 _ except for blue-collar
workers in manufacturing.
   The Bureau of Labor Statistics said wage rates among union
members rose an average 2.9 percent in the past 12 months, compared
with 3.9 percent for non-union workers. In the previous 12-month
period, union wages rose an average 1.7 percent, compared with 3.8
percent for non-union employees.
   ``This pattern reversed when limited to blue-collar workers in
manufacturing,'' the bureau said, with wage increases in the past
year averaging 3.2 percent for union members and 2.8 percent for
non-union workers.
   For the first time, the government also is comparing total
compensation increases between union and non-union workers to
account for the lump-sum arrangements.
   With those benefits included, employer costs rose the same 4.5
percent among union and non-union employees, the bureau said.
   John Zalusky, an economist for the AFL-CIO, called the statistics
``refreshing.''
   ``They're beginning to show in fact what is really going on out
there in the world,'' he said, ``but there still is a good way to
go.''
   For example, Zalusky cited the last round of steel industry
contracts in which the union conceded pay cuts to companies then
operating at losses in exchange for a share of future profits or
stock transfers if no profits occurred.
   ``The statistics are now picking up the profit distributions but
not the stock transfers for what essentially is a debt owed
workers,'' he said. ``In the future I expect them to start putting
in the value of stock ownership plans and in the distant future
retraining funds, such as those negotiated with the auto companies.''
   Despite the disparity in percentage wage increases in recent
years, unionized workers continue to make about 35 percent more than
non-union workers _ an average gap of $123 a week in 1987 compared
with a gap of $119 in 1986 _ according to government data.
   Among white-collar workers, wage increases have averaged 4.2
percent over the past 12 months, compared with 4 percent the
previous 12 months, the government said. Blue-collar wages have
increased a smaller 3.3 percent, respectively, over the same two
periods.
   The biggest pay gains, 5.6 percent, were among business and
health service workers, followed by an average increases of 4.9
percent for professional and technical employees.
   Managers and executives, along with state and local government
workers, have averaged the same 4.7 percent wage gains over the past
year. The average pay increase among private industry workers was
3.7 percent, for a combined average gain for all workers of 3.9
percent, the Labor Department said.
   By regions, the biggest pay increases over the past 12 months
have been in the Northeast, 4.6 percent, followed by the South at
3.8 percent. Average raises in the West and Midwest were 3.2 percent
and 2.9 percent, respectively.
   In a separate report Tuesday, the Labor Department said annual
pay rose an average 4.6 percent among the 101 million workers with
jobs in the nation's 317 metropolitan areas last year.
   Kenosha, Wis., with large pay increases in manufacturing and
construction, had the biggest average increase, up 10.6 percent _
from $18,666 in 1986 to $20,648 in 1987.
   The New Haven-Waterbury-Meriden area of Connecticut and the
Monmouth-Ocean City, N.J., metropolitan areas were next with average
annual pay increases of 8.4 percent last year.
   On the other end of the scale, workers in Flint, Mich., with a
large decline in employment and falling wages in manufacturing,
suffered an average pay loss of 4.2 percent _ from $26,633 in 1986
to $25,514 last year.
   Other cities in which average pay fell last year were Anchorage,
Alaska; Anderson, Ind.; Enid, Okla.; Lawrence, Kan.; Lansing, Mich.;
Midland, Texas; and Pine Bluff, Ark.
   Despite the decline, Anchorage continued to have the highest
average pay level in the country at $28,486. New York City was next
at $28,179, followed by the Bridgeport-Stamford-Nowalk-Danbury area
of Connecticut at $27,832 and San Jose, Calif., at $27,748.
   Jacksonville, N.C., again had the lowest average annual pay at
$13,246, followed by three Texas border areas:
McAllen-Edinburg-Mission at $13,311, Brownsville-Harlingen at
$14,087 and Laredo at $14,093.

   What do you do when your presidential candidate
is a bit too boring, lacking the star quality that sends crowds into
a frenzy? You cast your gaze on Hollywood and search the sports
arenas for the celebrities who can inject a little glamour into your
campaign.
   Robert Redford. Cher. Charlton Heston. Morgan Fairchild. John
Elway. Don Johnson.
   Aides to Democrat Michael Dukakis and Republican George Bush _
definite runners-up in the glamour category _ have enlisted the help
of Hollywood's box-office draws and sports' superstars to attract a
crowd, liven up a stump speech and capture a few more precious
seconds on the evening news.
   When Dukakis delivered a speech denouncing the Reagan
administration's environmental record to a college audience in New
Brunswick, N.J., he was accompanied by actor, director and
environmentalist Robert Redford.
   The blond-haired star of such movies as ``Butch Cassidy and the
Sundance Kid,'' ``Downhill Racer,'' ``The Candidate'' and ``Legal
Eagles'' drew squeals and cheers from the large crowd on the Rutgers
University campus.
   Redford also delivered a line that made every network news
program.
   ``Hello everybody, I'm Dan Quayle,'' joked Redford, whom Quayle
has been said to resemble.
   Redford continued his effort to help Dukakis, appearing at a
toxic landfill in Aurora, Colo., a once-heavily polluted river in
Seattle and other stops around the nation.
   ``I'm a citizen just like you are,'' Redford told the crowd in
Seattle earlier this month. ``Being an actor doesn't mean you lose
your citizenship.''
   At the Republican National Convention, the GOP had actor Charlton
Heston intone the Pledge of Allegiance in a voice many believe is
what God sounds like. It worked as delegates chattering and moving
about on the convention floor paused to join the ``Ben Hur'' and
``Ten Commandments'' star in reciting the pledge.
   Even before Bush and Dukakis had secured the nominations, the
campaigns were using celebrities.
   Tennis star Pam Shriver, in her job with the Bush campaign,
called members of Bush's ``1139 Club,'' which included current and
former party officials selected as delegates to the convention. The
number 1,139 was the total needed to win the GOP nomination.
   Through a questionnaire, the campaign determined delegate
background information such as birthdays, personal interests and
issues of most concern.
   ``It's an effort to create a national Bush family,'' said David
Sparks, who served as Bush's chief delegate counter.
   Ms. Shriver, who was assigned three or four delegates to keep in
touch with, was available to discuss both the vice president's
campaign and how to improve a cross-court volley.
   Former New York Giants and Minnesota Vikings quarterback Fran
Tarkenton, now an Atlanta businessman, has served as honorary Bush
campaign co-chairman in Georgia where he is recruiting businessmen.
   ``We need to get off the seats of our pants,'' Tarkenton said
last month in announcing his plans.
   But involvement in the political process doesn't always draw
praise. When Penn State football coach Joe Paterno agreed to deliver
a seconding speech for Bush at the GOP convention, the state's
Democratic Gov. Bob Casey criticized Paterno, questioning whether a
state college coach should take on such a high-profile political
posture.
   Paterno, who coached his football team to a national championship
two years ago, gave the speech anyway.
   Fifty celebrities, including Ms. Fairchild, Cher, Gregory Peck
and Hollywood's ``Brat Pack'' star Rob Lowe, chose to help the
Democratic cause by traveling to cities in California, Oregon and
Washington for a voter registration drive.
   Meanwhile, some of their compatriots in the Los Angeles area met
for the traditional Hollywood political event _ a fund-raiser with
the candidate. Television producer Norman Lear held the celebrity
fete last month for Dukakis, with ``Miami Vice'' star Johnson, actor
Burgess Meredith, comedian Chevy Chase and actress Goldie Hawn in
attendance.
   Some superstars, however, get involved without knowing it.
   Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle received Denver
Broncos quarterback John Elway's autograph and jersey during the GOP
candidate's stop in Colorado.
   The team's treasurer and chief financial officer made the
presentation _ unbeknown to Elway.
   ``I'm glad (Quayle) got it, instead of Dukakis, because I'm going
for Bush,'' Elway said when informed of the gift.

<HEAD>Likud Supporters Attack Peres, Head of Labor Party Leader</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN IZENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Election violence broke out after a two-week
lull when Likud supporters tried to push past police to attack the
car of Foreign Minister and Labor Party leader Shimon Peres, the
Itim news agency reported.
   Nine Likud supporters were arrested in Tuesday's skirmish in the
Tel Aviv suburb of Petah Tikva.
   Itim also reported that unknown assailants twice fired shots at
the headquarters of the Communist party, Hadash, in the Arab city of
Nazareth in northern Israel.
   Earlier in the campaign, protesters threw stones at Peres and his
second-in-command, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, during separate
appearances in the towns of Kiryat Gat and Afula. During a rally in
Beit Shemesh, a 61-year-old man dumped a cup of beer on Peres.
   The violence appeared to taper off after Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, leader of the right-wing Likud Party, appealed to party
activists for calm.
   Dozens of Likud supporters, however, showed up Tuesday at a Peres
rally in Petah Tikva and heckled the leader of the left-leaning
Labor Party as he delivered a campaign speech.
   Later, they rushed at Peres' car after police formed a protective
circle and tried to hustle him away from in front of city hall.
   Earlier Tuesday, police and bodyguards surrounded Peres as he
campaigned at the crowded central bus station in Jerusalem.
   Dozens of admirers drowned out the boos of opponents with the cry
``Peres will bring peace.''
   One businessman said he would vote Labor because the party
promises to hand back the densely inhabited portions of the
territories Israel seized from Egypt and Jordan in the 1967 Middle
East war.
   ``Peres says he'll give away the Gaza Strip. That's half our
demographic problem right there,'' businessman Shimon Rosen said.
   During the campaign, Labor has used the euphemism ``demographic
problem'' to refer to the fact that Palestinians will eventually
outnumber Jews if Israel holds on to the occupied territories.
   At least 1.5 million Arabs live in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
and 700,000 more live inside Israel. The Jewish population of Israel
is about 3.5 million but is growing at a far slower rate than the
Arab population.
   Labor urges handing control of large parts of the occupied
territories to Jordan to assure a Jewish majority inside Israel.
   The 11-month uprising against Israeli rule by Palestinians in the
occupied lands that has claimed the lives of at least 303
Palestinians and six Israelis. Thousands of Palestinians have been
wounded and arrested.
   The reported shooting in Nazareth was the latest in a series of
incidents in the Arab sector primarily involving the three Arab
parties _ Hadash, the Progressive List for Peace, and the Arab
Democratic Party.
   The Arab parties and some Jewish ones are vying for the 350,000
votes in the Arab sector. In some villages, party activists have
been roughed up and warned to stop their activities by members of
rival groups.
   Polls indicate that the race between Labor and Likud, uneasy
partners in the current governing coalition, is closely contested.
The election is Nov. 1.

<HEAD>Webster Says Chemical, Germ Weapons Threats Growing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Determining which countries are making chemical
and biological weapons will be one of the most difficult challenges
facing the CIA in the next decade, the agency's director says.
   William Webster, who became head of the spy agency in May 1987,
said Tuesday that Libya is ``developing the largest chemical plant
that I know of for chemical warfare.''
   In a speech to the World Affairs Council, Webster said the
intelligence community must pay close attention to developments in
the Soviet Union, Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf in the 1990s.
   He also said morale at the agency was high, rejected the notion
that covert activities should be carried out by the military and
said congressional review plays an important role in guiding the spy
agency.
   He stressed his concern about chemical weapons, which he said
were used both by Iran and Iraq in their eight-year war that was
halted by a cease-fire in August.
   ``Intelligence support will be vital to the success of U.S.
efforts to prevent the use of chemical weapons,'' he said, noting
that President Reagan has called for an international conference to
revive a ban on chemical weapons. The United States will try to
block the export of chemical weapons and ballistic missile
technology, he said.
   Webster said chemical weapons, often referred to as the poor
man's nuclear arms, are being developed by more than 20 countries.
As many as 10 countries are working on production of biological
weapons.
   These weapons could affect stability in southeast Asia and in the
Middle East where the balance of power may be altered by the
production of chemical weapons by at least three Arab states: Syria,
Libya and Iraq.
   Of particular concern to the CIA is the possibility that
countries might arm ballistic weapons with chemical warheads, he
said.
   ``Virtually every city in the Middle East is now subject to such
an attack if these two types of weapons are combined,'' he said.
   Among the weapons that are being made are mustard gas, nerve
agents and some that use industrial chemicals such as cyanide and
phosgene.
   ``Most of these plants look like nothing more than fertilizer
plants and are difficult to detect,'' he said.
   ``Assessing the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons
is one of the most difficult challenges we face in the intelligence
community, now and into the next decade. It is also one of our most
important tasks for these weapons may well represent one of the most
serious threats to world peace in the coming years,'' he said.
   Discussing U.S.-Soviet relations, Webster said Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms present intelligence agents ``with a
very formidable challenge.'' The CIA must assess the impact of the
reforms.
   Regardless of the arms control agreements signed between the
United States and the Soviet Union, Webster said, ``our relationship
is likely to remain adversarial.''
   The CIA head said he expects the Soviets will adhere to their
plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan by next February, but
Moscow will continue to maintain ties to the Kabul regime.
   ``We believe Afghanistan will remain unstable for a period of
time,'' he said. The Afghan rebels will likely continue fighting
among themselves, and 5 million refugees, the majority of whom are
in Pakistan, must be resettled.
   Although Moslems predominate in Afghanistan, Webster said the CIA
does not believe a fundamentalist regime such as that of Iran's
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini will dominate.
   With the end of the Iran-Iraq war, intelligence analysts will try
to find out what each country's intention is in the region. The
Americans also want to learn what effect the war's end will have on
the American hostages held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian groups, he said.

<HEAD>Reagan Decides Dispute Over Inspections Needed Under Strategic
Weapons Treaty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan has resolved a dispute between
the State and Defense Departments over how much on-site inspection
should be sought in negotiations with the Soviet Union on a treaty
to reduce long-range nuclear missiles, according to a report
published today.
   The New York Times says the president chose a plan backed by the
State Department. Civilian Defense Department leaders had argued in
favor of a far broader verification proposal.
   Under the proposal chosen, a list of sites would be agreed upon
at which each side could conduct short-notice inspections, The Times
says. Each country would be given the right to conduct snap
inspections at these designated sites, mainly those used to make
rocket motors for solid-fuel missiles, said the newspaper, citing
unidentified administration officials.
   Each country also would have the right to request quick
inspections of any facility in the other's territory, but if the
facility was not on the list of designated sites, the request could
be denied.
   The party that rejected the inspection would be required to
explain its reasons and to take action to alleviate the other side's
concerns over possible cheating, The Times said.
   The newspaper said the plan was generally supported by the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency as well as the State Department.
   The treaty banning intermediate-range nuclear missiles, ratified
by both countries, provides for short-notice inspections of missile
sites and stationing inspectors at one missile assembly plant in
each country.
   U.S. and Soviet strategic arms negotiators are expected to recess
their talks in Geneva in mid-November and not resume them until next
year.

<TEXT>
   Key problems among children in America's
cities, including drug abuse, pregnancy and school dropouts, have
grown worse over the past five years, according to a report released
today by the U.S. Conference of Mayors.
   These problems, plus inadequate health care for children in
low-income families and a lack of affordable child care, worsened in
80 percent of the cities that cited them, the study said.
   The report surveyed officials in 52 cities in 22 states and the
District of Columbia. It was financed by the Foundation for Child
Development and published by the U.S. Conference of City Human
Services Officials, an affiliate of the U.S. Conference of Mayors.
   J. Thomas Cochran, executive director of the mayor's group and
the affiliate, said the report was intended to ``lead us toward
critically needed investments in our children's future and,
consequently, in our country's future.''
   The study also said poverty was a high-priority problem facing
children in urban areas.
   It estimated that 28.5 percent of the more than 18.5 million
children living in central cities live in poverty, compared with a
20 percent poverty rate for all U.S. children.
   The study found problems affecting children in the cities include:
   _Insufficient day care. It said an estimated 45 percent of the
need for licensed child care goes unmet.
   _A 38 percent average high school dropout rate in the class of
1988 even though 60 percent of the cities reported investing public
money in programs to encourage students to stay in school.
   _A 14.6 percent rate of births to mostly unmarried teen-age
mothers among the 529,458 births in the survey cities during 1986.
The rate of births to black teens was even higher at 21.6 percent
that year.
   _An infant mortality rate among blacks of 18.5 per thousand in
1986, compared with a rate of 12.6 per thousand for all infants.
   The report said mayors of the survey cities believe the most
important policy decisions to be made by the next president for the
benefit of children ``would be to increase the availability of child
care, provide adequate funding for family and children's programs,
increase the emphasis on and funding for substance abuse prevention,
and make a greater investment in education.''

<HEAD>Ex-Whiz Kid Testifies He Was Frightened Into Fraud</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fallen whiz kid who made and lost millions
in carpet cleaning admitted at his securities fraud trial he was so
desperate to keep the business afloat he stole his grandmother's
jewelry.
   Barry Minkow, seeking to dispel his image as a corrupt business
prodigy, testified Tuesday that he was a frightened little boy
manipulated by extortionists.
   ``I didn't know what to do,'' said Minkow, who admitted he
perpetrated a multimillion-dollar swindle that defrauded investors
of about $25 million. ``I was in the 11th grade. I had a lot of
trouble sleeping. I knew I was in a lot of trouble.''
   Minkow, now 22, took the stand as the first defense witness and
told jurors how his youthful ambition led him to form the ZZZZ Best
carpet cleaning company at age 16 in his parent's garage.
   But he said he could not have done it without a $1,600 loan from
a man he portrayed as his Svengali, Daniel Krowpman.
   ``He was my idol,'' Minkow told jurors. ``He was everything
because he had money; he had build. He had everything I didn't have.
... He was nice to me. He was like the father I never had. I loved
him.''
   But Minkow blamed all his troubles on Krowpman, a co-defendant
who has pleaded guilty to verifying false ZZZZ Best invoices.
   Minkow portrayed Krowpman as a 230-pound weight lifter and loan
shark with a retinue of muscular thug enforcers. He said Krowpman
once tried to sexually molest him.
   For his $1,600 loan, Minkow said Krowpman demanded $200-a-week
payments plus half the company's profits.
   Later, he testified, another co-defendant, Tom Padgett, demanded
10 percent of the profits for a loan he provided. Minkow said
Padgett was ``a Nazi'' who defamed Minkow's Jewish heritage.
   ``I felt like I was taking money from the devil,'' said Minkow.
   He said the pressures for loan shark payments drove him to steal
his grandmother's jewelry, and ``I bounced checks everywhere.''
   ``I had to pay Krowpman,'' he said. ``That was first. Everything
else was second. I went from bank to bank. Nothing else mattered.''
   Once, he said, he spoke of calling the police, and Krowpman
threatened him.
   ``What did he say would happen?'' asked Minkow's lawyer, David
Kenner.
   ``He'd kill me,'' Minkow replied in a near whisper.
   During pauses in his testimony, Minkow alternately chewed on his
fingernails and bit chunks out of a Styrofoam cup.
   The prosecution has portrayed Minkow as a shrewd con man who
knowingly defrauded investors and banks out of about $25 million.
   Kenner has said that Minkow would prove he committed crimes under
duress, fearful he would be killed by Krowpman and other
mob-connected figures.
   But U.S. District Judge Dickran Tavrizian barred any mention of
organized crime connections Tuesday, saying that ``guilt by
association is not permitted.''
   Minkow began his testimony by admitting in a halting, soft voice
that he had committed the crimes with which he is charged. He
frequently paused and cast his eyes downward as he made his
admissions.
   Asked by Kenner whether he had made false claims for his
now-defunct business, Minkow replied: ``It's true. I made those
claims and they were all lies.''
   Minkow is charged with 57 counts, including securities fraud,
credit card fraud and mail fraud. Ten of his 12 co-defendants,
including Krowpman and Padgett, pleaded guilty. Accountant Norman
Rothberg is on trial with Minkow, accused of taking a bribe to cover
up ZZZZ Best's frauds.
   The trial began in August.

   The mayor's dog, Pumpkin, earned a junior
policeman's badge for scaring a fleeing suspect onto the roof of an
abandoned house and standing guard until help arrived.
   ``The police chief had some junior police badges, these stick-on
deals they give to kids,'' said Fred Amos, mayor of this central
Oklahoma town. ``He put one on top of her head and made her an
official police dog.''
   Pumpkin helped capture 19-year-old David Scott Huffman on
Tuesday, who bolted from the Okfuskee County courthouse while being
arraigned on charges of unlawful possession of a motor vehicle and
feloniously carrying a firearm, according to Sheriff Roy Nichols.
   Amos and his son heard the report of Huffman's escape over a
police scanner, and the mayor saw Huffman run into an abandoned
house.
   ``I sent my dog in ahead,'' Amos said. He said Pumpkin chased
Huffman, who was hiding in an upstairs utility room, onto the roof.
   ``He sat out there on the roof, and the dog sat there on the
ground and watched him like a squirrel in a tree,'' Amos said.

   A stubborn government computer finally
coughed up a Social Security number for 13-year-old Jeanette Wicker
after confusing her for months with her twin sister, Jeanelle.
   Tom and Millie Wicker sought Social Security numbers for the
twins, and obtained one for Jeanelle without difficulty.
   But because the girls' first names begin with the same five
letters and they share the same middle initial, the Social Security
Administration computer wouldn't acknowledge that Jeanette existed.
   Mrs. Wicker submitted five applications for Jeanette. The
situation turned serious when Wicker, a General Motors Corp.
repairman, was threatened with the loss of insurance coverage for
Jeanette unless he could produce the number.
   William T. Clynes, district manager of the Social Security office
in Saginaw, untangled the mystery after being contacted by the
Saginaw News.
   ``We had to manually input the information to get the computer to
recognize it was Jeanette, not Jeanelle, who needed a number,''
Clynes said. ``Those names are just too close in spelling.''
   Clynes apologized to the family. ``No one should have to come
down here five times,'' he said. ``Hopefully, it will never happen
again.''

<HEAD>Federal Court Orders Diet Patch Promoters to Stop Advertising</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the
promoters of EuroTrim Diet Patches to stop their national
advertisements, which feature Michael Reagan, the president's son,
the U.S. Postal Service announced.
   The order will remain in effect until the promoters can produce
scientific evidence demonstrating that the diet patches actually aid
in weight reduction, said Steve Schneringer, a postal inspector in
Pasadena, Calif.
   The Postal Inspection Service opened an investigation of EuroTrim
in August and participated in a U.S. Justice Department suit filed
Sept. 26 that alleges the diet patch is worthless.
   The principal defendants named in the suit operated Twin Star
Productions of Scottsdale, Ariz., and Ameuro Sciences International
of Thousand Oaks, Calif.
   Michael Reagan, who was not named as a defendant, said he was
nothing more than a hired actor in the promotion of the product, the
Postal Service said. Reagan was a talk show host in a 30-minute
video promotion for EuroTrim, which was released nationwide, the
Postal Service said.
   Reagan, who lives in suburban Los Angeles, did not immediately
return a telephone call Tuesday evening seeking comment.
   Promoters claim that a diet patch placed on a user's wrist emits

<HEAD>Washington Archdiocese Made Secret Settlement Of Sex Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Archdiocese of Washington made a secret
out-of-court settlement with a 20-year-old man who sued the church
for negligence after he was molested by a Catholic priest in the
early 1980s, The Washington Post reported today.
   The newspaper, citing a source it did not identify, said the
archdiocese agreed to pay a six-figure sum in the settlement reached
Oct. 14.
   In exchange for the settlement, the plaintiff, who was not
identified by name, agreed to the archdiocese's request for a court
order sealing the case file to prohibit public disclosure of the
evidence or the settlement amount, the Post said.
   The court order sealing the case was signed by Montgomery County,
Md., Circuit Judge Stanley B. Frosh.
   The trial on the lawsuit had been scheduled before Frosh next
month.
   The plaintiff was one of three teen-agers sexually abused in the
early 1980s by the Rev. Peter M. McCutcheon, who was arrested and
pleaded guilty to criminal charges in 1986.
   The plaintiff, who had sought $2 million in damages in Montgomery
County Circuit Court, alleged that church officials ``knew of or
should have known'' of McCutcheon's pedophilia before he was
arrested.
   McCutcheon, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison after
pleading guilty to molestation charges, later had the sentence
reduced to probation on condition that he move into a church-run
treatment center in New Mexico. He is there now. He was ordained in
1979 and committed the sexual assaults when he was a priest at two
churches in Prince George's County, Md.
   James C. Brincefield, the plaintiff's attorney, said he
recommended his client accept the settlement because, ``I never had
any doubt we'd win the case, but I was concerned about the length of
time it would take (to collect an award) and the uncertainty
involved in multiple levels of appeal.''
   Anthony P. Interdonato, an attorney for the archdiocese, refused
to discuss any payment by the church but said the settlement
included ``absolutely no admission of liability whatsoever'' by
church officials.

   The Air Force will roll out its ``Stealth''
bomber on Nov. 22, but the first official public viewing may not
completely lift the veil from the plane.
   The Pentagon said Tuesday the B-2 bomber will be rolled out at
the government-owned plant in Palmdale, Calif., and that the plane's
first flight will likely occur soon afterward.
   Defense Department spokesman Dan Howard said, however, he
``wouldn't be a bit surprised'' if the Air Force limited the guest
list for the ceremony as well as the ``aspects'' _ or viewing angles
_ from which the new plane was viewed.
   Some aspects of the technology are still highly classified, he

   Castleberry's Food Co., Augusta, Ga., is
voluntarily recalling 51,985 cans of corned beef hash in six states
because 912 cans did not go through the required heat processing.
   The recall affects suspected products in Alabama, Georgia, North

Department said Tuesday. Officials said the suspected corn beef
could contain food poisoning organisms, including some that could
cause botulism.
   The product, Castleberry's Single Serve Canned Corned Beef Hash,
is packaged in 7{-ounce cans with pull tabs and is sold mostly in
vending machines.
   The products are identified by the code numbers 2J81CBV3 or

leading to this secluded beach town 15 miles north of San Francisco.
   On Friday, officers spotted two men tearing down the 3-by-9-foot

<DATELINE>GREAT FALLS, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis' presidential campaign
plans to take the unprecedented step of buying television time for
his running mate, Lloyd Bentsen, as part of its final pre-election
push.
   The campaign has purchased a five-minute block of time on the CBS
television network on Sunday night and will probably air a spot that
Bentsen tapes late today in Los Angeles, said Tad Devine, who
coordinates Bentsen's campaign for Dukakis.
   ``We want to take full advantage of all the assets we have,''
said Devine, mentioning Bentsen's high ratings from the public,
especially when combined with the low ratings given his Republican
counterpart, Dan Quayle.
   ``The combination of the two is really very powerful,'' he said.
   Bentsen lately has been attacking the Republicans for negative
campaigning and what he calls a character assassination of Dukakis.
   ``The kind of campaign these Republicans are waging would tear
the heart out of a democracy,'' he told a rally Tuesday night in
Great Falls, Mont.
   The Republicans started right after the Democratic convention
with a smear campaign ranging from claiming Dukakis was mentally ill
to saying that his wife, Kitty, had burned the flag _ ``All
outrageous lies'' _ Bentsen said.
   Bush campaign ads saying that Dukakis would weaken the U.S.
military were untrue, he said, as was their claim that Dukakis
planned to take guns away from sportsmen.
   Bentsen has been receiving enthusiastic responses from the crowds
where he speaks. More than a thousand people packed the courtyard
Tuesday night rally in a casino hotel in Great Falls and cheered
wildly as Bentsen spoke in front of an enormous American flag and
all of the state's top elected Democrats.
   But in the national news he has been working in the shadows of
the two presidential candidates, said his press secretary, Mike
McCurry.
   Increased television exposure, including a planned appearance on
the ``CBS Evening News'' tonight and the paid time on Sunday night,
could help deliver that message to more of the electorate, he said.
   ``I think he wants to say something about the campaign and the
quality of the campaign,'' McCurry said. ``I think there will be a
concentrated effort to make people aware of the broadcast,''
including some paid advertising, he said.
   Never before has a campaign bought network time for its vice
presidential candidate and less than a week ago the campaign was
leaning against such a move, Devine said. But the plan fit in with
the overall effort by Dukakis to seek maximum exposure in the final
two weeks of the campaign, he said, noting that Dukakis' own
television schedule was heavier than Bentsen's.
   Bentsen stumped through the Dakotas and into Montana on Tuesday.
The states have only 10 electoral votes between them. But the
Democrats contend they have a good shot at South Dakota and Montana
especially, and those states could make the difference in a close
election.
   From states with the fewest electoral votes, Bentsen was flying
today to California, which at 47 has the most clout in the Electoral
College.

<HEAD>Government-Opposition Talks in Doubt Over Participation of
Activists</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist authorities insisted on yet
another preliminary meeting with Lech Walesa before round-table
talks with the opposition can begin, but the Solidarity chairman
refused.
   The dispute arose Tuesday when the government said it wanted to
discuss its objection to two Solidarity delegates to the talks,
which authorities agreed to in August in return for an end to
Poland's worst labor unrest in seven years.
   Walesa said in a telephone interview that he would not agree to
the government's demand that he meet today with Interior Minister
Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak on the matter.
   ``I will not allow any personnel changes,'' he said. ''It could
be a precedent, a dangerous precedent for the future.''
   A statement issued later by Solidarity national spokesman Janusz
Onyskiewicz ruled out any change in the banned free trade union
movement's delegation but expressed hope that the long-awaited talks
could begin.
   Poland's planned economy is in crisis, with wages lagging far
behind consumer prices, which the government raised by an average of
40 percent earlier this year.
   A communique issued by the official PAP news agency after the
ruling Politburo's weekly meeting Tuesday said the government was
firmly committed to the talks and expressed hope that ``remaining
controversies will be quickly removed in the course of preparatory
talks.''
   The squabble began when government spokesman Jerzy Urban said a
fourth preparatory meeting between Walesa and Kiszczak was
``indispensible'' for the talks to begin.
   The government objects to two people proposed by Solidarity to
participate and wants clarification on whether the two _ advisors
Jacek Kuron and Adam Michnik _ agree to accept the leading role of
the communist party, Urban said.
   He said Walesa and Kiszczak should meet today, and if they
settled their differences the talks could begin Friday.
   Urban charged that Solidarity's ``stubbornness'' was preventing
the talks from beginning, but said the Friday date did not represent
an ultimatum and the government would be willing to meet later,
assuming questions about participation and other technical matters
were resolved.
   Walesa said he had not given up hope for the talks to bring about
``understanding and the implementation of pluralism,'' but he said
another meeting with Kiszczak was unnecessary.
   Urban said the government has problems with the participation of
Kuron and Michnik because the two don't respect Poland's
constitutional order, which guarantees the communist party's leading
role.
   ``If Jacek Kuron and Adam Michnik really wish to participate in
the conciliation process, it would be no problem for them to
publicly declare that they respect and will respect the
constitutional order,'' he said.
   Kuron declined comment. A telephone call to Michnik's home went
unanswered.
   In a first meeting with Kiszczak on Aug. 31, Walesa agreed to
bring a halt to a wave of strikes after being guaranteed that the
talks would address the reinstatement of Solidarity, the only
independent labor movement ever allowed in the Soviet bloc.
   The opposition has demanded that the talks lead to the
legalization of Solidarity, which was outlawed after a December 1981
military crackdown.
   But Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski said Friday he opposes
such a move until the economy is healthier and changes in the system
allow political demands to be vented outside of trade unions.
   The government said Monday a specially built round table capable
of seating more than 50 people had been set up at its Jablonna
Palace in suburban Warsaw in readiness for the talks.
   Invited to attend the talks in addition to Solidarity are
representatives of the powerful Roman Catholic Church, official
trade unions and government-approved social groups.

<HEAD>Amnesty: Death Squad Assassinations Up Sharply Last Two Years In
Salvador</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BEN DOBBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The revival of death squads in El Salvador has
resulted in the assassination of hundreds of suspected government
opponents during the past two years, Amnesty International said
today.
   The re-emergence of death squads, usually made up of troops and
police, coincides with the armed forces' open opposition to the
policies of President Jose Napoleon Duarte, the London-based human
rights organization charged.
   Members of the clandestine death squads customarily wear plain
clothes, use unmarked trucks or vans with tinted windows, and often
dump mutilated victims on the roadside ``as a means of terrifying
the population,'' it said in a report.
   Some victims are shot from passing cars in daylight in front of
witnesses, while others are seized from their homes or in the street
and ``never heard of again'' or turn up in notorious ``body dumps,''
the report said.
   The death-squad killings ``are routinely carried out by regular
units of the armed forces which include the military and the
security services, and by special intelligence units that
incorporate civilian gunmen under their supervision and control,''
it said.
   Since early 1987, victims have included trade unionists, human
rights workers, returned refugees and members of the judiciary
attempting to establish responsibility for human rights violations,
the report said.
   Abductions and attacks have often occurred near police or
military installations ``or under the gaze of uniformed security
personnel who made no effort to intervene,'' it said.
   The squads intimidate opponents by publishing ``death lists'' in
newspaper advertisements and delivering coffins to the homes of
intended victims, the report said.
   Dumped bodies frequently are found decapitated, dismembered,
strangled or showing marks of rape or torture, such as burns and
machete wounds, it said.
   Military authorities abducted and summarily executed tens of
thousands of suspected leftists in the late 1970s and early 1980s,
but the killings dropped off sharply after Duarte's U.S.-backed
civilian administration came to power in 1984, the report said.
   The government says the killings are the work of extremists who
act independently and cannot be apprehended, but Amnesty
International's report said ``evidence gathered over many years from
a wide range of sources points to security force responsibility.''
   A lava bed 12 miles north of El Salvador called El Playon, where
skeletons of bodies devoured by birds of prey were common in the
early 1980s, fell into disuse until an unidentified body was found
there in January, the report said.
   Bodies also are again being dumped at a site known as the Devil's
Doorway at Panchimalco, 12 miles southeast of the capital, the
report said.
   In 1987, an average of 12 bodies a month ``showing death
squad-style mutilations'' were found dumped along roadsides, it said.
   It said Tutela Legal, a Roman Catholic human rights group in San
Salvador, estimates as many death squad-style disappearances and
killings occurred in the first quarter of this year as in all of
1987.
   Amnesty International gave no estimate of the number of
death-squad killings over the last six months.
   Other deliberate killings have been falsely ascribed by armed
forces' spokesmen to clashes with opposition forces, the report said.
   Amnesty International said renewed death-squad killings ``have
occurred as the armed forces high command has expressed open
opposition'' to Duarte's policies, including his negotiations with
leftist guerrillas.
   The assassination a year ago of Herbert Anaya Sanabria, president
of the Salvadoran Human Rights Commission, ``was widely interpreted
as an attempt to hamper these negotiations,'' the report said.
   It said reports this summer that Duarte is terminally ill with
cancer have been ``another factor affording the armed forces even
greater control over counter-insurgency policies.''
   The 9-year civil war has killed an estimated 65,000 people, most
of them civilians.

   A man who claimed he found a mouse in a
can of beer was sentenced to 18 months in prison and apologized
after pleading guilty to product tampering and extortion.
   ``I want to publicly admit that I caused a mouse to be placed in
a can of Coors beer and acknowledge the wrongdoing of that act,''
James N. Harvey, 30, said in court Tuesday.
   Circuit Judge R. Hudson Olliff gave Harvey until Nov. 1 to begin
serving his sentence.
   Harvey claimed he discovered the mouse July 27 after taking a few
drinks from a 16-ounce can of Coors.
   He called the Coors' consumer hotline two days later. Coors
initially offered to pay $1,500 for the mouse and the can, but he
refused and later asked for $35,000.
   The apology was part of a plea bargain, said Assistant State
Attorney E. McRae Mathis.
   ``We felt in this case it was appropriate and it was necessary to
ensure that the consumer confidence in a consumer product was given
back to a company because that is the very thing that was taken away
from a company,'' said Mathis.
   Adolph Coors Co. of Golden, Colo., will drop a lawsuit against
Harvey for loss of sales and damage to its reputation, said company
spokeswoman Cary Baird.
   ``Our purpose in filing the lawsuit was not for revenge, but to
restore consumer confidence in our products,'' said company
President Peter H. Coors. ``We also wanted to send a clear message
that product tampering is a serious crime against consumer
confidence and trust that will not be tolerated.''
   Olliff sentenced Harvey to 18 months in prison on each of the two
counts and ordered that they be served concurrently.

   A young man who hit a police officer was
ordered jailed for a year and has to write a sentence as part of his
sentence: ``People do not have to put up with a jerk like me.'' One
hundred times a day for each day behind bars.
   As part the sentence for 19-year-old Steven R. Sommer, Circuit
Judge Michael Hoover stayed a 3{-year prison term and placed him on
five years' probation.
   ``It just seemed to me at the time that if I put this kid in
prison, he was going to come out one tough case,'' Hoover explained
in an interview Tuesday.
   The judge said Sommer's self-image may change if ``he has to
suffer the humiliation of being treated like a miscreant junior high
schooler'' by having to write the sentence a total of 36,500 times.
   Sommer, who kicked out a squad car window and was subdued by four
officers after being stopped for a traffic violation, pleaded guilty
last month to a felony battery charge.
   Hoover noted during Monday's sentencing that Sommer had shown no
remorse. He said he believed prison would offer little chance of
rehabilitation for someone who would probably tell fellow inmates he
had been convicted of ``beating up a cop.''
   ``My basic concern was not to reinforce the image he had of being
a tough you-know-what that people had to put up with or suffer the
consequences,'' the judge said Tuesday.
   Sommer was stopped Jan. 31 by Roger Watral, Marathon assistant
police chief, for speeding. Watral testified during a preliminary
hearing that Sommer became upset and used vulgar language when the
officer told him he was speeding.
   The officer said he smelled alcohol on Sommer's breath and later
saw a can of beer in the car.
   Sommer refused three times to do what the officer asked him to do
and ``made a mockery out of the field sobriety test,'' Watral
testified.
   When the officer tried to put handcuffs on the 6-foot-tall
Sommer, the man jerked his arm back, hitting the officer across the
lower lip, and kicked him in the groin, Watral said.
   Three other officers had to be called in to subdue Sommer,
authorities said.
   Sommer pleaded guilty to battery in exchange for the state
dropping charges of resisting arrest and causing criminal damage to
property. He was also cited for drunken driving as a third-time
offender and fined $1,331.

<TEXT>
   About 3,000 villagers in northern
Malaysia prayed together to seek protection from the evil spirits
they believe caused the mysterious deaths of 13 children this month,
a newspaper reported today.
   Villagers hung pamelo leaves and lemon grass on their front doors
to ward off the evil spirits they believe also caused 50 other
children to be hospitalized, the Star daily reported from Baru
Timah, about 120 miles north of Kuala Lumpur.
   They also lit three giant incense sticks and offered food as they
chanted prayers at the village marketplace.
   The mysterious ailment surfaced Oct. 15, and the government has
launched a probe to determine what is afflicting the children. Four
medical experts from Singapore flew to Malaysia Tuesday to help in
the investigation.
   The children vomited blood and experienced diarrhea and fever,
and may have been hit with food poisoning, said Martin Joseph, a
physician with Ipoh Government Hospital, where most of the deaths
occurred.
   Seventeen noodle factories in the area have been ordered closed
because many of those stricken had eaten noodles. People in the area

   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad visited nine children who remain
hospitalized Monday and said the government was doing its best to
determine the cause of the deaths.

<HEAD>Slasher Destroys Huge Pumpkin; Reward Offered For Seeds</HEAD>

   A reward is being offered for the great
pumpkin slasher, a vandal who destroyed what was billed as the
Midwest's largest gourd and took its valuable seeds, authorities
said.
   The pre-Halloween prank has dumbfounded residents of this upscale
suburb north of Chicago, where the 354-pound pumpkin was on display
at the posh Bannockburn Green Retail Center.
   The slasher cut the pumpkin and made off with half of it and all
the seeds.
   ``Someone did a very clean job of it,'' Enid Pesmen, property
manager of the center, said Tuesday.
   She bought the pumpkin for $200 from a grower in Nekoosa, Wis.,
to use as a Halloween promotion at the center. It was to replace the
center's annual pumpkin giveaway, canceled this year because of the
drought, said center spokeswoman Susan Hill.
   The grower, Gary Keyzer, won the Midwest Pumpkin Weigh-Off
contest earlier this month with the mammoth pumpkin, and agreed to
part with it if the seeds were returned to him, Ms. Hill said.
   The center had planned to keep the pumpkin on display outdoors
until Halloween, then offer it to bakeries to make pies for the
hungry, Ms. Hill said.
   But during the weekend, the slasher struck. Workmen found the
remains of the pumpkin Saturday night.
   Mrs. Pesmen said she has no idea who might have pulled such a
stunt.
   ``I assume they really wanted the seeds,'' she said.
   She has offered a reward of about $100 for return of the seeds,
but has little hope of finding the thief.
   ``I don't know how we're going to find someone with half a
pumpkin and seeds,'' she said.
   The mystery may not be identified until next growing season, if a
patch of giant pumpkins crops up in Bannockburn.
   ``That's what we're going to be on the look-out for,'' Ms. Pesmen
said.

   The U.S. dollar inched down against the Japanese yen
Wednesday, while share prices rose on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 126.80 yen, down 0.07 yen from Tuesday's
close of 126.87 yen. Opening at 126.67 yen, the currency moved
between 126.64-126.85 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
139.95 points Tuesday, gained another 199.11 points, or 0.73
percent, to close at 27,620.60.
   The market's main index was up 99.51 points shortly after trading
began and continued to rise throughout the morning session.
   The positive environment for stock investment, including
prospects for lower interest rates and declining oil prices,
outweighed investors' concerns over negative factors such as the
Recruit stock scandal, a Daiwa Securities trader said.
   Recruit Corp., an information-related conglomerate, is at the
center of a political scandal involving a subsidiary's offering of
unlisted shares at bargain prices to senior Japanese politicians and
other figures.

<HEAD>Jury Orders KKK To Pay $1 Million To Rights Marchers</HEAD>

   A state lawmaker vowed to seek wages, guns and
even Confederate flags from 11 Klansmen to collect his share of a $1
million award to civil rights marchers pelted with rocks in nearly
all-white Forsyth County.
   A federal jury found the Ku Klux Klansmen and two white
supremacist groups responsible for disrupting the Jan. 17, 1987,
march north of Atlanta, and awarded $948,650 in damages to 49
demonstrators who filed suit.
   ``It is a message to the Ku Klux Klan nationwide that this can
happen to you,'' said state Rep. J.E. ``Billy'' McKinney, one of the
demonstrators.
   McKinney said he and the other plaintiffs ``are determined we
will get every dime that we can get out of the Klan.''
   The award, the second major one involving a Klan organization in
two years, includes $400,000 each from the Southern White Knights of
the Ku Klux Klan and the Invisible Empire Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan. David Holland, grand dragon of the Southern White Knights, was
ordered to pay $50,000, the highest of the 11 defendants.
   ``I guarantee if (Holland's) got a pickup truck, I'm going to
take it. If he's got a shotgun in the back (of the truck), I'm going
to take it, too _ and I want his Confederate flag,'' McKinney said.
   Defense attorneys were stunned by the verdict unsealed Tuesday
and said they would appeal. Holland's attorney, Jeffrey Sliz, called
it ``grossly unreasonable.''
   Another defense attorney, Jane Plaginos, said the plaintiffs had
no proof for any injury that would mandate such severe damages.
   ``They did not prove anybody was hurt, literally, or lost wages,
anything. They did not prove anything,'' she said.
   She said that within 30 days she would ask U.S. District Judge
Charles A. Moye Jr. to dismiss or lower the damages.
   The jury reached its verdict Oct. 5, agreeing that the violence
amounted to a violation of the marchers' civil right. Moye ordered
the verdict sealed until Tuesday to give those who brought the
lawsuit time to decide whether to join City Councilman Hosea
Williams, who wanted to drop it.
   Williams, who helped organize the march and was among those who
filed the lawsuit, urged toward the end of the trial that the suit
be dropped because it would impoverish the families of KKK members.
   Williams said he has forgiven the Klan ``and other white
supremacists for brutalizing us'' during the march.
   There had been 57 plaintiffs. Williams and three others dropped
out during the trial and four others dropped out Tuesday.
   The jury awarded $50 to each plaintiffs in compensatory damages.
The rest was in punitive damages. The lawsuit had sought $1.5
million.
   One defendant was found not liable.
   Ed Stephens, grand dragon of the Invisible Empire Knights, was
ordered to pay $30,000 but he said the marchers may have a hard time
collecting it.
   ``If the $30,000 holds up, and I don't feel that it will hold up,
they would play the devil getting it,'' Stephens said. ``I don't
have anything such as that.''
   Stephens, an electrician, said he rents his home.
   The march was a forerunner to a larger demonstration a week later
in which an estimated 24,000 people turned out. State, local, county
and federal troops were called out to protect the marchers and
prevent violence.
   In February 1987, an all-white federal jury in Alabama awarded a
black woman, Beulah Mae Donald, $7 million from the United Klans of
America and six members or former members of the group after her
son, Michael Donald, was beaten, strangled and hanged in a tree in
1981 at age 19.
   Attorney Morris Dees, who represented marchers in the Georgia
case, was also an attorney for the family in the Alabama case. He
heads the Montgomery, Ala.-based Southern Poverty Law Center, which
operates a group called Klanwatch.

<HEAD>Dukakis Loses Appeal Challenging Federal Authority Over National
Guard</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has rejected Democratic
presidential candidate Michael Dukakis' attempt to use his power as
governor to block a Massachusetts National Guard training mission in
Central America.
   The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a one-sentence order
Tuesday affirming a May 6 decision by U.S. District Judge Robert
Keeton, who upheld federal supremacy over the National Guard.
   ``Having examined the briefs of the parties ... and having had
the benefit of oral argument, we affirm the judgment on the basis
stated in the district court's well-reasoned opinion,'' the appeals
court said.
   Dukakis sued in January to block the assignment of 13 public
relations specialists in the Massachusetts Guard to Honduras and
Panama for two weeks in May because of his opposition to Reagan
administration policies in the region.
   In his presidential campaign, Dukakis has denounced the
administration for its ``failed and illegal'' policy of supporting
Nicaraguan rebels, and he said sending Guard troops to the region
was an attempt to intimidate Nicaragua.
   Dukakis, who was campaigning Tuesday in California and Colorado,
had no immediate comment on the appellate decision. A press aide,
Steven Crawford, said the governor was disappointed that the court
chose not to uphold the ``important principle'' of state authority.
   State Attorney General James Shannon, who represented Dukakis in
court, said he would wait until another federal appeals court rules
in a similar challenge before deciding whether to appeal to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
   John Bolton, chief of the civil division in the U.S. Justice
Department, said he was pleased by the ruling: ``It represents the
complete vindication of the administration's position.''
   After Keeton issued his ruling in May, Dukakis appealed but did
not try to stop the Massachusetts troops from participating in the
exercises, which involved road-building.
   In his decision, Keeton explicitly upheld the constitutionality
of the Montgomery Amendment, a 1986 act of Congress that says
governors may not decline such assignments ``because of any
objection to the location, purpose, type or schedule of such
activity.''
   ``At issue in this case is the constitutional status of the
modern National Guard,'' Keeton wrote, framing his question in terms
of competing clauses in the U.S. Constitution that divided control
over the new nation's militia between the federal government and the
states.
   Lawyers for the U.S. Justice Department argued that the ``Army
Clause'' in the Constitution gives Congress the ultimate say over
the nation's entire military apparatus. They described Dukakis'
position as ``a dagger aimed at the heart of national defense.''
   The Massachusetts' attorney general's office, representing
Dukakis, had claimed that the ``Militia Clause'' reserved power to
the governors over training the militia.
   Assistant Attorney General Douglas Wilkins stressed the
``original intent'' of the Constitution's framers, arguing that
state control over the ``militia'' was essentially undisturbed by
the many reorganizations of the nation's military.
   Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich, joined by Massachusetts and nine
other states, challenged the law last year in U.S. District Court in
St. Paul and lost. The case is now on appeal.

<HEAD>First Lady Calls For Punishment of Wall Street Bankers Who Use
Cocaine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nancy Reagan has called for an all-out
domestic war on drug users, saying Wall Street bankers who use
cocaine should be punished along with dealers, smugglers and
Colombian drug kingpins.
   America _ not foreign drug producers _ bears responsibility for
its narcotics problem, the First Lady said in a speech Tuesday at
the United Nations.
   Each American drug user, she said, ``is an accomplice to every
criminal act, every murder, every terrorist attack carried out by
the narcotics syndicates.''
   ``To get serious about stopping illegal drugs,'' Mrs. Reagan
said, ``that means confronting all those citizens who use drugs.''
If the United States cannot choke off the demand for drugs, she
said, there is little hope of halting production and smuggling.
   ``It is often easier to make strong speeches about foreign drug
lords or drug smugglers,'' she said, ``than to arrest a pair of Wall
Street investment bankers buying cocaine on their lunch break.''
   Mrs. Reagan made the comments in a speech to the U.N. Third
Committee on Social and Humanitarian Affairs. In 1985, she and other
first ladies addressed an international conference against drug
abuse at the United Nations when she sounded her anti-drug slogan:
``Just Say No.''
   In his eight years in office, President Reagan has advocated a
war on drug producers in Latin America and elsewhere, as well as the
interdiction of drugs smuggled into the United States.
   But the U.S. administration has been criticized for its dealings
with Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Noriega, indicted in the
United States for drug trafficking, and for not cracking down on
governments that allow domestic drug production.
   In her speech, Mrs. Reagan emphasized the need for police to
arrest and for courts to punish all drug users. It is as important
to stop drug use in the United States, she said, as it is to stop
coca-growing in Peru, processing in Colombia and shipping through
the Caribbean.
   ``It is the United States alone which bears responsibility for
its own drug problem,'' she said. ``While most of the illegal drugs
are imported, the drug users are home-grown.''
   ``If we lack the will to fully mobilize the forces of law in our
own country to arrest and punish drug users, if we cannot stem the
American demand for drugs,'' Mrs. Reagan said, ``Then there will be
little hope of preventing foreign drug producers from fulfilling
that demand.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Two women who were pen pals with Anne Frank and
her sister have sold the correspondence at auction for $150,000 and
plan to use the money to retire and to fund an organization for
Christian missionaries.
   The anonymous buyer, who also paid a 10 percent fee to the
auction house, will give the letters to the Simon Wiesenthal Center
in Los Angeles, according to The New York Times.
   The women had hoped the buyer would put the letters, which are in
English, in a setting where they can be viewed publicly.
   ``We enjoyed them for 48 years, and we're just hoping that maybe
the world will get to see them,'' said Betty Ann Wagner.
   Miss Wagner and her sister Juanita wrote to Anne and her sister,
Margot, in 1940 at the suggestion of a teacher in their
then-hometown of Danville, Iowa. At the time, Anne and Juanita were
11; Margot and Betty Ann were 15.
   Anne and Margot sent back two photographs, a postcard and two
letters describing their life in Amsterdam, Holland. Margot wrote
that ``having a frontier with Germany and being a small country we
never feel safe.''
   The Wagners wrote back, but never heard from the Franks again.
   A month after the letters were sent, Germany invaded the
Netherlands. The Franks, who were Jewish, went into hiding in the
attic of a house in Amsterdam but were later discovered and sent to
concentration camps. Anne's diary, published in 1952, carries a
poignant account of their life in hiding.
   ``We'd worried about her during the war, but never dreamed she
was suffering,'' said Miss Wagner, reached at her home in the Los
Angeles area.
   She added that she and her sister, who also lives in California,
hope to visit the house in Amsterdam where the Franks hid.
   After the war, the Wagners wrote to the Franks again. Anne's
father replied to say that he was the only one in his family to
survive the war.
   Rhonda Barad, director of the Wiesenthal center's eastern region,
said the letters would be exhibited at a new museum in Los Angeles
when it is completed next year.
   ``We wanted the letters,'' said Barad, whose organization is
named for the famed Nazi hunter. ``The focus of the center is to
teach tolerance and that's what Anne Frank's diary and her life
represent.''
   Miss Wagner said she plans to donate part of the money from the
sale to Wayfarer Ministries, a non-profit organization she founded
nine years ago to help Christian missionaries around the world.
   The auction house, Swann Galleries, had predicted that bidding
would exceed $30,000 but could not estimate how high it would go
because nothing written by Anne Frank had ever been auctioned before.
   Among the bidders was actress Whoopi Goldberg, one of hundreds
who participated in the auction by telephone.
   Also sold at the auction were several Marilyn Monroe autographs,
including her certificate of conversion to Judaism, which took place
just before her marriage to playwright Arthur Miller. The
certificate was bought by a private collector for $7,000, said Will
Bennett, a Swann spokesman.
   A handwritten letter of condolence from Emily Dickinson to the
husband of a friend who died was on the auction block as well,
bringing $8,000 from a dealer.
   Seventy-six pages of handwritten notes by Thomas Edison brought
$32,000. Edison compiled the manuscript, which concerns his travels,
jobs and inventions, for use by his official biographers, Bennett
said.
   A collection of correspondence from Greta Garbo was bought by a
collector for $9,500, Bennett said.

   A once-respected defense lawyer committed
``depraved murder'' by beating his illegally adopted 6-year-old
daughter and doing nothing to save her life, a prosecutor said in
the attorney's murder trial.
   Assistant District Attorney Peter Casolaro made the opening
statement Tuesday as Lisa Steinberg's biological mother, Michele
Launders, sobbed in the courtroom's front row.
   The girl's death nearly a year ago drew national attention and
made her a symbol of the plight of abused children.
   ``As Lisa Steinberg lay unconscious, the defendant did absolutely
nothing,'' Casolaro said, adding evidence showed prompt medical care
would have saved the child's life.
   Joel Steinberg's ``failure to act constituted depraved murder,''
Casolaro said.
   Steinberg, 47, is charged with second-degree murder in the death
of the child he took illegally at birth from Ms. Launders, then an
unmarried Long Island teen-ager. He has denied ever hitting Lisa.
   Casolaro said ``graphic and grotesque'' evidence and testimony
would prove Steinberg murdered Lisa, who was found unconscious at
the Steinberg apartment in Greenwich Village early Nov. 2, and died
three days later.
   The first-grader had bruises on her chest, legs, arms and neck,
and head injuries caused by ``blunt-force trauma'' when she arrived
at the hospital, Casolaro told the state jury. Police officers
noticed Steinberg's bleeding knuckles, he said.
   Steinberg's attorney, Ira London, said in his opening that the
evidence would not support a murder charge and called on the jury to
acquit his client.
   ``It will not be proven in this case that Lisa Steinberg was
murdered, nor will it be proven that Lisa was a battered child,''
London said. ``Lisa was neither sullen or withdrawn. She was a
vital, active and engaging child until her death.''
   Steinberg has said Lisa became sick the night of Nov. 1 after
eating and that the bruises on her back and chest resulted from his
efforts to revive her after she fell unconscious.
   No help was called for Lisa until after 6:30 a.m. on Nov. 2,
court records show.
   London on Tuesday attacked Hedda Nussbaum, Steinberg's longtime
live-in companion, who Judge Harold Rothwax called ``the single most
important witness in this case.''
   Ms. Nussbaum has an agreement with the district attorney's office
to testify, although she has told prosecutors she did not see
Steinberg strike Lisa the day she fell unconscious.
   Ms. Nussbaum was charged in Lisa's death, but was never indicted
and the charges will probably be dropped, the district attorney's
office said. After her arrest, she underwent surgery and psychiatric
treatment for injuries allegedly inflicted by Steinberg.
   London called Ms. Nussbaum ``delusional'' and pointed out that
she had spent the last year in a mental hospital.
   ``Undoubtedly, you will hear witnesses refer to Hedda's
self-destructive romance with satanic cults, her sadomasochistic
behavior outside the home and her involvement with pornography,''
London said.
   Casolaro painted Ms. Nussbaum as another victim of Steinberg.
   ``He exploited her weakness of mind and her emotional problems,''
the prosecutor said. ``The defendant beat and broke Miss Nussbaum
until she had become nothing more than his willing servant.''
   One of the trial's first witnesses, paramedic John Filangeri,
testified that Ms. Nussbaum was in such bad shape the night of the
death she appeared to be ``70 to 80 years of age.'' Ms. Nussbaum is
46.
   Police Officer James Botte, the first person to arrive at the
apartment and see the unconscious girl, testified the home was
dirty, unkempt and dark when he arrived.
   A 16-month-old boy, Mitchell, was found in the apartment sitting
in a dirty diaper and tethered to a playpen, authorities have said.
The boy was also illegally adopted, and now lives with his
biological mother.
   The trial is to resume Thursday.

   U.S. Customs released a $14 million Eastern jetliner
after the airline put up a line of credit for a $896,000 fine levied
after 56 pounds of cocaine was found on board.
   The airline said it would appeal the fine, along with $13 million
in fines for drugs discovered on other Eastern aircraft.
   The L-1011 departed Miami International Airport for Los Angeles
on Tuesday night, hours after the plane was released. In addition to
the line of credit, Eastern agreed to increase drug security, said
company spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak.
   Since August, 494 pounds of cocaine has been discovered on four
Eastern planes, including the craft seized Monday after a flight
from Bogota, Colombia.
   Agents discovered the cocaine in an orange nylon U.S. Mail bag,
bearing a luggage tag. Eastern officials said Tuesday that they were
not aware of any arrests related to the seizure.
   ``We provided information about the possible shipment of drugs
and we're being punished for providing the information,'' said
Ceremsak.
   But Customs spokesman Clif Stallings said Tuesday the airline was
not involved in any of the drug investigations.
   ``We have no information from them at all about that seizure or
any of the preceding three in the past two months,'' he said.
   Abraham Azzam, formerly a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
agent, now Eastern's top drug security officer, said the airline is
spending $3 million on security, but drug traffickers will continue
using airliners. ``Certainly cocaine is going to continue to come
out of Colombia,'' he said.
   Azzam estimated the seizure of the 293-seat jet cost the airline
$40,000 to $50,000 a day.
   Avianca Airlines of Colombia stopped cargo flights from Bogota to
Miami four months ago because of millions of dollars in fines it has
been forced to pay in this country as a result of cocaine shipments.

   A U.S. Border Patrol car was mistaken for
a possible drug smuggler by an Army National Guard helicopter that
crashed as it swooped down for a closer look, killing all eight
aboard, officials said.
   The helicopter was taking part in the first mission of Operation
Border Ranger, a joint anti-drug smuggling program of six Southern
California sheriff's departments and the federal goverment along the
U.S.-Mexico border, Imperial County Sheriff's Lt. Kenneth Koon said
Tuesday.
   The program has been suspended temporarily until the crash
investigation is completed by personnel from the Army Safety Center
in Fort Rucker, Ala., and the National Guard Safety Office, said
National Guard Maj. Steve Mensik.
   ``We're not going to stop the program (because of the crash).
We'll proceed as long as the law enforcement agencies want to,'' he
said.
   Monday night's fiery crash occurred when the five lawmen and
three guardsmen aboard the UH-1H helicopter noticed a vehicle with
its lights off parked on a remote access road off Interstate 8,
about 70 miles east of San Diego.
   ``They were in the process of descending to get a closer look at
the suspect vehicle. Apparently, at about 500 feet, they struck a
power line that had been strung between two hilltops,'' Mensik said.
   ``We discovered later that it was a U.S. Border Patrol vehicle
with at least one agent inside. He later offered assistance at the
crash.''
   The Border Patrol agents knew about the program, but had no radio
contact with the agents in the air, Mensik said.
   Dale A. Musegades, chief patrol agent for the El Centro Border
Patrol section, said it's common practice for his agents to park and
dim their car lights while on patrol.
   The car was parked in a canyon that separates the eastbound and
westbound lanes of the freeway, about 30 miles west of El Centro, he
said.
   Koon said the helicopter smashed into the rocky foothills of the
Laguna Mountains and burst into flames after striking the 500,000
kilowatt power line.
   The victims, including five sheriff's deputies from four Southern
California counties, died instantly when the fire broke out,
according to the sheriff's department.
   Ocotillo is 40 miles west of El Centro and less than 10 miles
from the U.S.-Mexican border.

   Chanting anti-government and anti-U.S.
slogans, radical students today threw firebombs and rocks at three
government buildings and a U.S. cultural center, police and news
reports said.
   About 100 students directed their attack on the U.S. Information
Service building in the southern city of Taegu, police and the U.S.
Embassy said. It was the third attack on U.S. offices in two weeks.
   The embassy said in a statement that the assailants threw stones
and firebombs, which did not explode, and dispersed police guarding
the center. The students seized the center's signboard and fled when
police reinforcements arrived and fired tear gas, it said.
   There were no injuries, but windows at the center were broken,
and a USIS car and two other cars in the parking lot were slightly
damaged, the embassy said.
   Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, said assailants also
firebombed a police building near the center, shattering 10 windows.
   The agency said bands of students carrying firebombs and clubs
also attacked a government party building and a government
prosecutors' office in downtown Taegu, smashing windows and
destroying two cars.
   At least one student was injured.
   Yonhap said students were demanding the arrest of former
President Chun Doo-hwan, who is under parliamentary investigation
for alleged corruption.
   The radicals also demand the withdrawal of about 42,000 U.S.
troops stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense pact,
contending the presence of U.S. troops hampers unification of the
Korean peninsula, which has been divided since 1945.
   Police have tightened security around the U.S. Embassy, cultural
centers and other American government facilities because of the
current anti-U.S. campaign, which has been on the rise since the
Olympic Games ended Oct. 2.
   On Oct. 14, students injured 13 policemen and razed a police bus
in a firebomb attack on a U.S. cultural center in the southern city
of Kwangju.
   About 21 students hurled firebombs at a U.S.O. building near
downtown Seoul on Friday, a week after a U.S. soldier and three
Koreans were injured in a group fight involving dozens of American
soldiers and Koreans near U.S. military headquarters in southern
Seoul.

<TEXT>
   Best-selling novelist Cynthia Freeman, who
wrote her first book when she was 50 and went on to write eight
other romances that have been translated into 33 languages, has
died. She was 73.
   The former interior decorator, whose full name was Beatrice
Cynthia Freeman Feinberg, died of cancer Saturday at the University
of California Medical Center.
   Freeman published ``A World Full of Strangers'' in 1975, an
instant best seller about a family of Jewish immigrants in her
hometown of San Francisco.
   Her eight other romance novels, which include ``Fairytales,''
``The Days of Winter,'' ``Portraits,'' ``Come Pour the Wine,'' and
``Seasons of the Heart,'' have sold more than 20 million copies.
   Freeman, who dropped out of school in the sixth grade and was
taught by her immigrant parents, audited classes at the University
of California, Berkeley.
   ``I didn't register but I took every course I wanted and I got a
very liberal education for free,'' she said.
   Freeman married Dr. Herman Feinberg when she was 18. He died in
1982.
   Her most often-quoted saying was, ``I say, `Don't worry about
life after death: worry about life after breakfast.'''
   Survivors include a son, Sheldon Feinberg of Danville and her
father, Albert C. Freeman of Atherton.

<TEXT>
   A man who believed his roommate infected him with
the AIDS virus was sentenced to 28 years in prison for killing the
man.
   Frank Ford, 31, testified at his sentencing hearing that he moved
in with former Air Force Sgt. James L. Wiggins in March with the
sole intent of killing Wiggins after learning he tested positive for
the AIDS virus.
   ``I confronted (Wiggins). I said, `Hey, you gave me the AIDS
virus,' and all he could do was laugh in my face. He laughed in my
face about it,'' Ford said. ``I gave this lady friend that means a
lot to me the AIDS virus, and all he could do was laugh in my face,
like so what?
   ``That's when I decided to kill him.''
   Ford pleaded guilty on Sept. 2 to manslaughter for Wiggins'
bludgeoning death on April 2. He pleaded guilty to first-degree
assault and aggravated motor vehicle theft.
   ``Mr. Ford is probably going to suffer severely and die in the
Department of Corrections,'' Denver District Judge Lynn Hufnagel
said Tuesday. ``That is, I suppose a much worse punishment than this
court could ever impose.
   ``What kind of sentence do you think you should get?'' she asked.
``It doesn't seem to make a lot of difference does it?''
   Ford replied, ``No, it doesn't.''
   Ford and Wiggins met in an adult bookstore in 1986. Ford said he
is not a homosexual, but agreed to have sex with Wiggins for money.
   Their relationship was interrupted when Ford was sent to prison
on a theft conviction. It was there that Ford tested positive for
the AIDS virus.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a fatal disease that
breaks down the body's immune system
   The prosecution had sought a 40-year sentence, citing five
previous felony convictions and the manner in which Ford disposed of
Wiggins' body. Testimony showed Ford stuffed the body into a
footlocker and dumped it into a lake.

<HEAD>Britain To Keep Pints And Miles, But Metric System On Its Way</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WEST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has pledged to keep the pint and the
mile but says that from gills and gallons to feet and fathoms,
virtually all the rest of Britain's traditional weights and measures
system will vanish in the 1990s.
   Detailing the latest draft directive from the European Economic
Community on converting Britain to continental Europe's metric
system, Corporate Affairs Minister Francis Maude said Tuesday that
the government sees no grounds for making unnecessary changes.
   ``We're not going to have to re-measure the cricket pitch,'' he
declared in a statement designed to reassure Britons over the
planned conversion to the metric system.
   Cricket pitches will indeed stay the same length, 22 yards. But
measurements in yards, inches and feet will be phased out by the end
of 1994 and replaced by meters, centimeters and millimeters under
the terms of the draft directive.
   The directive was issued by the Brussels-based executive
commission of the 12-nation EEC, to which Britain belongs.
   Other units from what is known as Britain's imperial system of
weights and measures that will vanish under the terms of the draft
directive include the gill, the fluid ounce, and the fathom.
   A gill is the equivalent of a quarter pint. A fluid ounce is a
measure of capacity containing an avoirdupois ounce of distilled
water at 62 degrees. The fathom (six feet), which is used to measure
ocean depths, is already being phased out by the Royal Navy but its
use will be allowed until 1999.
   Maude said the draft directive was broadly acceptable to the
government. It provides for exemption of the traditional pint for
draught beer and cider in pubs and for milk in returnable bottles,
and for the troy ounce.
   The troy ounce, used to measure gold and other precious metals,
is crucial to London-based bullion trading operations.
   Maude said that to avoid wasting an estimated 1.2 billion
returnable bottles in circulation for drinks other than milk, the
government is seeking arrangements to allow the continued use of
imperial-measure bottles until the end of 1999.
   He said the government is also committed to keeping the mile as a
measure for distance and speed on signposts and speedometers.
   He said the furlong, a distance used in horse racing, would also
stay because it was used only in a sporting context and was
therefore not covered by the draft directive. A furlong is an eighth
of a mile.
   But for trade in fruit, vegetables, meat and other items the
pound and the ounce will be replaced by the kilogram and the gram.
   In 1965, Britain first committed itself to going metric _ the
system devised by the Paris Academy of Sciences in 1791 which is now
in force throughout continental Europe.
   British youngsters learn the metric system at school, many goods
in British supermarkets show both the metric and traditional British
measure side by side, and some business like measuring materials in
dry goods stores is done entirely in the metric system.
   Britain's traditional system stems from its days of empire when
it turned its back of continental Europe and went its own way.
Britain joined the European Economic Community in 1973.
   ``This does not mean that the United Kingdom will suddenly lose
all its imperial traditions but it does mean that over the next five
or six years we will see some changes in the way goods are sold in
the shops,'' Maude said.
   ``In matters which are entirely domestic to the United Kingdom we
see no reason why we cannot continue to use imperial units where
they are customary,'' he added.
   There have been efforts to put the United States on the metric
system for more than a decade, including 1975 legislation. But
progress has been slow. Not everyone is thrilled with the idea,
especially some powerful business lobbying groups.
   Under a law enacted in August, the U.S. government is required to
start doing business with its private suppliers under the metric
system starting in 1992.

   Intense thunderstorms, hail and damaging winds pounded
north-central and northeast Texas today, and snow fell on parts of
the Great Lakes region.
   Wind blew the roof off of a home near Newcastle, Texas, and tore
down tree limbs at Woodson, Texas. Hail as big as softballs fell in
north-central and northeast Texas.
   The thunderstorms extended eastward into southwest Arkansas and
northern Louisiana. Thunderstorms also developed over south-central
Oklahoma.
   Cold westerly winds flowing across the warm waters of lakes
Ontario and Erie produced lake-effect snow along their eastern
shorelines. A snow advisory was posted for the east lakeshore
counties of Ohio, and a lake snow advisory was in effect for New
York counties east of both the lakes.
   Lake-effect snow also fell over parts of upper Michigan, and
light snow dusted southeast lower Michigan.
   A cold front pushing through the Pacific Northwest generated
light rain and fog in parts of Washington state.
   Fog also shrouded the Pacific Coast from Southern California to
Washington. A dense fog advisory was in effect for parts of the
Northern California coast.
   Today's forecast called for continued scattered rain and snow
showers in the Great Lakes region, the upper Ohio Valley and
northern New England; showers and thunderstorms over east Texas and
the lower Mississippi Valley; rain showers over the northern Rockies
and the Pacific Northwest, with rain heaviest over north-central
Montana; and fair to partly sunny skies elsewhere.
   Highs were predicted in the 30s over upper Michigan and northeast
Minnesota; the 40s and 50s from Washington state to northern
Montana, and from the northern Plains and upper Mississippi Valley
to the Great Lakes, the Ohio Valley, and the middle and northern
Atlantic Coast states; the 80s over southern and central Florida and
the southern half of Texas; 80 to 95 degrees in the desert Southwest
and inland valleys of California; and the 60s and 70s elsewhere.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 16
degrees at Grand Forks, N.D., to 78 degrees at Corpus Christi,
Texas, Naval Air Station.

<TEXT>
   A lower-ranking diplomat at Saudi Arabia's
embassy was assassinated on the steps of his apartment building,
Ankara Gov. Saffet Arikan Beduk said today.
   Beduk said Abdulgani Bedawi was shot to death by unknown gunmen
Tuesday night in front of his apartment building in affluent Cankaya
district. Bedawi, who was returning from the office, died instantly
from shots to the head and chest, Beduk said.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
   Saudi Arabian Ambassador Abdulaziz Khojah said the ``killing
could not possibly be a result of personal conflict or for
burglary.'' He said, however, that the embassy had received more
than 100 threatening letters written in Turkish during the spring
holy pilgrimage season.
   ``I don't believe the Turks have anything to do with the incident
even though the letters were in Turkish,'' Khojah said without
elaborating.
   Saudi Arabia restricted the number of Moslems who could visit the
country during the pilgrimage season this year according to each
Moslem nation's population.
   The decision was taken as a security measure after last year's
riot by Iranians during the pilgrimage to Mecca that claimed the
lives of more than 400 Iranians.
   Saudi Arabia broke diplomatic ties with Iran in April. The Saudi
government then announced that the decision had several reasons,
among them the clash in Mecca and a subsequent attack on the Saudi
embassy in Tehran.
   Khojah said Bedawi worked as a telex operator in the embassy. The
envoy confirmed that he was working under diplomatic status, with
the title of second secretary. Bedawi had been appointed to his job
six years ago.

<HEAD>Despite Leaky Gloves, AIDS Infection Unlikely Through Skin Contact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors and nurses face a one-in-a-thousand
risk of catching AIDS when they get infected blood or other body
fluids on their skin, even though gloves they wear for protection
often leak, studies found.
   ``Gloves have been leaking for years, we've been wearing them and
we haven't found a lot of infections in hospital employees'' exposed
to AIDS, hepatitis B and other viruses, said Jane
DeGroot-Kosolcharoen, an infection control nurse at Middleton
Memorial Veterans Hospital in Madison, Wis.
   Three studies conducted by DeGroot-Kosolcharoen and researchers
in Massachusetts and Florida found leakage in more than half of some
of the brands of gloves tested. One study was conducted as an
eighth-grade science project by a student whose father is an
infectious disease expert.
   The studies found wide variations in leakage rates for various
brands of latex and vinyl gloves, but tended to show sterile
surgical gloves less leak-prone than non-sterile examination gloves,
and latex less leak-prone than vinyl.
   A fourth study concluded blood, sputum, urine and other body
fluids of AIDS patients gets on the skin of health care workers
``far too frequently,'' with about one-quarter of a group of 770
hospital employees getting AIDS-tainted liquids on their skin.
   But the chance of one such exposure infecting a person with the
virus for acquired immune deficiency syndrome is no more than 1.1 in
1,000, said Barbara Fahey, an infection control specialist who
performed the study at the National Institutes of Health Clinical
Center in Bethesda, Md.
   A related study by NIH epidemiologist David Henderson found
health care workers face a one in 250 chance of catching AIDS from a
single instance of being jabbed by a contaminated needle, and a one
in 300 chance of being infected if virus-tainted liquid comes in
contact with their mucous membranes.
   ``There really is a risk we all have to swallow. It's a bitter
pill,'' Henderson said Tuesday during the 28th Interscience
Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy.
   However, the NIH studies showed health care workers got
AIDS-tainted fluids on their skin far more often than they contacted
such liquids through their mucous membranes or needle injuries.
   Researchers at the conference said hospital workers should check
gloves for holes before using them, then wash their hands after
removing gloves.
   DeGroot-Kosolcharoen said recommendations for health care workers
to wear gloves to protect themselves from AIDS and other viruses
caused a nationwide glove shortage and that ``manufacturers have had
difficulty supplying enough gloves without compromising quality.''
   She performed water-leak tests on 2,400 gloves from 24 brands of
gloves. In a second test, the gloves were donned by researchers and
dipped in blood they donated.
   Of the 24 brands, only four didn't leak at all. They were sterile
latex gloves. Up to 52 percent of gloves in some brands leaked,
DeGroot-Kosolcharoen said.
   Average leak rates for water and blood, respectively, were 1.1
percent and 1.1 percent for sterile latex, 9 percent and 9.5 percent
for sterile vinyl, 14 percent and 9 percent for non-sterile latex,
and _ most leaky _ 17.7 percent and 10.3 percent for non-sterile
vinyl.
   University of Massachusetts Medical Center infection control
research director Helen Rosen Kotilainen tested 1,200 vinyl and
1,750 latex non-sterile examination gloves from seven brands.
   Water-leak rates for ranged from 4 percent to 28 percent for
vinyl brands and from 0 percent to 6 percent for latex brands.

   President Chadli Benjedid has rejected
transition to a multi-party democracy as part of political reforms
announced after bloody riots earlier this month.
   In a communique issued by his office Monday night, Benjedid said
the ruling party, the National Liberation Front, would become more
democratic and party officials would be made more accountable to the
rank and file.
   The communique said the party had to ``listen more atentively to
the people to understand their concerns''
   The unrest, spurred by Algeria's economic crisis, began with
demonstrators protesting food shortages and rising prices.
   The party, which has ruled the country since independence from
France in 1962, was already unpopular and has been silent since the
disturbances, which left 159 people dead and 154 injured, according
to official figures.
   Unofficial estimates at the time put the number of dead at 400 or
more.
   The communique said, ``a multi-system cannot be established with
groups who seek power and privileges under the facade of democracy.''
   However, the communique said, rejuvenation of the ruling party
does not exclude the possibility that eventually there could be a
pluralistic system.
   It said there will be elections to most party posts and
non-members could run for election to popular assemblies.
   The measures are to be put before a party congress in December
and then to a referendum next year.
   In another referendum next week, Algerians will vote on a plan to
make the prime minister answerable to the National Assembly.

   Lawyers for Ferdinand Marcos cited his ailing
health in asking officials to move the deposed Philippine
president's arraignment on federal racketeering charges from New
York to Honolulu, a Marcos attorney says.
   Marcos and his wife, Imelda, were indicted Friday on charges they
plundered more than $100 million from their homeland to buy real
estate and other properties in New York. They are to be arraigned
Monday in New York.
   John Bartko, Marcos' San Francisco-based attorney, said attorneys
sought the Honolulu arraignment because of the 71-year-old Marcos'
poor health and the simplicity of the proceeding.
   ``Basically, all they are required to do is show up and enter a
plea, which in this case, of course, would be not guilty,'' said
Bartko. ``Considering Mr. Marcos' poor health and the fact that it
would be a very long trip and require numerous medical personnel, we
hope to have the site changed.''
   Marcos has been treated for a variety of illnesses during his
exile in Hawaii, including chest pains and an eye ailment. He and
his wife, Imelda, fled to Honolulu in February 1986 after a
civilian-military revolt ended his 20-year rule.
   Bartko said he hoped to know by Thursday or Friday whether the
change would be granted.
   U.S. officials here said the Marcoses would incur all costs of
the trip and that they did not require federal law enforcement
escorts.

<TEXT>
   A frenzied crowd of teen-agers ran wild at an
autograph party for the Puerto Rican rock group Menudo and tried to
tear clothing, shoes and earrings from their idols.
   Eight people were injured, including two who were hospitalized. A
15-year-old girl was arrested for disorderly conduct. ``She wouldn't
let go of one of the Menudo group members,'' said police Sg. Pete
Velasquez.
   One young Menudo performer said he became so scared during the
melee at Ingram Park Mall that he began crying. Another said he
crawled like a commando beneath the stage to escape the screaming
girls.
   The crowd estimated at 1,500 overwhelmed the mall's 15 security
guards, forcing authorities to call in about 30 police officers to
help quell the disturbance, authorities said.
   None of the six Menudo members was hurt, and the group plans to
go on with a scheduled Thursday night performance in San Antonio, a
group spokesman said.
   Menudo has sparked similar displays of teen affection, which have
been dubbed ``the Latin version of Beatlemania,'' during its
international tours.
   When the girls jumped onto the stage, ``I was super-scared,''
said the group's youngest member, 11-year-old Angelo Garcia. ``The
choreographer thought at first I was laughing, but I had started to
cry.''
   One enthusiastic fan tried to take the boots off another group
member, Ruben Gomez, 15, but he was able to save his footwear after
he fell off the the 4-foot-high stage.
   ``They tried to pull my ear off,'' said Menudo member Rickie
Martin, 15. ``They were trying to get to my earrings.''

   In true Hollywood fashion, the people behind Kink
the dachshund's prize-winning entry in a national canine film
festival are already talking about a sequel.
   ``We'll examine how Kink handles fame,'' said Jodi Carr of Santa
Clara, Calif., who with Steve Channon collected a $20,000 check
Tuesday at Radio City Music Hall for Kink's winning effort.
   The movie, entitled ``Kink's Calypso,'' chronicles the 9-year-old
dog's fantasy visit to Hawaii, where he sips multicolored drinks
with little umbrellas.
   The film festival, sponsored by Come 'N Get It dog food, drew
about 400 entries.
   Other winners included Checkers, a black-and-white mixed breed
who captured best performance by a dog in a video. As Elvis sang,
``I Did It My Way,'' Checkers knocked people down, stole food and
bit mail carriers, among other things.
   Lepky, from the husky-malamute family, won best canine comedy for
taking Fifi, a French poodle, on a drive in a sports car while the
Beach Boys sing, ``Little Deuce Coupe.''

   A candidate for secretary of state said there
would be no more name-calling in his campaign one day after calling
his opponent a ``fairy queen.''
   John Sheppard said his comment about Oregon Secretary of State
Barbara Roberts at a news conference was aimed at her opposition to
a ballot issue but was misunderstood.
   The measure would repeal Gov. Neil Goldschmidt's executive order
barring state agenices from discrimination based on sexual
preference. Repeal supporters say Goldschmidt's order grants
homosexuals special protection, even though it also applies to
heterosexuals.
   Sheppard had called Goldschmidt a ``bozo'' for issuing the order,
and said Monday that if ``Goldschmidt is the chief bozo, Barbara
Roberts can be crowned the fairy queen.''
   On Tuesday, Sheppard promised, ``You won't see any of that
again.''
   Sheppard, a Republican, said the comment was ``not the choice of
words I would have used,'' claiming he was reading from a news
release written by his campaign manager. Sheppard, however, declined
to apologize for the remark.
   Roberts, a Democrat, said Sheppard's comment represented a ``new
low'' in Oregon political campaigns.

   Police and soldiers conducted
body searches on black voters outside Cape Town as South Africans of
all races voted today in segregated municipal elections.
   President P.W. Botha's ruling party was expected to lose ground
to extreme right-wing opponents in white cities, and a light turnout
was reported in black townships where anti-apartheid activists urged
a vote boycott in defiance of the government's state of emergency
regulations.
   State Radio South Africa reported 1,946 candidates for the 7,229
town council seats were elected unopposed. It noted fewer than half
the 1,839 black township council seats were being contested, with no
candidates for 138 seats.
   Black, white, Asian and mixed-race voters cast ballots today,
marking the first time all four major race groups in South Africa
voted on the same day.
   Anti-apartheid activists such as Archbishop Desmond Tutu, winner
of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, called for a national day of protest
today. Such calls usually include a general strike.
   But most black townships appeared normal except for heightened
police patrols and the presence of armed security forces around
polling booths and transportation facilities.
   Police said gasoline bombs were thrown during the night at the
homes of three candidates in Soweto, the country's largest black
township, outside Johannesburg. Also, a limpet mine exploded in a
beer hall in Soweto, but there were no injuries.
   Two black candidates had been killed during the campaign, one
Monday night outside Port Elizabeth, the other in August in Soweto.
   Many schools in Soweto were closed because of poor attendance,
officials said, and black students writing exams in Umlazi outside
Durban were fired on. Buses and trains were stoned in the black
township of Claremont outside Durban.
   Voting was extremely slow in many black areas around Cape Town,
with one or two voters showing up by midday at some polling places.
But poll workers said more than 1,000 voters turned out in
Khayelitsha, where police were seen conducting body searches of
people entering the polling area.
   Critics say black turnout figures this year will be virtually
meaningless because millions of blacks are ineligible to vote and no
candidates linked to major anti-apartheid groups are running.
   Most leading opposition groups are banned, and most activists
view black town councils as subservient extensions of the
white-controlled central government.
   Truckloads of police were posted at the polling booth in Mayfair,
a white suburb of Johannesburg where non-whites have begun living
illegally.
   In Soweto, police with rifles stood around polling booths;
soldiers and police on motorcycles and horses were stationed near
the police station.
   Bombings and hand grenade attacks have averaged more than one a
day in South Africa since September. Police say the attacks are part
of a campaign by the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla
movement to disrupt the elections.
   A car bomb killed three black men and injured 18 on Monday in the
town of Witbank, east of Johannesburg.
   On Tuesday, riot police used tear gas and clubs to disperse more
than 1,000 activists at University of the Witwatersrand in
Johannesburg who were calling for an election boycott.
   There were no injuries in that incident, but about 30 high school
students in Cape Town similarly protesting the elections suffered
slight injuries in a clash Tuesday with club-wielding police, school
officials said.
   The government had sought a high turnout to bolster its claim
that it is ``broadening democracy'' in South Africa.
   In the white elections, Botha's National Party was in a showdown
with the staunchly pro-apartheid Conservative Party. The
Conservatives were predicting they could capture the city council in
Pretoria, the capital.
   The Conservatives, who see Botha's gradual race reforms as
capitulation to the black majority, seek to reimpose strict
segregation throughout South Africa.
   The Conservatives won 26 percent of the vote in the national
elections of May 1987, and claim they could seriously challenge the
National Party in parliamentary elections expected by early 1990.
   In the black elections, less than 500,000 of the country's 26
million blacks were expected to vote despite a massive government
advertising campaign to promote black turnout. About 2.4 million
blacks are registered to vote in municipal elections, but blacks
have no vote in national elections.
   In 1983, when black municipal elections were last held, 21
percent of the registered voters cast ballots, and about the same
expected this time.
   Low turnouts also were expected in Asian and ``colored,'' or
mixed-race, townships. Asians and mixed-race people have their own
houses in the tri-cameral Parliament, as do the whites.
   State-of-emergency regulations in effect since 1986 restrict
reporting about unrest, security force actions, treatment of
detainees, some forms of protest, and a range of statements the
government considers subversive. Enforcement of the regulations has
not been comprehensive.

   The press credentials of three British
journalists were suspended on allegations they violated military
censorship by failing to submit reports about undercover Israeli
army units in the occupied territories.
   Yoram Ettinger, head of the Government Press Office, said the
credentials of Paul Taylor and Steve Weizman of the Reuters news
agency and Andrew Whitley of The Financial Times were suspended
Tuesday pending an investigation.
   Government and army officials will not grant interviews to the
three while their credentials are suspended.
   ``There is an obvious violation of security regulations without
relevance to the authenticity of the information,'' Ettinger told
reporters. Censorship officials said police would investigate.
   Depending on what the police find, they could file charges.
   Under Israeli law, journalists must submit reports relating to
security matters to military censors. The government has not clearly
defined ``security matters'' and leaves submission of reports to the
discretion of correspondents.
   A Reuters story written by Weizman on Sunday said undercover army
units had unusual orders to shoot Palestinians suspected of
organizing violent demonstrations.
   ``We stand by the story,'' said Taylor, 34, the Reuter bureau
chief in Israel.
   Whitley's story of Oct. 11 said undercover troops used Arab cars
and posed as journalists to detain suspected rioters.
   Whitley, 39, said he didn't feel he violated censorship because
he based his report on previously published material. He also noted
he reported on the undercover units in the context of a larger story
about stronger steps taken by the army to quell the Palestinian
uprising, well into its 11th month.
   ``I don't believe I endangered Israel's security by exposing
dirty tricks in the West Bank, but I believe my security is
endangered by these people posing as journalists,'' Whitley told The
Associated Press.
   The army said Monday: ``Units carry out varied operational
activities to preserve security and order, in accordance with the
law. There is no unit in the IDF (Israeli Defense Force, or army)
which is authorized to act, or which acts, against the well-known
rules for opening fire which are grounded in the law.''
   Taylor has worked for Reuters for 11 years. Weizman, 34, who has
dual Israeli-British citizenship, has worked for Reuters in Israel
for 18 months.
   Whitley has worked for the Financial Times for 11 years, the last
three years in Israel.
   Six months ago, the Government Press Office suspended the press
credentials of Martin Fletcher of NBC News and Glenn Frankel of The
Washington Post for not submitting to the censor reports alleging
that Israel carried out the assassination of PLO military commander
Khalil Wazir in his Tunis home April 16. Israeli sources confirmed
the reports, but the government refused comment.
   Both reporters later had their credentials restored.
   The Foreign Press Association protested the latest suspensions.

   Five men were indicted on federal charges they
plotted to import thousands of pounds of cocaine, including a
reputed Colombian drug lord who made death threats against Mayor
Edward I. Koch, officials say.
   The indictment Tuesday of Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha and four others
``reaches into the highest echelon of the multibillion-dollar
Medellin cartel,'' said U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney.
   According to the indictment by a federal grand jury in Brooklyn,
the five conspired with undercover agents posing as drug brokers to
bring 2,200 pounds of cocaine into the New York area every eight
days.
   Robert Stutman, head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration's office here, said his agency received reports from
Colombia that Rodriguez Gacha had made death threats against Koch,
Stutman and other law enforcement officials.
   Three Colombians arrested here Thursday had an electronic device
that could have been used to set off explosives by remote control,
officials said. Informers identified the three as assassins.
   Because of insufficient evidence, one was released and two were
held only on charges of violating immigration law.
   ``If I am not safe, who is?'' said Koch. ``That is what is
horrifying.'' ``The more they threaten, the more we'll go after
them,'' said Stutman, who described Rodriguez Gacha as the most
active member of the cocaine cartel based in the northern Colombian
city of Medellin.
   It is unlikely Rodriguez Gacha will be prosecuted, federal
authorities said, because his South American homeland does not have
an extradition treaty with the United States.
   Another defendant identified as a lieutenant in the cartel, Oscar
Vegas, also lives in Colombia.
   The other three defendants, identified as employees of the
cartel's New York operation, were arrested July 23 when federal
agents seized 1,350 pounds of cocaine near La Guardia Airport, the
first shipment in the sting operation.
   Rodriguez Gacha; Vegas; Jaime Posado, 28, of Queens; Jaime
Pineda, 29, of Queens; and Juan Luis Velez, 26, were charged with
operating a continuing criminal enterprise, conspiracy to import
cocaine and conspiracy to distribute cocaine.
   If convicted, the defendants could be sentenced to life in prison
and fined $6 million each.
   A separate indictment in Miami charged Rodriguez Gacha and six
others with one count of conspiracy to import cocaine.

<TEXT>
   At least 143 people survived the
sinking of a ship during Typhoon Ruby, many swimming for hours
through raging seas to reach safety on small islands, officials said
today.
   Ships and helicopters searched the area today in hopes of finding
hundreds more left missing when the 2,855-ton Dona Marilyn sank
Monday with more than 500 people aboard.
   A shipping executive said survivors struggled onto lifeboats or
jumped overboard as the vessel heaved in the storm-whipped Visayan
Sea. It sank about 300 miles southeast of Manila.
   ``Everybody was jumping into the sea,'' said Bernardo Cabigon,
Tacloban station manager of Sulpicio Lines, which owned the Dona
Marilyn. ``Others took the lifeboats. But there were so many people
that they decided to jump and swim. They looked very tired. They
stayed in the water for three hours.''
   Cabrigon said 120 of the 143 survivors managed to reach the
small, remote island of Almagro with lifejackets and life boats.
   In Cebu, Sulpicio President Carlos Go said 13 other survivors
were found by rescuers on other islands and in the choppy seas.
   There were unconfirmed reports scores of others may have reached
safety on another island.
   ``I'm expecting more survivors. We have not called off
operations,'' Cabigon said.
   President Corazon Aquino ordered an investigation into the
sinking. She also declared a state of calamity in Manila and 35
provinces hardest hit by Typhoon Ruby, which killed at least 103
people elsewhere in the Philippines Monday and Tuesday.
   Last December, another Sulpicio ship, the Dona Paz, collided with
an oil tanker off Mindoro island. Only 28 people survived, and more
than 3,000 were believed to have perished in the world's biggest
peacetime shipping disaster.
   Cabrigon said the bodies of 26 victims washed ashore at Almagro.
The coast guard said another body was found today in nearby waters.
Almagro's mayor, Raul Escalante, said he had buried 18 of the
decomposing victims in a common grave.
   The Dona Marilyn left Manila on Sunday bound for Tacloban but was
buffeted Monday by strong waves and winds of up to 140 mph, Cabigon
said. The coast guard said the skipper reported the vessel listing
in heavy seas in a radioed distress signal before the ship went down.
   Cabigon quoted survivor Alberto Oledo as saying he jumped from
the stricken ship with his wife, son and daughter. The three held
hands but were separated in the raging seas, Cabigon said. Oledo
managed to reach Maripipi but there was no trace of his wife and
children.
   In a second, smaller rescue effort, the U.S. Navy said the USS
Blue Ridge found four crewmen of the 300-foot Philippine freighter
Jet Nann Five, which sank about 150 miles south of where the Marilyn
is believed to have gone down.
   A U.S. Navy spokesman at the Subic Naval Base said the Blue Ridge
was still searching for the vessel's 15 other crewmen. He quoted
survivors as saying the Jet Nann Five capsized 12 hours after
leaving Cebu Sunday for Mindanao.
   The Navy said the four were being treated for second-degree
sunburn, dehydration and mild hypothermia.
   The Philippine National Red Cross and other relief agencies said
103 people were killed on land in the onslaught of the typhoon,
which pummeled the entire archipelago nation with heavy rains and
winds Monday and Tuesday.
   Ruby, now packing 93 mph winds, was reported heading today at 7
mph west-northwest toward China. The Philippine Weather Service said
the typhoon was about 240 miles northwest of Manila.
   The Department of Social Services said 485,000 Filipinos were
``affected'' by Ruby, meaning their homes were destroyed, damaged or
flooded or sustained other losses.
   Among the Ruby's fatalities on land were 26 people who drowned
when a bus plunged into a swollen river on Panay island, the Red
Cross said.
   The Department of Social Services reported 20 people were killed
on Mindoro island, but gave no details. Most deaths during typhoons
in the Philippines are caused by drowning.
   Other deaths were reported on Luzon and Mindanao, and authorities
said they expect the death toll to go up as communications were
restored and more reports came in from rural areas.

<TEXT>
   The turnout in the presidential election is
expected to be one of the lowest this century, continuing a trend of
declining voter participation in a nation that prides itself as a
beacon of Western democracy, say political analysts.
   Public interest groups are warning that only 50 percent or less
of the eligible voters will go to the polls on Nov. 8, about the
same as the record low 49 percent turnout in the 1924 presidential
election.
   The declining turnout, down from a record high 79 percent in
1896, puts the United States at the bottom of the voter
participation list in the world's democratic systems.
   Belgium heads the average voter participation list with 95
percent while the United States ranks last with 53 percent and
Ireland second to last at 62 percent, according to figures compiled
by Frances Fox Piven and Richard Cloward in their book, ``Why
Americans Don't Vote.''
   The turnout in the last election, the 1984 contest between
President Reagan and Democrat Walter F. Mondale, was 53.3 percent of
the voting-age population. That was the lowest turnout since the
51.1 percent who gave Harry Truman an upset victory over Republican
Thomas Dewey in 1948.
   Most political scientists attribute the low American
participation to the requirement that voters register days or weeks
before they cast their ballot. In contrast, registration in West
European democracies is generally automatic, with the voter
receiving a notice in the mail.
   ``In fact, American registration procedures are Byzantine
compared with those that prevail in other democracies,'' said Piven
and Cloward.
   Walter Dean Burnham, an expert on voter participation, says that
without ``the two-step hurdle'' of registration and voting, turnout
would increase 8 to 10 percent. Figures show that 87 percent of
those who do register go to the polls on Election Day.
   Other reasons cited by analysts for low participation include the
declining power of the political party system, the generally
apolitical nature of the electorate and television, which tends to
focus on personalities rather than parties.
   ``As a result, people don't feel very represented and it's not
very important for them to vote,'' said Burnham, a professor of
government at the University of Texas at Austin.
   Political parties in Europe are far more homogeneous than the
Democratic or Republican parties in the United States, making it
easier for voters to take sides and for the parties to target
constituents, said G. Bingham Powell, chairman of the School of
Government at the University of Rochester.
   Many Americans do not identify with either of the two major
parties, said Powell, who studies the difference between the U.S.
and European political systems.
   Scholars also note that among the non-voters about 75 percent are
low-income, less educated Americans who do not feel represented by
the existing system and are generally less likely to vote.
   Others believe the decline in voter participation stems from the
general attitude of many Americans.
   ``Not voting is a reflection of the fact that we're relatively
content with life, sated with our lifestyles,'' said Michael
Robinson, a Georgetown University scholar. ``People don't see any
reason to vote and change this.''
   And many analysts contend that the George Bush-Michael Dukakis
race has focused heavily on negative campaigning, further alienating
voters.
   ``If all you see every night is Dukakis bashing Bush or vice
versa, why would you rush out to vote for them? They don't address
issues, what's the point?'' said Curtis Gans, who heads the
non-partisan Committee for the Study of the American Electorate.
   Other political scientists attribute the drop of voters to the
multi-level system of local elections, gubernatorial and state
legislature elections, congressional elections and the presidential
election.
   ``People are baffled by the system, they don't feel their vote
can make any difference to their children's school or the state of
the local roads,'' Gans said.
   Turnout for local and congressional elections is about 20 to 30
percent lower than for presidential elections.
   ``There's an incredible degree of apoliticality in this country,
compared to Europe,'' said Burnham. ``In fact, people regard the
campaign as just another horse race. It comes along with the
baseball season and football seasons. People participate vicariously
at home, but don't feel they need to go out and join in.''

   Lebanese newspapers today published a
letter from a committee of journalists marking the 41st birthday of
American hostage Terry Anderson.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest-held of the 14 foreign hostages held in
Lebanon. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   The journalist, held by a pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem faction
calling itself Islamic Jihad, or Holy War, turns 41 on Thursday.
   ``Your colleagues in the United States and throughout the world
salute you today on your birthday,'' said the letter published by
seven of Lebanon's 11 Arabic-language daily newspapers.
   Although the letter was sent to the newspapers in English, they
only published a translation of it in Arabic. Anderson is not known
to read Arabic.
   The newspapers also published a photograph of American country
music star Hank Williams Jr. receiving a bracelet from Anderson's
sister, Peggy Say.
   The bracelet carries Anderson's name and the date of his
abduction. Williams signed a birthday card for Anderson, as did
other stars before the Country Music Association Awards show began
in Nashville, Tenn. on Oct. 10.
   The papers that published the letter included Al-Haqiqa, the
mainstream Shiite Amal militia's main daily publication. Amal is
locked in a power struggle with the pro-Iranian fundamentalists who
include Anderson's kidnappers.
   Amal leader Nabih Berri, who also is justice minister in the
predominantly Moslem Cabinet of Lebanon's dual government, has
denounced the kidnapping of foreigners as an ``unforgivable crime.''
   The letter to Anderson said: ``Those of us on the Journalists
Committee to Free Terry Anderson, as well as thousands of others
throughout our profession, pay tribute to you for honoring
throughout your career the highest standards of journalism.
   ``We respect your commitment to truth and fairness in your
coverage of Lebanon, your partisanship towards none, your respect
towards all,'' the letter added.
   ``Yet we also honor you today as a man of dignity and courage in
the dark places of privation. All free men and women who live by the
pen share this morning in your captivity,'' it said.
   ``As you mark your 41st birthday, your fourth in incarceration,
we join our hearts with yours in yearning for your freedom. We greet
you, we salute you and we encourage you,'' the letter said.
   In addition to Anderson, the 13 foreigners missing in Lebanon are
eight Americans, three Britons, an Italian and an Irishman.

   Chanting anti-government and anti-U.S.
slogans, radical students today threw firebombs and rocks at three
government buildings and a U.S. cultural center, police and news
reports said.
   About 100 students directed their attack on the U.S. Information
Service building in the southern city of Taegu, police and the U.S.
Embassy said. It was the third attack on U.S. offices in two weeks.
   The embassy said in a statement that the assailants threw stones
and firebombs, which did not explode, and dispersed police guarding
the center. The students fled when police reinforcements arrived and
fired tear gas, it said.
   There were no injuries, but windows at the center were broken,
and a USIS car and two other cars in the parking lot were damaged,
the embassy said.
   Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, said assailants also
firebombed a police building near the center, shattering 10 windows.
   The agency said bands of students carrying firebombs and clubs
also attacked a government party building and a government
prosecutors' office in downtown Taegu, smashing windows and
destroying two cars.
   Police said 13 students were arrested. One student was
hospitalized after he cut his wrist with a knife and jumped off a
fourth-floor office to a safety net on the ground when police
charged into the prosecutors' building, which had been seized by 10
students, police said.
   Yonhap said students were demanding the arrest of former
President Chun Doo-hwan, who is under parliamentary investigation
for alleged corruption.
   Also today, two cars were burned in southern Seoul when 250
students hurled firebombs in a brief street protest demanding Chun's
arrest.
   The radicals also demand the withdrawal of about 42,000 U.S.
troops stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense pact,
contending the presence of U.S. troops hampers unification of the
Korean peninsula, which has been divided since 1945.
   Police have tightened security around the U.S. Embassy, cultural
centers and other American government facilities because of the
current anti-U.S. campaign, which has been on the rise since the
Olympic Games ended Oct. 2.
   On Oct. 14, students injured 13 policemen and razed a police bus
in a firebomb attack on a U.S. cultural center in the southern city
of Kwangju.
   About 21 students hurled firebombs at a U.S.O. building near
downtown Seoul on Friday, a week after a U.S. soldier and three
Koreans were injured in a group fight involving dozens of American
soldiers and Koreans near U.S. military headquarters in southern
Seoul.

   Two sisters who work in the same factory
will share a $31.5 million lottery jackpot, despite the fact that
neither one selected the six winning numbers.
   Mary Ellen Snipes and Maxine Johnson said the winning numbers
were selected by Miss Snipes' ex-husband, Lewis Snipes, who chose
the numbers from the stub of her last paycheck. He also bought the
10 tickets on behalf of the sisters.
   Snipes, who was at a news conference with the sisters Tuesday,
was asked if he would get any of the money.
   ``That's still in question,'' he said.
   He and his ex-wife were asked if they were going to get married
again.
   ``No way,'' she replied.
   But she did say she remained close to Snipes, thanked him for his
role in her winning _ and said he would get some of the money.
   The women, both assembly line leaders at a Riviera Beach
electronic components company called Solitron Devices, will share
$1,576,743 a year, before taxes, for the next 20 years. The total
prize is the third-largest since the Florida lottery began early
this year.
   ``We always go in together,'' Miss Snipes said.
   The sisters, who live in the southeastern Florida farming
community of Indiantown, took the day off from work to file their
claim.
   Miss Snipes said she plans to keep working and would build a
``dream house'' with her new wealth.
   Mrs. Johnson said she didn't know what she would do with her half
of the money and was unsure whether she would keep her job. But she
said she would keep working at least until Nov. 2, when the first
lottery check is expected to arrive.
   Both women declined to give their ages, but said they were
grandmothers.
   The winning numbers were 3, 11, 14, 15, 27 and 40.

<HEAD>Sources: Poland Would Like Diplomatic Recognition From Vatican</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTOR L. SIMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Polish government is willing to make
concessions to the Roman Catholic Church in hopes of obtaining full
diplomatic recognition from the Holy See, Vatican sources said today.
   At recent talks at the Vatican, the Polish government presented a
revised version of a longstanding proposal that would offer the
church greater freedoms and rights, said the sources. They spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   They said no decisions were made and further negotiations are not
expected before January.
   The sources, familar with the Vatican's Eastern European policy,
said the Polish government for some time has been seeking to
re-establish formal relations, which were broken when the Communists
took power after World War II.
   The government proposal is believed to include legal guarantees
for the church; agreement to allow lay Catholic groups; and promises
to end restrictions on the Catholic press, such as in the supply of
newsprint.
   One source said the proposals weren't contingent on the granting
of full recognition but that it is known the government would
welcome the gesture from the Vatican.
   It is believed that such a move by the Vatican would bolster
Polish leaders in their attempt to deal with internal dissent.
   However, some Vatican officials are skeptical about such a move
at this time. And Polish-born Pope John Paul II has stressed the
need to make such relations ``credible'' in the eyes of the Polish
people and the world.
   Poland's Roman Catholic bishops have long sought a statute for
the church to protect it from the whims of various leaders.
   The church has traditionally played an important role in Poland
and supported the Solidarity labor movement, which was outlawed
after the government declared martial law in December 1981.
   Church representatives have been invited to attend talks with the
government and political opposition. Those talks were agreed to in
August by the government in return for labor leaders ending strikes
across the country.
   The start of the talks have been snagged by government objections
to two delegates proposed by Solidarity.

<TEXT>
   An Aeroperu jetliner carrying 69 people
crashed on an Andean plain in southwestern Peru, killing 12 people.
Officials said more people would have died if the pilot had not
swerved to avoid a hill.
   The state-owned airline said an American and three Europeans were
among those killed Tuesday when the twin-jet Fokker-28, filled to
capacity with 65 passengers and a crew of four, slammed into a flood
plain a minute after takeoff.
   Aeroperu spokesman Freddy Chirinos said 44 people were injured.
One person was unaccounted for, he said.
   Many victims died from burns suffered after the plane split in
three pieces on impact and the tail section burst into flames,
officials said. Wreckage was scattered across a half acre of pasture
and a riverbed.
   The jet had taken off from the Manco Capac Airport in Juliaca,
which is more than 12,000 feet above sea level near Lake Titicaca in
southern Peru.
   Chirinos said at least 19 foreigners, mainly tourists returning
from the lake, were aboard the craft. Flight 771 was en route to
Lima, 540 miles northwest, with a stop in Arequipa.
   Aeroperu identified the foreign dead as Douglas Harris of the
United States, Kurt Lenz of Switzerland and Ervert and Ingeborg
Psiller of France. It gave no hometowns for the victims.
   Survivors and witnesses on the ground said the aircraft lost
altitude seconds into the flight but regained it before crashing
alongside the Cabanillas River, one mile northwest of the airport.
   Transportation Minister Camilo Carrillo told reporters in Juliaca
that pilot Fernando Bellina, who survived, averted greater disaster
by swerving the stricken craft to avoid a hill and crash landing on
flood plain sand, which absorbed some of the impact.
   Congressman Rolando Avila, another survivor, said the aircraft
had flown only about 400 yards after takeoff when an explosion shook
it and the jets cut off.
   ``The pilots apparently tried to level off to land and the plane
scraped the roofs of some adobe homes before falling,'' he said.
   Airline officials would not speculate on what caused the crash.
They said an investigation was under way.
   Cesar Atala, a director of the Pilot's Association of Aeroperu,
said the union might call a strike today to protest airline
maintenance practices. He reiterated the association's charge that
Aeroperu's fleet of 10 jetliners is in poor shape due to a shortage
of spare parts.
   But Johnny Cabrere, an Aeroperu air cargo employee in New York,
said flights were operating today. ``We're operating normally,'' he
said.
   Peru, suffering through a severe economic crisis, is virtually
out of dollar reserves to import spare parts for much of its
industry.
   The last major air accident in Peru occurred Dec. 9 when a
twin-engine Navy Fokker F-27 crashed off Lima's Pacific coast,
killing 44 people, including nearly the entire squad of Peru's
leading soccer team, Alianza Lima.
   Chirinos identified the injured foreigners as Elizabeth Dunning,
Catherine Kanskey, Francois Savoir, Michael Reilly, Bernard Mahoney
and Mark Kranki of the United States; Luana and Rafael Gianinazzi of
Italy; Albert Koyson and Brigitte Kahson of France; Walter Kabin of
Great Britain; Joacy Borge of Brazil; and Esther and Ana Lopez and
Gina Garfias of Spain.
   The U.S. Embassy said it had no information on dead or injured
Americans.

<HEAD>Animator Eric Larson, One Of Disney's `Nine Old Men,' Dead At 83</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARNOLD STAPLETON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eric Larson, who helped bring to life such
classic Walt Disney cartoon characters as ``Pinocchio'' and ``Snow
White and the Seven Dwarfs'' during an animation career spanning 50
years, has died at 83.
   Larson died Tuesday at his home in suburban La Canada-Flintridge
of a blood illness known as myelodystlastic syndrome, said his
brother, Bland Larson.
   For decades, he was one of a closely knit group of artists hired
by Disney himself, who called the animators his ``nine old men.''
   In addition to ``Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,'' which was
Diseny's first full-length animated film, Larson worked on
``Cinderella,'' ``Alice in Wonderland,'' ``Fantasia,'' ``The Three
Caballeros,'' ``Lady and The Tramp,'' ``One Hundred and One
Dalmatians,'' ``The Jungle Book'' and ``Sleeping Beauty.'
   The artist and his wife, who died in 1975, had no children of
their own, but Larson delighted millions of others with such
characters as Figaro, the kitten in ``Pinocchio,'' said another
brother, Peter Larson.
   ``That was his personal favorite,'' Larson said Tuesday. ``He
talked about Figaro a lot.''
   ``The kids and animals he drew, those were his children. And he
spent a lot of time with them,'' his brother said.
   Larson was born in Cleveland, Utah, and graduated from the
University of Utah. He was hired by Disney in 1933 to work on ``Snow
White and the Seven Dwarfs.''
   His final film credit was for ``The Great Mouse Detective'' in
1986.
   In the last few years before his retirement two years ago, Larson
also served as the Disney studio's training director.
   ``You can argue that Disney had better animators, but no one was
more concerned with passing on the legacy than Eric,'' said one of
his students, Andreas Deja, an animator on the hit movie ``Who
Framed Roger Rabbit.''

<HEAD>Philippines Denies Soviet Access To Shipyard Near U.S. Base</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government refused Soviet access
to a shipyard next to Subic Bay Naval Base because of U.S. fears the
Soviets would spy on the American facility, an official said today.
   ``Our policy is not to allow (the Soviets)'' access to the
Philippine Shipyard and Engineering Corp., the government's news
agency quoted Manuel Yan, undersecretary of foreign affairs, as
saying.
   ``They are allowed to repair ships in other shipyards but not
there,'' Yan added.
   He noted that the Philippines had rejected previous Soviet
requests to use the shipyard, which is on Subic Bay, next to the
American facility. Yan did not say when the Soviets last made such a
request.
   U.S. officials in Washington said last week the Soviets had asked
to use the shipyard.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they
were worried Manila might grant the request because the shipyard is
losing money and because of dissatisfaction over recent negotiations
on the lease covering U.S. military bases in the Philippines.
   Last week, the two countries signed an agreement under which the
United States will pay $962 million in military and economic aid for
use of the bases in 1991 and 1992.
   Philippine officials wanted up to $2.3 billion a year for use of
the six bases.

   Atlantic salmon are swimming in the
Shetucket River for the first time in about 150 years.
   State Department of Environmental Protection workers on Tuesday
released some 200 salmon as part of a program aimed at reintroducing
the once-native fish into the Thames River and its tributaries.
   Atlantic salmon were once plentiful in the rivers of southeastern
Connecticut. Power-generation dams along the rivers, first installed
in the mid-1800s, prevented the salmon from swimming to their
spawning grounds.
   The effort to reintroduce the fish, if successful, would be not
only a victory for conservationists, but also a boon for the local
economy as fishermen journey to the region for the chance to catch
the prized fish.
   When Oswego County in New York reintroduced salmon into its
rivers early this decade, tourists pumped an additional $7 million
to $8 million into the economy annually, according to studies.
   Ronald R. Whiteley, president of the Thames River Watershed
Association, said some of the salmon probably will begin migrating
down the Thames on a 6,000-mile trip to the waters of Greenland and
back.
   The earliest the fish would return would be 1990. By then,
Whiteley said, it is hoped a fish ladder at Greeneville Dam will be
completed to allow the fish to continue upstream to natural spawning
grounds in shallow waters.
   However, the restocking effort will not succeed until fish
ladders are installed at two dams farther north. It could take
decades for the river to become a natural habitat again for the
salmon, Whiteley said.
   But Tuesday was a start. The fish were trucked to the banks of
the river, then unloaded by net into large plastic barrels. Workers
carried the barrels to the water's edge and dumped the fish into the
river. The salmon are identified with yellow tags attached to a fin.
   The fish, about two to three pounds apiece, were raised in the
Kensington State Salmon Hatchery in Berlin.

   The Supreme Soviet Presidium, the nation's top
executive body, met today to set the agenda of a parliamentary
session expected to pass the 1989 state budget, the Tass news agency
reported.
   The parliamentary session is scheduled Thursday in the Kremlin.
   In addition to the budget, the 1,500 lawmakers are expected to
approve the state economic and social development plan for next
year, a key document designed to translate Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
reformist ideas into practice.
   In a brief dispatch, Tass said Gorbachev was chairing the meeting
of the Presidium.
   ``Questions linked with the 11th session of the U.S.S.R. Supreme
Soviet, scheduled to open Thursday, are under consideration,'' it
said, without providing details.
   On Oct. 1, a special session of the Supreme Soviet elected
Gorbachev, the general secretary of the Communist Party, to the post
of Presidium chairman, or Soviet head of state.

<HEAD>Palestinians Strike After Misreading Leaflets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Palestinians misread a date on smudged
underground leaflets and went on strike by mistake today in parts of
the occupied territories and Jerusalem.
   Seven Arab youths were reported shot and wounded, meanwhile, in
clashes between stone-throwers and Israeli troops today in the
occupied territories.
   Strikers closed most businesses and schools and paralyzed
transportation in much of the occupied Gaza Strip. Most Gazan Arabs
who work in Israel stayed home, according to Arab reports.
   Some stores in Arab east Jerusalem and parts of Hebron, a city in
the occupied West Bank, also were closed, but transportation was
operating normally in both places.
   In parts of the West Bank, young people who normally enforce
strikes visited merchants on Tuesday to explain that the strike was
supposed to be on Saturday, Oct. 29, not today, Oct. 26. The figures
for nine and six look similar in Arabic writing, and smudged
printing on some of the leaflets caused the confusion.
   The leaflets were issued by the United National Leadership of the
Uprising, which regularly orders strikes as a tactic in the revolt
against Israeli rule of the territories captured in the 1967 Middle
East war.
   At least 303 Palestinians and six Israelis have been killed
during the uprising, which began Dec. 8. More than 7,000
Palestinians have been wounded, according to the Israeli government.
   In Nablus, the West Bank's largest city, three Palestinian
teen-agers were shot today in three separate stone-throwing
confrontations, hospital officials said. A 20-year-old man also was
admitted to a hospital after he was shot during a clash in the
Tulkarem refugee camp, the officials said.
   In the Gaza Strip, two 15-year-old boys were shot with plastic
bullets in separate clashes with soldiers in the Sabra neighborhood
of Gaza City and in the Jabaliya refugee camp, Arab reporters and
hospital officials said. Israeli troops have begun using the plastic
bullets because they are less apt to kill.
   An 18-year-old man was wounded in the leg with a plastic bullet
when troops opened fire in Rafah, hospital officials said.
   The Israeli army said it could not confirm the reports of
shootings.
   Also today, the army imposed curfews on seven Gaza refugee camps
and a neighborhood of Gaza City. Troops wrecked five Palestinian
houses in the Gaza towns of Khan Yunis and Rafah as part of their
effort to put down the revolt.

<TEXT>
   The Cabinet of one of the country's
six republics resigned during a debate over its crackdown on an
anti-government protest, news media reported today.
   The resignation in the southern republic of Montenegro came
Tuesday after the republic's Parliament opened debate on whether its
government and presidency overstepped authority in using police to
put down the demonstation earlier this month, the reports said.
   The Montenegrin government said it was stepping down after five
of its 20 members, including Interior Minister Lazar Djodjic, lost a
vote of confidence during the parliamentary session, the Belgrade
daily newspaper Politika said today.
   The government decided to submit its collective resignation
because it ``could not operate in the complex situation'' in which
five ministers lost the vote, Politika quoted Premier Vuko
Vukadinovic as saying. The nine-man presidency, however, won a vote
of confidence Tuesday.
   The Parliament, after its 12-hour session late Tuesday, postponed
consideration of whether to accept the government's resignation and
reconvened today, Belgrade news media reported.
   At least 10 people were injured and 12 arrested earlier this
month in Titograd, the capital of Montenegro, when police used tear
gas to disperse demonstrators protesting falling living standards.
   Yugoslavia is suffering its worst economic crisis with 217
percent annual inflation, 15 percent unemployment and steadily
declining living standards.
   The Titograd demonstrators were also demanding an end to what
they view as persecution of the minority Slav population by ethnic
Albanians in the neighboring province of Kosovo.
   The economic and ethnic issues have combined to give rise to
unrest and calls for an overhaul of Communist Party leadership
across Yugoslavia in recent months. Leaders in Vojvodina, the
nation's other province, were forced out earlier this month. Both
Kosovo and Vojvodina, though nominally autonomous, are partly
controlled by the republic of Serbia.
   The decentralized system of government and a collective federal
presidency were devised in the late President Josip Broz Tito's 1974
constitution to prevent one republic from gaining sway over the
others, but it has resulted in an ineffective government by
compromise.
   In recent months, Serbia began to work on plans to amend its
constitution to strengthen control over Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians make up nearly 90 percent of the population.

   A magistrate today delayed the hearing of
the captain of an Italian freighter accused of manslaughter in the
collision of his vessel with a Greek cruise ship carrying 486
British tourists.
   The hearing before an investigating magistrate was set for next
Tuesday.
   Capt. Flavio Caminale, 45, of Genoa, Italy, made the request
during a hearing at a Piraeus court, citing problems with
translating statements by witnesses from Greek into Italian.
   ``I'm innocent, but we must have more time to prepare everything
that's needed,'' Caminale said. ``It's a question of translation.''
   Investigating Magistrate Telemachus Flesouras granted the
request, but ruled Caminale must remain in detention.
   Two Greek sailors died, and a 14-year-old British girl and a
teacher are missing after Friday's collision between the 6,300-ton
cruise ship Jupiter and and the 5,500-ton freighter Adige outside
Piraeus harbor.
   Caminale was arrested after the collision.
   He faces charges of manslaughter through negligence, causing
serious injuries, causing a shipwreck and ignoring shipping
regulations.
   If convicted, he could be jailed up to five years.
   Caminale maintains his ship was at a standstill when the Jupiter
headed directly for his ship. He said the Jupiter swung around to
avoid a collision but struck the Adige.
   Greek officials say the Adige was approaching the Jupiter and was
unable to reverse in time. The Adige, which suffered minor damage,
was impounded during an official inquiry.

<HEAD>Detectives Investigating Three Deaths With Possible Cocaine Link</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Homicide detectives are investigating the deaths
of three people who died after injecting possibly contaminated
cocaine that they had all bought in the same place, authorities said.
   In addition, officials are trying to determine whether the death
of a fourth man, and the illness of a fifth, are linked to the
others.
   ``All five knew each other and two of them said they all bought
cocaine at the same place (on the Houston waterfront),'' said Roger
Whidmeyer, spokesman for Ben Taub Hospital.
   He said ``a very educated guess'' is that the cocaine was heavily
laced with boric acid, adding, ``There's some coke out there that's
playing Russian roulette.''
   Cocaine sometimes is cut with other substances so dealers can
sell more of the illegal drug.
   Boric acid is a white cystalline compound and is used as a mild
antiseptic, to manufacture cements and enamels, and to kill roaches.
Experts say it also can cause cardiovascular shock.
   Those who died apparently had injected the drug, and two of them
told doctors they thought they had gotten ``some bad cocaine,''
Whidmeyer said. They complained of tremendous dehydration, heart
palpitations and nausea.
   ``They were scared,'' he said.
   Two of those taken to Ben Taub died Monday and the third died
during the night _ all unofficially from cardiac arrest and renal
failure, Whidmeyer said. The fourth person died Monday at another
hospital.
   Autopsies were being performed on the four victims, and the fifth
man was in stable condition late Tuesday at Ben Taub, he said.

   A bomb planted in a horse-drawn taxi
exploded today in a crowded market of Pakistan's second largest
city. Police said 16 people were injured, four critically.
   The mid-afternoon blast sent screaming shoppers running in panic
as a cloud of smoke hung over the market on a road that rings this
ancient walled city, witnesses said.
   Police said the blast was caused by a plastic, timed device
hidden in a wooden box in the horse cart. The taxi driver was among
those critically injured.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
   Pakistan has over the past two years suffered scores of terrorist
bombings, which authorities have usually blamed on agents of
neighboring Afghanistan's Marxist government. Pakistan supports
Afghanistan's anti-government guerrillas.

   Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iran's parliament
speaker and acting military commander-in-chief, today appointed the
former head of the Revolutionary Guards as his military adviser.
   Tehran Radio, monitored in Nicosia, said the appointment of
Mohsen Rafiq-Doust came in a letter to him from Rafsanjani.
   It quoted the letter as saying Rafiq-Doust would advise
Rafsanjani on ``military and logistic industry affairs and matters
pertaining to the organization of the combatants.''
   Rafiq-Doust was appointed in November 1982 as Minister of the
Revolutionary Guards, who comprise elite fighters devoted to Iran's
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   He was dismissed in September after a no-confidence vote at the
Majlis, Iran's parliament.
   Rafiq-Doust had been blamed by several parliament members for a
series of battlefield defeats in the war with Iraq earlier this
year. Iran accepted a U.N. cease-fire in the 8-year-old war in July.
   The truce began Aug. 20.
   A staunch supporter of Khomeini, Rafiq-Doust had organized
security for the revolutionary leader's return home from exile in
February 1979 to overthrow Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.

   Sweden has refused asylum for 10 Soviet
defectors and ordered them back to their homeland, saying they no
longer qualify as political refugees because of Soviet reforms, an
official said today.
   An Immigration Board official, Mikael Broman, said each case was
appealed and is under review.
   In the past, Swedish authorities routinely granted Soviet
defectors the right to stay in Sweden. But Broman said the board
``changed its position due to the developments in the Soviet Union.''
   He was referring to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
campaigns for glasnost and perestroika, or openness and
restructuring.
   The official said the board, relying on assessments from the
Swedish Embassy in Moscow and other Soviet sources, ruled the
defectors did not risk danger if they returned.
   Broman cited cases of defectors who returned to the Soviet Union
for visits without incident.
   ``We have established one case where the person has been back
five times ... Then you are not a refugee in the legal sense,''
Broman said.

Episode</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 400 chanting protesters forced
producers to stop filming an episode of a television show that
features the revenge killing of a bisexual man who spreads the AIDS
virus.
   The protesters Tuesday night appeared to disobey a temporary
restraining order obtained by the producers of ``Midnight Caller''
that ordered them to stay at least 100 feet from filming and to
remain silent.
   Instead, protesters shouted slogans such as ``Act up, fight back,
fight AIDS,'' and engaged in an hourlong faceoff with about 50
police officers until filming was called off at 8 p.m.
   AIDS Foundation spokesman Rene Durazzo said protesters do not
object to an episode about the AIDS epidemic, but ``want an accurate
portrayal of the AIDS crisis'' not an episode they fear will
``promote irrational fear and ignorance.''
   Protesters say the show could incite violence against AIDS
victims.
   The show, which has been filming here for several weeks, features
a detective who becomes a radio talk show host. The controversial
episode concerns a man with AIDS who continues to have unsafe sex
until a former lover kills him.
   The producers said they already have made plot changes to show
they do not condone the murder. At first, the hero helped the lover
escape. But in the revised version, she is arrested.
   Protesters want the murder deleted from the plot.

<TEXT>
   A defense lawyer for confessed TWA
hijacker Mohammed Ali Hamadi said today he has asked a court to halt
Hamadi's trial until evidence in the United States can be checked.
   ``We have asked that no new witnesses be heard until we can see
all evidence on Hamadi held by the United States,'' said attorney
Hans-Burkhardt Steck, who is defending Hamadi against air piracy and
murder charges.
   Steck said in an interview he has ``also asked the court to hire
an American defense attorney, at the court's expense, to view the
material.''
   ``The FBI has said it has tons of material,'' related to the
case, Steck said, referring to earlier court testimony by FBI agent
Gary Noesner.
   Frankfurt's Abendpost newspaper reported today the chief trial
judge, Heiner Mueckenberger, turned over the defense request to U.S.
officials. The newspaper quoted the judge as saying: ``It is a
legitimate request for the defense to view evidence.'' Hamadi's
trial began July 5.
   Mueckenberger could not be reached for comment on the report.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, has admitted taking part in the
hijacking of the TWA jetliner on June 14, 1985, but he denied
killing U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem after the Athens-to-Rome
flight was diverted to Beirut. Stethem was the only fatality during
the hijacking, in which 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days.
   Noesner testified he is convinced the FBI provided the Frankfurt
court all U.S.-obtained evidence relevant to Hamadi's trial. He also
invited Hamadi's defense lawyers to prepare a list of evidence they
felt could be missing and promised: ``I'll do all I can to see that
you get it.''
   The material gathered by the FBI includes news media video films
and tape recordings, some of which had been subpoened by a federal
grand jury in Washington, said Noesner.
   He said the FBI accumulated voluminous amounts of material on the
hijacking case, ``some of which applies to other ongoing
investigations,'' which Noesner said he was not authorized to turn
over to the Frankfurt court.
   In addition to Hamadi, three other men _ identified by U.S.
Justice Department sources in Washington as Hassan Ezzeddine, Ali
Atwa, and Imad Mughniyan _ are sought in connection with the
hijacking.

   Sen. Dan Quayle declared today that Republican
George Bush has virtually claimed an election victory in Florida,
and urged Sunshine State voters to underscore their support by
helping the GOP regain control of the Senate.
   Quayle, who is Bush's vice presidential running mate, asked
Florida voters to give Bush ``a partner in the U.S. Senate'' by
electing Republican Rep. Connie Mack III, who is locked in a close
race with Democratic Rep. Buddy MacKay to succeed retiring Sen.
Lawton Chiles, a Democrat.
   ``I know that Florida is going to vote for George Bush on Nov.
8,'' Quayle told a fund-raising breakfast for Mack in a state
considered safe for Republicans in the presidential contest.
   He said he had talked to Bush on Sunday, and the vice president
told him, ``Would you please give one message to not only Connie
Mack but the entire state of Florida, and that is George Bush needs
Connie Mack in the U.S. Senate.''
   Even though the Republicans are given little, if any, chance of
capturing Senate control, Quayle noted the president's difficulties
in dealing with a Congress dominated by the opposition party.
   ``When you're in the minority, the majority controls the gavel.
They're able to set the agenda in Congress,'' he said.
   It was the first time that Quayle had diverted his campaign
schedule to lend his support in a Senate race. But he also took the
occasion to take another swipe at Bush's presidential rival,
Democrat Michael Dukakis.
   Quayle said Dukakis' statement at the Democratic convention that
the 1988 election is about competence rather than ideology marked
``a closing chapter in liberalism in this country.''
   ``They said right up front, folks, we don't want to talk about
it,'' the Indiana senator said. ``They don't want to talk about
their ideas.''
   After the fund-raiser, Quayle toured a Honeywell plant where
components for the space shuttle and Trident missile systems are
manufactured.
   In Stone Mountain, Ga., on Monday, Quayle said Dukakis is
actively encouraging his campaign surrogates to dish out ``political
sludge'' against the GOP ticket.
   Quayle also was campaigning in Miami's Little Havana Cuban
community and Fort Lauderdale before heading to North Carolina, and
later in the week to New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania.
   In response to a new CBS News-New York Times poll that showed
Bush with a 13-point lead over Dukakis, Quayle said, ``The race is
not over. It's a good sign. It's a positive development. Who knows
what will happen in these last two weeks.''
   The vice presidential candidate also said: ``We are confident we
are going to win, but we're not overconfident.''
   Quayle was answering abortion questions again on Tuesday in his
plane to Tampa, Fla.
   The Indiana senator was asked about a comment the previous day in
which he said that he hoped if his wife were raped and became
pregnant, she would elect to have the baby and not have the abortion.
   Asked if that wasn't a pro-choice stance, he said: ``It's her
choice, I told her what I would like but it's her choice. I can't
tell my wife what to do in that situation.''
   ``She would have that choice'' under the law as it is now
written, he said.
   He added that he does not, however, support that law and favors
allowing each state to determine its own guidelines on abortion.
   In another interview, Quayle told a persistent young reporter
from a children's news program he would rather she had a baby than
abort the fetus if she became pregnant through her father.
   ``That's a difficult question and one that does not have an easy
answer, but my answer would be yes,'' Quayle told an 11-year-old
reporter for ``Chidren's Express'' during a bus tour of Illinois
last week.
   The question-and-answer session was broadcast Tuesday on the CBS
Evening News. The children's show is broadcast on public television.

   The Tass news agency said today the Soviet space
shuttle will blast off on its maiden flight Saturday morning, making
an unmanned trip into space designed to break the U.S. monopoly on
reusable spacecraft.
   ``The Energia system is to blast off at 6:23 (a.m.) Moscow time
on Oct. 29,'' Tass said in its brief dispatch.
   Tass said final checks were being made on systems aboard the
orbiter, named the ``Buran'' (Snowstorm), and the Energia booster
rocket that will carry it into orbit.
   The shuttle is also being prepared for fueling, Tass said.
   The delta-winged Soviet shuttle, which looks like its older
American cousin, has been in the development stages for years, and
space officials here had long promised a launch this year. But they
also acknowledged that technical difficulties caused delays.
   The Soviets also have cited the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion of the
U.S. shuttle Challenger as a reason for caution. Seven astronauts
died when the Challenger blew up.
   In previous reports, Tass has said the Soviet shuttle will be
launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on the Central Asian steppes
in Kazakhstan.

the nation.
   Oct. 23
   The Wenatchee (Wash.) World on child care:
   A heretofore groggy corporate America is finally waking up to the
depth and breadth of the child care issue. That's because valuable
employees (many of them women) are increasingly weighing child care
options as they decide where to work. ...
   The issue is getting its first serious governmental attention as
the reality sinks in that more and more households are inevitably
going to be two-worker situations. Recognition of that fact at the
private corporate level is no doubt helping to spur government
interest.
   Just one thing: While all these efforts to create better
situations for children (and parents) are laudable, we need to keep
in mind that families who decide to have one parent stay home to
raise the kids themselves (and thereby sacrifice that second income)
ought not to be penalized in any way by tax write-offs or tax
increases which are not equitably applied.

   The Oak Ridger, Oak Ridge, Tenn., on the Department of Veterans
Affairs:
   Ronald Reagan campaigned in 1980 on a theme of getting big
government off the backs of the American people. Part of that
campaign included proposals to abolish the two newest Cabinet
departments, Energy and Education.
   Those plans have long since been dropped and the departments are
flourishing bureaucracies.
   The Senate recently gave final approval of a new Department of
Veterans Affairs, in effect elevating the Veterans Administration to
Cabinet status.
   Each time a Cabinet department is added it means new, and often
duplicated, expense. And with the new status, the departments begin
to grow far beyond their previous bounds.
   Of course, in an election year it's not likely that anybody would
oppose creation of a Department of Veterans Affairs. That might
smack of being anti-veteran.
   What we are likely to see is a new tangle of rules and
regulations as the bureaucrats carve out their niches in the new
department.
   And veterans, like non-veterans, will help foot the bill through
taxes.

Halloween was ... the work of Satan.
   That same First Amendment that bans the teacher from advocating

not express it in the classroom where she might influence children

   Portland (Maine) Press Herald on banning plastic firearms:
   No one is manufacturing all-plastic firearms _ yet. But the
technology is available and it's only a matter of time.
   Given that prospect, Congress acted prudently last week in
approving a ban on firearms capable of evading detection by metal
detectors or X-ray machines.
   The measure is a necessity. It bans the manufacture, importation,
sale, shipment or possession of any firearm containing less than 3.7
ounces of stainless steel, exclusive of parts and magazines.
   Without this sort of legislation it would be possible for
terrorists and other criminals to smuggle concealed weapons through
detection devices at airports or courtrooms.
   With it, the job of law enforcement officials is enhanced. ...
   The measure is a sensible one. Far better to confront the problem
now, before undetectable plastic firearms are on the market and on
the street.

   Los Angeles Times on the presidential campaign:
   If the opinion polls are right, neither George Bush nor Michael
S. Dukakis has come remotely close to inspiring any appreciable
number of his fellow citizens. ...
   Some of that is due to the two relatively colorless
personalities. A lot more has to do with the deplorable and even
contemptible quality of their campaigns.
   This has been without doubt the nastiest and most cynical contest
for the White House in recent memory, and _ worse _ the most devoid
of substance. ...
   The cynicism behind these negative strategies derives from the
obvious calculation that voters will be swayed by misrepresentations
and lies because they are too stupid or uncaring to know any better.
...
   Probably no campaign in the 20th Century ... has done less to
illuminate the likely decisions that the next president will be
forced to make. ...
   We don't know who the winner will be on Nov. 8. It's clear
already that the American people are the losers.

   The Phoenix Gazette on U.S. supporters of Israel:
   The scalps of senators and congressmen who defied its wishes hang
from the belt of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee
(AIPAC). It is that powerful.
   The Washington-based Israeli lobby does not always get what it
wants, but it gets it frequently enough to prompt Jeffrey Record, a
senior research fellow at the Hudson Institute, to remark that AIPAC
knows no Israeli act for which there is not an exculpatory
explanation or mitigating excuse.
   ``The prevailing view at the committee's headquarters,'' he said,
``seems to be that all Americans, Jews and gentiles alike, should
keep still and simply fork over whatever amount of military and
economic assistance Israel demands. To express an opinion critical
of how Israel uses its virtually blank checks from the United States
is to commit the unpardonable sin of meddling in the internal
affairs of a sovereign state.''
   Albeit slowly, friends of Israel who do not share AIPAC's myopic
passion are waking to the fact that the lobby does not always speak
for all American Jews.

   We doubt if a more aggressive tax collection policy alone will
solve the federal government's deficit problems. Sterner measures
may be required.
   But it would clearly be a step in the right direction.

   The Daily Oklahoman, Oklahoma City, on the stock market crash
anniversary:
   A year after the worst stock market crash in U.S. history, the
nation is prosperous and most of its citizens are living well.
   A Media General-Associated Press poll finds that while Americans
are wary of Wall Street, they are optimistic about the economy and
their personal finances.
   A look at what has transpired since Oct. 19, 1987, helps explain
the upbeat mood.
   The stock plunge of 508 points did not spark a recession, as some
had feared. Instead, the country's longest period of peacetime
growth stretched into its 71st month. ...
   This is a time when both consumers and producers can appreciate
the resilience of the economy.
   It is also a good time to remember that protectionist trade
policies and tax increases were blamed for the Great Depression of
the 1930s _ a mistake that must not be repeated.

   Sherman (Texas) Democrat on Nancy Reagan's borrowed clothes:
   Good grief, another Nancy flap. In a feat of journalistic
enterprise, Time magazine collected 300 photographs of the first
lady wearing clothes ... and learned that she's been borrowing glad
rags from couturier friends for years.
   And she failed to report this nefarious activity on her White
House financial-disclosure forms since 1982.
   When judging a so-called Crime of the Century it's wise to ask:
Who got hurt? In Nancy's clothing caper, nobody. ...
   By now the first lady should know that she can't please the catty
correspondents on the Nancy Watch.
   If she bought the clothes she wears, they'd call her extravagant.
If she bought a few dresses and wore them often, they'd declare her
a frump. Because she borrowed, they imply she's a crook.
   She ought to invite them in and serve unsweetened lemonade.

   The Greenville (S.C.) News on racism and the presidential race:
   Gov. Michael Dukakis, lagging in the presidential campaign polls,
has brought Jesse Jackson back into the limelight to say ... Vice
President George Bush has been using ``race conscious'' tactics to
create an unfavorable opinion of Dukakis among white voters.
   It is widely agreed that Dukakis sent Jackson practically
underground after the Democratic nominating convention because
Jackson had become a racially divisive personality whose further
rhetorical exertions could not increase the vote already assured the
Dukakis-Bentsen ticket, but probably would drive undecided voters to
the Bush-Quayle ticket. ...
   The point of Jackson's re-emergence isn't racial fairness. It's
to rekindle lagging interest of his own supporters for ... Dukakis.
And what better way than to accuse the Bush campaign of racism?

   The Albuquerque (N.M.) Tribune on approving new drugs:
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has taken an overdue step
to make new drugs available more quickly to people with
life-threatening diseases.
   The federal agency said it will short-circuit the lengthy drug
approval process in order to get promising new medications faster to
patients suffering such deadly illnesses as AIDS and cancer.
   This could shorten by several years the period between the time a
potentially beneficial drug is discovered and the time it is made
generally available to patients.
   The move is welcome news for many people whose lives are hanging
in the balance.

   The Gadsden (Ala.) Times on civil rights protection:
   Congress enacts the laws that the rest of us must live by, but
Congress itself sometimes is exempt from these laws.
   A case in point is civil rights protection. Employers everywhere
are prohibited from discriminating against their employees on
grounds of race, religion, age or gender.
   But not Congress. Congressional employees have no such
protection. ...
   But cannot Congress give its employees somewhat the same
protection all other employees have short of bringing them under the
civil rights acts? Yes, and to its credit the House is now moving to
do just that.
   The House is creating a special office to handle complaints of
this nature. The arrangement calls for mediation and remedies, with
a separate panel designated to handle appeals from either side.
   If handled properly this plan will provide adequate protection
for House employees. The Senate unfortunately has shown no
indication that it will follow the House's lead.
   Public pressure in time, however, could change that.

   Charleston (W.Va.) Daily Mail on PAC money:
   Don't hold your breath waiting for Congress to clean up its
political action committees. At last count 228 representatives and
49 senators ... had PACs of their own.
   These personal PACs are built from campaign contributions, then
passed out to colleagues. That's how power is built these days.
   Two years ago, Jim Wright passed out a whopping $387,000 through
his PAC. Small wonder he became House speaker. He was surpassed by
Tony Coelho of California, who passed out $567,000 on his way to
becoming House majority whip. ...
   In the 1985-86 re-election cycle, Rep. Charles Rangel of New York
made a donation to Rep. Thomas Luken of Ohio, who donated it to Rep.
Bill Richardson of New Mexico, who donated it to then-Rep. Harry
Reid of Nevada, who donated it to Rep. Frank McCloskey of Indiana,
who donated it to candidate Thomas Ward of Indiana. Ward spent the
money and lost his race.
   Maybe it's time that the people who gave money to Rangel, only to
see it end up in the hands of Ward, smarten up and demand a new
system of campaign finance.

   With the president's signature fresh on a new trade bill, a lot

   That's not so, and the next president of the United States had
better be prepared to face up to economic realities come January.
   The trade deficit is still running out of control despite a few
months of showing improved statistics. The Economic Policy Institute
reported this month that the failure of the United States to close
its huge trade deficit cost the country as many as 5.1 million jobs
last year. ...

   Indianapolis Star on media treatment of Sen. Dan Quayle:
   There are those who would suggest that the news media have been
unfair to Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, the Republican vice
presidential candidate. But the significant point is that the latest
person to say it is Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
   The coverage ``has not been a fair characterization of him,''
Kennedy said in a speech at the Associated Press Managing Editors
convention in Boston last week.
   ``Most of his colleagues would say he does a lot better in
give-and-take in the Senate,'' said Kennedy. ``I've worked with him,
and he does a better job on the (Senate) floor.'' ...
   Kennedy said that in the 1988 presidential campaign the media and
politics are dangerously intertwined, a point with which few
open-minded people would disagree.
   Kennedy deserves high credit for doing what he can to set the
record straight about Sen. Quayle.

<TEXT>
   Israeli warplanes today attacked
Palestinian guerrilla bases in southern and central Lebanon. Police
said at least six people were killed and 40 injured near Sidon.
   Nine more people were missing and feared dead in the rubble of at
least 30 buildings destroyed near the southern port city of Sidon,
police said.
   The Israeli air raids were the third and fourth on Lebanon since
a suicide car bomber killed eight Israeli soldiers a week ago.
   Also today, Israeli gunners and allied militiamen fired mortars
and howitzers at leftist Lebanese factions allied with the
Palestinians in and around the southeastern town of Mashgara, police
said. A PLO spokesman said Israeli troops were preparing for a major
ground assault in southern Lebanon.
   Those killed near Sidon included Col. Mustafa Daoud, commander of
a 1,000-man militia attached to the Fatah guerrilla faction of the
PLO.
   The wounded included Col. Mohsen Hallak, commander of the
Palestine Liberation Organization's 1,000-strong Beit al-Maqdes
batallion and officers of Force 17, the PLO's security apparatus,
police said.
   Reporters saw 20 people lying on the ground, apparently dead or
wounded.
   Four fighter-bombers thundered in from the Mediterranean sky west
of Sidon at 11 a.m., a police officer said, to stage ``one of
Israel's heaviest air assaults, if not the heaviest, this year.''
   They fired 12 rockets into the refugee camp of Mieh Mieh and the
nearby Ein el-Dilb hill on Sidon's southeastern outskirts in three
sorties spaced over eight minutes, police reported.
   At 2:30 p.m., Israeli warplanes attacked pro-Syrian Palestinian
guerrilla bases just south of Beirut in suburban Khalde and Aramoun
and in hills above the coastal towns of Damour and Naameh, police
said. Damour and Naameh are located midway on the coastal highway
between Beirut and Sidon.
   Casualty reports from those attacks were not immediately
available.
   Syrian anti-craft batteries near Beirut airport and Aramoun
opened up at the Israeli planes, but no hits were claimed, police
said.
   Describing the damage near Sidon, a police spokesman said, ``At
least 30 buildings within a radius of 150 yards in Mieh Mieh's
central square were pulverized. Many victims, ``including a family
of six members, are still buried in the rubble,'' said the
spokesman, who demanded anonymity.
   ``It's a massacre,'' said Abu Yasser, the Palestine Liberation
Organiztaion military commander of the Sidon region who uses only
his nom-de-guerre. ``Plenty of people are buried in the debris.''
   ``It was so swift that we couldn't look up at the sky to fire
back at the planes,'' said a guerrilla who identified himself only
as Abu Khaled.
   ``We were stunned, motionless. No one even dared to go to the
rescue until a half-hour after the raid ended,'' he said.
   Targets belonging to PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's mainstream
Fatah guerrilla group in Mieh Mieh and Ein el-Dilb took the brunt of
the attack. Most of them were one-story houses, police said.
   Two command posts of the Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation
of Palestine and the Moscow-oriented Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine also were flattened, police said. Israeli
said the targets had been used as bases for launching attacks
against Israel.
   In Israel, the military command confirmed the raids on the Sidon
area, the hills above Damour and the bluffs just above Beirut,
saying the jets scored accurate hits and returned safely to base.
   Israeli gunners and allied militiamen of the South Lebanon Army
today fired mortars and howitzers at leftist Lebanese factions
allied with the Palestinians in and around the southeastern town of
Mashgara, police said.
   They said the shelling could precede a ground thrust by the
Israeli army and the SLA north of Israel's self-designated security
zone in south Lebanon. Pro-Syrian leftists guerrillas are entrenched
in the Mashgara region.
   In Baghdad, Bassam Abu Sharif, spokesman for Arafat, said Israeli
troops were massing inside the six-to-10 mile wide security zone in
preparation for a large-scale attack on Lebanese and Palestinian
forces in Sidon.
   ``The information we received from the area today indicates that
are large-scale offensive is imminent,'' said Abu Sharif. He accused
the United States and Syria of supporting the Israeli action.

   Gunmen robbed and killed a Dutch-born
Roman Catholic priest when he returned to his house with medical
supplies for his mission hospital, another priest said today.
   The Rev. Cornelious Spil, 44, who had been in Uganda for 17
years, was fatally shot Saturday night by five men in military
uniform, said the Rev. Zonneveld James.
   James, of the Bwasale Mission Hospital in Iganga district, 110
miles east of Kampala, said three men had rifles.
   ``No sooner than Father Cornelius returned than the armed men
surrounded him as he got out of his car,'' James said. ``They forced
him into his house and demanded the keys for the safe where the
money was kept. The attackers also helped themselves to the
medicine, clothes and money.''
   They shot Spil as they fled, James said.
   Spil had bought the medical supplies at Jinja town, 40 miles east
of Kampala.
   James believed the raiders were criminals and not members of
armed groups fighting President Yoweri Museveni's government.
   Museveni, who waged a five-year guerrilla war against civilian
President Milton Obote's government, seized power in February 1986.
   At least eight groups have waged guerrilla battles against his
government and often raided civilians for food, clothes and medical
supplies.

<HEAD>Dukakis Releases Four New Ads; Bush Commercial Says Rival Misled

<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 2nd graf, The new, to UPDATE with Bush ad starting

<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis promises families and
workers he's ``on your side'' in four new television ads playing to
his party's strengths, while Republican George Bush alleges in
another spot that his rival misled 62 million Americans.
   The new Dukakis ads were scheduled to begin airing Thursday in
spot markets around the country, said spokeswoman Lorraine Voles.
The new Bush ad began airing Wednesday night, also in spot markets.
   The Bush spot, the latest development in a series of tit-for-tat
distortion charges, says the Massachusetts governor ``deliberately
misled'' 62 million Americans when he denied during the televised
Oct. 13 presidential debate that he raided his state pension system
to balance the budget.
   Quoting The Wall Street Journal as saying ``it is indisputable''
that Dukakis shifted the money, a narrator concludes: ``And Michael
Dukakis says George Bush is running a campaign of lies? Michael
Dukakis is unbelievable.''
   Dukakis and Bush each are running a mix of positive and attack
ads, concentrated most heavily in pivotal states like California,
Texas and Ohio.
   One of the new Dukakis ads shows an elderly couple on a bench in
an urban park. A voiceover says: ``Imagine a place where people can
grow old without being made to feel like a burden. Is that too much
to expect? As president, Michael Dukakis would be on your side. To
those who would cut Social Security, he'll say never. And he'll back
full cost-of-living adjustments.''
   Another shows children on a playground and says: ``Imagine a
place where children come out to play without fear of drugs or drug
dealers. Is that too much to expect? As president, Michael Dukakis
will be on your side. He'll declare a real war on drugs. Double the
number of drug agents and slash aid to countries that allow drug
traffic.''
   The other two spots talk about stretching two paychecks ``for the
life one paycheck used to bring'' and vow to ``take on the toughest
foreign competition and make America number one again.'' All four
ads end with the tagline: ``Dukakis-Bentsen. The best America is yet
to come.''
   The Dukakis campaign announced two more network appearances for
its candidate _ an interview with Dan Rather on the CBS Evening News
on Thursday night, 14 minutes long according to CBS producers; and
an interview Friday with NBC anchor Tom Brokaw for a series next
week on the candidate's positions.
   Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen was scheduled
to appear Wednesday night on CBS News. The Dukakis campaign also has
purchased five minutes of television time for Bentsen on the CBS
network Sunday night, said campaign adviser Tad Devine.
   Dukakis will be interviewed by David Frost for a Fox Television
network show to be broadcast Nov. 6, two days before the election.
   Since adopting a high-profile media strategy aimed at getting
voters to take another look at his candidacy, Dukakis has appeared
on the three network morning programs, a nationally televised cable
interview show and ABC's ``Nightline.''
   He also bought four five-minute, prime-time slots for a paid
advertisement that aired Saturday night on ABC. It was repeated
Tuesday night and will be shown again Nov. 1 and Nov. 5. Each airing
costs the campaign between $125,000 and $175,000.
   Bush had a stormy 9-minute confrontation with Rather on CBS News
last Jan. 25, during the height of the primary season. He turned
down the ``Nightline'' invitation, saying he had already appeared on
the show, but is weighing interview requests from other news and
talk shows.
   ``We're giving serious consideration to a few of them,'' said
Bush spokesman Mark Goodin. ``We will end up doing several. How many
I don't know. It's a question of whether we can get to them.''

   A judge has upheld the re-election of the
Selma mayor to a record seventh term, ruling that a black former
city councilman failed to provide any evidence the results were
tainted.
   Montgomery County Circuit Judge Joseph Phelps also ordered
challenger Cleophus Mann to pay all court costs. Phelps heard the
case in Dallas County, where Selma is located, after two Dallas
County judges removed themselves from the case.
   Mann failed by 433 votes to force a runoff from the Aug. 23
election with incumbent Mayor Joe Smitherman. Mann challenged the
results, saying polling places had been moved improperly and voters
were intimidated, but Phelps ruled Tuesday that the suit had no
basis.
   ``The plaintiff (Mann) testified he had no evidence that illegal
votes had been cast in the Aug. 23 election and did not offer any
evidence regarding the casting of illegal votes at trial,'' said
Phelps.
   ``I don't want to beat a dead dog, but there never was a case to
start with,'' Smitherman said. ``He had his day in court, and the
judge's order speaks for itself.''
   Mann refused to comment on the decision.
   Phelps said Mann's claim seemed to focus on allegations that the
city failed to obtain approval from the U.S. Justice Department
before moving several polling places, as required under the 1965
Voting Rights Act.
   But the judge noted that Mann voted for the changes when he
served on the city council and said that the moves were for the
convenience of voters, not for discriminatory purposes.
   During an Oct. 17 hearing, Mann testified that voters were
intimidated and pointed to the presence of Selma Police Chief M.E.
Summerlin at the polls wearing his weapon.
   But in his ruling, Phelps said he found ``no act of intimidation
or other acts of misconduct'' calculated to prevent the exercise of
the right to vote.
   Smitherman was elected to his first term as mayor of the western
Alabama city shortly before it drew national attention as a
battleground of the civil rights movement.

<TEXT>
   Plutonium particles floating in the air
inside a key nuclear weapons facility contaminated two employees and
a Department of Energy inspector on Sept. 29, a federal official
said.
   Earl Whiteman, who supervises a 60-person Energy Department
office at Rocky Flats, gave the report Tuesday night before 300
workers, plant critics and others, as he explained the incidents of
the past few weeks.
   But most of the audience said they left dissatisfied with
Whiteman's answers about contamination.
   ``We may sometimes not be good at explaining everything,''
Whiteman told the sometimes hostile crowd. ``But we damn well tell
the truth.''
   The response was boos and catcalls from half the audience.
   Whiteman focused on the Sept. 29 incident that led to the closing
of Building 771, the main production facility at the nuclear weapons
plant. The three people inhaled plutonium in their noses.
   The shutdown of the plant, and reports of problems at other
facilities in Ohio, South Carolina and elsewhere, have prompted a
national debate on the safety of nuclear defense plants.
   Whiteman said the three people walked into Room 114 without
wearing required respirators, didn't see a warning sign and so
walked near a bin storing plutonium waste.
   But then he said the bin never released plutonium in the air,
which prompted confusion about why the trio was exposed to plutonium.
   His answer was that it's not uncommon for Rocky Flats to operate
at 1 percent of the maximum allowable airborne radiation limit.
   Audience members said they couldn't understand why the building
was shut down if the exposure to plutonium was so minor, a tiny
fraction of what the average Coloradan is exposed to daily simply by
living here.
   Officials are cleaning up the airborne radioactivity while the
building is closed, Whiteman said. The building is expected to
reopen in a few weeks.
   ``We want to control it so once the building is clean, it will
stay clean,'' he said.

   Two Marine Corps helicopters crashed in a
desert gunnery range during a training excercise, killing all 10
servicemen aboard, officials said today.
   It was not immediately known whether the two helicopters
collided, said Cpl. Darren Fuller, a public affairs spokesman at the
Marine Corps Air Station in Yuma.
   It was the second crash involving military helicopters this week.
   The aircraft were being used in a ``troop insertion exercise''
with crews using night-vision goggles when the crash occurred, said
Army Maj. Linda Dumoulin, a Pentagon duty officer.
   Four people were on a Boeing CH-46 helicopter and six on a Bell
UH-1N copter. Both helicopters are designed to carry more troops but
were not transporting full teams for the exercise, which Dumoulin
said was part of a weapons-tactics instructor's course.
   There were no survivors, said Fuller.
   The copters went down in the remote desert site about 7:45 p.m.
Tuesday approximately 125 miles southeast of the air station, said
Fuller.
   An investigation team was at the site, he said. Names of the
victims were being withheld pending notification of next of kin.
   Yuma is about 180 miles southwest of Phoenix on the Colorado
River.
   Monday night, a UH-1H helicopter crashed near the U.S.-Mexico
border in California, killing the five lawmen and three National
Guardsmen aboard during the first mission of a joint anti-drug
smuggling program.
   The Army National Guard copter smashed into the rocky foothills
of the Laguna Mountains and burst into flames after striking the
500,000 kilowatt power line.

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany said today
the Soviets have agreed to release all people regarded in the West
as political prisoners within the next 10 weeks.
   Such a move would be one of the most dramatic signs yet from
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that he seeks a definitive
break with past Soviet human rights practices, which have included
the confinement of people who disagree publicly with Kremlin policy.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov refused to
confirm or deny that a release of political prisoners was in the
offing.
   Gerasimov said the number of political prisoners in the country
was about two dozen. However, political rights groups say there are
about 200 political prisoners in the Soviet Union.
   The White House said it was seeking further details, and a leader
of a group seeking emigration of Soviet Jews said he was
``skeptical'' of the reported promise.
   Gerasimov told a news briefing the issue of political prisoners
was not on the agenda of Soviet-West German negotiations that
brought Kohl to Moscow. Kohl held 10 hours of talks with Gorbachev
and other top Soviet officials.
   At a news conference, Kohl told reporters that during the talks
``the Soviets confirmed that they will release before the end of the
year all political prisoners as we understand it in the West.''
   When asked how many people that could involve, Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany replied, ``We are not in a
position to give final figures.''
   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group, said
last month the number of people imprisoned in Soviet labor camps,
psychiatric hospitals or exiled for their political beliefs numbered
about 200, compared to 10,000 a few years ago.
   In January, Soviet human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov gave
Gorbachev a list of 200 Soviets he said were imprisoned because of
their political or religious views.
   Many Western governments have given lists to the Soviets of
people they regard as jailed or held in psychiatric institutions for
their political or religious beliefs.
   In Washington, Deputy White House Press Secretary Roman Popadiuk
said, ``We have seen the news reports. We are awaiting further
details. If true, it is something we would look forward to.''
   In New York, the chairman of the National Conference on Soviet
Jewry, Morris Abram, said he was skeptical of the reported Soviet
promise.
   ``One will have to wait to see whether or not the promise is
confirmed by the practice,'' Abram told The Associated Press.
   ``I am skeptical because we've heard for a long time that the
Soviets are going to obey the obligation to let everyone leave the
country who wishes to leave. And that's just not happened,'' he said.
   When asked if the pledge had come from Gorbachev himself, Kohl
said only it was made ``during the talks.''
   Last year, Soviet authorities released at least 300 prisoners who
were being held on charges such as anti-Soviet agitation and
propaganda or slandering the Soviet state. Most Estonian and
Lithuanian nationalists who were being imprisoned for their views
have been released this year.
   The ruling Communist Party and government are reviewing the
Soviet penal code, and the United States has repeatedly urged that
the Soviets abolish those laws most often used to hold political
dissenters.
   Soviet officials contend the law under which they were charged,
forbidding dissemination of anti-Soviet propaganda or agitation, is
being softened in the revision of the Soviet criminal code.

   Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was
released today from Georgetown University Hospital, five days after
she underwent surgery for breast cancer.
   O'Connor returned to her home in Chevy Chase, Md., and is in good
condition, said Supreme Court spokeswoman Toni House.
   O'Connor, 58, reportedly underwent a mastectomy in which a breast
and the lymph glands under the arm are removed.
   No details of the operation have been confirmed. But O'Connor
said in an earlier statement that the cancer was detected in an
early stage and the prognosis is for a full recovery.
   She is expected to return to the bench Monday when the court ends
a two-week recess and resumes hearing oral arguments.

   A federal judge today dismissed the jury in the
perjury trial of Rep. Pat Swindall because of fliers that the
congressman had mailed out, making it unlikely Swindall could be
tried before Election Day.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Vining said he believed Swindall
violated court rules by sending out campaign mass mailings that
reached residents who were potential jurors in the case both last
week and this week.
   Vining said he was ``not inclined'' to use the only other avenue
through which Swindall could be tried before the election, a
non-jury trial with Vining determining the verdict.
   But Vining left the door open to such a possibility, telling
Swindall, ``I will call you in the morning and let you know if I've
changed my mind.'' He said he was unlikely to do so, but added,
``Judges are wont to change their minds.'' No date was immediately
set for the selection of a new jury, if the judge does not change
his mind about a non-jury trial.
   Swindall, 38, was indicted Oct. 17 on 10 perjury counts. The
charges cited his statements to a grand jury about his dealings with
a an undercover Internal Revenue Service agent posing as a money
broker, and Atlanta businessman Charles LeChasney, who already has
pleaded guilty to money laundering charges that do not involve
Swindall.
   Vining had copies of two mass mailings, one of which was dated
after the time that he ordered Swindall to obey local court rules on
his comments outside the courtroom.
   Copies of the mailings were not immediately available, but
Swindall said one was headlined, ``Why did Congrssman Pat Swindall
ask to be indicted?''
   Prosecutor Craig Gillen said Swindall should not be allowed to
keep up such mailings ``under the guise of running a political
campaign.''
   ``If Mr. Swindall prefers to run for office, he can't have his
cake and eat it too,'' Gillen said. ``If he wants to send these
mailings out, let's have the trial in December or November, and have
it in an orderly fashion.''
   Pounding the rostrum as he addressed Vining, Swindall said, ``I
find it absolutely incredible that the government tells me and the
voters of the 4th District that I have to make a choice between
running for re-election and coming down here and having this trial.''
   Vining had warned both sides prior to the trial that if they said
anything outside the courtroom that would affect the trial he would
take action.
   He did not place any specific subject areas off limits, but he
seemed particularly upset that one of the mailings had referred to
Swindall's claim that he had passed a polygraph test.
   After Vining dismissed the jury, Swindall said he was ``deeply
disappointed by the turn of events today.'' He said Vining's comment
that he could change his mind was ``a ray of hope.''
   U.S. Attorney Robert Barr declined to comment on Vining's ruling.
   Opening arguments by Swindall, a lawyer who is representing
himself, and Gillen had been set for today. A jury had been seated
Tuesday.
   Swindall was so anxious about the trial's pace Tuesday morning
that he suggested giving up his right to a jury, but Vining quickly
rejected that idea.
   Polls show the two-term Republican congressman from suburban
Atlanta faces a tough re-election bid against Democrat Ben Jones in
the Nov. 8 election.
   In his appearance before a grand jury in February, Swindall, who
was looking for an $850,000 home mortgage, said he did not recall
being told the money broker's backers might be laundering illegal
drug proceeds. The government, which secretly recorded several
meetings, charges Swindall lied in his account.
   Swindall's questioning of prospective jurors revealed that he may
call former presidential candidate Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., to the
witness stand.
   Swindall asked two former New York residents who were on the
panel of prospective jurors if they knew Kemp, who ran
unsuccessfully for the GOP presidential nomination this year.
Neither of the two was chosen as a juror.
   Swindall later said he is considering calling Kemp to testify. He
said he will decide later based on how the government presents its
case.
   Swindall, who was a co-chairman of Kemp's presidential campaign
in Georgia, said last week he might call some members of Congress
and administration officials as character witnesses.

   Fewer than half of 1 percent of health care workers
mistakenly exposed to AIDS-tainted blood through cuts, needle wounds
or other accidents become infected with the lethal virus, a new
survey shows.
   The review, conducted at 335 hospitals across the United States,
concludes that ``the risk of HIV infection after exposure to the
blood of a patient infected with HIV is low.''
   The risk of catching AIDS from patients is a serious concern in
many hospitals. The latest research confirms earlier studies showing
that while this threat is slight, on-the-job infection can happen.
   The researchers followed 1,201 nurses and other hospital workers
who came into contact with the blood of people infected with HIV,
the AIDS virus. A report on the work, directed by Ruthanne Marcus of
the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, was published in this
week's New England Journal of Medicine.
   Results of AIDS testing were available for 963 of the health care
workers, and four of them, or 0.42 percent, were infected as a
result of needle sticks.
   Two of the four cases occurred when people were accidentally
stuck with needles by fellow workers during emergency resuscitation
procedures.
   Among the report's findings:
   _Sixty-three percent of the potential AIDS exposures occurred in
nurses, 14 percent in doctors and medical students, 11 percent in
lab technicians, 7 percent in people drawing blood, 3 percent in
respiratory therapists and 2 percent in housekeeping and maintenance
workers.
   _Eight percent of the exposures resulted from needle sticks. The
rest were cuts with sharp objects, open wound contamination and
exposure to mucous membranes.
   _Thirty-seven percent of the exposures could have been prevented
if routine precautions had been followed.
   The researchers said their work ``underscores the need to handle
sharp instruments carefully in all circumstances, even during
emergencies.''
   In a separate report in the journal, researchers reported on the
high rate of AIDS infection at a hospital in Kinshasa, Zaire. They
said there was no evidence that the health care workers had gotten
their infections on the job, because the infection rate was the same
among those with heavy contact with patients and those who rarely
saw patients.
   The research, conducted by Dr. Bosenge N'Galy and colleagues from
Project SIDA, was based on AIDS infection tests given to 2,002
workers at Mama Yemo Hospital.

at Upset</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis declared today the ``pollsters are
not going to call the election'' and heard Hispanic leaders say that
a heavy voter turnout by their constituents could deliver a
Democratic upset on Election Day.
   The Democratic presidential nominee had breakfast with Hispanic
leaders in Denver the morning after he said during in a 90-minute
interview on ABC-TV's ``Nightline'' that he was making ``real
progess'' against Republican rival George Bush. Most national polls
suggest otherwise.
   ``The pollsters are not going to call the election,'' Dukakis
told reporters in a statement. ``It's people who are going to be
voting.''
   Dukakis claimed overwhelming support among Hispanics, which he
said stemmed from his longstanding commitment to minority issues,
especially the war against drugs.
   ``They want a president who doesn't talk about the subject but
who has done something about it,'' the Massachusetts governor said.
   The Hispanic leaders praised Dukakis for his commitment to civil
and voting rights, affirmative action, urban renewal and economic
development.
   They said Hispanics are grossly under-represented in presidential
polls, and that a 70 percent turnout among them could swing a close
election in Dukakis' favor.
   Rep. Albert Bustamante of Texas saluted Dukakis as both a
``technocrat'' and the ``liberal of 1988.'' He said this meant
Dukakis cared children, the elderly, health care and the environment.
   When Bustamante used the word technocrat, Dukakis grinned and
chimed in ``15 percent.'' The candidate did not take questions from
reporters.
   During his TV interview with Ted Koppel, Dukakis said conceded he
was partly to blame for not answering early GOP campaign attacks on
his record.
   But he claimed he was gaining on the vice president despite new
polls showing he was trailing Bush by double-digit margins.
   ``I feel good about things,'' he said in the nationally televised
interview. ``I think we're making some real progress.''
   After the program Dukakis told reporters he thought the interview
was ``great, terrific.''
   Dukakis was campaigning in Colorado and Illinois today and
planned to keep a high television profile in the remaining days of
the campaign, including an interview with CBS on Thursday and NBC on
Friday.
   Dukakis was questioned on a broad range of issues during the
``Nightline'' appearance, giving the Reagan administration some
credit for winning arms control agreements with the Soviet Union
while denouncing the administration _ and specifically Bush _ for
failing in the war on drugs.
   ``I'm willing to get much, much tougher than this
administration'' in the drug fight, he said. But he reiterated his
opposition to capital punishment regardless of the offense.
   It was not until well into the interview that Dukakis raised the
issue he has been focusing on in his speeches in recent days: Bush's
support of a capital gains tax credit that Dukakis characterizes as
a boon for the rich, including the vice president himself, that will
result in an added burden on average Americans.
   Koppel, after referring to the latest polls, asked Dukakis what
Bush had done to ``nail your hide to the wall thus far.''
   Dukakis did not dispute the characterization before blaming his
position in the polls on a relentlessly negative GOP campaign and
his failure to counterattack.
   ``The Bush campaign made a very careful and deliberate decision
way back in the spring to run a tough, attacking, negative campaign
and they've been doing it ever since. And perhaps I responded too
late, perhaps I should have been out there attacking or
counterattacking from the beginning,'' Dukakis said.
   ``They questioned my patriotism, they questioned my wife's
patriotism ... they questioned my health and that kind of thing has
made this a tough and difficult campaign.''
   He accused BUsh of ducking the issues by running a campaign
``loaded with distortion ad misrepresentation and falsehoods.''
   Two polls released Tuesday night reported Bush held a
double-digit lead in the presidential race with only two weeks to
Election Day.
   A CBS News-New York Times survey of 1,287 probable voters showed
Bush leading Dukakis 54-41 percent while a Gallup poll of 815 likely
voters showed Bush up by 14 points, 53-3 percent.
   The CBS-Times poll was conducted Friday through Monday and had a
margin of error of three points. The Gallup survey was done Friday
through Sunday and had a four-point error margin.
   Dukakis said his own instincts indicated voters were turning
against the Republican campaign tactics, however. Asked about the
polls after the television interview, he said simply, ``Forging
ahead.''
   Dukakis came to Colorado after spending Tuesday morning
campaigning in California, where he took issue with a Republican
campaign commercial ridiculing him for riding in an Army tank.
   ``We Democrats are for a strong defense,'' he said. ``That's
nonsense,'' he said of the ad's assertion that he has opposed
virtually all new proposed weapons systems.

   A rhinoceros killed an animal
researcher from Scotland who was doing field work in a provincial
game reserve, authorities said Wednesday.
   Joanna Copley of St. Andrews University in Scotland was watching
a pack of baboons with a colleague as part of a research project on
Tuesday at the Mkuzi Game Reserve in Zululand when the rhinoceros
attacked, said June Payn, a spokeswoman for the Natal Province Parks

   The rhinoceros struck Ms. Copley, 23, with its horn and broke her
neck, Ms. Payn said.
   The animal apparently was searching for its calf when it charged.
The second researcher, Stephen Whitehead of Natal University, jumped
out of the way and was not injured.

   The European Court of Human Rights on
Wednesday ruled that longstanding Irish laws against homosexuality
violate human rights.
   The 8-6 ruling marked a victory for David Norris, an Irish
homosexual and advocate of homosexual rights who filed the case.
   Although rarely used, 19th century Irish laws ban certain
homosexual acts, even if carried out in private between consenting
adults. An 1861 Irish law punishes sodomy with a maximum penalty of
life imprisonment.
   Norris based his argument on the international Human Rights
Convention, which establishes the right to respect for private life.
   The European court has no power to enforce its ruling.

   A judge sentenced six Hindus to life

Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, news reports said Wednesday.
   Tuesday's sentences were the first in connection with the riots
that killed at least 3,000 people, mostly Sikhs, during three days
after Mrs. Gandhi's slaying on Oct. 31, 1984, according to the The

   The riots broke out in reaction to news that the prime minister
was killed by two Sikh bodyguards. The Hindus were sentenced after
they were convicted of killing four Sikhs in the rioting, the United
News of India news agency said.
   Sikh radicals campaigning for a separate homeland have demanded
punishment of the rioters. Sikhs, who make up 2 percent of India's
population, claim the country's Hindu majority discriminates against
them.

<HEAD>Obstetric Committee Says Caesarean Births Should No Longer Be
Routine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guidelines issued today by the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists say women who have had babies
delivered by Caesarean section should be encouraged to have later
children by normal, vaginal birth.
   Dr. Mary Jo O'Sullivan, a member of an ACOG panel that developed
the guidelines, said a pregnant women who has had an earlier child
by Caesarean section ``should be encouraged to attempt labor in her
current pregnancy'' instead of routinely undergoing a second
surgical delivery.
   ``This is the first time in over 70 years we are saying that a
patient who has had a C-section should not have a repeat C-section
unless there is a definite medical need,'' she said at a news
conference.
   The significant shift of emphasis stems from a gradual increase
of statistical data that shows mothers and babies generally fare
better with vaginal delivery _ even if the mother has previously had
a low transverse incision C-section, she said.
   As with any surgical procedure, C-sections are more costly than
natural delivery and raise the prospect of the same type of
potential complications always attendant surgery, such as infections
and reactions to anthesia.
   Dr. O'Sullivan said if the new guidelines are accepted by U.S.
hospitals, they will go a long way toward ending the ``once a
C-section, always a C-section'' tradition that has guided obstetric
practice since 1916.
   The ACOG committee found that women who have had a C-section by
the low-transverse method were successful in subsequent vaginal
delivery attempts in most cases.
   ``Up to 70 percent of these women who had their first Caesarean
birth because of failure to progress in a long and difficult labor
were able to deliver vaginally with their second child,'' Dr.
O'Sullivan said.
   Since 1982, the ACOG has urged physicians to encourage women to
attempt vaginal deliveries even after prior C-sections. The action
was taken after a number of studies indicated that mortality rates
for mother and child were lower among women who attempted labor than
among those who chose repeated Caesarean births.
   Until recent years, it was believed that once a woman had had a
C-section, all subsequent children had to be delivered the same way.
The number of C-sections routinely performed in recent years,
however, has declined and the new guidelines are intended to
encourage this trend.
   In 1987, about 24.4 percent of all live births, or 934,000 of 3.8
million, were performed by C-section. About 35 percent of the
surgical births were repeat C-sections.
   The surgical procedure would continue to be used where medically
indicated, such as for some breech births, when there are signs that
the baby is in distress, or following a difficult and prolonged
attempt at labor.
   The ACOG announcement said C-sections will continue to be used
for women who have had a previous ``classical'' Caesarean. In this
procedure, the uterus is incised vertically, a technique now rarely
used. About 99 percent of all C-sections now use a transverse
incision which goes from one side to the other, instead of up and
down.

   Inadequately maintained Coleman mobile-home
furnaces could pose a danger, the manufacturer said Wednesday in
announcing it will inspect the furnaces and offer a discount on
replacements.
   About 100,000 Model 8600 Solar Pak mobile home-furnaces are
involved in the warning, the federal Consumer Product Safety
Commission reported.
   The commission said that both it and Coleman have received
reports of carbon monoxide poisoning involving furnaces that have
either been inadequately maintained or altered in some way.
   About 380,000 of the furnaces were made between 1964 and 1971,
but officials say they expect only about 100,000 remain in use.
   Coleman is offering owners of the units a free cooler as an
incentive to participate in the safety inspection program.
   The suspect furnaces can be identified by the name Coleman on the
front and the rating plate inside the furnace door, which will state
if it is a Coleman 8600 Solar Pak.
   Owners of the furnaces, and those uncertain about their units,
can telephone Coleman at 1-800-232-SOLR. The company will arrange
for an inspection by its nearest service center.
   If repairs or replacement are needed, the company is offering a
50 percent discount to owners of these units.
   Those needing further information can contact the Consumer
Product Safety Commission at 1-800-638-2772.

<TEXT>
   NATO defense ministers begin a series of
talks Thursday that will focus on whether the alliance needs more
powerful nuclear weapons for front-line combat.
   Since the United States and the Soviet Union signed a treaty in
December to eliminate medium-range nuclear weapons, much attention
has shifted to upgrading short-range nuclear artillery and missiles.
   The talks of the Brussels-based North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, which begin at The Hague, Netherlands, will focus on
whether the Western alliance should modernize these forces.
   A Dutch defense specialist, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
told reporters in The Hague that the talks will ``make an inventory
of our options.'' The source said the discussions would provide Gen.
John Galvin, commander of NATO forces in Europe, with guidelines for
making a decision in 1989 or 1990.
   Most NATO nations want to extend the range of the short-range
tactical weapons to make up for the loss of weapons under the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty. That pact eliminated all
U.S. and Soviet land-based missiles with ranges from 300 to 3,000
miles.
   The range of a new generation of weapons would likely be extended
up to the treaty limits of about 300 miles, analysts say.
   A key candidate for upgrading is the Lance surface-to-surface
missile, which was introduced in 1972 and which military analysts
say will be obsolete by 1995. The Lance has a range of just over 62
miles, but a new system might boost that above 248 miles.
   The United States and United Kingdom have indicated support for
modernizing the short-range weapons. But Germany and the
Netherlands, which have strong anti-nuclear movements, have argued
that such a decision is not yet needed.
   The defense ministers, meeting as NATO's Nuclear Planning Group,
gather twice a year.
   Fourteen of NATO's 16 members will take part in the talks.
Iceland attends only as an observer, and France operates outside
NATO's common military planning. U.S. Defense Secretary Frank
Carlucci will represent the United States.

<HEAD>Doctors: Halloween Egg Throwing No Joke</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Egg tossing during Halloween can be a dangerous
prank, resulting in severe eye damage to those who are hit, doctors
warned Thursday.
   In a letter in the New England Journal of Medicine, two New
Jersey doctors describe five cases of eye injury that resulted from
thrown eggs during Halloween week last year. The victims were four
teen-agers and a 72-year-old man.
   Four of them required hospitalization, and two were left with
severe damage to their vision.
   ``Halloween should be added to the list of holidays posing a
danger of eye injuries. Physicians and parents should educate young
people about the ocular (eye) catastrophes that can occur on a night
meant only for pranks and fun,'' wrote Drs. Philip M. Fiore and
Rudolph S. Wagner of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New
Jersey in Newark.

<HEAD>Tiffany's Breaks Out the Good China at Manners Classes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Food fights are a faux pas at the elegant tables
of Tiffany's, where moppets sip instead of slurp from the finest
crystal and china.
   ``At first, they have looks on their faces like, `My mother made
me do this,''' said Annie Cater, who runs table manners classes for
Tiffany & Co. in seven cities. ``But by the time the class is over,
the little boys are seating everybody at the graduation party and
the kids are toasting one another.''
   In the past two years, Ms. Cater has helped polish the table
manners of more than 900 children and adults, including executives
concerned about which fork to use at important business lunches. It
all started with the kids.
   ``A friend said, `I want you to teach my Brownie class some
etiquette.' So I got the (Tiffany's etiquette) book, the silver,
crystal and china. I had 28 8-year-olds in my face. I almost died,''
she recalled.
   She succeeded, though, and went on to convince Tiffany's that it
could market the concept. Now, there are 109 kids, ages 8 to 16, on
the waiting list in Houston, and classes are springing up in
Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, San Francisco and Costa Mesa,
Calif.
   ``They learn not to shout across the table, to pass the salt over
their arm _ things they'll remember,'' said Ms. Cater. ``I think
it's (successful) because I'm not their mother. There's no peer
pressure. I make it very comfortable for them.''
   ``It's just such fun. Children are fascinating,'' she added.
   And unpredictable.
   ``I was on live TV with a little boy. I said, `Jason tell
everybody what this is.'
   ``He said, `It's a finger bowl.'
   ``I said, `Do you have those at home?'
   ``He said, `Yes. My father drinks margaritas out of those.'''
   Most kids first guess the bowl holds lemonade or soup. But soon,
they're dunking their pinkies like pros.
   ``We do use Tiffany china, crystal and silver,'' said Ms. Cater.
``We've had a couple of things spilled, but nothing broken. I think
they know when they come in here that it's special and precious.
Once they hold it, they're going to like it.''
   After learning the basics in a class of 12 during two hour-long
sessions at the store, the students dress up for a graduation meal
at a hotel.
   Afterward, Ms. Cater often gets thank-you notes. One boy wrote:
``Now, I can eat with the kings.''
   ``What makes me feel so good about it is they go home and they
use the things they've learned. Even if they're going to McDonald's
that night, they remember that their bread and butter plate is on
the left and their glass on the right.''
   Adults are flocking to the classes, too _ learning the rudiments
of napkin-folding and olive-nibbling at mock dinners and cocktail
parties.
   ``If you're out in the business world and don't have good table
manners you'll be in trouble,'' said Ms. Cater. ``If you know what
fork you're going to use, then you can listen to the business
conversation, enjoy the food and what's going on around you.''
   The lesson price differs, depending on the city. In Houston, it's
$65 for children and $100 for adults.

<HEAD>Thatcher to Try for Unprecedented Fourth Term</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, already the
West's longest-serving leader after nearly a decade in power, says
she will seek an unprecedented fourth term, a newspaper reported
Wednesday.
   The 63-year-old Conservative chief of state said she planned to
lead her party into the next election and remain prime minister for
another five-year term if it wins, according to an interview in the
Times of London. The election must be held by 1992.
   The Conservatives named Mrs. Thatcher prime minister in May 1979
after they defeated a Labor Party government. She has championed
individual initiative and hands-off government as an ideological
partner of President Reagan.
   ``Some time, there will come along a person who can do it better
than I can,'' she was quoted as saying. ``And I'm always on the
lookout. But I expect myself to do it for the fourth term.''
   Asked if she had a date in mind to retire, she was quoted as
saying, ``No, but obviously one isn't indestructible.''
   In the same interview, Mrs. Thatcher defended her government's
week-old ban on interviews by domestic broadasters with members of
the Irish Republican Army. She said she may even extend the order to
foreign-based networks.
   ``To beat off your enemy in a war, you have to suspend some of
your civil liberties for a time.''
   The new rules prohibit domestic broadcasters from interviewing
members of the outlawed IRA and 10 other militant groups in Northern
Ireland.
   The predominantly Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in
Northern Ireland and unite the 60 percent Protestant province with
the 95 percent Catholic Irish Republic.
   Asked about possible IRA interviews with foreign-based satellite
television stations due to broadcast in Britain next year, Mrs.
Thatcher said: ``The only thing we could do here is to make it an
offense to beam such stuff into this country if need be.''
   Opposition and civil rights groups have said the ban fails as an
anti-terrorist weapon and interferes with freedom of the press.
   The government also announced last week it would abolish the
right of all criminal suspects in Northern Ireland, England and
Wales to remain silent during police interrogation.

   Two Soviet icebreakers flying
U.S. and Soviet flags worked today to smash through an ice ridge as
dawn approached on what rescuers hope will be freedom day for two
whales imprisoned in ice for nearly three weeks.
   ``The whales seemed to be doing fine,'' Rear Adm. Sigmund
Petersen of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said
this morning. ``It's like they expected something to be happening.
Everything seems to be coming together.''
   Rescuers had one of their best days yet Tuesday as the
unprecedented international effort to save the two California gray
whales neared a climax. They succeeded in moving the huge mammals
around a shoal that had stymied progress for three days.
   As darkness fell Tuesday, the mammals were only about two miles
from the water being opened by the Soviet ships.
   The whales could be free by late this afternoon if things go as
well today as they did the day before, said NOAA rescue coordinator
Ron Morris.
   ``We feel very good about it,'' Petersen said this morning. ``The
cooperation has just been fantastic. The Soviets came in here with a
very positive attitude and went to work immediately.''
   Later today, rescuers planned to use a tractor-like device
propelled by pontoon augers to cut the relatively thin ice remaining
between the whales and the icebreakers' farthest advance.
   ``We certainly hope it will end today,'' Petersen said. ``We are
just hoping that things are just coming together.''
   In another development Tuesday, the Federal Aviation
Admininistration ordered flights around Barrow Point to stay above
2,000 feet because of crowding by small planes taking a look at the
whales, The Washington Post said.
   Around noon Tuesday, Morris, Petersen and Capt. Jim McClelland of
the U.S. Coast Guard flew to the icebreaker Admiral Makarov as it
waited about 25 miles northeast of Barrow.
   After a perfunctory briefing, the icebreaker's skipper said he
was ready to begin work immediately.
   ``We shall commence just now,'' said Sergei Fedorovich Reshetov.
``In five minutes, our engines will be ready.''
   The 440-foot icebreaker, an American flag flying above its
frost-encrusted superstructure, quickly cruised through thin ice to
the pressure ridge that is the last significant barrier to freedom.
In just a few hours, the ship had battled almost three-fourths of
the way through the ridge, a jumble of ice blocks as big as small
houses.
   With only about 100 yards to go, the Admiral Makarov, which draws
about 40 feet of water, nearly ran out of room. McClelland said he
thought the ship nudged the seabed from time to time.
   The plan was for the 496-foot Vladimir Arseniev, an ice-breaking
cargo ship which draws only about 20 feet, to finish the job.
Rescuers, however, did not think the smaller ship could go all the
way to the whales.
   The Admiral Makarov ran its bow up over the ice, shuddering only
slightly as its 20,000 tons broke through thicknesses of 6 to 8 feet.
   Spidery cracks raced in all directions outward from the ship as
it battered its way through ice blanketed with snow bearing the
tracks of polar bears.
   The vessel repeated the maneuver again and again, leaving
millions of dirty ice cubes as rubble.
   ``It's a magnificent ship,'' Petersen said as he watched the
icebreaker work.
   ``With the wind going as it is, it couldn't be better,''
McClelland said.
   Rescuers counted on a steady east wind and prevailing currents to
carry debris left by the icebreakers out of the whales' path.
   Meanwhile, chain saw-wielding Eskimos cut a detour for the whales
to swim around shallow water through which the animals had refused
to pass.
   By cutting breathing holes in deeper water away from the shoal,
the Eskimos were able to lure the whales about two miles from the
place where they were found. A third whale disappeared Friday and is
believed dead.
   The icebreakers had been returning to their home port of
Vladivostok when they were diverted, said Alexander Patzevich, chief
officer and second in command. The vessels dropped off personnel and
1,000 tons of equipment to establish a floating polar research
station last week.
   Although the Admiral Makarov has been at sea for six months and
``everybody is tired,'' none of the crew of 78 has complained about
the diversion, Patzevich said.
   ``It's very nice to work together,'' he said of the U.S.-Soviet
effort.
   The North Slope Borough helicopter that flew whale-rescue team
members to the icebreaker took Reshetov and several crew members to
see the whales.
   First Mate Vladimir Moroz, who said he was the ship's political
officer, said the Soviets were happy to help.
   He said he spoke to a Moscow newspaper by telephone on Monday.
   ``They're receiving many, many calls asking about the whales,''
Moroz said. ``Our country is watching like everyone else. We love
animals, just as everyone.''
   Moroz said another Soviet icebreaker helped free a pod of beluga
whales trapped in Bering Sea ice across from Alaska three years ago.
   The Admiral Makarov bore a gold-colored hammer and sickle on its
smokestack, and a Soviet flag flew from the stern. McClelland said
the captain's decision to fly a U.S. flag was a common courtesy.
   ``Normally, a merchant ship will fly the flag of the country it's
working in,'' he said.
   Small airplanes crowding the skies over the whales prompted the
FAA restriction.
   ``To have these airplanes swarming around like little bees over
the rescue operations turns into a nightmare on the ground,'' Paul
Steucke, an FAA spokesman in Anchorage, told the Post. ``In
addition, it's one heck of a hazard in the sky. The opportunity to
hit each other is quite high.''
   Normally, there are two commercial flights in and out of Barrow
each day.

   A man upset over being fired took his
former manager and three other employees hostage today, but
surrendered after talking to a television reporter and police
negotiators, police said. No one was hurt.
   The man was armed with a pistol, which he gave to his former
manager when he surrendered, said D.P. Capell, commander of the
patrol division for Charlotte Police.
   Capell said the man released the three other employees when the
reporter arrived. He surrendered after talking to the reporter and
negotiators for about an hour, he said.
   The man told WSOC-TV he was upset at being fired with little
notice after working long hours for Floortech Inc., assignment
editor Wayne Houseman said. Floortech is a floor tile manufacturer.
   ``He called his girlfriend and she called us,'' Houseman said.
``We called the company and (he) answered the phone, saying he was
upset and he knew he would go to jail for what he was doing but he
wanted to make a statement and was tired of being pushed around.''
   Houseman said the station alerted police, who were already aware
of the situation. He said the man asked to talk to a reporter, who
went into the plant with police negotiators.
   The man surrendered two hours after the incident began, shortly
before 11 a.m., and was taken to the Charlotte Law Enforcement
Center, police said.
   No charges were filed by late morning, and police declined to
release the man's name.

<HEAD>In Home Stretch, Dukakis Turns to Proven Populist Themes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As his underdog campaign draws to a close,
Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis is leaning on his party's
traditional populist themes that put Harry Truman over the top in
1948 and shifted millions of votes to Hubert Humphrey in 1968.
   The Massachusetts governor has touted his competence. He's
boasted about his good judgment in selecting Lloyd Bentsen as his
vice presidential running mate. He's attacked ethical lapses in the
Reagan administration. And he's derided Republican rival George Bush
as the artificial creation of cynical handlers.
   But with his growing deficit in the polls and the increasing
impatience of his supporters, Dukakis is finally homing in on a
class-oriented, Easy Street vs. Main Street message that has served
Democrats well in the past.
   ``The real question is, will we have a president who fights for
the privileged few, or will we have a president who fights for
you?'' he asks in a late October campaign advertisement typical of
his new approach.
   ``George Bush wants to give the wealthiest 1 percent of the
people in this country a new tax break worth $30,000 a year,'' he
says. ``I'm fighting for you and your family, for affordable housing
and health care, for better jobs, for the best education and
opportunity for our children.''
   Democratic consultants with long memories can hardly conceal
their elation. They say they've been urging Dukakis to take this
tack for months.
   ``There's now been a shift to distinguishing what really makes
the Democrats distinctive and different. We care about the average
person. We believe government can have a constructive role in
helping the average person,'' says Stuart Eizenstat, an unofficial
adviser to the Dukakis campaign who formerly worked for Humphrey and
President Carter.
   ``It's very important for a Democratic candidate to remind people
who does what for them,'' says adviser Robert Hunter, a foreign
affairs specialist and a former Humphrey speechwriter.
   ``The governor is catching up with the kind of strategy that can
work for him and, let's hope better late than never, pays off,''
Hunter said.
   Twenty years ago, with Humphrey lagging 15 points behind Richard
Nixon three weeks before the 1968 election, pollster Vic Fingerhut
wrote a memo that resonates eerily in 1988.
   Fingerhut's advice to the Humphrey campaign: Concentrate on
voters likely to cross party lines (George Wallace and Nixon
Democrats in 1968, Reagan Democrats in 1988). Reach them with short
TV ads. Stress economic themes. Raise the specters of education and
social spending cutbacks. And hammer home the idea that Humphrey is
``a tough fighter for the common man.''
   The memo cited findings that Truman won late votes because of
economic concerns, not because he was a feisty underdog. ``People
came to vote for Truman faster than they came to like him,''
Fingerhut wrote.
   His conclusion: forget about trying to make Humphrey likable and
go back to Democratic roots.
   According to Fingerhut, 8 million votes shifted to the vice
president in the final three weeks before the 1968 election, most of
them blue-collar and middle-class voters with socially conservative
attitudes _ the same kinds of people Dukakis needs to attract.
   Fingerhut attributes 7 million of those votes to economic
concerns. Others, such as Eizenstat, say part of the late rally was
promoted by Humphrey's declaration of independence from President
Johnson on the Vietnam War, but they say economic issues were at
least equally important.
   The Dukakis camp, their candidate more comfortable as a
clean-government crusader than a class warrior, auditioned other
messages for weeks.
   ``They tried real hard to re-invent the wheel and when they ended
up, it wasn't even round,'' said Dan Payne, a Boston advertising
executive who did primary spots for Dukakis.
   Now, in his speeches and commercials, Dukakis talks of day care,
family leave, education, jobs, trade, home ownership, health care
and the struggles of two-earner families to keep up.
   ``He's on their side,'' he says of Bush and the wealthy. ``I'm on
your side.''
   Will wavering Democrats and independents respond to this late
populist appeal?
   Eizenstat said those issues proved potent for Humphrey in the
face of a Nixon assault that included the same charges of weak on
defense and soft on crime that Bush is using against Dukakis.
   ``Now that people are really focused on the (1988) campaign, they
will respond to the very same bread-and-butter issues,'' Eizenstat
said.
   Dukakis has a few problems that Humphrey didn't have. The
Democratic majority of registered voters is smaller than it was in
1968, and party ties are weaker. Humphrey was part of a Democratic
administration, while Dukakis is a non-Washington candidate who must
convince voters that the White House needs a change of party.
   Humphrey was further behind than Dukakis in the final stretch of
the campaign, though his momentum by Election Day led many to
believe that Humphrey could have beaten Nixon in a few more days.
   ``The Humphrey and Truman models should be the Dukakis model,''
says Fingerhut. ``If he follows those models he can win the
election.''

<HEAD>Panel Begins Work To Define What Values To Teach In New Jersey
Schools</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM KRATTENMAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A committee of educators, students and
religious leaders has begun compiling a list of values to be taught
in New Jersey schools, starting with honesty, compassion, courage
and hard work.
   The difficulty will be figuring out ``what else there is,'' said
Gov. Thomas H. Kean, who ordered the group to come up with its
recommendations by March.
   Kean announced his values-education campaign earlier this year.
The committee began its work Tuesday.
   ``We're all aware of the fact this effort is going to be complex
and is a little controversial,'' said Richard Herold, a lawyer and
chairman of the 20-member panel.
   New Jersey joins other states, including Maryland, California and
New York, working to bring values into public education despite
wariness that it could violate constitutional principles of
separation of church and state.
   The trend has been applauded by conservative groups as well as
the civil liberties organization People for the American Way, which
endorses values education as long as tolerance is one of the lessons
stressed.
   ``There has been a growing consensus that students aren't born
knowing the difference between right and wrong any more than they're
born with the knowledge of calculus,'' said David Crane, education
issues director for People for the American Way, based in
Washington, D.C.
   Kean, a Republican, lamented such disgraced national figures as
former White House aide Michael Deaver and Wall Street giant Ivan
Boesky.
   Good citizenship, Kean said, is as important to teach as English
and chemistry.
   ``What teachers tell me and counselors tell me again and again is
there doesn't seem to be anything these youth can put their faith
in,'' Kean said, adding that ``amoral'' young people are easy marks
for drug dealers.
   Values would not be taught in a single class, but would be laced
through the curriculum from elementary grades to high school,
Education Commissioner Saul Cooperman said.
   He suggested young students could be taught the sacredness of
promises, for example, while older students could learn about the
importance of crediting sources in English papers.
   Details, such as whether students would be graded on the values
they learn, have yet to be determined.
   Teachers and administrators would have to teach by example,
Cooperman said.
   ``We can't say, `Do as I say, but don't do as I do,''' he said.
``Kids see through that in five seconds.''
   The panel chosen by Cooperman represents a wide range of
geography and backgrounds and includes a rabbi, Baptist minister and
Catholic bishop. The only thing the members have in common is their
own good citizenship, Kean said.
   A spokesman for a national youth advocacy group applauded New
Jersey's efforts but warned it would be a ``tricky wicket'' to
produce a list that has both substance and universal acceptance.
   ``I think it's the kind of thing we need to weave into the
educational experience,'' said Mike Buscemi, senior vice president
of the organization, Quest International of Granville, Ohio. ``We
have a lot of kids who are floundering and looking for direction.''

   William Dorn Jr., who was suspended from the
Roman Catholic priesthood after revealing he is homosexual, has been
banned from the priesthood forever and officially excommunicated.
   A church tribunal found Dorn guilty of leaving the Catholic
church, and joining the Episcopal church.
   The ruling puts an end to a two-year public dispute in which Dorn
and the church clashed over the former priest's outspoken challenges
to Catholic teachings on homosexuality and his ultimate revelation
that he is gay.
   ``It's over,'' Dorn, 36, said after learning of the ruling
Tuesday.
   The tribunal's ruling was dated Sept. 30 and delivered to Dorn on
Tuesday by his church-appointed lawyer, the Rev. James Zusy of the
Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis. Zusy declined to comment on
the matter.
   Dorn said that he was told not to speak about the decree, but he
notified news media about the ruling and issued a statement critical
of the church.
   Former St. Cloud Bishop George Speltz fired Dorn from his job at
the Christ Church Newman Center at St. Cloud State University in
October 1986 after he wrote a newspaper article advocating a more
compassionate view of homosexuality. He was suspended from the
priesthood a few weeks later.
   Dorn, who lives in Minneapolis, declined to discuss his personal
life or possible plans to seek ordination in the Episcopal church.

Year</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   First-year base wage increases excluding
cost-of-living adjustments or COLAs averaged 3.3 percent in major
union contracts negotiated in the first nine months of this year,
the government said Wednesday.
   Including COLAs but not lump-sum bonuses now prevalent in
manufacturing, union workers under major contracts received
effective pay increases averaging 3.5 percent over the past year,
the Labor Department said.
   The average annual increase in the new contracts falls to 2.8
percent over their usual two-to-three-year lives, the Bureau of
Labor Statistics said, indicating a return to so-called front-loaded
contracts.
   Back-loaded contracts in which the biggest increases came closer
to the expiration of the accords than at their beginning had
dominated labor relations from the 1981-82 recession until last
year, according to government figures.
   Eighty percent of the some 1.4 million workers covered in major
contracts negotiated so far in 1988 received first-year increases in
their base pay, the bureau said. Eighteen percent accepted wage
freezes, and 2 percent gave up pay concessions.
   The bureau said 35 percent of those covered in contracts
negotiated from January through September of this year received
first-year wage adjustments of between 2 percent and 4 percent.
   Twenty-eight percent of the covered workers received base pay
adjustments between 4 percent and 6 percent. Adjustments of less
that 2 percent went to 14 percent of the covered workers in new
contracts while 3 percent received first-year adjustments greater
than 6 percent of their base wage.
   Including those who agreed to wage freezes or concessions in the
first year of newly negotiated contracts, the average base wage
increase in the first year of newly negotiated contracts was 2.5
percent, the government said.
   The cost-of-living adjustments or COLAs designed to adjust wages
to reflect changes in consumer prices were introduced or
reestablished for about 11 percent or 161,000 of the covered workers
under settlements reached so far this year.
   The government said virtually all of them are Teamsters covered
by the National Master Freight Agreement negotiated last spring. The
new three-year trucking industry contract reestablish a COLA that
had been suspended during the past accord.
   As a result, the government said, the proportion of union workers
covered by COLA protections in their contracts has climbed from 38
percent at the end of 1987 to 40 percent as of Oct. 1. In the 1970s,
more than half of all union workers had COLA provisions in their
contracts.
   Both COLAs and lump-sum bonuses continue to be more prevalent in
manufacturing than service industries.
   Labor contracts with manufacturers now provide some 51 percent of
the covered workers with lump-sum bonuses ranging from $200 up to
$10,000 a year and 62 percent of the workers with COLA.
   For union workers in non-manufacturing industries, only 10
percent get bonuses and 26 percent have COLA protections, the
government said.

   Convicted multiple killer John Wayne
Gacy has complained to state Republican officials about a campaign
leaflet that said he would be eligible for weekend passes had he
committed his crimes in Massachusetts.
   In a letter received Monday at state Republican headquarters,
Gacy criticized the GOP for ``exploiting the name of John Wayne Gacy
in order to scare people into voting for George Bush.''
   The letter said: ``Can't Bush run on his own record and the
truth, instead of all this scarey (sic) fantasy?''
   Gacy, imprisoned at the Menard Correctional Center in southern
Illinois, confirmed today that he wrote the letter, according to
Brian Fairchild, a spokesman for the state Department of Corrections.
   A slightly different version of the letter was mailed to The
Associated Press.
   Gacy was convicted in 1980 of killing 33 young men and boys, 29
of whom were found buried in his home in an unincorporated area near
Chicago. He was sentenced to death and his case is under appeal.
   The brochure Gacy cites was distributed by the state Republican
Party. It was labeled ``garbage'' earlier this month by
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the Democratic presidential
candidate.
   ``If John Wayne Gacy had committed his atrocious crimes in Boston
instead of Chicago, he would be eligible for weekend passes under
Michael Dukakis' furlough program,'' the leaflet said.
   Some convicted killers were granted furloughs during Dukakis'
administration, and the Bush campaign has made frequent reference to
one of them, Willie Horton, who subsequently raped a woman in
Maryland. The furlough program has since been changed to exclude
first-degree murderers.
   Stuart Piper, executive director of the state Republican Party,
said he was surprised by the letter.
   ``We didn't know if the letter was from (Gacy) and we didn't feel
that it dignified any public response,'' Piper said. ``Apparently,
he felt differently and released it to the media himself.''

   The government is wondering whether to give
folks who buy goods by telephone the same protections already
available to mail-order shoppers.
   The Federal Trade Commission several years ago set up
consumer-protection rules for people buying by mail. Among other
things those regulations require the seller to ship the product
within 30 days, unless the buyer agrees to a delay, and set rules
for refunds and other consumer protections.
   With telephone sales now growing enormously, the FTC announced
that it is considering extending the mail-order rules to include
telephone orders and other new telemarketing technologies.
   The agency is accepting public comments until Dec. 27. Interested
persons should write: Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking _

   Saying he was tired of being a ``mystery
man,'' the father of a 9-year-old girl came forward today and
disclosed that he's told his daughter of a Pennsylvania couple's
claim to be her rightful parents.
   The couple alleges the girl was born to them but was switched
with an ailing child soon after birth at a Florida hospital.
   Robert Mays, a 43-year-old salesman, held a news conference at
his lawyer's office and said he told his daughter Kimberly Michelle
about the case last week.
   Mays, who has remained silent while trying to protect his
daughter, said he was worried she might learn about the case from
someone else.
   ``I was tired of living a lie. ... I saw no reason to keep it
secret from her any longer,'' he said.
   Mays' name, which has been known to the media, had been
voluntarily withheld in published reports to protect the child. Mays
thanked reporters for their consideration.
   ``I had hoped this scenario would go some other way,'' Mays said,
adding that he has no reason to believe that Regina and Ernest Twigg
of Langhorne, Pa., will stop pursuing their claim.
   He said his daughter took the news of the months-long legal
battle very well.
   ``She's an intelligent little girl ... well-adjusted. She's a
totally loved child and well taken care of.'' The child's mother
died of cancer when she was 3{.
   The Twiggs maintain that their daughter, a healthy girl, was
deliberately switched in the nursery at Hardee Memorial Hospital in
Wauchula shortly after birth, and they were given a sickly child.
Hospital workers then altered records to hide the swap, they allege.
   The girl they raised, Arlena, died in August from a heart defect.
The Twiggs say Kimberly was born at Hardee Memorial in late 1978 at
about the same time as Arlena.
   The Twiggs say genetic tests this summer revealed Arlena was not
their biological daughter.
   They filed a $100 million suit against the hospital and some of
its employees and persuaded the FBI to investigate. The FBI,
however, failed to find sufficient evidence that federal laws had
been violated.
   The Twiggs have asked a court for genetic testing to determine if
Kimberly has the same blood type as theirs.
   Mays said he was reluctant to submit Kimberly to such a test
because of mere speculation. He said the Twiggs have presented no
evidence to show that Kimberly could be their daughter.
   When the whole situation began to unfold, Mays said he couldn't
believe it.
   ``I thought it was a terrible joke,'' he said today. ``It was
like a fairy tale. ... Only recently I've been honest enough with
myself to realize this isn't going to go away.''

   Michael Dukakis insisted today he is making ``real progress'' and
shrugged off a double-digit deficit in new polls. Republican George
Bush said his proposed capital gains tax cut is ``not a tax break
for the rich.''
   ``The pollsters are not going to call the election,'' Dukakis
said in a statement to reporters in Denver. ``It's people who are
going to be voting.''
   Dukakis met with Hispanic leaders in tossup Colorado before
traveling to Illinois.
   In Detroit, Bush defended his proposal to slash the capital gains
tax on profits from stocks, real estate and other assets from its
current level of 28 percent down to 15 percent. Dukakis has
denounced it as a tax break for the wealthy and said Bush personally
would reap a $22,000 advantage a year.
   ``It is not a tax break for the rich. It is a break for those who
want to have a job in this country and I am for it,'' Bush declared.
``Unfortunately, my opponent's only experience with business is
regulating it and taxing it.''
   President Reagan ventured into the Democratic stronghold of
Maryland and noted the Democrats' complaints about the negative tone
of the campaign.
   ``Well, I think they're squirming because George has shown
America how far outside the mainstream they really are,'' Reagan
said.
   Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle, in Florida
campaigning for Senate candidate Connie Mack III, talked as though
the election were over. He noted the difficulty of a White House
that has to deal with an opposition-controlled Congress. ``When
you're in the minority, the majority controls the gavel. They're
able to set the agenda in Congress,'' Quayle said.
   With less than two weeks remaining until Election Day, Dukakis
insisted in a late-night television interview Tuesday that there was
still time for him to overtake front-runner Bush.
   But when asked shortly after the program about polls showing him
trailing by 13 and 14 percentage points, the Democratic nominee
simply replied, ``Forging ahead.''
   In the 90-minute interview on ABC's ``Nightline,'' questioner Ted
Koppel asked Dukakis what Bush had done to ``nail your hide to the
wall thus far.'' The Democratic nominee failed to challenge Koppel's
assessment of the White House race before answering the question.
   ``Two things,'' Dukakis said. ``The Bush campaign made a very
careful and deliberate decision way back in the spring to run a
tough, attacking, negative campaign. And they've been doing it ever
since and perhaps I responded too late, perhaps I should have been
out there attacking or counterattacking from the beginning.''
   He also criticized Republican advertising and charged Bush with
running a campaign ``loaded with distortion and misrepresentation
and falsehoods.''
   Earlier Tuesday, Bush defended his campaign ads against the
Dukakis attacks.
   ``Because he was trying to run away from his record, I have
factually pointed out where he stands on the record,'' Bush said
during a campaign stop in Akron, Ohio. ``And I am not going to be
deterred. I am going to keep doing that honestly, factually.''
   The vice president, targeting a must-win Dukakis state, told an
audience in Lima, Ohio, that the election is a referendum on peace
and prosperity and that Dukakis is too inexperienced to be president.
   ``We cannot gamble America's future on a president who hasn't had
one single day's experience in national defense matters or foreign
affairs,'' Bush said.
   Polls released Tuesday suggested that the Democratic ticket faces
a difficult task in its quest for the White House.
   A CBS News-New York Times survey of 1,287 probable voters showed
Bush leading Dukakis 54-41 percent while a Gallup poll of 815 likely
voters showed Bush up by 14 points, 53-39 percent.
   The CBS-Times poll was conducted Friday through Monday and had a
margin of error of three points. The Gallup survey was done Friday
through Sunday and had a four-point error margin.
   As part of their uphill fight, the Dukakis campaign released four
new TV ads which ask voters to imagine a world where children can
play without fear of drug dealers, where the elderly are no longer a
burden, where a single paycheck pays the bills and where America is
No. 1 in competition on foreign markets.
   All four ads end with the phrase, ``Dukakis-Bentsen. The best
America is yet to come.''
   The ads are scheduled to begin airing on Thursday in spot markets
around the country, said Dukakis spokeswoman Lorraine Voles.
   The Bush campaign also released an ad alleging that Dukakis
misled 62 million Americans when he denied during the last
presidential debate that he raided his state pension system to
balance the budget.
   The ad's narrator concludes: ``And Michael Dukakis says George
Bush is running a campaign of lies? Michael Dukakis is
unbelievable.''
   Bush aides said they did not know where or when the commercials
will air.
   In addition to advertising, the Dukakis campaign is filling the
airwaves with none other than Dukakis and Bentsen. The Democratic
nominee will appear on the ``CBS Evening News'' Thursday for a
14-minute interview with Dan Rather and also appear on NBC with
anchor Tom Brokaw for a series next week on the candidate's
positions.
   Bentsen is scheduled to appear on the CBS program tonight. The
Dukakis campaign also had bought five minutes of time on the network
Sunday night for a spot the Texas senator will likely tape today in
Los Angeles.
   Bentsen kept up his attack Tuesday on what he called GOP
distortions of the Democratic record.
   ``The kind of campaign these Republicans are waging would tear
the heart out of a democracy,'' he told a rally in Great Falls, Mont.

   The Atlanta Journal on Wednesday endorsed
Republican George Bush for president, arguing that the vice
president represents ``leadership with proven results in foreign
policy, at the pay window and at income tax time.''
   The Journal's sister newspaper, The Atlanta Constitution, last
week endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis.
   The Journal said Bush and Dukakis offer the voters a choice
between ``experience and experimentation and between proven values
and those rejected in the last two national elections.''
   ``Values and leadership put a stamp on a candidacy,'' the
newspaper said. ``George Bush has been principled and consistent.
His uncompromising stands against crime and for the enhancement of
families contrast well with liberal social experimentation.''

news.
   ``She laughed and said a lot of people are born with a silver

   Republican George Bush today portrayed Michael
Dukakis as the odd man out in opposing a reduction in capital gains
taxes, and said his Democratic opponent is ``just itching to
repeal'' income tax cuts enacted in President Reagan's first term.
   Fortified by new polls showing him with a double-digit lead, the
vice president attacked Dukakis at a luncheon sponsored by the
Detroit Economic Club and the Women's Economic Club.
   Playing it safe, Bush stuck to time-tested themes.
   The GOP nominee has proposed slashing the capital gains tax on
profits from stocks, real estate and other assets from its current
top of 33 percent to 15 percent. Dukakis denounced it as a tax break
for the wealthy and said it would give Bush himself a $22,000 tax
break annually.
   Defending his plan as a way to spur investments and create jobs,
Bush said, ``Over the years, it's been endorsed by everyone from
John F. Kennedy to Lloyd Bentsen to my running mate, Dan Quayle, to
Ronald Reagan and George Bush.'' Bentsen is Dukakis' vice
presidential running mate.
   ``It is not a tax break for the rich. It is a break for those who
want to have a job in this country and I am for it,'' Bush said.
   ``Unfortunately, my opponent's only experience with business is
regulating it and taxing it,'' Bush said. ``He's never run a
business. He's never started a business. He's never met a payroll.
He doesn't understand how when you're starting out, you need people
to join you in taking risks. So he paints my proposal as an effort
to help the rich.''
   ``Wrong,'' Bush told his audience of 1,600 people.
   The vice president also said that since Reagan took office in
1981, the administration has cut personal income tax rates by an
average 27 percent.
   He said there has been an undeniable link between low taxes and
economic growth.
   Bush said Dukakis was asked during the Democratic primary race if
he would repeal the 1981 tax cuts. He said Dukakis shrugged his
shoulders and called the tax cut ``one of the worse bills that
Congress every could have passed'' and ``a government-made
disaster.''
   Bush said, ``Those sound to me like the words of someone who is
just itching to repeal one of the most successful economic policies
in our history, and I know why. He has proposed mandated new
spending, both by government and by business, that will cost ...
billions and billions and billions.''
   He said that if elected on Nov. 8, he will tell Congress that
``the American people, in electing me, voted against a tax
increase'' and that instead, spending increases should be limited to
the inflation rate.
   Bush told a GOP barbecue in Lima, Ohio, on Monday that the
election was about keeping the country strong economically and
militarily.
   ``We cannot gamble America's future on a president who hasn't had
one single day's experience in national defense matters or foreign
affairs,'' Bush said, winning cheers from the audience.
   A handful of hecklers shouted noisily at him during his speech,
and Bush said, ``I'm glad they're here.''
   He urged the audience to ask the protesters how high interest
rates and inflation were during the last Democratic administration,
and then supplied the answers _ 21 percent for the former and in
double digits for the latter.
   Working his way toward the battleground state of California,
where he will campaign later this week, Bush planned stops today at
rallies at a stockyard in Sioux Falls, S.D., and at a high school in
Billings, Mont. In the evening, he was flying to Tacoma, Wash., to
campaign there Thursday morning.
   Whereas Michigan offers the prospect of 20 electoral votes, South
Dakota has only three and Montana has only four. However, all three
states are on Dukakis' blueprint for reaching the 270 needed to win
the White House, so Bush is doing his best to keep them out of the
Democratic column.
   His campaign was bouyed Tuesday by news of two new polls
indicating that Bush has solidified his lead in the two weeks since
the last presidential debate.
   A CBS News-New York Times poll showed Bush with a 13-point
advantage, 54-41 percent, while a Gallup poll showed Bush with a
14-point edge, 53-39 percent.
   With things going his way, Bush stuck to a familiar theme
Tuesday: hammering Dukakis about the economy during stops in Ohio in
Canton, Columbus and Lima.

   Zambians voted Wednesday in elections
expected to reaffirm support for the nation's founding father, whose
popularity remains high despite severe economic problems.
   President Kenneth Kaunda, who led the British colony to
independence Oct. 24, 1964, needed 51 percent of ballots cast to
serve another five years. Of Kenya's 7 million people, 2.6 million
are registered to vote.
   Also up for election were the 125 seats in the National Assembly.
Zambians had to decide from 609 candidates from the United National
Independence Party.
   Voters chose between two symbols _ picking an eagle if they
wanted to vote for Kaunda, or choosing a frog to vote against him.
This is to accommodate illiterate voters.
   The last election was held in October 1983, when Kaunda won his
fifth five-year term.
   Most observers believed that despite pressures for economic
reforms, most voters would cast their ballot for Kaunda.
   ``I will go by what the people say,'' said Kaunda, 64, after
casting his ballot. ``This is exactly what we fought for. It is the
meaning of independence.''
   He said the elections should inspire voteless people in South
Africa and in South-West Africa, or Namibia, which is ruled by South
Africa.
   The congress of the United National Independence Party has
routinely nominated Kaunda the sole candidate since independence,
although it is free to choose more than one. New elections are held
if the sole candidate loses.
   Analysts expected a low turnout for the sixth post-independence
elections, but long lines had formed outside some polling stations
in the capital, Lusaka, before voting began at 6 a.m.
   Rural Zambians went to the polls by bus, bicycle, tractor and on
foot. In some areas, voters paddled canoes to the booths. In the
Mpika district of Central province, where roads are impassable
because of heavy rains, voters were ferried by helicopters.
   But Zambian reporters in several rural areas said polling was
slow and there were small lines outside most booths.
   When Kaunda led Zambia to independence, his people enjoyed one of
the highest standards of living in Africa, thanks largely to high
world prices for copper which earns 90 percent of export income.
   But when prices slumped in the 1970s, a time when landlocked
Zambia had transformed from food exporter to importer, the nation's
fortunes changed. The foreign debt mounted and today stands at $5
billion.
   Most foreign donors have stopped helping Zambia since Kaunda last
year abandoned an economic recovery program proposed by the
International Monetary Fund.

<TEXT>
   A New York prosecutor on Wednesday urged West
German Ambassador Jurgen Ruhfus to help bring to justice a man who
fled the United States while awaiting deportation as a suspected
Nazi war criminal.
   Brooklyn District Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman said she told the
ambassador there was great concern in the United States that
Boleslav Maikovskis would ``slip through the cracks'' of the West
German judicial system.
   Maikovskis, 83, left the United States last year after the U.S.
Supreme Court ruled him eligible for deportation for his alleged
involvement in Nazi atrocities during World War II, including the
burning of a village in Latvia and the shooting of women and
children.
   In 1965, the Soviet Union sentenced Maikovskis to death in
absentia. He could have been deported to the Soviet Union, in the
wake of refusals in recent years by both Switzerland and West
Germany to take him, but former Attorney General Edwin Meese refused
to designate the Soviet Union as his destination.
   Holtzman said Ruhfus told her authorities in West Germany had
only found out that Maikovskis was living there several weeks ago
when the matter was first made public in the U.S. media.
   The Justice Department has also said it was unaware Maikovskis
fled the country for West Germany, where he has sought political
asylum.
   Holtzman said it was unclear to her whether local authorities in
the town of Dortmund knew of Maikovskis' presence and his suspected
Nazi past until the matter became public.
   Authorities in West Germany earlier this month detained
Maikovskis and launched an investigation of his past in connection
with the murder charges leveled against him by the Soviets.
   Holtzman indicated she believed Maikovskis had received some
assurances from West German authorities that he would be safe in
their country. ``Otherwise why would he go to a country that has
refused in the past to accept his deportation from the United
States?'' she said.
   West Germany and Switzerland both refused to accept Maikovskis
after the Justice Department initially ordered him deported in 1984.
   Meese refused to designate the Soviet Union as the country for
Maikovskis' deportation even though the Soviets had expressed great
interest in bringing him to trial.
   ``Meese violated the law by failing to act on the court's
determination that Maikovskis should be deported from the United
States,'' Holtzman said.
   The German ambassador promised to keep Holtzman informed of steps
being taken against Maikovskis and to convey to the Bonn government
``the strong interest here that Maikovskis not go unpunished,''
Holtzman said.

   A British television program claimed three French
gangsters assassinated President John F. Kennedy on a contract from
U.S. organized crime, but French records show two of them were not
in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.
   One of the three men, Sauveur Pironti, also denied the allegation
in an interview published Wednesday by the Marseilles newspaper Le
Provencal.
   It quoted him as saying ``I was not in Dallas, but in the
military in Toulon,'' and said he displayed a military service
record showing he was based on a mine sweeper in Toulon from Oct.
16, 1962, to April 16, 1964.
   ``I believe at that time my friend Sarti was being held in
Baumettes (prison in Marseilles) and (Roger) Bocagnani was in prison
at Fort du Ha in Bordeaux,'' the newspaper quoted Pironti as saying.
   According to the two-hour Central Television program ``The Men
Who Killed Kennedy,'' broadcast Tuesday night, Lucien Sarti was was
shot to death in Mexico in 1972 and Bocagnani is believed to be
working in the Colombian cocaine trade.
   French Navy headquarters confirmed the dates of service in Toulon
and said Pironti, 46, could not have been in Dallas on the day of
the assassination. The Justice Ministry said Bocagnani was in a jail
cell in Marseille on that day.
   Kennedy was killed as he rode in a motorcade through Dallas. Lee
Harvey Oswald was charged with the shooting, but Jack Ruby shot and
killed him two days later. The Warren Commission said Oswald acted
alone in the assassination.
   There have been many theories over the years that Oswald was not
the killer or was part of a conspiracy in which assorted
organizations, governments and personalities were involved.
   Central Television, a company in Britain's commercial Independent
Television network, said its report was based on a four-year inquiry
by Steve Rivele, an American writer and researcher, and Nigel
Turner, the documentary's British director.
   Rivele said the three men were hired through organized crime
circles on the French Mediterranean island of Corsica, but the
program produced no direct evidence of a Corsican connection.
   According to Rivele, he got on the Corsican trail by interviewing
Christian David, a French drug smuggler held at the Leavenworth
federal prison in Kansas.
   In exchange for help in hiring an attorney, Rivele said, David
told him he was offered the contract and refused it, then gradually
revealed the identities of those involved.
   The American journalist said he persuaded a contact in the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Agency, not identified, to give him someone who
could corroborate David's story. He identified that man as Michel
Nicoli, a government witness living under a false identity.
   Nicoli, interviewed with his face obscured, said he heard Sarti,
Bocagnoni and Pironti were the killers in 1966, when he lived in
Buenos Aires. He said he believed it to be true but gave no
indication that he had direct evidence of their involvement.
   David's lawyer was interviewed and said the his client had given
him a sealed envelope to be opened only if he was freed.
   Le Provencal said Pironti, a Corsican, has lived in Marseilles
since his release four years ago after a prison term for drug
smuggling.
   It quoted him as saying he spoke for Sarti and Bocagnani, ``and I
can tell you that if they were in Marseille they would be with me
here tonight. This business ... is the most incredible misadventure
of my life.''

   East Germany has imprisoned 1,800 political
prisoners in the past 12 months, a West Berlin watchdog group said
Wednesday.
   The Working Group August 13, which keeps tabs on trends in East
Germany, also said that of those imprisoned ``600 had been released
to resettle in West Germany.''
   The group is named after the date in 1961 when construction of
the Berlin Wall began.
   It said ``most of those imprisoned were accused of attempting to
flee the country, violation of state and social order, or unlawful
contacts and forming of mobs.''
   The report also said that 750,000 East Germans have applied to
leave the country for West Germany. So far this year, 20,000 people
had been permitted to resettle in the West, it said.

   Republican George Bush today portrayed Michael
Dukakis as the odd man out in opposing a reduction in capital gains
taxes, and said his Democratic opponent is ``just itching to
repeal'' income tax cuts enacted in President Reagan's first term.
   Fortified by new polls showing him with a double-digit lead, the
vice president attacked Dukakis at a luncheon sponsored by the
Detroit Economic Club and the Women's Economic Club.
   Playing it safe, Bush stuck to time-tested themes.
   The GOP nominee has proposed slashing the capital gains tax on
profits from stocks, real estate and other assets from its current
top of 33 percent to 15 percent. Dukakis denounced it as a tax break
for the wealthy and said it would give Bush himself a $22,000 tax
break annually.
   Defending his plan as a way to spur investments and create jobs,
Bush said, ``Over the years, it's been endorsed by everyone from
John F. Kennedy to Lloyd Bentsen to my running mate, Dan Quayle, to
Ronald Reagan and George Bush.'' Bentsen is Dukakis' vice
presidential running mate.
   ``It is not a tax break for the rich. It is a break for those who
want to have a job in this country and I am for it,'' Bush said.
   ``Unfortunately, my opponent's only experience with business is
regulating it and taxing it,'' Bush said. ``He's never run a
business. He's never started a business. He's never met a payroll.
He doesn't understand how when you're starting out, you need people
to join you in taking risks. So he paints my proposal as an effort
to help the rich.''
   ``Wrong,'' Bush told his audience of 1,600 people.
   The vice president also said that since Reagan took office in
1981, the administration has cut personal income tax rates by an
average 27 percent.
   He said there has been an undeniable link between low taxes and
economic growth.
   Bush said Dukakis was asked during the Democratic primary race if
he would repeal the 1981 tax cuts. He said Dukakis shrugged his
shoulders and called the tax cut ``one of the worse bills that
Congress every could have passed'' and ``a government-made
disaster.''
   Bush said, ``Those sound to me like the words of someone who is
just itching to repeal one of the most successful economic policies
in our history, and I know why. He has proposed mandated new
spending, both by government and by business, that will cost ...
billions and billions and billions.''
   He said that if elected on Nov. 8, he will tell Congress that
``the American people, in electing me, voted against a tax
increase'' and that instead, spending increases should be limited to
the inflation rate.
   Bush told a GOP barbecue in Lima, Ohio, on Monday that the
election was about keeping the country strong economically and
militarily.
   ``We cannot gamble America's future on a president who hasn't had
one single day's experience in national defense matters or foreign
affairs,'' Bush said, winning cheers from the audience.
   A handful of hecklers shouted noisily at him during his speech,
and Bush said, ``I'm glad they're here.''
   He urged the audience to ask the protesters how high interest
rates and inflation were during the last Democratic administration,
and then supplied the answers _ 21 percent for the former and in
double digits for the latter.
   Working his way toward the battleground state of California,
where he will campaign later this week, Bush planned stops today at
rallies at a stockyard in Sioux Falls, S.D., and at a high school in
Billings, Mont. In the evening, he was flying to Tacoma, Wash., to
campaign there Thursday morning.
   Whereas Michigan offers the prospect of 20 electoral votes, South
Dakota has only three and Montana has only four. However, all three
states are on Dukakis' blueprint for reaching the 270 needed to win
the White House, so Bush is doing his best to keep them out of the
Democratic column.
   His campaign was bouyed Tuesday by news of two new polls
indicating that Bush has solidified his lead in the two weeks since
the last presidential debate.
   A CBS News-New York Times poll showed Bush with a 13-point
advantage, 54-41 percent, while a Gallup poll showed Bush with a
14-point edge, 53-39 percent.
   With things going his way, Bush stuck to a familiar theme
Tuesday: hammering Dukakis about the economy during stops in Ohio in
Canton, Columbus and Lima.

   Breaking with a 70-year-old tradition, the
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists declared
Wednesday that women who have had a baby by Caesarean section
generally should deliver subsequent children by normal, vaginal
birth.
   The new guidelines say such mothers should be encouraged by their
doctors to choose normal delivery and that even those who have had
two or more babies by C-section should receive support for
attempting a vaginal delivery if that is their choice.
   The incidence of Caesarean delivery has skyrocketed over the past
two decades, prompting many government and health leaders to pay
closer attention to the risk and cost of such procedures balanced
against natural delivery.
   In 1987, for example, 24.4 percent of the 3.8 million births
recorded in the United States were by Caesarean delivery _ compared
with 5.5 percent of the 3.7 million births recorded in 1970.
   Of the 934,000 Caesarean deliveries in 1987, the College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists estimated that 35 percent were
performed not because of a demonstrated medical need, but merely
because the mother had previously delivered by Caesarean.
   ``This is the first time in over 70 years we are saying that a
patient who has had a C-section should not have a repeat C-section
unless there is a defiite medical need,'' said Dr. Mary Jo
O'Sullivan, a member of the panel that developed the new guidelines.
   She emphasized that the recommendation applies only to
low-transverse, horizontal C-sections _ sometimes referred to by
women as the bikini cut _ used 99 percent of the time.
   For those 1 percent of mothers who have had the classical
vertical incision, the recommendation holds for using a C-section in
subsequent deliveries to miminize the risk of a rupture of the
uterus along the scar from the previous incision.
   If the new guidelines are embraced by U.S. hospitals, they will
go far toward ending the ``once a C-section, always a C-section''
tradition that has guided obstetric practice since 1916, said
O'Sullivan, who is chief of obstetrics and gynecology at the
University of Miami medical school in Florida.
   She declined to offer a reason for the sharp rise in C-sections
in recent years. But she acknowledged that some doctors may
encourage them because they can charge more than for normal
delivery, and also said ``many women do not want the pain of labor.''
   According to government statistics, the average doctor and
hospital charge in 1986 was $2,620 for a normal delivery and $4,330
for a C-section.
   In an interview, O'Sullivan said she hopes that a woman who has
undergone C-sections and meets guideline criteria for trying a
vaginal delivery in subsequent births will consider switching
physicians if her present one is not sympathetic to her desires.
   On the other hand, she said she hoped that physicians who
subscribe to the guidelines would counsel their patients to switch
to another doctor if they are determined from the earliest weeks of
pregnancy to have a C-section regardless of whether it is medically
indicated.
   The shift of position outlined Wednesday stems from an
accumulation of statistical data that has established that _
everything else being equal _ mother and baby generally fare better
with vaginal delivery than a C-section even if the mother has
previously had a low transverse C-section, O'Sullivan said.
   Not only are C-sections significantly more costly than natural
delivery, they raise the prospect of the same type of potential
complications attendant any major surgery, such as infections and
reactions to anesthesia.
   The study found that women who have had a C-section by the
low-transverse method were successful in subsequent vaginal delivery
attempts in most cases.
   ``Up to 70 percent of these women who had their first Caesarean
birth because of failure to progress in a long and difficult labor
were able to deliver vaginally with their second child,'' Dr.
O'Sullivan said.
   C-sections would continue to be used for such complications as
breech births, when there are signs that the baby is in distress or
following a difficult and prolonged attempt at labor.

<HEAD>Military Considering Civilians To Head `Stars & Stripes' Newspapers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department, bracing for charges of
censorship at the Stars & Stripes military newspapers, is debating a
significant shift in structure that would put civilian journalists
at the top of the masthead instead of military officers.
   Pentagon officials say no final decision has been made to ditch
the existing organizational system. But the officials say there
appears to be fairly uniform agreement ``that something has to be
done.''
   ``We don't want to fold these papers; there's nothing out there
to replace them,'' explained one official, who spoke only on
condition of anonymity. ``So you've got to consider ways to
strengthen editorial control and dampen charges of censorship.''
   The sources said Wednesday they expected a decision on the future
of the newspapers to be made soon _ perhaps within the next week _
because the Pentagon is facing a deadline for responding to a draft
study of the newspapers by the General Accounting Office.
   That report by Congress' watchdog agency, while still in
preliminary form, is described by officials who have read it as
quite critical of the newspapers' operation.
   It finds ``overwhelming evidence'' of military censorship at one
of the two papers, the Pacific edition of Stars & Stripes, one
source said.
   ``The best way to respond to the GAO would be to tell them we're
already changing things around,'' another source said.
   The GAO investigation was launched early this year at the behest
of Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., who persuaded Congress to demand
an inquiry into `allegations of censorship by military commanders of
the Department of Defense newspaper, Stars and Stripes.''
   In demanding the investigation, Proxmire blasted the Pentagon for
sending soldiers overseas to protect freedom while denying them
``one of the most important freedoms that we have in this country _
that is the right to a free press under the First Amendment.''
   Although frequently referred to as one newspaper, the Stars and
Stripes is published in two separate editions by largely autonomous
bureaus in West Germany and Japan. Designed to serve as the
``hometown paper'' for American military personnel posted overseas,
the papers have a long history that dates to publication in France
during World War I.
   The papers are staffed by military as well as civilian
journalists, but both papers are led by an officer who holds the
title of commander and editor-in-chief. Those officers, in turn,
must answer to the heads of the European and Pacific commands.
   The Pentagon describes the papers as ``authorized, but unofficial
publications.'' Both operate under a charter to provide ``a free
flow of news and information ... without censorship or news
management.''
   In reality, however, reporters who have worked for the papers say
they always walk a tightrope between reporting the news and
satisfying military commanders worried about upsetting the host
country.
   Examples of the problem are among those that prompted Proxmire to
demand an investigation. There have been persistent reports the
Pacific edition of Stars & Stripes killed stories on the results of
AIDS testing and the fact that some military wives were working in
Japan as bar hostesses.
   According to the sources, the GAO reviewed those and other cases
of alleged censorship, then asked an advisory panel from the Sigma
Delta Chi professional journalism fraternity to help characterize
the handling of each story as either typical news judgment or
censorship.
   ``SDX didn't characterize all of the GAO cases as censorship, and
quite frankly that lends credibility to the report,'' one source
said. ``But there is overwhelming evidence of censorship,
overwhelming.''

<HEAD>Kahane Gets Court OK To Make U.S. Speaking Tour</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge ruled Wednesday that
Brooklyn-born Rabbi Meir Kahane can travel here from Israel for a
speaking tour while he challenges a government finding that he had
renounced his U.S. citizenship.
   U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker ordered the State
Department not to interfere with Kahane's plan to enter the United
States early Thursday to begin a three-week speaking tour at a
suburban Washington synagogue.
   Parker made the ruling at the conclusion of a 90-minute hearing
during which an attorney for Kahane argued that the founder of the
militant Jewish Defense League only renounced his U.S. citizenship
to retain his seat in the Knesset, the Israeli parliament.
   Attorney Nathan Lewin maintained that Kahane only signed
renunciation papers when faced with the ``Hobson's choice'' of
losing his seat in the Knesset or losing his American citizenship.
   Kahane, also an Israeli citizen, renounced his American
citizenship to comply with a new Israeli law that prohibits Knesset
members from being citizens of other nations.
   Kahane sent a telegram to withdraw the renunciation after the
Israeli Supreme Court ruled his anti-Arab political party was racist
and therefore ineligible to partcipate in the Nov. 1 parliamentary
election.
   The law requiring Kahane to renounce his U.S. citizenship to keep
his parliamentary seat was ``a figurative gun at his head,'' Lewin
said.
   ``Did he cross his fingers when he signed the oath?'' the judge
said.
   Lewin replied that Kahane issued a public statement explaining
the reason for his renunciation and filed a written version with
U.S. Embassy officials when he signed the oath.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael L. Martinez argued that Kahane
``knew exactly what he was doing. It was a voluntary choice.''
   He cited several court cases in which Americans who had renounced
their nationality to qualify for jobs in foreign countries were not
allowed later to reclaim their citizenship.
   ``He has affirmatively gone in to renounce his citizenship. Not
being a citizen anymore, he has no right to come into this country
on a U.S. passport,'' Martinez said. ``He knew what the consequences
of his choice were _ therefore it was voluntary.''
   Martinez noted that because Kahane had signed the incorrect form
on Aug. 16 he returned to the Tel Aviv embassy in September and
``for a second time renounced his citizenship by filling out the
correct papers.''
   Lewin said Kahane should not be stripped of his citizenship
rights until the court rules on whether his renunciation was valid.
   ``They don't have a constitutional right to take something away
from him as precious as citizenship without an adversary hearing,''
Lewin said.
   He accused the State Department of trying to muzzle Kahane, whose
extremist views have been the focus of controversy both here and in
Israel.
   ``Because Meir Kahane is a notorious figure and people know about
him, the State Department is taking a strong line,'' Lewin said.
``They don't want him here.''
   ``Whether they agreed or disagree with him, this is a country
where he has a right to come and speak,'' Lewin said.
   Four years ago, a federal judge rejected the State Department's
claim that Kahane had renounced his citizenship by taking a seat in
the Knesset.

   Dan Quayle courted voters in the pro-Republican
Cuban community of Florida on Wednesday, stumped for a GOP Senate
candidate and told high school students that ``today we're happy and
tomorrow we're going to be even happier.''
   The Republican vice presidential nominee touted the prospects for
a rosy future at a space and missile contractor's plant in Tampa,
Fla., before a heavily Cuban audience at Miami High School and at an
outdoor rally in the ``Little Havana'' section of Miami.
   Quayle was cheered loudly at the high school, especially when he
mentioned the school's band and basketball and football teams, in a
rambling speech about education, drugs and the future.
   The students buzzed when the 41-year-old Indiana senator said
prenatal care and adoption should be options if a teen-age girl
becomes pregnant. He said he and GOP presidential candidate George
Bush were committed to good jobs and education.
   ``A job is opportunity. A job is hope. A job is a chance of being
able to go out and produce for yourself and your family,'' Quayle
said.
   ``And that future, which is your future, and I want you to join
with me and George Bush in working for that future _ that future
where people are looking up, that future where people are smiling,
that future where people are working, that future where people are
producing ...
   ``What you do in this city in this state at this time,'' he said,
``that future, because of your work, because of your commitment to
the cause, will be better, will be brighter. We'll let the sunshine
come in to shine on us because today we're happy and tomorrow we'll
be even happier.''
   Quayle later modified his usual stump speech with one-liners
intended to appeal to the anti-communist sentiments of his audience
outside the Little Havana Activities and Nutrition Centers of Dade
County.
   He promised that he and Bush ``will invest in our people, quality
education, job opportunities, family, neighborhood and, yes, a thing
we call America. A thing we call America because this country is
still the beacon of hope for millions around the world.''
   Quayle began the day at a fund-raising breakfast in Tampa for
Republican Rep. Connie Mack III, who is locked in a close battle
against Rep. Buddy MacKay, D-Fla., for the Senate seatbeing vacated
by Lawton Chiles Jr., a Democrat.
   ``I know that Florida is going to vote for George Bush on Nov.
8,'' Quayle said. But he said Bush had asked him to deliver the
message that he wants Mack as ``a partner in the U.S. Senate.''
   GOP officials said Quayle will be making more such appearances on
behalf of Senate candidates in New Jersey, Ohio and Wisconsin.
   Reporters asked Quayle about a new CBS News_New York Times poll
showing that he is the least popular among the four candidates on
the Republican and Democratic tickets this fall.
   Quayle replied that Dukakis is ``the person that is unpopular in
America ... he's dragging his ticket down.''
   As for whether his presence on the GOP ticket might be hurting
Bush, the senator said, ``As a matter of fact when we got on this
ticket, we were double digits behind, and we're doing quite well.''

   The Soviet Union said Wednesday it will launch its
space shuttle Buran on an unmanned mission this week, following
months of delays similar to those that plagued the maiden voyage of
its U.S. counterpart.
   A government commission set the launch for 6:23 a.m. Moscow time
Saturday (11:23 p.m. EDT Friday) after receiving reports from
specialists following several thousand tests of the Buran and its
booster rocket, the Energia, the official news agency Tass reported.
   ``Buran'' is Russian for snowstorm, an appropriate name since the
first snow of the season fell this week in Moscow.
   Preparations for pouring nearly 2,000 tons of liquid hydrogen,
oxygen and hydrocarbon fuel into Energia, billed as the world's most
powerful booster rocket, are to begin Thursday, Tass said. The
rocket is capable of carrying more than 100 tons of cargo into Earth
orbit, and up to 20 tons to the planets Mars and Venus.
   State-run television on Wednesday showed the white delta-shaped
Buran, with its name emblazoned in red, attached to the Energia on a
launch pad at the Soviet Union's Baikonur Cosmodrome on the Central
Asian steppes of the republic of Kazakhstan.
   Launch was originally planned for the first half of this year,
but was postponed as technical problems arose, officials said. A
Soviet TV announcer indicated Wednesday the launch time could be
pushed back because tests of systems may take longer than
anticipated.
   ``The 29th of October is a day when confidence, hopes and fears
will be confirmed or refuted,'' the announcer said.
   The maiden flight of the U.S. shuttle Columbia in 1981 was
postponed many times because of technical snags.
   Soviet officials have said the first flight would be pilotless to
prevent accidents like the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion of the U.S.
shuttle Challenger. Seven astronauts were killed in that blast.
   Soviet media did not say how long Buran's mission would last. If
the test flight is successful, a mission with two cosmonauts is to
follow, but Soviet officials have not said when.
   On Sept. 29, Tass said the first mission was planned ``to conduct
a comprehensive flight test of the spaceship's design and its
on-board systems without a crew on board during liftoff, in orbit
and during automatic landing as well as to continue upgrading the
booster rocket and ground flight control aids.''
   The Soviet shuttle program has been shrouded in secrecy since it
began in 1982, and Soviet Foreign Ministry officials said Wednesday
foreign reporters would not be allowed to travel to Baikonur for the
launch.
   What little information the Soviets have given about the shuttle
has appeared timed for political purposes, to highlight the
capabilities of their manned space program as measured against the
American counterpart.
   Tass transmitted the first pictures of the Soviet shuttle on
Sept. 29, at about the same time the U.S. shuttle Discovery was
launched from Cape Canaveral, Fla. The Discovery mission marked a
return of the American manned space program after a 2{-year
suspension caused by the Challenger accident.
   The Soviets may also use the test flight to highlight what they
claim is the peaceful nature of their space program. The next U.S.
shuttle, the Atlantis, will be launched in November and is to carry
a military payload.

   Christa McAuliffe's husband and parents
Wednesday helped break ground for a pyramid-shaped planetarium
honoring the teacher killed along with six other astronauts aboard
the space shuttle Challenger.
   ``She was the most humble of persons. She would be embarrassed to
have her name on a building,'' said Steven McAuliffe, who said his
wife believed she was representing all teachers in the space program.
   About 1,000 people gathered on frost-covered grass at the New
Hampshire Technical Institute: teachers and school officials from
Concord as well as children and other residents caught up in the
excitement that led to Challenger's flight and the grief that
followed its destruction on Jan. 28, 1986.
   The $2.6 million planetarium is expected to be dedicated in
January 1990. During the day the glass exterior will reflect the
clouds _ at night the moon and stars.
   The key feature will be a computer projection system that
simulates space travel and shows the sky's changes over 2 million
years.
   Visitors under the 40-foot dome will experience the sights of
moving through space or view the night sky as if they were part of a
lunar expedition and watch the Earth rise.
   The project was selected from about 100 suggestions for a state
memorial, a choice McAuliffe praised. ``I can't imagine a more
appropriate, a more fitting memorial,'' he said.
   Her parents, Ed and Grace Corrigan of Framingham, Mass., wielded
shovels in a line of dignitaries.
   ``She would be very pleased that something like this is ongoing
and such a positive thing for education,'' Mrs. Corrigan said. ``I
just wish she were here with us.''

<HEAD>Supreme Soviet Faces Budget Issue Thursday</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Soviet parliament will confront a dilemma when
it convenes Thursday: the need to slash an enormous budget deficit
while soothing public anger over empty store shelves.
   The 1,500 deputies of the Supreme Soviet typically sit through
hours of numbing speeches in their two-day autumn session before
unanimously approving the annual budget and development plan.
   This time, with the example of June's vociferous Communist Party
conference telling them glasnost has ripped the economic veil,
Western diplomats predict the deputies may actually offer some
candid comments on the Kremlin's economic plan.
   They also might comment on Gorbachev's proposal for
multiple-candidate elections to a new Congress of People's Deputies,
although the reform laws published last weekend are scheduled for
consideration at a separate Supreme Soviet meeting in November.
   Thursday's session will be the first to deal openly with what the
government acknowledges is a serious budget deficit. Tass, the
official news agency, says that problem ``was passed over in silence
previously.''
   Some analysts say that deficit could be as high as $100 billion
due to a combination of problems ranging from the cleanup of the
Chernobyl nuclear disaster to lost revenues from curtailed vodka
sales.
   Simultaneously, the Soviet Union is trying to fill its
chronically empty food shelves and stop the periodic disappearance
of everyday necessities. Among items unavailable in most Moscow
stores are laundry detergent, razor blades and deodorant.
   The leadership already has made one hard decision: investment in
heavy industry will be sharply cut back in 1989 in order to finance
purchase of more consumer goods. When President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
visited the Siberian city of Krasnayarsk last month, he was besieged
by angry citizens complaining of shortages.
   For the Soviet Union, where heavy industry has been the favored
child for decades, and where Josef Stalin once seriously argued that
chronic shortages of consumer goods fueled economic growth, this is
a radical turnabout.
   The Tass report says the 1989 plan calls for 6 percent growth in
consumer goods versus 2.5 percent in heavy industry. Western
economists point out that the Soviet Union may never achieve these
goals, but the comparative projections imply a dramatic shift in
underlying investment.
   For example, a recently completed tractor factory is being
converted to passenger car production.
   Still, the tasks are daunting. To fulfill Gorbachev's promise
that every family will have its own apartment by the year 2000, he
needs a crash construction program in an industry legendary for
endless delays and careless workmanship.
   Even those with sufficient space may find themselves in the 10
percent of Moscow's housing that lacks hot water and central heat in
a city where the temperature drops below freezing six months out of
the year.
   Gorbachev's best hope for solving the shortages is found in the
incredible waste now blamed on central planning. For example, at a
recent agricultural conference, a farmer complained to Gorbachev
that he was left without fuel at harvest time because too much oil
has been sold for hard currency to buy grain.
   Gorbachev himself said more than 25 percent of the nation's
harvest is lost by rotting en route to the stores.
   For cutting the budget, Gorbachev appears to be relying on his
plan to shift to more productive work as much as half of the bloated
bureaucracy, a mass that numbers somewhere between 18 million and 30
million people.
   He also is counting on modern _ and largely Western _ technology
to increase productivity in manufacturing. In the first nine months
of this year, 1 million factory jobs were eliminated, a statistic
announced with pride in a nation that once pointed to layoffs as
being among the horrors of capitalism.
   The government statistician who revealed that figure said
one-third of those workers retired and the other two-thirds found
positions in service industries or the new private cooperatives.
   The looming question in solving the deficit, however, is the same
one facing the United States: Will the Soviet Union cut its defense
budget?
   The West, not to mention the Soviet public, may never know.
Soviet military expenditures are scattered throughout the national
budget, and the official line item is a fraction of the true total,
estimated by the CIA at about 15 percent of the total Soviet economy.
   All these challenges are coming at a time of radicial change in
the structure of the Soviet economy.
   For example, the development plan before the legislature calls
for most new machinery, textiles, ceramics and shoes to be sold on
an open market for the first time in more than half a century. The
ministries for machine-building and light industry, which
traditionally set quotas for those goods, would control only a
fraction of production.
   Western diplomats, speaking on the condition they not be
identified, said such issues could produce fireworks at the usually
staid Supreme Soviet.
   In the four weeks since he slammed through a reorganization of
the ruling Politburo and Central Committee of the Communist Party,
Gorbachev and his allies have hinted they intend to press for even
more radical change.
   A return to family farming, conversion of even major industry to
private cooperatives and making the ruble convertible on
international currency markets are among the proposals being
discussed.

   Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis campaigned among Hispanic voters Wednesday, shrugged off
discouraging new polls and accused Republicans of uttering ``a lot
of baloney'' about gun controls.
   Dukakis met with Hispanic leaders in Denver the morning after a
90-minute appearance on ABC-TV's ``Nightline'' program, then flew to
Pueblo in southern Colorado for a large outdoor rally.
   ``The pollsters are not going to call this election,'' Dukakis
said. ``It's people that are going to be voting. We have 13
important days ahead of us.''
   Dukakis again accused Republican rival George Bush and his allies
of producing ``noise pollution'' and distorting the Massachusetts
governor's record on such issues as gun controls.
   ``They're afraid if the smog clears from all the noise pollution
that they have been laying down, that people will realize that they
don't understand average American families,'' the Democratic nominee
said.
   ``Yes, it has been a campaign of distortion and
misrepresentation,'' he said. ``The latest one is gun control.''
   Dukakis has found himself on the defensive about gun controls
during nearly ever visit to the West, where the National Rifle
Association has been broadcasting commercials charging that Dukakis
would disarm gun owners.
   Dukakis says he does not oppose gun ownership by hunters,
sportsmen and homeowners protecting their lives and property, but he
wants to deny them to criminals.
   ``I hope you'll take that word back to your friends and
neighbors. These charges are a lot of baloney, and I hope you'll
tell them that,'' he told about 4,000 people outside the Pueblo
courthouse as he stood next to a large hot-air balloon.
   ``Jack Kennedy said, here in Colorado in 1960, `No attacks, no
attempt to discredit me, no attempt to discredit us will keep us
from speaking up for a stronger America','' Dukakis said, evoking
the name of the late president who defeated Richard Nixon in that
election.
   For the second straight day, Dukakis was greerted by dismal polls
published by leading newspapers.
   A CBS News-New York Times poll placed him 13 percentage points
behind Bush, a further decline in his standing since their Oct. 13
debate in Los Angeles.
   Gallup polls showed Dukakis trailing by 14 points among likely
voters. An earlier Los Angeles Times poll put him nine points down
in must-win California.
   Dukakis took no questions from reporters Wednesday, but referred
to the latest bad news polls during his breakfast meeting with
Hispanic members of Congress and community leaders in Denver.
   ``I'm inspired and encouraged as I always am when I meet with
you,'' he told them. ``We go forth now from Denver to Pueblo and on
across this country to work, to campaign and to win. And we're going
to win.''
   Dukakis aides sought to put the best face possible on the poll
results. They said the CBS-Times poll did not match their own
findings, but some advisers privately did not dispute the California
poll.
   In addition, a Denver Post poll showed him trailing by double
digits in Colorado. Charlie Baker, Dukakis' national field director,
said internal campaign polling showed voters ``trending toward us in
the last few days.''
   He gave no specifics, but said the national contest ``is very
close.''
   In the past week, Dukakis has devoted much of his time to
attacking what he calls lies and distortions by the Bush campaign
and the vice president's criticism of his record on defense, crime
and other issues.
   Baker said that approach was working, the poll results
notwithstanding.
   ``It's clear this campaign of lies and distortions is catching up
with these guys,'' Baker said. ``Our tracking polls showed for the
first time when you ask who is responsible for the negative
campaign, they say George Bush.''
   Dukakis received warmly enthusiastic expressions of support from
the Hispanic leaders.
   Rep. Albert Bustamante, D-Texas, praised Dukakis using the words
``liberal'' and ``technocrat,'' which sometimes are attached to the
Democratic nominee in derision.
   He said Dukakis doesn't smile a lot and isn't a backslapper like
most politicians. ``He's a technocrat. He understands management,''
Bustamante said.
   ``As far as being a liberal in 1988, if liberalism means we care
about children, and we are about the elderly, and we care about the
environment, and we care about family farms ... then I am for
Michael Dukakis, the liberal of 1988.''
   Bustamante said that if there is a heavy voter turnout among
Hispanics on Nov. 8 _ 70 percent or more _ they could swing a close
election in Dukakis' favor.
   Gov. Roy Romer said Dukakis faces an uphill battle in Colorado.
``It's a pretty big hill,'' he said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Increasingly violent turf battles involving
drug dealers have pushed the nation's capital to the brink of a
homicide record this year, the city's police chief said Wednesday.
   With less than three months remaining in 1988, 285 people have
been killed in the District of Columbia, two deaths short of the
record for one year set in 1969. There were 227 homicides in
Washington last year.
   ``We don't have organized crime in this city, so we have a lot of
young entrepreneurs fighting for turf,'' Police Chief Maurice T.
Turner said.
   ``There is just more and more fighting over where the drugs are
to be sold,'' Turner told a news conference at police headquarters.
   Police estimate that 60 percent of this year's killings have been
drug-related, compared with 1986 when 33 percent of the homicides
involved drugs.
   The demand for crack, a highly addictive cocaine derivative, has
fueled the accelerating homicide rate, Turner said.
   ``This is one of the last major cities in this country to have an
infusion of crack,'' Turner said. ``When crack arrived in other
cities, like New York, murder rates went up there too.''
   Turner called for increased federal efforts to stem the flow of
drugs into the United States.
   ``The federal government must increase its commitment to
interdict drugs at our borders and port cities,'' Turner said.
``Unless we intensify our efforts there, the drug problem will
continue to flourish.''
   More than 45,000 people have been arrested since the district
initiated a tough anti-drug program in 1986, but Turner said that
for each drug dealer arrested, another is ready to step forward to
take his place.
   ``People are willing to take the risk of going to jail in order
to make large sums of money,'' Turner said. ``You can make a million
dollars a year selling drugs. They don't have skills. Most of them
are high-school dropouts. What would you do?''
   Although the city's police force has been cut from 5,100 in 1977
to its current level of 3,800, Turner said more police officers
would not necessarily stem the drug trade. Instead, he said, having
more officers on the streets would simply produce more arrests _ and
more crowding in the city's overcrowded jails.
   Turner called on parents and teachers in the nation's capital to
help educate their children about the perils of drug use. He said
casual drug users, as well as drug dealers, are both part of the
problem.
   Speeding addicts through drug treatment programs also will help
reduce the city's appetite for narcotics, Turner said. Drug addicts
must now wait an average of three weeks or longer to enter
city-funded drug treatment programs.

   Seven Lebanese newspapers published a
letter to U.S. hostage Terry Anderson Wednesday on the eve of his
41st birthday _ his fourth in captivity _ from a committee of
journalists working for his release.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest-held of the 14 foreign hostages held in
Lebanon. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985, by a pro-Iranian Shiite
Moslem faction calling itself Islamic Jihad, or Holy War.
   ``Your colleagues in the U.S. and throughout the world salute you
today on your birthday,'' said the letter published Wednesday in the
newspapers. Anderson's birthday actually is Thursday.
   The Christian Voice of Lebanon and the Moslem Voice of the Nation
radio stations broadcast the statement in Arabic against a
background of somber music.
   The stations also announced that they will broadcast the
statement in English on Thursday in the hope that Anderson, who does
not speak Arabic, would be able to hear it.
   The papers also published a photograph of American country music
star Hank Williams Jr. receiving a bracelet from Anderson's sister,
Peggy Say.
   The bracelet includes the captive's name and the date of his
abduction. Williams signed a birthday card for Anderson as did other
stars before the Country Music Association awards show began in
Nashville, Tenn. Oct. 10.
   The papers that published the letter to Anderson included
Al-Haqiqa, the daily publication of the mainstream Shiite Amal
militia.
   Amal is locked in a bitter power struggle with pro-Iranian Shiite
zealots believed holding the foreigners' hostage.
   The letter to Anderson said: ``Those of us on the Journalists'
Committee to Free Terry Anderson, as well as thousands of others
throughout our profession, pay tribute to you for honoring
throughout your career the highest standards of journalism.
   ``We respect your commitment to truth and fairness in your
coverage of Lebanon, your partisanship towards none, your respect
towards all,'' the letter said.
   ``Yet we also honor you today as a man of dignity and courage in
the dark places of privation. All free men and women who live by the
pen share this morning in your captivity.
   ``As you mark your 41st birthday, your fourth in incarceration,
we join our hearts with yours in yearning for your freedom. We greet
you, we salute you and we encourage you,'' the letter said.
   In addition to Anderson, the 13 foreigners missing in Lebanon are
eight Americans, three Britons, an Italian and an Irishman.
   The group has demanded the release of 17 comrades jailed in
Kuwait for the 1983 bombing of the U.S. and French embassies.
   Kuwait has refused to release the convicted terrorists.

Employee</HEAD>

   Islamic extremists claimed responsibility
Wednesday for the killing of a Saudi Arabian diplomat, and the Saudi
ambassador said his embassy had received more than 100 threatening
letters before the attack.
   Police speculated a sole gunman shot Abdulgani Bedawi as the
Saudi Arabian Embassy employee returned to his Ankara apartment
Tuesday night, said Ankara Gov. Saffet Arikan Beduk.
   In Beirut, an extremist group calling itself Islamic Jihad in
Hijaz said it killed Bedawi to avenge the execution of four of its
followers.
   The claim came in a typewritten Arabic statement from the
pro-Iranian Shiite group, whose previous statements detailed
underground activity against the Saudi monarchy. The statement was
delivered to a Western news agency in Beirut.
   There was no immediate response to the Islamic group's claim in
Ankara.
   The Saudi ambassador, Abdulaziz Khojah, said Bedawi had been the
embassy's telex operator for the last six years and held diplomatic
status.
   Khojah said he ruled out robbery or personal conflict in the
killing.
   He added that the embassy had received more than 100 threatening
letters written in Turkish during the Moslem pilgrimage season this
summer.
   Without elaborating, the ambassador said: ``I don't believe the
Turks have anything to do with the incident even though the letters
were in Turkish.''
   Saudi Arabia restricted the number of Moslems who could visit the
country during the pilgrimage season this year according to each
Moslem nation's population.
   The decision came after a riot by Iranians during the 1987
pilgrimage to Mecca that killed more than 400 Iranians.
   Saudi Arabia broke diplomatic ties with Iran in April, listing as
reasons the clash in Mecca and an attack on the Saudi Embassy in
Tehran.
   A Turkish official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Saudi officials had not requested extra protection for embassy
personnel.
   Beduk said police had no clues on the identity of the assailant
but believed a sole gunman killed Bedawi. He did not elaborate.
   Neighbors reported hearing no gunshots, raising the possibility a
silencer was used.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The top counterterrorism official in the U.S.
government said Wednesday he was concerned that Libya might give
chemical weapons to terrorists.
   Ambassador L. Paul Bremer said that while there is no evidence
that Libya intends to arm terrorists with chemical weapons, there
are reasons to fear it might.
   CIA Director William Webster said Tuesday that Libya's chemical
weapons plant was the largest detected by his agency anywhere in the
world.
   Webster refused to say whether the facility was operational, but
other officials have said Libya is on the verge of production.
   ``They have no record of restraint,'' Bremer said in an interview
Wednesday. ``We're concerned, and we think others should be too.''
   Libya, which appeared to suspend its support for terrorist groups
following the U.S. aerial bombing of Tripoli in April 1986, has
resumed its involvement in international terrorism over the past
year, Bremer said.
   The United States has accused Libya of sponsoring attacks against
U.S. Information Agency offices in Costa Rica, Colombia and Peru, as
well as a club frequented by American servicemen in Naples, Italy.
Five people were killed in the Naples attack earlier this year.
   Specifically, U.S. officials accuse Libya of backing the
Palestinian Abu Nidal group, the Irish Republican Army and the
Japanese Red Army.
   Bremer said ``Libya has a track record of providing lethal
weapons to terrorists.''
   He said Libya provided the weapons for the Abu Nidal attacks in
December 1985 at the Rome and Vienna airports, as well as the
Palestinian faction's attack on the City of Poros cruise liner off
the Greek coast last July.
   Libya also sent Soviet-made SA-7 anti-aircraft missiles and
Semtech explosives to the Irish Republican Army, Bremer said. One
shipload of these weapons was intercepted off the French coast last
November.

<HEAD>Company to Suspend Distribution of Abortion Pill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A company will stop distributing a pill to induce
abortions because of ``an outcry of opinion at home and abroad,''
officials said Wednesday.
   Some company sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it
received threats of a boycott against their products, especially
from the United States.
   The move was hailed by Archbishop Albert Decourtray, head of
France's conference of Roman Catholic bishops.
   ``I hope that this withdrawal is due to moral considerations and
not to other reasons stemming from passion or violence,'' he said in
Lourdes, where the conference is meeting.
   In a speech to the conference, Decourtray said the drug
represented a ``serious threat, a new step in the everyday
acceptance of abortion.''
   Opponents of abortion used authorization of the drug to resurrect
the philosophical battle and repeat their long-standing positions.
   The pharmaceutical company, Roussel Uclaf, said the decision to
stop worldwide distribution of the highly effective pill, known as
RU 486, came in response to the ``outcry of public opinion at home
and abroad'' against the drug.
   The pill is an anti-hormone that works against the female hormone
progesterone, which is vital to a normal pregnancy. The new drug
blocks implantation of the fertilized egg in the uterine wall.
   RU 486 is about 80 percent effective when used alone. With a
second product called sulprotone, or prostaglandine E, it is more
than 95 percent effective.
   The new drug is not a do-it-yourself, morning-after pill that can
be purchased at the supermarket and taken at home. It must be used
under supervision of medical specialists in a hospital.
   On Sept. 23, French Health Minister Claude Evin authorized
prescription of the drug subject to strict conditions. It was
delivered on an experimental basis to about 100 hospitals where
abortions are performed.
   The government decision gave Roussel Uclaf, which invested much
money in developing the drug, the green light to put it on the
market. The product already had been approved by the Chinese
government.
   Officials at Roussel, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the company had received threats of boycott against all its
products, ``especially from abroad and especially from the United
States.''
   Abortion has been legal in France, a predominantly Roman Catholic
country, since 1975. Evin said that authorization of RU 486 in no
way changed existing French law on abortions and that they still
would be carried out under strict legal conditions.
   Dr. Arlette Geslin, Roussel's director of medical relations, said
company officials were not suspending distribution of the drug
because of any harmful side effects found in testing.
   ``That is not the case,'' she said. ``And if it had been, we
would have said it was the factor that motivated our decision.''
   Roussel Uclaf is part of the giant West German chemical group
Hoescht, which has the majority share. The French government has a
36 percent share.

<HEAD>Oxford Launches American-style Appeal for Funds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OXFORD, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oxford University launched a U.S.-style,
worldwide appeal Wednesday for more than $380 million to help
overcome a funding crunch that school officials blame mostly on
government cutbacks.
   ``Oxford was built on private philanthropy until about 1920, then
forgot how to do it,'' said Henry Drucker, director of the campaign.
``So we have to go back to the United States and, in a sense, learn
what we taught them in the first place.''
   The ancient school, which already has gained pledges of $90
million in its $387 million drive, will ask alumni and companies to
help bolster its $10 million endowment, refill the nearly 10 percent
of its faculty posts left vacant, and support other projects.
   ``We aim to be a trailblazer and change the climate of opinion
where corporations realize they should be supporting universities
(as they do) in the United States,'' said Vice Chancellor Sir
Patrick Neill.
   About 35 students mounted a protest against the campaign, saying
Oxford should have pressured the government harder before asking for
private support, said university spokeswoman Anne Lonsdale. About 25
other students demonstrated nearby in support of the appeal.
   The five-year drive will include not only fundraising letters but
also the university's first alumni magazine, ``Oxford Today,'' which
was mailed Wednesday. The campaign will have an office in New York
and possibly Tokyo.
   The university, which received its first charter in 1213, has
left 122 of its 1,420 faculty posts vacant as part of a retrenchment
program brought on by an 11 percent cut in government funding for
1986-1991.

<TEXT>
   Radical students attacked U.S. and
South Korean government buildings Wednesday during a string of
protests that broke out nearly simultaneously in a provincial city,
police said.
   Police said one student was seriously injured during the unrest
in President Roh Tae-woo's hometown of Taegu, 170 miles southeast of
Seoul.
   About 300 students were involved in the four attacks in Taegu,
which occurred in a span of one hour, police said.
   Also Wednesday, about 250 students staged a brief street
demonstration in Seoul, burning two cars with firebombs before riot
police squads arrived.
   In Taegu, the nation's third largest city, bands of students
identifying themselves as members of the ``save-the-nation suicide
squad'' attacked the U.S. cultural center and three South Korean
government buildings, police said.
   The U.S. Embassy in Seoul said about 100 students hurled stones
and firebombs, and chased off guards. Firebombs thrown by students
did not explode, but assailants destroyed windows and fled with the
center's sign when police arrived and fired tear gas, the embassy
said.
   There were no injuries and arrests in the brief attack, but three
cars parked inside the center were slightly damaged, the embassy
said.
   Almost simultaneously, bands of students with firebombs and clubs
attacked a police station, a government party building and a
government prosecutor's office in the city's center, police said.
   In one attack, 10 students seized control of a prosecutor's
office for 2{ hours before police moved in with water cannons and
tear gas, they said.
   The students, wearing anti-government headbands, hung a South
Korean national flag and a placard demanding the arrest of former
President Chun Doo-hwan for alleged corruption and other
irregularities involving his seven years in office. Chun left office
in February after national elections.
   During the police operation, Lee Chang-hwan, a 21-year-old senior
at Kyungbuk University in the city, seriously injured his back when
he jumped off a fourth-floor window onto a safety net, which fell
apart on impact.
   Students hurling rocks and firebombs also attacked a government
party building and a police station in the general area, destroying
windows and two cars parked nearby, police said.
   The attack on the U.S. cultural center in Taegu was the third
against U.S. facilities in two weeks.

<HEAD>Dukakis' Late Television Blitz Seen As Last Resort</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic underdog Michael Dukakis is all over
the airwaves in an unprecedented blitz of television interviews that
analysts say can't hurt him but probably won't sway enough voters to
win him the presidency.
   Dukakis is snapping up television invitations with record speed
while Republican George Bush, with double-digit leads in most polls,
weighs when and where and whether to appear.
   ``He has everything to gain because he has nothing to lose,''
John Buckley, a Republican consultant and CBS commentator, said of
the Dukakis strategy. ``He's behind in every poll. He's behind in
more than 40 states. His only hope is to get as much exposure for
himself as possible and hope that what he says has some resonance
with voters.''
   ``He's in a box. He's got to go on TV,'' said Michael Robinson, a
Georgetown University government professor and a director of the
Times-Mirror-Gallup voter surveys. ``But without any real news to go
with the media saturation, no one can possibly expect that the
election would turn around.''
   The Massachusetts governor has no shortage of money for
television advertising. But his campaign has decided that voters, in
addition to 30-second doses of their candidate and his message, also
need lengthier exposures such as Dukakis' 90-minute interview with
Ted Koppel Tuesday night on ABC's ``Nightline.''
   ``This a chance to have people see the real Mike Dukakis,''
spokesman Mark Gearan said Wednesday. ``What we've seen over the
last 20 months is that the more you see him, the more you like him.''
   The Bush camp, which tried to neutralize the ``Nightline''
appearance in some parts of the country with repeated airings during
commercial breaks of an ad accusing Dukakis of opposing ``virtually
every defense system we developed,'' predictably takes the opposite
view.
   ``The more you see and hear him, the less enchanted you are with
him,'' said Bush's ad director, Sig Rogich, who has studied tapes of
Dukakis in every primary season debate.
   The success of the saturation strategy hinges on which way
Dukakis comes across to undecided Americans _ and whether any of
them are still willing to listen. Only about a quarter of probable
voters are undecided at this stage of the game, according to a new
CBS-New York Times poll.
   Dukakis aides put out the word Wednesday that the candidate's
``Nightline'' appearance was ``a terrific session'' for Dukakis.
   ``The people who watch `Nightline' are serious people who wanted
to know what this man believes in. ... He did exactly what he
thought he had to do,'' said Dukakis adviser Steve Engelberg.
   But Dukakis passed up numerous chances during the interview to
stress his new populist image as a fighter for ``Main Street''
Americans, a president who would be ``on your side.'' He also failed
to dispute a Koppel suggestion that Bush has nailed ``your hide to
the wall.''
   Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of
Virginia, called the show ``the dullest interview I've ever seen Ted
Koppel conduct. Dukakis' answers just weren't that lively or
interesting. And he missed so many opportunities to make useful
points from his perspective. Something to warm him up, something to
make him appear more human.''
   Sabato said Dukakis appeared to loosen up in the last few minutes
of the 90-minute interview. ``By then 90 percent of the audience had
fallen asleep or gone to bed. The most important minutes were the
first 10.''
   Dukakis will have a least a few more chances to improve his
performance.
   He's scheduled for 14 minutes Thursday night with Dan Rather on
CBS, an appearance next week with Tom Brokaw on NBC and an interview
with David Frost Nov. 6 on the Fox Broadcasting network.
   He's already appeared on the morning news shows and the Larry
King talk show on CNN. His wife, Kitty, was on CBS' ``Face the
Nation.'' His running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, was on ABC's ``This
Week with David Brinkley'' and was scheduled for a Rather interview
Wednesday night.
   ``It's probably true what the Republicans believe, that the more
you see this guy, the less excited you're going to be about him,''
said Robinson. ``I can't imagine he's going to push people into his
column by force of personality. But he can't hide now, he's got to
come out. He's got to be Michael Dukakis. And he will go down in an
honorable defeat.''
   Regardless of Dukakis' fate, Sabato said, the media ``should be
congratulated'' for giving him so much exposure. ``They're saying no
longer will we let one candidate (refusing to appear) be an
insurmountable roadblock to more campaign coverage,'' he said. ``I
hope the policy will be carried through in future elections.''

   Palace doctors gave Emperor Hirohito almost a half
pint more blood Wednesday after a setback the day before in
five-week efforts to help him regain his health.
   The 87-year-old monarch remained in stable condition, palace
officials said.
   Hirohito, who took power in 1926 and is the world's
longest-reigning monarch, took to bed Sept. 19 after internal
hemorrhaging. Domestic media have reported he has cancer, but palace
officials have refused to comment on the reports.
   The doctors gave Hirohito 0.42 pints of blood in a transfusion
Wednesday to counter his anemia. They administered 1.68 pints in two
emergency transfusions Tuesday after a large loss of blood caused
his blood pressure to plummet.

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge on Wednesday refused a request
to read in court the 48,000-page file related to a soccer riot that
killed 39 people.
   Judge Pierre Verlynde also refused to give free copies to lawyers
defending those charged in the case.
   Some of the lawyers for the 26 Britons charged with involuntary
manslaughter threatened to abandon the trial after the ruling, but
they later returned.
   Verlynde said that parts of the court file specifically
concerning each defendant could be read in court when appropriate.
The reading of the full file would have taken several months.
   Television footage of the riots at the 1985 European Champions'
Cup at Heysel Stadium showed that British fans tore down a fence
separating them from Italian fans and charged them. In the panic
that followed, 39 fans died, including 34 Italians, and more than
500 were injured.
   The Britons were extradited to Belgium last year after they were
identified from the TV footage.
   Since Oct. 18, proceedings have been dominated by legal wrangling
over whether the defense could have free copies of the court file to
study at home.
   Copies of the file can be studied in a court office and the trial
has already been postponed half a year to allow the defense more
time to better prepare their case.
   But since the reopening of the trial Oct. 18, the defense has
continued to insist on more copies.
   Each of the Britons facer up to 10 years in jail.
   Along with the Britons, two Belgian police officers and a former
Belgian soccer federation chairman are accused of doing a poor job
of organizing security at the match. They face up to two years in
jail.

<HEAD>Industry Minister Calls for Quick End to Meat Rationing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new industry minister called Wednesday
for a quick end to meat rationing, and he said the market must
determine prices.
   Meat and gasoline are the only items still rationed since the
government introduced widespread rationing in 1980-81.
   The new minister, Mieczyslaw Wilczek, said he has always
maintained that it was ``abnormal'' that there is food rationing in
a country that has 1.25 acres of land per capita.
   ``We want to lift rationing as soon as possible,'' he said. ``We
must be careful with meat prices because we burned ourselves a few
times with it. That's not the way. The market should decide how much
ham costs.''
   Under rationing, each person gets 5{ pounds of meat a month,
except manual laborers, such as miners and steelworkers who receive
nearly 10 pounds. Meat also can be bought without ration cards at
private meat shops where the price is about three to four times as
much as meat bought with the cards.
   Wilczek, a wealthy private businessman and member of the
Communist Party, outlined his views to improve Poland's ailing
economy at his first news conference since parliament confirmed him
as Industry Minister on Oct. 14.
   Before joining the government, Wilczek was co-owner with foreign
investors of a feed concentrate company, but he has sold his share
worth $215,000, he said in an interview with the Express Wieczorny
newspaper this month.
   Wilczek's wealth and private-sector experience have aroused wide
interest in Poland, and he is seen as Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F.
Rakowski's most innovative appointment in the new cabinet.
   The previous government resigned Sept. 19 after fierce criticism
for mishandling the party-approved economic reform program and
Rakowski, the former party propaganda chief, was approved as the new
prime minister Sept. 27.
   In the past, the government has favored heavy industry,
subsidizing inefficient industries such as steel, shipbuilding and
coal production, and neglected production of consumer goods and
service sectors.
   But the Rakowski government has decided to put priority on the
development of agriculture, housing and environmental protection
sectors of the economy and big factories will have to tighten their
belts to survive, Wilczek said.
   ``There are major industrial companies that have negative yield.
I understand that as soon as possible those companies must be closed
down.''
   Wilczek singled out the shipbuilding industry as a target for
restructuring. The government has been considering closing the Lenin
Shipyard in Gdansk, where the Solidarity trade union was born,
because it is considered unprofitable.
   ``Perhaps fewer and fewer shipyards would make for more efficient
shipyards,'' Wilczek said, without specifying which ones might be
eliminated.
   He also said that one solution to Poland's economic problems
would be to facilitate the creation of small enterprises, especially
service and commercial operations.
   Laws and rules which hinder the development of light industry
will be changed to make it easier for entrepreneurs to do business,
he said.
   Reviving the economy is one of the major challenges facing the
government. Inflation is 60 percent, and the foreign debt stands at
around $40 billion.

   The Soviet Union would probably rather see Vice
President George Bush elected president because he would be far more
predictable than Democrat Michael Dukakis, former Secretary of State
Henry A. Kissinger said Wednesday.
   A Dukakis victory ``would bring about so many uncertainties and
so much confusion,'' Kissinger said at a National Press Club
luncheon. Kissinger also said he has a higher regard for Republican
vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle than the public perception of
him.
   Based on contact he has had with Quayle in the Indiana senator's
role on the Armed Services Committee, Kissinger said that Quayle
knows a ``great deal'' about arms control.
   ``In the area of foreign policy, he has a good basis together
with the experience he will undoubtedly gain as vice president,''
Kissinger said.
   Kissinger, who served in the Nixon-Ford administrations, said
that Dukakis has a 1960s view of the role of American power.
   ``I think he's deeply distrustful of American power,'' Kissinger
said. ``Even when he supports this or that weapons system, it does
not form part of any coherent strategy.''
   ``I really believe that Gov. Dukakis does not have the grasp of
foreign policy to deal with the issues,'' Kissinger said.

<TEXT>
   Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski and
Roman Catholic primate Cardinal Jozef Glemp met Wednesday at a
church palace in the medieval capital city of Gniezno, church and
state officials said.
   Jaruzelski, first secretary of the Polish United Workers
(Communist) Party, was met Glemp at a church palace in Gniezno and
toured the city's 14th century Gothic cathedral.
   The small city in central Poland, 145 miles west of Warsaw, is
the original capital of Poland and the seat of Christianity in the
country, dating back more than 1,000 years. Glemp is archbishop of
Gniezno and Warsaw.
   There was no announcement of the topics of the Jaruzelski-Glemp
talks, the latest in a series of meetings between the two in recent
years.
   But the meeting coincided with difficulties over the convening of
talks between the authorities and opposition on Poland's future. The
talks originally were to have begun last week but the government has
raised objections to two of the proposed delegates of the banned
Solidarity trade union.
   The church has strongly promoted dialogue between officials and
Solidarity, and the leader of the Catholic Club of Intelligentsia in
Warsaw, Andrzej Stelmachowski, has been a key figure in attempting
to set up the talks.
   The meeting also came after church sources at the Vatican said
the Polish government recently offered to sign a concordat giving a
legal basis for church activities in Poland in exchange for
establishment of full diplomatic relations between Poland and the
Holy See.
   The corcordat would replace an agreement that existed between the
church and Poland's government before World War II which was never
renewed after introduction of communist rule.

   The presidents of seven South
America countries arrived Wednesday to seek common positions on
strife in Central America that has resisted peace efforts.
   The leaders of the countries, known as the Group of Eight, also
will discuss drug trafficking and foreign debt at their sessions
Thursday.
   Panama, the eighth member of the group, was suspended after Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, the nation's military leader, ousted
President Eric Delvalle.
   Conflict in Central America is ``like a red light within a world
... tending toward the solution of regional conflicts,'' Argentina's
undersecretary for Latin American affairs, Alberto Ferrari
Etcheberry, said before the meeting.
   Pointing to the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, the end of
Iraq's war with Iran, and signs that Angola's civil war may be
winding down, Etcheberry said, ``The case of Central America is not
advancing and, on the contrary, is entering a period of paralysis.''
   In Nicaragua, rebels financed and armed by the United States are
trying to overthrow the leftist government of President Daniel
Noriega. Neighboring El Salvador has endured a guerrilla war since
1980. Thousands have died in both countries.
   The Group of Eight is an outgrowth of the so-called Contadora
Group, which was formed in 1983 by Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela and
Panama to promote peace in Central America. Argentina, Brazil,
Uruguay and Peru formed the Contadora Support Group in 1985.
   A year later, leaders of the eight countries decided to meet
regularly and discuss issues on a broader front, including trade,
foreign debt and international drug trafficking.
   Developing a foreign debt strategy may be the most pressing topic
on their agenda. The countries are using ever greater shares of
their national budgets for repaying that debt, but the money is
needed for investment and restructuring their economies.
   ``You can't condemn an entire continent to stagnation because
that conspires against hemispheric security and universal justice,''
Argentine President Alfonsin said in a speech to the World Business
Council on Monday.
   Latin American countries owe more than $400 billion to a range of
public and private creditors, and the Group of Eight represents more
than $320 billion of that amount.
   Aides who have been drafting the final communique for the group
also said it will call for a reduction of trade barriers erected by
developed countries.

   Some $95.4 million in seized assets forfeited

expand federal prison space, the Justice Department announced
Wednesday.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh transferred the money from the
assets forfeiture fund under an amendment approved last year by the
Senate.
   The money will replenish funds used to repair and build prison
facilities at Atlanta and Oakdale, La., where Mariel Cuban prisoners
rioted last year; to build detention units at Fort Worth, Texas, and
Tallahassee, Fla.; and to uprgrade the Lompoc, Calif., prison camp
to the status of a federal correctional institution.
   The U.S. Marshals Service, which maintains the assets forfeiture
fund, is currently managing more than $500 million worth of property
seized from criminals, including cars, boats, aircraft, residential
and commercial properties, banks, golf courses, recording studios
and historic mansions. The property is disposed of by the marshals
service.

   Police arrested five Iranian diplomats in
eastern Turkey who allegedly kidnapped an anti-Khomeini activist and
were taking him in the trunk of their car to Iran, the Anatolia news
agency said Wednesday.
   Prosecutor Olcay Seckin of Erzincan province was quoted as saying
the five were arrested at a gas station about 360 miles from the
Iranian border. The Anatolia report said a gas station attendent had
told police there was a man in the trunk of the Iranians' car.
   Anatolia did not say when the arrests were made but another news
agency, Hurriyet, reported they were picked up Sunday.
   It said military police found Seyit Ebu Hasan, an Iranian
engineer, with his arms and legs tied.
   Seckin could not be reached for comment Wednesday but an official
at his office said the five were turned over to police Tuesday.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they
would be delivered for questioning to the State Security Court in
Istanbul, apparently because the abduction originated there. He
would not elaborate.
   Erzincan is 635 miles east of Istanbul and a trip by car takes at
least 24 hours.
   In provinces such as Istanbul, which is under emergency law,
suspects can be held 15 days before charges are brought against them.
   Anatolia identified the five as Resul Bnnsahalan, N.
Ghusrorabdullah Pahhul, Hamit Gezo Mehran Baheri, Ramazan Kahlo and
Orjan Lihe, and said they were all stationed at Iran's consulate in
Istanbul.
   A spokeman at the consulate, Musteba Saidi, said there were no
diplomats by those names working there.
   Hurriyet reported allegations that the five were Iranian
intelligence agents and were trying to smuggle the engineer back to
Iran. The news service said the engineer had been involved in
activities against Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.

   North Korea gave Hungary a harsh warning Wednesday

   ``If the Hungarian authorities, defying our repeated advice,

   Hungary became the first communist nation to normalize diplomatic
ties with South Korea when it announced four days before the summer

permanent missions. A permanent mission is considered a step below a
full-fledged embassy.
   Other communist countries, including Yugoslavia, have sought ties

   President Reagan said Wednesday he will keep
branding the Democratic Party ticket as liberal because ``if the
label fits, they ought to wear it.''
   At the same time, Reagan, campaigning for Republican nominee
George Bush in mostly Democratic Maryland, defended the vice
president's hard-driving campaign rhetoric against Democrat Michael
Dukakis.
   ``And now they're squealing, he's running a negative campaign,''
the president said. ``Well, I think they're squirming because George
has shown America how far outside the mainstream they really are.''
   Reagan's spoke to a fund-raising luncheon for Maryland GOP
senatorial candidate Alan Keyes on the eve of a weeklong campaign
foray to California and several other states. The president will
make appearances in Little Rock, Ark., Springfield, Mo., and San
Diego on Thursday before traveling to Los Angeles.
   The White House also announced that toward the end of the trip,
Reagan will attend a rally for Sen. Chip Hecht, R-Nev., in Reno next
Tuesday and then go to Wisconsin to campaign for Senate candidate
Susan Engeleiter.
   Since Labor Day, Reagan has visited 13 states, the bulk of them
in the heavily competitive industrial Midwest and in key
mid-Atlantic border states.
   Reagan traveled by helicopter to downtown Bltimore in what was
his first campaign appearance this year in Maryland, a key border
state that has been shown by polls to be leaning toward Bush despite
its heavy Democratic registration and voting record.
   Invoking the ``L-word'' _ Reagan's codeword for liberal _ the
president likened Dukakis to incumbent Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md.,
without actually using either one's names.
   ``The incumbent and the stealth candidate at the top of the
liberal ticket are so alike they could be twins,'' he said.
   ``Now, some people think I shouldn't be using the L-word,''
Reagan said. ``They say I'm labeling them.''
   ``What should we call those people who oppose the death penalty?
Who support policies that hand out weekend furloughs to convicted
murderers? Who support laws that make it easier for a criminal to
own a gun than law-abiding citizens who want to protect their homes
and children?'' he asked.
   ``As I say, I thought about it, and then I decided that if the
label fits, they ought to wear it,'' Reagan said.
   Reagan urged Maryland Republicans to work hard for Keyes, a
former State Department and United Nations official who is
challenging Sarbanes, a Democrat seeking re-election to a third term.
   The president said Keyes is ``running for Senate against an
incumbent you don't hear a lot about while the Senate's in session.
Some say he stays out of the limelight because he doesn't like
publicity.''
   ``I think it's because if the good people of Maryland knew more
about him, they'd figure out the kind of senator he really is, and
he'd have to leave town faster than the guy who packed up the Colts
and whisked them off to Indiana in the middle of the night.''
   Reagan was referring to Robert Irsay, owner of the Indianapolis
Colts of the National Football League, who moved his team out of
Baltimore at the end of the 1983 season.

   George Bush's campaign press plane
became an airborne collection agency Wednesday under a new
pay-as-you-fly rule.
   It was said to stem from orders from campaign chairman James A.
Baker III because the campaign is $1 million in the red on press
travel payments.
   A memo issued by Alixe Glen, a deputy press secretary, said
traveling reporters, photographers and technicians had to pay up
immediately, leg by leg, for their travels with Bush unless their
organizations had paid in advance for the remainder of the campaign.
   The memo was issued between Detroit and Sioux Falls, and campaign
aides then roamed the plane taking credit cards from people whose
organizations hadn't paid.
   The campaign estimated the cost per day at about $900 per person.
``Until these payments have been made, we must close out your credit
card on the last leg of each day,'' the memo said.
   There were 91 news people traveling with Bush on this trip.

   For Peggy Say, this is a time of exquisite
agony. The brother she has not seen for 3{ years, hostage Terry
Anderson, marks another birthday Thursday in captivity.
   Anderson, the chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was abducted on March 16, 1985. He is the longest held of the
14 foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   But Mrs. Say, who is spending Anderson's 41st birthday with
family and friends in New York, lives with the hope he will be free
by the presidential election less than two weeks away.
   While she waits, she and her husband, David, spend their time
trying to prepare for Anderson's homecoming.
   ``It's such an agony of anticipation,'' Mrs. Say, 47, said during
a recent interview at her home in a lakeside community near Cadiz.
``On the one hand, having been burned so many times in the past, you
try not to think about it.
   ``I guess it's an exquisite agony,'' she said. ``You know it's
going to happen, that you are building up to it. You are sure that
the long road is at an end. You can actually see it, and yet you
have to wait out the time in between.''
   The couple moved to western Kentucky from Batavia, N.Y., earlier
this year. Mrs. Say was weeks away from a college degree in social
work when Anderson was abducted. She left school and has devoted
herself since to gaining Anderson's release.
   Her mission has enabled her to put aside her fear of flying and
her uneasiness around crowds.
   She has led candlelight vigils outside the White House and had
coffee with President Reagan. In 1986, she made a 5,000-mile trip to
the Middle East. She has appeared on national talk shows and held
her own with dignitaries, including Henry Kissinger.
   She has met with former hostages and received letters from people
who praised her for her courage. She also has defended her brother's
right to have remained in Lebanon, when challenged by listeners on
radio call-in shows.
   Somewhere along the way she has shed her fear of feeling
intimidated.
   ``The one truth I've learned is that people are just people, no
matter what their position. That has made me more comfortable
knowing there's nobody I've met up to this point that has
intimidated me,'' she said.
   ``So I doubt that that will ever happen in my lifetime, which is
a good feeling to know that no matter what happens you are able to
cope.''

   The General Assembly voted 146-0 on
Wednesday to condemn South Africa's segregated municipal elections.
The United States and Britain abstained.
   South Africans of all races voted Wednesday for racially
segregated municipal councils nationwide. Anti-apartheid activists
urged an election boycott, in defiance of state-of-emergency
regulations.
   The U.N. resolution, introduced by Ambassador Wilbert K. Chagula
of Tanzania on behalf of the African Group in the assembly, also
blamed the ``Pretoria racist regime'' for violence before the
balloting, including the bombing of anti-apartheid organization
offices.
   It called the election an ``insidious maneuver by the racist
minority regime of South Africa'' that will ``entrench white
minority rule'' and cause more conflict.
   U.S. Ambassador Patricia M. Byrne said the United States wants
reform and the abolition of apartheid, but could not support the
resolution because it was ``unbalanced and biased'' in blaming all
the violence on South African officials.
   She said the resolution failed to mention anti-apartheid
guerrillas who bombed public places and targeted election officials
for assassination.
   Sir Crispin Tickell, the British ambassador, also said his nation
believes the resolution was one-sided. He said its description of
apartheid as ``a threat to international peace and security'' was
exaggerated.
   Tickell said it was unwise to pass resolutions condemning South
Africa while it is involved in delicate negotiations with Cuba and
Angola on a Cuban troop withdrawal from Angola and independence for
Namibia.
   The resolution also called for ending South Africa's ban on
opposition political organizations, lifting the state of emergency,
withdrawing South African troops from black townships, amnesty for
political exiles, and freeing all ``political prisoners'' and
detainees.
   It said South Africa should hold elections ``on the basis of
universal adult sufferage in an unfragmented South Africa.''
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Not Everyone Shot A Moose In N.H.'s 1st Hunt Since 1901</HEAD>

   Shirley Dupuis and her husband hardly spoke
a word to each other on the 3{-hour ride home. The exhilaration of
three days earlier had turned into gloom in the woods of northern
New Hampshire.
   They failed to get a moose.
   ``It's all over but the crying,'' she said this week following
New Hampshire's first moose hunt since 1901. She was among the 75
chosen by lottery for the hunt. Fifty-seven hunters got a moose.
   They weren't alone in their failure, ``but it sure feels like
it,'' said Mrs. Dupuis, 34. ``My husband took it pretty hard,'' she
said.
   They had done all the right things: they scouted the area and saw
moose before the hunt, and when the season started, they hunted from
sunrise to sunset. But they never glimpsed one of the huge animals
during the hunt.
   ``You've just got to be in the right place at the right time,''
she said.
   New Hampshire wildlife officials decided to hold the hunt because
of pressure from hunters who said the herd was on the rebound. More
than 4,000 moose are in the state, according to estimates.
   One protest against the hunt was held, but only about a dozen
people attended. State officials have scheduled a larger hunt next
year.
   Leslie Reed, 57, of Concord, and his partner, Ron Clair, had no
luck in bagging a moose either.
   ``I thought for sure, I could almost guarantee we'd get one,''
Reed said.
   ``We did a lot of scouting and saw a lot of moose,'' Reed said.
When the hunt began last Tuesday, they saw a huge bull about 700
yards away shortly after sunrise. But when they tried to sneak up on
him, he was gone.
   Then on Friday, the day after the hunt ended, two moose walked
into their camp.
   All Reed could do was lift his camera instead of his gun.

   Rep. Pat Swindall gave up any hope of a
pre-election verdict in his perjury trial Wednesday when a judge
dismissed the jury because the congressman had mailed out campaign
literature mentioning the case.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Vining made it clear there would be no
further attempt to seat a jury before the Nov. 8 election. The 12
jurors and two alternates selected over three days were excused
before hearing any arguments or testimony.
   Vining also rejected a request by the two-term Republican to
proceed with a non-jury trial, in which the judge renders the
verdict.
   ``I'm disappointed,'' Swindall said, but he expressed no regrets
over the campaign mailings, one of which included his claim that he
passed a private polygraph test about his truthfulness.
   ``I very much would have liked to have had an exoneration before
the election,'' he said. ``However, I knew that with a campaign with
only two weeks to go, and with the issue of perjury uppermost in
many people's minds, that it was important for me to get that
polygraph evidence out to the voters of the 4th District, because it
totally exonerates me.''
   The government contends an agent posing as a money broker told
Swindall that an $850,000 home mortgage the congressman was seeking
might be drug money. Prosecutors said Swindall lied in telling a
grand jury he did not remember such a warning.
   The judge, in dismissing the jury, cited two pieces of campaign
literature that he said could have reached potential jurors.
   He said he also wants authorities to investigate whether
Swindall, who is representing himself, violated court rules
governing the comments lawyers may make about their cases.
   ``It became apparent this morning that it would be extremely
difficult for you to try a case during a political campaign when one
of the parties is involved in the campaign,'' Vining told the jurors.
   Later, he added, ``I just believe myself it's not the time and
place to try the case, so I'm not going to.''
   Swindall is locked in a re-election battle with Democrat Ben
Jones, a former actor who played Cooter on television's ``Dukes of
Hazzard.''
   Swindall said Wednesday that if there is no verdict before the
election he will ask voters to support him with the understanding he
would resign if convicted. That approach, he said, would ensure that
a new GOP candidate could run.
   ``I believe they will re-elect me with the understanding that an
exoneration after the election is just as good as an exoneration
before the election,'' he said.
   Jones would not comment on the case. ``We had an 18-point lead
before the indictment, and we got it not because of his problems,
but because of our hard work,'' he said.
   A poll by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution after Swindall's Oct.
17 indictment found Jones leading 53 percent to 27 percent.
   The campaign, one of the bitterest in the country, has featured
Swindall's repeated questions about Jones' admitted bout with
alcoholism.
   Swindall has been hounded by news reports of the investigation
that led to his indictment, and Jones once suggested the congressman
be tested for drug use and psychiatric problems.
   Swindall gave up the right to make many pre-trial arguments,
including a claim that he was being prosecuted for political gain,
and successfully pushed for a trial date just a week after the
indictment on 10 counts of perjury.
   Opening arguments had been scheduled for Wednesday, but Vining
opened the day's session by introducing the mass mailings into
evidence.
   ``He's showed us he would rather run for office than have this
trial,'' said prosecutor Craig Gillen.
   He said the mailings made it impossible to hold the trial because
they could be delivered to jurors' homes even after testimony began
or could be mentioned to them by relatives.
   Swindall pleaded with the judge to question the jurors about
whether they had received the mailings instead of dismissing the
panel, and he renewed his accusation that his indictment was timed
to fall just before the election.
   At a news conference, Swindall was questioned repeatedly by
reporters about whether he authorized mention of the polygraph in
his mailing. He said he had approved the mailing before ``a decision
was made'' to add the mention of the polygraph test.
   Pressed about who made the decision, Swindall insisted he had
answered the question until his wife broke in to say, ``He didn't; I
did.''

<HEAD>Political Storm Accompanies Hurricane</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hurricane Joan spawned an intense
political storm between the Sandinistas and their opponents as it
rampaged across Nicaragua.
   President Daniel Ortega frequently compared the hurricane's
assault to attacks by guerrillas and said the best relief aid the
United States could offer would be halting aid to the rebels, known
as Contras.
   Monsignor Bismarck Carballo, a Roman Catholic church spokesman,
accused the government of mixing political slogans with emergency
broadcasts.
   Joan came ashore early Saturday morning at Bluefields, flattened
the Caribbean port of 38,000 people, and cut a path of destruction
across to the Pacific in the following 24 hours.
   It killed at least 60 people and left 300,000 homeless. Nicaragua
issued a general appeal for emergency assistance. Nations as diverse
as Britain and Cuba responded with aid, but the United States said
it probably would not.
   Ortega said Wednesday the hurricane had destroyed a key farming
and ranching area in central Nicaragua. After touring the region he
said Joan wiped out cattle herds, pastures, forests, grain crops,
more than 20,000 homes in 22 communities in 40 square miles.
   The official radio, Voice of Nicaragua, described the district 90
miles east of Managua as the country's main farming and ranching
area.
   Political barbs began last week as the storm approached the
Caribbean coast, after the U.S. Congress approved a resolution
leaving open the possibility of renewed aid to the Contras.
   ``It is inconceivable that, while Nicaraguans face the threat of
catastrophe the American Congress maintains its threat to escalate
the war,'' Ortega said.
   The Contras and Sandinistas agreed in March to a cease-fire, but
further talks broke off in September. Most rebels moved to base
camps in Honduras in the last few months, but both sides still
report minor skirmishes.
   Nicaragua's economy has been devastated by seven years of civil
war, which the government says has cost $7 million.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday of Ortega:
``It seems clear he wants to use this storm as another platform for
propaganda against the Contras.''
   In his complaints about propaganda during the Hurricane
emergency, Carballo said: ``The Voice of Nicaragua started to
transmit that neither President Reagan nor Joan would destroy the
revolution.''
   Anti-U.S. rhetoric has caused the government problems among the 3
million Nicaraguans. Some refused to evacuate for Joan because, they
said, the Sandinistas had lost their credibility by warning
repeatedly of ``imminent'' U.S. invasions.
   ``People are tired of hearing these calls and don't believe
them,'' said Ruben Hernandez, who refused to leave his home in a
poor, low-lying neighborhood of Managua.
   Both Fitzwater and Nicaragua's sole opposition newspaper, La
Prensa, criticized an emergency law that suspended articles of the
constitution dealing with freedom of speech for 30 days, which
includes the U.S. election Nov. 8.
   ``To do it at this time under cover of a storm is no worse really
than the performance he has displayed for the past six or seven
years in terms of closing down the press,'' Fitzwater said.
   While touring devastated Bluefields on Monday, Ortega said
Nicaragua might accept U.S. government hurricane aid if it was
offered ``without conditions,'' and expressed certainty that help
would come from private American groups that oppose their
government's Central America policy.
   On Tuesday, the pro-government newspaper El Nuevo Diario said
Nicaragua did not want aid from Washington.
   Fitzwater said Monday the United States feared any emergency aid
it offered would help Nicaragua against the Contras.
   In reply, the government newspaper Barricada said: ``It's better
for the Yankees to keep their blankets, milk for children and
medicine for our homeless brothers.''
   Bluefields fisherman Aster Gerth asked a visitor, however: ``Do
you think the United States will help? The Russians and the Cubans
can't do what the United States can.''
   Roberto Arguello, director of the Nicaraguan American Bankers
Association, said most Nicaraguan exiles in Miami had the attitude:
``Let the Russians help them out.''
   Cuba sent hurricane experts before the storm hit and sheltered
Nicaraguan air force planes at its airfields. Cuban doctors and
emergency supplies arrived immediately after Joan's departure.

<HEAD>Greenspan Opposes Involving Fed in S&L Bailouts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan says
the fund insuring savings and loan deposits needs more money, but
requiring the Fed to help bail it out could ``set a dangerous
precedent.''
   As savings institution losses have mounted, congressional debate
has intensified over whether taxpayers must pay to bailout the
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., and over alternatives to
tax money.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates S&Ls and
oversees the insurance fund, maintains the assessment levied on the
industry can cover the costs.
   But many analysts, and now Greenspan, agree that the insurance
fund's current flow of revenue isn't enough.
   ``Clearly the FSLIC will need additional resources,'' Greenspan
said in a statement released Wednesday by the Senate Banking
Committee.
   But he added that any move to tap the Fed for money ``would mark
a sharp departure from the view traditionally held in our nation
that the resources of the Federal Reserve ... should not be used for
special purposes and would set a dangerous precedent for the
future.''
   He also said that ``funding from the Federal Reserve would add to
the federal budget deficit essentially in the same way as a budget
expenditure.''
   The Fed, as the nation's central bank, uses its funds to control
inflation in the economy, intervene in foreign exchange markets and
act as a lender of last resort during financial crises such as the
October 1987 stock market crash.
   Greenspan's remarks, made in a statement dated Oct. 17, were
offered in response to questions, submitted July 29 by the Banking
Committee, on a wide range of subjects.
   Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., who is expected to become
chairman of the committee next year, asked Greenspan about a
proposal to require the Fed to pay interest on reserves it hold from
U.S. commercial banks and channel the money to the FSLIC. Another
suggestion would require the Fed to accept as collateral for loans
FSLIC notes issued to ailing S&Ls.
   Greenspan offered no solution to the S&L crisis but said his
agency would express its views when Congress takes up the topic. In
the meantime, he said the Federal Reserve Banks would act as a
lender of last resort to S&Ls in trouble if the Federal Home Loan
Bank system cannot.
   His comments came three weeks after L. William Seidman, chairman
of the insurance fund for commercial banks, told the American
Bankers Association he would fight any attempt to tap the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp.
   Government estimates have put the cost of restoring the S&L
industry to solvency at $45 billion to $50 billion, with private
analysts setting the cost at up to $100 billion.
   Greenspan said ``great uncertainty'' surrounds estimates of S&L
losses because ``relatively small changes'' in the value of real
estate securing loans to troubled institutions ``can have a major
impact on the magnitude of thrift industry losses.''
   ``But ... it is clear that the FSLIC is facing large problems
which are going to be with us for some time to come,'' he said.

<HEAD>`Low-Input' Farming Pushed as Answer to Pesticide Problem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government should step up research and
promotion of so-called low-input farming to halt contamination of
groundwater with nitrates and pesticides, a House panel said
Wednesday.
   ``Given the seriousness of the problems besetting agriculture
today, the least we can do is ensure that this option is available
for farmers,'' said Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., chairman of the
environment, energy and natural resources subcommittee.
   The panel released a report based on a year-long investigation of
the pesticide issue, ``Low Input Farming Systems: Benefits and
Barriers.''
   Low-input farming refers to techniques ranging from
chemical-free, or ``organic'' agriculture, to the careful targeting
and reduced use of chemical pesticides on crops.
   The EPA estimates that of 1.1 billion pounds of pesticides used
in the United States in 1984, 77 percent, or 861 million pounds,
were applied to agricultural crops.
   These chemicals, some of which have been linked to cancer and
other health problems, along with nitrates from agricultural
fertilizers have increasingly been found in groundwater which
furnishes the major drinking supply to almost half of all Americans.
   ``While a low-input management system is not a cure-all for
agriculture's troubles, it offers the potential of improving the
efficiency of farm operations by lowering input costs and reducing
contaminants that end up in the soil and groundwater,'' Synar said.
   The panel reported that even when cutting back on pesticides had
reduced crop yield, some farmers reported greater net earnings
because of reduced production costs.
   But the EPA has focused little attention on non-chemical methods
in reaching its regulatory decisions, the report said. Poor
coordination between the agency and the agriculture department are
to blame, it said.
   The panel also cited an array of barriers to widespread adoption
of low-input methods to U.S. farming. They included: lack of
research, chemical industry influence on farmers, limited
information available and worry among agricultural producers that
switching to alternative production methods would risk short-term
income loss.
   In 1985, the report said, Congress authorized the Agriculture
Department to develop a low-input farming methods program. It said,
however, that the department did not request money for it and that
it remained unfunded until lawmakers approved $4.1 million in the
fiscal year that ended last month.

   Federal prosecutors Wednesday accused 27 people,
including a Ku Klux Klansman and a Georgia lawyer, of taking part in
an eight-state ring that distributed cocaine and marijuana and
manufactured methamphetamine.
   U.S. Attorney Robert Barr said the drug and money-laundering
charges were contained in an indictment returned Friday that also
seeks the seizure of a golf course.
   The indictment identifies Donald E. Miles of Norcross as the
ringleader.
   Barr said 16 of the 27 defendants, including Miles, had been
arrested and prosecutors were asking they be held without bail.
   The ring operated in Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Alabama, California, Washington and Idaho, with most of
the manufacturing of methamphetmine, or ``speed,'' done in
Washington, Barr said.
   The indictment seeks the forfeiture of 15 pieces of land,
including a golf course in Winder worth more than $3 million and 23
vehicles worth about $200,000.
   Most of those named in the indictment are from Georgia, including
Donald Oscar Nelson, an attorney in middle Georgia's Monroe County.
He is accused of using drug proceeds to make purchases for Miles.
   Others indicted included Jim Blair of Five Points, Ala., former
Imperial Wizard of Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. He gave up the
national post in 1986 in an unsuccessful bid for a seat in the
Alabama House.
   Authorities said they had no evidence of Klan involvement in the
drug ring.
   Nelson and Blair were among those arrested.

<HEAD>Bush Up by Eight in ABC-Post Poll</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A national poll Wednesday gave George Bush an
eight-point advantage over Michael Dukakis in the race for
president, a somewhat smaller lead than the Republican nominee
enjoyed in two earlier polls this week.
   The ABC News-Washington Post poll of 1,242 likely voters put the
contest at 52-44 percent, closer than the 13-point gap in a CBS
News-New York Times poll and the 14 points among likely voters in a
Gallup poll released Tuesday.
   The ABC-Post poll was conducted during the seven days ending
Tuesday, rather than the three- and four-day field periods of the
earlier polls.
   That could account for differing results. Polls done during fewer
days are more liable to be influenced by daily movements in voter
preference. In polls done over more time, changes may be tempered by
days of stable opinion.
   ABC-Post polls have showed slight movement in the race, with Bush
ahead by six points in an Oct. 5-11 poll, seven in an Oct. 12-18
poll and eight now. The Gallup and CBS-Times polls, done in shorter
periods, found more movement for Bush after the Oct. 13 presidential
debate.
   The margin of sampling error in the ABC-Post poll was plus or
minus three percentage points.

   Cold air swept from Canada toward the northern Plains on
Wednesday and thunderstorms continued over parts of Louisiana and
eastern Texas.
   Strong winds, freezing temperatures and scattered snow showers
were expected by late Wednesday in Montana and North Dakota, with
snow accumulations up to 6 inches in western and central Montana.
   The wind chill factor was expected to create the equivalent of
temperatures of zero to 10 below zero across North Dakota on
Thursday.
   Thunderstorms produced tornadoes in southwest Louisiana at the
town of Sulphur, in southwest Lake Charles, near the town of
Jennings and 20 miles north of Crowley. Minor damage was reported.
   Showers drenched parts of Mississippi, Alabama and northern
Georgia.
   Lake-effect snow in the Northeast diminished Wednesday, but some
locations in the northeast corner of Ohio, northwest Pennsylvania
and the western tip of New York reported a few inches of snow.
Willoughby, Ohio, had 5 inches of snow on the ground around at
midday and 1 to 3 inches of snow was measured across Chautauqua
County, N.Y., along Lake Erie southwest of Buffalo.
   A few rain and snow showers fell in Michigan, eastern New York,
northeast Pennsylvania and New England.
   Skies were mostly sunny Wednesday afternoon from the lower Ohio
Valley across the central Plains and the southern Rockies to the
desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 30
degrees at Ely Minn., to 91 degrees at Thermal, Calif., and Palm
Springs, Calif. The nation's low Wednesday morning was 7 degrees at
Gunnison Colo.
   The forecast for Thursday called for scattered showers and
thunderstorms from the southern Plains across northern Louisiana and
Arkansas to Missouri. Scattered showers were predicted from the
lower Ohio Valley to the upper Mississippi Valley, with showers
turning to snow across northern Minnesota, the northern Plains and
northern Rockies.
   High temperatures were forecast to be in the 20s and 30s from
northern Minnesota across most of the Dakotas to the northern
Rockies; 40s and 50s from the northern and middle Atlantic Coast
states across the Great Lakes region, southern Minnesota, Nebraska,
the central Rockies and Idaho to Washington state; and 80s in much
of Florida, the southern Plains, southern New Mexico and interior
valleys of California. Readings should reach 85 to 95 degrees in the
desert Southwest and 60s and 70s elsewhere.

   A 16-ton sculpture in a SoHo art gallery fell on
top of two workers Wednesday, causing one of them to lose a leg,
officials said.
   The workers were removing the piece, ``Reading Cones'' by Richard
Serra, from the first-floor Leo Castelli Gallery at 142 Greene St.
when a set of heavy-duty jacks collapsed and dropped the artwork,
said Efrain Parrilla, a Fire Department spokesman.
   Rescue workers lifted the sculpture to free the men and then took
them to hospitals.
   John Clark, a Bellevue Hospital administrator, said surgeons were
unable to save Joseph Gallo's right leg, which was amputated below
the knee. Clark said Gallo, 30, was admitted in serious but stable
condition.
   Daniel Hafner, in his 30s, was in stable condition at
Beekman-Downtown Hospital.
   The curved piece of steel is 3 inches thick, 14 feet high, 17
feet long and weighs 32,000 pounds, said a gallery spokesman. The
workers were taking it to storage.

   Guerrillas shot and killed a
policeman and wounded another in an ambush Wednesday, and a car bomb
killed a Post Office manager outside Belfast's main postal sorting
office, police said.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks,
which occurred 70 miles apart and within minutes of each other,
around 7 p.m. (3 p.m. EDT).
   The policemen had just come off duty and were traveling to
Enniskillen in County Fermanagh when their private car was raked
with gunfire near the village of Kinawley, 70 miles southwest of
Belfast, said police Sgt. Michael Glover.
   Both men were seriously wounded and one later died of his
injuries, police said. Their identities were not immediately
released.
   In central Belfast, a booby-trap bomb exploded under a car in a
multi-story parking lot across the road from the city's main sorting
office, killing a Post Office transport manager.
   The official, who was not immediately identified, got into the
car after leaving work and had driven a short distance toward the
exit when the blast destroyed his car, Glover said.
   The victim apparently had no connection with the security forces,
which are targeted by the Irish Republican Army, Glover said.
   The outlawed, Roman Catholic guerrilla group is fighting to drive
the British out of Northern Ireland and unite the
Protestant-dominated province with the Catholic Republic of Ireland
under socialist rule.
   A total of 2,703 people are known to have been killed since
political and sectarian violence erupted in Northern Ireland in 1969.

   Republican George Bush sounded like a man counting down the hours
to victory in the race for the White House on Wednesday as he
renewed his pledge not to raise taxes. Democrat Michael Dukakis
vowed ``to work, to campaign and to win'' despite the odds against
him.
   The latest news from the pollsters was anything but good for the
Democrats. A Washington Post survey in Maryland _ one of the
nation's most Democratic states _ showed Bush with a nine-point
lead, on top of two national polls Tuesday that showed a
double-digit Democratic deficit.
   Bush's lead was back down to a single digit in an ABC
News-Washington Post poll released late Tuesday in which he was
ahead by 52-44. The survey of 1,242 likely voters was conducted
during seven days _ a longer sampling period than in the other
surveys _ and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three
percentage points.
   The vice president began his campaign day in Detroit, where he
said Dukakis sounds like a man ``just itching to repeal'' the income
tax cuts of the Reagan era. The vice president also defended his
call for a capital gains tax cut from Dukakis' criticism.
   ``It's not a tax break for the rich. It is a break for those who
want to have a job in this country,'' he said.
   Dukakis was in Colorado, meeting privately with Hispanic leaders
who later said high voter turnout among their constituents could
deliver a Democratic upset on Election Day. He laid claim to strong
Hispanic support and said that was due in part to his stand against
drugs.
   ``They want a president who doesn't talk about the subject but
who has done something about it,'' he said.
   In Pueblo, Dukakis defended his record on gun control in a region
where he has been under heavy advertising attack from the National
Rifle Association. Dukakis said he does not oppose gun ownership by
hunters and sportsmen and for protection.
   ``I hope you'll take that word back to your friends and
neighbors,'' he said. ``These charges are a lot of baloney and I
hope you'll tell them that.''
   Advisers insisted the campaign's own polling reflects a closer
race than the Bush lead in national polls. Said the candidate, ``The
pollsters are not going to call this election. It's the people who
are going to be voting.''
   He added he would go ``on across this country to work, to
campaign and to win.''
   Bush optimistically looked beyond the election.
   ``If I am elected in 13 days, 8 hours and 22 minutes from now ...
I will work with Congress _ got to do that _ telling them the
American people in electing me voted against a tax increase,'' he
said. ``Now let's sit down together, honor the people's decision,
and hold spending increases to the rate of inflation.''
   Bush also contended that there have been a ``staggering'' number
of jobs created as a result of Reagan-era tax cuts.
   ``My opponent thinks they were a disaster,'' Bush said. ``Those
sound to me like the words of someone who is just itching to repeal
one of the most successful economic policies in our history.''
   President Reagan ventured into Democratic Maryland and said
Dukakis has unjustly accused Bush of running a negative campaign.
   ``Well, I think they're squirming because George has shown
America how far outside the mainstream they really are,'' Reagan
said in Baltimore. ``They may not like it, but George has thrown a
clear light on their views.''
   Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen, interviewed
live on the CBS Evening News, nonetheless urged Bush to ``root'' out
the distortions that he is allowing in the campaign.
   When asked by anchorman Dan Rather whether the campaign wasn't
being hypocritical because it hadn't dealt often with black leaders
and voters, Bentsen said he and Jesse Jackson had participated
recently in a joint satellite session with college students. The two
men were in separate cities for that event.
   Bentsen also said he planned to appear with Jackson this week.
Campaign officials said afterward the event was still tentative
because of Jackson's schedule.
   Bush's running mate, Dan Quayle, was asked about a CBS-New York
Times poll that indicated he was the most unpopular of the four men
at the top of the presidential tickets.
   Quayle said Dukakis is ``the person that is unpopular in America
... he's dragging his ticket down.''
   When reporters pressed the Indiana senator about whether he might
be costing Bush some votes, Quayle said, ``As a matter of fact, when
we got on this ticket we were double-digits behind, and we're doing
quite well.''

   A male calendar contest at a popular
nightclub is causing a stir in this northern Kentucky city, and the
club's owner says there wouldn't be a problem if the contestants
were women instead of men.
   The Monday night performance, billed as ``The Men of Menagerie
Calendar Contest,'' took place as scheduled at the Glass Menagerie,
but city officials say the show must not go on.
   The matter has been turned over to the city's legal advisers,
said Zoning Administrator Ralph Hopper.
   Hopper warned the nightclub's owner that the contest violates
city zoning ordinances on adult entertainment and ordered the club
to halt the show or face a fine.
   About an hour before the Monday performance, Lt. Ralph Schawe
delivered Hopper's order. But the show went on anyway.
   ``It was a very professional show. The costumes were fantastic,''
said Detective Marty Epperson, a plainclothes officer who went to
the contest to serve as a witness for the city.
   Participants wore costumes at the beginning and stripped down to
G-strings while music played, she said.
   The nightclub is in a highway commercial zone in which adult
entertainment is prohibited. The club could face a fine of $10 to
$500 per day, and its liquor license could be jeopardized.
   The contest is no different than female calendar contests
sponsored by other Covington nightspots, said Glass Menagerie owner
Larry Grause.
   Participants ``strut their stuff'' for the audience, which
chooses the winner by applause, he said.
   ``As far as we're concerned, this a sexist type of attack,''
Grause said. ``Obviously, it was generated by our competitors
because it was a successful promotion.''
   Hopper said he was unaware of similar contests at other
nightspots.

   For those wanting to move up and live in upper,
upscale neighborhoods, it's either the East Coast or the West Coast.
   The most expensive suburb in the United States is La Jolla,
Calif., where the average home goes for $1.1 million, according to a
survey of the costliest 75 suburban real estate markets.
   But more than half the communities on the list are in the
tristate New York metropolitan area.
   After La Jolla comes Alpine, N.J., where homes average $1.06
million, followed by two Long Island villages, Laurel Hollow and
Mill Neck, and Jupier Island, Fla., all at a flat $1 million,
according to the survey conducted during the summer by the Solomon
Organization, a public relations company.
   The study was undertaken for RELO, a Chicago-based association of
1,300 independent real estate brokers who specialize in arranging
moves for corporate employees.
   The rest of the top 10 were: Old Westbury, N.Y., $980,000; Saddle
River, N.J., $975,000; Lattingtown, N.Y., $950,000; Rancho Santa
Fe., Calif., $922,000, and Brookville, N.Y., and Muttontown, N.Y.,
$900,000.

   Hundreds of people marched
through the capital on Wednesday, the first anniversary of a human
rights leader's slaying, and Amnesty International said right-wing
death squads have re-emerged.
   About 500 people attended a religious service honoring Herbert
Anaya Sanabria, then marched through the capital to lay flowers at
his grave.
   Anaya, 33, was gunned down on Oct. 26, 1987, near his home in San
Salvador. He was the fifth director of the Salvadoran Human Rights
Commission to be assassinated since 1980.
   The government blamed the crime on the leftist guerrilla
Farabundo Marti Liberation Front. But Roman Catholic Church and
humanitarian groups say it was the work of a rightist death squad.
   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group, said
death squads, usually including soldiers or police, have killed
hundreds of people suspected of being leftists or government
opponents in the past two years.
   It said death squads are re-emerging because of military
opposition to peace negotiations with the front and that Anaya's
slaying was seen as an attempt to discourage the talks.
   Soldiers and death squads killed tens of thousands of suspected
leftists in the 1970s and early 1980s, but death squad activity
diminished after the U.S.-backed civilian government came to power
in 1984.
   Col. Jose Galileo refused to comment on the Amnesty International
report, but he said the armed forces would issue a bulletin on the
issue later, possibly Thursday.
   The government said the guerrilla front killed Anaya because he
left the front to collaborate with the military.
   It said a suspected guerrilla, Jorge Alberto Miranda Arevalo,
admitted killing Anaya. Miranda, 19, says he was forced to confess
to a crime he did not commit.
   Anaya's widow, Mirna Perla, told a news conference Wednesday that
Miranda is ``another innocent victim.''
   In another incident Wednesday, two guerrillas broke into a radio
station in San Salvador on Wednesday and broadcast a tape attacking
Duarte's government. The guerrillas were gone by the time police
arrived.
   The guerrillas have been fighting the U.S.-backed armed forces
for nine years. An estimated 65,000 people, most of them civilians,
have died in the war.

   Israeli warplanes attacked Palestinian
guerrilla bases at Sidon and Beirut on Wednesday, killing at least
six people, including a man identified as a senior PLO commander.
   A family of six and three other people were missing and feared
dead under the rubble in Mieh Mieh, a refugee camp outside Sidon
that suffered the greatest damage. Police said 41 people were
wounded, all but one at Mieh Mieh.
   In south Lebanon, Israeli soldiers and allied militiamen poured
artillery fire on positions of Lebanese guerrillas in and around
Mashgara, police reported. They said it might be a prelude to a
ground thrust.
   Jets struck targets outside the southern port and the capital 4{
hours apart in the third and fourth raids since a suicide Shiite
Moslem car bomber killed eight Israeli soldiers a week ago in the
border ``security zone'' Israel maintains in south Lebanon.
   At least 27 people have been killed and 16 wounded in the four
raids, which bring the total Israel air strikes in Lebanon this year
to 19. Police say at least 95 have been killed and 184 wounded in
all the raids.
   In Jerusalem, an Israeli military spokesman later said the planes
blasted suspected guerrilla bases in southern Lebanon three times
Wednesday _ although Lebanese police reported two raids _ with all
aircraft home safe after scoring accurate hits. Under military
regulations, the spokesman was not identified.
   He said the planes bombed sites around Damour and Beirut after
raiding targets near Sidon.
   ``The raid near Sidon is one of the heaviest, if not the
heaviest, in Lebanon this year,'' said a police spokesman, whose
name cannot be used because of regulations. He said it caused ``the
most severe destruction in Mieh Mieh since the 1982 Israeli
invasion.''
   Among those killed in the refugee camp was Col. Mustafa Daoud,
40, commander of the Fatah Militia, a guerrilla group of about 1,000
fighters from the mainstream Fatah faction led by PLO chief Yasser
Arafat, police said.
   Most of the wounded were guerrillas and included Col. Mohsen
Hallak, commander of the 1,000-man Beit al-Maqdes (Jerusalem)
battalion, another Palestine Liberation Organization unit, the
police spokesman reported. He said some others were officers of
Force 17, the PLO security service.
   Police said the second Israeli raid struck bases of pro-Syrian
Palestinian factions in the hills of Khalde and Aramoun on Beirut's
southern fringe. They described the main target as a base behind a
hilltop monastery overlooking the towns of Damour and Naameh, midway
along the coastal highway between Beirut and Sidon. The port city is
about 25 miles south of Beirut.
   The raiding jets struck twice within 15 minutes, firing 10
air-to-surface rockets, four of which failed to explode, the report
said. Journalists were not allowed to approach the base, which
consists of half a dozen tents belonging to the Democratic Front for
the Liberation of Palestine.
   Syrian anti-aircraft batteries near Beirut airport and Aramoun
fired at attackers but police said they claimed no hits.
   Police in the south said four fighter-bombers streaked in from
the Mediterranean at 11 a.m. and fired 12 rockets into Mieh Mieh and
nearby Ein el-Dilb hill in three passes spread over eight minutes.
   ``At least 30 buildings within a radius of 150 meters in Mieh
Mieh's central square were pulverized,'' the police spokesman said.
``Many victims, including a family of six living in an abandoned
UNRWA school are still buried in he rubble.''
   The U.N. Relief and Works Agency aids Palestinian refugees.
   Abu Yasser, PLO military commander for the Sidon region, said:
``It's a massacre. Plenty of people are buried in the debris.''
   A guerrilla who gave his name as Abu Khaled said: ``It was so
swift that we couldn't look up at the sky to fire back at the
planes.''
   Israel said the raids followed two unsuccessful attempts by
Palestinian guerrillas Tuesday to infiltrate into Israel from
Lebanon.
   Israel television said Israeli-backed militiamen from the
Christian village of Jezzine in southern Lebanon destroyed a
guerrilla outpost near Libah, east of Sidon. It said the mainly
Christian force killed one Moslem militiaman, captured three and
suffered two casualties, not specified.
   The outpost was on a hill overlooking Jezzine and subjected the
town to constant artillery bombardments.
   Bassam Abu Sharif, chief spokesman for Arafat, claimed in
Baghdad, Iraq, that Israeli troops were massing for an attack on
Palestinian and Lebanese forces at Sidon.

   A former lawmaker from Italy's neo-fascist
party was formally charged on Wednesday in connection with a train
bombing that killed 16 people and wounded 266 in 1984.
   Massimo Abbatangelo, who served in the Chamber of Deputies for
the Italian Social Movement from 1979 to 1987, was charged with
causing a massacre, joining an armed band, bombing with terrorist
and subversive ends, and possession of explosives.
   He was detained in Naples on Oct. 10 after a year as a fugitive,
but the formal arrest warrant and charges were filed Wednesday by
investigative magistrate Claudio Lo Curto.
   Nine other people are on trial for the bombing in Florence. The
bomb exploded Dec. 23, 1984, on an express train traveling between
Naples and Milan.
   Authorities say the bombing was carried out by right-wing
terrorists and the Mafia in an attempt to destabilize the country.

   The Soviet Union will release all people regarded
in the West as political prisoners by the end of the year,
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany said Wednesday after talks
with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Such a dramatic move would be one of the boldest signs yet from
Gorbachev that he seeks a clear break with past Kremlin human rights
practices that have included imprisonment of dissenters from
Communist Party policy.
   However, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov refused
to confirm or deny that a release of political prisoners is imminent.
   He told reporters there are about two dozen such prisoners.
Estimates from human rights groups abroad vary from 150 to more than
500.
   Gerasimov said the fate of the prisoners was not on the agenda of
the Soviet-West German negotiations that brought Kohl to Moscow.
   Kohl's announcement was welcomed by Soviet human rights activist
Andrei D. Sakharov, President Reagan and Amnesty International. But
a leader of a group seeking emigration of Soviet Jews said he
remained skeptical.
   Reagan, asked what he thought of the report, said, ``I'm hoping
that's true.''
   Sakharov, the 1975 Nobel Peace laureate, said, ``Certainly we
await the release of all of them (prisoners) and their
rehabilitation.''
   In the past three days, Kohl held 10 hours of talks with
Gorbachev and also met with other top Kremlin officials.
   At a news conference called to sum up his visit, Kohl said: ``The
Soviets confirmed that they will release before the end of the year
all political prisoners as we understand it in the West.''
   Kohl would not say whether the promise came from Gorbachev, only
that it was made during the talks.
   Asked how many people may be freed, Kohl's foreign minister,
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, said: ``We are not in a position to give
final figures.''
   Neither Kohl nor Genscher identified prisoners who might be
released. It was not clear how many Soviets classified in the West
as political prisoners might be freed, since some have been
sentenced on criminal charges, including espionage.
   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group, says
it knows of 150 Soviets ``imprisoned solely for their non-violent
exercise of their fundamental human rights.'' It put their number at
10,000 a few years ago.
   Amnesty's list includes about 30 religious believers, 30
conscientious objectors to military service, and about 20 people
held for anti-Soviet propaganda and other offenses, said spokeswoman
Carline Windall.
   Upon request, Amnesty's New York office named four people on the
list of 150 believed to be prisoners of conscience:
   Levko Lukyanenko, a Ukrainian lawyer and member of an unofficial
Helsinki Watch committee, in internal exile in the Soviet Union;
Boris Mityashin, a Leningrad truck driver, imprisoned for
distributing poetry disapproved of by the government; Vazif
Meylanov, in a labor camp since 1980 for demonstrating for
Sakharov's release, and Enn Tarto, an Estonian, also held in a labor
camp.
   Kronid Lubarsky, editor of Country and World, the respected
emigre publication in Munich, said there are at least 167 Soviet
political prisoners.
   A West German group, the International Society for Human Rights,
said 503 Soviets are imprisoned on political or religious grounds.
   Many of those sent to labor camp or prisons for political
offenses have been convicted under two clauses of the Soviet
Criminal Code.
   Article 70 outlaws ``anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda.''
Article 190 forbids ``anti-Soviet slander.''
   ``The only number we know is (those held under Article) 70, and
only those in camps,'' Sakharov said in a telephone interview. He
put the total number of those prisoners at 25.
   ``We don't know who is in psychiatric hospitals,'' said Sakharov,
who was kept almost seven years in internal exile for condemning the
1979 Soviet military push into Afghanistan.
   Sakharov said it was also not known how many were imprisoned for
violating laws that regulate the practice of religion.
   Sergei I. Grigoryants, one of the first political prisoners
released under an amnesty last year, said in an interview that he
has a list of 200 people put in camps or psychiatric hospitals for
their political beliefs.
   He said he was skeptical of Kohl's announcement. ``When
authorities themselves decide who is a political prisoner, it's
difficult to believe that all will really be freed,'' said
Grigoryants, editor of Glasnost, an unsanctioned political journal.
   In New York, the chairman of the National Conference on Soviet
Jewry, Morris Abram, also said he was skeptical.
   ``One will have to wait to see whether or not the promise is
confirmed by the practice,'' Abram told The Associated Press.
   Last year, authorities freed at least 300 prisoners being held on
charges including Articles 70 and 190. The ruling Communist Party
and government are reviewing the Soviet penal code.
   ``We are going to make some real innovations,'' Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze said in Paris on Oct. 11. ``When the code is
published and debated, there will no longer be any need to speak of
political prisoners.''
   Shevardnadze said ``about 25 to 29'' Soviets were also confined
to mental institutions, apparently for political offenses.
   For decades, the Kremlin's image in the West has been tarnished
by the use of prisons, labor camps, mental hospitals and internal
exile to isolate and punish dissenters or political and religious
activists.

   The director of the police training council that
supervised an academy where 16 cadets were hospitalized from
exhaustion stepped down Wednesday amid a series of investigations.
   Gary F. Egan, executive director of the Massachusetts Criminal
Justice Training Council, was placed on leave of absence until the
state attorney general's office determines what felled cadets at the
police academy in Agawam.
   A statement issued by the council said Egan ``felt his continued
presence in the midst of press attention was interfering with the
agency's ability to carry out its job of training police throughout
the commonwealth.''
   At least 16 recruits in a class of 50 were hospitalized with
dehydration, exhaustion and kidney failure by the end of the first
week of training at the western Massachusetts academy last month.
One recruit had a liver transplant and was in a coma for two weeks.
   Public Safety Secretary Charles V. Barry asked Egan to take the
leave from his $53,000-a-year job, according to sources in the state
Executive Office of Public Safety, which is monitoring the council.
   Attorney General James M. Shannon has been investigating what
caused the cadets to collapse and what role was played by the
physical and stress training program they were undergoing. In
addition, a panel appointed by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis is reviewing
the council's training procedures.
   Shannon also is investigating reports of financial and hiring
improprieties on the staff of the 24-member council, which is
comprised of police, sheriff, corrections and other law enforcement
officials.
   The council runs five of 15 police training centers in the state,
including the Agawam facility. It certifies and provides technical
assistance to the other 10, which are operated by local or county
law enforcement agencies.
   The Agawam academy was closed Sept. 21 for the investigation.
Cadets are being trained at a National Guard barracks in Agawam.

<DATELINE>GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The tremendous publicity given to the
rescue of whales stranded off Alaska has some people questioning the
relative values of animal and human life, the president of the
University of Notre Dame said.
   The Rev. Edward ``Monk'' Malloy told about 300 people at a
``social concern forum'' Tuesday that he was an animal lover, but
that the rescue attempts are ``more of a public relations effort to
appease certain elements in the ecology movement, to show that the
government cares.''
   Malloy cited the whale rescue, along with longstanding social
concerns such as abortion and hunger in the world, as issues members
of the audience should use to help examine their ethics in a context
of being part of a global community.
   ``We realize we are one in the midst of many and we have to ask,
`Can we hone in on one issue or a set of interconnected issues?'''
   Malloy said that well-meaning people caught up by one concern
should not overlook related problems.
   He noted that civil strife and corrupt governments in Africa
sometimes divert aid offered by people moved by heart-wrenching
photographs of starving children.
   ``So, in the efforts to deal with the broad-based concerns of
hunger, good will alone will not help, and we should be prudent,''
Malloy said.
   Malloy argued that even in the drive against abortion, which is a
major concern of the Roman Catholic Church he serves, it is
important to look beyond a single issue.
   ``Being pro-life has served as a rallying cry for some
Christians,'' he said. ``But pro-life should include more than life
in the womb. Concern should also be given to the life of an infant,
the life of the elderly and the life of the mentally, physically and
spiritually handicapped.''

<HEAD>Tribunal Excommunicates Gay Priest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Roman Catholic priest who advocated a more
compassionate view of homosexuality and later revealed that he was
gay has been excommunicated by a church tribunal for joining the
Episcopal Church.
   The tribunal dismissed William Dorn Jr. from the ``clerical
state'' and banned him from the priesthood forever. It found him
guilty of leaving the Vatican-ruled church in favor of the
Britain-based Protestant denomination.
   The ruling puts an end to a two-year public dispute in which Dorn
and the Roman Catholic Church clashed over his outspoken challenges
to church teachings on homosexuality and his ultimate revelation
that he is gay.
   ``It's over,'' said Dorn, 36, after learning of the ruling
Tuesday.
   The tribunal's ruling was dated Sept. 30 and delivered Tuesday to
Dorn by his church-appointed lawyer, the Rev. James Zusy of the
Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis. Dorn said that he was not
allowed to keep a copy of the decree and was ordered not to speak
about it.
   However, he notified the media and issued a statement critical of
the church hierarchy. Zusy refused to discuss the matter, saying,
``I cannot say a word. I am bound to secrecy.''
   Former St. Cloud Bishop George Speltz suspended, then fired Dorn
from his job at the Christ Church Newman Center at St. Cloud State
University in October 1986.
   Speltz was angered by a controversial article Dorn had written
for the St. Cloud Visitor, the diocesan newspaper. The article
advocated a more compassionate view of homosexuality, which Dorn
called a ``gift from God.''
   In June, the three-member tribunal met in Park Rapids at the
order of Bishop Victor Balke of Crookston, where Dorn was ordained
in 1979.
   Dorn on several occasions declined an invitation to come back to
the church on the condition he remain silent about homosexuality.
   Commenting on the church's action, Dorn said that by silencing
priests who challenge traditional doctrine, church officials are
losing touch with people and closing doors on the oppressed.
   ``In fear, (church officials) cling to the vestiges of power,''
he said. ``They speak only to themselves, and so believe they are
mighty.''
   Dorn, who lives in south Minneapolis, declined to discuss his
personal life or possible plans to seek ordination in the Episcopal
Church.

   President Reagan late Wednesday lauded the
efforts of the crew members of two Soviet icebreakers, among others,
for their work leading to the freeing of two whales trapped in the
Arctic ice.
   ``I am gratified that the California gray whales have been
released to the open sea,'' Reagan said in a statement read by Mark
Weinberger, a White House spokesman.
   ``The human persistence and determination by so many individuals
on behalf of these whales shows mankind's concern for the
environment,'' he said. ``It has been an inspiring endeavor.
   ``We thank and congratulate the crews of the two Soviet
icebreakers who finally broke through to the whales. They were part
of a remarkable team effort _ by governments, individuals and
business. Due to all these efforts, the whales have returned to the
sea.''
   The whales that had been imprisoned nearly three weeks were
headed out to open sea Wednesday after two Soviet ice-breaking
vessels smashed a pathway to them from the sea.
   Breathing holes had been cut for the whales by Americans working
in the opposite direction.
   A third whale that also had been trapped is believed to have died
last week.

   The Indiana Supreme Court rejected two
requests Wednesday to open the application of Republican vice
presidential nominee Dan Quayle to become a member of the Indiana
bar.
   A Wisconsin attorney and The Indianapolis News had made separate
requests for the application under the Indiana Public Records Law.
   The document, entitled the ``Application for Admission Upon
Examination to Practice Law in the Supreme Court of Indiana,''
contains several questions asking whether the applicant has been
dishonest or had academic difficulties.
   Questions have been raised repeatedly about the Indiana senator's
academic performance since he was selected as the running mate to
Vice President George Bush.
   Supreme Court Administrator Karl Mulvaney Wednesday said the full
court decided not to release the record in keeping with its past
policies. The Public Records law exempts records ``declared
confidential by or under rules adopted by the supreme court of
Indiana.''

   Far-right white candidates
scored major gains Wednesday, but black militants also showed their
political strength by boycotting the first same-day voting by all
races for segregated municipal councils.
   In major black townships, where anti-apartheid activists urged a
boycott in defiance of state-of-emergency regulations, turnouts
generally were below 10 percent.
   The government said the total black turnout, including advance
votes, would exceed the 21 percent recorded in the previous black
elections in 1983.
   But in Soweto, whose 2 million residents comprise the largest
black community in South Africa, election officials acknowledged
their disappointment at an overall turnout of 11.5 percent.
   The government's Bureau for Information said 30 percent of the
25,428 eligible black voters turned out in Natal, one of the four
provinces.
   Black and white polling stations were heavily guarded by security
forces. No serious violence was reported, although police said
scattered arson and stone-throwing attacks did occur.
   President P.W. Botha's National Party faced a fierce challenge
from the extreme-right Conservative Party, which entered local
elections for the first time since it was formed eight years ago.
Many white communities had their first partisan local elections
after decades of Nationalist dominance.
   The most important white battleground was Pretoria, the
administrative capital, where the Nationalists won 22 of 42 council
seats and the Conservatives 19. The other seat went to an
independent.
   In the port city of Durban, right-wing candidates opposed to the
integration of beaches won two seats from incumbents on the
traditionally liberal city council.
   In Johannesburg, the largest city, the National Party gained
outright control at the expense of liberal candidates. The
Conservatives decisively beat a Nationalist candidate in Mayfair
West, a blue-collar ward where non-whites have been moving in
violation of segregation laws.
   ``This shows our people reject the government's move to the
left,'' said the Conservative victor, Hendrick Classen. ``We want
white areas.''
   The Conservatives also swept to power in most rural northern
towns and traded victories with the Nationalists in blue-collar
urban areas. Final results were expected Thursday.
   Nationwide, 7,229 seats were at stake in 1,071 communities. The
state radio said only 905 of the 1,839 black council seats were
being contested, with no candidates for 138 seats.
   Of South Africa's 26 million blacks, 1,464,198 were eligible to
vote in contested elections. Polling hours varied, with the earliest
voting at 7 a.m. and the final balloting at 9 p.m.
   Anti-apartheid clergymen such as Anglican Archbishop Desmond
Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, opposed the elections
and urged South Africans to fast and pray during the day.
   The United Nations General Assembly voted 146-0 on Wednesday to
condemn the elections. The United States and Britain abstained.
   The government spent millions of dollars on advertising to
promote a high turnout, contending that it was broadening democracy
even though blacks cannot vote in national elections.
   Critics say turnout percentages will have little meaning because
millions of blacks were ineligible to vote. Many leading black
opposition groups are banned.
   One black who did vote, Siza Zwane, said national issues didn't
prompt him to vote for the Sofasonke Party, whose candidates in
Soweto have been criticized for making sweeping promises.
   ``We are going to pay less rent, and they will make the roads
much better,'' Zwane said.
   Many schools in black, mixed-race and Asian townships near
Johannesburg and Cape Town were virtually deserted as students
stayed away to protest the elections.
   The Conservative Party won 26 percent of the vote in May 1987
national elections. Its leaders believe they could seriously
challenge the National Party in parliamentary elections expected by
1990.
   The Conservatives view Botha's gradual race reforms as
capitulation to the black majority and seek to reimpose strict
segregation. Under apartheid, the 5 million whites control the
economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
   The Conservatives want to toughen enforcement of residential
segregation and restrict blacks' presence in urban areas.
   They campaigned on these issues even though they could not
implement them unless they ended the National Party's 40-year hold
on national power.
   Municipal councils can evict squatters and segregate parks,
public buildings and transportation facilities.
   Bombings and grenade attacks have averaged more than one a day in
South Africa since September. Police say the attacks were part of a
campaign by African National Congress guerrillas to disrupt the
elections.

   Lebanon hostage Terry Anderson marks his
41st birthday Thursday as he has his last three: in the hands of
Shiite Moslem kidnappers.
   Half a world away, people in his home state will use the day to
press for his freedom.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest held U.S. hostage. He was snatched March 16,
1985, off the streets of Beirut by pro-Iranian extremists who have
issued numerous threats against his life.
   To mark the day, a radio station and merchants group in
Anderson's hometown of Batavia are sponsoring a birthday party with
a huge cake decorated with 1,321 candles, one for each day of the
journalist's captivity.
   Organizers are freezing a portion of the cake to give Anderson
when he is freed.
   ``The community hasn't forgot him,'' said Terri Fritz of radio
station WBAT.
   Many residents of the small city of 17,000 also will put lighted
candles in their windows for Anderson, she said.
   At Buffalo State College, students will hold a rally on
Anderson's behalf.
   ``We see it as a chance to sensitize students to the issues of
freedom,'' said journalism professor Paul DeWald. ``Terry is Joe
America to us and we have to stand up for him.''
   Students will wear armbands with Anderson's name and sign a huge
birthday card that will be forwarded to Lebanon, DeWald said.
   In Catskill, south of Albany, parishioners of St. Patrick's Roman
Catholic Church plan a prayer service for Anderson.
   The Rev. Bedde Ferrara, an organizer of the event, also said
children from Catholic schools have written letters to Anderson that
will be given to Anderson's sister, Peggy Say.
   Mrs. Say attended a children's church ceremony for the hostages
in Buffalo on Tuesday. At the ceremony, she said she had learned
from a French hostage that Anderson was hoping to be released before
the presidential election.
   ``He's got himself geared up for a release before the election,''
she said. ``If it doesn't come he's going to be terribly
disappointed.''

   A federal courtroom rocked to Creedence
Clearwater Revival records Wednesday as lawyers for former lead
singer John Fogerty tried to show that a song from his 1985 comeback
album wasn't stolen from another Fogerty hit.
   Fantasy Records, which recorded Creedence, has filed suit
essentially accusing Fogerty of plagiarizing himself.
   The suit against Fogerty and his current recording company,
Warner Bros. Records Inc., contends ``Old Man Down the Road,'' a
single from Fogerty's solo ``Centerfield'' album, copied the melody
from ``Run Through the Jungle,'' which Fogerty wrote and sang for
Creedence in 1970 and to which Fantasy now owns the rights.
   Relations between Fogerty and his former recording company have
been bitter since Creedence disbanded in 1972. Fogerty had to change
the title of one song in ``Centerfield'' after Saul Zaentz, owner of
Fantasy Records, said he was being libeled.
   In the current case, the two songs are similar in tune and
structure, as lawyers for Fantasy demonstrated earlier this week in
testimony by musicologists equipped with charts, a piano and a
computer sound system that superimposed one pattern of notes on
another.
   A defense musicologist for Warner Bros. guided the U.S. District
Court jurors through a series of Creedence records _ ``Green
River,'' ``Keep on Chooglin','' ``Tombstone Shadow'' and ``Bootleg''
_ with his own series of elaborate charts pointing out similarities
to ``Run Through the Jungle'' and ``Old Man Down the Road.''
   The six jurors and four alternates, who appeared to range from
about 30 to their 60s, listened to the late 1960s-early 1970s medley
with serious expressions and varied postures _ one middle-aged man
yawned at one point, while several jurors nodded in time to the beat.
   The defense witness, Harold Barlow, who described himself as a
``music plagiarism expert'' as well as a songwriter and arranger,
said all the songs had many notes in common.
   ``He (Fogerty) is working with an idea,'' Barlow said. ``The idea
is to use B-flat and C in a repetitive structure. ... Mr. Fogerty
has made this structure commonplace. The way he uses them, the
expression of the idea, they're used differently.''
   Under cross-examination, Barlow acknowledged that he had compared
the two songs early in the case, without examining any other songs,
and concluded they were ``substantially similar,'' the standard that
determines copyright infringement.
   But he insisted that a valid comparison must also take into
account earlier works that might have influenced later compositions;
in light of those, ``Old Man Down the Road'' can't be considered a
copy of the 1970 song, Barlow said.
   Fogerty testified briefly Monday and is scheduled to appear again
Friday.
   In pretrial statements read into the record Wednesday by lawyers
for Fantasy, Fogerty said several of his songs, including the two
involved in the case, used ``similar phrasing.''
   But he added in the statement, ``As far as I'm concerned, the two
songs are totally different.''

   A woman shot in the mouth by her husband in a
struggle over whether to kill the family dog asked a judge for
leniency for her husband, saying the shooting had strengthened their
marriage.
   East Central District Judge Cynthia Rothe on Tuesday gave Paul
Dickelman a one-year suspended jail sentence on his reckless
endangerment conviction. He also must perform 200 hours of community
service work and will be on two years' probation.
   Dickelman, 31, who spent five days in jail after the shooting in
June, had suffered enough, said his wife, Danelle, 27, of rural
Horace.
   He had been drinking and planned to shoot the dog because it
urinated on their carpet. During a struggle over the .22-caliber
pistol, Mrs. Dickelman was shot, said John Goff, an assistant Cass
County state's attorney.
   Mrs. Dickelman said her husband has since sought help for a
drinking problem and the couple ``were trying to turn this ... into
a positive thing.''

<TEXT>
   At least 179 people who abandoned a
ship sunk by Typhoon Ruby swam or rode lifeboats for hours in
mountainous seas to reach safety on small islands, officials said
Thursday.
   The Dona Marilyn sank Monday with more than 500 people aboard.
   The discovery of survivors on remote islands lifted the hopes of
rescue workers, who have found the bodies of at least 32 people.
Other reports put the death toll at 26.
   Carlos Go, president of the shipping company that owned the Dona
Marilyn, said 138 of the survivors had been put aboard another
company vessel and were expected to arrive in Tacloban Thursday.
   Others remained on small islands near where the 2,855-ton Dona
Marilyn sank. The vessel was on a Manila-Tacloban run when it sank
in heavy seas and high winds about 300 miles southeast of the
capital.
   Go said he hoped more survivors would be found.
   ``There are plenty of islands in the area,'' and the search was
continuing Thursday, he said.
   Survivors told how people rushed into lifeboats or dived
overboard as the vessel heaved in storm-whipped seas and sank.
   In Manila, people jammed the offices of Sulpicio Lines, which
owned the ship, seeking information about relatives who were aboard.
   Virginia Tamban, whose sister and two nieces were passengers,
said she would remain overnight to see if their names appeared on
the list of survivors. ``I hope they are safe,'' she sobbed. She
said none of them knew how to swim.
   Raymundo Adejer, 27, said his sister, Natividad, and her
4-year-old son were on the vessel, although the boy's name was not
on the manifest.
   ``I cannot blame anyone for this except the captain of the ship
who still sailed despite reports that a storm was coming up,''
Adejer said.
   President Corazon Aquino on Wednesday declared a state of
calamity in Manila and 35 provinces hardest hit by Typhoon Ruby.
   The Red Cross and other relief agencies said 114 people were
killed on land by the typhoon, which pummeled the entire archipelago
nation with heavy rains and winds Monday and Tuesday before heading
west toward China.
   The Red Cross said more than 765,000 Filipinos were affected by
Ruby, meaning their homes were destroyed, damaged or flooded or
sustained other losses. The government said the storm caused $45
million in damage to crops and destroyed $7.5 million worth of roads
and bridges.
   Bernardo Cabigon, Sulpicio's station manager in Tacloban, quoted
surviving crewmembers of the Dona Marilyn as saying they briefly
tried to pump water from the ship as it listed to one side.
   ``After they found out they could not do anything anymore, they
decided to get off,'' he said. ``Everybody was jumping into the sea.
Others took the lifeboats. But there were so many people that they
decided to jump and swim. They looked very tired. They stayed in the
water for three hours.''
   Cabigon quoted survivors as saying that some passengers were so
frightened they claimed they saw an island nearby and swam toward
it, although the storm had reduced visibility to nearly zero at the
time.
   He quoted survivor Alberto Oledo as saying he jumped overboard
with his wife, son and daughter. The three held hands but were
separated in the raging seas, and Oledo was the only who reached
land.
   Cabigon said 120 of the 179 survivors managed to reach the remote
island of Almagro in lifejackets and life boats.
   Go said 26 bodies were recovered, but the Coast Guard put the
figure at 32. There was no explanation for the discrepancy.
   The Dona Marilyn was trying to maneuver to the western side of
Masbate island, away from Ruby's approach to the east, but was
buffeted by strong waves and winds of up to 140 mph, Cabigon said.
   The coast guard said the skipper reported the vessel listing to
the port side in heavy seas in a radio distress signal before the
ship went down.
   Mrs. Aquino told reporters she ordered an investigation of the
sinking. ``I'm telling (the transportation minister) to investigate
this and find out why they still sailed during very bad weather.''
   Go said he could not explain why the vessel sailed Sunday,
despite the approach of the typhoon, because he was unable to
interview surviving crew members.
   In December, another Sulpicio ship, the Dona Paz, collided with
an oil tanker off Mindoro island. The official death toll was 1,749,
but other estimates said more than 3,000 were killed. Only 28 people
survived.

   A federal judge has fined a company and one of
its employees for smuggling counterfeit Cabbage Patch and Rainbow
Brite dolls into the country from Taiwan.
   U.S. District Judge John R. Hargrove on Tuesday fined Louis
DeSimone, 41, an agent for Jayce International, of Willowick, Ohio,
$50,000 and imposed a $35,000 fine on the company, which imports and
distributes children's toys.
   The maximum penalty for smuggling is a $250,000 fine.
   DeSimone and Jayce International pleaded guilty last month to
charges of smuggling the dolls into the country. The dolls were not
properly declared to U.S. Customs officials.
   The company has not been licensed by Appalachian Artworks, which
holds the copyright to Cabbage Patch dolls, to sell the dolls in the
United States.
   During a routine search on May 8, 1986, customs agents discovered
3,252 Cabbage Patch dolls and 227 Rainbow Brite dolls hidden behind
boxes of electric fans, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Susan M.
Ringler.

<HEAD>Anne Frank Letter to American Pen Pals to Go to Wiesenthal Center</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Letters written by Anne Frank and her sister
to two American girls in 1940 will be given to the Simon Wiesenthal
Center's new museum by an anonymous donor who bought them at auction
for $150,000.
   The letters will be featured prominently near the entrance of the
Beit Hashoah Museum of Tolerance when it opens in 1989 and may also
be displayed on world tours, Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the center's
associate dean, said Wednesday.
   ``We were pleasantly surprised and honored that we were thought
of and were given what we considered a historic opportunity,''
Cooper said. The letters ``should not be somewhere in a drawer or a
vault.''
   The letters, auctioned by Swann Galleries in New York on Tuesday,
had been kept for decades by Betty Ann and Juanita Wagner, sisters
who corresponded with the Frank girls as pen pals just before Nazi
Germany invaded The Netherlands.
   The Franks, who were Jewish, hid in an Amsterdam attic for two
years until they were discovered and sent to concentration camps.
Anne, born in 1929, died at Belsen in 1945. Her father, Otto, was
the family's only survivor.
   Wiesenthal, a famed Nazi hunter, tracked down and arrested Karl
Silberbauer, the Gestapo agent who arrested the Frank family, Cooper
said. Silberbauer was not convicted of any crime, however, and
continued working as a police inspector in Vienna, Austria.
   Anne's poignant diary of life in hiding was published in 1947 and
was later made into a play and a movie titled ``The Diary of Anne
Frank.''
   Betty Ann and Juanita Wagner wrote to Anne and Margot Frank in
1940 at the suggestion of a teacher in their hometown, Danville,
Iowa. At the time, Anne and Juanita were 11; Margot and Betty Ann
were 15.
   Anne and Margot sent back two photographs, a postcard and two
letters describing their life in Amsterdam. Margot wrote that
``having a frontier with Germany and being a small country we never
feel safe.''
   The Wagners wrote back, but there was no reply. A month after the
letters were sent, Germany invaded The Netherlands.
   ``We'd worried about her during the war, but never dreamed she
was suffering,'' said Betty Ann Wagner, reached at her home in the
Los Angeles area.
   The letters give insight into Anne Frank's personality, Cooper
said.
   ``It gives a good exposure into the young girl. There isn't that
much that deals with the tragedies of her life, but it gives a good
sense for who the person was,'' he said.

   David Dorr, the ringleader of a white
supremacist group that modeled itself on The Order and launched a
series of bombings, was sentenced Wednesday to up to 20 years in
prison.
   Two other members of The Order II were sentenced to eight years
in prison, but a third defendant was placed on probation. Deborah
Dorr, 36, Dorr's wife, and Edward Hawley, 24, were both ordered to
jail. Hawley's wife, Olive, 29, was given a six-year prison
sentence, but it was suspended to five years probation.
   The Dorr-Hawley group, described as ``The Order II'' or ``Bruder
Schweigen Task Force'' in documents found in the Dorr home, was
apparently a small group modeled on the militant white supremacist
group The Order.
   The Order was a violent offshoot of the white supremacist Aryan
Nations organization at Hayden Lake, which is 30 miles northeast of
Spokane, Wash.
   Twenty-three members of the original Order were indicted in
Seattle on racketeering charges. Twelve pleaded guilty to various
charges in the indictment while 10 others were convicted in December
1985. A 23rd person is imprisoned in Missouri on other convictions.
   Prosecutors in Seattle alleged The Order staged a string of
crimes, including bank and armored car robberies, in late 1983 and
1984 in a plot to overthrow the governemnt and establish an Aryan
homeland in the Northwest.
   The Dorrs and Hawleys were indicted by a federal grand jury
earlier this year on counts of racketeering, conspiracy,
counterfeiting, bombing, illegal possession of automatic weapons and
malicious destruction of federal property.
   They also face separate state charges in the bombings. A trial is
tentatively scheduled for early next year.
   In all but one case, U.S. District Judge Harold Ryan went along
with a plea-bargain agreement between the defendants and the U.S.
Justice Department. The defendants all pleaded guilty.
   Prosecutors recommended up to 12 years for Hawley, but Ryan cut
that by a third.
   ``I think there is hope for you,'' Ryan told Hawley. ``I feel
that you have been a follower, and you followed your way into a
whole heap of trouble.''
   In September 1986, a series of explosions rocked the Coeur
d'Alene area in northern Idaho. One of the blasts damaged the home
of a Roman Catholic priest active in human rights work and another
damaged the federal building in Coeur d'Alene. There were no
injuries.
   Dorr and Hawley already are serving a four-year sentence in an
Arizona prison on a federal counterfeiting conviction in Washington
state. Ryan gave them credit for time served since their arrests two
years ago.
   The sentences handed down Wednesday were made concurrent with the
previous convictions.
   Court officials said Dorr, 37, could be eligiible for
consideration for parole in four to five years and Hawley in two
years.
   Mrs. Dorr probably will have to serve at least one-third of her
eight-year sentence, a defense attorney said.

   Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd
Bentsen said Wednesday evening the Republicans had run a ``miserable
campaign'' of distortions which Michael Dukakis did not address
until after it hurt the Democratic ticket.
   Bentsen, appearing on the CBS Evening News, said he did not think
George Bush was a racist, but he reiterated his opinion that the ads
Bush was sanctioning were.
   ``I think what we have seen is a miserable campaign,'' he said.
   ``What he's allowing to be done is ... hypocrisy at work,'' he
said, complaining that Bush allows his advisers to distort the
truth. ``Now, he ought to root those things out.''
   Bentsen cited the Republicans' use of ads showing pictures of
Willie Horton, a black Massachusetts prisoner who escaped on
furlough and was convicted of raping a white Maryland woman. ``In
this instance, you've seen how they've used his photograph over and
over and over again,'' he said.
   Asked by CBS anchorman Dan Rather if the Democrats were being
opportunistic themselves, Bentsen said they were in fact slow to
respond.
   ``Dan, They started immediately after that Democratic convention,
and Frankly I thought they should have been answered then,'' he
said. ``But my friend Mike Dukakis was incredulous, he just didn't
believe that sort of charges with the distortions could stick.
   ``But they have and they have hurt. And that's one of the reasons
we're in the kind of a race we're in now.''
   Rather asked Bentsen how often he himself had met with Jesse
Jackson, and Bentsen said they had participated recently in a joint
satellite session with college students. The two men were in
separate cities for that event.
   Bentsen also said he planned to appear with Jackson this week.
Campaign officials said afterward the event was still tentative
because of Jackson's schedule.
   On the stump in California, where the CBS broadcast originated,
Bentsen moved on from hitting at Bush's campaign advertising and
trained his sights again Wednesday at Bush's running mate, Dan
Quayle.
   ``I think millions of Americans would agree that Dan Quayle is
not qualified to be president'' if he had to step into the job,
Bentsen told a crowd at a Riverside outdoor plaza.
   Bentsen's appearance came hours before he was scheduled to appear
on CBS as part of a strategy by the presidential campaign of Michael
Dukakis to get as much television exposure as possible.
   Bentsen ridiculed the Republican campaign for saying Quayle would
head up a Bush administration war on drugs and lead the U.S. space
program.
   As for Quayle's assertion that he would have a major influence on
national defense policy, Bentsen said: ``That's a frightening
thought. Are you ready for that?''
   There was an enthusiastic response from the noontime crowd. Mike
McCurry, Bentsen's press secretary, said Quayle was a bigger issue
in California than in most other states according to the campaign's
poll.
   ``We need to keep that issue in front of the voters,'' McCurry
said.
   Bentsen arrived in California after a swing through Montana and
the Dakotas, moving from states with the fewest electoral votes to
the one with the most.
   ``This is the big banana. This is the one we have to win,'' he
said.
   The rally, complete with two high school bands, cheerleaders and
balloons was in part a warmup for an unprecedented television blitz
by the campaign using Bentsen.
   The candidate was taping a five-minute television commercial in
Los Angeles Wednesday which the Democratic campaign plans to air
nationwide on Sunday night. Never has a presidential campaign bought
commercial time to feature its vice presidential candidate.
   The campaign has purchased a five-minute block on the ABC
television network on Sunday night.
   Bentsen will ``be talking about correcting the record, stating
the case ... the things he's been talking about so eloquently out on
the stump,'' said Tad Devine, who coordinates Bentsen's campaign and
is a top adviser for Dukakis.
   The Democrats are counting on a major get-out-the-vote effort on
Election Day to help carry key states, and it is necessary to keep
up enthusiasm in the face of polls showing the ticket trailing, he
said.
   Since Bentsen was chosen, he has been a consistent asset for
Dukakis and has proven himself a likeable candidate, Devine said.
Since the debate against Quayle and especially in the past few days,
``This vice presidential part of the campaign is becoming much more
salient,'' he said.
   In addition to taping the five-minute spot and his appearance on
the CBS Evening News, Bentsen plans to make additional footage that
could be used in commercials in the final week of the race. A joint
commercial spot with Dukakis also was possible before Election Day,
Devine said.
   Bentsen's appearance with Dan Rather demonstrated to voters that
he was capable of meeting with the press and public and his
Republican counterpart was not, Devine said.
   ``Let's face it, the Republicans wouldn't dream of putting Dan
Quayle on a set with Dan Rather or anybody else,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Nicaragua's former minister of culture has been
denied a visa to go on a speaking tour of universities around the
United States, the State Department said Wednesday.
   Frances Jones, a department spokeswoman, said Ernesto Cardinale's
request for a visa was rejected under two sections of the
Immigration and Naturalization Act.
   One section prohibits foreigners from receiving a visa if they
had previously obtained one under false pretenses; another bars
anyone who has been associated with the Communist Party from
obtaining a visa.
   Jones said she did not know specifically why Cardinale's request
for a visa was turned down.
   ``I don't have details on this and I don't know the
particulars,'' she said.
   But she said the department's decision was unrelated to a
proclamation signed Tuesday by President Reagan. Reagan said the
United States will no longer grant entry visas to officials of
Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government because such visits were
``detrimental to the interests of the United States.''
   The proclamation was partly in retaliation for new restrictions
placed on U.S. government officials in Nicaragua last month.
Relations between the two countries have been particularly strained
since last July 11 when Managua expelled the American ambassador,
and the United States retaliated.
   The Sandinista party newspaper Barricada, in its Wednesday
editions, ran a last page story under the headline: ``The U.S.
Declares Visa War.''
   The article charged that the denial of official visas was linked
to ``an old plan by the Central Intelligence Agency to try to
isolate Nicaragua.''
   Cardinale's original itinerary called for him to speak
universities around the country in late October and early November.
   Last month, Ronald M. McAllister, associate dean of Northeastern
University in Boston, wrote Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., asking him to
``exert some pressure'' to encourage the issuance of Cardinale's
visa so the Nicaraguan could speak on Nov. 3.
   McAllister said he was disturbed about the delay in the visa
process. ``Mr. Cardinale is a well-known figure who has been to this
country before and for whom the process of a visa cannot be
difficult, time-consuming or labor-intensive,'' the dean wrote.

<HEAD>University Transplant Surgeon Sues News Sources</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A heart-lung transplant surgeon at the
University of Minnesota filed a defamation lawsuit against a
newspaper's unidentified sources who said he ordered an operation on
a patient already considered dead.
   The suit, filed Tuesday in Hennepin County District Court,
centers on a story that appeared in the Star Tribune Aug. 2. The
story said the university was investigating an allegation that Dr.
Stuart Jamieson ordered an associate to perform a bypass operation
on a patient who was considered dead before the surgery began.
   Two days later, in a front page note to readers, the newspaper
said it regretted having published the account because the sources
for it did not have firsthand information.
   The suit is designed to enable Jamieson's attorneys to serve
subpoenas and take sworn statements from people at the University of
Minnesota Hospital who may be the sources or know who they are.
   The surgeon on the case, Dr. Jolene Kriett, has said the Aug. 2
report was wrong. She said Jamieson had not ordered the operation,
that it was not bypass surgery but the installation of a left
ventricular assist device to help the patient's failing heart and
that the patient was alive when she operated.
   Thomas Forsythe, a spokesman for Jamieson's lawyer Terence Fruth,
said Tuesday that if attorneys learn the identity of the sources
they would be named publicly as defendants in the suit.
   The suit alleges that the sources ``have and continue to cause
great damage'' to Jamieson's reputation. It asks that a court award
him unspecified damages.
   Jamieson was suspended as chief of cardiovascular surgery and
director of the university's Minnesota Heart and Lung Institute on
Aug. 3, and stripped of the two titles Sept. 19. Dr. David Brown,
dean of the medical school, said the decisions were based on
``interpersonal management'' failures. Jamieson still is authorized
to perform surgery.
   According to correspondence released with the suit, the newspaper
has turned down Fruth's request for the identity of the sources and
the university has declined to join Jamieson in asking the newspaper
to release the names.
   Joel Kramer, executive editor of the Star Tribune, said Tuesday
that the paper has no intention of revealing its sources, as a
matter of policy. Breaking a promise of confidentiality made to
sources could shut off future sources of information, he said.

<TEXT>
   Requiring Amish people to display
slow-moving vehicle signs on their horse-drawn buggies desecrates
their religion, an attorney argued Wednesday in asking a judge to
dismiss citations against 15 defendants.
   The 15 were cited for failure to obey a state law requiring them
to display the triangular warning signs on the rear of their
buggies. In the dark or fog, the signs must be reflective orange,
and the Amish shun bright colors.
   Attorney Philip Villaume of St. Paul told Fillmore County
District Judge Clement Snyder that the Amish recognize the state's
interest in safety on public roadways and are willing to use
reflective tape and lanterns.
   Prosecutor Matt Opat has said the public safety issues outweigh
any infringement the law may have on the defendants' constitutional
right of religious freedom.
   Lee Zook, 42, a professor at Luther College in Decorah, Iowa,
testified as an expert on the Amish that slow-moving vehicle signs
are an ``intrusion into their life. This has nothing to do with
being symbolic of being God's people,'' which the Amish believe they
are, Zook said.
   Amish are opposed to bright colors because they draw attention to
themselves, Zook said. He said they put their trust in God and that
they know traveling on the highway with a horse and buggy is
somewhat dangerous.
   The U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted the First Amendment to
mean that sincerely held religious beliefs may not be infringed upon
by the state unless the limitation is the least restrictive means to
achieve a ``compelling state interest.''
   A ruling in the case is not expected for at least one month.

   The Federal Aviation Administration sent a
report to Congress on Wednesday outlining plans to reduce
air-traffic controller errors at Chicago's O'Hare International
Airport, but Illinois' two senators said it fell short of
expectations.
   The six-page document sent to Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., for relay
to other lawmakers contained few details and set no timetable for
implementating FAA proposals.
   Among them were the hiring of an unspecified number of former
O'Hare controllers to ease a staff shortage, a pay incentive to
increase the size of the tower staff, and the expansion of
controller facilities.
   ``We have a big problem at O'Hare,'' Simon said. ``What we wanted
was an action plan. What we got was a wish list.''
   Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., issued a statement calling the report
``inadequate.''
   ``This doesn't begin to address the problem,'' Dixon said.
   Dixon has proposed the re-hiring of some of the controllers who
were fired in a 1981 strike. He said O'Hare needs 37 more
controllers to bring its total to 72, but the FAA report calls for
the addition of only five.
   Dixon also said the FAA report made no mention of limits on the
number of flights going into and out of O'Hare.
   The Senate passed a resolution earlier this month instructing the
FAA to inform Congress by Oct. 25 of its immediate and long-term
goals to improve operations blamed for a surge of controller errors
at O'Hare, the nation's busiest airport.
   Its controllers have had 30 such mistakes this year, compared
with 12 during all of 1987 and their previous record of 22 in 1986,
the FAA said.
   The report, which was approved Tuesday by Transportation
Secretary James Burnley and presented to Simon a day after the
Senate deadline, promised action to improve operations at O'Hare in
five broad categories: staffing and training, facilities and
equipment, communications, airspace, and safety and efficiency on
the ground.
   To address a manpower shortage, the FAA cited two steps that
officials already have decided to take.
   Five controllers are being relieved of training responsibilities
and returned to regular traffic handling at the facility, and the
agency has begun assigning personnel with experience at O'Hare on a
temporary basis until more fully trained controllers can be added to
the staff.
   It also said it hopes to adopt the pay incentive program and
intends to establish a recruiting program as well as look into the
possibility of ``sectorizing positions of operation'' so controllers
need to be trained at fewer operating stations.
   ``This review, as others, has identified numerous equipment and
physical plant improvements that could be made in order to improve
the efficient operation at Chicago tower,'' the report said. ``Many
of these can be made in the short term.''
   For example, the FAA has leased a television-type weather monitor
for the Chicago tower while the agency waits for acquisition of
similar units throughout the air-traffic control system.
   The agency also cited several steps to make communications
between pilots, controllers, airlines and technicians more efficient
_ such as reassessing the distribution of hand-held two-way radios
and limiting radio conversations.
   The recommendations essentially summarized 80 proposals the
agency had made earlier to improve operations at O'Hare and broke no
new ground, said Simon's press secretary, David Carle.
   ``Not only was Simon disappointed with the lack of a timetable,
but he felt the FAA should have addressed other problems, like
flight delays,'' Carle said. ``He said that demonstrates the agency
still doesn't recognize that the status quo is unacceptable.''

   The Iraqi ambassador to the U.N. said
Wednesday that if Iran-Iraq peace talks break down over the
Shatt-al-Arab waterway, Iraq will reopen a new deep-water port just
west of the Shatt.
   Ambassador Ismat Kittani said the port at Khor Zouber was
productive before war broke out in September 1980 and could be
restored if Iran is unwilling to guarantee free navigation on the
Shatt-al-Arab and agree to its being dredged.
   He spoke with reporters at his home Wednesday night just before
returning to Baghdad for consultations. The peace talks resume in
Geneva on Monday.
   Khor Zouber is reached by turning west just before entering the
Shatt-al-Arab, Kittani said, and entering the Khor Abdallah channel,
which empties into the Persian Gulf.
   The Shatt was Iraq's main outlet to the gulf before the war, but
has been blocked by sunken ships, unexploded ordnance and silt that
has accumulated since the war began in September 1980.
   Asked if Iraq wanted to develop an alternative deep-water port,
Kittani replied, ``We'll have to'' if the Iranians won't agree to
begin the dredging and reopening of the Shatt, known to Iran as the
Arvand River.
   ``We certainly can do without Basra'' if necessary, said Kittani.
Basra, Iraq's major port city on the Shatt, was heavily shelled in
the war.
   The envoy noted that before the war, ``at least 85 percent of
Iran's imports came to Iran through the Shatt, to Khorramshar'' on
the east bank of the passage.
   Kittani said regarding rights to the Shatt: ``Each is on his side
(of the passage). We will decide the sovereignty of running water
later (in the peace talks).''
   ``Whatever agreement is signed on the Shatt, both countries will
be able to use it,'' with specific rights to be worked out, said
Kittani.
   Iran insists the 1975 Algiers Treaty, which defines their border
as running down the middle of the Shatt, must be maintained.
   President Saddam Hussein of Iraq rejected the treaty in 1980.
Iraq distrusts Iran's commitment to a true peace settlement, and
diplomats have said it appears Iraq may want to gain sovereignty
over the entire Shatt to guarantee its freedom of navigation.

   Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt offered
a hitman $1 million to kill Playboy magazine founder Hugh Hefner,
Frank Sinatra, publisher Walter Annenberg and Penthouse publisher
Bob Guccione, authorities said Wednesday.
   The $1 million never was paid, however, and the purported hitman,
Mitchel L. WerBell, died of a heart attack in December 1983 about a
month after he allegedly accepted the check from Flynt, sheriff's
Capt. Robert Grimm said at a news conference.
   Grimm identified targets of the alleged plot as Hefner, Sinatra
and Guccione. He declined to name a fourth person targeted, but
KNBC-TV news reported that person was Annenberg.
   ``Larry Flynt one evening called an individual by the name of
WerBell to his home and allegedly offered him $1 million if he would
arrange for the death of these four individuals,'' Sheriff Sherman
Block told KNBC.
   WerBell called himself an advisor to the Green Berets in Vietnam
and a retired general of the Royal Free Afghan Army, according to
promotional material from his counterterrorism firm, Sionics Inc.,
released by the Sheriff's Department.
   ``He did in fact give WerBell a $1 million check which,
immediately upon leaving, we were told, that Flynt's business
manager stopped payment on that check so it never was negotiated,''
the sheriff of Los Angeles County said in the broadcast interview.
   The station displayed a photocopy of a $1 million check allegedly
signed by Flynt, made out to WerBell.
   Grimm said information about the alleged plot turned up recently
in the investigation the 1983 murder-for-hire slaying of New York
theater producer Roy Radin, whom authorities said was embroiled in a
soured finance deal for the movie ``The Cotton Club.''
   Grimm said sheriff's investigators have not interviewed Flynt and
have not presented a case to the district attorney's office. He
declined to elaborate and said the sheriff spoke about the purported
plot because he was approached by the news media and decided to
answer questions about it.
   In 1983, Flynt claimed to have knowledge of videotapes
purportedly showing Vicki Morgan, mistress of the late Diners Club
founder Alfred Bloomingdales engaged in sexual antics with Reagan
administration officials.
   The tapes were never produced or proven to exist.
   Another time that year, Flynt threatened to parachute over the
Pacific Ocean at the site where Korean Air Lines Flight 007 was shot
down by a Soviet interceptor.
   At the time, Flynt was heavily sedated with powerful drugs to
assuage pain from wounds that left him paralyzed after an
assassination attempt in 1978 during an obscenity trial in Georgia.
   Block told KNBC that Flynt could possibly be prosecuted for
soliciting a murder. However, no charges have been filed.
   Bill Farley, director of communications for Playboy, said the
plot occurred in November 1983 and came to light in the course of an
investigation into another matter.
   Farley said his information came from the Sheriff's Department,
but he did not know what the other matter was.
   Susan Reynolds, publicist for Frank Sinatra, said the entertainer
was en route to Reno, Nev., for performances and she wasn't able to
contact him. She said she would leave a message at the hotel, asking
him to call.
   A telephone call placed to Penthouse magazine headquarters in New
York was answered by a security guard who said no one representing
the magazine was available for comment.
   A telephone call placed to Annenberg's Palm Springs home was
answered by a woman who said he was in residence on the East Coast
and wouldn't be immediately available for comment.
   She declined to disclose her relationship to Annenberg or what
city he was living in. She took a message and said she would forward
it to Annenberg. After hours calls made to Annenberg's Triangle
Publications, in Radnor, Pa., went unanswered.
   Block said he considered the matter serious. ``I've been led to
believe that Larry Flynt has a propensity to try to harm people he
sees as his enemies, whether business arrangements or whatever,''
Block said.
   A receptionist at Flynt's office didn't know where the publisher
and said she was unaware of the report on the alleged murder plot.
   Although the broadcast report suggested a publishing rivalry
between the men's magazine publishers, Farley said the other names
suggested that was not the case and that the motivation is unknown.
   ``Why the authorities chose to release Hugh Hefner's name and not
anybody else's is a mystery to me,'' Farley said.

<TEXT>
   The vice president of Peru questioned the
safety of the state airline on Wednesday and urged that it be
reorganized, a day after 12 people died in the fiery crash of an
Aeroperu jetliner.
   A Swiss priest and four other Europeans were among those killed.
   Fifty-seven people survived, many with serious injuries, when the
twin-jet Fokker-28 crashed immediately after taking off from the
airport in Juliaca, more than 12,000 feet above sea level in the
Andes mountains.
   Aeroperu said six Americans and nine other foreigners were among
44 people with significant injuries. The other survivors received
minor bruises.
   The U.S. Embassy said Aeroperu earlier mistakenly identified one
of the dead as an American. The British Embassy said the man,
Douglas Harris, was a 53-year-old Briton living in the United States.
   Areoperu said a passenger earlier listed as unaccounted for was a
Peruvian, who survived without major injuries.
   The company also issued a communique late Wednesday, responding
to mounting criticism since the crash. ``The plane was in proper
operating condition, fulfilling strictly the maintenance regulations
stipulated by the manufacturer,'' the communique said.
   However, Vice President Luis Alberto Sanchez said in a radio
interview, ``Aeroperu needed and still needs substantial reform. New
planes are needed ... But, above all, they must be functioning in a
constant state of repair.'' The Pilots' Association of Aeroperu had
charged that the airline's fleet of 10 planes was in poor shape
because of a shortage of spare parts and lack of maintenance.
   The union struck briefly two months ago over the issue.
   Aeroperu said the foreigners aboard the Dutch-made craft when it
crashed were mainly tourists returning from a visit to nearby Lake
Titicaca. Flight 771 was bound for Lima, 540 miles to the northwest,
with a stop in Arequipa.
   Survivors and witnesses on the ground said an explosion rocked
the plane seconds after takeoff. The plane crashed by the Cabanillas
River, a mile from the airport.
   Many victims died from burns suffered after the plane split in
three pieces on impact and the tail section burst into flames,
officials said.
   Transportation Minister Camilo Carrillo said the pilot averted a
greater disaster by steering the jet toward a sandy flood plain,
which softened the impact.
   Officials gave no cause for the accident. They said an
investigation was under way.
   Besides Harris, Aeroperu identified the European dead as the Rev.
Kurt Lenz, a Roman Catholic priest from Switzerland who worked near
Juliaca; Herbert and Ingeborg Pfiller, a married couple from France;
and Bruno Baldazari of Italy.
   It listed six Americans, three Spaniards, two Italians, two
French, one Briton and one Brazilian among the injured.
   Prior to Tuesday's crash, the last major air accident here
occurred Dec. 9 when a twin-engine Navy Fokker F-27 crashed off
Lima's Pacific coast, killing 44 people, including nearly the entire
squad of Peru's No. 1 soccer team Alianza Lima.

   An 8-year-old girl allegedly beaten to death
at an Oregon farm while other children watched and counted the blows
was laid to rest Wednesday, with a plea from her uncle to ``learn to
love another better.''
   Dayna Lorea Broussard died Oct. 14 at the home used by Ecclesia
Athletic Association, a group founded by her father, Eldridge
Broussard Jr. purportedly to train ghetto youngsters to be
world-class athletes and entertainers.
   The girl was beaten and whipped by members of the group,
authorities alleged. Four people were charged with manslaughter.
   Broussard was not among the 150 family members and friends who
filled the Angelus Funeral Home, where the little girl lay in an
open pink casket.
   ``Little Dayna is in the arms of Jesus now,'' said the Rev.
Charles Bereal, pastor of Calvary Bible Church of Compton. ``She's
safe. Amen.''
   ``We're the ones who are left behind,'' he said. ``We're the ones
who are still struggling.''
   In his eulogy, Bereal asked mourners to trust in God with the
simplicity of a child. ``Adults have a tendency to be proud,''
Bereal said. ``A child will willingly go, saying, `I trust you. I
humble myself to you.'''
   The girl's uncle, Henry Webb, told mourners: ``This is an
experience that we've never experienced before. Through this
experience may we learn to love one another better and to experience
life more.''
   The girl's cousin, Michael Bereal, who acted as a pallbearer,
said most members of the family were deeply troubled by Broussard's
actions.
   ``It's a cult,'' said Bereal, ``I hope the authorities break all
that stuff up. It's all El Broussard _ he's the whole problem.''
   Meanwhile in Los Angeles, a misdemeanor complaint alleging child
endangerment and inflicting illegal corporal punishment was filed
Wednesday against Alvin Elvis Broussard, the 25-year-old brother of
Eldridge Broussard Jr.
   The complaint stemmed from a police visit to the Watts Christian
Center on Oct. 16, prompted by news reports of Dayna's death in
Oregon, said Mike Qualls, a spokesman for City Attorney James K.
Hahn.
   ``While the officers were at the center, they noticed that a
10-year-old boy had bruises on his head and chest,'' Hahn said in a
prepared statement. ``They questioned him about his injuries and he
told them Alvin Broussard had struck him with a rubber hose and a
closed fist.''
   Alvin Broussard initially was booked for investigation of felony
child endangerment, but the case subsequently was referred to Hahn's
office for misdemeanor prosecution, said Deputy City Attorney Alice
Hand.
   In Oregon, authorities said the children, who were kept in a
sparsely furnished, four-bedroom farmhouse, were subjected to
ritualistic beatings of up to 800 strokes with a paddle or
electrical cord.
   In some cases, including the beating death of Dayna, children
were forced to watch and keep count, authorities said. The beatings
were intended to enhance athletic performance, not to punish
misbehavior, authorities have said.
   The children, mostly from the impoverished Watts section of Los
Angeles, were kept in the farmhouse near Sandy, about 30 miles
southeast of Portland.
   The state of Oregon has taken 53 children into protective custody
from the farm. Two other children involved in the group are in
custody in Los Angeles.
   Eldridge Broussard Jr. has denied that the children were beaten
or abused, saying they were only ``spanked.''
   The four suspects in the girl's death, all of whom have pleaded
innocent to first-degree manslaughter charges, remained in custody
Wednesday after defense lawyers asked that scheduled release
hearings be delayed. A defense lawyer said the attorneys haven't had
enough time to review investigative reports in the case.

   A Mexican drug trafficker convicted in the
torture-murder of a U.S. drug agent was sentenced Wednesday to life
in prison plus 240 years by a judge who said the evidence was
conclusive.
   Rene Verdugo Urquidez, 36, who admitted to running a major
marijuana trafficking organization, arose to protest his innocence
in court before he was sentenced.
   He slumped slightly as U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie
announced the concurrent sentences, which will make Verdugo
ineligible for parole for at least 60 years.
   Earlier, Rafeedie sentenced a co-defendant, Jesus Felix
Gutierrez, to 10 years in prison following his conviction as an
accessory after the fact.
   Felix, 38, was convicted of helping Mexican drug lord Rafael Caro
Quintero escape to Costa Rica following the 1985 torture-murder of
Enrique Camarena, a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent.
   Camarena had been investigating Caro's drug smuggling empire in
Mexico when he was kidnapped outside the U.S. consulate in
Guadalajara on Feb. 7, 1985.
   Camarena's battered body was found, along with the body of his
pilot, in a shallow grave at a remote ranch 65 miles southeast of
Guadalajara on March 5, 1985.
   Verdugo declared through an interpreter: ``You are judging an
innocent person. That's all I have to say.''
   His attorney, Michael Pancer, also argued passionately before
sentencing that the jury verdict was wrong.
   ``This is the most difficult moment I've had in court in 20
years,'' the attorney said. ``I know it's important for counsel to
accept the verdict, but your honor, I can't do that.
   ``The verdict was not correct, because Mr. Verdugo is innocent of
wrongdoing in this case,'' Pancer said.
   The prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jimmy Gurule, told the
judge that the jury was right and he urged the judge to send a
powerful message to drug traffickers by imposing a stiff sentence.
   Verdugo was typical of a band of ``narco-terrorists'' who are
``attacking the foundation and fabric of society,'' Gurule said.
   Rafeedie rejected the prosecutor's request for a 900-year
sentence, and instead imposed four consecutive 60-year terms on four
of the counts and a single life imprisonment sentence on another
charge.
   ``The fact of the matter is the evidence is conclusive and
undisputed,'' Rafeedie said, ``that on the date that the murder and
torture was taking place that (Verdugo) was at that house.''
   He added, ``There is enough here on the part of the jury to find
participation on the part of Mr. Verdugo.''
   Earlier, Rafeedie ordered that Felix serve his 10-year sentence
after his current 15-year term for marijuana trafficking.
   Felix's lawyer, Barry Tarlow, had argued that his client's role
was minor and that he was far less important in the overall scheme
of Camarena's murder than two co-defendants also convicted in the
Camarena case.
   The third defendant, Raul Lopez Alvarez, is to be sentenced
Friday.

<TEXT>
   Swastikas and the words ``No Remorse''
were discovered Wednesday painted on a prominent Holocaust memorial
containing ashes of Jews who died in the Auschwitz concentration
camp.
   The desecration of the monument with anti-Semitic graffiti
stunned members of the Jewish community, who said the words written
on the 11-year-old memorial demonstrated that whoever committed the
vandalism fully understood the significance of the site.
   ``I was absolutely distraught. It was as if the seas of Nazism
were once again flourishing,'' said Arthur Spiegel, executive vice
president of the Jewish Federation of New Haven.
   The vandalism was the first incident of desecration to the
memorial since someone tried to burn down six yew bushes at the site
10 years ago, Spiegel said.
   The memorial is located in a small park situated along a major
city artery. Spiegel summoned police to the site after being alerted
early Wednesday morning of the vandalism.
   Two swastikas were spray-painted on the monument's brass plaques,
and the words ``No Remorse'' and ``White Power'' were written on the
concrete base, Spiegel said.
   The brass monument depicts the barbed wire fences of the Nazi
concentration camps. A statement dedicating the memorial to the six
million Jews who died in the Holocaust is written in English,
Yiddish and Hebrew.
   Ashes recovered from the Nazi concentration camp in Auschwitz,
Poland, were re-interred in the base of the memorial, and local
Holocaust survivors who have ``no other cemetery to go to'' visit it
to say prayers for family members and friends who perished in the
war, Spiegel said.
   Spiegel said the use of the slogan ``No Remorse'' indicated to
him that an adult was responsible for the desecration. ``Youngsters
don't use the word `remorse.' That is not in a child's vocabulary,''
he said.
   City police Major Thomas Muller said an investigation was
continuing, and that police could not yet say whether the act was
the work of a youngster or an adult.
   The swastikas and slogans were all removed, with the only lasting
damage occurring to the brass plates, Spiegel said.
   The memorial, designed by a Christian architect who accepted no
payment for his services, was erected in 1977.
   Plaques recognizing the role of ``righteous gentiles'' who helped
Jews during the war and servicemen who fought the Nazis were added
to the memorial site.
   The monument was the first of its kind in the country built
jointly by a municipality and a Jewish organization, he said.
   About 300 of the estimated 25,000 Jews living in the New Haven
area are Holocaust survivors, according to the Jewish Federation.

   National public employees struck on
Wednesday for the first time in Honduran history, and President Jose
Azcona Huyo ordered soldiers posted in front of government buildings.
   The approximately 60,000 strikers, including teachers, hospital
employees and transportation workers, demand pay increases of about
10 percent. Their average monthly salary now is about $500.
   They also want the government to resume severance payments. In
the past two years, the government has fired about 5,000 employees.
Union officials said the dismissals appear politically motivated and
are continuing.
   Striking hospital workers said they would handle only emergency
cases.
   The government said employees who do not show up at work Thursday
will not be paid. Sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the Labor Ministry probably will declare the strike illegal.
   The strike began at 7 a.m. and kept Azcona Hoyo in an emergency
Cabinet meeting most of the day.
   Obdulio Chevez, president of the Association of Public Employees,
said the strike will continue until the government agrees to salary
and job stability demands.
   For 1{ years, Congress has held up a proposed law that includes
economic and social benefits for government workers, Chevez said.
   He said Carlos Montoya, president of Congress and the Liberal
Party's presidential candidate, refused to meet with strike leaders
Wednesday.
   The impact of the strike was most evident in the capital, but
public employees throughout the country also stayed off the job
Wednesday morning.
   Labor Minister Adalberto Discua said efforts to find an
acceptable solution have failed.

   Guidelines issued today by the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists say women who have had babies
delivered by Caesarean section should be encouraged to have later
children by normal, vaginal birth.
   Dr. Mary Jo O'Sullivan, a member of an ACOG panel that developed
the guidelines, said a pregnant women who has had an earlier child
by Caesarean section ``should be encouraged to attempt labor in her
current pregnancy'' instead of routinely undergoing a second
surgical delivery.
   Dr. O'Sullivan said if the new guidelines are accepted by U.S.
hospitals, they will go a long way toward ending the ``once a
C-section, always a C-section'' tradition that has guided obstetric
practice since 1916.
   The ACOG committee found that women who have had a C-section
procedure, a low transverse incision of the uterus, were successful
in subsequent vaginal delivery attempts in most cases.

   The turnout in the presidential election is
expected to be one of the lowest this century, continuing a trend of
declining voter participation in a nation that prides itself as a
beacon of Western democracy, say political analysts.
   Public interest groups are warning that only 50 percent or less
of the eligible voters will go to the polls on Nov. 8, about the
same as the record low 49 percent turnout in the 1924 presidential
election.
   The declining turnout, down from a record high 79 percent in
1896, puts the United States at the bottom of the voter
participation list in the world's democratic systems.
   Belgium heads the average voter participation list with 95
percent while the United States ranks last with 53 percent and
Ireland second to last at 62 percent, according to figures compiled
by Frances Fox Piven and Richard Cloward in their book, ``Why
Americans Don't Vote.''

   A state lawmaker vowed to seek wages, guns and
even Confederate flags from 11 Klansmen to collect his share of a $1
million award to civil rights marchers pelted with rocks in nearly
all-white Forsyth County.
   A federal jury found the Ku Klux Klansmen and two white
supremacist groups responsible for disrupting the Jan. 17, 1987,
march north of Atlanta, and awarded $948,650 in damages to 49
demonstrators who filed suit. The jury's verdict was unsealed

   ``It is a message to the Ku Klux Klan nationwide that this can
happen to you,'' said state Rep. J.E. ``Billy'' McKinney, one of the
demonstrators.
   McKinney said he and the other plaintiffs ``are determined we
will get every dime that we can get out of the Klan.''

   The staggering new corporate debt burdens
proposed in the wave of multibillion-dollar leveraged buyout bids
could force companies to make big layoffs and reduce employee
benefits to cover debt payments, critics say.
   The impact of these buyouts _ which rely largely on borrowed
funds _ also could multiply if the U.S. economy enters a recession,
and the companies are unable to generate the cash flow or asset
sales needed to raise money for their debt payments, according to
labor economists and consultants.
   In one of the latest developments, the buyout firm Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts & Co. has offered to pay $20.28 billion _ most of
which represents borrowed money rather than equity _ to acquire food
and tobacco giant RJR Nabisco Inc.
   Warnings about the leveraged buyout wave come as many U.S.
companies already are aggressively cutting costs to survive in an
increasingly competitive world economy.

   A fallen whiz kid who made and lost millions
in carpet cleaning admitted at his securities fraud trial he was so
desperate to keep the business afloat he stole his grandmother's
jewelry.
   Barry Minkow, seeking to dispel his image as a corrupt business
prodigy, testified Tuesday that he was a frightened little boy
manipulated by extortionists.
   ``I didn't know what to do,'' said Minkow, who admitted he
perpetrated a multimillion-dollar swindle that defrauded investors
of about $25 million. ``I was in the 11th grade. I had a lot of
trouble sleeping. I knew I was in a lot of trouble.''
   Minkow, now 22, took the stand as the first defense witness and
told jurors how his youthful ambition led him to form the ZZZZ Best
carpet cleaning company at age 16 in his parent's garage.

   Dan Lauria believes that one reason he works
so much as an actor is that few people in the film business look at
old movies.
   He plays the overworked father on ABC's ``The Wonder Years'' and
has had recurring roles on two other series. He was in the movie
``Stakeout'' and played Bernadette Peters' boyfriend in the TV movie
``David.'' This Saturday, he plays the veteran police sergeant in
``Cop Killer,'' the first installment of the remake of the anthology
series ``Police Story'' on ABC.
   ``People don't watch the old movies,'' said Lauria. ``Nobody
knows Richard Conte. I go in for a part and do my Richard Conte or
Van Heflin. Nobody knows I'm stealing. I steal from the best and I
don't feel bad about it.''
   Lauria appears with Ken Olin and Patricia Wettig, the
husband-and-wife stars of ABC's ``thirtysomething,'' in the premiere
episode of ``Police Story.''
   ABC revived ``Police Story'' last summer during the writers'
strike when it appeared the networks would not have new shows ready
for the fall season. The series, created by author Joseph Wambaugh,
ran on NBC from 1973-77. Lauria's role was originally played by
Cameron Mitchell.
   ``I'm the veteran police sergeant,'' said Lauria. ``Kenny Olin is
the young stud cop. Olin's partner is taken hostage during a traffic
stop. They're bank robbers and it turns into a firefight. His
partner is killed and Kenny kills a bank robber and gets a medal.
Even though he did everything by the book, Kenny goes through a
psychological change.
   ``I loved working with Kenny. He didn't walk through it. We
talked over the characters, which is rare for television. This is
more of a drama about what happens to this man than an action
picture.''
   Lauria grew up watching old movies, and still watches them
regularly from his large collection of tapes. His ambition is to
work with James Stewart.
   ``I grew up in Lindenhurst, N.Y., and my aunt lived with us when
I was young,'' he said. ``I was a big jock in school. When I got
home from practice I'd eat dinner and my aunt would send me straight
to bed. Then, she'd wake me in the middle of the night. She'd say,
`James Cagney.' Or `James Stewart,' or `Tyrone Power.' I'd get up
and watch the most wonderful movies.
   ``When the networks decided to revive some old shows during the
writers' strike I don't know why they went back to the 1970s. They
should have gone back to the 1950s and redone those great live
dramas. I can think of a lot of shows that stand up pretty well
today.''
   Lauria began acting at Southern Connecticut University, which he
attended on a football scholarship. As a captain in the Marine
Corps, he served briefly in Vietnam and at Quantico, Va., where he
shared an office with Oliver North. He also received a master's
degree from Yale and a degree in playwriting from the University of
Connecticut.
   ``I'm the adviser on `The Wonder Years' since it takes place in
1968,'' he said. ``The producers, Neal Marlens and Carol Black, were
only 12 at the time. So, if a question comes up, they look at me
like the old guard. The real stars of this show are the scripts.
They are so wonderful.
   ``I didn't want to do the part at first. They offered me more
money. I said it wasn't the money. Then Carol cried. I said, `Wait,
a producer who cries?' The reason I said no was that I figured it
would last for eight years. I didn't want to be locked up that
long.''
   Lauria has a recurring role on ABC's ``Hooperman'' as Barbara
Bosson's husband. Until its cancellation, he played a detective on
CBS' ``Cagney & Lacey.'' He worked in the precinct where Mary Beth
Lacey lived, and was the one who arrested her when she joined a
protest march.

role and Louis Gossett Jr. in another crime drama, ``Gideon

<HEAD>Learning To Sail The Seas At The Great Lakes Maritime Academy</HEAD>

   In a darkened classroom, a slide
projector beams a photograph of a bend in the St. Marys River where
crosscurrents have fooled some of the most experienced Great Lakes
freighter pilots.
   The students studying the narrow river stretch make mental notes
for the day they will steer a hulking 700-foot lake freighter
through the same winding passage.
   For cadets at the Great Lakes Maritime Academy, such training in
current navigational technology is combined with the guidance of
experienced sailors.
   ``It's much better training than you can get on a ship because we
can simulate near-collisions or running aground,'' said Rear Adm.
James F. McNulty, superintendent of the academy, which is part of
Northwestern Michigan College.
   Graduates of the three-year deck officer program can be licensed
to pilot commercial vessels, starting at $18,000 to $20,000 a year.
   Does the reality of life on the high seas match the adventure and
glamor of Great Lakes folklore?
   ``I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who doesn't like getting
dirty or who needs to see a movie every night or who likes to run
out to the store,'' said graduate Candace Peterson, 30, of Two
Harbors, Minn., one of few women working on the U.S. fleet on the
Great Lakes.
   ``There's no glamour in it at all. But it's wonderful going home,
knowing you've made a good wage and have choices of what to do with
your money,'' said Peterson, third assistant engineer on the USX
Corp.'s fleet. She expects to make $30,000 to $40,000 this shipping
season.
   New graduates typically work as relief help for vacationing
sailors or those who take advantage of their 30 days shore leave for
each 90 days worked, McNulty said.
   In his first job after graduating in 1985, John Basile piloted a
tour boat around Escanaba, Mich., for $8 an hour. The following two
years, he worked as a fill-in deck hand, making $20,000 to $25,000
each year.
   ``I've loved the water all my life and wanted to have something
to do with it,'' said Basile, who now sails lake freighters with
Inland Lakes Management of Alpena. ``I wanted to make a lot of money
and I didn't want to spend a lot of time in college.''
   McNulty has been speaking to the Elks, Optimists and Kiwanis
clubs, trying to recruit students from Cleveland, Milwaukee and
throughout Michigan. The task isn't easy.
   ``In the early 1980s, the opportunities for graduates were not
good and the news was widespread,'' he said.
   Great Lakes shipping slumped in the early 1980s due mostly to a
slipping demand for steel. The 1987 season was brisk, and through
August of this year, the most recent figures available, shipments of
iron ore, coal and stone were up 13.5 percent over the same
eight-month period last year, said Glenn Nekvasil, spokesman for the
Lake Carriers Association.
   By 1991, at least 71 pilots and 69 engineers will be needed by
the 14 shipping companies that comprise the Lake Carriers
Association to fill vacancies created by retirement, the
Cleveland-based association says.
   McNulty, an ebullient 58-year-old Irishman who earned the rank of
rear admiral in the U.S. Navy before retiring, became director of
the academy in 1984.
   Enrollment is 57 students this year; its high was 210 in 1981.
   Among the school's benefactors is Canadian balladeer Gordon
Lightfoot, who underwrites a $5,000 annual scholarship. His donation
came after one of the school's cadets died in the sinking of the
Edmund Fitzgerald on Lake Superior in November 1975, the subject of
a hit song by Lightfoot.
   The academy is one of six regional state-run facilities in the
United States. It is considered quasi-military, but except for
requiring cadets to wear khaki-colored pants and shirts and black
shoes, military rules are absent, McNulty said.
   The school offers two programs. One trains cadets to become deck
officers who can eventually pilot the Great Lakes freighters that
primarily haul iron ore, stone and coal. The second program trains
cadets to maintain equipment on the commercial vessels.
   Subjects include naval science, nautical rules, ship construction
and ship stability and ship handling. Both programs lead to an
associate of applied science degree.
   The three-year programs include nine months of training on a
commercial freighter. That's when many students learn whether life
on the seas is for them.
   ``A lot of youngsters decide they want to become sailors after
reading some romantic novel,'' McNulty said. ``It's not all like
that, it can be very dull.''
   Of each 50 students who enroll in the program, McNulty said about
15 drop out.
   ``We've lost a couple good ones to love,'' McNulty said. ``They
get back and their girl says, `If this is the way it's going to be,
get yourself another girl.' To be a sailor's wife, it takes a
special kind of gal.''

   A debate is raging in the financial world these
days over whether home prices might be headed for the same kind of
crash that hit the stock market a year ago.
   Without question, this is a touchy subject. As a group, American
individuals and families have an enormous stake in residential real
estate, much greater than they have ever had in stocks.
   Of course, the two markets and the assets traded in them differ
in many significant ways. Housing fulfills a basic human need, while
stocks are a purely financial proposition.
   Still, no free market is immune to a decline, regardless of what
commodity is traded in it.
   The argument got under way in earnest two months ago, when
Barron's magazine published an article on the ``coming collapse in
home prices,'' citing warnings from analysts at the respected
investment firm of Comstock Partners.
   Since that story appeared there has been something of a rush by
other analysts to rebut it.
   Contrary to the general impression, said Edward Yardeni,
economist at Prudential-Bache Securities, ``the amount of mortgage
debt owed by American households is surprisingly low, especially
relative to the value of their homes.''
   That would seem to minimize the danger of widespread defaults and
forced home sales at sacrifice prices, even in the age of the
adjustable-rate mortgage and the home equity loan.
   But more than debt, the question that troubles some observers is
simply whether home prices are too high. They have been rising
faster than the Consumer Price Index for some 25 years now, and that
presumably cannot continue indefinitely.
   One way to gauge the market is affordability _ the level of home
prices measured against people's ability to make the down payments
and qualify for the mortgages necessary to sustain those prices.
   Gray Cardiff, publisher of the investment advisory letter Sound
Advice, calculates an affordability ratio that compares the median
family income (for a hypothetical household that earns more than
half the population and less than the other half) with the
``qualification income'' necessary to pay the median price for
existing houses.
   For the first half of this year, by Cardiff's reckoning, it took
an income of $27,290 to pay the median national home price of
$88,283.
   Since the actual median family income was $31,341, he says, the
national affordability ratio was a positive 1.15.
   ``When the ratio is above 1.0, houses are affordable and the
market can be expected to remain strong,'' Cardiff declares.
   But the national picture is by no means uniform, he adds.
Affordability ratios vary drastically from region to region and from
one metropolitan area to another.
   Houston, after suffering through the energy recession of the past
several years, has an extremely high affordability ratio of 1.88.
   By contrast, on the East and West coasts, New York, Boston, Los
Angeles and San Francisco all have affordability ratios of less than
1, an indication that ``homes have become dangerously
unaffordable,'' by Cardiff's reasoning.
   To some, Cardiff's analysis may seem a bit simplistic. The
factors that influence home prices from place to place are many and
complex.
   In any case, however, Cardiff makes an important point: The
national real estate market is far from homogeneous.
   True, a nationwide economic slump or worldwide financial crisis
would stand to depress home prices everywhere. But in the experience
of the 1980s, economic trends have been anything but uniform.
   Yardeni concluded, ``We anticipate `rolling recessions' which
will depress different sections of the country at different times.
   ``Home prices could fall in those regions of the country that are
experiencing a recession. But prices should continue to rise in
cities and suburbs that remain prosperous.''

   A few days after RJR Nabisco Inc. disclosed its
top executives were considering offering shareholders $75 a share
for the company, a competing offer of $90 a share came from another
group.
   The first offer, from the insiders, would have totaled $17.6
billion. The second, from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., was for $3
billion more, an amount more than the assets of companies such as
Wang Laboratories or Inland Steel.
   The huge difference brings up many questions, including the
fundamental question of how value is determined. But even this is
not as intriguing as another, which is: What is the responsibility
of corporate officers?
   On an even larger scale, questions are arising about what some
critics see as a no-man's land of regulation that is allowing some
of America's biggest companies to disappear, with unusually huge
benefits to a relative few.
   The insider question, while perhaps not the most important, is
increasingly meaningful in light of the concern about trading
activities of those who have access to inside information, i.e.,
information not available to the public.
   Nobody, for example, is more privy than those who run companies.
Corporate officers know meaningful things not available to the
public, its employees, its shareholders, and competitors for
ownership.
   They know which parts of the company are likely to do best; not
just the divisions, but the plants within the divisions and the
departments, too.
   They know which parts must be sold, which kept, which developed
into new profit centers. They are aware of products not yet on
stream, of personnel to be promoted, of opportunities to be seized.
   Knowing all this, however, does not necessarily put them in a
position to make the best offer to the company's shareholders in a
leveraged buyout. It might, in fact, make it even more difficult to
present the best offer.
   By its nature, that is, a leveraged buyout is among other things
an attempt by buyers to get the maximum leverage, to obtain the
utmost for the least, and even to benefit personally in a way more
profitable than any other available.
   Confronted with a buyout situation, does the corporate officer
look out for the best interests of the company and its shareholders?
Or of himself? Does a management seeking to buy the company work to
boost the company _ or does it wait until the deal is complete, thus
making it a better deal for them?
   Buying out companies has become a prop under the current level of
stock market prices, a rage that accounts for much of the daily
activity. Researchers now study candidates for buyout rather than a
company's sales and earnings. Speculators buy not for earnings
prospects but in anticipation of an offer.
   The main defense of buyouts is that they maximize shareholder
investments and get rid of complacent management, but there are
other sides to that story, too.
   That they immediately raise trading prices can hardly be denied;
but often the company is headed for dismemberment and sale, meaning
the high per share price is a one-time thing. There are no further
increases. Dividends may cease.
   At the same time, many of these shareholders appear to benefit
more than they really do. Long-term investors, for instance, have no
choice but to sell, thus incurring capital gains taxes that
otherwise would have been deferred.
   Most observers also concede that complacent management is at
least put back on its toes. But sometimes a company is vulnerable,
at least temporarily, not because of poor management but because it
is gearing up for the longer term.
   Critics of buyouts say that other aspects of the phenomenon are
not handled any better by regulators.
   Bondholders can be devastated by sharp declines in value. Equity
is often replaced by low-grade debt. Workers may lose jobs.
Communities may lose taxes. The economy might lose some of its
strongest international competitors.
   As the takeover battle rages, the questions mount. Is all this
the reconstruction of corporate America, as sometimes is said, or
might it be its dismemberment?

<HEAD>Campaign Draws to Close as Dukakis Fights to Overcome Sizable Bush
Lead</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The long 1988 campaign, often more negative than enlightening, is
racing to a close with George Bush and Michael Dukakis offering
competing visions of ``a better America,'' and thousands of other
candidates wary of fallout from the presidential race.
   More than 90 million Americans will go to the polls on Nov. 8 to
select a successor to Ronald Reagan, choose one-third of the Senate
and the entire House.
   Twelve states will elect governors. Thousands of other races for
state and local offices as well as scores of initiatives will be on
ballots throughout the country.
   For the Democrats, the prospects were for continued sway over
Congress _ their Senate majority only a longshot risk, their House
control secure. Democrats also were optimistic about adding up to
four governors to their ranks.
   But in Election Day's biggest contest, Dukakis was an underdog in
his bid to recapture the White House for the Democrats after two
Ronald Reagan landslides.
   Republican Bush, who found a political as well as moral virtue in
loyalty to his chief, was bidding to become the first sitting vice
president since Martin Van Buren in 1836 to win election to the
presidency.
   While polls gave Bush the edge going into the final week, they
also profiled an electorate unhappy with the choice and the negative
tone of the campaign.
   ``I think there's a kind of reluctance for people to commit
themselves to one of two people, neither of whom they like,'' said
I.A. Lewis, chief of polling for the Los Angeles Times.
   ``Neither of these guys seems to attract the kind of commitment
that some other presidential candidates have had,'' said Larry
Hugick, of the Gallup Organization.
   Those assessments suggested to Dukakis strategists an opportunity
for a last-minute shift in sentiment. The Massachusetts governor was
closing out his campaign with a strong populist message combined
with counterattacks against Bush commercials portraying him as soft
on crime and defense.
   Dukakis portrayed Bush as the candidate of the rich who would
benefit from his own proposal for a cut in capital gains taxes and
said the Republican nominee was ``running a campaign based on
distortions and distractions _ and outright lies. Why? Because he
can't win an election where the real issues are discussed.''
   Bush countered: ``There are signs showing in the opposition camp
of desperation _ using ads that accuse us of lies.''
   The competing candidates crossed paths regularly in the big
states crucial to their hopes of gaining the 270 electoral votes
needed for election. Voters in California, New York, Illinois, Ohio,
Michigan, and Pennsylvania had the best chance of seeing one or both
of the candidates in person.
   For most Americans, the best view was 30-second glimpses on their
television sets.
   Both candidates, who began their fall campaigns with $46.1
million in federal funds, were expected to buy 30 minutes of network
time for election-eve appeals to voters.
   Watching the presidential campaign with uncommon interest were
other candidates, particularly Democrats with vivid memories of the
1980 Reagan landslide in which Republicans picked up 12 Senate seats
to gain control of the body for the first time in a quarter century.
   Democrats regained a Senate majority in 1986 and entered the
current campaign with a 54-46 edge.
   Of the 33 Senate seats contested this year, 18 are held by
Democrats and 15 by Republicans. Six incumbents _ three in each
party _ did not run for re-election.
   Democrat Charles Robb appeared certain to pick up the open
Republican seat in Virginia, where he is a prohibitive favorite over
Republican Maurice Dawkins.
   The race for another GOP open seat in Washington was considered a
tossup between former Republican Sen. Slade Gorton and Democratic
Rep. Mike Lowry.
   Republicans were optimistic about their chances to win open
Democratic seats in Mississippi and Florida.
   Two Republican incumbents were on the highly endangered list _
Chic Hecht of Nevada and David Karnes of Nebraska.
   Among Democrats, the incumbents with the strongest challenges
were Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey and Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio.
   ``With good breaks, a strong top-of-the-ticket effort which we're
getting ... and with general good luck, we could do it,'' said
Republican Senate campaign committee spokesman Tom Mason when asked
whether the GOP can win the seats they need _ five if there is a
Democratic vice president, four if there is a Republican, to claim
control of the Senate.
   In the House, strategists in both parties were predicting minimal
shifts from the current lineup of 255 Democrats and 177 Republicans.
Three seats are vacant.
   No one was predicting a shift of more than five seats for either
party.
   In races for governor, the Democrats appeared to have a good
chance to enlarge their current 27-23 edge nationwide.
   The most endangered incumbents were Republicans Edward DiPrete of
Rhode Island, Norman Bangerter of Utah, and Arch Moore of West
Virginia. In addition, Democrat Evan Bayh was favored in the race to
succeed Republican Gov. Robert D. Orr of Indiana, who was ineligible
for another term.
   While candidates often hoped for a boost from presidential race
coattails, that was usually an elusive advantage.
   The 1980 Reagan landslide was credited with helping many
Republican candidates, but when he carried 49 states in 1984, his
party lost two Senate seats.

<TEXT>
   For Bush and Dukakis, the 1988 campaign was a political roller
coaster.
   The vice president started out facing demands that he separate
himself from Reagan and establish his own identity.
   Economic hard times in the Midwest and the Iran-Contra scandal
were considered formidable obstacles in Bush's path to the White
House.
   The first major test in the fight for the Republican presidential
nomination _ the Iowa precinct caucuses _ bore that out when Bush
finished an embarrassing third behind Senate GOP leader Bob Dole and
television evangelist Pat Robertson.
   But a funny thing happened on the way to Bush's political
funeral. He bounced back to win the New Hampshire primary. After
suffering two more Midwest defeats in South Dakota and Minnesota,
Bush effectively closed out the GOP race on Super Tuesday when he
won all 16 primaries, most of them in the South.
   Dukakis had a longer road. He finished a respectable third in
Iowa and then won New Hampshire and established his front-runner
status on Super Tuesday. But poor showings in Illinois and Michigan
kept the race open.
   In the spring, Dukakis found his stride and reeled off a series
of primary victories that narrowed the field to himself and Jesse
Jackson. Week after week, Dukakis beat Jackson and also saw national
polls giving him a strong lead over Bush.
   By the end of the Democratic National Convention in July, polls
said Dukakis was favored over Bush by a margin of up to 17 points.
   His choice of Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as a running mate was
widely applauded and was regarded as a direct challenge to Bush in
his adopted home state _ the third biggest electoral prize.
   A month later it was Bush's turn. In contrast to Dukakis' choice
of Bentsen, the Bush selection of Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana was
widely criticized.
   The rival candidates used almost identical words to state their
overall goal.
   ``I seek the presidency to build a better America _ it's that
simple,'' said Bush.
   ``I want to be president not because it's the next rung on the
ladder but because it's the way to act on my values and build the
best America,'' said Dukakis.
   But the campaign rhetoric didn't remain that lofty.
   The Democratic nominee was strangely silent during the summer
while the Bush campaign unleashed a strong campaign focusing on
Dukakis' veto of legislation requiring recitation of the pledge of
allegiance, his state's prison furlough program, and pollution in
Boston Harbor.
   Not until the final weeks of the campaign, when polls had shifted
from the impressive Dukakis lead to a steady margin for Bush, did
the Democratic nominee start striking back.
   Not only did Dukakis finally respond to the Bush attacks, but he
also began sounding a new and sharper populist message.
   ``George Bush wants to help the people who already have it
made,'' he told large, enthusiastic crowds. ``I want to help every
American family make it.''
   Bush was closing out his campaign by staying with the pattern
that had worked so well to date _ days that usually began with an
issues speech and by afternoon shifted to standard stump rhetoric
including the attacks on Dukakis as soft on crime and defense and as
an unrepentant liberal.

<HEAD>Elections Expected to Result in Few Changes In House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Richard H. Stallings sat nervously on the
House floor as the seemingly interminable 100th Congress lurched
toward adjournment more than 2,000 miles from his Idaho
congressional district.
   Stallings, a two-term Democrat, is one of about 40
representatives who face tough re-election fights, and the
late-night House sessions forced him to cancel a series of campaign
appearances. ``Nothing replaces the individual contact with the
constituents,'' he said.
   Activists from both parties expect that when the smoke clears,
many of those struggling incumbents _ about evenly divided between
both parties _ will be victorious. And if history repeats itself,
nearly all of the 408 members of the House seeking re-election will
be there when the 101st Congress convenes in January.
   In 1986, 385 of the 393 House incumbents seeking re-election _ 98
percent _ were victorious. Of the winners, nearly nine out of every
10 captured at least 60 percent of the major party vote, considered
a landslide margin.
   ``Accountability to voters may be a vestigal memory,'' says
Michael Waldman, legislative director of Congress Watch, a frequent
critic of congressional practices. ``Members fear popular
discontent, but they really needn't be because it rarely results in
their defeat.''
   Presidential elections can affect congressional races, but House
incumbents from the party that loses the White House rarely suffer
massive losses. When President Reagan swamped Walter Mondale by
taking 49 states in 1984, Republicans picked up only 14 seats in the
House. The Republicans gained 34 House seats on Reagan's coattails
in 1980, yet Jimmy Carter brought in only one additional House
Democrat in 1976.
   Even with Republican presidential nominee George Bush showing a
steady lead over Democratic rival Michael Dukakis in the polls, no
one expects the Democrats' 255-177 advantage in the House _ there
are three vacancies _ to be seriously diminished.
   Spokeswoman Peggy Connolly of the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee says the overall change in the parties' numbers
in the chamber will probably be two to five seats in either
direction. Steven Lotterer, National Republican Congressional
Committee spokesman, said he expects the GOP to gain some seats, but
adds, ``No one's looking to take over the House.''
   A large reason for this is that incumbents have several built-in
advantages. Their districts, drawn up by their home-state
legislatures, are often shaped to include as many friendly voters as
possible.
   They usually have a much easier job than their opponents do of
raising campaign money. For the 1986 elections, candidates in the
435 House races spent $211 million, with incumbents outspending
challengers by almost 3-to-1.
   In addition, incumbents have staffs, district offices, mailing
privileges, telephones, and other perks that they can turn to their
political advantage.
   They also get to introduce legislation that helps the folks back
home. In the final days of the 100th Congress, Stallings got the
House to pass legislation designating a new national reserve and a
national monument in southern Idaho.
   ``While my opponent is issuing press releases, I'm back here
legislating,'' he said of his rival, Republican Dane Watkins.
   Stallings, of course, was not the only House member last week
eagerly awaiting the chance to return to his district for
campaigning. Some other incumbents who face stiff challenges are:
   _Seven-term veteran Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino, R-Calif., whose
challenger _ state Sen. Gary K. Hart _ atypically expects to spend
the same $1 million the incumbent has budgeted.
   _Rep. Jim Bates, D-Calif., whose GOP opponent, attorney Rob
Butterfield, received a boost from reports that Bates has sexually
harassed female staff aides.
   _Rep. Pat Swindall, R-Ga., who was running a tight race against
Democrat Ben Jones even before Swindall's indictment on charges of
lying to a grand jury investigating money laundering.
   _Rep. John Hiler, R-Ind., who faces a rematch with Democrat Tom
Ward, whom he defeated by 47 votes in 1986's closest congressional
contest.
   _Rep. Clyde Holloway, R-La., who like two years ago is challenged
by Democrat Faye Williams. The economically blighted district is 85
percent Democratic and 35 percent black, but Holloway, a white,
defeated Williams, who is black, by 51 percent to 49 percent last
time.
   _Rep. Bill Emerson, R-Mo., a four-term member who underwent
treatment for alcoholism. His district is one of the poorest in the
country. He faces Democrat Wayne Cryts, whom he narrowly defeated in
1986.
   _A slew of North Carolina incumbents, including Democratic Rep.
David Price, who is challenged by Republican Tom Fetzer; Democratic
Rep. Stephen Neal, who faces Republican Lyons Gray; GOP Rep. Howard
Coble, who won by 79 votes in 1986 and now faces Democrat Tom
Gilmore.
   _Rep. Peter Kostmayer, D-Pa., who has already had his five-term
House career interrupted by a defeat and faces GOP former state Sen.
Ed Howard.
   _Rep. Liz Patterson, D-S.C., a well-liked first-term member who
faces Republican Knox White, a 34-year-old Greenville city
councilman who is trying to paint the congresswoman as a liberal.
   _Rep. Mac Sweeney, R-Texas, a two-term lawmaker who is the first
Republican to represent his district since Reconstruction, facing
Democratic lawyer Greg Laughlin, his 1986 opponent.

<HEAD>Ballot Issues Focus on Gun Control, Insurance Rates, Taxes,
Abortion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   From gun control in Maryland, to a smoking ban in Oregon and tax
cuts in South Dakota, Utah and Colorado, 234 ballot issues will be
decided by voters in 41 states on Election Day.
   California, birthplace a decade ago of a voter-driven tax revolt
that quickly spread to many other states, has two of the nation's
most closely watched contests.
   Californians will choose among five separate ballot measures
reducing automobile insurance premiums. Insurers, fearing a
nationwide ``insurance revolt,'' are spending more than $40 million
in an attempt to defeat the proposals.
   ``The fear is that some of the worst parts of the initiatives
would eventually find their way into the thinking of insurance
regulators across the country, even in states which don't allow
voter initiatives,'' said Herbert Goodfriend, an insurance industry
analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities.
   Also controversial is California Proposition 102, which would
eliminate the statewide anonymous AIDS testing program, allow
insurers and employers to screen prospective clients and workers,
and require health officials to do everything ``reasonably
necessary'' to halt the epidemic, including tracing the contacts of
anyone exposed to the AIDS virus.
   The chief sponsor is Paul Gann, the tax crusader who helped
spearhead property tax-slashing Proposition 13 a decade ago, and who
is now suffering from acquired immune deficiency syndrome because of
a tainted blood transfusion.
   Among other ballot contests:
   _Maryland voters will decide whether to keep a law passed this
spring designed to ban cheap handguns known as Saturday Night
Specials. The National Rifle Association has pumped $3 million into
the repeal effort.
   _Oregonians will vote on whether to toughen the Oregon Indoor
Clean Air Act, which was passed in 1981 and bans smoking in most
public buildings. The new proposal would wipe out designated smoking
areas and impose an outright ban on smoking in virtually all indoor
work areas and enclosed public places.
   Californians, meanwhile, will consider a proposal to raise
cigarette taxes by 25 cents a pack, using proceeds to promote health.
   _In New York, Gov. Mario Cuomo is pushing a $3 billion
transportation bond issue, the biggest borrowing in state history,
to fix roads and bridges. Opponents challenge the wisdom of such a
huge borrowing for that purpose.
   _South Dakota, Utah and Colorado voters will decide measures that
would reduce various taxes.
   Dakota Proposition II would roll back property taxes on
agricultural property to 1 percent of 1984 values, and 2.5 percent
on non-agricultural property in stages by 1991. It would limit
increases in property valuations to 2 percent a year. Local
governments could impose special taxes if two-thirds of the voters
approve.
   Colorado's so-called Taxpayers Bill of Rights Amendment would
require voters to decide all future tax increases except in
emergencies, cut the income tax by about 10 percent, and limit
residential property taxes to 1 percent of market value.
   Utah voters face three tax initiatives that together would reduce
state and local revenues by $329 million. One would limit property
taxes, a second would roll back 1987 tax increases on income, sales,
gasoline and cigarettes, and a third would give tax credits for
private education.
   _In Michigan, pro- and anti-abortion forces are waging
multi-million dollar campaigns over a ballot measure that would
outlaw state-funded abortions for the poor.
   Arkansas voters will decide whether to enshrine its existing
no-abortion spending policy in the state constitution, while
Coloradans will get the chance to repeal a similar constitutional
provision.
   _Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky and Minnesota have lottery questions on
the Nov. 8 ballot, and polls indicate support for those issues.
   South Dakotans will decide whether to clear the way for legalized
gambling in the Black Hills town of Deadwood where Wild Bill Hickok
was gunned down while playing poker 112 years ago. Town officials
want to bring back gambling to help them raise money to preserve
historic buildings.
   _Under a rallying cry of personal freedom, Montana voters will
consider whether to repeal its year-old seat belt law. Massachusetts
and Nebraska voters have previously done so.
   _Utilities are waging a $5 million campaign in Massachusetts to
defeat a measure that could lead to the nation's first
voter-mandated closure of a nuclear power plant.
   Among local ballot contests, Boston residents will decide whether
to permit predominantly black neighborhoods to become a separate new
city named Mandela after the South African black nationalist Nelson
Mandela.
   And the college enclaves of Cambridge, Mass., and Berkeley,
Calif., have similar referendums demanding that Israel ``end its
violations of Palestinian human rights and its occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza.''
   Commented Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz: ``Only
Cambridge and Berkeley would have the chutzpah to think that they
can determine national and international policy by a local ballot on
as complicated an issue.''

   Bush says he would continue the Reagan foreign policy of ``peace
through strength,'' and press forward on strategic-arms-reduction
talks with the Soviets. He would favor total international ban on
chemical weapons and U.S.-Soviet-Chinese effort to stop the spread
of ballistic missiles. Bush supports military aid to the Contra
rebels in Nicaragua.
   Dukakis supports the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty
with the Soviets and proposed strategic arms cuts. He favors wider

   Bush has campaigned as an environmentalist, while Dukakis has
campaigned against the environmental record of the Reagan-Bush
administration.
   Bush supports recently passed law banning ocean dumping of wastes
by the end of 1991; would set a goal of ``no net loss of wetlands'';
delay offshore oil drilling in sensitive areas; support new,
unspecified limits on emissions causing acid rain; support nuclear
power.
   Dukakis vows to beef up the Environmental Protection Agency and
``make the polluters pay.'' He says he will press for stricter
standards for air and water quality; ban offshore drilling in
sensitive areas; halt below-cost timber sales in national forests;
oppose building nuclear power plants until a safer generation of
reactors is designed and safe ways are found to dispose of waste.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DRUGS, CRIME</HEAD>

   Bush favors the death penalty for cop-killers and drug-related
killers, as well as treason and espionage. Dukakis opposes capital
punishment regardless of the crime.
   Dukakis favors tighter controls on guns, including mandatory,
nationwide waiting period for gun purchases. Bush opposes tighter
gun controls.
   Dukakis advocates cutoff of aid to countries that fail to
cooperate in fight against drugs; use of U.S. armed forces ``under
appropriate circumstances'' to help foreign countries destroy drug
crops and labs; hiring 600 more Drug Enforcement Administration
agents.
   Bush says he will make ``the war on drugs a top priority,'' and
says it must be attacked ``not only by stopping the supply, but also
by stopping the demand.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>EDUCATION</HEAD>

   Both favor more spending on Head Start, the pre-school program
for disadvantaged youngsters.
   Dukakis has proposed a college loan program that would allow
students to repay loans through payroll deductions during their
working years.
   Dukakis has proposed a $250 million National Teaching Excellence
Fund, including scholarships and loan forgiveness for prospective
teachers; favors a $45 million effort to bring retired scientists
and engineers into classrooms as teachers or aides; opposes
organized prayer in public schools.
   Congress has just voted to allow families to earn interest
tax-free on U.S. savings bonds for college tuition. Bush proposed
such a move last year. He wants to award unfettered grants of up to
$100,000 to ``Merit Schools'' that succeed in spurring achievement
of disadvantaged students; would seek $50 million in matching grants
for magnet schools; would quadruple to $50 million a new federal
fund to spur school innovations; supports organized, but voluntary,
prayer in public schools.

   Dukakis would allow people to use up to $10,000 from IRAs or
other pension funds towards the down payment on a house; favors
smaller down payments for FHA mortgages, and new efforts to build
low- and moderate-income rental housing.
   Bush says ``decent, affordable housing'' for all families will be
a top goal _ attainable, he says, by maintaining ``the policies that
have brought us low inflation, low interest rates and strong job
creation.'' He promises to keep providing housing assitance to
low-income families, and supports experiments with turning ownership
and control of public housing over to tenants.

<HEAD>Democratic Control Seems Safe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republicans looking for gauges of how they will
fare in the nation's 33 Senate races on Election Day can take little
hope from the two most closely contested battles: Florida and
Washington state.
   Washington and Florida have open seats that Republicans hope to
claim in their uphill battle for retaking control of the Senate,
which they won in 1980 and lost six years later. In both, Democrats
are showing surprising last-minute strength.
   In Washington, where polls show a dead heat, Republican former
Sen. Slade Gorton is airing testimonial ads that seek to plant
doubts about the ideology of liberal Rep. Mike Lowry. ``Mike Lowry
scares the hell out of me,'' says one voter in the ad.
   But Lowry is running strongly with appeals to environmental and
social issues and criticisms of Gorton's record.
   Republican Rep. Connie Mack is taking a similar tack in Florida.
He is trying to link his opponent, Rep. Buddy MacKay, to Democratic
presidential candidate Michael Dukakis in a TV spot that claims both
are against such weapons systems as the B-1 bomber, the MX missile
and President Reagan's ``Star Wars'' defense idea.
   ``Hey, Buddy and Mike _ you're liberal,'' it concludes. But polls
show the two candidates dead even, despite Vice President George
Bush's 20-point advantage over Dukakis in the state.
   Democrats now enjoy a 54-46 advantage in the Senate. Republicans'
longshot hopes to shift five seats depend on a combination of money
and a good Bush showing in key states. In some areas, the favorite
tactic is to link the Democrat to Dukakis.
   But as it has throughout this election year, the scorecard still
seems to be leaning the Democrats' way.
   Of 15 Democrats seeking re-election, all are considered at least
safe; some hold double-digit leads. Of the dozen GOP incumbents, two
_ Nevada Sen. Chic Hecht and appointed Nebraska Sen. David Karnes _
are trailing popular Democratic challengers.
   In six open seats _ where no incumbent is on the ballot _ the GOP
holds a decided advantage in Vermont and Mississippi, the Democrats
in Virginia and Wisconsin, and two, Florida and Washington, are up
for grabs.
   Republicans have conceded all along that they would need every
lucky break to retake the Senate, including a strong coattail effect
from Bush. While the presidential contest seemed to be giving
marginal boosts to Republican hopefuls in a few states, it appears
far short of the kind of sweep that gave the GOP Senate control in
1980, when a 12-seat shift accompanied Reagan's landslide White
House win.
   ``It's not like 1980, when there was a need among voters to voice
change,'' said Tom Mason, communications director for the Republican
National Senatorial Committee.
   Robert A. Chlopak, executive director of the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee, agreed: ``1980 was a repudiation of
high interest rates. You don't have that dynamic'' this year.
   To the extent there are themes running throughout the Senate
races, they seem to be items chosen from the idea grab-bag to suit
each state: the environment, Social Security, education, crime and
drugs, and ``family issues'' such as day care are favorites.
Democrats have sought to claim the issues as their own, but
Republicans have made use of them as well.
   Seen less frequently are the ideological labeling campaigns such
as the GOP is waging in Florida and Washington, and vague ``for the
future'' or ``for the state'' appeals.
   Here is a rundown on some of the pivotal contests:
   WASHINGTON _ In addition to each other, Lowry and Gorton are
battling their own negative images. The formerly bearded and
often-rumpled Lowry has adopted a clean-cut, neatly pressed persona
and toned down his rhetoric to appease voters wary of his
liberalism. Gorton has done televised ``mea culpas'' for the cold
and haughty reputation that contributed to his 1986 defeat.
   FLORIDA _ MacKay's surprising strength may stem partly from his
come-from-behind victory in a Democratic primary runoff Oct. 4. That
kept his name before the voters, and the party appears united behind
him. Mack, who has held poll leads throughout the election season
against a changing array of Democratic opponents, has been
criticized for running an outmoded 1980-style campaign based on
Reaganesque ``less government'' themes. If presidential coattails
have an effect this year, they will show up here.
   CONNECTICUT _ Incumbent Republican Lowell Weicker always has a
tight contest. A recent University of Connecticut poll showed him
even with state Attorney General Joe Lieberman, who is running as a
nuts-and-bolts politician and accusing Weicker of being preoccupied
with grand consititutional issues and forgetting his state's
parochial interests. Weicker, a skillful politician, is not to be
counted out.
   NEW JERSEY _ Some of the nastiest television ads of the year
appear to be eroding the margin of freshman incumbent Frank
Lautenberg. His GOP opponent, Pete Dawkins, found that his own
impressive resume _ Rhodes scholar, Heisman trophy winner, Army
general _ didn't automatically translate into political capital. But
Republicans now claim public resentment of Lautenberg's own negative
advertising has put Dawkins within striking distance.
   NEVADA _ Hecht, the incumbent, criticized as inarticulate and
ineffective, has always been the underdog against popular Democratic
Gov. Richard Bryan. But recent developments have tightened the
spread to single digits. Dukakis surprised Bryan forces by
announcing support for Nevada as the site of a high-level nuclear
waste repository, known locally as the ``screw Nevada'' plan. Hecht
is busily linking the two governors, while Bryan is scrambling to
establish independence from Dukakis on the issue.
   WISCONSIN _ GOP nominee Susan Engeleiter has used televised
debates to chip away at the lead of millionaire Democrat Herb Kohl,
a political novice. Kohl has sought to turn his wealth and
self-financed campaign into a selling point, calling himself
``nobody's senator but yours'' and reaching for the independent
mantle of retiring Sen. William Proxmire. Time is on Kohl's side.
   MISSISSIPPI _ Republican Rep. Trent Lott holds a small and
shrinking lead over Democratic Rep. Wayne Dowdy, who is appealing to
the state's Democratic tradition and supporters of retiring veteran
Sen. John Stennis. Lott holds a 4-1 financial advantage going into
the home stretch, which, with Bush's popularity, could make the
difference.

<HEAD>Democrats Lead in Rhode Island, Indiana, Utah and West Virginia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE BROWN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Democrats are given a good chance of retaking the governor's
mansion in Rhode Island, Indiana, Utah and West Virginia as 12
states fill their top job in contests that have grown closer and
nastier with the approach of Election Day.
   Allegations of racism shadow Indiana's campaign; in Rhode Island,
the hiring of a reputed mobster's ex-wife for a state job has become
an issue, and the race in North Carolina has used television with
notably creative malice.
   Democrats hold 27 of the 50 governorships. Nine incumbents _ six
Republicans and three Democrats _ will be on the ballot. Republican
Robert Orr of Indiana is barred by law from a third term; Montana
Democrat Ted Schwinden and New Hampshire Republican John Sununu are
retiring.
   If Massachussetts' Michael Dukakis is elected president, Lt. Gov.
Evelyn Murphy, also a Democrat, will serve out his term, which
expires in 1990. In Nevada, Lt. Gov. Bob Miller will complete the
two years remaining in fellow Democrat Dick Bryan's term if Bryan is
elected to the Senate.
   Other states electing governors are: Delaware, Missouri, North
Dakota, Vermont and Washington.
   In Rhode Island, Republican Gov. Edward D. DiPrete faces Democrat
Bruce G. Sundlun in a battle largely over ethics. A poll last week
for WPRO radio and WLNE-TV poll had Sundlun leading 44 percent to 35
percent. The margin of error was 5 points.
   The poll came after the former wife of a reputed mobster was
given a job at the Governor's Justice Commission and fired in an
uproar two days later.
   Sundlun, a communications executive who lost to DiPrete by a
landslide in 1986, also has capitalized on news stories about
DiPrete family land deals, an unfinished bridge, and state contracts
awarded to DiPrete campaign contributors.
   DiPrete, in turn, has accused Sundlun of business misconduct and
mismanagement.
   Republican Gov. Arch Moore's bid for an unprecedented fourth term
in economically depressed West Virginia appears headed for defeat at
the hands of an insurance executive and political novice who spent a
record $2.1 million on the primary alone. Unemployment is high and
the government had to borrow $80 million to keep going this year.
Democrat Gaston Caperton held a double-digit lead in recent polls.
   In Indiana, Republican Lt. Gov. John M. Mutz is turning up the
heat in an underdog race against the 32-year-old son of former Sen.
Birch E. Bayh, a contest being watched for the coattail effect of
the Bush-Quayle ticket in Sen. Dan Quayle's home state.
   Evan Bayh, Indiana secretary of state, leads by a much as 13
points in the most recent polls and stands to become the first
Democrat elected governor of Indiana since 1964.
   Mutz has charged that a Bayh TV commercial ``appeals to the
darker side of the human personality'' by evoking racist sentiments
against the Japanese. The ad contends many of the best jobs at a
state-subsidized Subaru-Isuzu auto plant will go to workers of
Japanese ancestry.
   An indignant Bayh responded, ``I would never do anything to
appeal to anyone's racial bigotry.''
   In Utah, Republican Norm Bangerter's bid for a second term is in
deep trouble against Democrat Ted Wilson, former mayor of Salt Lake
City. Wilson leads by as much as 12 points, down from 20 last month,
and independent Merrill Cook has robbed Bangerter of support from
conservative Republicans who blame him for the biggest tax increase
in Utah history.
   In North Carolina, Republican Gov. Jim Martin leads Lt. Gov. Bob
Jordan, a Democrat, in a campaign that has made for good TV.
   Jordan has lampooned Martin's budget-writing process with a
commercial starring chimpanzees in business suits. Martin has run an
ad with footage of Jordan telling black newspaper editors he agrees
with them on some issues but won't discuss them publicly for fear of
alienating ``rednecks.''
   DELAWARE _ Republican Michael Castle has only token opposition in
his bid for a second term against Democrat Jacob Kreshtool.
   MISSOURI _ Republican Gov. John Ashcroft is strongly favored
against Democratic state Rep. Betty Hearnes, wife of a former
governor.
   MONTANA _ A comeback attempt by former Gov. Thomas Judge, a
Democrat, against Republican state Sen. Stan Stephens, is seen as a
toss-up.
   NORTH DAKOTA _ Democratic Gov. George Sinner holds a commanding
lead over Republican Leon Mallberg, a businessman making his first
run for statewide office.
   NEW HAMPSHIRE _ Republican Judd Gregg, a congressman and son of a
former New Hampshire governor, is heavily favored over Paul
McEachern, a fierce opponent of the Seabrook nuclear plant who ran
two years ago.
   VERMONT _ Madeleine Kunin, Vermont's first famale governor, has a
robust economy heavily in her favor against state House GOP leader
Michael Bernhardt.
   WASHINGTON _ Democrat Booth Gardner rolls toward re-election
against state Rep. Bob Williams, who comes out of the evangelical
wing of the Republican Party.

third quarter profit gains, while profits at Texaco Inc. and
Phillips Petroleum Co. more than doubled in the latest period.
   Meanwhile, Shell Oil Co., Sun Co. and Amerada Hess Corp. each
reported sharp declines Tuesday in their net earnings due partly to
declining crude oil prices.
   The larger oil companies said earnings were both hurt and helped
by falling crude prices. Lower costs for the raw product contributed

   The Commerce Department says orders for
``big-ticket'' durable goods plunged an unexpected 4.1 percent in
September.
   Total orders fell $5.0 billion to a seasonally adjusted $117.7
billion last month, pulled down by dramatic declines in the volatile
defense and transportation sectors.
   But economists said Tuesday's report does not necessary mean that
the red-hot manufacturing boom is ending.

   Sales of existing homes fell 2.2 percent in

   The National Association of Realtors said Tuesday sales of
existing homes declined to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.63
million units last month, following a 2.2 percent increase in August.
   But last month's level was still higher than most economists

   Calm and caution have returned to the energy
futures market as traders await further developments from OPEC.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the December contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, picked up 9 cents
to settle at $13.26 a barrel on Tuesday. Other contract months
declined slightly.
   On Monday, the December contract had plunged $1.20 a barrel amid
speculation that OPEC would continue flooding world markets with
crude after failing to reach an accord on limiting rampant
overproduction by its members.
   Trading was light Tuesday and prices moved in a narrow range
``while people figure out what to do,'' said Greg Dreis, a trader
with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has several
more meetings scheduled for next month, and until then, traders are
expected buy or sell in response to any news that indicates whether
the cartel can rein in its output.
   While traders were hesitant in buying crude Tuesday, they
purchased wholesale unleaded gasoline futures enthusiastically. The
November contract for gasoline rose 1.98 cents on the mercantile
exchange to close at 51.94 cents a gallon.
   Demand for gasoline has run high while supplies are low, Dreis
said.
   Home heating oil, which is more plentiful, was mixed. The
November contract for heating oil rose 0.46 cent to close at 40.36
cents a gallon, but subsequent contract months declined.

<HEAD>Minorco Drops Hostile Bid For Consolidated Gold Fields</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Minorco SA's decision to drop its proposed $4.73
billion hostile takeover of Consolidated Gold Fields PLC does not
necessarily mean the South African partnership is halting its
pursuit of Gold Fields, analysts say.
   Minorco dropped its bid Tuesday after the government's Monopolies
and Mergers Commission said it would investigate the deal's impact
on the market for strategic metals, effectively blocking the deal
from proceeding for up to three months.
   The offer _ the biggest takeover bid ever for a British company _
had been conditioned on it not being referred to the commission.
   Although some analysts said Minorco might sell its 29.6 percent
stake in Gold Fields, others said Minorco likely would wait to see
the outcome of the investigation, and proceed with a new bid if the
commission rules in its favor.
   The developments followed a U.S. district judge's decision in New
York on Monday to issue a temporary injunction against the offer on
antitrust grounds. Gold Fields had contended that a takeover by
Minorco would give that company control of 35 percent of the Western
world's gold supplies, compared with its present 20 percent share.
   Gold Fields owns a 49.3 percent stake in New York-based Newmont
Mining Corp., plus minority stakes in Australian and South African
mining companies. Minorco has said it would sell Gold Fields'
Newmont and South African holdings if its bid succeeded.
   Minorco's offer was for 19 pounds ($33.25) in cash and one
Minorco share for every two Gold Fields shares it didn't already
own. At Tuesday's closing level for Minorco shares of 658 pence
($11.52), the offer valued each Consolidated Gold Fields share at
12.79 pounds ($22.38).
   Consolidated Gold Fields' shares plummeted on news of the
referral, falling 106 pence ($1.85) to finish at 11.39 pounds
($19.97) on London's Stock Exchange.
   Graham Birch, an analyst with the London investment firm
Kleinwort Grieveson Securities Ltd., said, the commission's decision
was a setback for Minorco. But he said the commission likely would
rule in Minorco's favor and that Minorco could then revive its bid.
   Gold Fields has raised strong objections to being acquired by a
company that is South African-controlled. Minorco is the
Luxembourg-based investment arm of the South African gold and
diamond mining giants, Anglo American Corp. and De Beers
Consolidated Mines Ltd. The wealthy South African Oppenheimer family
holds unspecified stakes in the latter two companies.
   Minorco is unlikely to return to its former role of passive
investor in Gold Fields, which it has played since first taking a
significant stake in the company in the early 1980s, analysts agreed.
   Gold Fields Chairman Rudolph Agnew said at a news conference that
the company plans to continue its defensive tactics, including
taking steps to boost its share price. Agnew, who said he was
``delighted'' by the decision to turn the case over the monopolies
commission, would not elaborate on what steps Gold Fields might take.
   Trade Secretary Lord Young, who referred the matter to the
monopolies commission, asked it to report to him within three months.
   The investigation will center on the proposed takeover's impact
on strategic metals, titanium and zircon in particular, a spokesman
at the Department of Trade and Industry said.
   ``It was thought a merger would lead to greater concentration of
the world's supply, which would be a potential detriment to users in
the U.K.,'' said the department spokesman, who spoke on condition he
was not identified.
   Titanium, a metal largely used as a whitener in paints, also is
used in jet engines. Zircon is mainly used as a refracting agent in
glass and steel furnaces, but is also a critical substance in
nuclear submarines and power plants, and in rocket nose cones.
   One possible course of action that could satisfy the commission
would be for Minorco to sell Consolidated Gold Fields' interests
related to the strategic metals titanium and zircon, analysts said.

<HEAD>Mid-October Sales Up for U.S. Makers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. automakers say they sold 14.8 percent more
cars and light trucks in mid-October than they did one year ago,
when the stock market crash and lack of dealer incentives kept
buyers away from showrooms.
   Automakers on Tuesday reported selling 318,664 cars and light
trucks during the Oct. 11-20 period this year, compared with 246,835
during the same period last year.
   There were nine selling days in mid-October this year and eight
last year, so the percentage change is based on the daily sales rate
rather than on total sales for the period.
   For months, the year-to-year sales comparisons have been colored
by heavy use of incentives in the summer and early autumn of 1987.
But most of those incentives expired Oct. 1, 1987, while incentives
continued this month, further fogging comparisons.
   Sales in mid-October 1988 were beginning to return to a more
normal pace, said analyst Kathleen Heaney of Nikko Securities Co.
International Inc.
   ``We're beginning to compare against a very weak period last
year, including the October 19 stock market crash,'' she said.
``You're probably going to see the same kind of numbers in the next
10-day period.''
   Among the Big Three automakers, Chrysler Corp. car sales rose to
29,269 this year from 19,909, a 30.7 percent increase on the basis
of daily sales in the mid-October period. This year, Chrysler has
sold 873,107 cars, compared with 775,401 cars it had sold by Oct. 20
last year, a 12.1 percent rise.
   Part of the mid-October increase, Heaney said, is attributable to
Chrysler's shifting some small-car production in 1987, and the
introduction of two popular large cars.
   ``You have the (Dodge) Dynasty and (Chrysler) New Yorker which
were launched at this time last year and those sales ... have been
strong all year,'' she said. ``That helps build this number up.''
   Ford Motor Co. reported a 14.4 percent surge in its car sales in
mid-October, going to 59,613 this year from 46,335 last year. So far
this year, Ford has sold 1,803,920 cars, an 8.9 percent rise from
the 1,650,391 cars it sold through Oct. 20 last year.
   General Motors Corp., the nation's largest automaker, said it
sold 93,086 cars during mid-October, up 8.1 percent from the 76,509
cars it sold during the same period last year. In 1988, GM's car
sales have increased 0.3 percent to 2,984,066 from 2,962,654 last
year.

year.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,

<HEAD>Kraft Tells Philip Morris It Would Consider Higher Buyout Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GLENVIEW, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kraft Inc., determined to retain its
independence or drive up the price of any takeover, has told hostile
suitor Philip Morris Cos. Inc. it would negotiate only if Philip
Morris raised its $90 a share takeover bid to more than $110 a share.
   In a strongly worded letter Tuesday, Kraft Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer John Richman said his company was determined to
push ahead with a defensive recapitalization plan that it proposed
when Kraft rejected Philip Morris' $11 billion buyout offer.
   ``The recapitalization plan will take place only if our
shareholders approve it,'' said Richman in a letter to Hamish
Maxwell, his counterpart at Philip Morris.
   ``Kraft will not pressure its shareholders, nor will Kraft permit
you to stampede them,'' said Richman.
   Kraft stock, which soared $10 a share on Monday, closed down $3 a
share at $99 Tuesday in active New York Stock Exchange trading.
   Kraft contends the recapitalization announced Sunday would pay
shareholders more than $110 a share in cash and securities.
   The suburban Chicago-based company has acknowledged that interest
and principal payments for such a program are estimated at more than
$12.4 billion. And analysts say Kraft _ maker of Velveeta cheese,
Sealtest ice creams and a raft of other fresh and frozen food
products _ would increase its debt tenfold to finance the plan, and
would be forced to sell some operations to pay for it.
   Even so, Richman indicated Kraft will not be pressured into
accepting terms its board considers inadequate.
   ``Kraft was not `for sale' and is not `for sale.' There is no
auction of Kraft ... If Philip Morris or another company truly
wishes to negotiate with Kraft, a simple phone call proposing (the
sweetened price) is all that is necessary,'' said Richman.
   New York-based Philip Morris's response suggested that call
wouldn't be forthcoming soon.
   ``Everybody from the market itself to arbitrageurs to people who
have evaluated the matter have questioned whether their
recapitalization is worth anywhere near $110,'' a spokesman for
Philip Morris who refused to be named said Tuesday.
   ``As for the letter, we're evaluating our options,'' he said.
``And at the moment, we have nothing more to say about it.''
   Both the market and some analysts reacted unfavorably.
   ``Quite frankly, Philip Morris' offer looked like a pretty good
beginning,'' said John Maxwell Jr., who tracks the food industry for
Wheat First Securities Inc. of Richmond, Va.
   ``While I thought Kraft might get a few dollars more, at $90 a
share, the (first takeover) offer was already about 15 for 16 times
the earnings for 1988 _ a pretty good premium.''
   John Bierbusse, analyst with A.G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis,
said the letter contained nothing new.
   ``Obviously, Kraft felt some need to clarify the position it
expressed with the recapitalization. But I think it's safe to call
the $110 figure overvalued.''
   Kraft already has been restructuring for several years to shed
its non-food operations.

<HEAD>Dollar Slightly Higher In Quiet Trading, Gold Also Up Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose slightly in quiet European trading
this morning as the market waited for release of the preliminary
report on U.S. economic growth in the third quarter.
   Gold prices also were up slightly in calm trading.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the third-quarter gross national
product figures scheduled for release later today would probably
provide some guidance to the market.
   One Frankfurt dealer said the market expects a 3 percent to 3.5
percent rise in the GNP. ``It's nothing much to look forward to,''
the dealer said, noting that the GNP expanded at a 3 percent pace in
the second quarter.
   A trader in Rome predicted the GNP figures would have little
impact on the foreign exchange market.
   ``Maybe it will move the waters for about 10 minutes, but the
dollar is basically trendless,'' he said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.07 yen to a closing 126.80 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted higher at 126.85 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.7913 West German marks, up from 1.7860; 1.5190
Swiss francs, up from 1.5175; 6.1175 French francs, up from 6.1100;
2.0173 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0170; 1,332.30 Italian lire, up
from 1,332.00; and 1.2015 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1990.
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost
$1.7525 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.7535 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $407 a troy ounce, down
from Tuesday's late bid of $407.25. But at midmorning, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a higher recommended price of
$407.50.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $407.40, up from $407 bid late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.24 to close at a bid $409.76.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.24 a troy
ounce, down from Tuesday's late bid of $6.25.

   The dollar inched down against the Japanese yen
today, while share prices rose on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, a 139.95-point winner
Tuesday, added another 199.11 points, or 0.73 percent, to finish
trading at 27,620.60. The Nikkei quickly gained 99.51 points when
the morning session began and continued rising afterwards.
   A broker with Daiwa Securities said dealers who had been
restrained by uncertainty over Emperor Hirohito's continuing illness
finally began reacting to favorable economic indicators and started
buying stocks.
   ``People were looking around for a wide variety of issues,'' he
said, speaking anonymously. He added that this helped boost
Wednesday's trading volume, which was estimated at 1.9 billion
shares on the first section.
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at 126.80 yen,
down 0.07 yen from the previous day's close of 126.87 yen. The
currency opened at 126.67 yen and slightly fell while moving in a
tight range of 126.64-126.80 yen.
   The dollar-yen rate changed very little with many dealers waiting
on the sidelines, according to a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo.
   ``Although dollar-buying by speculative investors increased on
the Tokyo market, the dollar did not recover much mainly because
overseas markets were selling it,'' he said, also speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Other dealers said investors were in a wait-and-see mood before
the release of the U.S. gross national product figure for the third
quarter due later today in Washington.

   The nation's economy grew at a modest 2.2 percent annual rate in
the third quarter, the poorest performance in about two years, the
government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said the summer drought, a deterioration
in the nation's trade performance and a drop in government purchases
of defense equipment were responsible for the week growth.
   The changes left the gross national product, the broadest measure
of the economy's health, rising at the slowest pace since a 1.4
percent increase in the fourth quarter of 1986.
   The GNP advance was down from increases of 3.4 percent in the
first quarter and 3 percent in the second quarter of this year.
   In the bond market, a sensitive barometer of inflation and
interest rate trends, prices rallied following the report. The
Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was up about $5 per $1,000 face
amount, while its yield fell to 8.87 percent from 8.93 percent
Tuesday.
   The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that total orders for
durable goods fell $5.0 billion to a seasonally adjusted $117.7
billion last month, pulled down by dramatic declines in the volatile
defense and transportation sectors.
   The dollar edged lower against the British pound and Japanese yen
but managed to rise against other major currencies. The pound was
quoted in late New York trading at $1.7515, up from $1.7501 late
Monday, while the dollar declined to 126.80 yen from 127.02 yen.
   The stock market finished narrowly mixed as a trading frenzy in
takeover issues subsided. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
gained 3.02 points to close at 2,173.36.
   Currency traders took the decline in durable goods orders as a
sign that the U.S. economy could be slowing down, something that
would tend to reduce demand for dollars by foreign investors.
   But economists were reluctant to conclude that the nation's
manufacturing boom is ending.
   In other economic news on Tuesday:
   _The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing
homes fell 2.2 percent in September after a surprisingly strong
summer. The decline occurred despite a housing boom in California.
   _Automakers reported that sales of U.S.-made cars and light
trucks rose 14.8 percent in mid-October from a weak period a year
earlier.
   _The government said wages in the past 12 months have risen an
average 3.9 percent. Private employer costs for benefits have soared
6.7 percent _ more than double the previous year _ largely on
increases in Social Security taxes.
   The durable goods report for September fits in with other signs
of a slowdown last month, including the second consecutive decline
in retail sales and a drop in manufacturing employment.
   But analysts said it was too soon to declare that manufacturing,
which has driven robust economic growth this year, is slowing
significantly.
   A boom in export sales, fueled by the lower value of the dollar,
has kept factories humming. Manufacturers in turn have invested
heavily to expand the capacity of their plants, spurring the fastest
growth in capital spending since 1984.
   Durable goods, items expected to last three or more years,
include a wide range of manufactured items, from refrigerators and
other household appliances to large computers and battleships.
   Orders had jumped 5.7 percent in August, plummeted 7.4 percent in
July and soared 8.7 percent in June.

   Share prices were higher at midday Wednesday, but
trading was sluggish amid nervousness ahead of Thursday's release of
British trade figures for September.
   The market's positive tone came in part from a steady trend in
sterling and British government bonds, dealers said. Recent weakness
in the pound hit equities earlier in the week as worries surfaced
that interest rates might be pushed higher to support the British
currency.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was up 7.1
points, or 0.4 percent, at 1,854.9 at midday.
   Volume was thin, with just 224.4 million shares changing hands,
compared with 214.9 million shares at the same time Tuesday.

   Spurred by strong exports, South

   The surplus was $1.12 billion in September 1987. The previous
record was $1.3 billion last June, the bank said.
   The current account broadly measures a country's financial flow
and includes trade in goods and services and other transfers.
   Officals at the central bank said South Korea's current account
surplus was expected to reach $13 billion by year's end, exceeding
the previous record of $9.85 billion last year.

   The stock market headed lower today in an
unenthusiastic response to new evidence of slowing economic growth.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 14.93 to 2,158.43 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 366 up, 545 down and
477 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 27.29 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The government estimated this morning that the gross national
product grew at a 2.2 percent annual rate, after adjustment for
inflation, in the third quarter of the year.
   That fell short of most advance estimates, and marked the slowest
pace since the final three months of 1986.
   Wall Street has been looking for evidence of slower business
expansion growth as reassurance that the economy was not approaching
the point of overheating.
   But the details in the latest data did not support hopes for an
improved international trade balance, increased business investment
and a slackening in consumer spending.
   The dollar weakened after the report was issued and so, after a
brief period of hesitation, did stock prices as well.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down 1[ at 121}; General Electric, down \ at 44]; Eastman
Kodak, down | at 48\, and International Paper, down { at 47\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.84 to 158.03. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .53 at 303.85.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 3.02 to 2,173.36.
   Declining issues slightly outpaced advancers on the NYSE, with
701 up, 727 down and 525 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 155.19 million shares, against 170.59
million in the previous session.

   Before Wang was sentenced his lawyer, Ira L. Sorkin, told the
judge his client ``fully recognizes the seriousness of the crimes.
At no time has he sought to minimize his involvement or the
seriousness of what he has done.''
   Sorkin said, ``He's broke, he has no job, he's unable to finish
his education, he has no place to live except with relatives. He
disgraced his family and hurt the firm that trusted him.''
   Wang, wearing a gray suit with dark dotted tie, told Duffy, ``I'm
deeply sorry for what I've done. I've incurred a lot of debts and
losses of other people. I'm going to try to make amends for it.''
   But Duffy, calling it a particularly troubling case, rebuked Wang
because he had grown up in an affluent family and no excuse for what
he did.
   ``Apparently, the first time you could have been a crook, you
were,'' Duffy said.
   ``In the eyes of society, a person who knowingly goes out to harm
the world, becomes a person who must be punished,'' the judge said.
   Duffy said a fine was inappropriate because Wang had no money.
   ``As far as I can figure out, you're worth zero,'' the judge
said. ``Therefore any punishment at all has to be in the area of
imprisonment.''
   Duffy gave Wang one month to get his affiars in order before
surrendering to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons. The exact location has
not been determined, but Sorkin told reporters afterward he would
try to have Wang placed in a facility near his family, who live in
the Chicago area.
   Sorkin declined to comment on the appropriateness of the
sentence, saying, ``I don't try to second-guess judges.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John McEnany also declined to comment on
the sentence. He also would not comment on possible efforts to
prosecute Lee, who is believed to be in Hong Kong.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy grew at a modest 2.2 percent
annual rate from July through September, the weakest performance in
almost two years, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department blamed the weak growth rate on the impact
of the summer drought, a deterioration in the country's trade
performance and a drop in government purchases of defense equipment.
   The changes left the gross national product, the broadest measure
of the economy's health, rising at the slowest pace since a 1.4
percent increase in the fourth quarter of 1986.
   The GNP advance was down from increases of 3.4 percent in the
first quarter and 3 percent in the second quarter of this year.
   With the slower growth came an easing in inflationary pressures
as a price index tied to the GNP rose at an annual rate of 4.4
percent from July through September, down from 5.5 percent in the
second quarter.
   Many economists viewed the GNP report as good news because the
slowdown should reduce the need for the Federal Reserve to drive
interest rates higher as a way of dampening demand in an overheated
economy.
   ``The burden will certainly be off the Fed to tighten because of
inflationary pressures,'' said Michael Evans, head of a Washington
forecasting firm. ``This appears to be heading us toward the soft
landing everyone was looking for.''
   Commerce Undersecretary Robert Ortner said that the latest GNP
report shows the economy is still enjoying steady growth in the
expansion following the 1981-82 recession.
   ``Next month marks the sixth anniversary of this economic
expansion,'' he said. ``With good policy direction and a bit of
luck, we can break the all-time record expansion of almost nine
years achieved during the 1960s.''
   The 2.2 percent GNP growth rate was sharply lower than had been
expected. Many private analysts had been looking for growth of
around 3.2 percent in the third quarter, even higher than the second
quarter.
   The weaker-than-anticipated showing threw in doubt the ability of
the economy to meet the Reagan administration's projection of 3.5
percent growth for the entire year.
   Reaching that level will require an increase of 3.4 percent in
the fourth quarter. Given the fact that many analysts believe the
economy has begun to slow, a rebound in growth in the final three
months of the year is not considered likely.
   The government said growth in both the second and third quarters
was depressed by the drought.
   Without the loss of farm output, the economy would have raced
ahead at a 4.3 percent rate in the second quarter and 2.8 percent in
the third quarter.
   Also depressing growth in the third quarter was the first
quarterly deterioration in the country's trade performance in a
year. The deficit between imports and exports widened at an annual
rate of $2.7 billion in the third quarter.
   This setback was blamed on the fact that imports, which had
fallen in the second quarter, shot up by 12.4 percent, swamping a
10.1 percent rise in imports.
   Government spending dropped at a rate of $2.7 billion in the
third quarter, after having risen by $7.4 billion in the second
quarter. The turnaround was blamed on a big decline in defense
purchases.
   Before today's report, many economists had been looking for the
economy to turn in its best growth performance since 1984, the last
presidential election year.
   In that year, the GNP had shot up by 6.4 percent, a giant
increase that many believed helped President Reagan win re-election.
   George Bush has been campaigning on a prosperity theme this year,
citing the fact that the country is now enjoying a peacetime record
six straight years of economic growth.
   The various changes left the GNP, after adjusting for inflation,
rising at a rate of $22.1 billion in the third quarter to a new
level of $4.007 trillion.
   Consumer spending, which has propelled growth throughout the long
recovery, continued to provide much of the momentum in the third
quarter, rising at a rate of 3.5 percent, up from a 3 percent
increase in the second quarter.
   Business investment, which has been surging this year as industry
rushed to expand production facilities, rose by 4.6 percent in the
third quarter, down from a 15 percent jump in the second quarter.
   Residential construction, which has been weak this year, rose a
modest 1.3 percent in the third quarter.

   Ford Motor Co. said today its earnings
rose 21.8 percent to a record in the third quarter compared with the
same three-month period last year, based on strong overseas sales.
   The nation's No. 2 automaker said it earned $856.3 million, or
$1.78 per share, in the July-September period, up from $703.2
million, or $1.38 per share, during the third quarter of 1987.
   Revenue rose nearly 16 percent to $17.7 billion from $15.3
billion a year earlier.
   Ford's stock fell 37{ cents a share to $53.62{ a share by
midmorning on the New York Stock Exchange as the overall market lost
ground.
   The earnings during the quarter were down 48.4 percent from the
company's industry record of $1.66 billion in earnings in the second
quarter. Typically, third-quarter earnings are lower than other
quarters for automakers because of factory retooling to gear up for
the new model year, which traditionally begins Oct. 1.
   ``The Ford team's successful effort worldwide to provide products
with improved quality and good customer value again is evident in
our third-quarter results,'' Ford Chairman Donald Petersen and Vice
Chairman Harold Poling said in a joint statement.
   The company said its overseas earnings amounted to $384 million
during the quarter, up 249 percent from the $110 million earned from
overseas operations during the period last year.
   In the United States, the company's earnings fell 20.4 percent to
$472 million during the third quarter this year from $593 million
during the period last year. Ford blamed the performance on higher
costs for new products and lower earnings by Ford's Financial
Services Group.
   General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp. are expected to announce
their third-quarter earnings figures Thursday.
   For the first nine months of the year, Ford's earnings rose 12.2
percent to $4.1 billion, or $8.53 a share, on sales of $60.9
billion, compared with earnings of $3.7 billion, or $7.17 a share,
on sales of $52.9 billion, a 12.2 percent increase.
   For the first two quarters of 1988, Ford posted industry world
records, making $1.62 billion in the January-March period and $1.66
billion in the April-June period.
   In the first two quarters of this year, Ford said its
record-setting profits also were bolstered by strong international
sales, mostly from Europe. Ford's domestic sales fell during the
first half of the year compared with the first six months of 1987,
because of incentives, higher labor and material costs, and
development of new products.
   Ford said losses in its Financial Services Group and product
costs were offset partially by higher shares of the car and truck
markets and more efficient manufacturing processes.
   The Financial Services Group, which includes Ford Credit, First
Nationwide, U.S. Leasing and the company's international credit
operations, added 35 cents per share to third-quarter earnings, 14.6
percent less than the group contributed during the third quarter of
last year.
   The company said benefits from a lower tax rate and increased
receivables were offset by lower earnings at Ford Credit and First
Nationwide.

   Stephen Wang, a former rookie securities analyst
who pleaded guilty to participating in the second biggest insider
trading case in history, was sentenced to three years imprisonment
today by a federal judge who told him, ``You had a brilliant future
and you blew it.''
   Wang, 24, stood motionless as U.S. District Court Judge Kevin
Duffy lectured him about his illegal act before imposing the
sentence, which also includes three years' probation.
   Wang, who would be eligible for parole after a year, could have
been sentenced to five years and heavy fines for each of three fraud
counts against him.
   Shaking his head, Duffy said, ``Stephen Wang, I hope to God you
never end up in a court of law again.''
   Wang, a former junior analyst at the investment firm Morgan,
Stanley & Co., admitted to scheming with Taiwan-born businessman
Fred C. Lee to profit on secret tips about impending corporate
takeovers that Morgan Stanley was handling. Lee, who is not in the
United States, allegedly made $19 million on the information
provided between July 1987 and April 1988, and paid $200,000 to Wang.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission, which sued the pair in
late June, had demanded the return of the illegal profits plus
triple damages for a total of $76 million, making it the second
biggest insider trading case behind that of convicted felon Ivan
Boesky.
   In 1986, Boesky agreed to pay a $100 million penalty to settle
charges of trading on insider information. He is serving a
three-year prison term after pleading guilty last year to conspiring
to file a false statement with the SEC.
   Before Wang was sentenced his lawyer, Ira L. Sorkin, told the
judge his client ``fully recognizes the seriousness of the crimes.
At no time has he sought to minimize his involvement or the
seriousness of what he has done.''
   Sorkin said, ``He's broke, he has no job, he's unable to finish
his education, he has no place to live except with relatives. He
disgraced his family and hurt the firm that trusted him.''
   Wang, wearing a gray suit with a dark, dotted tie, told Duffy,
``I'm deeply sorry for what I've done. I've incurred a lot of debts
and losses of other people. I'm going to try to make amends for it.''
   But Duffy, calling it a particularly troubling case, rebuked Wang
because he had grown up in an affluent family and had no excuse for
what he did.
   ``Apparently, the first time you could have been a crook, you
were,'' Duffy said.
   ``In the eyes of society, a person who knowingly goes out to harm
the world, becomes a person who must be punished,'' the judge said.
   Duffy said a fine was inappropriate because Wang had no money.
   ``As far as I can figure out, you're worth zero,'' the judge
said. ``Therefore any punishment at all has to be in the area of
imprisonment.''
   Duffy gave Wang one month to get his affairs in order before
surrendering to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons. The exact location of
his imprisonment has not been determined, but Sorkin told reporters
afterward he would try to have Wang placed in a facility near his
family, who live in the Chicago area.
   Sorkin declined to comment on the appropriateness of the
sentence, saying, ``I don't try to second-guess judges.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John McEnany also declined comment on the
sentence. He also would not comment on possible efforts to prosecute
Lee, who is believed to be in Hong Kong.

<HEAD>Analysts: Cray Earnings Revision Hurts Credibility On Wall Street</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Will be led by 5:30 p.m. EDT with closing stock price.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cray Research Inc.'s announcement that its
1988 earnings growth would be less than expected not only caused one
of the largest one-day declines in the supercomputer maker's stock
but also hurt its credibility on Wall Street, analysts say.
   ``Cray is getting savaged by earnings revisions,'' said Michael
Geran, an analyst in New York for Nikko Securities Co. International
Inc.
   Earlier this year, Cray predicted 10 percent earnings growth for
1988, but on Monday it reduced that to 5 to 7 percent.
   On Tuesday, Cray's stock on the New York Stock Exchange lost $9
to close at $59.87{, a decline of 13.1 percent on a trading volume
of nearly 1.7 million shares. It slipped another 12{ cents in early
trading today to $59.75 a share.
   In the past two years, the stock has traded has high as $135 a
share.
   Analysts said the one-day decline Tuesday was the largest they
could remember for Cray, and they attributed it to Monday's surprise
announcement.
   ``I think there's been credibility damage, and there will be a
lingering impact,'' said Gary Smaby, a Minneapolis-based analyst for
Needham & Co. Inc. in New York.
   ``The fact is that we've seen nothing but news of decreasing
earnings expectations for the last year and a half, and a lot of
investors are fatigued with the story,'' said Jeffrey Canin, an
analyst for Hambrecht & Quist in San Francisco.
   ``Investors looking to get into the stock now are going to have
to take a longer-term investment horizon, about 12 to 18 months,''
Smaby said. ``There will be no meaningful (earnings and revenues)
growth next year.''
   Cray said the decline in anticipated 1988 earnings is primarily
the result of an additional $10 million in spending on the Cray-3
supercomputer, the latest development of company founder Seymour
Cray.
   Next year's revenues are expected to be adversely affected by
increasing trade-in allowances and a shift toward computers being
leased rather than sold, the company said.
   Canin said Cray is moving through a difficult product transition
period from the Cray-2 to the not-yet-introduced Cray-3 and from the
enhanced versions of its older Cray X-MP supercomputers to the new
Cray Y-MP.

<HEAD>A&P Withdraws Offer For Delchamps</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTVALE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supermarket giant A&P today withdrew a $210
million tender offer for Delchamps Inc., a day after directors of
the Mobile, Ala.-based grocery chain rejected a higher merger
proposal.
   At a meeting late Monday, Delchamps directors decided A&P's
proposal to acquire the chain for $32-a-share, or $32 a share in a
friendly transaction was inadequate.
   James Wood, chairman and chief executive of The Great Atlantic &
Pacific Tea Co. called that proposal a ``final'' offer. The company
had a $30-a-share tender offer outstanding.
   A.F. Delchamps Jr., chairman of the board and president of the
company that bears his name, replied: ``We would hope that Mr. Wood
can be taken at his word, since we agree with him that the
dissension brought on by this takeover fight is not in the best
interest of our company or our shareholders.''
   Joel Swanson, a Delchamps spokesman, said the nine-member board
unanimously rejected the sweetened offer. A&P began trying to buy
Delchamps two years ago, but this year became more aggressive by
launching a tender offer.
   Delchamps attorney James H. McDonald Jr. said the board's
decision was based on a number of factors, including Delchamps
recent store expansion efforts and other programs designed to
enhance the value of the company.
   He said the board's decision was also based upon the advice of
counsel that such a takeover could pose antitrust problems.
   Delchamps has a federal court suit pending in Mobile against A&P
on the antitrust allegations. A&P, which is 52 percent owned by the
Tengelmann Group of West Germany, filed a countersuit.
   Delchamps had sales of about $700 million last year. A&P had
sales of $9.6 billion in 1987 from its 1,170 stores in this country
and Canada.
   Delchamps has 103 stores in Alabama, Mississippi, Florida and
Louisiana, and six liquor stores.

   The stock market declined slightly today in an
unenthusiastic response to new evidence of slowing economic growth.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 4.97 to 2,168.39
by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 458 up, 686 down and
535 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 61.24 million shares at
midmorning.
   The government estimated this morning that the gross national
product grew at a 2.2 percent annual rate, after adjustment for
inflation, in the third quarter of the year.
   That fell short of most advance estimates, and marked the slowest
pace since the final three months of 1986.
   Wall Street has been looking for evidence of slower business
expansion growth as reassurance that the economy was not approaching
the point of overheating.
   But the details in the latest data did not support hopes for an
improved international trade balance, increased business investment
and a slackening in consumer spending.
   The dollar weakened after the report was issued and so, after a
brief period of hesitation, did stock prices as well.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down } at 122[; General Electric, down \ at 44]; Eastman
Kodak, down } at 48[, and International Paper, down { at 47\.
   Bethlehem Steel, by contrast, rose ] to 20| in active trading.
The company reported sharply higher operating earnings for the third
quarter.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.27 to 158.60. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .54 at 303.84.

<HEAD>Four Big Banks Ask Fed For Underwriting Powers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four major commercial banks have asked the
Federal Reserve Board for broad powers to underwrite and deal in
corporate securities after Congress failed to pass legislation
granting such authority.
   The applications by Citicorp, Chase Manhattan Corp., J.P. Morgan
& Co. and Bankers Trust New York Corp. were sent to the New York
Federal Reserve Bank on Tuesday, according to a Fed spokesman.
   Banking experts say they expect most other big banks to follow
suit.
   ``If Congress can't agree to do it the banks will attempt every
possibility they can,'' Don Ogilvie, an executive vice president
with the American Bankers Association, said Wednesday.
   The move by the four banks could set the stage for a battle
between Congress and the Fed over which body will determine the
future structure of the banking industry.
   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has supported banks' efforts to win
broader securities powers, and Manuel Johnson, a Fed governor, said
recently that the central bank would look favorably on bank
applications for greater securities powers if Congress adjourned
without passing legislation.
   Attempts by Congress to repeal the Depression-era Glass-Steagall
Act, which separates commercial and investment banking, have been
underway for six years.
   The most promising bill by William Proxmire, D-Wis., and chairman
of the Senate Banking Committee, died in the House, along with more
restrictive bill passed by the House Banking Committee.
   After it appeared his bill was doomed, Proxmire encouraged banks
to turn to the Fed for broader powers.
   In their applications, Citicorp, Chase, Morgan and Bankers Trust
sought permission to underwrite and deal in corporate debt.
   Chase, Morgan and Bankers Trust also sought permission to deal
and underwrite stock, with Chase and Bankers Trust adding preferred
stock to their wish list.
   Two weeks ago, Chase President Thomas LaBrecque had vowed to seek
Fed approval if efforts to pass legislation failed.
   Banks have maintained that they need expanded powers to compete
with foreign banks that can underwrite securities in this country,
while critics maintain such powers could endanger the safety of the
nation's banking system.
   Last spring the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling
that allowed the Fed to grant more than a dozen banks authority to
underwrite commercial paper, municipal revenue bonds,
mortgage-backed securities and securties backed by consumer loans.

<HEAD>Inside Trading Bill Tries to Restore Greed-Fear Balance</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 4th graf, The bill ... to show President Reagan expected
to sign bill. Also moving on general news wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gordon Gekko, the ruthless inside trader in the
movie ``Wall Street,'' had a motto _ ``Greed is good'' _ that to
many encapsulated the philosophy of freewheeling corporate merger
speculators.
   Members of Congress, after passing the first legislative response
to the wave of insider trading scandals that erupted two years ago,
are hoping to replace the motto with another _ ``Greed is
dangerous.''
   ``Greed and fear are competing emotions, but until now there has
not been a proper balance between the two. I think now the fear of
apprehension is going to be at least as great as the lure of
greed,'' said Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., chief sponsor of the
bill and chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees the
securities markets.
   The bill passed the House 410-0 last month and by a voice vote in
the Senate early Saturday morning in the waning hours of the 100th
Congress. The securities industry's chief lobby group acquiesced to
the legislation and President Reagan is expected to sign it.
   Its key provisions would:
   _Increase the maximum criminal penalties for insider trading from
five years in jail to 10 years, and boost fines from $500,000 to
$2.5 million for a company and from $100,000 to $1 million for an
individual.
   _Hold firms liable to fines for the actions of their employees if
the firms ``knowingly or recklessly'' fail to detect and prevent
insider trading.
   _Authorize the Securities and Exchange Commission to offer a
bounty to tipsters of up to 10 percent of any fine collected.
   _Codify the right of investors to sue inside traders if they lost
money by trading in the same securities and at the same time as
insiders.
   _Permit the SEC to issue subpoenas and investigate inside trading
on behalf of foreign countries, with the idea that foreign countries
would offer reciprocal privileges to the United States.
   The SEC and the industry had been pushing for a legislative
definition of inside trading, which until now has been defined by
regulators and the courts.
   But, to win the support of House Energy and Commerce Chairman
John Dingell, D-Mich., the bill leaves inside trading undefined.
   Dingell believes a written definition would in effect become a
road map to evasion, providing defense attorneys with loopholes. The
industry complains it is unfair to give only vague guidance.
   Markey predicted the most immediate effect of the bill will be to
change the attitude toward insider trading, a crime that is both
hard to detect and difficult to prove.
   ``Jail is the greatest fear these white collar criminals have,''
Markey said. In addition, firms, because of the new liability
provisions, ``can't be like the three monkeys and say just because
they are deaf, dumb and blind they can get off,'' he said.
   John C. Baldwin, president of the North American Securities
Administrators Association, an organization of state regulators,
said he hopes the most immediate psychological effect will be on
small investors who have been scared out of the market by the
perception that the little guy can't get a fair deal trading in the
same stocks as big-time arbitragers.
   ``If John Q. Public feels like he's the only guy not making a
profit and the inside traders are cutting all the good deals, he's
going to take his business elsewhere. The first thing this bill does
is give the individual investor the feeling that someone cares about
him,'' he said.
   The impact from provisions granting individuals the right to sue
insiders and offering bounties to informers may take longer to
emerge, but ultimately could be more profound.
   ``We're in a litigious society. If people or their lawyers can
find a way to go after deep pockets, they'll usually do it,'' said
Edward I. O'Brien, president of the Securities Industry Association.
   At the urging of the SIA, Markey made the threshold for suing
firms _ the knowing or reckless clause _ tougher than originally
proposed.
   The SIA also has reservations about the bounties, as does SEC
Chairman David S. Ruder, who has said juries may not believe a
witness who was paid a bounty.
   ``It's somehow a little offensive to me. It's a little bit in the
Big Brother tradition,'' O'Brien said.
   But Markey argues that bounties have worked well for the IRS in
catching tax cheats and, he said, he is working on a plan to offer
Ruder an incentive to use bounties despite his qualms.
   The SEC under Ruder has sought more money to hire additional
enforcement attorneys. Markey said next year he'd like to find a way
to give the agency a cut of any extra fine revenue that is produced
by offering bounties.

   Grain and soybean futures prices opened mixed to
slightly lower today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Analysts called the market featureless.
   Soybean futures were mostly lower because of favorable weather
reports in the growing regions of South America and sizeable
domestic stocks.
   Wheat futures nudged ahead following a U.S. Department of
Agriculture report that India would purchase 1 million tons under
the export bonus program, and smaller overnight buys by Japan and
the Philippines may have supported prices as well.
   On the opening, wheat was 1\ cent lower to { cent higher, with
the contract for delivery in December at $4.07} a bushel; corn was {
cent to 1 cent lower, with December at $2.73 a bushel; oates were
unchanged to 1 cent higher, with December at $2.36{ a bushel; and
soybeans were 3 cents lower to 2{ cents higher, with November at
$7.58{ a bushel.
   Livestock and pork futures were lower on the Chicago Mercantile

   Live cattle were .15 cent to .40 cent lower, with the December
contract at 74.35 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .12 cent to .35

<HEAD>Tenneco Initiates Cash Offer for Stock Buyback</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a move to increase its stock value, Tenneco
Inc. initiated a cash tender offer today to buy back 18 million
shares of its own stock for more than $1 billion through a ``Dutch
auction.''
   Tenneco Chairman James L. Ketelson said the sale of Tenneco Oil
earlier this month and the proposed repurchase of 12.18 percent of
Tenneco's total outstanding stock demonstrates the company's
commitment to increasing shareholder value by concentrating its
resources on its ``most promising'' opportunities.
   However, some on Wall Street were expected to view the terms of
the share repurchase as disappointing.
   In a Dutch auction, which Tenneco launched early today,
shareholders specify the price at which they are willing to sell
their stock back to the company, within a range established by the
buyer.
   Based upon the number and price of the shares tendered, Tenneco
officials said they will determine the single per share price within
a specified $50-$55 range that will permit the company to buy all 18
million shares. Tenneco then will buy the stock tendered at that
price or less, subject to possible proration.
   The cash sales will not be subject to the usual transaction costs
associated with open market sales, Tenneco officials said.
   John Olson, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said a
Dutch auction is ``probably the most sensible way'' to buy back
stock. But he said Tenneco's offer is not likely to win acclaim on
Wall Street where analysts were expecting a more conventional offer
at a higher price of $60 or so.
   On the New York Stock Exchange Tenneco's shares were trading at
$50{ this morning, up from $49.875 on Tuesday.
   Olson said Houston-based Tenneco is passing up a ``God-given
opportunity'' to build the strongest balance sheet in years.
   ``Buying back stock may be attractive to some shareholders, but
it doesn't augment the company for the long term,'' Olson said.
   He attributed that buy-back decision to Tenneco's management
being under pressure to ``do something for the shareholders.''
   ``They sold off their crown jewel (Tenneco Oil). That gives them
a great opportunity to go into the next business downcycle with a
strong balance sheet and golden opportunities to acquire companies
in related areas that would be hard hit by any recession,'' Olson
said.
   Tenneco's offer is not conditioned upon any minimum number of
shares being tendered. The only condition, company officials said,
is that Tenneco receive at least $1.5 billion in proceeds from its
$7.3 billion sale of Tenneco Oil. The tender offer is set to expire
at midnight Nov. 28.
   After paying for the stock, the company will use the remainder of
the proceeds to reduce its hefty debt of $8.5 billion.
   With the sale of its oil and gas properties, Tenneco's biggest
units will be the profitable natural gas pipeline and its Case IH
farm equipment manufacturing sector.
   In addition, Tenneco maintains shipbuilding, automotive,
packaging and chemicals units.

   Employment costs have risen faster than
inflation over the past 12 months, but largely because of soaring
benefit costs primarily from higher Social Security taxes rather
than wage gains, according to new government data.
   Wages in the 12 months ended Oct. 1 rose an average of 3.9
percent, the Labor Department said Tuesday, compared with a 4.2
percent increase in consumer prices over the same period.
   But benefit costs have soared more than 6.7 percent _ more than
double the 3.1 percent gain during the previous 12 months, the
department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said.
   The combined effect of the pay raises and higher benefit costs
sent total employer costs up 4.7 percent in the 12 months ended Oct.
1, compared with a 3.4 percent rise in the previous 12-month period,
it said.
   The steep increase in benefit costs resulted primarily from a
rise last January in employers' Social Security tax rate from 7.15
percent to 7.51 percent, the government said.
   But there also were large increases in health insurance costs the
first nine months of this year, it noted. And for the first time,
the government is calculating lump-sum bonus payments from union
contracts and profit-sharing arrangements as a benefit.
   Previously those bonuses had not been included as either wages or
benefits.
   Non-union employees continued to get bigger percentage pay raises
than union members _ a trend begun in 1983 _ except for blue-collar
workers in manufacturing.
   The Labor Department said wage rates among union members rose an
average 2.9 percent in the past 12 months, compared with 3.9 percent
for non-union workers. In the previous 12-month period, union wages
rose an average 1.7 percent, compared with 3.8 percent for non-union
employees.
   ``This pattern reversed when limited to blue-collar workers in
manufacturing,'' the bureau said, with wage increases in the past
year averaging 3.2 percent for union members and 2.8 percent for
non-union workers.
   Including the lump-sum bonus arrangements that have become a norm
in many labor contracts, especially in manufacturing, total employer
compensation costs have risen the same 4.5 percent for union and
non-union workers nationwide, the bureau said.
   John Zalusky, an economist for the AFL-CIO, called the statistics
``refreshing.''
   ``We expected they were in that range,'' Zalusky said. ``They're
(the government) beginning to show in fact what is really going on
out there in the world, but there still is a good way to go.''
   For example, Zalusky cited the last round of steel industry
contracts in which the union conceded pay cuts to companies then
operating at losses in exchange for a share of future profits or
stock transfers if no profits occurred.
   ``The statistics are now picking up the profit distributions but
not the stock transfers for what essentially is a debt owed
workers,'' he said. ``In the future I expect them to start putting
in the value of stock ownership plans and in the distant future
retraining funds, such as those negotiated with the auto companies.''
   Despite the disparity in percentage wage increases in recent
years, union workers continue to make 35 percent more than non-union
workers _ an average gap of $123 a week in 1987 compared with a gap
of $119 in 1986 _ on a nationwide basis, according to government
data.
   Among white-collar workers, wage increases averaged 4.2 percent
over the past 12 months, compared with 4 percent the previous 12
months, the government said. Blue-collar wages have increased 3.3
percent and 2.6 percent, respectively, over the same two periods.
   The biggest pay gains, 5.6 percent on average, were among
business and health service workers, followed by average increases
of 4.9 percent for professional and technical employees.
   Managers and executives, along with state and local government
workers, have averaged the same 4.7 percent wage gains over the past
year. The average pay increase among private industry workers was
3.7 percent.
   By regions, the biggest pay increases over the past 12 months
have been in the Northeast, 4.6 percent, followed by the South at
3.8 percent. Average raises in the West and Midwest were 3.2 percent
and 2.9 percent, respectively.
   In a separate report, the Labor Department said annual pay rose
an average 4.6 percent among the 101 million workers with jobs in
the nation's 317 metropolitan areas last year.
   Kenosha, Wis., with large pay increases in manufacturing and
construction, had the biggest average increase, up 10.6 percent _
from $18,666 in 1986 to $20,648 in 1987.
   The New Haven-Waterbury-Meriden area of Connecticut and the
Monmouth-Ocean City, N.J., metropolitan areas were next with average
annual pay increases of 8.4 percent last year.
   On the other end of the scale, workers in Flint, Mich., with a
large decline in employment and falling wages in manufacturing,
suffered an average pay loss of 4.2 percent _ from $26,633 in 1986
to $25,514 last year.
   Other cities where average pay fell last year were Anchorage,
Alaska; Anderson, Ind.; Enid, Okla.; Lawrence, Kan.; Lansing, Mich.;
Midland, Texas; Middlesex-Somerset-Hunterdon, N.J.; and Pine Bluff,
Ark.
   Despite the decline, Anchorage maintained the highest average pay
level in the country at $28,486. New York City was next at $28,179,
followed by the Bridgeport-Stamford-Nowalk-Danbury area of
Connecticut at $27,832 and San Jose, Calif., at $27,748.
   Jacksonville, N.C., again had the lowest average annual pay at
$13,246, followed by three Texas border areas:
McAllen-Edinburg-Mission at $13,311, Brownsville-Harlingen at
$14,087 and Laredo at $14,093.

   The stock market lost ground today in an
unenthusiastic response to new evidence of slowing economic growth.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 8.53 to 2,164.83
by noontime on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 493 up, 745 down and
527 unchanged.
   The government estimated this morning that the gross national
product grew at a 2.2 percent annual rate, after adjustment for
inflation, in the third quarter of the year.
   That fell short of most advance estimates, and marked the slowest
pace since the final three months of 1986.
   Wall Street has been looking for evidence of slower business
expansion growth as reassurance that the economy was not approaching
the point of overheating.
   But the details in the latest data did not support hopes for an
improved international trade balance, increased business investment
and a slackening in consumer spending.
   The dollar weakened after the report was issued and so, after a
brief period of hesitation, did stock prices as well.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down ~ at 122; General Electric, down \ at 44]; Eastman
Kodak, down [ at 48}, and International Paper, down { at 47\.
   Bethlehem Steel, by contrast, rose 1\ to 21{ in active trading.
The company reported sharply higher operating earnings for the third
quarter.
   Sears Roebuck, widely rumored in recent days to be considering a
restructuring or other transaction, gained 1\ to 45.
   Wickes climbed 1{ to 9]. Following the recent abandonment of a
$12-a-share management buyout plan for the company, a group of
investors offered to take it over for $11.25 a share.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.62 to 158.25. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .68 at 303.70.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 91.74 million shares at noontime,
up from 77.69 million at the same point Tuesday.

   Bethlehem Steel Corp. today said its
third-quarter profit more than tripled on the strength of the steel
industry's recovery.
   Net income for the period rose to $101.4 million, or $1.18 per
share, up from $30.4 million, or 46 cents per share, a year earlier.
Third-quarter sales rose 23.3 percent to $1.43 billion from $1.16
billion a year earlier.
   Bethlehem attributed its improved performance to increased
shipments, higher productivity and prices and lower financing costs.
   ``We expect our steel shipments to continue at relatively strong
levels through the balance of the year and our prices to remain
firm,'' said Chairman Walter F. Williams. ``There has been some
softening in our order entry ... but we believe it to be a temporary
situation as underlying steel consumption remains strong.''
   For the first nine months, the company earned $337.3 million, or
$4.17 per share, up nearly three times compared to $102.8 million,
or $1.61 per share, a year earlier.
   Nine-month sale rose 22 percent to $4.16 billion from $3.41
billion a year earlier.

<TEXT>
   Wickes Cos. Inc. agreed today to be
bought by two New York investment groups that will pay $517 million
in cash and assume about $2.2 billion in outstanding Wickes' debt.
   Announcement of the takeover by Blackstone Capital Partners and
Wasserstein, Perella Partners follows by 12 days the withdrawal of a
management-led bid to take the retailing and manufacturing
conglomerate private.
   Wickes management accepted the investors' bid of $11.25 a share,
a discount from the $12 a share offered by a group led by Wickes
chairman Sanford Sigoloff in late August and withdrawn Oct. 14.
   The investors' bid values Wickes stock at about $517 million.
Assumption of debt would bring the total value of the deal to $2.7
billion, the companies said in a news release.
   Officers of Blackstone and Wasserstein, Perella would become
co-chairmen of Wickes, apparently displacing Sigoloff, who brought
the company out of bankruptcy in 1985.
   Wickes released a statement from Sigoloff saying the deal would
benefit shareholders, but was silent on the executive's future.
Wickes spokesman Michael Sitrick refused to discuss Sigoloff's
future and said Sigoloff was declining interviews.
   Blackstone and Wasserstein, Perella will have equal say in
directing the company, which operates furniture stores and the
Builders Emporium home improvement stores in Southern California and
has groups that make automotive fabrics, wallpaper and aircraft
parts.
   Co-chairmen will be James R. Birle, 52, a Blackstone partner and
former vice president of General Electric Co., and Robert B. McKeon,
34, a managing director of Wasserstein, Perella, the companies
announced.
   Management had been shopping the company around since the August
management buyout offer, which was designed to draw higher bids.
   That tender offer to stockholders by a Sigoloff-led group
included an unusual provision delaying any stock purchases for 60
days, and specifically left the door open to outside offers.
   It was withdrawn Oct. 14, six days before the expiration date.
Sigoloff's group attributed the withdrawal to new projections that
Wickes' operating income for the year would be $40 million below
what had been forecast at the time the offer was made.

   General Motors Corp.'s credit arm said today an
interest rate pinch cut its third-quarter earnings by 25.5 percent
from a year earlier.
   General Motors Acceptance Corp. reported net income of $241.9
million from its auto financing, insurance and mortgage operations
in the three months ended Sept. 30, down from $325 million for the
third quarter of 1987.
   GMAC said the decline was due primarily to a narrower margin
between interest earned on money loaned out and interest paid to
obtain the funds. Its average cost of borrowings worldwide was 8.41
percent for the quarter, compared with 7.89 percent in the same
period last year.
   Also, GMAC financed or leased 496,000 new cars and trucks in the
United States during the period, a 42 percent decline from a 1987
third-quarter boosted by factory-supported financing incentives.
   GMAC's earning assets reached $90.6 billion as of Sept. 30, up 2
percent from a year earlier, the company said.
   Also reporting earnings today was GM's computer-services
subsidiary, Electronic Data Systems Corp., which said new commerical
contracts helped boost third-quarter net income 17 percent as
revenues grew 9 percent.
   EDS reported third-quarter net income of $95.9 million, or 79
cents per share of the GM Class E common stock that has its returns
based on EDS earnings. That compared with $82.3 million, or 68 cents
a share, in the third quarter of 1987.
   Revenues were $1.22 million, up from $1.13 million in the
year-earlier quarter.
   GM's third major subsidiary, GM Hughes Electronics, was expected
to report its earnings later. GM is scheduled to report its earnings
Thursday.

   RJR Nabisco Inc. said today it has ended talks
with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. over joining with the investment
firm in a $20.3 billion leveraged buyout of the food and tobacco
conglomerate.
   Following a meeting of outside directors here, Nabisco President
F. Ross Johnson said the group concluded the Kohlberg proposal was
``not in the best interest of the company, its employees or the
diverse communities it serves.''
   Johnson said Nabisco would continue to work with Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc., its financial partner, to ``explore the possibility of
making an offer to acquire the company.''
   Last week the Nabisco management team announced it was
considering offering $75 a share to take the company private, a bid
that would be worth about $17 billion. On Monday, New York-based
Kohlberg said it planned to launch a $90-a-share tender offer for
the maker of such products as Oreo cookies and Winston cigarettes.
   A spokesman for Kohlberg said the firm had no immediate comment.
   Nabisco management, Shearson and Kohlberg have discussed various
combinations of a joint bid, so far without success.
   On the New York Stock Exchange, trading in Nabisco stock was
halted because of an imbalance in buy and sell orders. The last
trade prior to the halt put Nabisco shares at $85.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
higher Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade after sinking in six
of the past eight sessions.
   Analysts described the trading as generally featureless.
   ``Ninety percent of the trading today was short-covering,'' said
Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in
Chicago. ``More and more people holding short positions started to
cover as they realized the market wasn't going to break any lower.''
   In a short sale, a trader sells a borrowed security in the
expectation that prices will head lower before he must replace it.
   Wheat futures got some support from a U.S. Department of
Agriculture report that India would purchase 1 million tons of wheat
under the export bonus program, and smaller overnight buys by Japan
and the Philippines may have supported prices as well.
   Some spillover strength, as well as speculation that lower prices
would help stimulate export business, nudged prices ahead in the
surrounding pits.
   On the close, wheat was unchanged to 2 cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.09 a bushel; corn was \ cent
to 2\ cents lower, with December at $2.76 a bushel; oats were
unchanged to 2 cents higher, with December at $2.36{ a bushel; and
soybeans were 6 cents lower to { cents higher, with November at

   An estimated 250 Enron Corp. employees are being
laid off as part of a reorganization program that will combine
positions in the company's corporate staff and natural gas pipeline
group, the company said Wednesday.
   Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay cited intense competition for
natural gas markets coupled with low sales prices as primary reasons
for the staff reductions.
   Affected employees were notified Wednesday, Executive Vice
President Richard D. Kinder said. Some of the reductions will be
effective immediately, while others will occur during the remainder
of the year.
   Enron has about 6,900 employees, including 3,000 in Houston.
   The cuts include jobs at all levels, including officers. Human
Resources Vice President Luther Snow is one executive whose position
was eliminated. The action follows the elimination of about 35 jobs
in Enron Oil & Gas Co., a subsidiary, in late September.
   Kinder said Enron expects the reorganization to save $15 million
a year.
   ``It is not a pleasant thing to do, but you can't operate in this
environment without paying attention to your staff costs,'' he said.
   Some of the affected employeees may be offered other jobs in the
Enron organization. Others will receive severance pay and assistance
in finding jobs elsewhere.
   In addition to the layoffs, the company is negotiating sales of
some oil and gas assets valued at between $200 million and $300
million, Lay said.
   The properties involved are primarily interests in wells and
fields operated by other companies and most sales should be
completed by year's end.

<HEAD>Ex-Morgan Stanley Whiz Kid Gets Three Years, Judge Calls Him a
Crook</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rookie Wall Street analyst, who once impressed
others as an ambitious go-getter, received three years imprisonment
Wednesday for his role in the nation's second-largest insider
trading fraud.
   ``You truly fall into the situation of a person who bites the
hand that feeds him,'' U.S. District Judge Kevin Duffy said, shaking
his head as he sentenced Stephen Wang, 24. ``You had a brilliant
future and you blew it.''
   Wang, who had held a promising junior analyst job at Morgan
Stanley & Co., pleaded guilty last month to fraud for conspiring
with Taiwanese businessman Fred C. Lee to profit in the stock market
on secrets about impending corporate takeovers that Wang stole from
the firm.
   He also pleaded guilty to a separate but much smaller insider
trading scheme involving another person, whom prosecutors have
declined so far to identify.
   Wang and Lee were first exposed in late June by the Securities
and Exchange Commission, which said Lee made about $19 million in
illicit profits and paid Wang $200,000 for tips provided between
July 1987 and last April.
   Morgan Stanley, which was deeply embarrassed and dismissed Wang
immediately, said through spokesman Peter Roche that ``We're pleased
justice has been served.''
   Lee's U.S. lawyer, James Morton, did not return telephone calls
for comment. Lee hasn't been charged with any crime and is believed
to be living in Hong Kong.
   The SEC has won court orders freezing the U.S. assets of Wang and
Lee and is seeking return of the $19 million plus triple damages for
a total of $76 million, making it the second-biggest insider trading
scam behind the Ivan Boesky scandal.
   A renowned stock speculator, Boesky paid the SEC a record $100
million in November 1986 to settle insider trading charges, a
stunning episode that signaled a government crackdown on Wall Street
crime. He was sentenced to three years imprisonment for conspiracy
to lie to the enforcement agency.
   The Wang-Lee case received widespread attention not only because
of the amount of money involved, but because both men presumably
were brazenly trading on inside information at the height of concern
about the Boesky affair. Many law enforcers said this showed insider
trading remains a deep-rooted problem.
   Wang could have been sentenced to five years imprisonment and a
$250,000 fine for each of three counts against him. But Duffy, a
former SEC regional administrator, said he wasn't imposing a fine
because Wang had no money.
   ``As far as I can figure out, you're worth zero,'' the judge
said. ``Therefore any punishment at all has to be in the area of
imprisonment.''
   Duffy did not explain the rationale for the three-year sentence,
which also includes three years probation. But he lectured Wang on
what the judge called inexcusable acts by a young man who grew up in
comfortable surroundings, enjoyed a good education and was en route
to a successful career.
   ``You did have practically every break society could give you,''
said the judge, but ``apparently the first time you could have been
a crook, you were.''
   Wang, wearing a gray suit and dark tie, fidgeted nervously before
Duffy pronounced the sentence and stood motionless while the judge
spoke. Aside from a few reporters and bystanders, the courtroom was
empty.
   ``I'm deeply sorry for what I've done,'' Wang told the judge.
``I've incurred a lot of debts and losses of other people. I'm going
to try to make amends for it.''
   Duffy gave Wang a month to settle his affairs before reporting to
the federal Bureau of Prisons. His lawyer, Ira L. Sorkin, said he
would try to have Wang placed in a facility near his family, who
live in the Chicago area.
   Sorkin, who like Duffy is a former regional SEC administrator,
declined to comment on the sentence. Assistant U.S. Attorney John M.
McEnany, who represented the government in the case, also declined
to comment.
   Wang grew up in Arlington Heights, Ill., attended the University
of Illinois and landed a coveted junior analyst job at Morgan
Stanley in June 1986. As a student, he excelled in economics and was
considered an aspiring entrepreneur because he had started his own
resume advisory service.
   The local newspaper, which published an admiring story about
Wang's business talents, quoted him as saying that ``if you love
what you do, money comes along with it.''

   Norfolk Southern Corp. reported Wednesday that
its third-quarter profit jumped 73.7 percent from a year earlier,
boosted by increased freight traffic and reduced labor costs.
   The freight railroad company said its net income in the three
months ended Sept. 30 rose to $179.4 million, or $1 a share, from
$103.3 million, or 55 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Third-quarter revenue was up 12.8 percent, to $1.16 billion from
$1.03 billion.
   Norfolk Southern, ranked as the nation's largest railroad company
in terms of revenue from railway business, is based in Norfolk, Va.
The results for the third quarter were announced at a meeting with
financial analysts in New York.
   Norfolk Southern said the latest results were the best quarterly
performance in its history. The company said it achieved a record
low railway operating ratio of 72.3, down from 81.8 in the third
quarter of last year. Railway operating ratio is the percentage of a
company's revenue that goes into operating its railroads.
   ``The year started off strong for us and has improved every
quarter, thanks to increasing traffic and reduced employee costs,''
Chairman Arnold B. McKinnon said.
   ``Although railway traffic was up 6.2 percent for the quarter and
5.3 percent for the first nine months, railway expenses remained
flat. We anticipate this trend will continue for the rest of 1988.''
   In the first nine months of the year, profit rose 30.1 percent to
$456.1 million, or $2.51 a share, from $350.5 million, or $1.85 a
share.
   Nine-month revenue increased 8.2 percent, to $3.30 billion from
$3.05 billion.

   The stock market pulled back today in an
unenthusiastic response to new evidence of slowing economic growth.
   The government estimated this morning that the gross national
product grew at a 2.2 percent annual rate, after adjustment for
inflation, in the third quarter of the year.
   That fell short of most advance estimates, and marked the slowest
pace since the final three months of 1986.
   Wall Street has been looking for evidence of slower business
expansion as reassurance that the economy was not approaching the
point of overheating.
   But the details in the latest data did not support hopes for an
improved international trade balance, increased business investment
and a slackening in consumer spending.
   The dollar weakened after the report was issued and so, after a
brief period of hesitation, did stock prices as well.

<HEAD>Occidental Profit Up; Coastal Earnings Decline</HEAD>

   Occidental Petroleum Corp. said Wednesday that third-quarter
earnings more than doubled because of strong gains in its chemical
unit, while Coastal Corp. said lower crude oil prices drove
quarterly earnings down sharply.
   Occidental's earnings surged 128 percent to $105 million or 38
cents a share in the three-month period ended Sept. 30, compared
with $46 million or 20 cents a share a year earlier.
   The Los Angeles-based company said revenue rose 16.7 percent to
$4.9 billion from $4.2 billion in the 1987 quarter.
   Occidental Chairman Armand Hammer said healthy advances in the
company's chemical operations offset declines elsewhere.
   ``Although Occidental has experienced the detrimental earnings
effects of lower oil prices, which in the third quarter of 1988 were
more than $4 a barrel less than last year, and the loss of our North
Sea oil production, we are pleased to report that our chemical
operations' earnings have significantly increased and have resulted
in Occidental's net income more than doubling compared to the third
quarter of 1987,'' Hammer said.
   Occidental owned the huge oil rig that exploded and sank July 6
in the North Sea, killing more than 160 people in the world's worst
oilfield disaster.
   Falling crude oil prices, caused by an excess supply on world
markets, has hurt earnings and revenue of most major U.S. oil
companies. But some have managed to compensate with gains in
refining and marketing operations.
   For the first nine months of 1988, Occidental's earnings totaled
$295 million or $1.23 a share, up 46 percent from $202 million or 90
cents a share a year earlier. Revenue totaled $14.1 billion, up 11
percent from $12.7 billion.
   Houston-based Coastal Corp. said earnings fell 21.4 percent in
the latest quarter to $9.2 million or 12 cents a share on revenue of
$1.8 billion, vs. $11.7 million or 17 cents a share on revenue of
$1.6 billion a year earlier.
   For the first nine months of 1988, Coastal's earnings rose 10.5
percent to $86.3 million or $1.45 a share, from $78.1 million or
$1.43 a share in the same period last year. The company's revenue
totaled $5.7 billion, up 16.3 percent from $4.9 billion a year
earlier.

<HEAD>Survey: Health Care Insurance Fraud Widespread, Costly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER VILES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four out of 10 Americans covered by health
insurance have encountered some form of insurance fraud, including
being billed for unnecessary tests or for medical services they
never received, according to a national survey commissioned by an
insurance company.
   The survey, which is to be released formally on Thursday, was
conducted for Aetna Life & Casualty, which estimates that health
care insurance fraud is responsible for about 10 percent of the $555
billion Americans spend on health care each year.
   ``The survey indicates that there is widespread public awareness
_ more than we thought _ that health insurance fraud is hurting
consumers,'' James L. Garcia, director of fraud investigations in
Aetna's Employee Benefits Division, said Wednesday in an interview.
   Garcia said consumers end up paying higher premiums to cover the
cost of fraud.
   However, the survey found that the most widespread form of health
care insurance fraud is one that few consumers complain about.
   Twenty-three percent of the respondents said their practitioners
had accepted insurance reimbursement as full payment, even though
their policies required the patient to pay a portion of the bill.
   Three out of five people required to pay a portion of their
medical bills said they would consider switching to a doctor who
practices that form of fraud.
   ``To us, that was an astonishing figure.'' Garcia said.
   He said the study indicated that practitioners who would alter
bills in that fashion were likely to practice other forms of fraud,
such as billing for unnecessary tests or services not provided.
   Ten percent of the survey respondents said they had been billed
for laboratory tests they felt were unnecessary, and 6 percent said
their practitioners had inflated charges.
   Other forms of fraud cited were billing for services not rendered
and charging more for services than had been discussed with the
patient.
   Sixty percent of those responding to the survey said they had no
experience with fraudulent tactics.
   Garcia said the study contained both good and bad news for
insurance companies. On the positive side, consumers seemed very
aware of the terms of their policies and often made an effort to
examine their bills.
   However, consumers were also likely to turn to practitioners when
they had doubts about their bills, he said.
   ``That's like being kidnapped and then asking the person who
kidnapped you whether he really meant it,'' Garcia said.
   To counter that, Garcia said Aetna plans to introduce a fraud hot
line.
   ``We're going to try to make it as easy as possible for consumers
to notify the insurance agency,'' he said.
   The survey found that consumers consider health-care insurance
fraud among the most serious forms of white-collar crime. Only stock
market insider trading was considered more severe.
   And a majority of the respondents, 55 percent, said practitioners
found guilty of fraud should have their licenses either suspended or
revoked.
   However, respondents to the survey ranked health-care insurance
fraud fifth when they were asked why medical costs and insurance
premiums have risen over the last several years.
   Eighty-four percent of those responding said they thought
malpractice suits and the cost of malpractice insurance were
responsible for the increased costs. And 53 percent blamed insurance
companies for causing the increases by seeking to increase their own
profits.
   The cost of new technology and general inflation were both cited
by 51 percent, followed by health care insurance fraud, blamed by 47
percent of the respondents.
   National Family Opinion conducted the survey for Aetna by mailing
a four-page questionnaire to 1,000 households in August. A total of
705 people responded, giving the survey a margin of error of plus or
minus 5 percent.
   Of those who responded, 91 percent said they had some form of
health insurance, and 24 percent said they were covered by Medicare
of Medicaid.

   The stock market retreated Wednesday as new
evidence of slowing economic growth failed to catch traders' fancy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 8.18 to 2,165.18.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
624 up, 814 down and 528 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 181.55 million
shares, against 155.19 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 216.82 million shares.
   The government estimated Wednesday morning that the gross
national product grew at a 2.2 percent annual rate, after adjustment
for inflation, in the third quarter of the year.
   That fell short of most advance estimates, and marked the slowest

   General Motors Corp.'s aircraft, auto-electronics
and computer-services subsidiaries reported third-quarter gains on
Wednesday while an interest rate pinch cut earnings at its financing
arm.
   General Motors Acceptance Corp., the credit arm, said its net
income sagged 25.5 percent for the three months ended Sept. 30
compared with the third quarter of 1987.
   Sales of a new air-to-air missile helped boost third-quarter
earnings 5.3 percent at GM Hughes Electronics Corp., comprising
Hughes Aircraft Co. and Delco Electronics Corp.
   Electronic Data Systems Corp., the computer-services arm, said
new commercial contracts contributed to a 17-percent earnings rise.
   GM is scheduled to report its companywide earnings Thursday.
   GMAC said net income from auto financing, leasing and mortgage
operations was $241.9 million for the three months ended Sept. 30,
down from $325 million in the third quarter of 1987.
   A narrower margin between the interest earned on money loaned out
and the interest costs to obtain the funds was the main cause of the
decline, GMAC said.
   The company said its average cost of borrowings worldwide rose to
8.41 percent in the third quarter, up from with 7.89 percent in the
same period last year.
   And GMAC said it financed or leased 496,000 new cars and trucks
in the United States during the period, a 42 percent drop from the
third-quarter in 1987 when business was boosted by factory-supported
financing incentives.
   For the first nine months of 1988, GMAC's consolidated net income
totaled $930.2 million, down from a record $1,218.2 million for the
same period last year.
   GMAC's earning assets reached $90.6 billion as of Sept. 30, up 2
percent from a year earlier, the company said.
   GM Hughes Electronics Corp. reported third-quarter earnings of
$180 million, or 45 cents a share of GM Class H common stock, an
issue the earnings of which are determined by GM Hughes Electronics'
performance.
   That compared with $171 million, or 43 cents a share, in the
third quarter of 1987. Quarterly revenues were $2.63 billion, up
from $2.52 billion a year earlier.
   Revenue rose as the armed forces built up inventories of Hughes'
Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile that recently entered
production, spokesman Bruce McCristal said.
   Revenues were partly offset by research and development costs for
the HS601 communications satellite, a new design that will be
capable of extending solar-power arrays up to 100 feet long,
McCristal said.
   He said a continuing increase in electronic equipment in cars and
trucks kept earnings on the rise at Delco.
   For the first nine months, GM Hughes Electronics reported
earnings of $633 million, or $1.58 a share, on revenues of $8.2
billion, up from $524 million, or $1.31 a share, on revenues of $7.8
billion in the first nine months of 1987.
   Electronic Data Systems Corp. reported third-quarter net income
of $95.9 million, or 79 cents per share of GM Class E common stock.
That was up from $82.3 million, or 68 cents a share, in the third
quarter of 1987.
   EDS revenues were $1.22 billion, up from $1.13 billion in the
year-earlier quarter.
   EDS, which provided GM's information services needs, said it
expanded its commercial computer services to include retailers such
as Riser Foods Inc. in Ohio as well as its international and
governmental customers and financial institutions.
   EDS reported net income of $280.7 million, or $2.30 a share, on
revenues of $3.24 billion for the first nine months of the year, up
from $218.9 million, or $1.80 a share, on revenues of $3.24 billion
in the same period last year.

<HEAD>Ford Sets 3rd Quarter Earnings Record, But Loses Ground in U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. reported record
third-quarter earnings Wednesday and enhanced its reputation as the
most profitable automaker in the country, although the performance
of U.S. operations declined.
   The No. 2 vehicle producer behind General Motors Corp. earned
$856.3 million or $1.78 a share in the three months ended Sept. 30,
vs. $703.2 million or $1.38 a share a year earlier, a 21.7 percent
gain that made it the best third quarter in Ford's history.
   Third-quarter sales totaled $17.73 billion vs. $15.25 billion, a
15.1 percent gain.
   In the prior four quarters Ford outearned much larger GM. The
biggest U.S. automaker and No. 3 Chrysler Corp. were expected to
report third-quarter earnings Thursday.
   Industry analysts anticipated Ford would continue its string of
impressive earnings gains. For each of the past ten quarters, Ford
has set new earnings records for itself.
   ``My guess is that they will earn $1.3 (billion) or $1.4 billion
in the fourth quarter,'' said David Healy, who follows the industry
for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ``In 1987, it was a little over $900
million, so it looks like the next quarter will be up again,
easily.''
   Despite the earnings outlook, Ford's stock price fell 87{ cents a
share to $53.12{ on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Third-quarter auto company earnings usually are lower than other
quarters because of factory retooling to gear up for the new model
year, which historically has started Oct. 1.
   Ford said earnings this past quarter were based largely on strong
overseas sales and not its U.S. business.
   ``We do have a declining (profit) margin in the United States and
that's been the case all year,'' said David McCammon, Ford's vice
president for finance and treasurer. ``The overseas margin has been
increasing because of outstanding results this year in Europe and
also Latin America has come back substantially.''
   He pointed to Ford's performance in Mexico and with Autolatina, a
joint venture with Volkswagen AG in Brazil and Argentina. Ford owns
49 percent of Autolatina and McCammon declined to be specific about
its results.
   However, he said, ``Autolatina went from a substantial loss in
the last third quarter to a profit this quarter.''
   Analyst Ron Glantz of Montgomery Securities Inc. of San Francisco
said, ``I estimate (Autolatina) earned $70 million this quarter
versus a loss of $56 million last quarter.''
   Overall, Ford said it earned $384 million from overseas
operations in the third quarter of 1988, up 249 percent from the
$110 million earned overseas during the period last year.
   In the United States, the company earned $472 million in the
third quarter, down 20.4 percent from the $593 million earned a year
earlier.
   Because of the depressed U.S. results, profit sharing for
unionized workers will decline this year compared with last,
McCammon said. Although he wasn't specific , McCammon said it would
fall somewhere between the $3,700 average per worker in 1987 and the
$2,100 average the year before.
   McCammon blamed much of the U.S. decline on development of new
products, lower earnings by the company's Financial Services Group
and a problem with what kinds of cars were available.
   He said that during the quarter, the company produced 30 percent
fewer, high-profit Thunderbirds than a year earlier, while making
more Ford Tempos and Mercury Topazes, which carry less of a per-car
profit.
   Healy agreed, saying: ``The cost of everything they buy is up. So
that and the shutdown of the T'bird and Cougar had an effect on
their earnings for the U.S.''
   The Financial Services Group, which includes Ford Credit, First
Nationwide, U.S. Leasing and the company's international credit
operations, added 35 cents per share to third-quarter earnings, 14.6
percent less than the group contributed during the third quarter of
last year.
   The company said benefits from a lower tax rate and increased
billings were offset by lower earnings at Ford Credit and First
Nationwide.
   For the first nine months of the year, Ford earned $4.1 billion
or $8.53 a share, up 12.2 percent from earnings of $3.7 billion or
$7.17 a share a year earlier. Sales totaled $60.9 billion vs. $52.9
billion, a 15.1 percent gain.

   The dollar fell Wednesday to its lowest point
since late June as traders reacted to a report of unexpectedly
modest growth in the U.S. economy. Gold prices rose.
   Slower growth reduces the chance that the Federal Reserve will
raise interest rates to cool off inflation, analysts said. Lower
U.S. rates would reduce demand for dollars.
   The Commerce Department said the gross national product, the
broadest measure of the economy, grew at a 2.2 percent annual rate
in the third quarter. The market had forecast a 3 percent to 3.5
percent rise.
   The GNP advance, down from increases of 3.4 percent in the first
quarter and 3 percent in the second quarter of this year, was the
smallest rise since a 1.4 percent increase in the fourth quarter of
1986.
   ``What this does is bring us closer to potentially lower interest
rates,'' said Craig Sloane, a currency analyst at Smith Barney,
Harris Upham & Co.
   The currency market's reaction to the GNP report was unusually
strong, partly because the market was prepared to drive the dollar
down anyway, traders said.
   In contrast, the bond market, which usually rallies at signs of
slower growth, posted only a modest increase.
   In Tokyo, before the report was released, the dollar eased 0.07
Japanese yen to a closing 126.80 yen. Later in London, after the
report's release, it dropped to 125.85 yen. In New York, the dollar
fell to 125.71 yen from 126.80 yen Tuesday.
   The dollar also fell against the British pound. It cost $1.7600
to buy one pound in late London trading, more expensive than $1.7535
late Tuesday. The pound rose to $1.7610 in New York from $1.7515
Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.7750 West German marks, down from 1.7903; 1.5042
Swiss francs, down from 1.5183; 1.1993 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2012; 6.0595 French francs, down from 6.1230; and 1,322.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,333.75.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.7745 marks, down from 1.7860; 1.5065 Swiss
francs, down from 1.5175; 6.0725 French francs, down from 6.1100;
2.0005 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0170; 1,323.50 Italian lire, down
from 1,332.00; 1.1988 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1990.
   In Hong Kong, gold rose $1.24 a troy ounce to close at a bid
$409.76. In London, gold fell to $407.05 a troy ounce from $407.10
Tuesday. In Zurich, it rose to $407.10 an ounce bid from $407
Tuesday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for
near-month delivery rose to $408.30 a troy ounce from $406.40
Tuesday.
   Republic National Bank of New York said gold was bid at $408.15
an ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $406.60 late Tuesday.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid price of $6.21 a troy
ounce, down from $6.25 late Tuesday. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for near-month delivery rose to $6.224 an ounce from $6.221.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The proposed $2.2 billion merger between
PacifiCorp and Utah Power & Light was approved Wednesday by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, but only on the condition that
the new company provide space on its transmission lines for other
utilities to ship electricity.
   In a 70-page order, the commission said requirements that the
merged company ``wheel'' electricity from other utilities were aimed
at alleviating fears it would dominate the sale of power from the
inland Northwest to the Southwest.
   ``We believe that the conditions ... are the minimum necessary to
alleviate these likely anticompetitive effects so as to make the
merger consistent with the public interest,'' the commission said.
   The merger would create the nation's 13th largest utility serving
more than 1.2 million customers in seven western states _
California, Washington, Oregon, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming and Utah.
   The commission's handling of the case has been closely watched by
the utility industry, which has been swept by talk over the last
several years of deregulation and increased competition.
   The commission, in its order, asserted its right to condition a
merger so that it would be ``consistent with the public interest''
and found that without imposing conditions in this case the merger
would ``enhance'' the ability of the new company to ``exercise
monopoly power.''
   The commission ordered that in the short-term the new company
must set aside a portion of its transmission line capacity for
others to use.
   In the long-term, the commission said the new company had an
``absolute obligation'' to provide transmission service to any
utility that makes a ``bona fide'' request even if that means the
company has to build new transmission facilities.
   The directors of both PacifiCorp and Utah Power are expected to
meet early next week to decide whether to proceed with the proposed
merger. The companies have 60 days to notify FERC of their decision
or they can request a rehearing.
   ``We need to satisfy ourselves that conditions imposed on the
merged company will not materially impair our ability to acheive the
customer and shareholder benefits we expect as a result of the
combination,'' David Bolander, president of PacifiCorp's utility
subsidiary Pacific Power & Light, said in a statement.
   Patrick Slattery, a Pacific Power spokesman, said that the
company was somewhat surprised by the conditions imposed by the
commission.
   ``They appear to be unlike anything we have seen before,'' said
Slattery. ``It will take some time to get a firm grip on what the
implications are.''
   Shareholders of PacifiCorp, based in Portland, Ore., and Utah
Power, based in Salt Lake City, along with regulatory agencies in
each of the states and the Department of Justice and Federal Trade
Commission have raised no objections to the merger.
   But almost two dozen public and private utilities and utility
organizations stretching from Arizona to South Dakota opposed the
merger fearing it would create a mega-utility that would dominate
Western energy markets.
   In June, a FERC administrative law judge had recommended
rejection of the proposed merger because of the impact it might have
on utility competition.
   PacifiCorp and Utah Power officials have said the merger could
result in annual savings of up to $150 million over the first five
years, stable rates for Pacific Power customers and a drop in rates
of up to 10 percent for Utah Power customers.
   Pacific Power and Light currently serves about 670,000 customers
in Oregon, Washington, California, Montana, Idaho and Wyoming.
   Utah Power has about 510,000 customers in Utah, Wyoming and Idaho.

<HEAD>Varity Ends Acquisition Talks With Troubled Fruehauf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canada's Varity Corp. has halted talks on the
possible acquisition of Fruehauf Corp., and the troubled
Detroit-based truckmaker said Wednesday it would explore other
options.
   Fruehauf reported a net loss of $41.5 million on sales of $1.84
billion in 1987.
   Varity spokesman J.R. Nowling said he didn't expect further
efforts to acquire Fruehauf though he didn't rule out discussions
about its Kelsey-Hayes automotive subsidiary.
   Fruehauf has struggled with large debts, high interest payments
and operating losses in its trailer and maritime operations since
managers took control of the company in December 1986 with huge
borrowings in a financial transaction known as a leveraged buyout.
   Fruehauf will continue to explore alternatives including
disposition of all or part of Kelsey-Hayes, its only profitable
unit, Fruehauf spokesman David Hladik said.
   Hladik said he knew of no specific suitors, but even during
discussions with Varity, ``We never closed the door to other
offers.''
   Formerly called Massey-Ferguson, Toronto-based Varity makes farm
and industrial machinery. Fruehauf makes truck trailers and
automotive and maritime products.
   Varity ended discussions with Fruehauf after a review of
Fruehauf's records and assets, Nowling said.
   He declined to elaborate on reasons. Asked if Varity will enter
further negotiations for Fruehauf, he said, ``I wouldn't think so.''
   Nowling said he didn't know if talks were likely regarding
Kelsey-Hayes, which makes auto and truck and industrial parts and is
a leading supplier of antilock brake systems.
   But he said, ``We announced when we initiated discussions in
August that Kelsey-Hayes was our primary interest.''

<HEAD>Industry Report Fuels Tumultuous Day in Petroleum Futures</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS lead to higher demand levels sted lower. Picks up 2nd

<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Petroleum futures prices finished mostly higher Wednesday
following a tumultuous day of trading set off by a report showing a
sharp drawdown in gasoline reserves and higher demand levels.
   In other markets, livestock and pork futures fell; grain and
soybean futures rebounded slightly after declining for four straight
sessions, and precious metals were mixed in featureless trading.
   Gasoline stocks were considered to be ``the wild card'' in an
American Petroleum Institute report released after the markets had
closed Tuesday. The API report showed gasoline stocks fell by more
than 3 million barrels _ almost twice what some analysts expected.
   That, coupled with a rising demand for the product, pushed the
price of unleaded gas to 54.50 cents a gallon at one point on the
New York Mercantile Exchange.
   ``We're seeing demand of about 8 million barrels a day, and we've
only seen that six or seven times in the last two years ... and not
at all during the period from the late '70s until 1986,'' said Peter
Beutel, assistant director of Elders Futures Energy Group in New
York.
   ``We are back in the land of pre-conservation demand.''
   Still, many traders apparently believe gasoline may be near its
peak for the short term. Not only was there significant
profit-taking Wednesday, but many traders elected to reverse
previous positions, selling gasoline and buying heating oil.
   ``What you saw was everybody heading for the door at the same
time,'' said Jim Ritterbusch, a vice president at Carson Petroleum
Co. in Chicago. ``And the catalyst that set this in motion was the
fact that gasoline appeared so strong.''
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 15 cents to 19 cents
higher at the New York Mercantile Exchange, with the December
contract at $13.41; heating oil was .23 cent to 1.24 cents higher,
with November at 41.5 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was .35
cent lower to .20 cent higher, with November at 51.67 cents a gallon.
   Both livestock and meat futures were lower at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Pork futures were clobbered by a report released late Tuesday
that indicated the number of frozen pork bellies stored in
warehouses was the second-largest ever reported during October.
   ``That put a bearish shroud over everything on the floor,'' said
Chuck Levitt of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in Chicago.
   ``Cattle prices are suffering from a small pocket of heavyweight
cattle hanging over the market for the moment,'' he continued.
``They should have moved earlier this summer, but it will only take
a short while for them to get cleaned up and supplies to get tight
again.''
   Live cattle settled .25 cent to .85 cent lower, with December at
73.90 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .78 cent lower,
with October at 81.42 cents a pound; live hogs were .30 cent to 1.02
cents lower, with December at 41.27 cents a pound; and frozen pork
bellies were 1.58 cents to 2 cents lower, with February at 49.50
cents a pound.
   Analysts said the grain market was in need of fresh news, and
none was forthcoming Wednesday. But declining prices fueled ideas of
renewed export bnusiness and helped lay the groundwork for a modest
rally.
   Wheat futures got some support from a U.S. Department of
Agriculture report that India would purchase 1 million tons under
the export bonus program. The notion that lower prices would
stimulate export business nudged prices ahead in the surrounding
pits.
   Wheat settled unchanged to 2 cents higher, with December contract
at $4.09 a bushel; corn was \ cent to 2\ cents lower, with December
at $2.76 a bushel; oats were unchanged to 2 cents higher, with
December at $2.36{ a bushel; and soybeans were 6 cents lower to 4{
cents higher, with November at $7.61 a bushel.
   Precious metals, meanwhile, finished the day mixed after holding
to a narrow range at the New York Commodity Exchange.
   Prices moved to session highs early when the U.S. dollar fell
because of a lower-than-expected 2.2 percent rise in the
third-quarter gross national product.
   But the lack of follow-through buying, as well the interpretation
that the inflation indicators were not as strong as anticipated,
sent the metals drifiting.
   Gold settled $1.50 to $1.90 higher, with October at $408.30 a
troy ounce; silver was unchanged to 3 cents hgher, with October at
6.224 cents a troy ounce.
   Platinum, traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, settled 60
cents lower to 10 cents higher, with October at $536.40 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>West Point-Pepperell Adopts Severance Plan To Protect Employees In
Takeover</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Takeover target West Point-Pepperell Inc. has
adopted a sweetened severance plan for almost 6,000 employees that
provides increased benefits if they are fired within two years of a
hostile acquisition.
   A company official said Wednesday the plan has been considered
for some time and is not a direct reaction to this week's $1.4
billion bid for the west Georgia textile giant.
   Chicago-based Farley Inc., one of the nation's largest privately
owned conglomerates, Monday announced a $48-per-share tender offer
for Pepperell stock. West Point-Pepperell, the nation's largest
publicly owned textile and apparel company, has not responded,
advising stockholders to await a board recommendation that is
promised by next week.
   However, employees were informed of the severance program
Tuesday. D. Michael Roark, West Point-Pepperell vice president of
human resources, said Wednesday the program had been adopted last
week and was under consideration for some time.
   ``This is not something we did in response to Bill Farley,''
Roark said. William Farley heads the conglomerate which owns
underwear manufacturer Fruit of the Loom and other companies.
   ``We had been talking (about the plan) in the management group
for several months,'' Roark said in a telephone interview from the
company's West Point, Ga., headquarters.
   ``This was not, and we don't now consider it, `shark repellent,'
'' he said, referring to jargon used to describe tactics companies
use to fend off corporate raiders.
   A Farley spokesman said the company would have no comment on the
provision.
   Roark said the plan _ which guarantees at least three-months pay
to some 5,900 salaried and clerical employees _ would not involve
enough money to dissuade a suitor. However, he had no estimate on
the amount of money involved, saying it would depend on how many
employees were involved and their level of seniority.
   The decision, however, fits in with a series of moves West
Point-Pepperell has taken this year to strengthen its ability to
fight a takeover.
   In June, the company adopted a shareholder rights plan which
would allow the board to issue a special class of stock as a
dividend to current stockholders. The plan would take effect as soon
as a tender offer is launched or if someone purchases 10 percent of
its stock.
   Farley notified the company in May it was seeking up to 25
percent of West Point-Pepperell stock and so far has spent $88
million for 9.8 percent of the stock.
   Pepperell also has had in place for some time so-called ``golden
parachutes'' for executives, including a $1.39 million payout to
Chief Executive Officer Joseph L. Lanier Jr. if he were to be fired
by new owners.
   Those provisions have been challenged by Farley in federal court
and by a Pepperell stockholder, who filed a suit in state Superior
Court Tuesday, claiming stockholders are deprived of the highest
possible stock price.
   No action has been taken on either lawsuit.
   West Point-Pepperell is one of the first companies in the state
to take advantage of a new state antitakeover law adopted earlier
this year and patterned after similar laws in other states.
   The law, which took effect in March, limits a new owner's ability
to sell off parts of the company for five years.
   The severance plan covers all salaried and certain skilled
clerical workers, who Roark said in other places in the country
likely would be salaried workers.
   ``If within two years of a change of control, an employee covered
by the plan is terminated, they would receive the greater of two
weeks pay per year of service or three months' pay,'' Roark said.
   ``It institutionalizes the sort of severance payment that we
consider fair and reasonable in any event. It's about what we do
now,'' he said.
   ``We felt that is was important that if we did change control ...
some provision be in place to insure that (employees) were treated
as fair by the new management as we would.''

   Trans World Airlines Inc. and Pan Am Corp. on Wednesday reported
increases in their third-quarter profit from a year earlier, while
USAir Group Inc.'s net income was reduced by merger costs.
   New York-based TWA said its net income in the three months ended
Sept. 30 jumped 54.4 percent to $88 million, or $2.39 a share, from
$57.1 million, or $1.41 a share, a year earlier.
   Third-quarter revenue was up 4.9 percent to $1.27 billion from
$1.21 billion.
   TWA, the nation's seventh-largest airline, was taken private on
Monday by its chairman and owner, Carl Icahn.
   Lawsuits against the privatization have been filed by some TWA
shareholders and the pilots union at the airline. In addition, the
union representing TWA flight attendants has asked the Department of
Transportation to block the privatization and freeze the airline's
assets while it investigates Icahn's fitness to continue managing
TWA.
   The TWA pilots union joined the flight attendants' petition, and
the Consumer Federation of America has filed a similar petition with
the DOT.
   TWA General Counsel Mark Buckstein said recently that the carrier
plans to lease or buy about 60 new aircraft to upgrade its aging
fleet, at a cost of up to $1.5 billion.
   In the first nine months of the year, TWA's profit more than
doubled _ to $132.7 million, or $2.89 a share, from $55.2 million,
or 45 cents a share, a year earlier.
   The latest nine-month profit includes a special gain of $49.9
million from a cash payment awarded to TWA in a long-standing
lawsuit against its former owner, the late Howard Hughes.
   The TWA management's suit, originally filed in 1962, alleged that
the eccentric multimillionaire failed to provide the carrier with
adequate aircraft. Although a Delaware court decided in TWA's favor
last year, the payment was not made until the second quarter of 1988.
   Revenue in the first nine months rose 7.77 percent, to $3.33
billion from $3.09 billion.
   Pan Am, also based in New York, said its third-quarter net income
edged up 6.3 percent, helped by continuing improvement in profits
from its Northeast shuttle and Pan Am Express commuter operations.
   The eighth-largest U.S. airline reported that its profit in the
three months ended Sept. 30 rose to $67.4 million, or 47 cents a
share, from $63.4 million, or 45 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Third-quarter revenue expanded 13.7 percent, to $1.20 billion
from $1.06 billion.
   The company said the growth in revenue was boosted by strong
passenger traffic.
   ``In fact, Pan Am set a new quarterly record for revenue,
surpassing the levels reported during the time when the airline was
operating its Pacific division,'' Chairman Thomas Plaskett said.
   In the first nine months of the year, Pan Am had a net loss of
$21.0 million, widened from a loss of $19.8 million a year earlier.
   The loss occurred despite a 16.9 percent rise in revenue for the
nine months, to $3.18 billion from $2.72 billion.
   Washington-based USAir said its third-quarter profit was trimmed
4.5 percent by expenses related to its acquisitions of Piedmont
Aviation and Pacific Southwest Airlines.
   The nation's ninth-biggest airline saw its net income slip to
$68.5 million, or $1.58 a share, from $71.7 million, or $1.66 a
share, a year earlier.
   The decline occurred despite an 87.3 percent jump in
third-quarter revenue, to $1.48 billion from $790.8 million.
   In the first nine months, USAir's profit fell to $142.2 million,
or $3.28 a share, from $167.9 million, or $4.80 a share.
   Nine-month revenue surged to $4.22 billion from $1.87 billion.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Dismisses Grand Met Takeover Suit, Returns Case To
State Court</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Grand Metropolitan PLC is considering appealing a federal judge's
dismissal of its suit to strike down an Arizona law that would bar
its proposed $5.2 billion buyout of Pillsbury Co., an attorney for
Grand Met said Wednesday.
   U.S. District Judge Roger Strand in Phoenix also has denied Grand
Met's motion for a preliminary injunction to bar enforcement of the
Arizona state takeover law in the deal.
   Strand on Monday dismissed Grand Met's Oct. 4 lawsuit that
contended the Arizona law barring out-of-state takeovers of Arizona
businesses holding liquor licenses was illegal because it improperly
hindered interstate commerce and infringed on federal authority over
interstate securities dealings.
   Businesses owned by Pillsbury, the nation's fourth-largest food
company, includ the Bennigan's and Steak and Ale chains.
   Bennigan's has restaurants in Phoenix and Mesa, and because the
restaurants have liquor licenses the state liquor control
superintendant must approve any takeover of them by an out-of-state
company.
   Strand said the federal courts should defer to the state courts
when action at that level is pending, important state interests are
involved and the state proceedings provided ``an adequate
opportunity to raise the federal questions.''
   Philip J. MacDonnell, a Phoenix lawyer representing Grand
Metropolitan, said the company was considering an appeal of Strand's
decision.
   Grand Metropolitan, one of the world's biggest producers of
spirits, has said it would sell off Pillsbury's Steak & Ale and
Bennigan's restaurants because of laws in a number of states
prohibiting a liquor producer from owning retail liquor outlets.
   Grand Met filed its suit the same day it offered to buy Pillsbury
for $60 a share. Pillsbury since then has rejected the offer as
inadequate, and indicated it would present its shareholders with an
alternative to the British food, liquor and real estate conglomerate
by next Tuesday.
   Pillsbury stock closed at $60.62{, up $1.50 a share from
Tuesday's close, on Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange trading.
   The Minneapolis-based company's board of directors reportedly met
on Wednesday, although Pillsbury declined to comment on the reports
and Johnny Thompson, Pillsbury's vice president of public relations,
said the company had nothing to announce.
   Pillsbury also filed a lawsuit Oct. 4, in Maricopa County
Superior Court, claiming Grand Metropolitan's takeover attempt
should be blocked because it violates Arizona's Acquisition of
Control Act.
   Joseph E. Mais Jr., a Phoenix lawyer representing Pillsbury, said
Wednesday that he expects both sides to file motions quickly in the
state case but nothing had been scheduled.

<HEAD>Largest Caterpillar Local Says Yes To New Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The largest union local representing
workers at Caterpillar Inc. approved a tentative labor contract
Wednesday, virtually assuring ratification of the three-year deal
covering 17,500 employees in five states.
   Seventy-four percent of the members of United Auto Workers Local
974 who voted in East Peoria supported the tentative agreement while
26 percent opposed it, said local President Tony Green. He said he
could not give actual vote totals for Local 974, which has 10,033
members.
   Caterpillar spokesman Gil Nolde declined to comment on the vote.
   The tentative contract, worked out late last Friday by union and
company bargainers, includes a 3 percent wage increase and lump-sum
bonuses of about 3 percent. It affects workers in plants at 12
cities in Illinois, Iowa, Colorado, Tennessee and Pennsylvania.
   Another major provision is 100 percent job security to 85 percent
of the current workforce.
   Other provisions call for improved pension benefits, early
retirement allowances and night shift bonuses.
   Ratification votes are scheduled this weekend in Pontiac, Ill.,
Aurora, Ill., Memphis, Tenn., and Denver.
   Peoria-based Caterpillar, the world's largest manufacturer of
earth-moving equipment, is piling up the best sales and profits in
its 63-year history. Executives say 1988 could be the most
profitable, eclipsing 1981 when the company earned $578 million.
   The company's union workers now earn an average of $14.61 per
hour, or $30,388 per year.

<HEAD>Dean of Black Entrepreneurs Dead At 83</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 3rd graf bgng ``S.F. Fuller's...to CORRECT initials to

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   S.B. Fuller, known as the dean of black
entrepreneurs after he built a door-to-door cosmetics company into a
national company with more than 5,000 salesmen, has died at age 83.
   Fuller died Monday of kidney failure in St. Francis Hospital in
suburban Blue Island.
   ``S.B. Fuller's success and his personal precept that an
individual could achieve financial independence through
self-direction and hard work greatly influenced the Chicago minority
business scene in the 1940s and 1950s,'' said Gwynne Goodlet, a
Fuller Products Co. spokesman.
   At its peak in the 1960s, Fuller Products Co. included
newspapers, appliance outlets and department stores, as well as
farming and cattle interests.
   Fuller, who was unrelated to Fuller Brush company founder Alfred
C. Fuller, was the first black member of the National Association of
Manufacturers. He also trained other black business people,
including magazine publishers John H. Johnson and Mary Ellen Schadd
Strong and cosmetics magnate George Johnson.
   A native of Louisiana, Fuller left school after the sixth grade.
His mother, who died when he was 17, convinced him that the best way
out of poverty was door-to-door sales.
   After hitchhiking to Chicago, he became a salesman for the
Commonwealth Burial Association Insurance Co. By 1934, he had become
its manager.
   In 1935, he started Fuller Products with $25 borrowed on his car,
and then used door-to-door sales representatives to handle 30 items
from a little-known cosmetics line.
   Fuller Products peaked in the 1960s with sales of $10 million
annually and sales offices in 38 states. The company lost business
the 1960s, however, to boycotts by white supremecists and also by
blacks who objected to a Fuller statement that ``a lack of
understanding of the capitalist system and not racial barriers was
keeping blacks from making progress.''
   Fuller brought the company through a bankruptcy reorganization in
1971, and reported a profit of $300,000 in 1972.
   Fuller is survived by his wife, Lestine, and five daughters.
Burial services were scheduled Friday in Chicago.
