   Secretary of State George P. Shultz
indicated Tuesday that he and Philippine leaders have scored a
breakthrough in stalled talks on the future of U.S. military bases
in the Philippines.
   President Corazon Aquino said after Tuesday's discussions, ``We
both hope that the talks would be over by the end of this month.''
   Shultz told a news conference, ``I'm more than ever convinced
that there is a very strong mutuality of interest in the security
field and all the reason in the world that somehow we'll be able to
work out a continuing partnership.'' A review of the 41-year-old
bases agreement, which expires in 1991, has been marked by calls
from some people for more compensation from the United States and
by demonstrations against the U.S. military presence.
   The review began in April and stalled over the issue of how much
Washington should pay each year for the Subic Bay Naval Base, Clark
Air Base and four smaller military installations.
   Shultz, on a 36-hour visit to Manila, met with Mrs. Aquino,
Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus, Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos
and prominent legislators.
   He later left for Hong Kong, arriving there Wednesday for a
one-day stay. Hong Kong was the fifth stop on the secretary's
nine-nation Asian and Pacific tour. He earlier visited Thailand,
Malaysia and Indonesia and will proceed after Hong Kong to China,
South Korea, Japan and the Marshall Islands.
   Both the U.S. and Filipino sides refused to discuss details of
the compensation proposals.
   House speaker Ramon Mitra told reporters, ``If the Philippine
(side) gets favorable conditions, I presume this is going to
register very well among members of the house.''
   U.S. sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a
reasonable compromise on the bases could mean increased support by
Washington of Manila's war against the 19-year-old communist
insurgency.
   Under the present accord, the United States gives Manila $180
million a year in economic and military aid. The bases are the
largest U.S. military facilities outside the continental United
States.
   Manglapus said last April that $1.2 billion a year was a more
``realistic figure.''
   Shultz said the U.S. military had worked out options in case the
bases were ousted, but the best choice was to stay in the
Philippines.
   He said the two sides had ``perhaps identified some methods that
might work'' in reaching a compromise.
   Shultz also said the Philippine military had improved in the
past two years.
   ``There is a far greater degree of professionalism, they are
better equipped ... there is a clear mission and a record
increasingly of success,'' he said.
   Ramos said Shultz promised to expedite the delivery of U.S.
military equipment to the Philippine military. The United States
this year provided more than $85 million in military help.

<HEAD>Taiwan Eases Ban on Travel From China</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNIE HUANG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The governing Nationalist Party on Tuesday
eased a 39-year-old ban on visits to Taiwan by mainland China
residents and approved expanding indirect trade with Beijing to
include raw materials.
   The new policy toward rival Communist China approved by the 13th
Nationalist Party congress after several days of debate also
suggested Taiwan journalists and athletes may be allowed to go the
mainland.
   Under the new policy, the Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang, will
review requests from mainland Chinese to travel to Taiwan if close
relatives are gravely ill or die.
   Intellectuals from mainland China ``who are opposed to
Marxism-Leninism or have fought to maintain academic freedom'' will
be allowed to come to Taiwan if invited.
   Further relaxation will depend on ``whether and how the mainland
responds to our new policy,'' Hsiao Chang-le, head of the
Nationalists' Mainland Operations Department, told a news
conference.
   Last October, the Nationalists ended a longstanding ban on
travel to China so Taiwan residents could visit relatives for
family reunions. More than 100,000 have made the trip since.
   The ban on travel across the Taiwan Straits was imposed when the
Nationalists fled to this island in 1949 after losing a civil war
to the Communists on the Chinese mainland. The Nationalists
government still claims to be the rightful ruler of all China and
refuses all official contact with Beijing.
   Hsiao said that also under the new policy, mainland Chinese
students studying in the United States or Europe can apply to visit
Taiwan through an unidentified private organization beginning in
August or September.
   He said Taiwan athletes may be allowed to compete on mainland
China in events sponsored by private organizations and said the
island's Olympic committee would study the possibility of sending a
team to Beijing for the 1990 Asian Games.
   The party statement also indicated reporters may soon be allowed
to travel to the mainland for news-gathering, but did not propose
relax other travel restrictions opposed by many Taiwanese.
   Although no direct trade links exist between Taiwan and China,
the Nationalists tolerate a flourishing trade through third
countries that could reach a record $2 billion this year.
   Taiwan government officials last year announced 29 items could
be imported from China indirectly but the list did not include raw
materials and agricultural products now to be tolerated.

   The Democratic candidate in a southern
Illinois congressional race in November won a special primary
Tuesday allowing him to also run to serve out the current term of
the late U.S. Rep. Melvin Price.
   Jerry F. Costello, chairman of the St. Clair County Board,
easily defeated East St. Louis Alderman Clarence Ellis Sr. in the
the 21st Congressional District's Democratic primary.
   With 429 of the 469 precincts, or 91.5 percent, reporting,
unofficial returns showed Costello with 17,040 votes to Ellis'
1,930.
   Republican Robert H. ``Bob'' Gaffner, of Greenville, who had no
opposition in the special primary, had 3,671 votes.
   The five-county district has 270,060 registered voters, but
morning thundershowers, summer distractions and a lack of interest
in the election held down turnout, officials said.
   The primary winners will face off Aug. 9 in a special general
election. The winner of that contest will finish the term of Price,
a Democrat from East St. Louis, who died April 22 of pancreatic
cancer. Price, who was 83, had already announced he would not seek
re-election after serving 44 years in Congress.
   In March, Costello and Gaffner won their respective primaries
for the right to run in the November election.
   After Price's death, Illinois law mandated a special election to
fill the office for the remainder of the term that ends in January.
The special election offers its winner a possible advantage in
November and, if elected then, seniority over 30 to 40 incoming
freshmen House members in January.
   During the current campaign, Ellis stressed his political
experience and education. He has served 13 years on the Aldermanic
Council and has masters' degrees in public administration and
education administration.
   The Costello camp promised to work for economic development, for
protection of the Social Security system and against drugs.

<HEAD>South Korea Proposes Resumption Of Family-Reunion Program</HEAD>

   South Korea called on communist North
Korea Wednesday to resume humanitarian programs to promote reunions
between some 10 million people separated from their families on
this divided peninsula.
   Kim Sang-hyup, president of South Korea's National Red Cross,
made the proposal in a telephone message to his North Korean
counterpart Son Sung Pil.
   ``In view of the ardent aspirations of separated family members,
it is our imperative task to find out the whereabouts of their
dispersed family members and relatives and help them to meet
freely,'' Kim said in the message.
   Korea was divided into the Soviet-backed north and
U.S.-supported south at the end of World War II. It is estimated
that at least 10 million people were separated from their relatives
by the division and during the Korean War in 1950-53.
   In his message, Kim proposed the two Koreas resume by the end of
the year a family-reunion program suspended since 1986.
   His appeal followed a statement Thursday by President Roh
Tae-woo who called for improved relations with North Korea,
including broad exchanges of visits between people of the two
countries.
   North Korea dismissed Roh's gestures as ``nothing new'' and
renewed its own demand for holding a ``national conference'' to
discuss, among other things, co-hosting of this summer's Olympic
Games in Seoul and the withdrawal of 42,000 U.S. military personnel
from South Korea.
   Under the North Korean plan, the conference would be attended by
about 50 government officials as well as social, political and
cultural leaders from each side.
   Kim specifically proposed that the Red Cross societies of the
two Koreas serve as an intermediary to help elderly people contact
each other.
   His office said the program could be extended to include some
one million overseas Koreans who want to locate relatives in the
two Koreas through the Geneva-based Interantional Red Cross.
   In 1985, for the first time in 40 years, the two governments
agreed to an exchange involving 151 people. The agreement also
included visits by cultural groups and 51 journalists.
   North Korea withdrew from the Red Cross contacts and economic
and parliamentary talks in 1986 to protest joint U.S.-South Korea
military exercises.

<HEAD>22nd Season Opens With Gala Concert</HEAD>

   Mostly Mozart was Mostly Marvelous.
   The 22nd season of New York City's alliterative summer musical
festival opened Tuesday night with a gala concert featuring not
one, but two, superstar soloists _ American mezzo-soprano Frederica
von Stade and Soviet emigre pianist Vladimir Feltsman.
   Both made strong impressions. Miss von Stade sang ``Parto,
parto,'' an aria from Mozart's last opera, ``La Clemenza di Tito''
and both of Cherubino's arias from ``Le Nozze di Figaro.'' She
sounded at ease in all three, her tone aristocratic, yet free and
unaffected. Her technique was flawless in the difficult runs of the
first selection, with only a hint of strain in the highest part of
her register.
   Cherubino is perhaps Miss von Stade's most famous role on stage
and she demonstrated why, communicating the restless energy of a
lovesick young boy with simple directness.
   Feltsman, who arrived in this country just last year, provided
an elegant performance of Mozart's last piano concerto, No. 27 in
B-flat major. This work, written less than a year before the
composer died, strikes a mood of serenity and triumph with little
of the turmoil and tragedy that mark the concertos preceding it.
Feltsman played with grace and clarity.
   Ironically, the least satisfying selection of the night was a
collaboration between the two _ the concert aria for soprano, piano
and orchestra ``Ch'io mi scordi di te?'' which Mozart wrote for an
18-year-old English singer with whom he had fallen in love.
   What sets this difficult aria apart is the intricate interplay
between the female voice and the piano, each seeming to address the
other in long, loving phrases. Miss von Stade and Feltsman missed
the emotional spark and too often seemed to be going through their
paces rather than communicating.
   The opening program _ which is being repeated tonight and
televised live on the Public Broadcasting Service _ was true to the
title: mostly Mozart, but with a little something else thrown in.
Conductor Gerard Schwartz led a spirited performance of Haydn's
grand and humorous Symphony No. 100, known as the ``Military''
symphony. The concert opened with the overture to Mozart's opera
``Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail.''
   It all went to show once again that Mozart, who died in poverty
in Vienna at the age of 35, left behind a unique and inexhaustible
supply of musical riches. What other composer could serve as the
mainstay of a music festival that puts on concerts for seven weeks
year after year?
   Highlights of the current season, performed in Lincoln Center's
Avery Fisher Hall, include Mozart's rarely heard early opera
``Lucia Silla,'' Haydn's ``Lord Nelson'' Mass, and a chamber
concert devoted entirely to Schubert.

<HEAD>Veep Decision Nears; Jackson Says He Wants The Job</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS new grafs 6-8 to UPDATE with Brountas comments after
meeting with Dukakis</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential nominee-to-be Michael
Dukakis pondered possible running mates on Monday, with Jesse
Jackson pressing more strongly than ever for a spot on the ticket.
Signs pointed to an announcement within a few days.
   Dukakis and his top adviser, Paul Brountas, met at Dukakis'
house Monday morning. Brountas then traveled to Washington to meet
with Jackson, who said for the first time Monday that he would take
Dukakis up on an offer to join the ticket.
   Jackson told reporters after his meeting with Brountas that ``it
is self-evident'' that he wants the job, and said he assured
Brountas he would be a loyal vice president.
   ``If it was offered to me, I would accept it,'' Jackson said. He
has said repeatedly he deserves an offer of the No. 2 spot, but up
until Monday, he had declined to say publicly what his answer would
be if that offer were extended.
   Brountas said the two had an ``excellent meeting...very
productive'' but declined to provide any details of the discussion.
Afterward, he flew back to Boston for a late-night meeting with
Dukakis.
   After a 45-minute session at Dukakis' home, with campaign
manager Susan Estrich in attendance, Brountas was asked if a
decision had been made.
   ``No comment,'' he said.
   Asked if the selection process was over, Brountas responded:
``He (Dukakis) can always ask more questions if he wants.''
   Dukakis is expected to announce his choice this week before
heading to the Democratic National Convention, which opens next
Monday. Some aides said an announcement could come as soon at
Tuesday, but others said there was still no timetable.
   Although the Massachusetts governor faces a budget crisis at
home that threatens to hurt his national candidacy, he arrived at
the Statehouse late because of the Brountas meeting. Dukakis had
planned to leave within three hours but ended up staying for nearly
seven _ still a few hours shorter than his usual workday.
   ``Have a good evening,'' was all Dukakis would say to reporters
as he left for home after a meeting with three top campaign aides,
including campaign manager Susan Estrich.
   Several campaign aides said privately that the time at home was
to be spent working to pick a running mate. ``He hasn't made up his
mind yet,'' said one Dukakis aide. ``Or if he has, he hasn't told
anybody.''
   Jackson had been scheduled to meet with Brountas last Friday,
but the meeting was postponed with Brountas saying he needed more
time to ``receive and review'' information from the Jackson
campaign. The Dukakis campaign had requested detailed personal,
financial and medical information from Jackson and other prospects.
   The civil rights leader has said he is the most qualified to
share the ticket with Dukakis and has called the others known to be
under consideration ``unknown quantities.'' They include Sens. John
Glenn of Ohio, Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, Lloyd Bentsen of Texas
and Bob Graham of Florida and Reps. Richard Gephardt of Missouri
and Lee Hamilton of Indiana.
   Dukakis aides have been aggravated by Jackson's aggressive
effort to portray himself as the logical running mate and by an
apparent effort by Jackson campaign manager Gerald Austin to
discourage the selection of Gore. Jackson said Austin's comments
were unathorized.
   During a weekend campaign swing through several Western states,
Dukakis responded tersely when asked if Jackson would have veto
power over his decision. He said the decision was his alone to make.
   Dukakis is to travel Tuesday night to Washington, where he is
scheduled to hold a series of Capitol Hill meetings on Wednesday
and also address the annual convention of the NAACP.
   When he arrives back in Boston on Wednesday night, Dukakis will
have two work days left to make good on his promise to resolve the
state's budget problems by the end of the week.
   On his desk is an $11.75 billion spending plan for fiscal 1989,
which began July 1. Legislative leaders have urged Dukakis to use
his line-item veto power to reduce that spending plan. Dukakis also
is awaiting legislative passage of a politically sensitive plan to
eliminate the $370 million deficit remaining from fiscal 1988.
   The governor is scheduled to take Saturday off and fly to
Atlanta for the convention on Sunday.

   The American League beat the National League
2-1 in another pitcher-dominated All-Star Game Tuesday night,
winning the matchup for only the fourth time in 26 games.
   American League pitchers held the NL stars to six hits.
   The NL still leads the series 37-21, with three of those losses
coming under Manager Whitey Herzog. He became the only NL manager
to lose three times.
   Oakland's Terry Steinbach, who has only a .217 batting average,
homered in the third inning off Dwight Gooden and hit a
bases-loaded sacrifice fly to the warning track in the fourth
against Bob Knepper. Steinbach, one of 30 first-time All-Stars, was
named the game's most valuable player.
   AL pitcher Frank Viola set down the only six hitters he faced
for the victory and Dennis Eckersley, leading the majors with 26
saves, got the final three batters.
   A crowd of 55,837 watched the game, including Vice President
George Bush, who threw out the first ball.

   Mercy killing is common in many Chinese
hospitals, an official report said today.
   The China Daily said that one Shanghai hospital reported 28
percent of the 563 deaths in its medical, surgical and gynecology
departments in the past three years were the result of euthanasia.
   Incurably ill patients were allowed to die at the request of
relatives who wanted to end the patients' suffering, it said.
   The report said most cases of euthanasia in Chinese hospitals
were ``passive,'' meaning the withholding of life-preserving
treatment to terminally ill patients.
   Mercy killing is not a sanctioned medical practice in China, but
recent polls have shown substantial popular acceptance.
   The People's Daily reported last April that a survey of 283
retired people in Shanghai found more than half favored euthanasia
for incurably ill patients.

   Six youths were gored seriously and at
least 19 others suffered minor injuries in the seventh and most
dangerous running of the bulls at the San Fermin Festival.
   The six bulls and a group of lead steers ran the half-mile
stretch from the corrals to the bull ring in less than eight
minutes Tuesday, with more than 1,000 youths running ahead.
   The running took a dangerous turn when one bull stopped and
began attacking several youths who had taken refuge in doorways and
against the wooden planks lining the route.
   Every afternoon, the bulls are killed in professional
bullfights. The festival began last Wednesday and is to continue
through Thursday.
   Held continously since 1591, the festival gained fame when
Ernest Hemingway used it as a setting for his 1926 novel, ``The Sun
Also Rises.''
   Since 1591, bulls have gored 52 people to death, 12 since 1924,
according to official records.

   Rock 'n' roll stars perform in
his honor. Archbishop Desmond Tutu calls him ``my leader.''
Publishing his picture is illegal in South Africa, but even
toddlers chant his name.
   Nelson Mandela, who turns 70 on Monday, is arguably the world's
most influential prisoner. Although jailed since 1962, he is the
most admired leader among South African blacks, the embodiment of
their quest for political freedom.
   His birthday, celebrated by protest marches and rock concerts
overseas, has reminded the government of the legions of people
worldwide who want him released. Blacks spanning South Africa's
ideological spectrum, as well as many whites, say no political
breakthrough can occur while Mandela is behind bars.
   ``Nothing the South African government can do will gain
credibility while it treats Dr. Mandela as a dangerous enemy,''
Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said in a recent speech. ``Black
South Africa will not rest until he is free.''
   Buthelezi is a bitter foe of the African National Congress, the
outlawed guerrilla movement Mandela led from underground prior to
his imprisonment. But Buthelezi, like other blacks who oppose the
ANC's strategy of violence, sets Mandela apart and discusses him
with deep respect.
   President P.W. Botha's government has considered the idea of
freeing Mandela, and several times in recent years there were
flurries of speculation that his freedom was imminent. One such
period came last November when authorities freed Govan Mbeki, one
of seven ANC leaders sentenced along with Mandela to life prison
terms in 1964 for plotting a sabotage campaign aimed at
overthrowing white-minority rule.
   The speculation was swiftly dampened when police imposed severe
restrictions on Mbeki. Since then, government officials have
indicated Mandela's release is unlikely unless he publicly
renounces violence _ a condition he rejects unless the ANC is made
legal and apartheid dismantled.
   When convicted for sabotage, Mandela already had served two
years in prison, having received a five-year sentence in 1962 for
incitement and leaving the country illegally.
   He spent the first 18 years of his life sentence on Robben
Island in Cape Town's Table Bay. He was transferred in 1982 to
Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town, where he is reported in good
physical and mental health.
   Mandela reads uncensored newspapers and is expected to earn an
advanced law degree later this year through correspondence courses.
He was a practicing lawyer before he went underground and has been
awarded honorary doctorates from various universities during his
imprisonment.
   He reportedly has a spacious cell with access to a rooftop
garden.
   The government has given permission to Mandela's family to have
a six-hour reunion with him Monday at Pollsmoor, by far the longest
such meeting since he was jailed.
   Mandela's wife, Winnie, has asked that the birthday be observed
``as a day of peace, in line with the peaceful struggle we have
always tried to maintain.''
   She has not commented publicly about the recent series of
bombings of civilian targets in South Africa _ attacks South
African police officials blame on the ANC.
   Dr. Nthato Motlana, an anti-apartheid activist from Soweto and
an ANC member before it was outlawed in 1960, said Mandela seeks to
avoid civilian casualties.
   He resorted to a strategy of sabotage in 1961 ``because all
other avenues were exhausted,'' Motlana said. ``He is the one man
who, assuming he is willing, could lead us out of this mess.''
   Buthelezi also views Mandela as a potential peacemaker, as
perhaps the only person capable of ending a bloody power struggle
in Natal province between militant ANC supporters and more
conservative blacks who follow Buthelezi.
   ``I believe he (Mandela) would come out of jail to thump anybody
... who set black brother against black brother on the eve of a
final victory over apartheid,'' Buthelezi said.
   Some South Africans believe Mandela causes more trouble for the
government in jail than he would if freed. Some warn of a violent
black backlash if he dies in prison.
   The largest daily newspaper, The Star, recently urged Mandela's
release on pragmatic grounds. It said in an editorial:
   ``Should Mandela die in prison, he will be accorded universal
political canonization and Pretoria will attract even more censure.
Once he is free, the Mandela myth would be cut down to size''
   The world hears from Mandela himself primarily through past
statements which relatives and colleagues continue to quote.
   In one such statement in 1985, he rejected Botha's offer of
conditional release.
   ``I cannot and will not give any undertaking at a time when I
and you the people are not free,'' he said in a statement read by
his youngest daughter, Zinzi. ``Your freedom and mine cannot be
separated. I shall return.''

UPDATE with Brountas holding late-night meeting with Dukakis</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis huddled at home with his closest adviser Monday
as time grew short to pick a Democratic vice presidential running
mate. Jesse Jackson openly sought the nomination widely expected to
go elsewhere, saying ``If it was offered to me I would accept it.''
   Vice President George Bush said he might consider Bob Dole or
another former Republican rival as his partner when he picks a
running mate next month.
   Dukakis met with Paul Brountas and then sent his longtime
confidant to Washington to meet with Jackson, runner-up in the
primaries and widely regarded as unlikely to receive an offer to
join the ticket.
   Jackson, one of seven known candidates for the vice presidential
nomination, termed the session ``an oral interview and@or exam'' on
the topic. He said he gave Brountas his ``candid view as to the
office of vice president ... and what I thought my qualifications
might be.''
   He said it was ``self-evident'' he would like to be vice
president.
   But more likely candidates were Sens. Bob Graham of Florida,
Lloyd Bentsen of Texas; John Glenn of Ohio; Albert Gore Jr. of
Tennessee and Reps. Richard Gephardt of Missouri and Lee Hamilton
of Indiana.
   The increasingly delicate maneuvering came as a CBS News-New
York Times poll found the Massachusetts governor holding a 47
percent to 39 percent lead over Bush in a nationwide survey
conducted last week.
   Democratic chairman Paul Kirk preached the gospel of party unity
at a news conference in Atlanta one week before the party
nominating convention opens. He said any disagreements over the
party's bare-bones platform ``are gradually being worked out''
between the Dukakis and Jackson forces.
   ``I don't expect there will be any so-called floor fights over
the platform,'' he said.
   Jackson adviser Ron Brown wasn't ready to go that far, although
he said the two sides are continuing to negotiate in an attempt to
work out remaining differences. ``There might be some very serious
issues of principle that go to the floor of the convention,'' he
said in Atlanta. Jackson supports calls for higher taxes on the
wealthy and a five-year freeze in military spending; Dukakis
opposes both.
   The convention hall itself was a hardhat zone. The television
network skyboxes were in place, but painters, carpenters and
electricians all worked to ready the Omni for the invasion of
Democrats, reporters and political junkies that will fill every
available inch of space.
   Dukakis stayed mum on the subject on every Democrat's mind _ his
choice of a political partner for the fall campaign. ``Have a good
evening,'' was all he said to reporters as he left his statehouse
office at the end of the day.
   But the signs pointed to a decision soon, and the calendar
dictated one. An announcement was expected this week, at least in
part to allow Dukakis and Jackson supporters time to absorb the
decision before their arrival in Atlanta.
   The governor spent part of the day at his statehouse office
working on a Massachusetts budget crunch, and the balance of the
day at home. His aides said Dukakis was mulling his choices. He met
during the morning with Brountas, and the two had a second,
late-night session after Brountas returned from Washington.
Afterward, Brountas refused to say whether a running mate had been
picked.
   ``He hasn't made up his mind yet,'' said one Dukakis aide,
speaking on condition he not be identified by name. ``Or if he has,
he hasn't told anybody.''
   Brountas flew to Washington to meet with Jackson, regarded as
too liberal and too controversial to get Dukakis' nod.
   He joked about the subject at one point, saying, ``So far,
Dukakis has not accepted my offer and I have not refused his.''
   But later, Jackson turned serious.
   ``If I am not on the team, then the governor must determine who
the team members are and what role they will play,'' Jackson said
before the session began.
   He added, ``Certainly I am convinced that we have the challenge
and the obligation to work together to win for the fall. But beyond
that we must establish a partnership of equity and shared
responsibility.''
   Bush took a jab at Dukakis in a speech to farm editors and
broadcasters that he billed as non-partisan. ``I am not the one who
feels that the problems of agricultural America can be solved by
planting more Belgian endive,'' he said, poking fun at an off-hand
comment Dukakis made in Iowa last year.
   Bush, who is waiting for Dukakis to pick a running mate before
he does, offered praise of one-time primary foe Bob Dole and said
he doesn't rule out any of the men who ran against him for the
Republican nomination.
   ``The fact that you ran against somebody certainly in my view
would not preclude consideration of that person,'' the vice
president told a meeting of agricultural editors, writers and
broadcasters in Washington.
   ``I will say this about Bob Dole _ he and I went head on head.
So did Pat Robertson and Al Haig and Pete du Pont and Jack Kemp.
... My party has never been more unified going into a Republican
convention than we are right now, thanks to the way Bob Dole and
the others have been conducting themselves and their sense of
advocacy.''
   The vice president said he would solicit advice from a variety
of Republican lawmakers and GOP National Committee members, and
then ``make a very personal decision.''
   But, he said, ``I just don't want to start going through long
lists or short lists because believe me, at this juncture, we don't
have them.''
   Dukakis' eight-point lead in the CBS-New York Times poll
represented a small drop from a 10-point edge in a similar survey
in May. In addition, 28 percent of those polled expressed a
favorable view of Dukakis, down from 38 percent in May. Twenty-one
percent expressed an unfavorable view, up from 14 percent.
   Bush's favorable rating was 26 percent, down from 33 percent,
and his unfavorable rating was 31 percent, about the same as its 35
percent in May.

<HEAD>Giuliani Urges More Liability For Brokerage Firms</HEAD>

   One of the best ways to get brokerage firms to
combat insider trading is to make them pay when one of their
employees gets caught, says the top federal prosecutor of
securities law violations.
   ``It's the only way we're going to get institutions to start
taking responsibility for individual behavior,'' Rudolph W.
Giuliani, U.S. attorney in Manhattan, told a House panel on Monday.
   However, Giuliani and Securities and Exchange Commission
Chairman David S. Ruder both cautioned that the law should exempt
firms and supervisors that make a good-faith effort to stop their
employees from using non-public information to profit from trading
in securities.
   ``All of us are certainly sensitive to the fact that whenever
anyone runs any institution, large or small, they can be victimized
by the criminal activities of others,'' said Giuliani, whose office
has prosecuted a string of prominent Wall Street insider trading
cases during the last two years.
   Meanwhile, Ruder said his agency is investigating the role of
the firm that employed Stephen Wang Jr., accused two weeks ago in
the second-biggest insider trading case ever handled by the SEC.
   Wang, a 24-year-old Morgan Stanley & Co. analyst, is accused of
passing non-public information to Fred C. Lee, a Hong Kong
businessman. The $19 million in illegal profits they allegedly
reaped is second only to the Ivan Boesky case.
   ``We will be looking ... at whether Morgan Stanley's supervisory
procedures were adequate and whether Morgan Stanley bears any
fault,'' Ruder told reporters outside the hearing room.
   ``If they were directly responsible for the activity ... we
might consider including them as one of the parties to the action,
but I don't mean for a minute to suggest that we have any
indication of that at all,'' he said.
   Ruder and Giuliani said a draft bill offered by Rep. Edward J.
Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce finance
subcommittee, should more carefully spell out when brokerage firms
would be subject to fines for the violations of their employees.
   John W. Bachmann, chairman of the Securities Industry
Association, the trade group representing brokerages, said firms
and supervisors should be required to have policies designed to
prevent insider trading. But he said they should be held liable
only when they actively aided a violation.
   Bachmann also sought to limit a provision that would allow the
SEC to pay bounties of up to 10 percent of any insider-trading
penalty to informers who tip the agency off to a violation. He said
participants in an insider trading scheme should not be allowed to
receive bounties.
   Ruder also expressed reservations, saying juries may not believe
witnesses who are paid to testify.
   However, Giuliani said the Internal Revenue Service has used
bounties effectively to prosecute tax cheats. Although tipsters are
sometimes peripherally involved in illegalities, it is worth paying
a reward when it results in a windfall for federal coffers, he said.
   ``It's the only way in which you are going to bring this
information forward,'' he said.
   Markey said he intends to pass the bill out of his subcommittee
in time for congressional action this year.
   Other provisions increase the fines for insider trading, create
a basis for private investors to sue inside traders and enhance the
SEC's power to cooperate in investigations with foreign securities
agencies.

   With hot water going for nearly $27 a gallon and
potted plants renting for $79.50, there is money to be made at next
week's Democratic National Convention.
   The days when delegates pulled into town with a $10 bill and a
clean shirt and left without changing either are history.
   The 35,000 visitors for the July 18-21 event are expected to
leave about $30 million in Atlanta. But some local plans to partake
of the windfall have gone awry.
   An employee of an Atlanta office furniture and equipment rental
firm told one caller his company and many others like it had raised
prices 30 to 40 percent in anticipation of the convention rush.
   So many news organizations and some Democratic National
Committee groups flocked to a Detroit-area firm willing to deliver,
install, maintain and remove typewriters, computers, copiers,
telefax machines and office furniture at roughly half the going
Atlanta cost.
   For example, water coolers were quoted locally at $30 a day. The
Detroit firm provides them at $30 a month.
   Some Atlanta companies are renting typing tables at $50 each,
waste baskets for up to $27 and chairs for as much as $40.
   Convention Florist Service Int'l. Inc. lists the rental price on
7-foot green plant at $79.50. Local florists checked by telephone
offered to sell similar plants outright for from $45 to $65.
   Hotels are also looking at a boom, with rooms for delegates,
reporters, VIPs, fund-raisers, lobbyists, protesters and the
curious at a premium.
   A prospectus for a major textile convention coming to Atlanta in
September lists a single room at the Atlanta Hilton at $102. A
reservations clerk quoted a rate of $135 for the Democratic
convention.
   A spot check found some hotels charging higher rates although
some quoted rates at or below the rate being charged at the
September textile convention.
   Many of the receptions, news conferences and hospitality rooms
scheduled for the convention will be held at the Georgia World
Congress Center, home base for most of the 12,000 news media
representatives plus the party faithful who cannot fit into the
convention hall.
   MGR Inc., the food service contractor for all events there, will
cater about 950 convention functions over four days, from small
hospitality suites to a windup ``victory party'' for 30,000.
   MGR president Phillip Noyes said the company is hiring about 500
extra employees to handle the rush. However, the prices have been
in effect for a year.
   ``We aren't the cheapest in the country,'' he acknowledged. ``We
provide a highly specialized service and people pay for that. Our
business isn't any different. People want a product that's iced
down, chilled and ready, and all that goes with it.''
   Last year a poll of 500 trade shows and conventions picked MGR
as the best convention catering firm in the country.
   MGR will provide soft drinks at about $43 a case. Most meals
will be served buffet-style with lunch at $14.50 and dinner at
$18.50.
   Coffee, or hot water to make tea or instant coffee, is about $27
a gallon after tax and a 17 percent service charge are added. Fruit
juice will be about $29 a gallon. Convention tenants are barred
from having their own coffee makers.
   ``They're charging $165 for 100 little pieces of chicken.
Everybody is complaining,'' said Jesse Jackson aide Yolanda
Carroway.
   ``Prices have not been raised at all,'' said Tim Sterns, who
oversees convention catering for the Democratic National Committee.
He said DNC surveys showed the prices to be lower than those at
many downtown hotels.
   ``They have been very accommodating,'' he said when asked about
the price of MGR's coffee service. ``They put in a program where
the initial service is $50 and they provide a coffee maker. Each
day they will deliver supplies at a lower rate for people who want
to make their own coffee. They have made some concessions in that
way.''
   Delegates may get a break, however, if they come down with
toothaches. An Atlanta dentist, Edward J. Mills, is offering free
emergency dental service to delegates during the convention.

   Defying terminal cancer,
President Jose Napoleon Duarte returned from Washington to begin
catching up on official business after six weeks' absence.
   ``I am here now to reassume the presidency, in order to continue
working for what I most love: democracy,'' the 62-year-old Duarte
said upon arriving Monday from the U.S. capital, where he underwent
diagnosis and treatment beginning May 31.
   ``I certainly am not cured. But I am strong. I have the capacity
and the strength to carry out both the medical requisites my
disease demands and my work for the people,'' said Duarte, the
Western Hemisphere' staunchest U.S. ally.
   Duarte, whose five-year term ends June 1, 1989, was leaner than
when he left and his face was somewhat drawn.
   But his step was firm and his embrace appeared strong as he
greeted Rodolfo Castillo Claramount, the vice president and acting
chief executive, and other officials on the tarmac of Ilopango
Airport outside the capital.
   After a brief airport ceremony, he was driven to the
presidential residence to rest. The chemotherapy Duarte is
undergoing for liver cancer has debilitated him somewhat, but he
vowed the illness would not keep him down.
   Doctors have given him between six and 18 months to live.
   Duarte promised to continue working with the military against
leftist guerrillas ``in order to bring peace to my people ... in
that way I will make it to the first of June and hand power over to
the one who is elected by the people.''
   Duarte's governing Christian Democratic Party is in the deepest
crisis of its 28-year history. Each of two bitterly feuding
factions has nominated a presidential candidate.
   The right-wing opposition won municipal and legislative
elections in March. That victory, along with the Christian
Democrats' internal problems, have created the impression that the
right-wing Republican Nationalist Alliance could win the March 1989
presidential election.
   Castillo told a news conference last week that Duarte's work
routine will be established ``according to the evolution of his
disease.''
   The president is to return to Walter Reed Medical Center in
Washington next month for at least one more massive chemotherapy
application. Salvadoran officials have said subsequent treatment
could be carried out in El Salvador.

   Pop star Michael Jackson was greeted by 800
screaming fans as he arrived at Heathrow Airport to begin his first
British tour.
   As Jackson, 29, was whisked through customs Monday, fans waving
banners saying ``We Love You Michael'' and ``Welcome To London''
strained for a glimpse of the man they had awaited for since early
morning.
   Jackson appeared briefly on a viewing platform, wearing dark
glasses and a ``Sgt. Pepper'' suit in the style of the Beatles.
   He waved back at his fans and said, ``This welcome is truly
wonderful, I love the English people,'' before six security guards
escorted him away.
   Jackson opens his tour Thursday with a concert at London's
Wembley Stadium. He will perform Saturday at a charity concert to
be attended by Prince Charles and his wife, Diana.
   Later this month, Jackson's ``Bad Tour'' _ named for his album
``Bad'' _ will continue in Ireland and Wales before returning to
London in August.

   Berle was host of TV's first hit show, ``Texaco Star Theater.''
His vaudevillian antics endeared him to a generation of Americans
and earned him the title ``Mr. Television.''
   Berle opens at Caesar's Palace in Atlantic City, N.J., on Aug. 9
with Danny Thomas and Sid Caesar. He then has performances
scheduled in Las Vegas, Nev., beginning Aug. 24.
   ``He's really 80 years young and his contribution to the world

Town,'' said he wants to make a weekly TV series based on the
famous home for boys.
   Rooney, who played the tough teen-ager Whitey James in the 1938

possibility of creating the TV series.
   ``Yours truly is going to be Father Whitey Marsh, the head of
Boys Town,'' he said Monday.
   Rooney appeared Monday with Bobs Watson, who was 7 years old
when he played little Pee Wee in the movie starring Spencer Tracy
as Father Flanagan, founder of Boys Town. Rooney was 18 when the
movie was made.
   Watson, who became a United Methodist minister 25 years ago and
lives in Southern California, said making the movie had a big
impact on his life.
   ``Father Flanagan was one of those men who touched my life
deeply and was one of the reasons why I went into the ministry,''

<HEAD>Reagan Promises To Consider Lawmakers' Opposition To Seabrook
Order</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan has promised to weigh
opposition to a proposed executive order that could help license
the Seabrook, N.H., nuclear power plant by circumventing the
objections of Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis.
   Lawmakers from the all-Republican New Hampshire congressional
delegation, upset over the proposed federal intervention, said they
received the pledge Monday after a White House briefing with Reagan.
   ``We found the president very positive, very sympathetic, very
understanding,'' said Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H. ``It was clear to
all of us that the president was going to very actively consider
our request that this order never be published.''
   Rudman and Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., expressed optimism that
the president may reject the proposal.
   ``I am very hopeful that this visit has an effect on the
president in convincing him that the process was working (and) the
federal government need not become involved at this time,'' Rudman
told reporters outside the White House.
   Humphrey added, ``The president didn't say yes or no, but I came
away more encouraged about our prospects of blocking this order
than frankly I had expected to.''
   But Rep. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., who said before the briefing that
he thought it would be extremely difficult to derail the proposal,
said afterwards that he felt no more optimistic about the
lawmakers' chances.
   ``He gave us no reading at all as to what his decision would
be,'' said Gregg, noting that Reagan reiterated his strong support
for atomic power and expressed concern over state governments'
ability to block reactor licenses.
   ``The president has not made a decision,'' said Rep. Robert
Smith, R-N.H. ``He will weigh our evidence and our advice. That's
the best we can hope for at this time.''
   The four lawmakers, loyal and long-time allies of the Reagan
administration, have expressed support for plant licensing as long
as federal regulators determine that the plant and evacuation plan
are safe.
   Licensing for the Seabrook reactor has been stalled largely by
the refusal of Dukakis to submit evacuation plans for the six
Massachusetts communities that fall within the plant's 10-mile
emergency zone.
   The proposed executive order would give the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, which has served a strictly advisory role in
atomic safety issues, the power to design and implement evacuation
plans when local governments refuse to do so.
   The four were infuriated last month when they learned of the
proposal through plant opponents, who discovered a draft and leaked
it to reporters.
   Reagan told the delegation that he had not seen any draft of the
proposal, which sources said was initiated by the Energy
Department, pushed by four senators and approved unanimously by the
president's Domestic Policy Council.
   Dukakis and other plant opponents have said it is impossible to
evacuate the area quickly and safely because of narrow rural roads
and a large summertime population.

   State troopers patrolled city streets Monday
to make up for an apparent sick-out by more than 300 officers upset
over low wages and the lack of a labor contract. The job action
ended at late evening.
   Police Chief Warren Woodfork said city streets were probably
safer than usual because of the 60 troopers in the city. There were
143 officers and troopers on patrol, compared with a usual 83,
police said.
   Officers began straggling back to work for the start of their
late-evening shift, said police department spokesman John Bryson.
``They have returned to work. We're back up to normal strength,''
he said.
   Woodfork said his department could continue to maintain security
in the city of 500,000 even if police union members carry out a
threat to stop work during next month's Republican National
Convention.
   About 130 troopers already are scheduled to be in New Orleans
next month during the GOP convention.
   The sick-out began Sunday night and Woodfork said he didn't know
how long it would last, although he heard it was to end Monday
night.
   Leaders of the Police Association of New Orleans have long been
pressuring Mayor Sidney Barthelemy to enter the city's first
collective bargaining agreement with the union. The union claims a
membership of about 900 of the 1,100-member police force.
   Barthelemy, who was out of town Monday and unavailable for
comment, has refused to recognize PANO as a collective bargaining
group.
   Union President Ron Cannatella did not return telephone calls
and there was no word from the union on whether it had called for
the sick-out.
   Woodfork said he had no immediate plans to discipline officers
who called in sick Sunday or Monday.
   ``I would just ask the officers who are out sick to search their
consciences. Don't hold the city of New Orleans hostage,'' he said.

<HEAD>1988: Last of the Prime-Time Convention Coverage?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In 1984, there was great hand-wringing over the
networks' decision to drop gavel-to-gavel coverage of the national
conventions in favor of roughly two hours of live prime-time
coverage a night.
   In 1988, the question that's starting to be asked is whether two
hours of prime-time coverage a night is too much.
   Former NBC News President Reuven Frank, who has attended seven
conventions as a network producer, saw the end of gavel-to-gavel
coverage and expects this year to watch the last prime-time
coverage.
   ``Conventions are now being held by the two major parties only
because there's television,'' Frank said. ``That's the only
justification for the convention at all. There is no journalistic
reason for our being there. I think we ought to be there; I don't
think we ought to carry it live.
   ``There's nothing going to happen that you don't know now
sitting here. But we don't know how to stop. It's like `The Old Man
and the Sea.'''
   Next week, when the Democrats meet in Atlanta, they are certain
to nominate Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis. The only major
questions remaining are who his running mate will be and what Jesse
Jackson, the runner-up, will do or say.
   Media-wise political parties know that prime-time bickering
turns off voters, so conventions have become little more than
prime-time commercials. A one-time major network event, the
conventions are becoming a made-for-cable show.
   Complete coverage will be available on C-SPAN and the Cable News
Network, a trend that will no doubt allow the three major networks
to say by 1992 that cable TV provides sufficient coverage to meet
the public need and the networks no longer need devote live prime
time to the proceedings. Indeed, they are already beginning to say
that.
   ``Our responsibility as a news organization has changed
somewhat,'' said NBC producer Anne Binford. ``In the past, we felt
we had to provide coverage of the entire convention, but now, with
cable and C-SPAN and CNN, the viewers can watch the coverage from
many different sources. We're now trying to bring the audience a
condensed version of the important events of the night.''
   All three networks say their coverage plans are flexible,
depending on events. But the intention is to go on the air from
9-11 p.m. EDT each of the four nights. CBS plans to start at 8 p.m.
on Thursday.
   C-SPAN will carry each session of the convention live, in its
entirety, without commentary or interviews.
   CNN plans to carry convention updates throughout the day, the
convention session in its entirety, followed by a half-hour wrapup,
then ``Crossfire'' and ``Inside Politics '88.'' The most devout
political junkies can even catch convention highlights from 4-6 a.m.
   Jeff Gralnick, ABC's executive producer of special broadcasts,
wishes the networks could justify such extensive coverage.
   ``I think there's a hell of a vibrant political story at the
conventions,'' he said. ``I'm a political junkie, and I just find
what the Democrats are doing and later the Republicans a
fascinating political dynamic.''
   But he concedes the conventions ``are not a mass-audience
program.''
   ``For the sake of the union, I wish they were, but if you look
at the number of people who choose to vote out of the universe of
people who can vote, you begin to get an answer of why people don't
watch political conventions. If they don't care to vote, they
certainly aren't going to watch the end product of the voting.''
   CNN stands to become the star of the Democrats' convention. It
has anchor power in Mary Alice Williams and Bernard Shaw, and with
the networks paring down their staffs for budgetary considerations,
the cable network is in their league. CNN will have 275 staffers
compared to the 300-350 each for the bigger networks. In addition,
CNN is based in Atlanta and has a home-field advantage.
   The three networks are taking 25-50 percent fewer staffers to
this year's conventions than they did in 1984.
   ``I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a matter of budget, but more
it's a matter of each time you do one of these things, you learn
how to do them a little more efficiently,'' said Gralnick.
   ``It's new times,'' said Binford. ``I think with the new
technology, we're able to cover it just as efficiently.''
   Frank, himself an innovator of much of the present-day
convention coverage, such as anchor booths overlooking the
convention floor, agrees that the networks have learned a lot.
   But, he adds, ``now that we know how to cover it, there's
nothing to cover.''

^Research Group Calls For Fuel, Gas-Guzzler Taxes</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States should raise gasoline taxes
by 50 cents a gallon, require cars to get 45 miles per gallon and
boost the gas-guzzler tax to raise money for rebates to buyers of
fuel-efficient cars, an organization of environmentalists,
scientists and business executives said today.
   Those were central measures in a program outlined by the
American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy that would set a
national goal of maintaining momentum in improving energy
efficiency for the rest of the century.
   ``Energy efficiency does not require sacrifice,'' the group
argued in its report. ``We do not advocate saving energy as an end
in itself. It makes sense only when saving energy costs less than
providing energy, including environmental damage and security risks
in the comparison.''
   Environmental risks of inefficiency are severe, the group said.
Man-made gases, notably carbon dioxide produced by fossil fuels,
threaten to warm the earth by as much as eight degrees Fahrenheit
in the next century, raising sea levels and drastically changing
patterns of rainfall and drought _ a process some scientists say is
under way.
   Increasing the 9-cent-per-gallon federal gasoline tax by 10
cents annually for five years _ three years if crude oil prices
double _ would yield $40 billion to $60 billion a year.
   Such a tax would help make sure ``consumers are given a price
signal that better reflects the real cost of the resource and
encourages conservation.'' Some money could be rebated to the poor
through income tax provisions.
   Cars, now required to get 26 mpg, should get 45 mpg by 2000.
``It need not be so'' that the standards would mean less safety
from lighter weight if cars are carefully designed, the group said.
   Cars twice as efficient as current models would cost $200 to
$800 more, the group estimated. The increase would be recouped over
the life of the car through lower cost of operation.
   A stiffer ``gas-guzzler'' tax, which can reach more than $2,000
now but generally applies to only a few luxury cars like Jaguar,
would discourage production of highly inefficient cars and provide
funds _ more than $1.1 billion a year in 1994 _ to encourage
purchase of ``gas sippers.''
   The rebate could be ``on the order of $1,000'' for models with
mileage 50 percent better than today's best _ implying rebates for
cars getting about 75 mpg.
   Energy used per dollar of economic activity declined at a rate
of about 2.7 percent per year from 1976 through 1986, and was still
declining at a 2.5 percent per year during the economic recovery of
1983 through 1986.
   The 1986 oil price collapse discouraged further gains, and the
decline was only 0.5 percent in 1987. The Energy Department says it
expects gains of about 0.9 percent a year for the rest of the
century.
   A reasonable international goal would be annual reductions of 2
percent, and ``We suggest that the United States set an example by
pursuing a goal of at least 2.5 percent per year'' until 2000, the
group said.

   Eighty-three people have died and another 1,500
have been hospitalized in a heat wave that has smothered the
eastern Chinese city of Nanking for 10 days, the official Xinhua
News Agency reported.
   The report quoted Zhu Qingxue, director of the city public
health bureau, as saying four-fifths of those who died were over
age 60.
   It said temperatures in the city have hovered around 102 degrees
in the third-hottest heat spell since 1905. On Monday, the high
reached 100 degrees in the city of 3 million.
   Roads have been melting, factories have been told to cut back on
electricity consumption and hospitals have been asked to set up
rescue centers, Xinhua said.
   It said people have been helping policemen to keep cool by
giving them cold water and cold towels and have been crowding into
department stores and cinemas, among the few places in the city
with air conditioning.
   Nanking, located on the Yangtze River, is known as one of the
``furnaces'' of China because of its hot summers.

<HEAD>NAACP Honors Medgar Evers 25 Years After His Murder</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CRISPIN Y. CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Promoting the memory and ideals of civil
rights leaders such as Medgar Evers may help black youth steer
clear of crime and drugs, says Evers' widow, Myrlie.
   ``It is so important that we remember our leaders who have
passed and those who are with us now, and that our young people
know who they are and the contributions that they have made,'' Mrs.
Evers said upon acceptance of the NAACP's first Chairman Civil
Rights Leadership Award in behalf of her husband.
   ``In so knowing they will have something to aspire to,'' she
said, ``they will not as readily go into black on black crime, or
into drugs. But there will be a sense of well-being, a sense of
going forward. That is what Medgar stood for.''
   `` I am so grateful that Medger is being remembered by the
organization that he loved so much and the organization that no one
could take him away from,'' Mrs. Evers told the 79th annual
convention of the National Association For the Advancement of
Colored People.
   Evers, who led the fight against segregation as the NAACP's
Mississippi state field secretary from 1954 to 1963, received
national attention as the man who counseled James Meredith through
his successful bid to enter the University of Mississippi in 1962.
   Mrs. Evers, currently the Los Angeles city commissioner of
public works, told the Associated Press about the day her husband
was gunned-down in front of their home in Jackson.
   ``I was in the kitchen with the children, as he entered the
driveway, the children said `there's Daddy's,' as he opened the car
door the shot rang out. The children fell to the floor _ as he had
taught them _ and I bolted for the door ... thinking `Oh God, don't
let him be hit.' ''
   Evers had been fatally wounded with a shot from a high powered
rifle, ``the kind they used to kill large animals like deer,'' she
said. A member of the White Citizens Council was charged and tried
twice by an all-white jury which was unable to reach a verdict.
   Mrs. Evers admitted she ``always felt he never got the
recognition for the work he had done and I wanted so badly for
people to know about him and his work. ... and his organization,
the NAACP is doing that.''
   ``Keeping his memory alive was something he and I had discussed
before his death,'' she said. ``We both knew that something was
coming and tried to prepare ourselves and each other for the
inevitable. And the last two weeks of his life we stopped denying
(that) something would not happen, (something) that we knew was
going to happen.
   ``He told me `Myrlie, don't worry about people remembering me _
at some point in history my deeds will speak for themselves.'
   ``Once I told him he wasn't getting enough publicity, and he
said `I don't want publicity. I'm in it for the people _ it doesn't
make any difference to me.' ''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Berlin Opera will present two performances
of Richard Wagner's sprawling opera masterpiece ``Der Ring des
Nibelungen'' in an exclusive American engagement at the Kennedy
Center next June, center officials announced today.
   The four-opera ``Ring'' cycle, which consists of nearly 15 hours
of music, will be performed twice in the Kennedy Center Opera
House, June 2-18, to mark the 40th anniversary of the founding of
the West German republic.
   West Berlin's leading opera company will present the innovative
1985 staging of the ``Ring'' cycles by general director Gotz
Friedrich, which features a ``time tunnel'' extending the full
depth of the stage.
   Each cycle includes the operas ``Das Rheingold,'' ``Die
Walkure,'' ``Siegfried'' and ``Gotterdammerung'' and will be
performed over four days and last almost 18 hours, including
intermissions and a dinner break.
   The Berlin Opera's first Washington appearance since 1976 is
being underwritten by the Bonn government.
   Marta Istomin, artistic director of the Kennedy Center, said
audiences ``will be able to see and hear one of the central
masterpieces of German art performed by a great German opera
company on a historic occasion.''
   Friedrich said his company will be paying tribute to ``the
strong ties that exist between West Berlin and the U.S.A.'' and
expressing ``the gratitude of the citizens of West Berlin to the
American people.''

   The three major networks plan to carry live
coverage of the Democratic National Convention for approximately
two hours of prime time each night, Monday through Thursday.
   All three networks plan coverage from 9-11 p.m. EDT each night.
CBS will start at 8 p.m. on Thursday.
   ABC's coverage will be anchored by Peter Jennings with
commentary by David Brinkley. ``World News Tonight'' and ``Good
Morning America'' will originate from Atlanta during the
convention. ``Nightline'' will stay home in Washington, but will
include reports on the convention as news merits.
   Walter Cronkite, who is under contract negotiations with CBS,
nevertheless returns for his 19th convention serving as network
commentator. Dan Rather will anchor the convention coverage. ``CBS
Evening News'' will originate from Atlanta, as will ``CBS This
Morning.''
   NBC's Tom Brokaw will anchor his network's coverage with John
Chancellor providing commentary. ``NBC Nightly News'' and the
``Today'' show will originate from Atlanta.
   C-SPAN will carry each session of the convention live without
commentary each night.
   Cable News Network will have updates throughout the day, then
carry complete live coverage of the convention session each night,
followed by a half-hour wrapup, then ``Crossfire'' and ``Inside
Politics '88.'' Convention highlights will be shown 4-6 a.m. EDT.
   PBS' ``MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour'' will also report from the
convention.
   In the battle of the political columnist-commentators, ABC
landed columnists George F. Will and Tom Wicker. CBS snagged Kevin
Phillips and Roger Rosenblatt.
   CNN's lineup of experts include columnists Patrick Buchanan, Tom
Braden, Rowland Evans, Mark Green and Robert Novak. PBS has U.S.
News & World Report Editor David Gergen and Washington Post
columnist Mark Shields.
   NBC says it is depending on its own Chancellor, Brokaw and
political reporter Ken Bode, though political consultants Bob
Squier and John Sears will offer commentary on ``Today.''

   Israeli troops killed two Palestinians and
wounded at least 13 in clashes with stone-throwers in the West
Bank, hospital officials said. It was the highest one-day casualty
toll in nearly a month.
   After a weeklong closure, the military government reopened
Palestinian schools in the occupied West Bank on Monday.
   But later, it ordered six schools shut through the end of the
school year, which will be in August this year because of earlier
closings.
   Israeli officials have called the 800 schools in the West Bank
flashpoints of violence.
   In Arab east Jerusalem, Palestinians on Monday stoned four
Israeli buses and firebombed a fifth, causing minor damage. Police
said an Arab woman was struck by a stone, and two Arabs were
arrested.
   A top Israeli official denied charges by ABC News that Israeli
security agents impersonated ABC News personnel in a ploy to
deceive and arrest a West Bank Arab.
   Also Monday, the Supreme Court rejected requests by Time
magazine and the Reuters news agency that it order the army to
return confiscated photographs of the March shooting death of an
Israeli soldier.
   The worst violence erupted Monday in Nablus, the West Bank's
largest city.
   Hospital officials there said an Arab youth was killed and 13
wounded when soldiers opened fire on demonstrators in several
clashes. The army said it had reports of one dead and nine wounded.
   An army spokeswoman said the disturbances erupted after the
funeral of an elderly Nablus man who died of natural causes. When
inciters spread rumors that the man was killed by army gunfire,
residents took to the streets, burning tires and throwing bricks
and stones at troops from rooftops, she said.
   Arab reports said the riots erupted after troops shot and killed
17-year-old Sares Anabtawi in a clash. Officials at Al Ittihad
Hospital said Anabtawi died of a gunshot wound in the chest.
   In subsequent clashes, seven Palestinians suffered gunshot
wounds and 15 were beaten by troops, said Ittihad officials.
   At St. John's Hospital, also in Nablus, six Palestinians were
treated for gunshot wounds, including one who was in serious
condition with a bullet wound in his chest, hospital officials said.
   In the West Bank village of Anabta, troops fired on students who
hurled rocks and empty bottles at them after classes let out, the
army said.
   Ittihad officials identified the victim as 16-year-old Hassan
Addas and said he was hit by three bullets in the chest.
   The deaths brought to 220 the number of Palestinians killed
since the Dec. 8 start of the uprising against Israel's 21-year
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Four Israelis have also
died.
   Monday's casualty toll was the highest for a single day since
June 17, when two Palestinians were killed and 18 wounded during an
army raid of the West Bank village Beit Furik near Nablus.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's aide Avi Pazner said officials
investigated the ABC charges and ``found no evidence that Israeli
security personnel impersonated ABC News persons in arresting a
Palestinian Arab'' last month.
   Pazner said he informed ABC News president Roone Arledge of the
results. Arledge had protested to Shamir last week, demanding an
investigation.
   Dean Reynolds, ABC's Israel correspondent, said Monday: ``ABC
stands by its story. The facts were corroborated by informed
Israeli sources.''
   The network reported last week that Nizar Dakdouk of Salfit
village in the West Bank was arrested by Israelis posing as ABC
News personnel, and it had learned ``the impostors were members of
the Israeli secret security service Shin Bet.''
   In rejecting the demand by Time and Reuters for release of the
confiscated film, the Supreme Court said authorities are entitled
to seize material gathered by reporters if it can help solve a
crime, Israel's Itim news agency reported.
   Troops seized the film after Sgt. Moshe Katz was shot and killed
in the West Bank city of Bethlehem on March 20. The army said at
the time the photographs might help investigators track down the
assailant.
   Itim said the two news organizations sought to drop their appeal
after the army returned the rolls of film on its own, but the
Supreme Court refused and issued its ruling Monday.

   An Omaha, Neb., business executive accused of
passing inside information to a friend settled civil charges Monday
by agreeing to pay the government more than $282,000.
   Donald L. Sturm, 56, signed a consent agreement without
admitting guilt, settling a civil insider trading lawsuit filed by
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   The commission accused Sturm, identified as the owner of a bank
and vice chairman of Omaha-based Peter Kiewit Sons Inc., a
construction and manufacturing company, of getting information from
a relative about the corporate takeover of Aviation Group Inc., a
North Carolina air cargo service.
   Sturm allegedly passed the information to a friend who bought
30,000 shares of stock with money loaned by Sturm and made $128,412
in trading profits, the SEC contended.
   The SEC did not allege that Sturm made any money on the
transaction or had used the friend merely as a middleman to shield
stock purchases.
   ``It's as if Sturm actually made the profits and gave it to the
friend, although he (Sturm) didn't buy the stock,'' said Jerry A.
Isenberg, an SEC official in Washington.
   Isenberg said Sturm _ not his friend _ was charged because Sturm
``was involved in initiating the trade. He financed the trade.''
   Sturm's attorney, Max Gitter, was out of town and unavailable
for comment.
   However, The New York Times said in Tuesday's editions that
Sturm issued a statement saying he did not pass on or possess
material non-public information.
   ``Nor did I know that merger negotiations were under way,'' the
statement read. ``After months of efforts to convince the SEC that
it has drawn wrong conclusions, and knowing that I did nothing
wrong, I have nonetheless chosen to settle this matter rather than
to dispute it any further.''
   The SEC did not identify Sturm's bank, the relative who tipped
him off or the relative's investment bank.
   But SEC filings at the time of the acquisition identified Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. as the investment banking firm.
   Besides the $154,085 in alleged illegal profits plus interest,
Sturm agreed to pay the government $128,412 in penalties for a
total of $282,497.

<HEAD>Party Chief Predicts Jackson, Dukakis Will Resolve Platform
Disputes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic Party chief Paul Kirk says if there
are debates on the party platform at next week's convention, the
arguments won't be bitter ones.
   Kirk suggested Monday that backers of Michael Dukakis, the
certain nominee, were resolving differences with the Jesse Jackson
camp on about a dozen platform planks.
   Jackson's convention manager, Ron Brown, however, left open the
possibility of floor disputes.
   ``We want more specificity in the platform and we're moving in
that direction in the discussions,'' Brown said. ``There might be
some very serious issues of principle that go to the floor of the
convention.''
   Kirk played down that prospect.
   ``I don't expect there will be any so-called floor fights on the
platform. There may be differences of opinion. There may be
agreements to disagree. All the indications that I have are
whatever differences had existed, they are gradually being worked
out,'' he said.
   ``I don't expect that anything related to the platform will
distract from the unity that has been built up in the past year,''
he added. He said he did not expect any ``prolonged or protracted
or ...acrimonious'' debate.
   Kirk on Monday released a partial list of the speakers for the
four convention sessions starting in seven days, and said Jackson
had agreed to the convention schedule.
   The schedule _ still without times without all speakers included
_ has a major focus Tuesday night on Jackson and the platform.
   Kirk said any platform debate would take place late Tuesday
afternoon, before prime time and before Jackson and Sen. Edward
Kennedy are scheduled to speak.
   One concession to Jackson involved the people who will actually
read planks of the platform to the convention and to the nation in
prime time.
   Michigan Gov. James Blanchard, platform chairman, will introduce
the document. Then Jackson supporters Rep. Bill Gray of
Pennsylvania and Texas Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower will
read portions of it.
   Also reading planks will be Sen. Barabara Mikulski of Maryland,
Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, Rep. Bob Matsui of California and
State Sen. Lena Guerrero of Texas.
   Monday night at the convention will include the keynote speech
by Texas Treasurer Ann Richards. She will be introduced by Rep.
Mike Espy of Mississippi _ the first black congressman from the
state since Reconstruction.
   Former President Carter will speak earlier on Monday.
   Wednesday night's schedule includes a tribute to Rep. Morris
Udall of Arizona. As previously announced, Dukakis' name will be
put into nomination by Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton.
   On Thursday night, Birmingham Mayor Richard Arrington will speak
before the nomination of the vice presidential candidate and before
the party's standard bearers give their acceptance speeches.

   Drought could have some impact on the nation's
rice crop this year but not in the way heat and dry weather have
shriveled corn and soybean prospects, according to Agriculture
Department analysts.
   The U.S. rice harvest is all from irrigated land, says Nathan
Childs of the Department's Economic Research Service. But that
doesn't necessarily mean rice is drought proof.
   Much will depend on how the heat affects rice plants and on
irrigation practices, including reduced yields from rising water
costs, he said Monday.
   But generally, the drought is not expected to chew deeply into
rice this year, at least ``not like you're seeing in the other
commodities,'' Childs said.
   According to USDA projections as of June 9, the U.S. rice
harvest this year could be around 157 million hundredweight, up
nearly a fourth from 127.7 million in 1987.
   Total rice use also is growing, says the department's Economic
Research Service in its latest outlook report. And this growth is
expected to continue in 1988-89. Overall, rice demand has increased
by 20 million hundredweight in the last four years.
   ``Greater consumer preference for grain-based foods, aggressive
marketing by rice industry organizations and processors, and wider
availability of easy-to-prepare rice products have helped raise
consumption,'' the report said. ``Growth in the Asian and Hispanic
segment of the U.S. population and increasing popularity of Spanish
and Oriental foods among all Americans have also helped expand
consumption.''
   Another growth has been in the amount of rice used to make beer
_ an estimated 17 million hundredweight this year, up from less
than 14 million in 1984-85.
   ``Brewers' use makes up about 20 percent of total domestic
consumption and continues to show year-to-year increases,'' the
report said. ``Anheuser-Busch, the largest U.S. brewery, uses rice
exclusively s an adjunct in several of its products. Gains in
market share by this company over the past several years have
helped increase rice use in beer, even though growth in total beer
consumption has slowed.''
   In all, domestic rice use may be about 83.5 million
hundredweight in 1988-89, up from 80.8 million in 1987-88 and 76.3
million in 1986-87.
   Rice exports are forecast at 77 million hundredweight, up from
70 million last year but down from 85.4 million in 1986-87.
   ``Assuming normal weather in major rice exporting countries,
(export) competition likely will be intense,'' the report said.
   Expectations of smaller rice supplies in 1987-88 triggered rice
price increases, and in early 1988 U.S. cash prices were
substantially higher than world prices. However, those eased when
major importers spurned the higher-priced U.S. rice.
   ``Also, expectations of increased exports from Thailand further
weakened world prices,'' the report added. ``Assuming normal
weather, world production will increased in 1988-89 and keep prices
below (the level of) 1987-88.''
   For U.S. producers, rice prices may be in the range of $5 to $7
per hundredweight, down from $7 to $7.25 in 1987-88 but above the
average of $3.75 in 1986-87, the report said.

   A recent survey by the American Association of
Crop Insurers shows that more than 370,000 farmers bought
multiple-peril crop insurance this year, a 19 percent increase from
1987.
   ``Considering that most of these producers acted before there
was evidence of a drought indicates that the crop insurance program
is taking hold in the farm country as a risk-management tool,''
said E. Eugene Gantz, executive vice president of the association.
   The signup deadline in most areas was April 15, well before the
severe drought conditions set in, he said.
   Gantz said preliminary estimates show 65 million to 70 million
acres will likely be protected by crop insurance this year,
compared with 62 million in 1987. The face value of protection of
insurance written in 1987 was more than $6 billion and probably
will increase this year, he said.
   ``These are producers who didn't want to wait for the federal
government to come along with a handout,'' Gantz said in his
report. ``They acted in a businesslike manner to protect their own
farms and their own families from possible disaster.''
   The multiple-peril crop insurance program began seven years ago
and includes commercial companies that are reinsured against
catastrophic losses by the Federal Crop Insurance Program, an
agency of the Agriculture Department. The FCIC also handles
insurance directly through master marketers, who account for about
20 percent of the total.
   Gantz said the FCIC has indicated there will be no program
changes in 1989 for most crops, beginning with those that will be
planted this fall.

<TEXT>
   On Soviet-Polish relations:
   There is still much in Soviet-Polish relations that does not
meet the needs of both sides. ...
   This applies to direct human contacts as well. New crossings
will be set up on the Soviet-Polish border, the possibilities of
contacts across the border will be expanded and more railway and
air lines will connect our countries. The idea of establishing a
ferry between Szscecin and Leningrad is being discussed. ...
   Our joint history is a rich, full-blooded history of two
neighboring peoples. We have causes for pride, (but) there are
things that have to be revealed and shown more fully.
   This history also has its complexities, what is called `blank
spots.' Notions that are based more on emotions rather than on
strict scientific knowledge form at times around them.
   There is only one road to the truth here: study of facts, calm
comparison of viewpoints and scientific discussions.
   History cannot be replayed, but lessons can and should be drawn
from it.

   On the East-West ideology battle:
   It is very important in these conditions to clear the
ideological struggle of foul play. Psychological warfare and
cultivation of mistrust among nations are incompatible with the
norms of civilized state-to-state contacts.
   It is essential to do away with the preaching of militarism,
hatred and enmity so that differences between countries become a
stimulus for cooperation rather than a hindrance to it.
   The nations need the truth about one another. Western society
has a poor knowledge of realities in the socialist world. It has
been hammered into people's heads there since they were in diapers
that the Communists are the bad guys who have enslaved their
peoples and are sharpening their knives against the free nations of
the West. ...
   We have to abandon our own simplistic approaches in presenting
Western realities as well.
   It is imperative to see all the diversity, the complexity and
equivocality, the contradictoriness of what is happening in Western
countries _ in economic, political, social and other spheres.

   On conventional arms:
   As far as the governments of NATO countries are concerned, they
traditionally look at conventional arms as a legitimate component
of power politics and uphold the nuclear deterence concept. While
paying lip service to the need to reduce conventional arms, they
continue in fact building up their military resources. ...
   We would, for instance, be prepared to withdraw our matching
aircraft from forward-deployment sites in Eastern Europe if NATO
agrees not to base its 72 F-16 fighter-bombers, rejected by Spain,
in Italy. ...
   The time has come for deeper troops and arms cuts in Europe, and
this requires expediting work in Vienna to hammer out a mandate for
opening negotiations both on the reduction of conventional forces
and armaments and on confidence-building measures on a Europe-wide
scale. ...
   We suggest effecting the cuts in three phases:
   At the first phase, all the imbalances and asymmetries between
NATO and the Warsaw Treaty as regards both troop strength and
primary arms are to be identified and eliminated. This approach
could be applied both to the entire European continent as a whole
and to its individual regions, for example Central Europe, Southern
Europe, etc.
   For identifying the imbalances and asymmetries, we suggest
exchanging initial data _ even before the talks or simultaneously
with their commencement _in amounts to be dictated by the agreed
subject of the negotiations.
   Careful checks on the data, including on-site inspections, are
to be run soon after the start of the talks so as to avoid a
repetition of the sad experience of the debates on numbers that
once deadlocked the Vienna talks on central Europe.
   Let me note in passing that if NATO shows readiness, we can
discuss the issue of the imbalances and asymmetries even before the
start of the formal talks, in connection with the exchanges of data
on troops and weaponry.
   At the second phase, the NATO and Warsaw Treaty forces are to be
reduced by 500,000 men on each side from the levels existing after
the elimination of the imbalances and asymmetries. The cuts are to
be carried out by disbanding military units along with elimination
of their organic arms.
   At the third phase, the cuts are to be continued so as to
finally lend the military units of both military alliances a purely
defensive nature.
   All the reduction phases would provide for effective
verificaiton arrangements, including on-site inspections.
   I would like to add to this that we are prepared not only at the
third phase but also from the very start of the cuts to come to
terms on the priority reduction of tactical nuclear weapons,
tactical strike aircraft and tanks.

   Bears, deer, skunks and other creatures that
usually prefer to stay far from humans are being driven by the
drought to unaccustomed boldness in their search for food and water.
   So far this year, 30 bears have been spotted from Reno to Lake
Tahoe in western Nevada compared with the normal three to five
annually, and there has been a virtual invasion of skunks in
residential areas, wildlife officials said Monday.
   ``Anything that's green looks good to them,'' said Gilbert
Marrugo, the state director of animal damage control. ``The best
thing to do is not feed them because they'll come back for more.''
   Marrugo said the Reno-Sparks area and neighboring counties are
seeing a huge increase in the number of rabbits and skunks near
rural homes, although exact numbers are unavailable since many
encounters aren't reported.
   ``There's an explosion of rabbits in the area this year,''
Marrugo said. ``We've already had five or six complaints of damage
they've caused in flower beds or hay fields _ not a lot, but the
summer's just beginning. A pack of them can ruin 25 acres.''
   Skunks also are showing up in record numbers, particularly in
the valleys north of Reno and in Verdi to the west, Marrugo said.
   ``One woman in Verdi has trapped 29 skunks under her house in
the past two years,'' he said. ``It's a virtual invasion in some
areas.''
   Gregg Tanner, a supervising game biologist for the Nevada
Department of Wildlife, said big game and small animals are
migrating in search of new water supplies and range land because
back-to-back dry years have decreased forage and stream flows.
   ``They concentrate around any free water source they find,'' he
said.
   Already this year, more than 30 black bears have been sighted
looking for food among humans, mostly around the Lake Tahoe Basin
area, he said. In a normal year, the state Wildlife Department
receives reports of three to five sightings.
   ``I think you can attribute this to the drought year,'' Tanner
said. ``Their normal food supply has been impacted so they're
looking through the garbage for food.
   ``There have been no confrontations'' with humans, since the
bears usually are scared off, Tanner said. ``But any time you get
urban dwellers directly in contact with a bear there's a lot of _
well _ concerned folks.''
   A mild winter spared most of the state's mule deer, leaving a
10-year high of 250,000 of the long-eared, black-tailed creatures
competing for scarce forage and water, Tanner said. Now, those deer
along with bighorn sheep and antelopes are migrating toward farms,
ranches and other rural residences in search of food and water.
   ``During the summer months it will only get worse,'' Tanner
said. ``I expect a difficult fall, having to deal with all the
problems to stop the depredation.''
   Shriveling wetlands in the western Nevada valleys normally fed
by winter snowmelt are another peril of the drought, Tanner said.
Small die-offs of fish and waterfowl already have occurred, he
said, and more are expected.
   ``It's too early to count our losses yet,'' he said. ``We just
have to take the lumps when they come.''

   A general-alarm fire engulfed a huge
distribution warehouse complex for the Safeway supermarket chain
late Monday, sending flames hundreds of feet into the air.
   The flames and massive clouds of smoke could be seen across the
San Francisco Bay in downtown San Francisco, about 15 miles to the
southwest.
   ``It seems like it's burning down the whole thing,'' said
warehouse worker George Tomasis.
   Truck drivers could be seen on television station broadcasts
frantically trying to get dozens of trucks away from the building
after the fire broke out, some of them driving off while nearly
surrounded by flames.
   Tomasis said the fire broke out in the paper products section of
the complex, which includes several buildings, and quickly spread
to the meat and produce sections.
   There were no reports of injuries, said Fire Department
spokesman Gary Gray.
   Gray said all available firefighters in the city were called to
battle the blaze, which was reported at 10:02 p.m., and that about
50 firefighters responded.
   The warehouse complex covers approximately five square blocks in
an industrial area. It serves as a distribution center for the
grocery store's Northern California supermarkets. Safeway has its
headquarters in nearby Oakland.

<HEAD>Convention Closes Without Resolving Homosexual Ordination Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM IRWIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Episcopal Church leaders have closed their 69th
General Convention without adopting a proposal that could have
encouraged the ordination of homosexuals.
   A resolution Monday expanding ``access to the selection process
for ordination'' for all persons, including homosexuals _ but
refusing to recognize a right to ordination for all _ fell one vote
short of passage in the church's House of Deputies.
   The 900-member House of Deputies, divided between lay and
clerical church members, and the 200-member House of Bishops
establish policy for the 2.7 million-member church, whose 10-day
convention ended Monday. The conventions are held every three years.
   Delegates considered almost 500 resolutions at the convention,
which opened July 2. But the question of ordaining gay priests
dominated the final days of the convention.
   Current church law says candidates for ordination must be at
least 21 years of age and pass prescribed medical, psychological
and academic tests. But leaders of some of the church's 118
dioceses in the United States have ordained homosexual priests
without running afoul of Episcopal canon law.
   In 1979, the 66th General Convention approved a resolution
stating in part, ``We believe it is not appropriate for this church
to ordain a practicing homosexual.''
   That resolution, however, is not a part of canon law, which
draws a distinction between homosexual activity, which it says is
sinful, and homosexual orientation, which it says is not.
   Church leaders on both sides of the homosexual debate agreed
that Monday's vote left the issue unresolved.
   Canon law was left intact and thus maintained discretion within
the dioceses as to consideration of homosexual candidates for the
priesthood, said the Rt. Rev. Paul Moore Jr., bishop of New York
City.
   ``I'm not unhappy that it didn't pass,'' said the Rt. Rev.
George N. Hunt, bishop of Rhode Island. ``We are not of one mind on
the subject. Until we are, we should be cautious of passing
anything until we can speak with authority.''
   ``I was disappointed that, to the portion of people who tend to
see themselves as being disenfranchised from the church, (approval
of the resolution) would have given some pastoral concern,'' said
the Rt. Rev. O'Kelley Whitaker, bishop of central New York.
   But, Whitaker added: ``It doesn't cripple the church.
Homosexuals are involved in the ordination process in many dioceses
already. It is happening anyway.''
   Confusion over parliamentary procedure marred the homosexual
debate, church leaders said.
   ``I've been a bishop a long time ... and I have never heard as
many parliamentary procedure tactics as I have seen in this house
this week,'' Presiding Bishop Edward Browning told the House of
Bishops.
   Also Monday, both houses approved a resolution opposing
``abortion as a means of birth control, family planning or sex
selection.''
   The resolution in its final form acknowledged that women in the
United States have a legal right to medically safe abortion. But it
also deleted a passage expressing the church's opposition to any
government action barring a woman's right to abortion.
   Delegates on Monday also approved a resolution extending for two
years the experimental use oelief and practice, curtail masculine
references to God as much as possible. The church's Liturgical
Commission later will evaluate the experiment.
   Among the final resolutions approved was one calling frrowly
rejected the resolution Sunday, when some delegates claimed the
boycott would hurt U.S. businesses. But the deputies reversed their
vote Monday to express solidarity with Anglican Archbishop Desmond
Tutu of South Africa, who has promoted the boycott as a means of
protesting racial segregation in that nation.

28,099.84 total by the end of trading.
   The dollar opened at 132.90 yen but fell slightly in morning
trading. It retreated further in afternoon dealings before closing
the day at 132.70 yen, down 0.63 yen from Monday's 133.33 yen. It
traded between 132.60 yen and 133.08 yen during the day.
   An exchange dealer at the Bank of Tokyo said there was no major
market-affecting news behind the dollar's decline, which followed
an overnight fall in New York.
   The dollar closed at 133.07 yen Monday in New York, down from
last Friday's closing of 133.29 yen.
   The dealer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the dollar
would trade in a narrow range against other major currencies until
the announcement of U.S. trade figures for May, slated for Friday.
   He said many market players were predicting the U.S. monthly
trade deficit for May could widen.

   The ``black box'' recorders from the downed
Iranian jetliner in the Persian Gulf should be recoverable,
clearing up questions about the plane's flight path and whether its
pilots received radio warnings, U.S. aviation experts say.
   Several U.S. aviation experts, speaking Monday on condition that
they not be identified by name, speculated that the recorders
likely survived the crash unless the missile from the USS Vincennes
hit directly where they were located in the rear of the aircraft.
   And although the commander of the Iranian Navy denied the
recorders had been found, a published report from Dubai in the
United Arab Emirates quoted unidentified salvage experts as saying
that the so-called ``black boxes'' had been recovered from the gulf
waters.
   All commercial jetliners are required to have the recorders, one
that monitors cockpit conversation and another that tracks
operations of the plane.
   They are housed in separate boxes that actually are painted
orange, but often become blackened by fire in airline crashes. They
are located in the tail section of the plane and designed to
withstand severe impacts.
   The Iran Air Airbus A-300 shot down by the Vincennes on July 3,
killing all 290 people aboard, was believed to have been equipped
with a sophisticated digital flight recorder that would provide a
broad range of operating information as well as a cockpit voice
recorder.
   If they are found in good condition and were properly maintained
by the Iranians, the recorders could provide a wealth of
information to investigators including a detailed reproduction of
the plane's flight path from the time of takeoff, the experts said.
   The cockpit voice recorder, which monitors radio communications
and cockpit conversation on a continuous 30-minute loop, would
indicate whether the Iran Air pilots received repeated radio
warnings as maintained by the Pentagon.
   The cockpit tape would be expected to cover the entire flight of
the Iranian jetliner as well as the period during which the plane
was taxiing and awaiting takeoff at Bandar Abbas in Iran for the
short trip across the gulf to Dubai.
   In addition to radio communications, the cockpit tape would
reveal conversation within the cockpit and indicate whether the
pilots might have intended anything other than a routine flight and
whether they might have been distracted by mechanical or other
problems causing them to fly off course or fail to acknowledge
radio warnings, the experts suggested.
   The flight data recorder in the A-300 is a sophisticated digital
version that provides more than 80 measures involving the plane's
flight operations including altitude, heading, air speed and
whether the plane was experiencing any flight difficulties.
   The Pentagon has said that the commercial jetliner was perceived
in part as a threat to the Vincennes because of the plane's unusual
flight path and speed. Officials said the jetliner was descending,
traveling faster than normal for a commercial airliner, and heading
directly toward the U.S. ship. There also have been discrepancies
as to how far the A-300 was off from its intended flight path.

<TEXT>
   Part of a deposition by Attorney General Edwin
Meese III gives conflicting indications of whether he knew about
planned payments to the Israeli Labor Party in 1985.
   Meese attorney James Rocap on Monday released a 12-page portion
of the deposition given to the office of independent counsel James
C. McKay. The deposition was the focus of news reports over the
weekend that Meese gave differing recollections between November
1987 and February about planned payments to the Israeli party.
   The planned payments could have constituted a violation of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
   In the deposition, Meese was asked by McKay's office whether he
understood that the Israeli government and the labor party were to
receive funds from the pipeline.
   Meese, referring to a 1985 memo he received from longtime friend
E. Robert Wallach about the planned labor party payments, said: ``I
can't recall specifically, but that certainly would be consistent
with my understanding and would explain why Mr. (then-Israeli Prime
Minister and labor party chief Shimon) Peres was personally
interested.''
   Meese was then asked whether he had any specific recollection of
Wallach telling him of the labor party's interest or financial
stake in the operation.
   ``I have a general recollection but even as we sit here now I
don't know how that was all going to be achieved,'' Meese replied.
   Pressed to elaborate, Meese said, ``I have a general
recollection that the Labor Party was very much interested.'' He
added that he couldn't recall except through the words of Wallach's
memo in front of him, which ``is consistent with my recollection.''
   Then, for the ensuing 10 pages of the deposition, Meese says
that Peres didn't make any reference to the labor party's stake in
the pipeline in a conversation the two men had, that Meese never
discussed with Wallach where the pipeline money would go and that
he never discussed with Wallach the propriety of the labor party
receiving any funds.
   Later in the deposition, Meese also said that as to an Israeli
stake and labor party stake in the project, ``I have no even
general recollection of the benefit to the labor party other than
as is expressed in that ... memorandum that you showed me.''
   Finally, after 12 pages of questioning about the planned labor
party payments, Meese suggested he hadn't focused on the portion of
the memo from Wallach relating to planned payments to the labor
party until he was questioned that day.
   After news media reports surfaced early this year about the
Wallach memo's reference to planned labor party payments, Meese
said publicly that he didn't recall reading that portion of
Wallach's memo relating to any such plan.
   The lawyer, James Rocap, said Meese filed a declaration with
McKay's office after reporters suggested that Meese's public
statement didn't square with his earlier deposition. Rocap said
information about the deposition apparently had been leaked to
reporters.
   ``I was not stating that I had a recollection, specific or
general, that the Labor Party had a financial stake in the
project,'' the Feb. 18. 1988, declaration said.
   The New York Times, which on Saturday published portions of
independent counsel McKay's 830-page report on the Meese
investigation, said McKay concluded that the memo was the only
``direct evidence'' of a bribery plan and therefore insufficient to
conclude that Meese violated the law.

   Here is the statement by White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater regarding compensation for the families of victims
in the Iranian airliner shooting:
   The president has reviewed U.S. policy in the Persian Gulf where
our military forces are protecting vital interests of the free
world. He has expressed his complete satisfaction with the policy
and reiterated his belief that the actions of the USS Vincennes on
July 3 in the case of the Iranian airliner were justifiable
defensive actions.
   At the same time, he remains personally saddened at the tragic
death of the innocent victims of this accident and has already
expressed his deep regret to their families.
   Prompted by the humanitarian traditions of our nation, the
president has decided that the United States will offer
compensation, on an ex gratia basis, to the families of the victims
who died in the Iranian airliner incident. Details concerning
amounts, timing and other matters remain to be worked out.
   It should be clearly understood that payment will go to the
families, not governments, and will be subject to the normal U.S.
legal requirements, including, if necessary, appropriate action by
Congress.
   In the case of Iran, arrangements will be made through
appropriate third parties. This offer of ex gratia compensation is
consistent with international practice and is a humanitarian effort
to ease the hardship of the families. It is offered on a voluntary
basis, not on the basis of any legal liability or obligation.
   The responsibility for this tragic incident, and for the deaths
of hundreds of thousands of other innocent victims as a result of
the Iran-Iraq war, lies with those who refuse to end the conflict.
   A particularly heavy burden of responsibility rests with the
government of Iran which has refused for almost a year to accept
and implement Security Council Resolution 598, while it continues
unprovoked attacks on innocent neutral shipping and crews in the
international waters of the gulf.
   In fact, at the time of the Iran Air incident, U.S. forces were
militarily engaged with Iranian forces as a result of the latter's
unprovoked attacks upon neutral ships and a U.S. Navy helicopter.
The urgent necessity to end this conflict is reinforced by the
dangers it poses to neighboring countries and the deplorable
precedent of the increasingly frequent use of chemical weapons by
both sides, causing still more casualties.
   Only an end to the war, an objective we desire, can halt the
immense suffering in the region and put an end to innocent loss of
life. Our goal is peace in the gulf and on land. We urge Iran and
Iraq to work with the Security Council for an urgent comprehensive
settlement of the war pursuant to Resolution 598. Meanwhile, United
States forces will continue their mission in the area, keenly aware
of the risks involved and ready to face them.

it joined the century-old Berne Convention for the Protection of
Literary and Artistic Works, a State Department official says.
   Assistant Secretary of State Eugene McAllister told the Senate

protect U.S. copyrights in 79 countries, 24 of which do not belong
to the Universal Copyright Convention. The United States is already
a member of that accord.
   Copyright official Ralph Oman testified that the list of 24
covers ``minor markets but major pirates.'' He did not further

   The measure, sponsored by Sen. William Armstrong, was criticized
Monday by Sen. Lowell Weicker, R-Conn., as ``good, old-fashioned

   Two former Royal Jordanian airlines employees
are in federal protective custody to testify against a suspected
Lebanese terrorist charged with leading the hijacking of their
plane in 1985.
   The two unidentified members of the jetliner's flight crew
entered the federal witness protection program after agreeing to
testify at the trial of Fawaz Younis, a prosecutor said Monday at a
pre-trial hearing in the case.
   Younis, a former member of Lebanon's Shiite Amal militia, is
charged with leading a group of five men who stormed the Boeing 727
with AK-47 assult rifles at Beirut International Airport on June
11, 1985.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Ramsey Johnson said the former airline
employees were uprooted from their homes in the Middle East and
entered the U.S. protection program after ``their decision to
testify in the trial.''
   Johnson said FBI agents are still trying to locate an
Arab-speaking passenger who identified Younis at a court-ordered
lineup last March. ``We believe he is an excellent witness,'' the
prosecutor told U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker.
   Younis was arrested last September after he and a friend, Jamal
Hamdan, went aboard an FBI-chartered yacht in international waters
off the coast of Cyprus.
   Hamdan, who cooperated with the FBI in luring Younis to the
yacht with the prospect of making a drug deal, is also in
protective custody, Johnson said.
   No date has been set for the trial.
   A federal appeals court is considering whether statements Younis
made to FBI agents during four days of interrogation aboard a Navy
ship in the Mediterranean can be admitted into evidence.
   Prosecutors appealed Parker's ruling in February that Younis'
confession was illegally obtained because he didn't understand his
right to remain silent.
   Parker ruled that Younis was unable to make a responsible
decision because of his unfamiliarity with the U.S. legal system.
The judge also noted that during his interrogation, Younis was
seasick and suffered pain in his wrists, which were broken when two
FBI agents slammed him to the deck of the yacht.
   At Monday's hearing, Parker said he had found a classified
document that contradicted a previous assertion by Johnson that the
FBI had never considered placing an attorney aboard the ship to
advise Younis.
   Johnson had told the judge in February that the idea ``just
didn't come up.''
   Parker, indicating the secret document he had examined
contradicted that answer, told Johnson: ``You are charged with the
knowledge of the information contained'' in the secret documents
turned over to the court.
   On June 30, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ordered
Parker to conduct a hearing on whether to admit the document into
evidence.
   The appeals court said the document ``raises questions that go
directly'' to Younis' claim he was denied a right to counsel during
his interrogation.
   The judge gave Johnson 48 hours to consult government agencies
about declassifying the document and scheduled a hearing for next
Monday.

<HEAD>Dukakis Leads Bush In Washington Poll</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis leads Republican George
Bush by 11 percentage points, 47 percent to 36 percent, in a new
poll of Washington state voters published by The Seattle Times.
   The telephone poll of 503 voters in the state indicated a large
portion of each candidates' support is soft, however.
   Voting ``definitely Dukakis'' were 26 percent, while 21 percent
said they would ``probably'' vote for him. Those ``definitely'' for
Vice President Bush numbered 19 percent, while 17 were ``probably''
for him. Seventeen percent were undecided.
   The poll was conducted last week by Elway Research for The
Seattle Times, which reported the results Monday. The margin of
error was plus or minus 5 percentage points.
   The poll indicated little difference in the results when Dukakis
was matched with several potential running mates, except that the
likely Democratic nominee lost ground when paired with Jesse
Jackson, who finished second overall in delegates.
   Jackson's presence on a Democratic ticket pushed Bush slightly
ahead of Dukakis, 44-41 percent.

<TEXT>
   Relatives of two women killed when a
department store collapsed in a thunderstorm have filed lawsuits
charging that the roof was unsafe.
   Juan Lopez-Butron of Matamoros, Mexico, whose wife, Graciela
Cortinas de Lopez, was the fifth victim pulled from the rubble,
filed two lawsuits Monday.
   Lopez-Butron accused the Amigo Store of failing to warn his wife
a collapse could occur and failing to properly inspect the roof and
its drainage system.
   In a second suit, he accused the store's builders, Adams
Brothers General Contractors Inc., of failing to install a safe
roof, failing to inspect it and failing to properly install an
adequate way to drain the flat surface. In that suit, he requests a
trial by jury and asks for no more than $5 million in damages,
interest and court costs.
   Luis Enrique Cortinas Villarreal filed a suit seeking damages
for the death of his mother, Marisela Villarreal Vda. de Rivera. He
named Bernard Levine, owner of the store, and his company, Los
Amigos Inc., in the suit, which alleges negligence.
   Calls to Levine's home in Brownsville were not answered Monday.
   Meanwhile, officials continued to investigate why the building
collapsed during heavy rains Thursday, crushing 14 people to death
and injuring at least 47 others.
   Glenn Winslow of the Southern Building Code Congress of
Birmingham, Ala., said investigators were checking whether some
special characteristic of the building caused it to be affected by
shifting rainwater that could have led to its collapse.
   ``In this case, it's going to be very difficult, because of the
way the material was removed during the rescue,'' Winslow said. The
debris was later carted to the city dump.
   He also said investigators were looking at whether the weight of
the water-soaked building materials could have contributed to the
collapse.
   On Monday, heavier than usual street and foot traffic flowed
along the downtown street past where the building once stood. Some
passersby slowed to look at the store's swept-clean floor _ all
that remains of the three-story structure.
   Nearby stores that closed during the rescue effort reopened,
with the exception of the adjacent Woolworth's, in which rescuers
knocked a hole in the wall to reach surviors.
   Haisook Lee, owner of East-West Fashions across the street, said
she lost a good deal of business while her store was closed
Thursday through Saturday. ``But we had to close. We're going to
have to catch up.''
   Ms. Lee said she planned to contact the owner of her building
today for a safety inspection.

   Authorities Tuesday captured a
convicted murderer who escaped from a state prison yard with two
other inmates in a helicopter that lifted off in a hail of gunfire
the day before, a state police official said.
   Daniel Mahoney, 30, was captured shortly before 1 a.m., said
state police Sgt. John Balderston.
   A Corrections officer spotted Mahoney's tracks around 7:30 p.m.,
and called in a canine unit, Balderston said. Officers followed the
tracks along the Rio Grande to a bridge near Los Lunas about 20
miles south of here.
   The other two inmates were captured Monday in a dramatic aerial
chase along the Rio Grande Valley that lasted nearly two hours,
officials said. Also arrested was a woman authorities believe is
Mahoney's girlfriend.
   The pilot, who flew the same helicopter in the movie ``Rambo
III,'' was being held at the Santa Fe County Jail overnight while
authorities checked out his story that he had been hijacked,
officials said.
   The copter nearly rammed a pursuing U.S. Customs helicopter and
tried to force a police helicopter into a crane.
   ``We both hung with him. We knew he had to set down because he
was running low on fuel,'' said Maj. John Denko, pilot of the state
police chopper.
   About 100 prisoners were in the exercise yard at the
Penitentiary of New Mexico near Santa Fe when the Aerospatiale
Gazelle helicopter, landed around 9:50 a.m. and picked up the three
inmates.
   Guards in two towers opened fire as the chopper took off, said
Don Caviness, a spokesman for the New Mexico Corrections Department.
   The copter flew first to a small airport at Los Lunas, 80 miles
away. Waiting police wounded and captured one inmate in a
gunbattle. The woman also was taken into custody, while Mahoney
escaped on foot.
   The copter then took off again, leading the customs and police
helicopters on a 20-mile chase to Albuquerque International Airport
before finally landing as its gasoline supply dwindled. The other
inmate was captured there.
   Mahoney was serving life plus 60 years for second-degree murder
and armed robbery in Florida.
   Randy Mack Lackey, 36, of Curry County, N.M., serving a
nine-year sentence for larceny, was wounded in the shoulder and
captured at the Los Lunas airport. Francis Preston Mitchell, 26,
serving life for first-degree murder in Utah, was captured at the
Albuquerque airport. Beverly Shoemaker of Santa Fe was also taken
into custody at Los Lunas.
   Mahoney and Mitchell were being held under an interstate compact
that provides for prisoner exchanges.
   Roadblocks were thrown up from Albuquerque to Socorro as
authorities pressed the search for Mahoney. Police using dogs and
officers on horseback and in airplanes also joined in.
   ``We understand he may be armed,'' a dispatcher at the Valencia
County Sheriff's Department who asked her name not be used said
late Monday. ``He is considered very dangerous.''

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Wojciech
Jaruzelski, speaking of painful episodes in their countries' shared
history, say no one should shirk from examining the past honestly.
   But the Soviet and Polish Communist leaders stopped short Monday
of uttering the one word that symbolizes the most painful episode
in Polish-Soviet relations and the one historical ``blank spot''
most Poles want explicated.
   Neither said ``Katyn,'' the name of the forest in the Soviet
Union where the bodies of about 4,300 Polish army officers were
uncovered by Nazi troops during World War II.
   Each of the officers, representing the cream of Polish society,
was bound and shot with a single bullet to the base of the skull.
   Official Soviet and Polish histories have long maintained that
the officers were killed by the Nazis in 1941, but independent
historians and most Poles believe they were killed in 1940 on the
orders of Josef Stalin by the NKVD secret police, predecessor of
the KGB.
   A joint Soviet-Polish historical commission was charged last
year with investigating the Katyn massacre and other painful
``blank spots,'' including the 1920 war between Poland and the
Soviet Union and Stalin's murder of virtually all leading members
of the Polish Communist Party in the late 1930s.
   But Polish officials have in recent days been playing down the
possibility of any dramatic admission by Gorbachev during his trip
to Poland this week.
   On Monday, when Gorbachev began the six-day visit to the Soviet
Union's largest East bloc ally, a small group of young men climbed
atop a bus stop in central Warsaw and unfurled a banner reading,
``We demand the truth about Katyn. Reparation for deportations.''
   ``Katyn is a symbol of cruelty,'' said leaflets they handed out.
``It is a still-bleeding blank spot, the explanation of which all
Poles demand.''
   Among the Katyn victims and 11,000 other officers interned by
the Soviets whose fates remain unknown, there were 800 doctors, 50
professors and hundreds of engineers, lawyers, teachers and
writers, the leaflets said.
   ``Poles have the right to know the truth about this holocaust on
their outstanding fellow countrymen,'' the leaflets said.
   In his speech to Poland's parliament on Monday, Gorbachev
promised that more would be said about ``blank spots.''
   ``There are things that have to be revealed and shown more
fully,'' he said. ``There is only one road to the truth here: study
of facts, calm comparison of viewpoints and scientific discussions.
History cannot be replayed, but lessons can and should be drawn
from it.''
   Jaruzelski voiced a similar theme: ``Every crime and every human
suffering have a moral dimension. They cannot be crossed out and
one must not remain silent about them.
   ``Joint works of Polish and Soviet historians are under way. We
hope that they will allow us to better learn about the background,
course and nature of various dramatic events.''
   Anticipating reporters' questions about Katyn, officials
scheduled a press conference after the parliament session by the
Polish and Soviet chairmen of the historical commission
investigating Katyn.
   The chairmen said they had some reason to question to the Soviet
source materials on Katyn, but could not say anything more without
extensive further study.

<HEAD>Governing Party Claims Victory, But Final Returns Still Not In</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ANDERSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governing party says new election returns
confirm its claim that its candidate, Carlos Salinas de Gortari,
won the presidency, even though votes are still being counted
nearly a week after the election.
   The Institutional Revolutionary Party denies that final results
are being delayed by vote fraud and squabbling among members of the
party that is now losing its 60-year near monopoly in Mexican
politics.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Bartlett said Monday that Salinas had
received 52.89 percent of the 13.24 million votes counted from
Wednesday's election.
   He said the leftist National Democratic Front's candidate,
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, was second with 29.1 percent and Manuel
Clouthier of the conservative National Action Party was third with
16.68 percent.
   The Federal Election Commission did not say how many votes
remained to be counted. It said it would release final totals on
Wednesday and blamed the delays on computer problems and bad
weather.
   Institutional Revolutionary Party officials conceded Monday that
Cardenas won 58 percent of the vote in his home state of Michoacan,
compared with 25 percent for Salinas.
   Party officials in Mexico City also said privately that Cardenas
was expected to win in the federal capital, which has one-quarter
of Mexico's people.
   Cardenas has claimed a national victory and Clouthier has said
he is leading the balloting.
   The governing party has not lost a presidential, senate or
gubernatorial race since it was founded in 1929.
   The latest vote tallies ``confirmed the triumph of our candidate
for the presidency,'' said Jorge de la Vega Dominguez, the
Institutional Revolutionary Party chairman.
   ``It is our duty to defend without wavering or compromises (the
governing party's) popular mandate,'' he said in a statement he
read durign a news conference.
   De la Vega denied numerous reports that the vote tally has been
delayed by party infighting.
   ``The (Institutional Revolutionary Party) is solidly united in
its sectoral (and) territorial structure and with its broad
militant base. The leadership forms a single united will with our
victorious candidate,'' he said.
   The party reportedly has been split between members of the old
guard who resist change and reformists loyal to Salinas, who is
seeking to modernize the political system.
   Opposition members have said the vote tally has been delayed by
traditionalists who want to doctor the returns to reflect the
party's usually huge margin of victory _ in excess of 70 percent in
past elections.
   The commission reconvened Monday night to release additional
results in races for the 500-seat Chamber of Deputies, only to
adjourn until Wednesday.
   Bartlett said the delay would allow time for the commission to
obtain final results for the remaining congressional seats, the
Senate and the presidency.
   Partial returns released Monday gave 242 of the 500 seats in the
lower house to the governing party, 31 to National Action Party and
10 to parties that support Cardenas.
   Cardenas rejected the commission figures and said the slow vote
count was enabling the government and the governing party to
manipulate the results.
   ``The figures of the Federal Electoral Commission are not
believable and only can be the product of fraud,'' Cardenas said.
He said his coalition might call a protest march for Saturday in
Mexico City.
   Clouthier said irregularities in the elections ``have
demonstrated the incapacity of the Mexican government to organize
trustworthy elections.''
   ``There were two elections: those of July 6 conducted by the
people, and those conducted by the rulers last night,'' he said.
   Opposition parties kept vigils outside district offices in an
effort to prevent manipulation of the results.

   North Korea has rejected as nothing new the
proposals of President Roh Tae-woo of South Korea for improving
relations between the two nations, the north's official news agency
said today.
   Roh on Thursday unveiled a plan to ease his nation's bitter

peaceful reunification of the divided peninsula.
   ``This is nothing new and is not worth examination,'' the Korean

   The news agency, monitored in Tokyo, quoted the statement as

and reunification, they should respond, though a bit late, to our
proposal for convocation of a north-south joint conference.''
   In the July 7 special declaration, Roh called for broad trade,
humanitarian, cultural and political contacts with the north.
   The two Koreas have been bitter rivals since their land was
divided at the end of World War II in 1945. They fought the Korean
war in 1950-53.
   Talks between the two Koreas have been held intermittantly since
the early 1970s. They opened new talks in the early 1980s, but
North Korea suspended all dialogue in 1986 to protest joint
U.S.-South Korea military exercises.
   In Seoul, the Yonhap News Agency reported today that South Korea
was considering encouraging the United States and other Western
nations to open trade links with the north to help ease tensions.
   The agency, quoting an unidentified official, said the
government will make efforts to induce American and Western
companies to establish contacts with the north on a gradual basis.
No official confirmation was available on the report.

   Contra leaders say there is little hope for a
peaceful move toward democracy in Nicaragua, where the Sandinista
government has expelled U.S. diplomats, quelled dissent and shut a
newspaper and radio station.
   ``They had been acting like a chameleon for months and months.
Now they have shown their true colors,'' Adolfo Calero, a director
of the U.S.-backed rebels, said by telephone today from Washington.
   ``We just hope that the United States, Europe and the free world
once and for all accept that they are totalitarian and never had
any interest in democracy,'' he said.
   The Sandinista government on Monday gave the U.S. ambassador and
seven other embassy officials three days to leave, accusing them of
state terrorism.
   Opposition newspaper La Prensa and Roman Catholic radio station
Radio Catolica were ordered shut down. The moves came a day after
police clashed with thousands of demonstrators at an
anti-Sandinista rally 40 miles outside Managua.
   Calero said such actions fly in the face of a peace agreement
signed three months ago with the Contras in which the government
pledged a series of steps aimed at satisfying the rebels' demands
for ``democratization.''
   ``At this point, I can't see any further negotiations for a
peaceful transition to freedom in Nicaragua,'' Calero said. ``The
Sandinistas have made it clear they're just not interested.''
   Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, another Contra director based in Miami,
said the rebels have been negotiating in good faith with the
Sandinistas, but that continued repression inside Nicaragua would
leave them little choice but to return to a full-scale armed
struggle.
   If that happens, Calero said in a telephone interview, much of
the blame should be placed on Congress, which in February rejected
President Reagan's request for additional military aid to the
Contras.
   ``Those who were clamoring to give peace a chance in February
defeated their own purpose by denying us aid,'' Calero said. ``They
took away the strength the resistance needed to keep the
Sandinistas at the negotiating table. It doesn't look like we're
going to be doing much talking now.''

<HEAD>Authorities Free 52 Arrested In Pro-Independence Riots</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police in Tibet have freed 52 people, some of
them Buddhist monks, arrested for taking part in pro-independence
riots held in March in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa, a government
newspaper said today.
   The Guangming Daily said Tibetan authorities decided to show
leniency because the protesters expressed regret and some aided
police investigations by exposing instigators of the March 5 riots.
   The report did not say how many people remained in custody. It
quoted Yuan Chenquan, deputy chief of the Lhasa Public Security
Bureau, as saying most participants in the riots were ``acting
blindly'' and only ``a handful of criminals need further
investigation.''
   The Panchen Lama, Tibetan Buddhism's second-highest official and
a supporter of Chinese policy in Tibet, said in April that 200
people were detained following the riots, which erupted at the end
of a Buddhist religious festival. He said most would be released
after questioning.
   The government has only reported the arrests of four people, in
the slaying of a policeman. The Panchen Lama said five people died
in the violence, while Western travelers put the death toll at
about 24.
   The newspaper said the 52 people released included young monks
from three major monasteries in the Lhasa area and students from
the Tibet Buddhism College. It said that while in custody they
studied the Chinese constitution, criminal law and relevant
regulations.
   The riot began when monks at a prayer festival shouted
pro-independence slogans and threw stones at police. Thousands of
Tibetans joined in and clashed with police throughout the city.
   In September and October, similar rioting left at least 14 dead.
   The rioters, followers of exiled spiritual leader the Dalai
Lama, claim China is illegally occupying the mountain region and
demand an independent Tibet.
   China says Tibet has been an inalienable part of the country for
700 years. Communist troops entered Tibet in 1950 and in 1959 put
down an uprising during which the Dalai Lama and thousands of his
followers fled to exile in India.
   Animosity between Tibetans and non-Tibetan Chinese reached a
peak during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when radical leftists
suppressed Tibetan religion, persecuted worshippers and destroyed
Buddhist temples.
   Since 1976, the Beijing government has guaranteed freedom of
religion and rebuilt some damaged temples, but tensions have
remained.

<TEXT>
   An oil company's image-improvement campaign
could mean an end to the Gulf sign that's marked Lottie Zimmerman's
family business for 70 years.
   Chevron U.S.A. Inc., which owns Gulf, has notified the
80-year-old proprietor that unless she spends an estimated $12,000
to spruce up her gas station, it can't carry Gulf products anymore.
   The word that their pit stop isn't good enough for the corporate
world comes as a shock to some of the regulars at the family-owned
Gonyo's Grocery and Gulf station.
   ``That's kind of sickening,'' said truck driver Louis Walger,
sweating under the ceiling fans while waiting to pay for an
ice-cold beer. ``You don't find these old landmarks anymore. This
is our regular stop.''
   ``It's been here years and years,'' said Rusty Bunch, 66, a
retired neighbor. ``Lottie's got coffee every morning and light
beer in the evening.''
   But Zimmerman, who still offers credit on a promise, said
there's nothing she can do to prevent Chevron from uprooting the
Gulf sign.
   ``They don't want us anymore,'' she said, offering a copy of a
letter from Chevron mandating the improvements by the end of August.
   Unless the station _ considered one of the oldest Gulf stations
in Texas _ is brought up to standards, it will be ``debranded'' by
Chevron, the letter says.
   In a station-image review in late 1987, the Gonyo's Grocery and
Gulf service station was found to be lacking in the number of
gasoline products it supplies. To keep the corporate logo, the
station also needs painted curbs and bumpers, concrete slabs on
both sides of the pumps and a canopy.
   There is no room to add more tanks, and even if the
image-building orders were feasible, the improvements would cost at
least $12,000, said Mike Krolczyk, the local jobber who has
supplied Gonyo's with gasoline for the past 15 years.
   Bill Schroeder, marketing manager for Chevron U.S.A. Inc. in
Houston, said customers expect a certain level of service when they
see a Gulf and Chevron sign, and the image review is an ordinary
part of business.
   ``We're not trying to be heavy-handed or bad guys in this,'' he
said. ``We have a responsibility to protect the integrity of our
name,'' he said.
   Integrity is something Gonyo's usually takes for granted. It's
the nearly extinct kind of place where regular customers can keep a
running bill. Zimmerman keeps the accounts in a worn cigar box on
the counter.
   Zimmerman's grandfather opened the local landmark in 1917 in
this tiny community 32 miles southwest of Houston. The one-room
white wooden structure has a smooth plank floor and ceiling fans.
Plaques on the back wall honor the family business for 25, then 50
years as a Gulf station.
   Buster Zimmerman says that even though his mother's store may be
debranded, it will continue to sell gasoline and stay in Crabb,
sign or no sign.

<HEAD>Dukakis Hangs Onto His Lead But Unfavorable Rating Rises</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis held a lead over
Republican George Bush in a national poll, but the likely
Democratic nominee's unfavorable rating was also rising.
   The CBS News-New York Times poll found Dukakis ahead 47 percent
to 39 percent among the random sample of 947 registered voters
surveyed by telephone last week. The margin of error was plus or
minus three percentage points.
   The lead for the Massachusetts governor was 8 points. In May the
same poll found a 10-point Dukakis lead, 49-39.
   Twenty-eight percent of respondents in the new poll expressed a
favorable view of Dukakis, down from 38 percent in May. Twenty-one
percent expressed an unfavorable view, up from 14 percent. Many
still had no opinion.
   Bush, however, did not benefit from the movement in Dukakis'
rating. The all-but-certain Republican nominee's own favorable
rating was 26 percent, down from 33 percent, and his unfavorable
rating was 31, about the same as his 35 percent in May.
   While voters were uneasy about Dukakis' ability to handle an
international crisis, they expressed similar reservations about
Bush. Thirty-six percent said they would be confident in Bush in a
crisis and 50 percent said they would be uneasy. For Dukakis it was
30 percent confident, 49 percent uneasy.
   Similarly, both men received poor ratings on crime. Twenty
percent said Dukakis was tough enough on crime and 36 percent said
he was not; 23 percent said Bush was tough enough and 49 percent
said he was not.
   On the campaign itself, more respondents thought Bush was
attacking Dukakis than thought Dukakis was going after Bush.
Thirty-five percent said Bush was spending more of his time
explaining his program while 32 percent said he was spending more
time attacking Dukakis; for Dukakis, 50 percent thought he was
mostly explaining and 23 percent said he was attacking Bush.
   Finally, 60 percent said they thought the candidates meant it
when they promised not to raise taxes, but believed the winner
probably will have to raise taxes anyway. Another 32 percent said
the candidates did not mean it when they promised not to increase
taxes.
   The Dukakis lead in the new CBS-Times poll falls between the
results of polls done last month. A Gallup poll late in June found
a 5-point lead for Dukakis, down from a 14-point lead in a Gallup
poll in early June, and an ABC News-Money Magazine poll in late
June had it at 45-42, essentially a dead heat. However, in mid-June
Dukakis led by 12 points in a Washington Post poll and by 15 points
in an NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll.

<TEXT>
   Vietnam's communist government said for
the first time that it is willing to consider taking back large
numbers of refugees who have fled the country, a Western refugee
official said today.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Deputy
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach first revealed
their new position to Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila during
talks in Bangkok on June 20.
   A Thai Foreign Ministry official who declined to be named
confirmed this today.
   The Western official said Vietnam previously had said it would
consider accepting refugees only on ``a case-by-case basis,'' which
the official said ``is their way of saying no.''
   ``Now they are saying they are willing to contemplate
significant numbers of people returning,'' said the official, who
has participated in negotiations on the issue with Indochinese
countries since at least 1982.
   The new position could pave the way for cooperation with
Southeast Asian nations that have complained about a recent surge
of refugees arriving on their shores.
   A United Nations refugee official today said that there were
45,136 so-called Vietnamese boat people in the region's refugee
camps at the end of May, an increase of 11,664 from the previous
year.
   Foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
said in annual talks last week that a repatriation program was one
of the new approaches needed to deal with the influx of Vietnamese
refugees.
   The Western official said that in the earlier stages of the
Vietnamese exodus by boat, which began with the communist victory
in 1975, some groups of people later returned to Vietnam.
   In the past three to four years, however, few returns have been
allowed.
   The Thai Foreign Ministry official said Thach told Siddhi that
Vietnam was ready to hold talks on the refugee issue with Thailand
and other Southeast Asian nations. He said Thach, in an unusually
conciliatory statement, acknowledged that the influx had a
``negative impact on regional countries.''
   A Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokesman said in Hanoi on July 7
that Vietnam was ready to discuss the problem with countries and
international organizations and that it was taking measures to stop
the clandestine exodus.
   The British colony of Hong Kong, host to record numbers of boat
people in recent months, last week announced it had accepted an
invitation from Hanoi for unprecedented talks on the issue.
   Hopes for a resolution of the problem recently have focused on
repatriation because most people fleeing Vietnam are considered
economic migrants, not people subjected to political persecution.
   `The proportion of genuine refugees has never been more than 10
to 20 percent,'' the Western official said.
   Under a proposal by the United States and other countries, the
Southeast Asian nations would relax their tough policies and allow
boat people to land safely. Officials would interview arrivals to
separate economic migrants from political refugees. The refugees
would be resettled and the economic migrants would be returned to
Vietnam.

<HEAD>Western Governors Seek New Ways To Boost Economic Growth</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Western governors, scouting for ways to boost the
West's fortunes, ventured off the beaten path of conference fare to
meet with two gurus of corporate and government change.
   The governors had some traditional topics on their agenda,
including foreign trade, education and job training. But their
visitors Monday warned the governors they must adapt and keep pace
with a volatile and enormously competitive marketplace.
   The conference, with the theme ``Sharpening the West's
Competitive Edge,'' continues here today.
   The guest speakers Monday were Tom Peters, author of ``In Search
of Excellence'' and ``Thriving on Chaos,'' and David Birch, a
professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an
expert on job creation.
   The two were united in their plea for greater efficiency and
inventiveness, less government intrusion in the marketplace and a
willingness to try ``wild and crazy experiments'' at the state
level.
   With Chrysler boss Lee Iacocca's remarks earlier this year that
he had contemplated a hostile takeover of General Motors,
``literally nothing is unthinkable, and `as goes General Motors, so
goes the nation,''' Peters said. ``Literally all bets are off. ...
The rules are gone.''
   Both Peters and Birch said America's largest companies are
laying off people, while most new hires are coming at new,
``niche-seeking'' ventures _ small businesses such as specialty
manufacturers. The smaller firms, with fewer layers of management
and less tradition, are able to develop new products and grab
increasing shares of the market, they said.
   The Fortune 500 firms have eliminated 3.1 million jobs in the
1980s, while more than 12 million jobs were created by businesses
with fewer than 100 employees, said Birch.
   Peters urged state and federal governments to resist the urge to
curb corporate competition, even when it gets scary.
   ``Let the raiders go,'' he said.
   Competition and even raid attempts may be just the ticket to
bring life to aging, lethargic companies, he said.
   ``We need to shape up our big companies and encourage our small
companies,'' Peters said.
   States can ``train, train, train (a workforce that can support
and entice new business), and as soon as you're finished, retrain,
retrain, retrain,'' he said.
   Incentive pay for teachers and public workers is a good idea and
government should demand huge increases in productivity from its
workers, Peters said.
   Gov. Garrey Carruthers of New Mexico urged his fellow governors
to find ``radical, but practical ways'' to do business.
   Colorado Gov. Roy Romer said ``the power of the governor's
office (to bring change) is an illusion'' in some cases, and that
states' chief executives have to deal with entrenched bureaucracies
and union protections.
   ``States change only when the gun is at the temple,'' he said.
   Some problems, such as soaring health care costs, are clearly
beyond a governor's control, said Oregon Gov. Neil Goldschmidt.
   Washington Gov. Booth Gardner, chairman of the Western
Governors' Association of 16 states and three territories, said he
and his colleagues were intrigued by the outsiders' comments.
   ``It really gets your ideas flowing,'' he said. ``It's
stimulating.''

<HEAD>Resistance Leader Says He Quit Because Of Khmer Rouge Assaults</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prince Norodom Sihanouk said today that he resigned
as president of the Cambodian guerrilla coalition because of
assaults on his forces by his supposed allies, the radical
communist Khmer Rouge.
   ``The Khmer Rouge have taken advantage of the withdrawal of
Vietnamese forces west of the Mekong River to step up attacks and
ambushes against the Sihanoukist National Army,'' the former
Cambodian head of state told reporters.
   ``In the last few days I have lost quite a few soldiers and
officers,'' he said. ``The Khmer Rouge want now to liquidate
Sihanoukism.''
   The prince also criticized backers of the coalition ``who favor
the Khmer Rouge outrageously in their distribution of arms.'' He
did not specify who he was talking about, but the Khmer Rouge's
main supplier and supporter is China.
   Sihanouk announced suddenly in Bangkok on Monday that he was
going into exile in France and resigning as president of the
alliance that groups his followers, the Khmer Rouge and former
Premier Son Sann's anti-communist forces.
   It was not clear what effect Sihanouk's sudden resignation, the
latest in a long series of startling moves by the mercurial prince,
would have on his future participation in Cambodian affairs.
   Sihanouk took a ``leave of absence'' as president of the
coalition last summer to conduct talks with Cambodian Prime
Minister Hun Sen, then resigned Jan. 30, accusing his partners of
undermining his negotiations.
   He rescinded the resignation a month later.
   Arriving in France early today, Sihanouk told reporters his
decision to step down was ``irrevocable'' this time.
   The Khmer Rouge, under its feared leader Pol Pot, ruled Cambodia
from 1975-78, when a Vietnamese invasion ended their bloody reign.
   Sihanouk called on France, the United States and other countries
to take steps to prevent ``the return of Pol-Potism in all its
horror'' in Cambodia. He complained that ``certain sponsors of the
coalition continue to exploit the Sihanouk name to permit the Khmer
Rouge to seize power.''
   The prince also said he would not attend multilateral peace
talks scheduled to begin July 25 in Indonesia. He said his son
Prince Norodom Ranariddh would replace him at the talks.
   The talks, the first to include representatives of all the
warring parties, has raised hopes for a political settlement to the
longstanding conflict.
   Last week, Sihanouk met with Secretary of State George P.
Shultz, and senior officials of Japan and Thailand to discuss the
peace process.
   The foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations and their Western partners declared at their annual talks
in Bangkok that Sihanouk should have a central role in the
Indonesia talks and in a future Cambodian government.
   Even after he resigned, U.S. State Deparatment spokeswoman
Phyllis Oakley said the United States believes Sihanouk's
leadership ``represents the best prospect for a successful
resolution of the Cambodian issue and a stable post-settlement
government in Cambodia.''
   Sihanouk ruled Cambodia from 1941 until 1970, when he was
overthrown in a military coup. He was kept under house arrest by
the Khmer Rouge, but in 1982 he joined the Khmer Rouge and Son
Sann's non-communist Khmer People's National Liberation Front in
the coalition recognized by the United Nations as Cambodia's
legitimate government.
   The foreign ministers of Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam met on
Monday in Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital and said they were
committed to a political solution.
   In a joint communique, the ministers said all Vietnamese troops
would leave Cambodia by 1990 or sooner if a settlement is reached.
But they said there must be a guarantee that the Khmer Rouge not
return to power.

<TEXT>
   Vietnam will return to the United
States on Wednesday what it believes are the remains of 25 missing
U.S. servicemen in one of the largest ever turnovers, the U.S.
embassy said today.
   An embassy statement said the remains will be flown from
Vietnam's capital of Hanoi to the U.S. Army Central Identification
Laboratory in Hawaii for identification and return to next-of-kin.
   Remains are usually returned in a simple ceremony at Hanoi's Noi
Bai airport, with a U.S. officials saluting as a U.S. military
honor guard carries the caskets onto a U.S. military transport
plane.
   The turnover would be the fifth since retired Gen. John W.
Vessey, acting as a special presidential envoy, reached an
agreement in Hanoi last August to significantly speed up progess on
the issue.
   The United States was told about the remains during regular
talks in Hanoi last month between technical experts of the two
sides.
   The lack of diplomatic relations between the two countries has
hindered the attempt to account for the fates of nearly 1,800
Americans who remain missing in action. U.S. forces withdrew from
South Vietnam in 1973 after the involvement cost 58,000 American
lives.
   The last return of remains, on April 6, was the largest ever.
Vietnam returned 27 sets of remains it tentatively identified as
those of Americans, and three other sets which it said were those
of ethnic Asians who might possibly be among the missing Americans.

   Maybe the naked truth is that
politicians in Alabama don't care about the nudist vote. Or maybe
they just don't dare to court it.
   Bob Truett, owner of Gymno-Vita Park, a nudist club in St. Clair
County, invited state Democratic and Republican party officials to
speak to his group Sunday.
   State Republicans declined the invitation outright. Instead they
sent campaign literature that arrived late.
   State Democratic Party Executive Director Al LaPierre agreed to
speak _ wearing clothes if he wanted to _ Truett said.
   But LaPierre apparently couldn't bear to show up.
   ``People were standing around the pool waiting for him and he
never showed up,'' Truett said.
   Truett said LaPierre expressed no reservations Thursday when
Truett called to confirm his appearance.
   LaPierre could not be reached for comment.
   Truett said politicians shouldn't ignore his non-partisan club.
After all, 40 to 50 people turned out to hear LaPierre, he said.
   ``There are thousands of nudists across the country,'' Truett
said. ``And many of them vote.''

   Wanted: good homes for $10,000 worth of
shampoo, hair conditioner and bath gel in 97,900 little packets.
   The Fairmont Hotel is getting rid of those packets that grace
many hotel bathrooms as part of its preparations for the Republican
National Convention.
   ``We replaced them ... with superior plastic bottles,'' said
hotel spokesman John De Mers. ``What makes them superior, of
course, is you don't have to rip them open with your teeth and get
shampoo in your mouth. And you can get two or three shampoos out of
one bottle. Plus people love to take them home as souvenirs.''
   De Mers had two questions when the hotel chain's San Francisco
headquarters ordered him to get rid of the packets: how many were
there, and who should they go to?
   It took time to answer the first question.
   ``I got someone to lead me to the shampoo and started counting.
And I counted and I counted and I counted,'' De Mers said Monday.
   It turned out there were 38,500 packets of shampoo, 54,900 of
hair conditioner and 4,500 of bath gel.
   There still was the question of who should get them.
   ``You can give food to the foodless and homes to the homeless,
but who do you give shampoo to?'' he asked.
   So the hotel is holding a Send Us The Suds contest, with Aug. 15
_ the day the Republican National Convention gavels down in the
Superdome _ as the deadline for two-page written entries explaining
how much shampoo, conditioner or bath gel is wanted, and what it's
wanted for.
   ``I would have to say that the more unexpected the reason, the

   A man has been sentenced to four years in prison
after he pleaded guilty to bilking more than 180 Holiday Inn motels
out of $6,000 to clean a mythical soiled suede skirt.
   U.S. District Judge Zita Weinshienk also sentenced Keith W.
Froemming to five years probation on Monday and ordered him to pay
$443.08 in restitution and $100 to a crime victims' fund.
   Froemming, who is from Vail, was accused of mailing letters to
more than 180 Holiday Inn motels contending that a waiter spilled
coffee on his wife's suede skirt. He enclosed a purported cleaning
bill for $30.16.
   Froemming and his associate, Joan Atwell, allegedly received 200
checks worth more than $6,000 from the motels, federal records
indicate.
   Froemming pleaded guilty to two counts of mail-fraud.
   As a condition of probation, Weinshienk ordered Froemming to
attend Gamblers Anonymous meetings and to stay away from Las Vegas,
Nev.
   Atwell was sentenced to four years' probation, and ordered to
pay a $1,000 fine and make restitution in a June 27 sentencing.

<HEAD>U.N. Meeting On Downing Of Iranian Jetliner Delayed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Security Council debate on the U.S.
missile attack on a Iranian passenger jet has been postponed until
Thursday, officials said.
   Diplomatic sources familiar with council procedures said council
President Paulo Nogueira-Batista of Brazil delayed the meeting
originally scheduled for today after consultations with U.S.
Ambassador Vernon A. Walters, Iran's U.N. ambassador, Mohammad
Ja'afar Mahallati, and members of the council.
   The 15-member Security Council was preparing to consider an
Iranian declaration condemning the United States for shooting down
the plane in the Persian Gulf on July 3. Iran said all 290 people
aboard died.
   The United States, Britain and France are expected to use their
veto power as permanent council members to stop any censure
resolution or any demand that the U.S. fleet leave the gulf.
   The sources said Iran had been unable to gain a council majority
to condemn the downing of the jetliner and it would present a
statement, to be followed by a debate, without submitting a
resolution.
   Washington says the USS Vincennes shot down the plane by
accident, believing the jetliner was an attacking warplane.
   The decision to delay the council meeting was made late Monday.
   Earlier Monday, the U.S. government announced an offer of
voluntary compensation to families of victims, but not to the
Iranian government.
   Mahallati, when asked about the U.S. government announcement,
said ``reparation is not sufficient, definitely, because the root
cause of this tragedy and similar tragedies should be removed from
the Persian Gulf.
   ``And it cannot be anything less than withdrawal of U.S. forces
from the Persian Gulf.''
   Requesting the council debate is a turnabout for Iran, which has
boycotted council sessions for years because it claims the council
bows to pressure from Washington and is biased against Iran in the
8-year-old war with Iraq. Iran wants America condemned for murder
in the airliner incident.
   Western diplomats said the United States is expected to argue
that the war and Iran's refusal to accept a truce are at the root
of the problem.
   The United States has been urging the council to impose an arms
embargo on Iran to compel it to accept a cease-fire called for in a
resolution the council passed unanimously on Jul 20, 1987.
   Iraq has agreed to accept a cease-fire, but Iran demands that
Iraq be branded the aggressor before a truce takes effect.
   Nations now on the council are the permanent members _ the
United States, Britain, China, France and Soviet Union _ and
Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Italy, Japan, Nepal, Senegal, West
Germany, Yugoslavia and Zambia.

<TEXT>
   NASA officials said they don't expect
damage to a test booster will delay the tentatively scheduled
September launch of the first space shuttle since the 1986
Challenger disaster.
   The accident will, however, postpone the final test-firing of
Morton Thiokol's redesigned booster from July 25 until the end of
August, officials said.
   The booster was damaged Saturday when a worker testing one of
the motor's three field joints inadvertently switched
pressurization lines and damaged insulation that helps contain
superheated gasses during flight, Morton Thiokol spokesman Rocky
Raab said Monday.
   However, Edward S. Campion of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, said, ``We do not expect it to affect the STS-26
launch schedule.''
   STS-26 is the designation for the first flight of a space
shuttle since the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion destroyed Challenger and
killed seven crew members.
   An 11-member panel from the National Academy of Sciences will
meet next week to evaluate the mishap.
   NASA spokesman David Garrett said the test motor will have to be
partially disassembled for evaluation and possible repairs.
   ``After the rocket is opened up at the joint, we'll have
something more to say,'' said NASA spokesman Ken Atchison in
Washington. ``At this point, our best estimate is that we don't
anticipate a delay.''
   The damaged test rocket already contained severe intentional
flaws designed to determine whether the redesigned joints can
withstand the heat and pressure of launch even in the event of some
failures.
   The test rocket incorporates a new design created after
Challenger exploded after its launch from the Kennedy Space Center.
   The explosion was blamed on a faulty booster joint that allowed
a plume of superhot gas to burn through an O-ring, triggering the
blast.

   Fire swept through a brick apartment building on
the city's West Side this morning, killing seven people, officials
said.
   Police were investigating reports that another person may remain
in the rubble of the fire, which appeared to have started in trash
behind an enclosed wooden back porch at the rear of the building,
fire officials said.
   ``We're interviewing people now to see if we can find any
witnesses,'' said Sgt. John Keane of the police Bomb and Arson Unit.
   Keane said officials aren't yet certain whether the fire, which
spread to an adjacent building, was set.
   Spokesman Jerry Lawrence of the Fire Department said an empty
gasoline can was found, but investigators were not certain whether
it was used to set the blaze.
   Fire Commissioner Louis Galante said there were some indications
of arson.
   ``It started in rubbish behind the back porch and spread up to
the second and third floors,'' he said. ``In the last hour and a
half or two hours, we've had similar fires in the immediate area.''
   A spokeswoman for the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office who
declined to be identified by name said seven bodies had arrived at
the morgue. She said the victims had not been identified, and that
the youngest appeared to be about 12 years old.
   Fire officials say the blaze broke out about 1:30 a.m. EDT and
was put out by 3 a.m.

<TEXT>
   Formulating the strategies of a vast
army may come as second nature to Soviet generals, but one thing
seems to baffle them: single-sliced, plastic-wrapped American
cheese.
   Col. Gen. Dmitri A. Grinkevich, the chief of staff of Soviet
ground forces, paid a visit Monday to the U.S. Military Academy as
part of a Soviet delegation that has been visiting American
military installations.
   Grinkevich, one of the highest-ranking officers in the Soviet
army, is the highest-ranking Soviet officer ever to visit West
Point, according to Maj. Bruce Bell, spokesman for the academy.
   During his four-hour visit, Grinkevich had lunch with about
1,600 cadets in Washington Hall, West Point's mess hall. He sat at
a table with five cadets, several of whom spoke Russian, Bell said.
   When faced with a single slice of cheese wrapped in plastic, the
Soviet military man apparently had trouble, Bell said. Cadet
Jeannie Koch, who was sitting at the same table, had to show him
how to unwrap it.
   ``It appeared as if he had never had to unwrap singularly
wrapped cheese before,'' Bell said.
   Grinkevich is part of the delegation headed by Soviet Chief of
Staff Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev that ended a weeklong U.S. tour
Monday.
   Bell said the ``Soviet general seemed very warm and engaging but
he didn't make make any comments whatsoever'' about West Point or
the cadets.

<TEXT>
   A 24-hour ``blue flu'' epidemic that idled
nearly a fourth of the city's 1,350 police officers was over today
with the city still refusing to recognize a police union for
collective bargaining.
   Police Chief Warren Woodfork said streets were probably safer
than usual because of 60 state troopers who were brought into the
city for patrol duty.
   Although the Police Association of New Orleans disavowed any
connection with the absences, the union's president said job stress
was a logical extension of the city's refusal to bargain with the
group and raise salaries.
   Officers began straggling back to work for the start of their
late-evening shift Monday, said police department spokesman John
Bryson. ``They have returned to work. We're back up to normal
strength,'' he said.
   He said the 334 officers who called in sick beginning late
Sunday represented 24.7 percent of the department's 1,350 or so
employees.
   Woodfork said his department could continue to maintain security
in the city of 500,000 even if police union members carry out a
threat to stop work during next month's Republican National
Convention.
   Woodfork said there were no immediate plans to discipline
officers who called in sick. Mayor Sidney Barthelemy, who has
refused to recognize the union, was out of town Monday and could
not be reached for comment.

   Survivors of the terrorist attack aboard
the cruise ship City of Poros described how a slim young man got up
from his deck chair, pulled out an automatic weapon and sprayed
bullets at dozens of European tourists.
   Terrified passengers screamed in panic. Some hit the deck,
others ran for shelter.
   ``A thin man in white with a dark complexion and dark hair
jumped up from his seat as if he'd had an electric shock and
started yelling in what sounded like Arabic,'' Andre Gelia, a
55-year-old Frenchman, told reporters after the attack Monday.
   ``He took a submachine gun out of the backpack at his feet and
started shooting blindly. The first burst went into the air and the
next hit the passengers,'' said Gelia, who among 177 French
tourists on the ship.
   Gelia said at least 10 people were wounded in the legs.
   ``Then he (the gunman) said a few more words in Arabic, took out
one or two hand grenades out of the backpack and tossed them,''
Gelia said. ``That's all I remember.''
   At least 11 people were killed and 98 were wounded in the
attack. Survivors said there were three gunmen, one of whom
appeared to be wearing a sock for a mask.
   There were 471 passengers on the City of Poros, most sitting on
the sun deck or in the saloon immediately below when the terrorists
opened fire at 8:40 p.m.
   When the shooting began, the 370-ton Greek-owned cruise ship was
heading to Piraeus from the island of Aegina after a one-day cruise
of the islands. A crew of 22 was on board.
   ``We were in the back of the boat when we heard a loud bang that
I thought had been a collision,'' said British bank manager John
Whittome, who was touring Greece with his wife, Celia, and 12 of
her high school students.
   ``Then there was a second powerful explosion and the roof caved
in. There was panic as people tried to get off, they grabbed life
jackets and were jumping into the sea,'' said Whittome.
   Whittome, his wife and the girls slid down ropes into the warm
waters of the Saronic Gulf.
   ``The girls were very brave. They helped each other, and other
passengers into the water. It was a terrifying experience for
them,'' said Mrs. Whittome, who teaches ancient Greek and Latin.
   Her husband said they all swam 300 feet to a nearby tug that
picked them up and took them to Piraeus. The group later flew back
to Britain.
   The hand grenades thrown by the attackers triggered a fire
aboard the ship that trapped some passengers in the saloon beneath
red hot sheets of metal. Black smoke poured from the ship as the
captain radioed for help.
   ``It was a hellish scene...one of the terrorists ran downstairs
to the saloon firing as he went and there was fire everywhere...he
seemed to be chasing us,'' said a Swedish tourist, who asked not to
be identified by name.
   A French couple in the saloon said they heard ``a few dull thuds
and the saw the roof collapsing.
   ``We also heard the rat-a-tat sound made by machine guns and we
rushed up the stairs to get off the ship. Someone gave us life
jackets and we jumped,'' said 23-year-old Sylvie Luser of Lilles,
France.
   ``I still can't comprehend what happened,'' said her husband,
Didier.
   In addition to the tug, two Greek navy vessels, coast guard
patrol boats, a passenger ferry and several pleasure craft picked
up survivors, Merchant Marine Ministry officials said.
   The one-day cruise to the islands of Hydra, Poros and Aegina is
one of the most popular excursions for foreign tourists visiting
Greece. The City of Poros was one of four Greek-owned cruise ships
that make the trip every day.

<TEXT>
   Superpower talks on reducing long-range nuclear
arsenals resumed today after a seven-week break with both sides
identifying at least two major hurdles toward completing a draft
treaty.
   Before the opening session, U.S. chief delegate Max Kampelman
reaffirmed Washington's stand that a pact that would halve each
side's stockpile ``should not be held hostage'' to limits sought by
Moscow on U.S. plans for a large-scale space defense against
ballistic missiles.
   The other chief source of disagreement centers on Soviet
insistence on limiting sea-launched cruise missiles.
   Asked whether negotiators see a possible fifth superpower summit
or the end of Ronald Reagan's presidency in January as a deadline,
Kampelman told reporters talks will ``continue no matter who is
president and no matter who the leader of the Soviet Union is.
   ``I don't think important issues should be governed by the
calendar,'' he said. ``If it takes longer, fine. If it takes
shorter, fine.''
   Kampelman, chief Soviet negotiator Alexei Obukhov and their full
delegations met for about two hours at the U.S. mission to launch
the 10th round of Geneva talks since March 1985. The session then
recessed for the day, and no date was immediately announced for the
next session.
   The ninth round of talks recessed before the May 29-June 2
summit between Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, which produced only
slight progress toward a long-range nuclear forces treaty.
   The superpower leaders then ordered negotiators to continue
``energetically and purposefully.'' No end date has been announced
for this new round.
   The chief negotiators hinted that a breakthrough is not in sight.
   ``Don't look for drama,'' Kampelman told reporters Monday.
``We're at a stage now where hard work is required rather than
drama.''
   Obukhov warned after his arrival Sunday: ``We do not want to
lose momentum.''
   While both negotiators said the talks have come ``a long way,''
Kampelman also noted, ``Much that is important still remains to be
solved.''
   He said a draft could still be completed under the Reagan
administration and voiced hope the new round will, ``at the very
least, significantly narrow the differences between us.''
   Both sides agree that the proposed Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty should cut each side's stocks over seven years to an overall
limit of 6,000 nuclear warheads and 1,600 launchers, such as heavy
bombers and land-based intercontinental missiles.
   Some details of monitoring compliance with a future pact are
also settled, but both negotiators stressed more work was needed.
   Obukhov told reporters progress ``now depends primarily'' on
resolving disputes over U.S. plans to develop a space-based missile
defense system, called the Strategic Defense Initiative, and on
limiting the deployment of long-range sea-launched cruise missiles.
   ``We reject the Soviet attempts to use these negotiations to
have us end our Strategic Defense Initiative,'' Kampelman said.
   For sea-launched cruise missiles, the Soviets have proposed
limits and called for anti-cheating measures including inspections
of warships.
   Washington has balked, saying the weapons cannot be reliably
detected.
   On Monday, U.S. negotiator Steven Hanmer called the Soviet
verification proposals ``totally impractical'' and said current
prospects for resolving the issue are dim.
   Last December, Reagan and Gorbachev signed a treaty scrapping
all intermediate-range nuclear forces. Both countries ratified that
pact shortly before the Moscow summit.

   The pilot of the helicopter that plucked
three convicts out of a New Mexico prison flew the same aircraft in
the movie ``Rambo III,'' a friend says.
   Charles Bella, 43, of El Paso, who told authorities his
Aerospatiale Gazelle was hijacked before Monday's failed escape
attempt, would not have voluntarily helped the inmates, said Tony
Mobley.
   ``Anybody who knows him knows how hard he works,'' said Mobley,
who has known Bella 16 years. ``No one would believe he would risk
everything he's worked for for someone who got theirs the easy way.
I would stake my life on it.''
   Two inmates were captured during a nearly two-hour chase that
followed the escape, and the third was apprehended early today,
authorities said. Police also arrested a woman who was in the
aircraft when it landed in a yard at the Penitentiary of New Mexico
near Santa Fe.
   Bella told his wife, Carrol, that the woman forced him to fly to
the prison by putting a gun to his head and handcuffing him to the
control stick.
   Bella was being held at the Santa Fe County Jail while
authorities checked his story, officials said. Mrs. Bella said New
Mexico authorities told her he probably would be released.
   She said her husband told him in a phone conversation Monday
that he was ``fine but mad.''
   Bella owns two helicopters and uses them in his charter
business, Bear Helicopters, Mrs. Bella said. The El Paso business
mainly serves TV news crews and real estate businesses, she said.
   Bella thought he was being hired to fly some people over a
prospective land purchase in New Mexico, his wife said.
   ``He met this supposed secretary at the Santa Fe airport and she
evidently held a gun to his head,'' she said.
   Bella flew stunts in ``Rambo III'' and the movie ``Extreme
Prejudice,'' Mobley said.
   In ``Rambo III,'' the Gazelle, modified to look like a Soviet
Hind helicopter, is shot down by Rambo, played by Sylvester
Stallone.
   A picture of Bella standing next to Stallone in front of the
Gazelle hangs on the living room wall of Bella's home.

<HEAD>Black Families Move Into South Boston Project Without Incident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two black families have become the first black
tenants in 10 years at a public housing project in South Boston,
the scene of racial violence when public schools were integrated in
the 1970s.
   The families moved Monday into the Mary Ellen McCormack housing
project and were greeted by Cathy Flynn, wife of Mayor Raymond
Flynn. Police kept bystanders and reporters at a distance during
the move, which took place without incident.
   Elizabeth Clinkscales and Bessie Payne and their families stayed
in their apartments Monday and would not comment.
   Ms. Clinkscales and Ms. Payne, both 36, met with reporters on
Saturday and expressed a desire to begin a stable life in their
apartments.
   ``It will take some courage to do it but I'm just doing it
because I'm a decent human being that needs to live somewhere,''
said Ms. Clinkscales, who lives with her 19-year-old daughter and
4-year-old grandson.
   ``I'm no pioneer,'' said Ms. Payne. ``I'm just almost a homeless
person _ and I don't like that feeling at all. I'm looking forward
to making a new home and getting my life straightened out again.''
   Ms. Payne has a 13-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter.
   The families were given three-bedroom apartments by the Boston
Housing Authority after they were evicted from other apartments.
   Their move is not part of an ongoing integration plan affecting
31 of 69 public housing projects, including the 1,000-tenant
McCormack.
   The plan by Flynn and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development seeks to provide subsidized housing for an estimated
500 black families passed over for placement in South Boston and
Charlestown projects since 1983.
   City officials hope successful implementation of the plan will
stall a lawsuit by minority groups.
   Many residents watching the families move in to McCormack felt
the black families would not encounter problems.
   ``I really think the press has blown it out of proportion,''
said 18-year-old Kelly Manion. ``We'll get along together. In fact,
it just might be good for the people living here.''

   A man convicted of masterminding a fake
plane crash during a heavy snowstorm has been sentenced to one year
in a federal prison and ordered to undergo psychiatric evaluation.
   The sentence given Monday to Mark Blair ``sends a strong message
that it's a serious crime to cry wolf,'' said U.S. Attorney Richard
Wiebusch.
   The radio report sparked a search last Jan. 8 that cost $50,000
and involved as many as 100 people, 20 aircraft and six police
agencies. They looked for a downed jet with three dead passengers
and a badly injured pilot.
   U.S. Circuit Judge Hugh Bownes said ``more than minimal planning
was involved'' in faking the crash during the storm, in which
visibility was one-half mile, temperatures were in the teens and
nine inches of snow fell.
   Blair ``must have known that (the fake report) would set off a
massive ground and air search,'' Bownes said.
   Blair, 29, was convicted in May of making a false report to the
government, a crime punishable by a fine and up to five years'
prison.
   Although Blair said he was not surprised by the sentence, he
insisted he is innocent and will appeal. Bownes declined to set
bail for Blair pending appeal.
   At the trial, Blair testified that he couldn't have committed
the hoax because he was asleep and wasn't aware a plane had been
reported down.
   But one of his neighbors testified that he heard the sound of a
two-way radio through Blair's window and a voice crying out for
help.
   David Webster, a Navy reservist and Delta Airlines pilot,
testified that he and his crew tracked the voice of a man who
talked sporadically and said that he was loosing blood, was chilled
and weak, and that at least one person in his plane was dead.
   Webster, 39, testified that his crew was overcome with emotion
when the man said he heard the Navy plane overhead.
   ``People in my plane were screaming and yelling .... I got tears
in my eyes thinking, `We're going to get this guy out,''' Webster
said.
   Bownes recommended that Blair be jailed at the Federal
Correctional Institution in Butner, N.C., a prison with extensive
psychiatric facilities.
   Blair also was sentenced to two years' probation, during which
he will be required to receive mental health counseling.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan's decision to pay families of
the 290 people killed in the U.S. downing of an Iranian airliner
met fresh resistance on Capitol Hill today, with some lawmakers
saying the gesture is premature and politically touchy.
   ``The United States of America is not guilty of anything''
except protecting the lives of American sailors, Rep. Gerald
Solomon, R-N.Y., said on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show.
   He contended that the Iranian government deliberately provoked
the U.S. cruiser Vincennes into firing on the jetliner and said,
``I don't think there's any question this was a provoked attack. ...
   ``It was an act of martyrdom by the Iranian government to bring
humiliation on the United States and we should not be a part of
that at this time,'' Solomon said.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., concurred.
   ``It's too early. There are many serious questions that need to
be resolved ... before we would contemplate compensation. We should
also expect some progress on the hostage situation,'' he said on
ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''
   ``I don't see why there's this rush to judgment.''
   Their comments echoed those of other members of Congress who
said after Monday's announcement that the distinction may be
largely lost on the U.S. electorate, which harbors long-simmering
resentment of Iran stemming from the seizure of the U.S. embassy in
1979, from its sponsorship of international terrorism and from the
continued holding of Americans in Lebanon.
   Reagan's request ``has some problems,'' added Rep. Tony Coelho,
D-Calif., the chief Democratic vote counter in the House, who said
he personally opposed the idea. ``I don't understand why they're
trying to move it along.''
   But Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., appearing with Solomon, responded
that compensating the families of those who died is ``the fair and
the just and the right thing to do ... we're not admitting any
guilt.''
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., also appearing on ``Good Morning
America,'' said Reagan's offer ``distinguishes us from others. ...
It's the sign of a compassionate and strong nation.''
   The disagreement spread even to two former hostages in Iran, who
appeared on CBS-TV's ``This Morning.''
   Morehead Kennedy suggested forming a mixed claims commission to
handle U.S. claims against Iran as well as that nation's claims
against the United States.
   Such a procedure would establish a connection with the nine
Americans held hostage in Beirut, he suggested.
   ``I don't think that we should go this guilt trip by
ourselves,'' Kennedy said. ``There is a very culpable Iranian guilt
here.''
   Another victim of the U.S. Embassy takeover in Iran, Bruce
Laingen, said however that he agrees with Reagan. ``This is a clear
case where we have a humanitarian obligation to offer compensation
to the victims,'' he said.
   Reagan's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said in Monday's
announcement that Reagan was motivated by humanitarian concerns and
was acting out of charity rather than obligation. He made it clear
that payments were to go to victims' families and not to the Tehran
government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   A Navy investigative team is still looking into the incident, in
which the Vincennes fired on the airliner after mistaking it for a
warplane.
   Numerous questions about Reagan's decision remained unanswered,
including how much money would be paid to the families, how contact
would be made in the absence of formal diplomatic relations between
the two countries and just what legal authority would be used to
make the payments.
   A State Department official, briefing reporters on condition of
anonymity, said it is not clear whether a flat amount will be paid
for each victim or whether the age, number of dependents and
earnings of the victims will be taken into account in assessing
compensation.
   It also was unclear whether the gesture would require
congressional legislation. Congressional leaders assumed that the
White House would seek House and Senate approval out of a desire
for support for its policy decision, if not out of a need for money
to pay the families.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said offering payments to the
survivors of the victims would be ``a voluntary act committed by a
nation that is both generous and genuinely regretful'' of the
incident. He said he expected quick action once Reagan formally
makes a request of Congress.
   ``If the president is satisfied (that payments are warranted), I
would imagine the Congress would be satisfied,'' Wright said.
Leading members of the congressional foreign policy and defense
committees also have spoken out in favor of making such payments.
   ``We are a just and generous people,'' said Sen. Arlen Specter,
R-Pa., who said the payments should go forward ``on basic grounds
of fairness and decency.''
   Fitzwater said the money would be channeled through some
third-party organization or intermediary, such as the Red Crescent,
an arm of the Red Cross. He acknowledged that the United States
still has not determined how to verify the identities of the dead
or survivors who will likely make compensation claims.
   All but 38 of the Iran Air passengers were from Iran. The others
were from India, Italy, Pakistan, Turkey, Yugoslavia and the United
Arab Emirates.
   A national Washington Post-ABC News poll last week found that 61
percent of those surveyed opposed the idea of paying compensation.
That finding appeared to take on substantial weight just four
months before congressional elections.
   Some lawmakers linked the payment issue with the question of
U.S. hostages who continue to be held in Lebanon, apparently by
radical elements with ties to Iran. McCain said the hostages should
be freed as part of any compensation deal.
   But Wright said that would amount to ransoming them, and
Fitzwater added: ``I don't think there are very many congressmen
who want it to appear we're doing business with Iran over the
hostages.''
   Fitzwater said the payments would be what lawyers call ``ex
gratia'' _ made voluntarily without admitting guilt or liability.
Under international law, nations have no legal liability for
damages caused as a result of war or hostilities.
   But some administration advisers have been concerned that the
United States not be likened to the Soviet Union, which refused to
make compensation after shooting down a Korean Air Lines passenger
plane over the Sea of Japan in 1983, according to congressional
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.

   Iraqi forces today pushed Iran's army out
of the last major pockets of Iraqi territory it held along the
southern border, the official Iraqi radio said.
   Iran said its warplanes bombed Iraqi positions in the southern
Zubaidat region of Iraq, but did not say the Iraqi forces had
regained control of the area. Iran also announced its forces were
pulling back from positions in Iraq's northern mountains.
   Iraq's presidential guards spearheaded the offensive to retake a
chunk of land in the Zubaidat region along the border with Iran,
according to war communiques broadcast by Iraqi radio.
   The offensive began just after dawn and the Zubaidat area ...
 ... five missions over the Zubaidat region.
   IRNA also said Iranian troops had retreated from the town of
Halabja in northeastern Iraq to new ``defensive positions.'' The
retreat was designed to ``ma more secure approaches,'' the  ...
   In Baghdad, there was no official confirmation of an assault on
Halabja, but military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said an attack has been expected for weeks.
   Iran seized Halabja, in the Kurdish area of Iraq, last March. It
later accused Iraq of unleashing a chemical weapons offensive
against the town, killing 5,000 people.
   Iraqi communiques concentrated on the retaking of the Zubaidat
region, which fell to Iran several years ago. Neither country
confirmed how much territory Iran held in the area.
   The communiques said an unspecified number of Iranians were
either killed or wounded in today's battle east of Amara, which is
180 miles southeast of the Iraqi capital of Baghdad.
   It is the latest in a series of battlefield defeats for Iran
since the Iraqis took back the Faw peninsula on April 18.
   The communique announcing that the Zubaidat area had been
recaptured was widely believed written by President Saddam Hussein.
He has written them in the past and the phrasing in today's latest
report mirrored his style.
   It reiterated Iraq's readiness to end the war under terms of a
U.N. Security Council's Resolution 598. The resolution calls for an
immediate cease-fire and an independent inquiry into which side
started the 8-year-old war.

<TEXT>
   A cystic fibrosis victim who became the
nation's first living heart donor has died of respiratory failure,
14 months after receiving a heart and lungs transplant at Johns
Hopkins Hospital.
   Clinton House, 29, who donated his heart to another man after he
received a heart-lung transplant, died while awaiting a second
transplant, his cardiologist, Dr. Thomas Traill, said Monday.
   House's respiratory failure

   his rejection of the
transplanted lungs, the cardiologist said.
   Meanwhile, John Couch, 39, of Yardley, Pa., who received House's
original heart, continues to do well, Traill said. Couch had
suffered from congestive heart failure.
   House received the heart and lungs of a brain-dead accident
victim in a 17-hour operation on May 10-11, 1987. He needed a lung
transplant, but doctors did a heart-lung transplant because the
procedure is safer.
   House donated his healthy heart to Couch in the nation's first
so-called domino donor transplant, hospital spokesman Phil Kibak
said.
   House ``had a good summer last year, a good fall,'' said Traill.
``But from about that onwards, he began to do progessively less
well because of the system rejection.''
   House had been waiting since February for a second double
transplant, Traill said.
   Couch ``was sad and distressed,'' by House's death, said Traill.
``It didn't come as a complete surprise to (Couch), because he knew
Mr. House had been doing poorly. They had been keeping in touch.''
   Cystic fibrosis causes production of a thick, sticky mucus that
clogs the lungs and digestive system. It is the nation's most
common inherited disease, afflicting about 30,000 Americans, and
usually kills victims by the time they reach their mid-20s.

<TEXT>
   Sony Corp. said today it will begin marketing
VHS-format video cassette recorders in the United States this fall.
   A Sony official said the electronics giant began marketing
VHS-format VCRs in Europe in May and will begin selling them in
Japan July 21.
   Sony has produced and marketed only Beta-format VCRs in the
past, and the official said Sony will continue to market
Beta-format VCRs at home and abroad in fiscal 1988, which ends next
March 31.
   Sony's decision to manufacture VHS-format VCRs capped a long
rivalry between its Beta system, introduced in 1975, and the
incompatible VHS standard, introduced a year later by the Japan
Victor Corp. (JVC).
   Since their introduction, the number of companies selling Beta
machines has declined while VHS models have grown in popularity,
currently accounting for an estimated 90 percent of the world
market.
   Analysts have said Sony was not active enough in soliciting
other companies to join it in making and marketing the Beta system,
and was late in responding to consumer demand.

<TEXT>
   For the second consecutive weekend, Eddie
Murphy's ``Coming To America'' was the box office leader while
Disney's ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' was second.
   The weekend box office saw four debut movies enter the Top 10
list, three of them sequels: ``Arthur 2: On The Rocks,'' the
follow-on to ``Arthur''; ``Short Circuit 2,'' reprising the tale of
a friendly robot and ``Phantasm II,'' a horror revival.
   The teen-oriented comedy ``License to Drive'' was the new effort.
   ``Coming To America,'' starring Murphy in a romantic comedy lead
that reverses his rough-talking characters of previous movies,
collected $13.2 million.
   Disney's ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' a fascinating mix of
animation and live action, took in $11.5 million to bring its take
to $54 million in just three weeks.
   In third place was ``Arthur 2: On The Rocks,'' with Dudley Moore
reviving his dipsomaniac millionaire just when comic portrayals of
drunkeness in the media are coming under fire. The movie earned
more than $5.1 million.
   ``Big,'' starring Tom Hanks, also earned about $5.1 million for
fourth place, while ``Bull Durham'' was fifth with $3.9 million.

disregard his driver's license test failure and take a beautiful
girl on a date in a vintage Cadillac, earned $3.8 million for a
sixth place finish in its debut week.
   Moviegoers chipped in $3.8 million to see ``Short Circuit 2,'' a
movie about the further adventures of the curious robot Number Five
and his inventor.
   ```Crocodile' Dundee II,'' earned $3.2 million for eighth place.
   ``Phantasm II,'' featuring the shiny orb that attacks its
victims with a variety of weapons, brought in $3 million for ninth
place, followed by ``The Great Outdoors,'' with $2.6 million.
   Here are the top films for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations Co., with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater

   A mudslide in a shallow mine killed
eight prospectors and trapped at least eight others while they were
digging for gold in the town of Taraza, the mayor said today.
   Rogelio Osorio, mayor of Taraza, said the accident occurred
Monday afternoon when soil softened by rain slid into the shaft and
enveloped the prospectors.
   Police said they rescued one man and pulled eight bodies out of
the mud, but that at least eight others were trapped and believed
dead.
   Last week, 10 miners died in a similar accident near Taraza, a
town north of Bogota.
   The mayor said about 2,000 farmers had come to the area in
search of gold in mines unprotected by safety measures.

   Under a state law custom-written for Lyndon
Johnson in 1959, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas could run for
re-election to the Senate and for vice president at the same time.
   Johnson, who was John F. Kennedy's running mate, won both races
in 1960 and later became the first president from Texas. But
Johnson's dual victories cost his party a Senate seat they have yet
to win back.
   Bentsen is a heavy favorite to win Senate re-election over
Republican challenger Beau Boulter, a West Texas congressman. But
if Bentsen becomes vice president, his Senate seat would be
declared open in January, and Texas Gov. Bill Clements, a
Republican, would appoint an interim replacement.
   A replacement to fill out the six-year term would be picked by
the voters in a spring special election, the same route Republican
John Tower used in 1961 to replace Johnson. That wild race drew 70
candidates. Tower and Bill Blakley, a Democrat appointed as interim
senator by then-Democratic Gov. John Connally, advanced to a
runoff, which Tower won.
   The Democrats could never beat Tower. He retired in 1984, and
Republican Phil Gramm won the seat.
   Boulter, Bentsen's Senate race opponent, has said it would be
``greedy'' for Bentsen to run for two jobs.
   ``He's making it look like the Senate is unimportant,'' Boulter
said.

   Jesse Jackson isn't making life easy for Michael
Dukakis.
   Dukakis and his aides undoubtedly hoped next week's Democratic
National Convention would allow the Massachusetts governor to bask
_ solo _ in the warmth of a prime-time party unity festival, the
next step toward a showdown with George Bush in the fall.
   That was until Jackson decided to campar the
vice presidential nomination, to arrange a grand arrival in this
convention city and encourage a few thousand of his closest friends
to join him and deign arduously foride the proposed bare-bones platform
crafted by
the Dukakis forces.
   Jackson was asked a few days ago whether he was worried about
stealing some of Dukakis' thunder.
   ``It has nothing to do with thunder,'' was his taunting reply.
``Mr. Dukakis had no intention of bringing any thunder to Atlanta.''
   Dukakis today stole some of Jackson's thunder. According a
well-placed Democratic Party source, Dukakis will announce later
today that he has selected Sen. Lloyd BWe intend to have an effective,
informative convention that
would inspire our nation, unify our party and take us to victory,''
he said Monday.
   But he also said that his actions in the future will be
influenced by the treatment his candidacy and platform proposals
receive.
   ``The conclusion of those steps will in some measure determine
what our fall activities will be,'' he said.
   Jackson has an uncanny ability to remain on the stage long after
other politicians would have departed. He remained a campaigner in
the primary season long after a conventional politician would have
run out of money and called it quits.
   
   He campaigned assiduously for the vice presidential nomination,
while others who want it as much or more practically blush anytime
the subject is mentioned within their earshot. Who else in American
politics would announce one day that he had decided whether he
would accept an offer to join Dukakis on the ticket, but wouldn't
tell anyone what his decision was?
   And who else would describe as ``unknown quantities'' all the
other contenders for the vice presidential nomination?
   His platform issues will be debated on national television next
week if it goes that far. He will speak during prime time on the
second night of the convention. His name will be entered into
nomination for president the following night.
   And it is conceivable that his name could be put into nomination
for vice president on the final night in a final, symbolic clash
with Dukakis.
   That, of course, would give him the chance to go to the podium
once more, perhaps to bestow his blessing at last on Dukakis and
his running mate.
   But even now, Jackson is making sure the spotlight doesn't turn
away from him when the convention ends.
   He declared on Monday _ before the choice of Bentsen became
known _ that if Dukakis offered him second place on the ticket ``I
would accept it.'' He said he assured Dukakis' emissary Paul
Brountas that he would be a loyal vice president.
   But Jackson said that if he were not chosen, he would expect
further discussions with Dukakis before defining what role he will
play in the fall campaign.

   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci today
promised ``appropriate action,'' including contract suspensions, if
the ongoing Pentagon bribery probe turns up new evidence that some
contracts may be tainted.
   Carlucci said he lifted his July 1 suspensions of nine military
programs because a Navy review ``did not indicate that any of the
current contracts in the affected programs are tainted.''
   The Pentagon is beginning actions to ban two companies and three
individuals from doing further business with the Defense Department.
   Carlucci told the Senate Armed Services Committee that ``if
other official information becomes available during the course of
the investigation which warrants new concern regarding these or
other contracts, the department will evaluate it and take any
appropriate action.''
   He outlined actions the Pentagon may take, including rescinding,
terminating or suspending contracts, or fining individuals.
   The decisions arose from the criminal investigation of
allegations that defense contractors and consultants bribed
Pentagon officials for contracting details that could be vital in
winning contracts worth billions of dollars.
   Carlucci also said he is writing to the chief executives of the
top 200 defense contractors, ``urging them to ensure stringent
management controls on the use of consultants and to avoid improper
business practices.''
   The acquisition system has problems, Carlucci admitted. ``There
are defects in how America equips its forces,'' he said.
   The current investigation is a good reason to correct those
flaws, he said. ``Even if the probe reveals no more than the
misdeeds of a few greedy lawbreakers, I still want to move forward
now, in cooperation with Congress, to remedy flaws in our system,
regardless of whether those flaws are related to the Justice
investigation.''
   The companies suspended Monday were Varian Continental of Dallas
and Acquisition Control of Alexandria, Va. The three individuals
were former Navy procurement officer Mark Saunders, consultant
Thomas E. Muldoon and Varian official Joe Bradley.
   Carlucci's July 1 announcement of contract suspensions had come
in the wake of congressional calls for strong action. But the
suspensions were surrounded by confusion from the beginning, with
Pentagon officials unable to say exactly what work was covered and
when the actions took effect.
   Contractors, meanwhile, said they were not formally notified so
they continued to work on the contracts.
   The contracts were with Litton Industries, Unisys, TRW, ITT,
Continental Electronics, Loral Terracom, Canadian Commercial,
Hughes Aircraft and Raytheon Corp.
   Charles Bowsher, head of the congressional General Accounting
Office, told the Armed Services Committee on Monday that quick
actions should not be undertaken while the criminal investigation
is under way.
   ``It might be better to let the investigative process work,''
said Bowsher. Later, he said, if there are indictments, contracts
could be suspended. Should there be convictions, companies and
individuals could then be barred from doing business, he said.
   All three men suspended Monday from doing Pentagon business have
been identified in FBI affidavits as having allegedly traded in
inside contract information.
   The FBI said Saunders, a former Navy procurement officer who was
convicted of stock trading on insider Navy information in 1982, was
receiving inside contract data from George Stone, his Navy
successor. The bureau said it ``believes that Saunders is paying
Stone for this information.''
   The Navy has begun actions to suspend Stone without pay, the
Pentagon said Monday.
   Bradley is vice president for marketing of Varian Continental;
he has been placed on administrative leave. Muldoon is a former
Unisys employee who set up his own consulting firm in Washington.
   An FBI affidavit said Muldoon paid Saunders $4,000 out of an
$8,000 monthly retainer from Litton Industries in exchange for
contract information.
   In his congressional testimony, Bowsher noted that past defense
buildups, during World War II and the Korean War, were also
tarnished by procurement problems.
   ``History shows that when too much money is pumped into the
acquisition system over a relatively short period of time, we will
have problems,'' he said.
   But in contrast to past cases, which generally involved
lower-level people, ``one thing that distinguishes (this case) is
it's fairly high up,'' Bowsher said.
   ``The thing that discourages me the most is that some very
senior people might be involved,'' he said.
   Besides the possible criminal charges, said Bowsher, another
problem is likely to arise from the Reagan administration military
buildup.
   ``I think the other shoe will probably fall soon, namely, many
big cost overruns,'' he told the committee.
   ``I suspect the Stealth airplane program, the Navy shipbuilding
programs and the other programs which have to be stretched because
of budget constraints will all result in very large cost increases
that the Congress will have to finance,'' he said.
   ``Stretch out'' refers to a Pentagon practice, adopted when
budgets are tight, of buying the same number of weapons but doing
it over a longer period. Intervening price hikes frequently end up
increasing the overall cost.

   Playboy Clubs in Des Moines and Iowa closed at the end of April.
   The first Playboy Club was opened in Chicago in 1960 by Playboy
magazine publisher Hugh Hefner, according to Karen Ziffra,

   The decision to close the Lansing club coincided with the Hilton

   For most of its life, the Playboy Club was a $25-a-year club
geared to males, said Bill Brook, the hotel's food and beverage

opened to the general public.
   ``It's the end of an era,'' Brooks said. ``It was a glorious

   A dispute erupted at a coin-operated laundry
after a customer complained of losing 75 cents in a machine, and
nine people suffered minor gunshot wounds, police said.
   Three people were arrested in connection with the incident
Monday night at a laundry in Harlem.
   According to Officer Peter O'Donnell, a police spokesman, the
incident started when Nicole Nixon, 18, argued with a laundry
attendant after losing money in a machine. Miss Nixon was hit in
the head and was taken to Harlem Hospital, he said.
   About an hour later, police said, Miss Nixon's mother,
stepfather, 10-year-old brother and boyfriend showed up, and
another dispute erupted. One or two people fired an undetermined
number of shots, he said.
   Those wounded included Miss Nixon's relatives and boyfriend, and
some bystanders on the street, according to Sgt. Ed Burns, another
police spokesman.

<HEAD>Bylines Withheld at Post to Protest Lack of Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reporters, artists, photographers and
columnists for The Washington Post withheld their bylines from
today's editions of the newspaper to protest the two years they
have gone without a labor contract with the company.
   The last contract between Post management and the
Washington-Baltimore Newspaper Guild expired July 9, 1986.
   In a flier distributed in the newsroom, Lew Diuguid, head of the
bargaining committee of the Post unit of the union, accused the
Post of ``failure to bargain in good faith.'' The guild said it
planned a two-day byline strike.
   Union leaders say there is a two-tier pay system which
established a lower minimum scale for those hired after 1976,
causing what they say is pay discrimination by race and sex.
   The union also opposes what it says is a ``pattern of force-outs
of `expensive' senior employees.''
   In a statement, Executive Editor Benjamin C. Bradlee and
Managing Editor Leonard Downie Jr. said, ``We all want a new
contract between the Post and the guild'' and that the Post ``has
now signed contracts with every one of the other 10 unions''
represented at the newspaper.
   The statement denied existence of a two-tier wage system and
said the Post is not trying to force out higher paid employees.
   The last negotiated contract between the Guild and the Post
established a top minimum pay rate of $664.35 a week. Sandra
Polaski, administrator for the guild, said that under
company-imposed rules pay has been raised, leaving an average
$240-a-week gap between white males, who are at the high end of the
scale, and black females, at the low end.
   She said that even when black women and white men with the same
experience and time at the newspaper are compared, an average
$170-a-week pay discrepancy exists.
   The guild is filing a class action complaint this week with the
D.C. Office of Human Rights asking for an investigation of
differences in pay, hiring, promotion and discharge based on sex,
race, national origin and age, Polaski said.

   A white construction worker was arrested on
assault and other charges after he allegedly attacked a black
corrections officer taking pictures with his girlfriend on a beach,
authorities said.
   The corrections officer, 27-year-old Neville Bonitto, was
clubbed with a steel pipe by the man as a group of whites jeered,
``You don't belong here,'' police said.
   Bonitto suffered cuts and bruises to his right knee, right
shoulder and elbow, said Detective William Stray of the U.S. Park
Police on Monday.
   Paul Guglielmo, 21, was charged with felony assault, aggravated
harassment and criminal possession of a deadly weapon. Officials
said more arrests were expected.
   The incident took place Sunday evening at a beach in the Gateway
National Recreation Area where Bonitto, his girlfriend _ model
Jewel Gittens, 25 _ and another couple, all of them black, were
taking pictures in a gazebo. The pictures were to be used for Ms.
Gittens' professional portfolio.
   The group had a permit to be on the beach, which is only open to
permit holders, said Stray.
   While the group took pictures, Guglielmo and a 17-year-old
companion began screaming racial slurs and threatened to release a
Doberman pinscher to attack them, Stray said.
   ``They were yelling `You don't belong here, you don't belong in
the park here,' but they (the blacks) ignored them,'' said Capt.
Michael Collins of the city police Bias Unit.
   The two white men entered the gazebo, brushed against the blacks
and urinated on a wall about 10 feet away, Stray said. Bonitto
identified himself as a corrections officer and asked them to leave.
   The two men refused and spilled beer on Ms. Gittens. Guglielmo
began scuffling with Bonitto and allegedly clubbed him with the
steel pipe, Stray said.
   During the scuffle, eight other white men and women came over to
aid the two whites. Bonitto pulled out his shield and service
revolver and again identified himself as a law enforcement officer,
but the whites continued to jeer.
   The corrections officer ran to a nearby firehouse, where he
called police. The crowd was still yelling racial slurs when
Bonitto returned with officers and identified Guglielmo as his
attacker, police said.

   The slide also injured 10 workers when it swept through the
electric generating plant in the Liangshan Yi region of Sichuan
province Sunday evening, the agency said. The report said one
person was missing.
   Last week, 11 people died in flooding in Sichuan province after
more than 20 inches of rain fell in two days. In late June, 65
people were reported dead after a heavy rainfall.
   Also last week, a landslide caused by rain in northwest Gansu

<TEXT>
   President Reagan's selection of Richard L.
Thornburgh as his next attorney general marks a return for the
tough-minded former Pennsylvania governor to the law enforcement
roots that first propelled him into the public eye in 1969.
   Reagan said today that he had chosen Thornburgh to replace Edwin
Meese III, who announced last week that he would resign by early
August.
   Former members of Thornburgh's gubernatorial administration were
quick to point out his reputation for integrity and that he
eliminated the corruption that tainted the tenure of his
predecessor, Democrat Milton Shapp.
   They also noted the close ties Thornburgh has kept with the
Reagan administration.
   As governor, Thornburgh, 55, frequently testified on Capitol
Hill on behalf of the president's proposal for line-item veto power
and a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. He has turned
down offers to head the FBI and Agency for International
Development, and was considered for the Health and Human Services
Cabinet post in 1985.
   As governor, Thornburgh said his budget proposals held spending
increases to less than the rate of inflation for eight straight
years. He championed a controversial welfare reform law that
limited cash benefits to three months a year for an estimated
68,000 people considered ``able-bodied.''
   But it was his abilities as a prosecutor that first won him
headlines. He was appointed U.S. attorney for western Pennsylvania
in 1969. His attacks on organized crime, drug trafficking and
pornography led to his being appointed assistant attorney general
in charge of the Justice Department's criminal division by
President Ford in 1975.
   ``In fact, for the first few hours of Jimmy Carter's
administration, he was the highest-ranking person at the Justice
Department,'' said Gwen King, who left a post as head of
Thornburgh's Washington office to become a deputy assistant at the
White House.
   ``He's certainly someone whose integrity is beyond question,''
she said before his appointment was confirmed. ``He could bring
stability and integrity to the position without any doubt, and
frankly, I think the administration would be well-served to ask
him.''
   Democratic critics said Thornburgh lacked compassion, and were
fond of reciting a story of a poor women who began badgering the
governor during a campaign swing in Erie County in 1982. ``Things
are tough all over,'' Thornburgh told the woman.
   But his supporters describe Thornburgh as methodical and cool
under pressure.
   ``All of us who worked for him always viewed him as a person who
weighed things so carefully and was so methodical and precise that
he would be perfect as attorney general,'' said Shirley Dennis, the
Pennsylvania secretary of community affairs under Thornburgh who
now heads the Women's Bureau at the U.S. Department of Labor.
   Barred by law from seeking a third term as governor, Thornburgh
left Pennsylvania at the end of 1986 to head the Institute of
Politics at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. But
he hardly retreated from the public eye.
   Rather, Thornburgh was busier than ever on the political circuit
back home, leading observers to believe his stint at Harvard may
have only been a break between campaigns of one sort or another.
   Thornburgh has been said to be considering running for governor
again when Democrat Robert Casey comes up for re-election in 1990.
He also had been mentioned as a possible running mate for George
Bush.
   ``He's a politician,'' his longtime aide David Runkel said in a
telephone interview. ``He has not closed the door on another
campaign for something.''
   Thornburgh's recent activity has included two fund-raisers that
have netted about $100,000 for the ``Governor Thornburgh
Committee,'' an account he uses to support his travels on behalf of
other candidates, Runkel said.
   In addition, Thornburgh is co-chairman of Pennsylvania's
``Victory '88,'' a federal fund that distributes money for phone
banks and other Republican campaign efforts.
   The possibility of a Bush-Thornburgh ticket excited
Pennsylvania's Republican convention delegates, many of whom named
the former governor as their top choice for the second spot on the
ticket.
   In 1960, an automobile accident killed Thornburgh's wife and
left his youngest son brain-damaged. He was married again in 1963
to schoolteacher Ginny Judson.

   The left wing of a Northwest 727 passenger
jet was damaged when the plane sideswiped a service truck and
caused it to tip over, Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport
police said.
   The 84 passengers were reassigned to later flights because the
plane was forced to return to its hangar, Northwest spokesman Red
Tyler said Monday.
   The truck, which carries fuel filters for airplanes, was
unoccupied at the time of the accident, about 5:40 p.m. Monday. No
one was hurt, airport police said
   The plane, Northwest Flight 398, was bound for Indianapolis.
About 3 feet of its left wing was damaged.
   The truck, property of Butler Aviation, was parked in an airport
service area about 1,000 feet from the runway, when the plane
struck as it prepared for takeoff, said Lt. Gordon Longton of the
airport police.

<TEXT>
   As the 1988 Democratic vice presidential
candidate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas will share an attribute with
many candidates for the the second spot: At the moment of his
selection, he is largely unknown to the American public.
   Few recent polls have sought to gauge the impact of Bentsen on
the ticket, in part because pollsters gauged his chance of
selection as low and in part because so many potential voters have
no opinion of him.
   In a national Gallup poll in mid-May, 77 percent of respondents
said they had not heard enough about Bentsen to say what they
thought of him. The margin of error for the remainder was very
high, about 8 percentage points.
   Of those few with an opinion, 3 percent said they had a very
favorable view of Bentsen, 12 percent mostly favorable, 6 percent
mostly unfavorable and 2 percent very unfavorable.
   Gallup computed a ``ticket strengthening index'' in that poll to
gauge the help a vice presidential candidate could bring his
ticket. New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley and Sen. John Glenn of Ohio
rated highest; Bentsen was near the bottom. However, that measure
was limited by the number of people with an opinion of each
potential candidate, and in Bentsen's case that was low.
   ``There are many other vice presidential possibilties that are
more popular than Bentsen. Basically the guy just does not have
much name recognition on a national scale,'' said Larry Hugick, a
Gallup pollster.
   Hugick noted that Gallup just completed a poll during the
weekend that tested two possibile Dukakis running mates _ Glenn and
Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee. ``We picked the wrong Southerner,''
he said.
   In an NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll last month, 60 percent
said the vice president candidate was very important to their
choice of a ticket. But Bentsen was not among the five possible
Democratic running-mates tested.
   A CBS News-New York Times poll in May tested Glenn, Sen. Sam
Nunn of Georgia and Jesse Jackson as possible running mates, but
again, not Bentsen. Jeff Alderman, pollster for ABC News, said he
also has not tested Bentsen as a candidate for vice president.
   ``It would remain to be seen based on his performance and how
Dukakis utilizes his new choice here how much he helps,'' Alderman
said. ``He's well known in Texas. Presumably it helps there. In the
rest of the country it remains to be seen how well he'll play,
because he is not known by a vast majority of the country at all.''
   Alderman noted, however, that many other candidates for vice
president, and even for president, start as relative unknowns. In a
CBS-Times poll in November, for example, 77 percent of respondents
had no opinion of Dukakis.

<HEAD>Ex-Navy Photographer Says Crash Photos Sealed To Avoid Publicity</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former Navy photographer said he was
transferred from the Blue Angels after he entered photographs of a
fatal collision between two jets from the flight demonstration
squadron in a photo contest.
   Wayne Singleton said the photographs were pulled from the
contest because they were embarrassing to the Navy.
   Blue Angels' spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Doug Hocking, however, said
Singleton was made available for transfer and the photographs were
removed because of their graphic content and his failure to obtain
authorization before entering them.
   The pictures shoed a 1985 collision during an air show over
Niagara Falls, N.Y. One pilot was killed and the other pilot
parachuted to safety after the collision, and an investigation
blamed pilot error.
   Singleton entered the photographs in the 1986 Military
Photographer of the Year contest.
   Two photos of the crash by Singleton were published Monday in
the Pensacola New Journal, which said it received the photos
anonymously. The Blue Angels are based at the Pensacola Naval Air
Station.
   Singleton, now a civilian free-lance photographer reportedly
living in Arizona, said he was scheduled for transfer to security
guard school on the remote island of Diego Garcia in the Indian
Ocean but managed to get sent instead to Lakehurst, N.J., and
continue in photography until his release.
   Blue Angels commanding officer Cmdr. Gil Rud accused Singleton
of failing to turn the photos over for use by investigators
immediately after the accident and lying when he claimed the film
had been lost until after the probe was concluded.
   Singleton said he found the film four months after the crash.
   Before Singleton left, the Blue Angels ordered him to turn over
all copies and negatives of the crash photos, but his boss in New
Jersey found a set of the crash pictures in Singleton's portfolio.
   Singleton said he was reduced in rank as a result.

   The Senate, looking to protect the interests
of 30 million veterans and their dependents, today overwhelmingly
approved legislation creating a Cabinet-level Department of
Veterans Affairs.
   The bill was approved 84-11. Negotiators will work out technical
differences between the bill and a version the House passed last
November, just a week after it was recommended by President Reagan.
   The secretary of veterans' affairs would be the 14th Cabinet
secretary and the fifth added since 1960.
   Voting against elevating the Veterans Administration to Cabinet
level were Sens. William Armstrong, R-Colo.; Dan Evans, R-Wash.;
Jake Garn, R-Utah; Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H.; Nancy Kassebaum,
R-Kan.; James McClure, R-Idaho; William Proxmire, D-Wis.; Dan
Quayle, R-Ind.; Warren Rudman, R-N.H.; Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., and
Steven Symms, R-Idaho.
   Not voting were Sens. Joe Biden, D-Del.; Orrin Hatch, R-Utah;
Jesse Helms, R-N.C.; Paul Trible, R-Va., and John Warner, R-Va.
   ``For the first time, the Veterans Administration will have
direct access to the president without an intervening party,'' Sen.
Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii, said Monday as the Senate debated the
measure. ``For the first time, the secretary of veterans' affairs
will sit in the highest policy councils of the land.''
   Earlier in the day, the Senate agreed to allow veterans to
appeal to the courts when their claims for benefits are denied by
VA. That measure also would repeal a provision, enacted at the end
of the Civil War, that prohibits lawyers from charging more than
$10 to press a claim for a veteran.
   This bill, approved on an 86-11 vote, has failed four times in
the House in recent years, apparently because of fears that lawyers
would replace the voluntary organizations, including American
Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars, in dealing with VA.
   Nevertheless, Senate Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Alan
Cranston, D-Calif., said, ``I think this time we have enough
momentum to get this measure approved by the full Congress.''
   The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee concluded that
elevation of VA to the Cabinet ``would best serve America's
veterans, the American public and, ultimately, the president of the
United States through strengthening of the Cabinet as a
policymaking mechanism.''
   Simpson, a former chairman of the committee, said he sees no
rational reason for the bill. ``If anybody believes veterans need a
stronger voice ... than they already have, then I've missed
something in the nine years I've been here.''
   The changes would take effect Jan. 1. Republicans sought to
allow Reagan to name the first secretary immediately, even though
there would be no department to preside over this year. That
proposal was defeated.
   VA, created in 1930, has the third largest work force in the
federal government, exceeded only by the Defense Department and the
Postal Service. It has a $28 billion annual budget and 240,000
employees, administers almost 90,000 patient beds in 534 health
facilities and last year had 20 million outpatient visits.
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates raising the VA status
will cost $33 million over five years.
   In giving veterans limited access to the courts to appeal claims
cases, the Senate rejected by a 61-36 margin a far more restrictive
amendment by Sen. Frank Murkowski of Alaska, senior Republican on
the Veterans' Affairs Committee. It would have allowed review only
of VA regulations, not of the agency's factual findings about an
individual veteran's claim.
   The Senate-passed bill would permit a court to overturn an
adverse finding of fact by the VA's Board of Veterans' Appeals when
the court finds the decision ``so utterly lacking in a rational
basis in the evidence that a manifest and grievous injustice would
result if such finding were not set aside.''
   Murkowski argued against the change, saying the current system
works adequately.
   ``Does anyone, anywhere have evidence that the system is so
broken that without federal court intervention in thousands of
individual claims our veterans are going to be deprived of a fair
shake?'' he asked. He cited statistics that the Board of Veterans'
Appeals reverses up to 25 percent of claim denials and said the
bill would add about 4,500 cases a year to the nation's backlogged
courts.

<HEAD>Peddler Patrol Begins; Vendors Stay Off New York Streets In
Protest</HEAD>

to Fulton Street Mall</NOTE>

   Many hungry New Yorkers scanned the streets in
vain for hot dogs, shish kebabs and ice cream as Mayor Edward I.
Koch began enforcing a 5-year-old ban on food vendors on crowded
city sidewalks.
   A special police unit took to the streets Monday to see that
licensed vendors follow the ordinance, which limits the time and
location that food pushcarts may operate. But many peddlers had
already pulled their stands off the sidewalks in protest, and said
they planned to demonstrate at City Hall.
   ``Demonstrations will have no impact on us. None at all!'' said
the mayor. ``I wouldn't care if they came with 20,000 stands (to
City Hall). It will have no impact.''
   Police said they confiscated four of the polished metal
pushcarts with colorful umbrellas during the first day of the
peddler patrol. But some 600 carts disappeared from the streets as
a small group of vendors gathered across from Radio City Music Hall
to protest.
   ``It means I've got two kids and I'm out of work now. And the
mayor doesn't give a damn,'' said Thomas Michaelides, who's been
hawking hot dogs for 25 years, like his father before him.
   Those looking for a cheap lunch found themselves going hungry or
paying more than they'd like.
   ``I can't afford a $4 sandwich,'' said Jane Faraci, 36, an
office worker. ``But I can afford a $1 hot dog.'' She sat without a
meal near Rockefeller Center, sipping the soda she had purchased to
drink with her lunch.
   The mayor admitted the crackdown was a bit of political
arm-twisting to get the City Council to pass a new law that would
allow six vendors, chosen by lottery, to work each prime street
block.
   But the vendors and City Council members have balked at the
plan, resulting in Koch's edict to begin enforcing the 1983 law,
which bans vendors from corners in midtown, including Rockefeller
Center and Times Square, in the Wall Street area, near the United
Nations and in Brooklyn's Fulton Street Mall.
   A spokeswoman for the City Council, Peg Breen, said the sweep
was ``overreacting.'' She said current law, prudently enforced,
could reduce sidewalk overcrowding.
   The M. Parpis Food Distribution Co., which owns 50 vending
carts, found little help in court to fight the ban.
   Parpis' lawyers argued in Manhattan's state Supreme Court that
the ban is an unreasonable use of the city's regulatory power.
   But Justice Irving Kirschenbaum said Monday the city was within
its legal rights. Five hours later, Justice Ernst H. Rosenberger of
the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court denied a similar
request by Parpis.
   Interspersed among the picketing vendors were a dozen
red-bereted Guardian Angels, whose leader, Curtis Sliwa, vowed the
group would try to physically block the city from confiscating any
carts.
   ``As you are carting away their carts and taking the vendors
away in handcuffs, crack dealers are operating with impunity on the
same block,'' said Sliwa.
   Vendors whose carts are confiscated face up to a $1,000 fine.
Recovering the carts will cost $65 plus a $5-a-day storage fee.

today, the 133rd and 134th in a series of tests of the weapons
system, officials said.
   The first missile was fired at 4:40 a.m. from an EC-135 jet, the

of the base information office.
   The missile reached its target in the Kwajalien Atoll test

   The second missile was launched at 6:21 a.m. from the ground at
the base, 150 miles northwest of Los Angeles.
   The second missile followed the same path as the first and
reached the target range about 30 minutes after launch, said Airman
1st Class Ann-Marie Townsend.
   Both missiles were launched by a task force from F.E. Warren Air
Force Base in Wyoming.

<HEAD>Dukakis Hopes Selection of Texan Makes History Repeat</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis undoubtedly hopes the selection
of Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen to be his vice presidential running
mate will rekindle warm memories of 1960 and become an example of
history repeating itself.
   But Dukakis didn't make this choice on nostalgia alone.
Geography, Washington experience and a relatively conservative
voting record pointed the way to Bentsen _ a fellow who has already
defeated George Bush once.
   Beyond helping in Texas, Bentsen's choice is designed to
reassure the white male voters across the South who have abandoned
the Democratic Party in droves in recent elections, and to win over
the voters who shunned Dukakis in many of the primaries across the
South on Super Tuesday last March.
   The history Dukakis hopes to repeat is John F. Kennedy's choice
of Texas Sen. Lyndon Johnson, a decision that enabled the
Democratic ticket to carry Texas and claim the White House in one
of the closest elections of modern times.
   In many ways, Kennedy is a political model and a hero for
Dukakis, who delights in recalling how he and close friend Paul
Brountas once traveled across country in a battered car to see the
son of Massachusetts nominated for president in Los Angeles 28
years ago.
   Now, more than a quarter century later, another son of
Massachusetts is the Democratic Party's leader, and longtime
sidekick Brountas shepherded the selection of a partner for the
fall campaign.
   Kennedy's brother, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, quickly embraced the
selection of Bentsen, saying today, ``The Massachusetts-Texas
combination got this country moving again in 1960, and it will do
the same for the nation in 1988.''
   Bush's top campaign aides speak hopefully of a virtual lock on
Southern electoral votes, putting 200 to 220 such votes within the
vice president's grasp with relative ease.
   Texas accounts for 29 of those votes, and no Democrat in this
century has won the White House without carrying the state. ``This
will make Texas a real battleground,'' said one Dukakis campaign
strategist, and indeed it should.
   Bentsen defeated Bush in the state in a 1970 Senate race, and
will be on the ballot twice this year. Under a special law passed
for Johnson in 1960, Bentsen can seek re-election to his seat as
well as run for vice president.
   So while Bush may yet win the South, Bentsen's selection means
it won't be easy. And the more time Bush is forced to spend in the
South defending his natural political base, the less time he has to
challenge Dukakis in California, Illinois, Michigan and Ohio,
states shaping up as the critical tests in the battle for the White
House.
   Bush, of course, has the luxury of going second in the vice
presidential selection game. He may now choose to maximize his
chances in California, or pick a candidate from one of the
industrial state battlegrounds, thus checking Dukakis' move. He
could also stake out new territory, by choosing a woman for example.
   Dukakis also balanced the ticket in another way when he selected
Bentsen.
   He has been urged repeatedly to select someone who has
experience in Washington, and Bentsen is the walking embodiment of
the Senate establishment. He is chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, a one-time head of the Democratic Senatorial Committee
and widely respected by his peers.
   But Bentsen is no clone of Dukakis, just as Johnson was no clone
of Kennedy. He has voted in favor of funding for the Contra rebels
battling the government of Nicaragua, and his record on civil
rights will come under scrutiny from the liberals whose support
also will be needed for Dukakis to win the White House.
   An early test will come on Wednesday, when Bentsen is expected
to join Dukakis in an appearance before the NAACP in Washington.

<DATELINE>TYRE, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Irish troops of the United Nations
peacekeeping force in south Lebanon were caught in the crossfire
today in a battle between Israeli-backed militiamen and Shiite
Moslem guerrillas, security sources said.
   The sources said they had no immediate word of militia or
civilian casualties because the fighting was too intense around the
village of Braachit to allow U.N. or Red Cross teams to enter.
   Timur Goksel, spokesman for the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon,
said units of the Irish battalion manning several positions in
Braachit, 15 miles southeast of Tyre, were pinned down in the
fighting. But no casualties were reported among U.N. troops.
   Goksel said the fighting broke out at 1 p.m. when ``unknown
elements'' fired two rocket-propelled grenades at a hilltop
position manned by the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army near
Braachit.
   The Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army, which man's Israel's
self-designated security zone along the border, has come under
repeated attack by Moslem guerrillas.
   Goksel said South Lebanon Army tanks fired 90 rounds into the
village, which lies on the northern edge of the Israeli security
zone.
   The sources said five artillery or tank shells a minute were
hitting the village, which has a population of 3,000.
   The sources said two Israeli Cobra helicopter gunships later
attacked the village with machine gun fire.
   An Irish officer in Braachit, reached by telephone, said ``most
of the village has been destroyed.''
   The security sources said Lebanese Red Cross teams made two
attempts to enter the village to bring out casualties, but were
driven back by gunfire.
   Israel established the security zone in south Lebanon after it
withdrew the bulk of its forces from Lebanon in 1985. The Israelis
had invaded Lebanon three years earlier.

<HEAD>FBI Reportedly Keeps Chinese Interpol Leader Out Of U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI prevented a top officer of an
international police organization from entering the United States
because he was believed to be a spy who helped China gain access to
U.S. intelligence information, the Los Angeles Times reported today.
   Zhu Entao, a vice president of Interpol, was to have attended
the group's executive committee meeting in Washington last week,
but was refused a visa to enter the country, the newspaper said..
   Authorities believe Zhu played a key role in gathering
information from Larry Wu-Tai Chin, a former CIA translator. Chin
committed suicide two years ago after being convicted of selling
classified information to the Beijing government.
   Over a long period, Chin allegedly turned over volumes of
top-secret documents revealing the West's assessment of China's
strategic, military, economic and scientific capabilites.
   The Chin case was considered one of the most severe breaches in
American intelligence security in recent years.
   Chiwei Zhang, press officer for the People's Republic of China,
denounced the barring of Zhu as ``a violation of international
norms.''
   However, he declined to say what intelligence role Zhu plays for
China.
   China retaliated by notifying the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration that it was canceling plans for two Chinese
narcotics agents to attend a DEA international training session at
Quantico, Va., in the fall.
   Government sources told the newspaper that U.S. officials tried
to downplay their refusal to give Zhu a visa by arranging for the
Interpol meeting to take place at the group's Paris headquarters
instead of in Washington. Zhu reportedly attended the Paris
gathering.
   Richard C. Stiener, chief of Interpol's U.S. national central
bureau, was ``too tied up and won't be able to talk'' about the Zhu
incident, spokeswoman Beverly R. Sweatman said.
   However, she said Zhu was elected a delegate at Interpol's 1985
general assembly meeting in the United States, which means that he
attended that session.
   A U.S. intelligence source told The Times the FBI raised
objections to Zhu's most recent attempt to enter the country
because they knew more about him after the Chin case than they did
in 1985.

<TEXT>
   Four inmates, including two convicted
murderers, fooled prison guards by putting ``dummies'' in their
cots and escaped overnight from a state prison in central
Arakansas, officials said today.
   The escape was discovered at 7 a.m., but prison spokesman David
White said authorities were not sure when the men broke out of the
prison's maximum security unit in Tucker, about 30 miles southeast
of Little Rock.
   White said bed checks are usually conducted about every four
hours, and the dummies were counted at least twice during the night.
   ``At the 7 a.m. count, when there wasn't any movement, they were
discovered missing,'' White said.
   At about the same time, authorities also found a hole in a fence
around the prison. According to White, it was the first escape from
the unit.
   White identified the escapees as convicted murderers James Ray
Renton, 50, and Raymond Coble, 29; Tommy Winberry, 38, convicted of
two counts of attempted murder, and David Fane, 31, convicted of
aggravated robbery and other crimes.
   Coble and Winberry escaped from another state prison in November
1986, White said, but were recaptured a short time later.
   Jefferson County Sheriff's Lt. Boe Fontaine said deputies were
using an airplane, tracking dogs and a roadblock in their search
for the escapees.

<TEXT>
   Democrat Lloyd Bentsen, the tall, urbane Texan
apparently chosen as Michael Dukakis' running mate, is one of the
Senate's respected voices on foreign affairs and economic issues.
   His selection comes 18 years after he began his Senate career
with a victory over George Bush, the expected Republican
presidential nominee this year.
   Bentsen, 67, a low-key politician, had a brief run at his
party's presidential nomination in 1976 and was mentioned as a
possible vice-presidential running mate for Jimmy Carter that year
and Walter Mondale in 1984. He moved into the congressional
forefront over the past three years in the Democratic drive to
sharpen the nation's position in global trade.
   He is a Southwestern conservative, a Protestant, a silver-haired
Washington insider.
   Bentsen is the scion of a wealthy landed family from the Rio
Grande Valley. Like most Texas legislators, he has remained loyal
to the interests of the oil industry, although believing in a
significant role for government in guiding the U.S. economy.
   On the negative side, Bentsen created a furor in February 1987
when it was revealed that he had asked lobbyists to pay $10,000
apiece to join him for breakfast once a month.
   The breakfast club, called the ``Chairman's Council,'' held one
meeting and was quickly disbanded. Bentsen returned the money
collected from an estimated 40 lobbyists.
   Bentsen served in the House of Representatives for six years
during the late 1940s and 1950s, then left Washington to make money
as a businessman in Houston.
   After a successful business career, he decided to run for the
Senate in 1970 and was asked why.
   ``I think people are little bit like ivy. They ought to be
repotted once in a while,'' he said.
   He received a law degree from the University of Texas in 1942
and joined the Army Air Corps, earning his pilot's wings and flying
bomber missions over the Third Reich. He served as a Hidalgo
County, Texas, judge from 1946 through 1948, when he was elected to
Congress.
   In the House, he once suggested that then-President Dwight
Eisenhower threaten North Korea with nuclear bombs unless they
withdraw their forces north of the 38th parallel.
   Bentsen left the House without seeking reelection in 1954, and
became president of Lincoln Consolidated, a financial holding
company.
   In 1970, he decided against long odds to challenge incumbent
Sen. Ralph Yarborough, who represented the liberal wing of the
Democratic Party. Bentsen accused Yarborough of supporting the
violence which occurred during anti-Vietnam War demonstrations at
the 1968 Democratic presidential convention.
   In the general election against Bush, Bentsen lost most of the
minority voters in Texas, but won big in rural areas and among
blue-collar Democrats.
   During his years in the Senate, Bentsen gradually moderated his
conservative views, often voting for a broader federal role on
social issues, and gradually opposing the Vietnam War.
   ``We have fulfilled our commitment,'' Bentsen said in 1971,
three years before last U.S. combat troops left.
   After the fighting stopped, he was a prime sponsor of the War
Powers Act which seeks to give Congress a bigger role in deciding
whether the United States should be involved in armed conflicts
overseas.
   More recently, Bentsen moved into a number of posts which made
him better known nationaly. They included a Senate campaign
committee job in which he dispensed tens of thousands of dollars to
the Senate campaigns of Democrats.

   The legislature of Nagorno-Karabakh, a largely
Armenian mountain enclave at the heart of a months-long ethnic
dispute, voted today to secede from the republic of Azerbaijan and
join Armenia, reporters in the area said.
   Reporters for the radio station in Nagorno-Karabakh's main city,
Stepanakert, read a statement by telephone saying the region's
lawmakers had taken the bold step at a meeting today.
   ``The Soviet of People's Deputies of the Nagorno-Karabakh
Autonomous Region declares its secession from the Azerbaijan Soviet
Socialist Republic,'' the statement said.
   It said the legislature had voted with only one abstention to
secede and rename the region the Artsakh Autonomous Oblast of the
neighboring republic of Armenia.
   The legal standing of the decision, which defies central
authorities all the way up to Soviet Communist Party general
secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev, is unclear.
   The Soviet Constitution says any proposed territorial change
must be approved by the republic affected. Azerbaijan's parliament
rejected Nagorno-Karabakh's earlier request to join Armenia on June
17.
   Armenians, who are mainly Christian, consider Nagorno-Karabakh
to be part of their ancient homeland, but it was incorporated into
mostly Moslem Azerbaijan in 1923. The dispute erupted in strikes
and street demonstrations by Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh and
Armenia itself in February.
   Gorbachev said at the Communist Party conference June 28 that it
was time to widen the powers of the country's 15 union republics,
the autonomous republics and other ethnic entities.
   But he said some ethnic minorities were going too far.
   ``Some think that any questions _ from the redrawing of borders
to the establishment of opposition parties _ can be resolved''
through glasnost, or greater openness, Gorbachev said.
   ``The Central Committee believes such abuses of democratization
run counter to the task of perestroika, contradict the people's
interests,'' Gorbachev said. Perestroika is Gorbachev's
wide-ranging program to restructure Soviet society.
   Nagorno-Karabakh's legislature had voted Feb. 20 to request the
transfer, but today's decision amounted to a unilateral declaration
of secession.
   The Nagorno-Karabakh legislature had proposed a compromise on
June 21, saying the area could be turned over temporarily to the
central government in Moscow while a longer-term solution was
sought.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda said today that most
Armenians have decided to return to work and quit a weeklong
general strike in their capital, Yerevan.
   The walkout began July 4 and virtually paralyzed Yerevan and
other parts of the Armenian republic. Armenians are demanding the
annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Pravda quoted local party leaders as saying 195 out of the 231
industrial enterprises in Yerevan were operating at full volume
Monday. It said 31 others were partially operating and five
remained shut.
   Of the city's 1,249 streetcars, trolleybuses and buses, only 170
did not operate, Pravda said.
   However, dissident journalist Mofses Gorgisyan, a resident of
the republic, said the walkout was gaining strength and that on
Monday, factory representatives reported 70 percent absenteeism. He
said troops and tanks were deployed on the outskirts of Yerevan,
and militia were patrolling within city.
   Gorgisyan said 300,000-400,000 people gathered outside Armenia's
Institute of Ancient Manuscripts on Monday to drum up support for
the strike. A reporter for the republic's state-run news agency,
Armenpress, who declined to give his name, put the number of
demonstrators at about 100,000.
   Gorgisyan, 27, is a member of an underground group called the
Alliance for National Self-Determination and publisher of an
underground journal called Fatherland.
   Many Armenians decided to return to their jobs because of
appeals by prominent cultural figures at a demonstration Sunday,
who asked them to use other means of protest, said a Yerevan
resident contacted Monday by telephone.
   ``They suggested meetings, open statements, but not strikes,''
said the resident, who identified himself as a television reporter
but declined to give his name.
   The government daily Izvestia said hundreds of thousands of
people attended Sunday's rally, and that some speakers harshly
criticized Armenian delegates to the June 28-July 1 Communist Party
conference in Moscow for ``not defending national interests.''
   Resolutions adopted at the conference did not mention the
Nagorno-Karabakh dispute.
   Ethnic rioting sparked by the territorial dispute broke out in
the Azerbaijan port of Sumgait in February, and officials said 32
people were killed, including 26 Armenians and six Azerbaijanis.

<TEXT>
   South African, Angolan, Cuban and U.S.
officials met today for the last day of their talks on ending South
African rule in neighboring Namibia and withdrawing Cuban troops
from Angola.
   The military and political officials held the talks at the U.S.
Coast Guard base on Governors Island in New York harbor.
   The participants in the talks have released no comments on the
outcome of the talks.
   South Africa has said it would accept a U.N. Security Council
resolution calling for Namibia's independence under black majority
rule only after the withdrawal of an estimated 50,000 Cuban troops
backing Angola's Marxist government.
   Anti-communist rebels, backed by the United States and South
Africa, have been fighting government troops since 1985.
   U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have said
the timetable for the Cuban pullout has not been set and is the
most difficult issue in the talks.
   The U.S. goal is a complete Cuban withdrawal within one year,
when a United Nations resolution has proposed granting independence
to Namibia, also called South-West Africa.
   Angola and Cuba have said that the Cuban withdrawal should take
place over four years.
   Angola has been convulsed by civil war since it gained
independence from Portugal in 1975. The government, supported by
Cuba, has been fighting anti-communist rebels belonging to the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
   South Africa has repeatedly sent troops across the border from
Namibia into Angola to support the rebel forces. The Angolan
government is seeking the permanent withdrawal of all South African
forces from its territory.
   Cuba has increased its troop strength in Angola from 35,000 to
37,000 soldiers last fall to about 50,000 now, U.S. officials have
said.
   South Africa has had administrative control over Namibia since
1920.
   The four parties involved in the current talks first met for
talks in London in May and again last month in Cairo, Egypt.

   With Michael Dukakis' selection of Lloyd Bentsen
as his running mate, the 1988 Democratic presidential ticket will
consist of two millionaires.
   Bentsen has a personal worth estimated at $1.4 million to $2
million, according to financial disclosure forms on file in public
records.
   The Texas senator is also a prolific campaign fund raiser who
ran into controversy last year with a practice of collecting
$10,000 apiece from lobbyists who ate breakfast with him once a
month.
   After press reports surfaced about the ``breakfast club,''
Bentsen acknowledged in February 1987 that he had made a ``doozy''
of a mistake in forming such a club.
   Bentsen had solicited members to his ``Chairman's Council'' by
sending letters to 200 political action committees and lobbyists
telling them he was seeking advice and assistance for his campaign.
   On his personal financial statement this year, which is separate
from the campaign fund, Bentsen listed income of between $296,733
and $418,225 and up. The forms are designed in a manner that does
not require disclosure of a specific amount.
   His assets included a Warwick condominium and furnishings in
Houston, a qualified blind trust from which he received at least
$100,001 in interest last year, a note to Brazoria Lake inc. of
Brazoria County, Texas, and Bellfield Farm on the Shenandoah River
in Clarke County, Va.
   Bentsen was born into wealth. His father, ``Big Lloyd'' Bentsen,
migrated to the Rio Grande Valley after World War I and made
himself wealthy as a rancher and by buying land and reselling it.
   Dukakis has a net worth of more than $500,000 in property,
investments and salary, and also is the potential beneficiary of $1
million in trusts.

   Michael Dukakis, apparently having chosen Lloyd
Bentsen as his vice presidential running mate, smiled and joked
with news photographers today but declined to talk about the choice
that sources said he'd made.
   The sources, who commented only on condition they not be named,
said the Texas senator was chosen late Monday night in a meeting
among Dukakis, his long-time confidant Paul Brountas and campaign
manager Susan Estrich. The word was passed to Bentsen late in the
night or early this morning and he accepted.
   Bentsen, 67, was flying to Boston today to meet with Dukakis.
   Dukakis refused to speak to reporters when he arrived at the
Statehouse today, although he allowed photographers into his office
as he sifted through paperwork. ``It's kind of fun, this business
running for the presidency,'' he said.
   Dukakis and Brountas met Monday night a few hours after Brountas
talked with Jesse Jackson in Washington.
   As Brountas left the house, he was asked if the selection
process was over and he replied, ``He (Dukakis) can always ask more
questions if he wants.''
   Asked if a decision had been made, the Boston lawyer said, ``No
comment.''
   While he waited for Brountas, Dukakis appeared in his yard
shortly after dark, dressed in shorts and a short-sleeve shirt and
mowed his lawn with a push mower.
   Dukakis was meeting today with party chairman from around the
country, a session designed to assure them that they would be
included in planning for the fall campaign.
   ``We asked for the meeting,'' said Ohio Democratic chairman
James Ruvolo. ``We wanted to get things squared away.''
   Ruvolo said he had no idea what the status was of his state's
vice-presidential favorite, Sen. John Glenn of Ohio.
   Speculation about the potential vice presidential choice was a
top subject of conversation in Atlanta among the early arrivals for
the convention.
   The top contenders were believed to include Glenn and Sen.
Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee. Also on the short list were Sens.
Bentsen and Bob Graham of Florida and Reps. Richard Gephardt of
Missouri and Lee Hamilton of Indiana.
   The contenders themselves were maintaining a discreet silence _
except for Jackson who said for the first time that ``if it was
offered to me I would accept it.''
   Jackson made his statement after meeting with Brountas in
Washington, his first public declaration that he would accept the
spot if Dukakis offered it.
   Jackson said he gave Brountas the detailed personal financial
information that has been solicited from prospective running mates,
and said he offered his ``candid view as to the office of vice
president ... and what I thought my qualifications would be.''
   Brountas refused to discuss the substance of the discussion,
saying only that it was ``an excellent meeting ... very
productive.''
   Jackson said ``it is self-evident'' that he wants to be vice
president and said he assured Brountas that he would be a loyal
second to Dukakis.
   If he is not on the ticket, said Jackson, he would expect
further discussions with Dukakis about his role in the fall
campaign.

   Police with dogs today captured a
murderer whose girlfriend allegedly hijacked the helicopter used in
an aerial prison breakout that was foiled by other copters after a
wild two-hour chase, authorities said.
   Daniel Mahoney, 30, was caught early this morning near Los Lunas
after a corrections officer spotted his trail and called a canine
unit, which tracked him along the Rio Grande, said state police
Sgt. John Balderston.
   The two other Penitentiary of New Mexico inmates who escaped
Monday morning with Mahoney, his girlfriend and the pilot also were
in custody today. The pilot said he had been hijacked and a friend
said he had flown the same helicopter in the movie ``Rambo III.''
   Authorities gave this account of the escape attempt, during
which a U.S. Customs Service helicopter was nearly rammed and the
escapees allegedly tried to force a state police chopper into a
crane:
   A yellow-and-bronze Aerospatiale Gazelle helicopter landed in a
prison yard about 9:50 a.m. Monday, and the three convicts jumped
aboard amid fire from tower guards. One other unidentified convict
was forced off or jumped off the chopper, which haad a hard time
getting off the ground.
   A Customs copter and Immigration and Naturalization Service
airplane chased them 80 miles south to Mid-Valley Airport in Los
Lunas, where Mahoney, Randy Mack Lackey and Beverly Shoemaker
jumped out. Waiting state troopers wounded and arrested Lackey
after he tried to run them down with a pickup truck.
   They also arrested Ms. Shoemaker, 41, but Mahoney escaped.
   The Gazelle flew to Coronado Airport, a commuter airport on the
north side of Albuquerque, where it hovered as police drove up. It
headed south as a state police helicopter joined the chase, and
headed for Albuquerque International Airport. There, the Gazelle
tried to ram the Customs craft and to force the police copter into
a crane.
   ``We were hanging right with him,'' said state police pilot Maj.
John Denko. ``We were not giving him a chance to set down and get
away.''
   The Gazelle landed on the airport tarmac with its pursuers right
behind, Denko said. The pilot ``was running low on fuel. He was
getting desperate.''
   A man later identified as Francis Preston Mitchell leaped out,
``looked around for a second, put his hands up and flattened on the
ground,'' he said.
   The pilot, Charles ``Cheater'' Bella, 43, of El Paso, Texas, was
found in the helicopter, handcuffed to the controls, authorities
said. ``No one was armed when we got to them,'' Denko said, adding
that officers saw two guns thrown out of the helicopter during the
chase.
   Bella was being held at the Santa Fe County Jail today while
police checked his story that he was hijacked after flying to Santa
Fe to pick up a fare.
   Bella, owner of Bear Helicopters, was hired by a man who
identified himself as a businessman, said his wife, Carrol, in El
Paso. He told his wife that Ms. Shoemaker put a gun to his head and
handcuffed him to the control stick.
   Bella's Gazelle played the ``Russian'' copter movie star
Sylvester Stallone shot down with a explosive-tipped arrow in
``Rambo III,'' said a friend, Tony Mobley. Bella also did stunts in
the movie ``Extreme Prejudice.''
   Ms. Shoemaker's name appears on Mahoney's visitor list and the
Santa Fe resident is believed to be his girlfriend, said Dan
Taylor, spokesman for the state Department of Public Safety.
   Mahoney was serving life plus 60 years for second-degree murder
in Florida. Lackey, 36, was treated in Albuquerque for a shoulder
wound and returned to the prison, where he was serving nine years
for larceny in Curry County, N.M. Mitchell, 26, was doing life for
murder in Summit County, Utah.
   The three escapees had been housed in adjacent cells, and were
classified as medium-security prisoners, said state Corrections
Secretary O.L. McCotter.
   Mahoney and Mitchell were being held in New Mexico under an
interstate agreement providing for exchange of prisoners among
states.

   Geraldine Ferraro, who four years ago became
the first woman on a major party's national ticket, said today she
was ``delighted'' with Michael Dukakis' plans to name Texas Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen as his Democratic running mate.
   She said that had there been enough women in political office to
provide Dukakis with a good choice for a female running mate she
would have been disappointed at his choice of a man.
   ``But because we don't have a woman in that spot, I am not
(disappointed),'' she said in a telephone interview from New York.
   Ms. Ferraro, part of the losing Democratic ticket with Walter
Mondale in 1984, said Bentsen ``has been fine on issues that I and
many women care about and in addition to that he's going to be a
very strong help to the ticket, rounding it out beautifully so that
with a Democrat in the White House it's going to make a difference
for the women in this country.''
   ``I'm delighted. I think it's an indication that Governor
Dukakis intends to run a strong national campaign. I think he's
going to go down South and seriously battle the Republicans for
those votes that should be ours based upon the conditions facing
this country,'' she said.
   Earlier, Ms. Ferraro told USA Today that there were not enough
women in positions from which national offices are traditionally
chosen _ the U.S. Senate, Congress and statehouses _ to provide
Dukakis with a good choice. She said no women currently in elected
office meet Dukakis' need of a candidate strong on foreign policy
experience who will also give him geographic balance.
   She said Jesse Jackson ``does not have those credentials that,
politically, Michael Dukakis needs in his vice president.''
   ``Had I not been a woman _ and I'm the first one to say it _ I
probably would not have been chosen,'' she told the newspaper. ``In
1984 ... it was time to remove this final barrier from women's
achieving political power.''
   She said her candidacy in 1984 and Jackson's campaigns are
expanding participation in the political process.
   ``Between Jackson's campaign this year and 1984, we as a nation
said, `Enough already, we're going to let everybody have a chance
to participate.' That's a big thing nobody can take away,'' she
said.
   Ms. Ferraro, 52, said she also has no bitterness over a national
profile that brought harsh scrutiny of her family and criminal
investigations of her husband. Her son was convicted of a drug
charge this year.
   ``1984 was an incredible opportunity for me. That doesn't lead
one to be bitter. I genuinely feel my husband and son were singled
out. That doesn't make us bitter,'' she said. ``I'm not going to
let that happen to me.''

   Crude oil prices dropped sharply for the second
straight day today, tumbling toward the $14-a-barrel level in
reaction to fears of a relentless supply glut and OPEC's failure to
restrain output.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, a sensitive barometer of
price trends, the August-delivery price for West Texas Intermediate
was $14.49 a barrel by midday, down 29 cents from the 20-month
closing low of $14.78 set Monday.
   ``The market is awash in crude and the focus has returned to
that,'' said Chris McCormack, an energy futures trader with the New
York investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ``The market just
looks extremely bearish.''
   The decline Monday erased gains made last week, which were based
on fears of supply disruptions caused by a major oil platform
explosion in the North Sea.
   Refined products traded on the exchange also fell sharply,
although not as steeply as crude. Wholesale heating oil for August
delivery fell 2.06 cents a gallon to 41.33 cents, while wholesale
unleaded gasoline fell 1.04 cents a gallon to 52.13 cents.
   At one point during the day, crude prices rose briefly on a news
report that the price-monitoring committee of the 13-member
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries might confer soon.
   OPEC's official news agency said the meeting might be held after
the cartel's general secretary, Indonesia's Subroto, met with
officials of the United Arab Emirates for talks ``concerning the
current oil market situation.'' Output cheating by members of the
cartel has weakened the market seriously recently, making OPEC's
$18-per-barrel target price more remote than ever. The United Arab
Emirates has been mentioned as a significant violator.
   Said Edward Ryan, a trader at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.'s energy
futures unit, ``Crude has gotten down to a supply-demand scenario.
There's simply too much. I think the market needs to see something
of substance. The rhetoric of OPEC is ridiculous. Every trader
considers it ridiculous.''
   By some analyst reckonings, the cartel now is pumping as much as
18.8 million barrels a day, more than 3 million barrels a day over
its official ceiling of 15.06 million barrels.

   Thunderstorms drenched central Texas today after dropping nearly
10 inches of rain, causing severe flooding along rivers and creeks,
while storms pelted New England with hail and wind gusting to 89
mph.
   Five people were killed in the Texas floods, including four
members of a California family whose station wagon was swept down a
flooded creekbed in western Texas. One man was missing after he
tried to reach safety from a stalled truck in the rain-swollen
Guadalupe River near Hunt.
   During a six-hour period overnight in Texas, 1.97 inches of rain
fell at Crossville, 1.12 inches at Bergstrom Air Force Base in
Austin and .81 inches at San Antonio.
   Rain continued early today over south-central Texas, and
forecasters warned that more heavy rain was possible.
   Showers and thunderstorms also were scattered from Alabama to
New England.
   On Monday, thunderstorms produced large hail and damaging wind
along the mid-Atlantic coast and in New England. Windsor Locks,
Conn., had wind gusts to 89 mph and Groton, Mass., had gusts to 60
mph.
   Violent thunderstorms in the Chesapeake Bay area left 194,000
homes and business without power in the Baltimore and Washington
areas. Baltimore Gas and Electric planned to distribute dry ice
today to customers without power.
   The storms also knocked out the signal system on the Amtrak line
between Odenton and Perryville in Maryland's Cecil County, delaying
more than a dozen trains for about 90 minutes.
   In Pennsylvania, strong wind tore the tops off trees and left
power lines sagging near Oaksville and Wellsville. A thunderstorm
in southeastern New York produced high wind that toppled several
trees at Millerton. A storm also ripped down power lines in
Aberdeen, Md.
   In the South, storms overnight dropped .75 inches of rain near
Montgomery, Ala., .74 inches at Tuscaloosa, Ala., and .71 inches at
Columbus, Ga.
   Parts of the East continued to swelter under a heat wave Monday,
with New York reaching a record 98 degrees for the date and
Baltimore a record 102.
   The high for the nation Monday was 109 at Palm Springs, Calif.
   The weather was fair early today across the West and in the
north-central United States.
   Today's forecast called for thunderstorms, some possibly severe,
over the Dakotas; showers and thunderstorms from southern New
England to southern Florida, over the lower Appalachians, and
across the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, southern Missouri and
Arkansas; and showers and thunderstorms from Montana to Washington
state.
   High temperatures were expected to be in the 60s and 70s over
the Pacific Northwest and the upper Missouri Valley; 70s to near 80
degrees over the Great Lakes, northern New England and the
California coast; 90s from southern New Jersey through Florida, the
Gulf of Mexico states, southern Plains, western portions of the
central Plains and parts of Nevada and Utah; 100 to 110 degrees
over the desert Southwest; and 80s over the remainder of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 46 at
Marquette, Mich., to 92 at Phoenix, Ariz.

   Farm senators unveiled a legislative blueprint
today for payments of up to $100,000 to prevent heat and lack of
rain from driving crop and livestock producers off their
drought-stricken land.
   ``We're not going to see their lives as farmers and ranchers end
this year because of a freak of nature,'' declared Agriculture
Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., as he unveiled the
measure in a Senate floor speech.
   But Leahy sounded a cautionary note concerning the bill's
timetable.
   ``This legislation will move as quickly through the committee
and the Senate as the members want it to move,'' he said, echoing
statements Monday that reckless speed with the legislation would be
a mistake.
   Farmers and ranchers ``also realize that if we were to try some
politically expedient, zip-through piece of legislation, a lot of
them are going to be left out,'' he told reporters Monday at the
White House.
   Farm lawmakers emerged from a meeting with President Reagan
saying no snags have appeared to slow action on the relief bill
calling for federal disaster payments of up to $100,000 for
drought-stricken crop producers.
   They said Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng told the
president that the measure, which would cancel a 50-cent cut in
dairy prices, is shaping up as ``a pretty good piece'' of
legislation.
   Lyng said Thursday that the need for a bill is now ``urgent''
and House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said Monday that he wanted
floor action this week.
   ``I don't think anybody should put artificial deadlines on it,''
Leahy said. ``The important thing is that you tell people about to
go bankrupt that there is hope, that there will be planting and
raising herds next year.''
   As sketched by congressional sources, both House and Senate
bills would provide disaster payments for drought-stricken
producers of those crops covered by federal farm programs and those
that are not. Payments would amount to 65 percent of pre-drought
expected earnings, whether from target prices, price-support loans
or market prices.
   But they would apply only to losses in excess of 35 percent of
the crop. Any deficiency payments _ income supports provided by the
Agriculture Department _ would be deducted from the disaster
payments, and there would be an array of other limitations. No
individual would be able to receive more than $100,000 under the
legislation.
   For example, a corn producer would receive a disaster payment of
65 percent of the target price of $2.93 a bushel, or $1.90 a bushel
multiplied by the amount of his loss in excess of 35 percent of the
historical yield he has established with the Agriculture Department.
   A farmer with 100 acres planted in corn under the program and a
100-bushel expected yield would receive a disaster payment of
$12,350 under the legislation if his entire crop were wiped out.
   For livestock producers, a number of programs already in effect
would be restructured to take in all types of food animals. The
bill also would allow the secretary of agriculture to depart from
current practice and provide such assistance to farmers who do not
grow their own feed.
   Blazing sun and lack of rainfall have scorched hay across much
of the Farm Belt, and livestock feed is now at a premium. Cattlemen
are complaining that they are obliged to rush to market with their
herds for lack of feed.
   Under the bill, farmers would be allowed to plant soybeans and
sunflowers on 10 percent to 35 percent of a farm's program acreage
without losing the historical wheat, feed grain, cotton and rice
bases they have established with the Agriculture Department for
purposes of taking part in farm programs.
   There have been forecasts of a squeeze in soybeans supplies
because of the drought, and prices already are high.

   A former Navy analyst convicted of
spying for Israel has begun refusing food as a protest against
federal authorities allegedly blocking delivery of his letters, his
father says.
   Jonathan Jay Pollard, sentenced last year to life in prison
without parole, started his hunger strike Friday and is taking only
water, said his father, Morris Pollard.
   The 32-year-old federal inmate says he's protesting federal
authorities' blocking delivery of his letters from prison,
prohibiting visits by his attorney and mistreating his convicted
wife, Morris Pollard said Monday.
   ``We tried to talk him out of it, and he said no, he's going to
go ahead with it,'' said Pollard, a biology professor at the
University of Notre Dame. ``He feels he's reached the end of his
patience.''
   His son has been in regular contact by telephone, he said.
   The younger Pollard is imprisoned at a maximum-security federal
penitentiary at Marion, Ill. He was transferred last month from a
medical facility for convicts at Springfield, Mo., said Pollard.
   Since then, letters have been diverted to Naval Intelligence in
Washington for security checks, but then never forwarded to
addressees, the elder Pollard said.
   ``I know that he sent me letters a month ago, he told me on the
phone,'' he said, adding that they had not arrived.
   Pollard said his son was also protesting inadequate medical
treatment for his wife, Anne Henderson Pollard, also convicted and
imprisoned. Jonathan Pollard complained, too, that he has not been
allowed a visit by his attorney for nearly a year, his father said.
   Randy Davis, executive assistant at the Marion prison, did not
return calls for comment Monday and today. A Navy spokesman in
Washington, Lt. Brian Cullen, said this morning the Navy had no
immediate comment.
   Jonathan Pollard was charged in 1985 with passing classified

   Vice President George Bush, wooing votes at
the NAACP convention, promised today to have a ``positive civil
rights agenda'' and paid tribute to Jesse Jackson ``for running the
race, for being heard.''
   In an appearance before several thousand people at the 79th
convention of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, Bush did not mention reports of Michael Dukakis'
plans to name Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as his running mate on the
Democratic ticket.
   Bush, delivering his speech beneath a banner proclaiming,
``Vote, Be Heard,'' got a warm reception from the audience. He said
he wanted to be heard ``because I do not intend to concede the vote
of any American.''
   The vice president, certain to be the Republican presidential
nominee, said a Bush administration would mark ``a new day'' from
the Reagan administration.
   ``I will have a positive civil rights agenda,'' he pledged.
   ``I guarantee you I will be personally involved in protecting
the civil rights of all Americans,'' Bush said. ``This effort will
be at the top of the agenda of my attorney general, and he or she
will be directly accountable to me for results.''
   The audience applauded loudly.
   Bush also said he had known Jackson, the runner-up in the
Democratic primaries, for a long time in a friendly, personal way.
   ``And I don't have to cover up the differences _ I have profound
differences with Jesse on many of these issues, but I salute him
for running the race, for being heard, and he deserves a salute
from us,'' Bush said, again drawing loud applause from the audience.
   The vice president readily acknowledged that Republicans since
the days of President Franklin D. Roosevelt have not been able to
win much of the black vote.
   However, he pledged that if elected president his decisions
``will not depend on getting a certain percentage of the black
vote. I want to do what is fair. I want to do what is right. And I
want to do what is principled.''
   Bush promised that regardless of the black vote he gets ``you
will be heard, I promise you that. You are going to be called on.
You are going to be partners in my presidency.''
   Jackson is to address the convention tonight and Dukakis is to
speak before it on Wednesday.
   While the Reagan administration has been criticized as being
insensitive to blacks, Bush has a good relationship with some black
leaders and has promised that a Bush administration would have a
positive civil rights agenda.
   By a significant margin, blacks voted for Democrats Walter
Mondale in 1984 and Jimmy Carter in 1980 rather than the
Reagan-Bush ticket. However, in opening the NAACP convention,
Benjamin Hooks, the group's executive director, said it would be a
``fatal mistake'' for Democrats to assume they have the black vote
wrapped up.
   The NAACP is the third special interest group that Bush has
courted this week, following an appearance Sunday before
Lithuanians and before a group of farm writers, editors and
broadcasters on Monday.
   Responding to a question from the audience at the Agricultural
Communicators Congress, meeting in Washington, Bush said he might
consider Senate Republican leader Bob Dole or any of the other
contenders in the Republican primary race as a running mate.
   The vice president said Dole of Kansas was ``deservedly popular
in agricultural America. He knows a great deal about it.''
   ``But I just don't want to start going through long lists or
short lists (of candidates) because believe me, at this juncture,
we don't have them,'' Bush said.
   ``I will say this about Bob Dole. He and I went head on head,''
Bush added. ``So did Pat Robertson and Al Haig and Pete du Pont and
Jack Kemp. ...
   ``My party has never been more unified going into a Republican
convention than we are right now thanks to the way Bob Dole and the
others have been conducting themselves and their sense of
advocacy,'' Bush said. ``So the fact you ran against somebody
certainly in my view would not preclude consideration of that
person.''
   Outlining factors that will influence his decision, Bush said
the fundamental criteria will be who _ man or woman _ is best
qualified to take over if something happens to the president.
   ``I would want a certain philosophical compatability to be
there,'' he said. ``Then I will do what all politicians do _ throw
a little bit of seasoning in there for geography.'' However, Bush
said that factor was not important as it has been.
   ``I'll look who the Democrats pick and then we will have
procedures for selecting, and they will be, getting, soliciting
opinion from the senators, the Republicans and members of the
Republican National Committeee and congressmen and governors and
all of that.
   ``And that will probably be done by the Republican National
Committee,'' Bush said. ``Sometimes that's been done in the past.
   ``And then I will make a very personal decision,'' he added.
   In a speech that he billed as non-partisan, Bush nevertheless
took several jabs at Dukakis, saying, ``I am not the one who feels
that the problems of agricultural America can be solved by planting
more belgian endive.''
   He also said a Bush administration would help farmers export
more crops, ``not force farmers to produce less. That is the major
difference.''

   Public Order Minister Anastasios Sehiotis
today released pictures of three men allegedly involved in a
terrorist attack aboard a Greek cruise ship that left 11 people
dead and 98 injured.
   Government sources said today that a woman also was involved in
Monday's attack and was photographed on the ship. Her photograph
was not made public by Sehiotis, but also was being distributed to
airports, border entry points and harbors around Greece, said the
sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Authorities had said three men hurled grenades and fired
automatic weapons Monday at terrified passengers aboard the City of
Poros cruise ship. Police said the assailants fled in a speedboat.
   Greek authorities speculated the attack was part of a failed
attempt by pro-Iranian Arab terrorists to hijack foreign tourists
taking a island-hopping cruise on the Greek-owned ship.
   There was no claim of responsibility for the assault. At least
one passenger said a gunman spoke what sounded like Arabic.
   Sehiotis indicated the ship attack was linked to an explosion
earlier Monday that killed two men in a rental car near the
Trocadero Marina, home marina for the City of Poros.
   Despite repeated questioning by Greek reporters, the minister
declined to give any more details other than the names of two
Lebanese men ``being sought as involved in this attack.''
   He identified them as Hamoud Abdul Hamid, 36, of Lebanon, who
rented the car and Mohammed Zozad, 21, thought to be one of the
terrorists on the ship. The minister said both had been in Greece
since May.
   A Piraeus harbor authority officer, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said he believed the attack was staged by two men and
two women who boarded the cruise ship after it stopped at the
island of Aegina.
   He said survivors had recognized Zozad in the picture as well as
a young woman in another photograph taken aboard the ship. He did
not say if a picture was taken of the other woman or if the picture
of the other man was the same as that released by Greek officials.
   Rescuers today pulled a body from the Aegean Sea and a second
was found on the cruise ship. Nine bodies were recovered earlier,
and officials said the casualty count was expected to keep rising.
   ``We also have found some floating body remains that indicate
the death toll could go higher,'' said a harbor authority officer
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The ship attack occurred at 8:40 a.m., six hours after an
explosives-packed car blew up near the Trocadero Marina, police
said.
   Police said they found an Iranian magazine in the wrecked car.
They said the vehicle contained hand grenades and automatic weapons.
   Terrified passengers scurried for cover and leaped into the sea
when the gunmen hurled grenades and sprayed gunfire at the tourists
on the crowded vessel. The grenade blasts started a fire and a deck
collapsed aboard the ship.
   The ship, about 16 miles out, was returning to the Trocadero
Marina in the Athens port of Piraeus from a daylong cruise.
   Although the harbor authority reported some bodies may have not
been recovered, a Merchant Marine Ministry spokesman said all 471
passengers and 22 crew members had been accounted for today.
   The ministry said that 28 of the 98 originally reported as
wounded remained hospitalized today.
   By today, authorities had released the names of only two of the
dead: Antonis Demaizis, the ship's 45-year-old first mate, and a
Danish tourist, 33-year-old Karl Johan Grabas.
   ``I was on deck when I heard automatic fire,'' Jean Wogewda of
Lorient, France, said from his bed in a Piraeus hospital, where he
was recovering from gunshot wounds in both legs. ``I turned around
and was thrown into the air by the impact of the bullets hitting my
leg.''
   Another French passenger, Andre Gelia, told reporters that ``a
thin man in white with a dark complexion and dark hair jumped up
from his seat ... and started yelling in what sounded like Arabic.
   Gelia said the gunman took a submachine gun out of his backpack
and fired it at passengers. ``Then he said a few more words in
Arabic, took out one or two hand grenades out of the backpack and
tossed them. That's all I remember,'' Gelia said.
   Pouring black smoke, the City of Poros steamed back to Piraeus.
   The ministry spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the wounded included 34 French, 3 Jordanians, 3 Danes, 2
Britons, 2 Norwegians, 1 Moroccan, 1 Swiss and 1 Swede.
   Seven Americans were on the cruise, but none were among the
injured, he said.
   The ministry spokesman said the ship attack could be linked with
a trial starting in Greece on Wednesday of a Palestinian wanted in
the United States for allegedly bombing a Pan Am jetliner over
Hawaii in 1982. A Japanese teen-ager died in the blast and 15
people were injured.
   The Palestinian, Mohammed Rashid, was arrested at Athens Airport
last month. He is to be tried on charges of entering Greece on a
false passport, but the government has said it will consider a U.S.
request for his extradition.
   In October 1985, Palestinian terrorists hijacked the Italian
cruise ship Achille Lauro during a Mediterranean cruise. They
killed a 69-year-old American passenger, Leon Klinghoffer. Seven
Palestinians were convicted in the attack.

   Nine of the 11 refrigerators in the city
morgue broke again, and the stench of decomposing bodies filled the
courthouse.
   ``The boxes are old and they are constantly going out. Three
went out last week and over the weekend another six went out,''
said chief coroner's investigator John Gagliano.
   Four unidentified, decomposing bodies remained despite the
broken refrigerators because they were not be accepted by a
hospital, he said.
   Gagliano said the coroner's office has been waiting for the city
to install a walk-in cooler, approved by voters 2{ years ago in a
bond issue. ``The city's dragging its feet,'' he said.
   But Assistant Chief Administrative Officer Leonard Simmons said
the administration of Mayor Sidney Barthelemy is not to blame. Work
would be further along if the coroner's office hadn't insisted on
design changes, he said.

   defense and foreign policy and Washington experience,'' all
considered crucial to a Democratic victory in Florida.
   Even backers of Jesse Jackson, who came in second to Dukakis in
the race for the presidential nomination and who had been one of
those the Massachusetts governor had considered for the second
spot, seemed satisfied with Bentsen.
   Florida state Rep. James Burke, who was the state campaign
coordinator for Jackson, said, ``We would have preferred to have
had Jesse.'' He added, though, that ``Bentsen is a better choice
than some of the others he could have picked.''
   John White, a former Democratic national chairman who has been
advising Jackson, said he was ``excited'' about the choice of
Bentsen and said it would ``make Texas a hell of a battlefield.''
   Union activists also praised Bentsen, saying that the Texas
senator had recently shored up his poor record on labor issues with
his deft handling of the trade bill and mandatory plant closing and
layoff notices _ some of labor's top legislative priorities this
year.
   ``Bentsen was extremely helpful in recognizing that the two _
plant closing notices and the trade bill _ were compatible,'' said
Robert McGlotten, legislative director for the AFL-CIO. ``And he
let his colleagues know how he felt.''
   Geraldine Ferraro, who four years ago was picked as Democrat
Walter Mondale's running mate, said she was ``delighted'' at the
choice of Bentsen.
   ``I think it's an indication that Governor Dukakis intends to
run a strong national campaign,'' Ms. Ferraro said.
   On the Republican side, Senate Minority leader Bob Dole of
Kansas, frequently mentioned as a possible vice president on Bush's
ticket, said he thought Dukakis ``couldn't have picked a better
man.''
   Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., who is national co-chairwoman of
Bush's presidential campaign, called Bentsen ``a nice man who's
able'' but said she still anticipated that Bush would be able to
carry Texas.
   On the similarity to the Kennedy-Johnson ticket of 1960, she
said: ``I'm sure we're going to hear 1960 ad nauseum. There's a
slight difference of course. He (Bentsen) was not selected by his
peers to be in leadership (as Lyndon Johnson, the Senate majority
leader, had been); nor is Dukakis John Kennedy.''

   Security was especially tight in one cell
in the Oakland County Jail, where three sheriff's officers spent 45
minutes locked inside after scuffling with an inmate.
   The inmate was alone when he tore a telephone from a wall of the
holding cell on Friday.
   The first officer entered the cell and the inmate punched him in
the face. A second officer came to help, and all three scuffled. A
third officer arrived and put her foot in the cell door. She
grabbed the inmate's leg and was pulled inside, too.
   The door automatically locked shut, leaving the foursome inside
with no telephone.
   Southfield police arrived 45 minutes later to book a prisoner,
and the officers were freed, Southfield Officer Gary Conat said.
   The inmate, who was not identified, proved a less than gracious
host, sheriff's Lt. Jerry Girard said.
   ``When the Southfield police finally get upstairs and the
officers are released, the inmate's on the floor, snoring,'' Girard
said. ``He was sound asleep.''

   Benjamin ``Benny'' Begin brings the looks and
mannerisms of his father, former Prime Minister Menachem Begin, to
his run for parliament and the nostalgia factor could be important
for both him and his party.
   Benny Begin, a 45-year-old government geologist, is the first
son of an Israeli prime minister to run for office. He was chosen
this month as a candidate of the Likud bloc, the right-wing
alliance his father founded, in the Nov. 1 elections.
   He is taller and leaner but the hand and facial gestures, some
of his rhetorical flourishes and even his tone of voice are almost
identical to his father's.
   Party officials believe the Begin name on Likud's list could
help it win what promises to be a close contest with the
center-left Labor Party of Foreign Minister Shimon Peres for
control of the Knesset, the 120-seat parliament.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Benny Begin insisted
he cannot fill his father's shoes.
   ``It is unreasonable to hang hopes on me because my name is
Begin,'' he said. ``People like him are born very rarely.''
   Begin said he sees little chance for territorial compromise or a
peace agreement with neighboring Jordan, so believes like his
father that Israel should keep control of the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
   ``I am not a prophet of doom,'' he said with a smile. ``I look
at all the alternatives and seek the lesser evil, the one that
doesn't endanger Israel's survival, which means maintaining
absolute Israeli control over the land of Israel west of the Jordan
River.''
   Menachem Begin, 74, was born in Poland. His mix of charm and
fiery rhetoric proved a winning formula for ending three decades of
Labor Party government in 1977.
   In 1978 he shared the Nobel Peace Prize with the late Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat for the process leading to their peace treaty
the next year, then resigned suddenly in 1983 and has been a
recluse since.
   Associates and friends said Begin resigned because he was
depressed about Israel's loss of more than 650 soldiers in the
invasion of Lebanon, which began under his leadership in 1982.
   Benny Begin refuses to speak about his father except to say,
``He's feeling fine, thank you'' and acknowledge the former prime
minister as the source of his political aspirations.
   When interviewed during a party meeting at a country club in
Herzliya, a seaside town, the younger Begin focused on his own
political views. He delivered them with the same rhetorical style
and sense of Jewish history as his father, pausing occasionally to
sip grapefruit juice from a can or shake hands with well-wishers.
   He condemned the 7-month-old Palestinian rebellion in the West
Bank and Gaza, which Israel has occupied since capturing them from
Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 war.
   ``The Arabs call it the `intefadeh,' or uprising, but they are
simply riots,'' he said. ``That's what they should be called. It is
clear that this is a new method to carry out an old goal of the
Arab nation to expel the Jews from the land of Israel.''
   Benny Begin characterized tough army measures used to quell Arab
unrest as ``reasonable force'' and disputed the Labor Party's
contention that a political process would resolve the conflict.
   ``There is no political solution,'' he said, and a Palestinian
state in the occupied territories ``would be another terrorist
state between Libya and Syria which would try to take over all of
Israel.''
   ``As long as the Arab nation doesn't relinquish its plan to
destroy the land of Israel, there will unfortunately be no peaceful
solution,'' Begin declared.
   The son was born in Israel and, unlike his father, rarely
invokes the Nazi Holocaust as a rationale for his political views.
He also is more soft-spoken.
   He has a doctorate in geology from Colorado State University and
for the past decade has been studying the viability of building a
nuclear power plant in the Negev desert. Begin said his role was to
determine the risk of an earthquake in the area that could cause a
nuclear disaster.
   Benny Begin has four daughters and two sons aged eight to 23.
His wife, Ruth, 45, is a social worker for the Defense Ministry who
deals with people wounded in Israel's wars.

   President Reagan today picked a ``tough-minded

succeed Edwin Meese III as attorney general.
   Thornburgh, a squeaky clean ex-prosecutor with a reputation for
staying cool under fire, declined comment on the troubles of Meese,
who has been dogged by questions about his ethics and who announced
last week that he had been exonerated by a special prosecutor and
would leave office Aug. 1.
   Thornburgh said, ``I think it is important to look forward
rather than back. I think what we will try to do is to carry out a
full-bore effort in the law enforcement area.''
   Asked if he would have to look into investigations of Meese,
Thornburgh at first declined to answer, then added, ``My intention
in this as in any areas is to follow the evidence wherever it may
lead.''
   Meese could still face an internal department review of his
actions.
   Reagan, who appeared with Thornburgh in the White House briefing
room, called Thornburgh ``the ideal choice for attorney general.
   ``I urge the Senate to move quickly to confirm him as well as
our other Justice Department nominees so they can roll up their
sleeves and get to work enforcing the laws of the land.''
   Also awaiting Senate confirmation are the deputy attorney
general, Harold Christensen; the No. 3 person in the department,
Associate Attorney General Francis Keating, and the criminal
division chief, Edward Dennis.
   Christensen and Dennis have been on the job since early June;
Keating has been at work about a month longer. All were appointed
on an acting basis by Reagan.
   There appeared to little opposition in the Senate to the
nomination.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, the No. 2 Demcorat on
the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will review Thornburgh's
nomination, said he expected a rapid confirmation.
   ``I have the greatest respect for Dick Thornburgh,'' Kennedy
said. ``The state of justice in America would be very different
today if Dick Thornburgh had been attorney general for the past 3{
years instead of Ed Meese.''
   Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, the panel's ranking
Republican, priaded Thornburgh's ``deep intellect and unmatched
integrity.''
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole proclaimed Thornburgh ``a
tough man for a tough job'' and said the selection ``deserves
speedy Senate confirmation,''
   Reagan told reporters that Thornburgh ``was a prosecutor's
prosecutor for six years as a United States attorney for Western
Pennsylvania, a tough-minded crime buster winning an unprecedented
number of convictions for corruption and against members of
organized crime.''
   Reagan said that, as governor for eight years, Thornburgh ``won
tough mandatory jail terms for violent and repeat criminals. He was
in the forefront of the war against drugs, cracking down on drug
traffickers and creating preventive eduction programs for
Pennsylvania school children.''
   News of the nomination cheered officials with Vice President
George Bush's presidential campaign, who had worried aloud about
political damage to the certain Republican nominee from the
persistent questions over Meese's ethics.
   Thornburgh, 55, earned a reputation for methodical, steady
leadership in 1979 when, after only 72 days as governor, he was
faced with the nation's worst commercial nuclear accident, at Three
Mile Island near Harrisburg.
   Six years later, he said he learned several lessons from the
accident. They included: forget partisanship during crises, don't
be afraid to ``scramble the organization chart,'' and ``respect but
do not depend on the news media.''
   But it is Thornburgh's ability as a prosecutor that set him
apart from other attorney general candidates, according to several
of his former aides. As U.S. attorney for western Pennsylvania,
Thornburgh's attacks on organized cime, public corruption and drug
trafficking led to his 1975 appointment by President Ford as
assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's
criminal division.
   At the Justice Department, Thornburgh credits himself in a
biography with ``enhancing the effort to combat organized crime and
public corruption nationwide.'' As a prosecutor, his targets
included a U.S. customs agent, a county sheriff and a former GOP
congressman, J. Irving Whalley, who was convicted in a kickback
case.
   Thornburgh's calm handling of the TMI nuclear plant accident was
recalled Monday by Sen. Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo., a member of the
Senate Judiciary Committee.
   ``I saw him handle that with maturity and skill. He dealt
honestly with the issue, without emotion or hysteria. He has a fine
grasp of government,'' Simpson said.
   Barred by law from seeking a third term as governor, Thornburgh
left Pennsylvania at the end of 1986 to head the Institute of
Politics at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.
   In the last several days, Republican Sens. John Heinz and Arlen
Specter of Pennsylvania and others familiar with Thornburgh have
been questioned about him by White House officials. A former
Thornburgh aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, told of being
asked about Thornburgh's views on abortion and replying that those
views were not incompatible with the administration's.
   Thornburgh vetoed an anti-abortion bill in 1981, saying it was
excessively restrictive, but later signed a weakened version of the
measure.
   As governor, Thornburgh frequently testified on Capitol Hill on
behalf of the president's proposal for line-item veto power and a
constitutional amendment to balance the budget.
   He turned down earlier offers from the Reagan White House to
head the FBI and Agency for International Development. Thornburgh
had also been mentioned as a possible running mate for Bush.
   Meese has been under fire since his arrival in Washington over a
succession of ethical questions. He announced his decision to leave
the Justice Department on the same day last week that independent
counsel James McKay wound up a 14-month criminal investigation of
the attorney general.
   McKay declined to prosecute, but portions of his sealed report
on the investigation reportedly question Meese's candor and ethics.

<HEAD>White Activists To Participate In Municipal Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A white anti-apartheid
coalition said Tuesday it would not adopt the election boycott
strategy of black activists and instead would try to elect
pro-integration candidates in municipal elections.
   The Five Freedoms Forum, which represents 25 human rights and
religious groups, said the focus of its campaign would be to elect
an anti-apartheid municipal council in Johannesburg, the country's
largest city.
   Segregated elections for councils in white, black, mixed-race
and Asian communities are scheduled nationwide for Oct. 26, the
first time voters of all races will go to the polls on the same day.
   The government has outlawed public calls for an election
boycott, but black activists have said they oppose participation in
any elections until South Africa's 26 million blacks are given
voting rights on the national level.
   Prominent anti-apartheid clergymen two weeks ago defied the
government ban and urged South Africans not to vote in October.
   The Five Freedoms Forum, in a statement, said it was not
criticizing those who favored a boycott of the elections.
   ``The Johannesburg City Council, as a whites-only body, is a
structure infected with the racism implicit in the government's
apartheid policy,'' the statement said. ``However, despite the
inadequacy of these structures, we do not believe that any purpose
would be served by calling on whites to boycott.''
   The statement said the elections could be used as a vehicle for
campaigning against apartheid laws such as the Group Areas Act,
which establishes racially segregated residential districts.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a segregated society in
which the blacks have no vote in national affairs, controlled by
the 5 million whites.
   The government is spending more than $2 million on an
advertising campaign to promote participation in the elections.
   Officials of Transvaal Province, which includes Johannesburg and
Pretoria, on Tuesday called on employers to help their black
workers register to vote by obtaining forms that could be filled
out at workplaces.

   Superpower arms talks resumed Tuesday after a
seven-week break, and the chief U.S. negotiator played down hopes
for a breakthrough on a treaty slashing long-range nuclear arsenals.
   Disagreement at the negotiations, which began in March 1985,
centers on U.S. plans for a space-based missile defense and Soviet
insistence on limiting sea-launched cruise missiles. Many
anti-cheating provisions also remain open in a draft agreement of
more than 300 pages.
   U.S. and Soviet teams held a two-hour plenary meeting at the
U.S. mission to launch the 10th round of talks, for which no end
has been set. The talks had recessed for the Moscow summit.
   A source close to the talks who demanded anonymity called the
initial two-hour session ``productive'' but declined to say if new
proposals were made. ``Some interesting things were said,'' the
source said, refusing to elaborate.
   Before the opening session, chief U.S. negotiator Max Kampelman
reaffirmed Washington's stand that the draft pact halving each
side's strategic stockpile ``should not be held hostage'' to limits
sought by Moscow on President Reagan's missile defense program, the
Strategic Defense Initiative.
   Asked whether a possible fifth superpower summit or the end of
Reagan's presidency in January could be target dates for agreement,
Kampelman said talks will ``continue no matter who is president and
no matter who the leader of the Soviet Union is.''
   ``I don't think important issues should be governed by the
calendar,'' he told reporters before the opening session. ``If it
takes longer fine, if it takes shorter fine.''
   Kampelman said on Monday that an agreement was still possible
under the Reagan administration. He and his top two aides were to
brief NATO allies on Wednesday in Brussels on the start of the
talks. The negotiations are to continue Wednesday or Thursday, the
U.S. side said.
   At the May 29-June 2 summit in Moscow, Reagan and General
Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev ordered negotiators to continue
``energetically and purposefully'' after the two leaders made only
limited progress on arms control.
   Kampelman told reporters Monday: ``Don't look for drama. We're
at a stage now where hard work is required rather than drama.''
   Soviet chief delegate Alexei Obukhov said on Sunday the talks
must not lose momentum.
   Both said the talks have come ``a long way'' but Kampelman noted
much still remains to be resolved.
   Washington and Moscow agree the proposed Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty should cut each side's stocks over seven years to
an overall limit of 6,000 nuclear warheads and 1,600 launchers,
such as heavy bombers and land-based intercontinental missiles.
   Some details of monitoring compliance are also set.
   But Obukhov said progress was imperative on a renewed
U.S.-Soviet commitment to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty,
which Moscow says is threatened by Strategic Defense Initiative,
also known as SDI.
   Reagan says SDI does not violate the ABM pact, and Kampelman
reaffirmed the U.S. side will not allow Moscow ``to use these
negotiations to have us end our Strategic Defense Initiative.''
   The Geneva negotiators have yet to agree on a joint text
pledging each side to observe the ABM treaty for a certain period.
   Obukhov also pressed for limits on long-range, sea-launched
cruise missiles and verification measures including inspections of
warships.
   Washington has balked, saying the weapons cannot be reliably
detected. U.S. START negotiator Steven Hanmer called Soviet
verification proposals ``totally impractical'' and said current
prospects for resolving the issue are dim.

   A bus packed with hikers plunged off a
mountain highway Tuesday in northern Taiwan, killing at least 14
passengers and injuring 34, police said.
   The bus tumbled 200 feet down a deep valley from a steep road in
Balin, Taoyuan, 30 miles south of Taipei, police said.
   Taoyuan police reported 14 people died, but the Central News
Agency put the death toll at 17. The police, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said about 10 of the injured people were seriously
hurt.
   Police said the bus, which was more than 10 years old, did not
have enough power to climb the mountain road and slid back,
tumbling into the valley.
   The bus was carrying the Taiwanese passengers to a mountain stop
from where they were to begin hiking, police said. There were no
foreigners on the bus.

   Teamsters President Jackie
Presser was praised at his funeral today as a major civic force in
Cleveland and as a ``tough guy'' with heart.
   The executive committee of the Teamsters union and about 800
other people listened as Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, commended
Presser for his appearances before a Senate committee.
   ``He wanted people to know that there were people in the
Teamsters willing to stand up and face the public,'' said Hatch,
who chaired the hearings before the Labor and Human Relations
Committee. ``He believed in the labor movement, and he wasn't
afraid to stand up and say so.''
   Presser, he said, ``was a tough guy but one with a heart. He
laughed infectiously at bitter taunts that would hurt lesser men.''
   Among those greeting guests as they entered was Harold Friedman,
international vice president and president of Presser's own Local
507. Friedman was charged with Presser in a $700,000
payroll-padding scheme at Local 507 and still is awaiting trial.
   Presser was also a defendant in a U.S. District Court lawsuit
filed two weeks ago in an attempt by the U.S. government to take
over the Teamsters and rid the union of alleged Mafia domination.
   Cleveland Mayor George Voinovich described Presser as a major
civic force for Cleveland and praised him for his assistance in
helping the city out of default. Presser was vice president of a
state-appointed commission that oversaw Cleveland finances until it
rose out of default a year ago.
   Acting President Weldon Mathis and the other union leaders made
no comment as they entered the packed Berkowitz-Kumin Chapel.
Presser's casket was at the front of the chapel, which was draped
with flowers.
   Presser, 61, who died Saturday, had been battling brain cancer
and a lung clot. Although his union has been criticized by federal
officials, Presser was remembered by local leaders in his hometown
of Cleveland as a man dedicated to the city.
   ``He never had Cleveland out of his consciousness, even when he
was outside Cleveland and traveling around the world,'' Mike Benz,
executive vice president of the Greater Cleveland Growth
Association, said Monday.
   A native of Cleveland who has been involved in organized labor
most of his adult life, Presser made a big mark on the community 18
years ago when he helped found the United Labor Agency, an
organization to help needy local residents, said Michael J. Murphy,
the agency's executive director.
   The union leadership indicated earlier that it might announce a
date to select Presser's successor as president of the
1.6-million-member union after today's services.
   The payroll-padding trial had been scheduled to start today but
was postponed because of Presser's battle with brain cancer.
   Presser denied ever being controlled by the mob. He said he was
an FBI informant and that the FBI authorized the hiring of ``ghost
employees'' at Local 507.

   Policemen blew up a briefcase
which they removed from a car parked in front of a jail, only to
discover it belonged to a minister and contained his Bible, a news
agency said Tuesday.
   The incident occurred last week in the northern town of Brits,
the South African Press Association said.
   The news agency said Henry Jackman, a minister of the Dutch
Reformed Church, parked his car outside the jail and walked away
with a friend.
   Police said they forced open the trunk of the car because the
vehicle ``was parked in a questionable place and under suspicious
conditions.''
   Concerned that the briefcase found in the trunk might contain
explosives, the officers took it to a safe location and blew it up.
It contained Jackman's Bible and several documents.
   Jackman, a former policeman, said the officers had been ``very
thorough.''

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of three vials that washed ashore last
week on New York beaches contained human blood infected with the
AIDS virus, state Health Commissioner Dr. David Axelrod said today.
   Axelrod said the sample, discovered on Lido Beach about 20 miles
east of New York City, also tested positive for hepatitis at the
state Health Department laboratory in Albany.
   Another vial, found on a beach about 40 miles east of the city,
contained blood that tested both positive and negative for the
virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome, Axelrod said.
   A third vial tested negative, the health commissioner said.
   Axelrod said the chances of beachgoers getting infected with the
AIDS virus or hepatitis, by either stepping on the vials and being
cut by broken glass or from blood spilled on the beach or in the
water, are ``remote.''
   Neither virus can survive for long outside the human body, and
the sample that tested positive for the AIDS virus is believed to
be inactive.
   ``The conditions to which the infected samples were exposed
almost certainly destroyed most if not all the active virus,''
Axelrod said.
   While the results ``confirm some of our fears'' about the danger
of the material that washed up on Long Island beaches, Axelrod said
``we do not feel the presence of these materials represent a
significant public health hazard.''
   Axelrod said investigators do not yet know where the vials
originated or how long they were in the water. But the commissioner
said they are of a design that is ``clearly associated with the
medical establishment.''
   The vials could have come from a doctor's office, medical
research facility or a hospital, he said.
   The discovery of blood samples and other medical debris
temporarily closed some of Long Island's most popular beaches late
last week in the midst of a prolonged heat wave. When the beaches
reopened over the weekend, attendance was cut in half in many
places.
   As of today, all beaches on Long Island and in New York City
were open except for a 1.4-mile stretch of Staten Island's Midland
Beach.

   Police attacked and arrested steel workers
who threatened to strike during Mikhail S. Gorbachev's visit, and
today surrounded a church where some workers took refuge,
opposition activists said.
   A government spokesman confirmed a ``conflict-prone situation''
at the church, and said at least one person was temporarily
detained after the incident Monday night in the southeastern city
of Stalowa Wola. But he denied any organized police attack.
   Ewa Tomaszewska, a spokesman for the banned Solidarity trade
union movement, said an undetermined number of people were detained.
   ``We suspect that the action is an act of revenge for a rally
that took place July 7,'' said Zbigniew Romaszewski, who monitors
human rights for Solidarity.
   About 50 people retreated into the grounds of the church, said
Romaszewski and Tomaszewska. About a dozen remained there today,
said Ewa Kaberna, a Solidarity activist in the city, speaking in a
phone call from the church.
   Police in Poland rarely enter church grounds to make detentions.
   ``Conflict-prone situations did arise there yesterday ... But I
can say that there were no major disturbances,'' said a government
press spokesman, Ryszard Strauss.
   But he added, ``I cannot say that not a single policeman used
his truncheon because I was not there.''
   There was no effect on work at the Stalowa Wola steel mill,
where the workers are employed, he said.
   Strauss said police moved in when members of the Solidarity
committee of the mill attempted to launch a rally outside the
church. He denied a report that riot police were involved and said
only normal patrols were continuing at the church Tuesday.
   A strike occurred at the mill April 29-30 during Poland's worst
wave of labor unrest since the December 1981 military crackdown
that stifled Solidarity.
   About 4,000 Stalowa Wola workers were reported by Solidarity
spokesmen to have rallied Thursday to demand reinstatement of seven
dismissed members of the April strike committee.
   Rally organizers said that if the seven were not rehired, they
would call a strike during the Gorbachev visit. The Soviet leader
and his wife Raisa arrived Monday and are scheduled to stay until
Saturday.
   Today, they were visiting the southern city of Krakow.
   Tomaszewska said a strike at the Stalowa Wola mill was expected
``in the upcoming days,'' but no date had been set.

<HEAD>Senate OKs Cabinet Status for VA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an election-year bow to an agency that
serves one-third of all Americans, the Senate voted Tuesday to give
the Veterans Administration a seat in the president's Cabinet.
   The bill was passed by an 84-11 vote. The House approved similar
legislation last November, a week after the idea was advanced by
President Reagan. Negotiators from the the Senate and House will
work out minor differences between the two bills.
   The Department of Veterans' Affairs would become the 14th in the
Cabinet and the fifth addition since 1960. The change would take
effect Jan. 1, 1989.
   Sponsors said veterans and their dependents deserve to be heard
in the highest councils of government. Opponents called the bill
another example of congressional pandering to special interests.
   ``In recent years the VA has frequently been relegated to a
relatively insignificant role within the executive branch, with the
administrator having little or no access to the president or other
top officials in the White House,'' said Sen. Alan Cranston,
D-Calif., chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., who has been promoting a veterans'
department since 1975, said his support is not aimed at getting
more money for veterans. ``Given the nature and scope of the VA, it
is appropriate that we make it an executive department ... (to)
ensure that these federal dollars are more effectively
administered.''
   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., a former Veterans Committee chairman,
opposed creation of the Cabinet seat. He bitterly criticized some
veterans' service organizations for supporting the bill while they
fought another measure, passed Monday by the Senate, that would
allow courts to overturn some VA decisions on veterans' benefits.
   ``If anybody believes veterans needed a stronger voice ... than
they already have, then I've missed something in the nine years
I've been year,'' Simpson said.
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., called the bill ``absurd...
silly... goofy... illogical ... irresponsible. This is rubbish.
This is unprincipled (prostitution) after special-interest groups.''
   According to the Veterans' Affairs Committee, VA serves 27
million veterans and 49 million dependents or survivors with a
budget of $30 billion, making it the largest independent federal
agency. It will dispense $14 billion in income maintenance and $626
million for education and rehabilitation assistance this year.
   The agency and its 240,000 employees administered 90,000 patient
beds in 534 health facilities and will see 20 million outpatients
this year. It runs 109 national cemeteries and will bury 300,000
veterans this year.
   The Congressional Budget Office estimated that converting the VA
into a Cabinet department would cost $33 million over five years.
The biggest part of the cost would go for changing signs on VA
buildings.
   The bill would reorganize VA operations and allow the secretary
of veterans' affairs to name up to four assistant secretaries and
15 deputy assistants. The legislation requires that the top
operating officers _ the chief medical director and chief benefits
director _ be selected on the basic of expertise and without regard
to politics.
   Voting against elevating VA to the Cabinet were Sens. William
Armstrong, R-Colo.; Dan Evans, R-Wash.; Jake Garn, R-Utah;
Humphrey; Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan.; James McClure, R-Idaho; William
Proxmire, D-Wis.; Dan Quayle, R-Ind.; Warren Rudman, R-N.H.;
Simpson, and Steven Symms, R-Idaho.
   Not voting were Sens. Joseph Biden, D-Del.; Orrin Hatch, R-Utah;
Jesse Helms, R-N.C.; Paul Trible, R-Va., and John Warner, R-Va.

   Faneuil Hall, the historic building picked by
Michael Dukakis to introduce Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as his
running mate, has been a centerpiece of both the American
Revolution and of a modern economic revival.
   A box-shaped brick structure with a steeple crowned by a
grasshopper weathervane, the Great Hall in Faneuil Hall, as it is
formally known, was built in 1742 as a gift to the city by merchant
Peter Faneuil.
   It earned the nickname ``The Cradle of Liberty'' as a forum for
revolutionaries grousing about the taxation policies of the British
Empire and plotting their revolt.
   Later it was the staging ground for anti-slavery, temperance and
women's suffrage rallies. Among speakers who stood there were
Frederick Douglass, Daniel Webster and Susan B. Anthony.
   Still much in use for public celebrations and political
speeches, it was here that Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., announced
his candidacy for the presidential nomination in November 1979.
   Dukakis has also stood on this stage before. The 900-seat hall
just 100 feet from Boston Harbor was the background for some
tapings of ``The Advocates,'' a public affairs TV program he
moderated in 1970-73, before he became governor of Massachusetts.
   The building, owned by the city and maintained by the National
Park Service, became the anchor of a 1970s refurbishment of the
Faneuil Hall Marketplace, a cobblestoned mall of boutiques, food
stalls and souvenir vendors. It is one of the nation's most visited
tourist attractions.

<HEAD>Vietnam To Turn Over More U.S. Remains</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A U.S. military team goes to Vietnam on
Wednesday to pick up what may be the remains of 25 missing American
servicemen.
   It will be one of the largest shipments of remains given to U.S.
officials since U.S. forces withdrew from Vietnam in 1973.
   The remains are to be loaded onto a U.S. C-141 transport plane
during a simple military ceremony, then flown to U.S. Army
laboratories in Honolulu for analysis, Lt. Col. Paul Mather said on
Tuesday.
   Mather is leading the team of about 20 personnel from the Joint
Casualty Resolution Center and the Army Central Identification
Laboratory.
   Mather, head of the resolution center's office in Bangkok, said
the Vietnamese have not given him any details about the remains.
   ``The U.S. government appreciates the initiative taken by
Vietnam to repatriate these remains and hopes it represents just
one of many continued steps to resolve this long-standing
humanitarian issue,'' a U.S. Embassy statement said.
   The shipment of remains will be the fifth since retired Gen.
John W. Vessey, acting as a special presidential envoy, reached an
agreement in Hanoi in August under which Vietnam agreed to speed up
the search for remains.
   In return, Washington sent several medical teams to explore how
private U.S. agencies could help Vietnamese, including veterans
disabled in the war against the United States. Washington doesn't
give official aid because of Vietnam's military occupation of
Cambodia.
   About 58,000 Americans lost their lives before U.S. forces
withdrew from South Vietnam in 1973. The North Vietnamese
communists won the war in a lightning offensive in April 1975.
   The last shipment of remains, on April 6, was the largest ever.
Vietnam returned 27 sets of remains it tentatively identified as
those of Americans, and three other sets which it said were those
of ethnic Asians who might possibly be among the missing Americans.
   Vietnam has returned more than 150 sets of remains that have
been confirmed as those of Americans. The lack of diplomatic
relations with the United States has hindered progress, and 1,761
Americans remain unaccounted for.

<HEAD>U.S. Wants Review Of ABM Pact, But Soviets Have Not Replied</HEAD>

   The United States has proposed to the Soviet
Union a review be held soon of the 1972 treaty that restricts the
two superpowers' defenses against ballistic missiles, but Moscow
has not replied, a U.S. official said Tuesday.
   The review would set the stage for a decision by President
Reagan on whether to scrap the accord, considered a main pillar of
arms control efforts and a restraint on his quest for a space-based
defense against Soviet rockets.
   The treaty states that a review conference be held every five
years. The U.S. proposal is that it be held in Geneva, beginning on
Friday or next Monday, said the U.S. official, who spoke only on
condition of anonymity.
   Since the Soviets have not replied yet, it is unlikely to be
held that quickly even if the response is favorable, the official
said.
   In the meantime, Reagan has to decide whether the Soviets'
phased-array radar station at Krasnoyarsk is a ``material breach''
of the treaty. His senior advisers discussed the issue at an
unpublicized meeting last week of the National Security Planning
Group and did not reach a consensus.
   In two reports to Congress, the president has charged the radar
stations violated restrictions imposed by the treaty. But that does
not mean he will conclude the pact should be scrapped.
   Some of his advisers are known to be suggesting Reagan try to
persuade the Soviets to level the Krasnoyarsk facility in the
interest of preserving the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
   More hard-line advisers reportedly are recommending he accuse
the Soviets of a ``material breach'' of the pact and abrogate it.
   Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, declined on Monday
to discuss the options presented to Reagan. ``No decision has been
made,'' the spokesman said. ``The issue is under review.''
   Fitzwater said `'there are sound and valid arguments on both
sides of the question'' and that Reagan would make a decision
``before the review.''
   The treaty constrains defenses against ballistic missiles on the
theory a potential aggressor might hold back if his country faced
retaliatory devastation.
   The Soviets have denied Reagan's accusation that Krasnoyarsk is
a treaty infraction, but many American analysts who question the
president's views on other arms control issues concur in his
judgment about Krasnoyarask.
   In the meantime, the treaty limits how fast and far the United
States can go in its search for a space-based defense against
ballistic missiles that uses such sophisticated technology as laser
beams and kinetic energy.
   The program, known formally as the Strategic Defense Initiative,
is being carried out under what the Reagan administration describes
as a ``strict interpretation'' of the 1972 treaty. A broader
interpretation would provide more leeway and scrapping the treaty
would remove all legal restraints.

<HEAD>In Waterville, the Maumee River Doesn't Flow Much These Days</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MITCH WEISS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WATERVILLE, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Maumee River is hardly flowing these
days in this town whose name conjures images of waterfalls and
flowing streams.
   ``It is amazing,'' said Walter Jones, 53, who has lived near
this village in northwest Ohio most of his life. ``I do not think I
have ever seen the river this dry. We have had some droughts, but
nothing like this.''
   The Maumee has been the lifeblood for many communities along its
banks. But this summer, levels in some stretches of the
drought-stricken river have dropped so low that communities have
implemented mandatory water use restrictions.
   Few villages have suffered as much as Waterville. The Ohio
Department of Natural Resources says the Maumee at Waterville is
flowing at 12 percent of its normal rate. Water use has been
restricted since Memorial Day.
   Two weeks ago, Waterville officials asked Grand Rapids, about 10
miles to the south, to open an old canal to release more water into
the Maumee.
   The state rejected the plan, saying the situation was not that
critical.
   However, Donald Holycross, Waterville's village administrator,
said Monday that the flow of water on the Maumee has increased _
though not enough _ over the last week.
   ``I still cannot tell you why,'' he said. ``I do not know
whether it was because of rainfall along the river.''
   The 80-mile-long Maumee originates in Fort Wayne, Ind., snakes
through several northwest Ohio counties and empties into Maumee Bay
on Lake Erie.
   Toledo, Ohio's fourth-largest city and on the banks of the
Maumee, hasn't suffered from the water shortage, since it draws all
its water from Lake Erie.
   The drought has affected other streams in rural northwest Ohio.
   The 120-mile-long Sandusky River, another Lake Erie tributary,
has more than its share of dry spots, and thousands of fish have
been killed near the Ballville Dam, Fremont's main reservoir, said
Rod Lash, the city's safety-service director.
   In Fremont, about 30 miles southeast of Toledo, officials have
reached an agreement with the Ohio Division of Water to release 10
million gallons daily for five days from a reservoir near Marion.
After that, the state will provide 5 million gallons a day from the
reservoir for as long as needed.
   Lash said it will take a week to 10 days for the water to make
the 100-mile trip north to Fremont.
   In Fostoria, which draws its water from the 50-mile-long Portage
River, voluntary water restrictions are in place. But that could
change, said J. Charles Macias, the city's safety-service director.
   The city's reservoirs, he said, have enough water to last for
several months, but is afraid the reserves could be depleted
quickly if the drought continues.
   Macias said scattered showers that fell over the region on
Sunday and Monday did little to alleviate the problem.
   ``We only got about four-tenths of an inch, not enough to pick
up any water at all. We would need two weeks of that kind of rain
to have the normal water flow in the river,'' he said.

   A rescue attempt failed to save a Boy Scout
and his scout master brother from a rain-swollen river in central
Texas, and raging flood waters swept four family members to their
deaths in a creekbed in the western part of the state.
   The body of Frank Tellez, 13, was found in the Guadalupe River
on Monday afternoon, and the body of his brother, 33-year-old
Richard Tellez was found today, officials said.
   The two were in a stalled pickup truck at a low-water crossing
with Dan Knight, director of the nearby Bear Creek Boy Scout camp,
authorities said. Knight said he managed to swim to safety after a
failed rescue effort.
   The river had risen 21 feet Monday near Hunt, about 50 miles
northwest of San Antonio, destroying piers and docks at summer
camps along its banks. The river began receding Monday afternoon.
   Four members of a San Jose, Calif., family drowned Sunday when
flood waters sent their station wagon down a creekbed in Pecos
County in western Texas, authorities said.
   A fifth family member, Cipriano Enriquez Rodriquez, 47, clung to
a tree overnight, then walked to a town about four miles away to
report the accident, said Sheriff Bruce Wilson.
   Killed were Rodriquez's wife, Maria Anna Ibarra Rodriquez, 55,
their son-in-law, Pedro Navarette Ruiz, 30; and two grandchildren,
Govanna Rodriquez, 12, and Pedro Rodriquez Jr., 7.
   In western Colorado, authorities today recovered the body of a
third boy who drowned Monday after they were swept into the
Gunnison River from a ledge at the base of a dam. A fourth boy, the
twin brother of one of the drowning victims, managed to reach
safety, officials said.
   The Mesa County Sheriff's Department said the boys were crossing
the base of Roller Dam about noon Monday when one of them slipped
and fell in. The others either jumped or slipped into the river
pool in an effort to help, officials said.
   In the central Texas drowning, Knight said he got out of the
truck when it stalled and went to a nearby home to get some rope
and inner tubes. But the rope was too short, he said.
   ``They were inside and they started to panic. I went up to the
truck to pull them out,'' Knight said. ``We were holding hands and
walking past the truck when a tree came up and hit us. We floated
about a half mile down to the bend and I was still holding to them.
A log hit my head and arm pretty hard and I had to let them go.''
   Evelyn Hickey, a witness, said the effort was heroic. She said
Knight risked his life trying to save them.
   ``He had made several attempts at the boy, but the other man
pulled them down. When he couldn't help them anymore, he got out a
long way downstream,'' Mrs. Hickey said.

   A general-alarm fire caused heavy damage
to a huge grocery distribution center, sending flames into the sky
early today that could be seen for miles.
   Firefighters contained the blaze, which began Monday night, but
said it could burn for hours and consume about a third of the
Safeway Stores building, which covers about 500,000 square feet.
   ``We are just trying to stop it before it destroys everything,''
said Police Sgt. Roy Howard, spokesman for the joint fire-police
department fighting the flames at the eight-building complex.
   The blaze and massive clouds of smoke could be seen across San
Francisco Bay in downtown San Francisco, about 15 miles to the
southwest.
   ``The big problems here are the size, the magnitude,'' Howard
said of the fire, punctuated by occasional explosions, in the
one-million-square-foot complex.
   No injuries were reported among the 600 workers who were at
their jobs when the blaze erupted about 10 p.m. in the wooden
structure, built about 35 years ago.
   ``It moved just way too fast to do anything about it,'' said
employee Chris Karajanis, 19, who was a few feet from where the
fire started in paper products stacked on pallets.
   He said a worker with a forklift tried to move the burning items
to isolate them but the flames burned so quickly the man gave up.
   ``First a number of us tried to put the fire out, but when we
saw there was no hope we evacuated the warehouse,'' said Dennis
Flores, a shipping foreman.
   Strong winds sent flaming debris flying for hundreds of feet in
several directions, setting fire to grass outside.
   Some 50 firefighters and 11 engines, the entire department in
this city of 100,000 people, responded, as well as fire units from
three nearby communities, Howard said.
   The warehouse supplies Safeway stores in Northern California and
parts of Nevada.

<HEAD>Pentagon May Name Admiral To Head Central Command</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Naval action in the Persian Gulf is helping
build sentiment in the Pentagon to appoint an admiral to head the
U.S. Central Command, headquarters for American forces in the
region, military sources said Tuesday.
   The Joint Chiefs of Staff were divided over who should head the
command, and the chairman, Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., sent the
names of an admiral and an Army general to Defense Secretary Frank
C. Carlucci.
   The Navy nominee to head the Central Command is Vice Adm. Henry
C. Mustin, the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Plans, Policy
and Operations, sources said. They identified the Army nominee as
Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations
and Plans.
   Carlucci is expected to make a decision well before the current
commander, Marine Gen. George B. Crist, steps aside this November,
said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Crist has
headed Central Command since 1985.
   Since the command was created in 1983, assuming most of the
functions of the Rapid Deployment Force, the top spot has been
rotated between the Army and the Marine Corps. But because the Navy
has dominated the action in the Persian Gulf, many in the Pentagon
believe the job should go to an admiral.
   The command has its headquarters at MacDill Air Force Base, in
Tampa, Fla., although it maintains virtually constant radio contact
with the overall commander of Naval forces in the gulf, Rear Adm.
Anthony Less, aboard his flagship, the USS Coronado.
   Sentiment to name an admiral to head the command arose before
the downing of an Iran Air jetliner with 290 people aboard on July
3, said the sources.
   Central Command is a unified joint command in which all Air
Force, Navy, Army and Marine Corps forces in a jurisdiction are
under the command of an officer chosen from one of the services.

   U.S. Ambassador Richard Melton met
today with embassy personnel after the Sandinista government
accused him and seven other American officials of inciting unrest
and ordered the diplomats to leave the country.
   President Reagan said today that in response to the expulsion
orders, he had ordered Nicaraguan Ambassador Carlos Tunnerman and
seven other Sandinista representatives to leave the United States.
   ``I have told the State Department to send their ambassador and
seven comrades back to Managua,'' Reagan told reporters in
Washington.
   U.S. officials said Melton was preparing to leave the country on
a special flight later in the day after meeting with embassy
personnel. It was not clear if the seven other American diplomats
would travel with him.
   An embassy source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
ambassador was meeting with embassy personnel.
   In Brussels, Belgium, Nicaragua's vice president today said no
additional diplomatic action was planned against the United States
to protest what he called U.S. efforts to destablize the country.
   ``We don't plan now to go beyond these measures,'' Sergio
Ramirez told reporters after meeting with officials of the European
Economic Community.
   Earlier today, the State Department called the expulsion of the
Americans ``an outrage and completely without justification.'' In
Manila, Secretary of State George P. Shultz also described
Nicaragua's expulsion order an ``absolute outrage'' and said
Washington would retaliate.
   Also on Monday, the Sandinistas shut down the country's Roman
Catholic radio station, arrested an opposition politician and
closed the lone opposition newspaper, La Prensa, for 15 days.
   The moves came a day after police used tear gas and beat
protesters in breaking up one of the largest anti-government
demonstrations since the Sandinistas came to power. An estimated
10,000 people took part.
   Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto said the U.S. diplomats, who
were ordered to leave within 72 hours, had engaged in ``activities
complementary to the state terrorism the administration of U.S.
President Ronald Reagan is carrying out against Nicaragua.''
   He said he summoned Melton to his office Monday to inform him of
the order.
   D'Escoto called Melton ``a robot of the maniacal (Assistant
Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs Elliott) Abrams'' at
a news conference.
   He said U.S. Embassy officials were at Sunday's rally in
Nandaime, about 40 miles south of Managua, at the Interior
Ministery said police arrested 42 people. The Sandinistas have
repeatedly accused U.S. diplomats of trying to destablize their
government by encouraging unrest.
   In a letter to Shultz, D'Escoto's identified the U.S. diplomats
ordered expelled with Melton as John E. Hope, first secretary in
charge of economic and commercial affairs; Hugh V. Simon Jr., first
secretary; Delvin Junker and David Nolan, both second secretaries;
John S. Creamer and Aubrey A. Carlson, third secretaries and vice
consuls; and Robert Bruce Murray, an assistant attache.
   Melton, 52, arrived as ambassador in May, filling the post left
vacant since July 1987.
   ``This man has violated all acceptable standards of behavior,''
D'Escoto said. ``I told him that here you cannot come give orders
like a proconsul in Honduras and that this country is sovereign and
independent.''
   On June 6, 1983, the government expelled three U.S. diplomats
accused of taking part in an alleged plot to poison D'Escoto. The
United States responded by closing several Nicaraguan consulates in
the United States.
   In closing Radio Catolica, the Interior Ministry accused the
station of ``inciting to violence, disorder and lack of respect for
constitutional government'' in reporting about Sunday's
demonstration.
   In compliance with a regional peace plan, both the station and
La Prensa were allowed to reopen in October after being shut down
for more than a year.
   An official in the Interior Ministry press office, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said police on Monday arrested Miriam
Arguello, secretary-general of the opposition Conservative Party
for ``being the principal instigator'' of Sunday's rally.
   Witnesses said police started Sunday's fracas by pushing at the
back of the crowd. They said the crowd threw stones in response to
police tear gas. Ten police officers were injured, the official
Voice of Nicaragua said. It did not say how many protesters were
hurt.
   The Sandinistas came to power in 1979 after a civil war toppled
the rightist government of Anastasio Somoza.
   The U.S.-backed rebels known as Contras have been fighting the
government for nearly seven years. They signed a preliminary peace
accord March 23 and a tenuous cease-fire remains in effect.
   In February, Congress turned down Reagan's request for renewed
military aid to the Contras.

   The Lake Geneva Rotary Club's Farm
Drought Relief Fund got its first contribution from an unlikely
source _ the Grateful Dead.
   On June 29, Mayor Spyro Condos sent a bill for $1,200 to Alpine
Valley Music Theatre. Condos said so many people _ 60,000 _ had
been drawn to the area for Grateful Dead concerts last month that
Lake Geneva had had to hire extra police to help control crowds.
   In response, Condos said Monday, the band sent the city $2,000,
including $500 for the police department reserve fund and $1,500
for the fund to help farmers get livestock feed.
   Condos presented the $1,500 to Rotary officials Monday night,
during the club's benefit concert by Woody Herman's Young
Thundering Herd. Dave Tasse of the Rotary Club said Tuesday that
exact figures were not available yet, but that the benefit
attracted several hundred people and raised several thousand
dollars for the fund.
   The $15-a-ticket concert marked the club's first benefit to earn
money for the fund, said Rotary spokesman Daniel Curran.

crimes from drug dealing to manslaughter.
   Today, they stand at attention, heads shaved, eyes straight
ahead. Every phrase ends with an emphatic ``Sir!'' Every item in
their foot lockers perfectly folded, every order perfectly obeyed.
   No, they haven't joined the military. Not exactly.
   They're probationers at Camp Sauble, Michigan's 5-month-old
experimental ``boot camp'' prison, where ``shock incarceration'' is
used to jolt 17- to 25-year-old offenders into straightening out
their lives.
   On Monday, reporters got their first glimpse of the intense
physical training and military-style discipline the probationers
endure for 90 days.
   From the first day, the offender is ``told he's an embarrassment
to society, ... a parasite to society,'' said Inspector Bruce L.
Curtis, an ex-Marine drill instructor.
   ``We start working on their minds,'' Curtis said. ``It's the
first time they've ever been held accountable for anything. Instead
of holding down a job or going to school, it's been easier for them
to knock some old lady on the street and take her Social Security
check.''
   At first, 19-year-old Jesse Roberson of Pontiac didn't think he
could make it through the program.
   ``When I first came here I was pretty scared,'' said Roberson,
who was driving drunk when a passenger in his car was killed in a
crash. He faced 15 to 30 years in prison for manslaughter.
   Roberson's now looking at graduation in two weeks.
   ``You come in a baby and you leave a man,'' he said. ``This
program got rid of my temper and makes me want to go out and do
something positive with my life.''
   Scott Fetzlaff, 20, of Manistee, said he's had time to think
about his mistakes, including his breaking and entering conviction.
   ``They scare everything right out of you the first day,'' he
said. ``It's going to change my ways when I get out.''
   The program, which began March 1 at a former minimum-security
work camp in the Manistee National Forest, has had seven graduates
and now has 70 probationers, about half its capacity. Two men
escaped, only to be captured within 24 hours, and 16 others have
flunked out, returning to the judge for resentencing, usually
resulting in a multiyear prison term.
   Those who disobey orders may be required to carry a 25-pound
``motivational'' log on their shoulder for the day, or to perform
``motivational'' detail, possibly digging out a tree stump by hand.
   For the probationers, days begin at 5 a.m. with the screams of a
corrections officer or the banging of trash can lids at their
heads. Physical training, cleaning buildings and 7{ hours of
chopping trees in county, state and federal parks make up most of
the 17-hour days, followed by educational and substance abuse
programs at night.
   One hour of free time may be spent watching television news or
writing letters. No visits are allowed, and one 10-minute telephone
call may be made each week after the first six weeks.
   The men march double time, chanting in unison after the officer
in charge, ``Mental tough, mental hard! I can do it! You can do it!
We can do it!''
   A shifting eye while standing at attention may result in 15
push-ups on the spot. There is silence at meal time.
   The program is modeled after similar programs in other parts of
the country, but is designed for more ``hard-core'' offenders than
the others, said Donald Hengesh, state Department of Corrections
project coordinator.
   While offenders must not have served any previous prison
sentence, their convictions range from felonious assault and
manslaughter to forgery and narcotics possession.
   ``There are no Sunday school cases here,'' said Hengesh.
   The Department of Corrections has notified judges and probation
officers that the program is an option for offenders who, according
to sentencing guidelines, would face at least one year of prison.
The only exception would be a probation violator with a new felony
conviction, who might be sentenced to a prison term of less than 12
months.
   Candidates must never have served any prison time and must be
physically able to participate. Offenders convicted of sex or arson
charges also are not admitted.
   The program is proving cost effective, with each inmate costing
$3,846, compared with $20,000 each state prison inmate costs
annually, Hengesh said.
   While civil rights activists argue intimidation and fear don't
rehabilitate, state Sen. Jack Welborn, who sponsored legislation to
fund the camp, said he's sold on the program.
   ``I believe a kid in this program has a better chance of going
straight when he gets out than in any other program in the
corrections system,'' he said. ``The kid that goes into prison
comes out a better criminal.''

<HEAD>Ragtime The Miniature Horse Gets To Stay At Home, Court Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appellate panel has ruled that
Ragtime, a 29-inch high miniature horse, can live in a woman's
house and back yard, but neighbors and the city threaten a civil
suit.
   The panel of two Ventura County Superior Court judges upheld
Municipal Court Judge Herber Curtis' September 1987 decision that
Patty Fairchild could keep Ragtime on her property. Thousand Oaks
appealed that ruling.
   Curtis ruled that a city law prohibiting the keeping of two
horses on less than 20,000 square feet of property did not clearly
apply to one horse.
   ``It brought tears to my eyes,'' Mrs. Fairchild said Monday
after she learned of the decision by Melinda Johnson and Bruce
Thompson. The ruling was endorsed by Superior Court Judge Kenneth
Yegan.
   The city has since revised its ordinance, but Mrs. Fairchild
will not be re-cited, said Assistant City Attorney Shawn Mason. He
said officials will rely on a suit by the city or one brought by
the Oakbrook Homeowners Association to obtain a favorable court
ruling. The homeowners group claims the horse creates an offensive
stench and violates city rules.
   Ragtime, a 2-year-old American miniature horse, spends most of
his time outdoors at the 6,000-square-foot Fairchild home, but
occasionally goes inside to eat or sit on the family couch.

<HEAD>Democrats Release Proposed Platform Without Jackson Planks</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Political Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Democratic platform committee today
released its proposed platform without the minority planks sought
by Jesse Jackson's campaign.
   The nine-page document would be the shortest party platform in
half a century if approved next Tuesday at the national convention
in Atlanta.
   Eleanor Holmes Norton, Jackson's chief platform negotiator, said
in an interview that the minority planks were left out because
``we're still negotiating.'' She added that talks with Michael
Dukakis campaign ``are going well.''
   The 4,000-plus-word document includes all the areas of agreement
reached June 25 in a meeting of the 186-member platform committee
in Denver.
   The Jackson forces lost votes there on such issues as his call
for higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations, a Pentagon
freeze, no first-use of nuclear weapons, self-determination for the
Palestinians and major increases in spending on Head Start,
education and other social programs.
   The platform released today includes a memorandum that says,
``To avoid delay in printing the platform, all parties have agreed
that the report on minority planks, which is still under
discussion, will be available at the convention.''
   The platform promises to ``reverse seven years of `voodoo
economics,' `trickle down' policies, fiscal irresponsibility and
economic violence against poor and working people.''
   It pledges the party to seek an indexed minimum wage, ``major
increases'' in child care aid for low and middle-income families,
advance notice of plant closings and appointment of a national drug
czar. It also endorses the Equal Rights Amendment and says ``the
fundamental right of reproductive choice should be guaranteed
regardless of ability to pay.''
   It promises the Democrats will fight homelessness and intensify
the war on AIDS, and it says national strength ``will be enhanced
by more stable defense budgets.''
   ``We believe in an America, neither gun-shy nor trigger-happy,
that will promote peace and prevent war,'' it says.

<HEAD>Carlucci Says Defense Contractors May Be Suspended As Result of
Probe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci said Tuesday
he has warned defense contractors that their weapons programs may
yet be suspended if they are tainted by the developing Pentagon
bribery investigation.
   Carlucci, testifying to the Senate Armed Services Committee,
noted he had lifted a July 1 suspension of contracts for nine
military programs because a review had found none were adversely
affected by the case.
   ``But in doing so, we have sent out a warning that says this
does not mean if there is further information that comes to light,
that we will not once against review this contract and take
appropriate action,'' he said.
   The investigation involves allegations that defense contractors
and consultants bribed Pentagon officials for details that could
have been vital in bidding for contracts worth billions of dollars.
No charges have yet been filed.
   Carlucci told the Senate panel he is writing to the chief
executives of the top 200 defense contractors, ``urging them to
ensure stringent management controls on the use of consultants and
to avoid improper business practices.''
   ``My job is not to punish companies, my job is to protect the
national security,'' said Carlucci, noting that it is up to the
Justice Department to prosecute alleged crimes.
   But he outlined a number of actions the Pentagon can take,
including rescinding, terminating or suspending contracts, or
fining individuals.
   Carlucci admitted that there are problems in the procurement
process. ``There are defects in how America equips its forces,'' he
said.
   The current investigation is a good reason to correct those
flaws, he said. ``Even if the probe reveals no more than the
misdeeds of a few greedy lawbreakers, I still want to move forward
now, in cooperation with Congress, to remedy flaws in our system,
regardless of whether those flaws are related to the Justice
investigation.''
   Carlucci noted that he has appointed a task force to propose
changes and he appealed to Congress not to usurp that panel's role.
   ``Hasty or piecemeal reforms ... could do more harm than good,''
he said.
   He also urged that the administration be given credit for past
changes.
   ``Our nation has in this decade markedly improved its defense
acquisition system. The Justice Department probe should in no way
tarnish the progress the Defense Department and Congress have
made.''
   ``Some of the wrongdoing being uncovered may simply be
violations of the law, not system deficiencies,'' he said. ``Some
system flaws highlighted by the probe may be ones that our
government has not really tackled, such as budget instability and
political intervention points.''
   ``Some uncovered flaws perhaps were ... unavoidable,
consequences of past reforms. For example, one of the most complex
issues we face is the impact of increased competition for
contracts. High-stakes competition may cause difficult problems
that are just now surfacing,'' Carlucci said.
   He also said one major problem in the process is ``what I would
term `intervention points' - opportunities for friendships or
political clout to carry more weight than contractor performance or
product quality and cost.''
   ``We can reduce these opportunities for intervention through
such techniques as long-term contracts, simplifying specifications,
freezing weapons designs, contracting to performance, and multiyear
approvals of programs,'' he said.
   Carlucci opposed suggestions that an all-civilian force should
be created to buy weapons.
   ``A remedy for procurement difficulties is not to exclude from
the process the military professionals who will use the defense
systems we buy,'' he said. ``Our military people have a vital
interest in the quality of those systems and in how efficiently we
buy them. We must retain user involvement in defense acquisition.
That means the military services must continue to play a major
role.''

   An inquiry into the reasons that a jetliner lost
part of its roof will focus on quality assurance, the design and
certification of airplane bodies, and human and other factors in
maintenance, the chairman of a fact-finding board said today.
   The National Transportation Safety Board wants to supplement
facts gathered after 18 feet of an Aloha Airlines jet's roof peeled
back on April 28, said John K. Lauber of the National
Transportation Safety Board as a four-day hearing began.
   Lauber cautioned that five-person NTSB hearing board is not
designed to determine who was at fault or who was liable for the
Boeing 737's accident.
   Officials have said the hearing will also look into the
maintenance and usable life of aging jetliners in general.
   The first witnesses scheduled to testify were from Aloha
Airlines and included the company's vice president of operations,
Thomas Derieg.
   In announcing the hearings, Lauber said an NTSB report on the
accident wouldn't be released for months but added that ``safety
recommendations to prevent a recurrence of such an accident could
be made at any time.''
   A flight attendant was swept to her death and 61 of the 94 other
people aboard Aloha Flight 243 were hurt when the cabin top peeled
away on a flight from Hilo to Honolulu, exposing the first-class
section to the open air at 24,000 feet.
   The pilot and co-pilot managed to land the crippled jet 13
minutes later in Maui although one of the two engines quit.
Aviation experts said they were amazed the aircraft could land at
all.
   The damaged plane and two other Aloha 737-200s, both later
grounded, had the highest number of landings of any Boeing
commercial jets, officials of the aircraft manufacturer said after
the accident. The damaged plane was built in 1969 and had 89,680
landings.
   The accident prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to
order inspections and repairs of older, high-cycle 737s.
   Those expected to testify included representatives of the
Federal Aviation Administration, Boeing Co., Aloha, Air
Transportation Association and British Civil Aviation Authority,
plus experts from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and State
University of New York, said Benson.

   President Reagan today pledged to fight for a
proposed sale of Maverick missiles to Kuwait and said he believes
there is a chance of success.
   Posing for photographers as he prepared to meet with Crown
Prince and Prime Minister Sheik Saad Al-Abudllah Al-Sabah, Reagan
told reporters:
   ``You bet we're going to fight for it. We want very much to
complete that.''
   Asked if there was any chance of success, he replied, ``I think
so.''
   In his formal speech at a departure ceremony after their private
meeting, the president said, ``We strongly support the request for
F-18 aircraft and accompanying weapons now pending before
Congress.''
   The Senate voted last week to bar any sale of Mavericks, one of
the missile systems involved in the sale, to the Kuwaitis. This
vote is subject to action by the House and a conference committee
of the two houses.
   The Kuwaiti leader, in his response, thanked Reagan for U.S.
support and said, ``We have followed with great interest your
efforts toward peace in the Middle East and hope such efforts will
continue.''

<HEAD>Minister Charged With Killing Woman Same Day He Preached Sermon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VICKSBURG, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A minister who led officers to the
shallow grave of a woman he allegedly shot on a Sunday before
preaching a sermon has been charged with murder, authorities said.
   The body of Lula Sims, 24, was found Monday night in woods 40
miles from Vicksburg, Warren County Sheriff Paul Barrett said. Her
family had reported her missing on July 3.
   The Rev. Jonathan Hamlin, 24, was charged with murder after he
showed up at the sheriff's office with his attorneys Monday
afternoon, Barrett said.
   ``We started talking then and by 6 p.m. he said he would take me
to the body,'' Barrett said. ``He said he knew where it was, but he
never did say that he killed her. At that point I charged him with
murder.''
   Barrett said an investigation showed Hamlin shot the woman at
her Vicksburg home early on July 3.
   Barrett said he believed the shooting occurred during an
argument and that Hamlin ``disposed of her body and then returned
to Vicksburg to preach at Sunday morning worship services.''
   Chief Deputy Otho Jones said Hamlin, married and a father of
three, became a suspect early last week when authorities learned he
was in a relationship with Sims, a divorced mother of three.
   Hamlin is pastor of Cool Spring Missionary Baptist Church and
Zion Traveler Church in Vicksburg.
   Barrett said Hamlin's case would likely go to a grand jury in
the fall. He is being held without bond in the Warren County Jail,
and no hearing has been scheduled for him to enter a plea.
   The sheriff said authorities had recovered a .22 caliber,
pearl-handled revolver believed used in the shooting.
   An autopsy has been ordered.

   Orange flames lit the night sky of Soviet Central
Asia Tuesday as the Soviet Union launched the second of a pair of
space probes on an 111 million-mile odyssey to explore the
mysteries of Mars and help prepare for a manned flight to the red
planet.
   Soviet television showed a recording of the 9:01 p.m. Moscow
time (1:01 p.m. EDT) launch of Phobos II during its evening news
broadcast. Last week's launch of the Phobos I was televised live,
but at the time of Tuesday launch, state-run television was showing
coverage of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's visit to Poland.
   A Soviet-made Proton booster rocket roared to life and carried
the solar-panel powered probe off the launchpad at the Baikonur
Cosmodrome on the steppes of Central Asia.
   Its companion, Phobos I, was launched skyward atop a
200-foot-high Proton booster rocket from Baikonur on Thursday, and
Soviet media said its on-board navigation systems were switched on
the next day.
   More than a dozen nations, including the United States, are
participating in the international mission to swoop close to the
surface of Mars' moon, Phobos, and drop instruments onto the
satellite that scientists say may provide clues to how the universe
was formed.
   NASA's Deep Space Network will provide radio tracking data so
the probes can locate the moon, which is only about 17 miles
across. If Phobos is an asteroid trapped by Mars' gravity, as many
scientists believe, the probes will be able to study matter that is
little changed since the infancy of the solar system billions of
years ago.
   If all goes well, the two Soviet spacecraft will enter the
gravitational pull of Mars in January and fall into orbit just
behind Phobos for a three-month remote study of the Martian
surface, atmosphere and magnetic field. Next to Venus, Mars is the
heavenly body believed to most resemble the Earth.
   In April, the two craft will drop out of their orbit and swoop
to within 100 feet of Phobos' surface, where they will release two
100-pound landers.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said that in one experiment, a laser
beam carried by a lander will used to split off a tiny piece of
Phobos' rocky surface and trap it for close examination.
   One of the landers is expected to operate for about a year in a
stationary position, sending back data to arth. Another is
scheduled to bound like a kangaroo about the little moon in 65-foot
leaps, gathering and analyzing soil samples.
   Soviet scientists say the Phobos mission is an important step
toward a manned flight to Mars, which they hope will be possible
early in the 21st century.
   Soviet officials have put the cost of the Phobos mission at $480
million.

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis' choice of Texas Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen to be his running mate drew praise from fellow Democrats
today, with several of them likening it to another
Massachusetts-Texas ticket _ John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson
in 1960.
   ``The Massachusetts-Texas combination got this country moving
again in 1960 _ and it will do the same for the nation in 1988,''
said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., younger brother of the late
president.
   Dukakis and Bentsen both were quick to draw the comparison
between this campaign and the one 28 years ago.
   ``The Massachusetts and the Texas ex'es were good for the
country and good for the Democratic Party in 1960 and it's going to
be a real winner in November of 88,'' Bentsen said today.
   ``Selecting a running mate is probably the first presidential
act _ if I can use that word _ that I will do,'' Dukakis said in
introducing his running mate. ``Lloyd Bentsen brings to this ticket
and will bring to this nation years of experience.''
   Bentsen's ``selection gives the Democratic Party a strong ticket
for November _ and even more important, the strong prospect of
eight solid years of effective new leadership for America,''
Kennedy said.
   Texas State Treasurer Ann Richards, who will be the keynote
speaker at next week's Democratic convention in Atlanta, called
Bentsen ``a level guy'' who ``will make a great vice president''
and added:
   ``There's always been a sort of Austin-to-Boston, Mass.,
connection, and I think that this ticket adds that same sort of
magic.''
   Ms. Richards also said that Bentsen would boost Democrats'
chances in Texas, one of the states that Dukakis' likely Republican
opponent, George Bush, calls home.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., whose own hopes for the presidential
nomination were dashed earlier this year, agreed that Bentsen could
help the Democratic ticket in Texas and said he thought the Texas
senator might help the Democrats carry Oklahoma and Louisiana as
well.
   ``Lloyd Bentsen is a skilled and seasoned lawmaker,'' Simon
said. ``This is an excellent choice, and this is a winning ticket.
   ``Democratic prospects in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana will be
boosted immediately and, when the American people get to know Lloyd
Bentsen, it will strengthen the ticket everywhere,'' Simon added.
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, who will deliver the nominating
speech for Dukakis, said he also believed that Bentsen would help
the Democrats carry Texas and would help the party across the
region.
   ``I like and respect him very much,'' Clinton said.
   Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., said she believes ``Lloyd Bentsen
will be a fine addition to the Democratic ticket. He knows his
issues and he knows his politics. Best of all,'' she said, ``he
knows how to beat George Bush. He did just that in 1970 to become
U.S. senator.''
   In Florida, where Democrats had been pushing home state Sen. Bob
Graham for the No. 2 spot on the Dukakis ticket, state Rep. Mike
Abrams also offered praise for Bentsen and said a Dukakis-Bentsen
victory in his state is ``doable.''
   ``We all know it's going to be tough,'' said Abrams, who is
coordinator of the Dukakis campaign in Florida. But, he added, the
choice of Bentsen ``shows a sensitivity to the South'' and ``brings
defense and foreign policy and Washington experience,'' all
considered crucial to a Democratic victory in Florida.
   Even backers of Jesse Jackson, who came in second to Dukakis in
the race for the presidential nomination and who had been one of
those the Massachusetts governor had considered for the second
spot, seemed satisfied with Bentsen.
   Florida state Rep. James Burke, who was the state campaign
coordinator for Jackson, said, ``We would have preferred to have
had Jesse.'' He added, though, that ``Bentsen is a better choice
than some of the others he could have picked.''
   John White, a former Democratic national chairman who has been
advising Jackson, said he was ``excited'' about the choice of
Bentsen and said it would ``make Texas a hell of a battlefield.''
   Union activists also praised Bentsen, saying that the Texas
senator had recently shored up his poor record on labor issues with
his deft handling of the trade bill and mandatory plant closing and
layoff notices _ some of labor's top legislative priorities this
year.
   ``Bentsen was extremely helpful in recognizing that the two _
plant closing notices and the trade bill _ were compatible,'' said
Robert McGlotten, legislative director for the AFL-CIO. ``And he
let his colleagues know how he felt.''
   Geraldine Ferraro, who four years ago was picked as Democrat
Walter Mondale's running mate, said she was ``delighted'' at the
choice of Bentsen.
   ``I think it's an indication that Governor Dukakis intends to
run a strong national campaign,'' Ms. Ferraro said.
   On the Republican side, Senate Minority leader Bob Dole of
Kansas, frequently mentioned as a possible vice president on Bush's
ticket, said he thought Dukakis ``couldn't have picked a better
man.''
   Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., who is national co-chairwoman of
Bush's presidential campaign, called Bentsen ``a nice man who's
able'' but said she still anticipated that Bush would be able to
carry Texas.
   On the similarity to the Kennedy-Johnson ticket of 1960, she
said: ``I'm sure we're going to hear 1960 ad nauseum. There's a
slight difference of course. He (Bentsen) was not selected by his
peers to be in leadership (as Lyndon Johnson, the Senate majority
leader, had been); nor is Dukakis John Kennedy.''

   Ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle has slipped
out of his Panamanian hiding place and was in Miami on Tuesday for
a routine heart checkup, that nation's ambassador to the United
States said.
   ``But he is definitely going pack to Panama,'' said Ambassador
Juan Sosa in Washington. ``He has a commitment to return Panama to
democracy.''
   The U.S. government still recognizes Delvalle as his nation's
chief of state despite his February overthrow by Panama's military
ruler Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Delvalle has been in hiding in Panama with the help of the
United States since Noriega preplaced him with Manuel Solis Palma.
   Delvalle had heart bypass surgery about 10 years ago and is
supposed to have a checkup every six months, said Sosa. He said the
president is not hospitalized, and is being tested by his private
physician.
   ``He's fine,'' Sosa said.
   The ambassador said Delvalle had no plans to go to Washington to
meet with U.S. officials, but did not rule it out.
   ``He will decide that after he finishes his checkups,'' said
Sosa.
   Delvalle arrived here secretly Sunday, according to Panama's
Miami Consul Roberto Dominguez.
   He was expected to return home in a few days. For security
reasons, the officials would not say how or when Delvalle was
traveling.
   After Noriega was indicted in Florida on charges of drug
trafficking, Delvalle tried to fire him as head of the country's
military.
   But Noriega refused to go, and instead had Delvalle replaced.
Delvalle has continued to issue anti-Noriega statements from his
hiding place in Panama.
   After Delvalle's mother died in Miami last week and her body was
flown to Panama, Solis Palma offered to allow him to attend the
funeral, but the president did not show up at services.

   Career diplomat Richard Melton served only two
months as ambassador to Nicaragua before the Sandinista government
ordered him out of the country on grounds of interfering in
Nicaragua's internal affairs.
   Melton, 52, is one of the State Department's most experienced
Central America experts and is considered close to Assistant
Secretary of State Elliott Abrams. He is known around the State
Department for his low-key style.
   Before his appointment to Managua, Melton served as director of
the State Department's office of Central American affairs.
   In early 1987, he took an interim assignment as head of the U.S.
Embassy in Costa Rica after Ambassador Lewis Tambs resigned and
returned to private life.
   Melton arrived in Managua on April 12, a period of high hopes
because of a temporary cease-fire signed three weeks earlier by the
Sandinistas and the Contra rebels. He presented his credentials to
President Daniel Ortega in May.
   Melton is a 27-year veteran of the foreign service. His first
foreign assignment was as political officer in Managua in 1963
during the rule of the Somoza family dynasty. He speaks Spanish and
Portuguese.

   Associated Press Writer=
   BOSTON (AP) _ Democrat Michael Dukakis today named Texas Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen as his vice presidential running mate for the fall
campaign. ``We go to Atlanta and begin the road to victory,''
Dukakis said.
   Dukakis likened himself to John F. Kennedy, who won the White
House for the Democrats in 1960 with Texan Lyndon Johnson on the
ticket.
   And like 1960, when Republicans nominated an incumbent vice
president and were defeated, Dukakis said, ``Jack Kennedy and
Lyndon Johnson beat that incumbent Republican vice president in
1960 and Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen are going to beat them
in 1988.''
   He said Bentsen brought to the Democratic ticket ``years of
experience and a deep commitment to civil rights ... that goes way
back to the 1940s.'' Dukakis said Bentsen stood for good jobs at
good wages _ a central theme of his campaign.
   Bentsen, who received a standing ovation from the crowd, spoke
with force and emotion rarely seen from Dukakis himself.
   ``The fact that he's chosen a senator from Texas, a senator from
the South, shows that we're going to fight for every state in the
Union and we're going all out to win,'' Bentsen said.
   Bentsen said Dukakis, a son of Greek immigrants, was ``living
out his parents' dream but wants that dream a reality for all
Americans.''
   Dukakis lavishly praised Bentsen for his work in Congress.
   ``He has hit a grand slam homerun because as chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee he has personally and successfully led the
fight for welfare reform, for catastrophic health insurance,'' he
said.
   Dukakis praised his work on a trade bill and a plant closing law
that will give workers ``at least 60 days notice before they're
thrown out in the street''
   ``If Edwin Meese can give himself 30 days notice then the least
we can do is give honest hardworking workers 60 days notice before
we lay them off,'' he said.
   The political marriage was announced in a sweltering Faneuil
Hall in Boston, with political luminaries in the audience and a
large crowd of supporters standing outside.
   Dukakis and Benstsen were joined by their wives, Kitty Dukakis
and Beryl Ann Bentsen. The hall was festooned with signs
proclaiming ``Dukakis-Bentsen '88.'' Campaign staffers threw
baseball caps reading ``Don't Mess with Texas'' to the cheering
crowd.
   Dukakis was introduced by another Bostonian, Democratic Party
chairman Paul Kirk, who also recalled Kennedy's selection of
Johnson as running mate in 1960. ``We see history repeating itseelf
today and we'll see it repeated in November in 1988,'' he said.
   With his choice, Dukakis signaled a determination to challenge
the Republican Party's Electoral College stronghold in the South
and especially in Bush's presumed strongest state. Texas is his
adopted home state.
   Texas has 29 electoral votes, more than any state except
California and New York, and some Dukakis aides have said they hope
selecting a Southerner would at least force the expected Republican
candidate to spend more time defending the region than he would
want.
   In 1970, Bentsen defeated George Bush in a run for the Senate
from Texas. Bush, now the Republican presidential
nominee-in-waiting, said recently, ``(Bentsen) doesn't worry me,''
adding, ``We can carry the state'' even if Bentsen is on the
Democratic ticket.
   Bentsen, 67, is little known outside of Texas. In a national
Gallup poll in mid-May, 77 percent of the people surveyed said they
did not know enough about Bentsen to say what they thought of him.
Of the few who had an opinion, 3 percent said they had a very
favorable view of Bentsen, 12 percent mostly favorable, 6 percent
mostly unfavorable and 2 percent very unfavorable.
   Bentsen, an elegantly tailored, silver-haired patrician, is the
scion of a wealthy landed family from the Rio Grande Valley _ and a
card-carrying member of the Senate Democratic establishment. He is
a former chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Committee, a
position that requires fund-raising to elect Democrats to the
Senate, and has been chairman of the Senate Finance Committee since
Democrats gained control of the Senate 18 months ago.
   On at least one key issue, Bentsen has parted company with
Dukakis, voting for aid to the Contra rebels fighting the
Nicaraguan government. Dukakis frequently has denounce the Reagan
administration support for the Contras a ``failed and illegal
policy.''
   Bentsen, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, campaigned
with Dukakis in Texas last Friday and downplayed talk he would be
chosen for the vice presidential nomination, telling reporters: ``I
don't think you have to worry about that.''
   At the time, Dukakis said of Bentsen: ``He could make a great
contribution to this country in many, many ways. He already has.''
   Bentsen as well gave no hint, either in words or body language,
that he felt close to the selection.
   Bentsen is up for re-election to his Senate seat in November,
and if he chooses, could run for both offices at once _ a precedent
set by Johnson in 1960.
   Bentsen will be nominated at the Democratic convention in
Atlanta on July 21, the fourth and final night of the party
gathering. Convention delegates must ratify Dukakis' choice.
   Bentsen was chosen over six others who were being considered by
Dukakis: Jesse Jackson, Sens. John Glenn of Ohio, Albert Gore Jr.
of Tennessee and Bob Graham of Florida and Reps. Richard Gephardt
of Missouri and Lee Hamilton of Indiana.
   Bentsen's selection closes weeks of speculation on who Dukakis
would choose to round out his ticket. Jackson had raised the stakes
on Monday by saying he would accept if asked. Jackson's reaction to
the selection of Bentsen could be crucial to convention harmony and
Democratic hopes of a victory in November.
   While the Massachusetts governor has an unquestioned majority in
the convention hall, Jackson's response to being passed over may
provide the first signal of how hard he will work for the ticket in
the fall campaign.
   In Washington, Jackson was asked if Dukakis had informed him of
a decision. ``No,'' he said.
   Bentsen, a millionaire businessman, has been a central player in
Congress' battle with President Reagan over trade legislation _ an
issue Democrats plan to play heavily in this fall's campaign. His
committee also oversees tax legislation and the welfare reform bill
currently before a House-Senate conference committee.
   Bentsen mounted a 1976 run for the Democratic presidential
nomination but excited little interest. In 1984, he was on
Democratic nominee Walter Mondale's list of possible running mates
_ the only white male interviewed by Mondale in a field that
included former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein and eventual
pick Geraldine Ferraro.
   On the negative side, Bentsen created a brief furor in February
1987 when it was revealed that he had asked lobbyists to pay
$10,000 apiece to join him for breakfast once a month.
   The breakfast club, called the ``Chairman's Council,'' held one
meeting and was quickly disbanded with Bentsen promising to return
the money collected from an estimated 40 lobbyists.

   Michael Dukakis today chose Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as his Democratic
running mate, duplicating a Massachusetts-Texas ticket that won the
White House for John Kennedy in 1960. ``We're going to fight for
every state in the Union and we're going all out to win,'' Bentsen
told a boisterous Boston campaign rally.
   In their joint appearance at historic Fanueil Hall, the
Massachusetts governor cited the parallels to 1960 as well as
Bentsen's strengths.
   ``Lloyd Bentsen brings to this ticket and to this nation, years
of experience, a deep committment to civil rights and equality of
opportunity that goes way back to the 1940s,'' Dukakis said.
   ``The Republicans in 1988 are about to do what they in 1960,
when they nominated an incumbent vice president,'' the Democratic
presidential nominee-in-waiting said. ``Jack Kennedy and Lyndon
Johnson beat that incumbent vice president president in 1960 and
Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen are going to beat them in 1988.
   Early this morning, Dukakis began to call the other Democrats
who had made it onto his short list of possible running mates to
tell them of the decision. But Jesse Jackson, who flew from
Cincinnati to Washington early today, apparently did not get a call
before the choice became known.
   A curt ``no'' was Jackson's reponse to a reporter's question in
Washington on whether he had talked with Dukakis. Jackson would
only say ``no comment'' on the choice of Bentsen as he headed for
private meetings with supporters.
   He and Bentsen passed through the same Washington airport
terminal within minutes of each other today without meeting, as
Bentsen headed to Boston with top Dukakis aide Paul Brountas.
   In Boston, Dukakis praised Bentsen for his work in Congress,
saying, ``He has hit a grand slam homerun because as chairman of
the Senate Finance Committee. He has personally and successfully
led the fight for welfare reform, for catastrophic health
insurance,'' as well as work on a trade bill and a plant-closing
legislation.
   Bentsen, 67, said his choice is a clear signal for the fall
campaign.
   ``The fact that he's taken a senator from Texas, a senator from
the South shows that we're going to fight for every state in the
union and we're going all out to win,'' Bentsen said.
   Even as Democrats braced for reaction from party liberal
activists and Jesse Jackson supporters, some Republicans were hard
put to criticize the choice. Senate GOP leader Bob Dole, frequently
mentioned as a possible vice president on George Bush's ticket,
said Dukakis ``couldn't have picked a better man.''
   Former Democratic National Committee Chairman John White, a
Jackson supporter from Texas, said Bentsen has ``one of the best
civil rights records in the Senate. He voted against the poll tax
when he was in the Congress back in the 50s .... He's not a
newcomer.''
   Dukakis' choice sets up a home-state showdown with the
Republicans for the big prize of 29 electoral votes, since Vice
President Bush, the GOP's presidential nominee-to-be, claims Texas
as his voting residence.
   ``It makes Texas a battleground,'' said Republican strategist
Vince Breglio.
   ``The Massachusetts-Texas combination got this country moving
again in 1960 _ and it will do the same for the nation in 1988,''
said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, whose brother tapped Lyndon Johnson in
1960 _ a reluctant decision that was instrumental in Kennedy
winning a close election.
   Bush said in an interview published today that the selection of
Bentsen won't change his claim to Texas.
   Bentsen ``doesn't worry me,'' Bush told the Boston Globe before
Bentsen's selection. ``We can carry the state.''
   Bush has lost to Bentsen once already. They squared off in a
1970 race which propelled Bentsen to the Senate for the first of
his three terms.
   Dukakis chose Bentsen at a late Monday night meeting with top
aides Brountas and Susan Estrich, just hours after Jesse Jackson
for the first time declared his hopes for the vice presidential
nomination.
   The next 24 hours will provide a highly visible stage for
Jackson to give his response to the Bentsen choice and for Dukakis
to appeal to Jackson's supporters for the unity he needs for a
peaceful convention in Atlanta next week.
   Jackson speaks to the annual convention of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People tonight,
following a Bush speech there earlier. On Wednesday, Dukakis and
Bentsen will appear at the NAACP meeting.
   Bush promised the NAACP that he would fight for civil rights as
president, whether or not he receives strong black support in the
fall and he praised Jackson.
   ``And I don't have to cover up the differences _ I have profound
differences with Jesse on many of these issues, but I salute him
for running the race, for being heard, and he deserves a salute
from us,'' Bush said, again drawing loud applause from the audience.
   And the reaction of other liberal Democrats to the selection of
the conservative Texan was certain to spark interest in Atlanta.
   ``Wild, absolutely wild,'' said one liberal party official of
the choice. ``I have no idea what his civil rights record is.''
   Some Jackson supporters have talked of entering his name in
nomination for vice president as a challenge to Dukakis, although
Jackson has not spoken publicly on the subject.
   Bentsen is little known outside of his home state, polls
suggest. A Gallup Poll in mid-May said 77 percent of respondents
had not heard enough about Bentsen to offer an opinion on the Texas
senator.
   Dukakis chose Bentsen off a short list of seven possible running
mates, including Jackson, Sens. John Glenn of Ohio, Albert Gore Jr.
of Tennessee and Bob Graham of Florida and Reps. Richard Gephardt
of Missouri and Lee Hamilton of Indiana.
   Dukakis sent Brountas, his campaign chairman, to Washington on
Monday to meet with Jackson. It was when Brountas returned to
Boston to meet with the Massachusetts governor that the decision
was made.
   ``If it was offered to me, I would accept it,'' Jackson said
after meeting with Brountas. He said it was ``self-evident'' that
he wants the No. 2 spot on the ticket.
   He continued to stir his careful mixture of promise and problems
for Dukakis, saying, ``We intend to have an effective, informative
convention that would inspire our nation, unify our party and take
us to victory.''
   Democrats looking for a peaceful convention saw new signs of
hope Monday, as party chief Paul Kirk proclaimed the battles over
the party platform might be resolved without a messy fight on the
floor.
   ``I don't expect that there will be any so-called floor fights
on the platform,'' Kirk told reporters in Atlanta. ``There may be
differences of opinion. There may be agreements to disagree. All
the indications that I have are whatever differences had existed,
they are gradually being worked out.''
   Bush was already sharpening his rhetoric in preparation for a
fall campaign that continues to look like a tight battle.
   ``I am not the one who feels that the problems of agricultural
America can be solved by planting more Belgian endive,'' Bush told
a farm meeting in Washington.
   The vice president was referring to the Massachusetts governor's
suggestion in early 1987 in Iowa that crop diversification was a
solution to agricultural problems, pointing to farmers' experience
in his home state.
   A tight race was the analysis from the latest CBS News-New York
Times poll.
   It put Dukakis ahead of Bush by a 47-39 margin among 947
registered voters surveyed by telephone last week. The margin of
error was plus or minus three percentage points.

   Sigourney Weaver says she wasn't ready for
stardom when she graduated from Yale in 1974, unlike classmate
Meryl Streep.
   ``In addition to being terrifically talented, Meryl was
immediately ready to be successful,'' the actress says in the
August issue of Vanity Fair magazine. ``I wasn't.''
   Instead, Ms. Weaver said, she wanted a bank teller's job for the
security. Then she remembered her vow to prove to her parents,
one-time NBC President Pat Weaver and British-trained actress
Elizabeth Inglis, that she could make it. And she did with hits
like ``Ghostbusters'' and ``Alien.''
   Her latest film, ``Gorillas in the Mist,'' is based on the life
of slain American zoologist Dian Fossey, who studied mountain
gorillas in Africa.
   Although the picture is done, the actress says she cannot forget
Fossey.
   While filming Mike Nichols' new movie, ``Working Girl,'' she
said she saw a stuffed gorilla. ``I had to go to my camper. I don't
know what it was _ the gorillas or Dian.''
   ``I know this,'' she said. ``No one could have been more
surprised than me. Usually, by the time I've finished a movie, I
feel I'm finished. But Dian keeps coming back.''

   Just call him ``Dr. Rock.'' That's what
pop star Paul McCartey suggested after he received an honorary
doctorate from the University of Sussex on Tuesday.
   McCartney, 46, said he found the ceremony quite formal.
   ``I kept feeling like I ought to run out into the middle of the
stage and shout something, I felt naked without a guitar,'' the
former Beatle said.
   McCartney said he didn't do too well at school, so it was
``great to get this degree without having to revise (study) for
it.''
   University spokesman Geoff Ivey said McCartney was given the
award for ``giving pleasure to millions'' during his career.
   ``He has also lived in our county for many years and we have
come to think of him as an adopted son of Sussex,'' Ivey added.
   McCartney, his wife, Linda, and their four children live on an
estate near Rye, East Sussex.

<TEXT>
   Two U.S. helicopters traded fire with a
pair of Iranian gunboats after the boats attacked a tanker in the
northern Persian Gulf today, U.S. military sources said.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there was
no damage to the aircraft and it was not known whether the boats
were damaged in the clash, which took place at about 7 p.m.
   The sources said the helicopters, off the U.S. missile frigate
Nicholas, were responding to a distress call from a Panamanian-flag
tanker west of Iran's Farsi island.
   ``The helicopters took fire from the two small boats and
returned fire with rockets,'' said a U.S. official. ``There was no
damage to the helos (helicopters). We have no damage assessment on
the boats.''
   Shipping executives said the attack on the tanker started a fire
in the engine room of the 81,282-ton Universal Monarch, but that
the crew put out the blaze on their own and that no one aboard the
vessel was injured.
   It was the second time in less than two weeks that an American
warship responded to a distress signal from a neutral ship in the
gulf. The previous time was on July 2 in the southern gulf, when
another frigate intervened to drive off Iranian speedboats
attacking a Danish tanker.
   The next day, the USS Vincennes shot down an Iranian passenger
jet following an exchange of fire with Iranian boats. Iran said 290
people aboard the plane died. The United States said the plane was
shot down in the mistaken belief it was an attacking warplane. The
Reagan administration has promised to make reparations to the
families of the victims.
   The London-based Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit said the
Universal Monarch is owned by a Hong Kong company and managed by
the Japanese company Tokudo Shasen K.K., of Tokyo.
   The vessel was sailing empty to pick up cargo from the Khafji
fields, owned jointly by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, the executives
said.
   Farsi island is a stronghold for Revolutionary Guards who often
carry out attacks in the gulf.
   In the so-called ``tanker war'' _ an offshoot of the 8-year-old
Iran-Iraq war _ Iran attacks neutral shipping in the gulf in
retaliation for Iraqi raids on its oil tankers.
   Last Thursday, Iraqi warplanes raided two supertankers in the
vicinity of Iran's Kharg Island oil terminal at the northeastern
end of the gulf. The Greek-owned 264,108-ton Fellowship L and the
Cypriot 215,780-ton Star Ray were set afire, but no casualties were
reported.
   The Iranian ship attacks have continued despite a broadened role
for U.S. Navy warships in the gulf, enabling them to protect
commercial vessels even if they do not fly the Stars and Stripes.
   Iran has attacked two commercial vessels _ the Norwegian-owned
tanker Berge Strand and the Romanian-owned freighter Plataresti _
since the USS Vincennes shot down the Iranian passenger jet.

   Richard Thornburgh is preparing to become the
next attorney general at a time when Justice Department and White
House officials are trying to launch a major anti-drug initiative
in Congress.
   Acting Associate Attorney General Frank Keating said this week
the Reagan administration is anxious to get legislation revamping
portions of immigration law to make it easier to deport aliens
convicted of drug trafficking and to bar the entry of drug
traffickers into the United States.
   Keating said that this is one of about 30 measures the
administration wants Congress to enact, including one authorizing
the death penalty for persons convicted of murder while engaged in
a continuing drug enterprise.
   However, congressional Democrats have yet to appoint anyone to
President Reagan's joint executive-legislative branch drug task
force, which was supposed to shape the legislation, and
congressional sources have said the Democrats don't plan to
participate.
   ``The legislative agenda is stalled,'' Keating told a news
conference. ``We think this is an issue which transcends party
lines.'' Anti-drug legislation of some kind appears inevitable in
this election year.
   Drug trafficking, as well as two other top Justice Department
priorities, organized crime and pornography, have been at the top
of Thornburgh's own agenda. His attacks on the three while U.S.
attorney for western Pennsylvania in the early 1970s led to his
appointment in 1975 by President Ford as assistant attorney general
in charge of the department's criminal division.
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III may still be in office to
handle two other major items on the department's agenda. Meese said
Tuesday that his own plans ``haven't ... totally jelled yet,'' but
that he still plans to leave toward the end of July or early
August, as he said last week when he announced he was resigning.
   Meese reiterated through department spokesman Patrick Korten
that he hopes to decide whether the Detroit Free Press and the
Detroit News should be allowed to merge their advertising,
circulation and production operations under the Newspaper
Preservation Act.
   Meese also may still be in office when the department decides
whether to seek an indictment of former Philippine President
Ferdinand Marcos, who has been investigated by a number of federal
grand juries since he was ousted in February 1986. Marcos lives in
exile in Honolulu.
   However, Meese probably will be gone by the time federal
prosecutors are ready to seek indictments in the Pentagon
investigation, which is being coordinated by the U.S. attorney's
office in Alexandria, Va. The indictment are not expected until
late in the year.
   Also on the Justice Department agenda: Senate confirmation
hearings late this month for Keating, Deputy Attorney General
Harold Christensen and criminal division chief Edward Dennis. All
are currently serving in acting capacities.
   Christensen and Dennis are replacing former Deputy Attorney
General Arnold Burns and Assistant Attorney General William Weld,
the criminal division head, whose protest resignations March 29
over Meese's continued tenure brought accusations of a serious
leadership gap in the department.
   The department under Thornburgh also will be coping with the
issue of drug testing. The program would subject 1,800 Justice
employees in sensitive jobs to mandatory, random urinalysis. The
employees, many of them lawyers, are suing the department, saying
the program that could begin shortly violates their constitutional
right to due process and to protection against unreasonable
searches and seizures.

   Gov. Buddy Roemer, who vanquished
three-term Gov. Edwin Edwards with a reform campaign, finished his
first regular legislative session with many more victories than
failures, lawmakers say.
   During an 85-day session that ended late Monday, the Legislature
approved a balanced budget, a teacher pay raise, a campaign finance
reform measure and a framework to revive the state's stagnant
economy.
   ``When we started 120 days ago, this state was wounded, this
state was hurt, this state was down,'' Roemer told a joint
House-Senate meeting before adjournment. ``This is a good state and
we pulled together to try to bring it back right again.''
   ``I think overall the governor has been successful with the
programs he has been pushing. He's won far more than he has lost,''
said Sen. William Jefferson.
   When he took office March 15 after defeating Edwards last fall,
Roemer inherited an accumulated deficit of $1 billion that
threatened to bankrupt a state saddled with a corrupt image he
often described as that of a ``banana republic.''
   Edwards spent much of his third term successfully defending
himself against federal racketeering charges.
   By the close of the lawmaking session, Roemer could point to
passage of his plan for overhauling public schools and an $8
billion state budget based on conservative oil price projections in
this energy-producing state.
   On the final day of the session, lawmakers also granted the
governor continuance of the authority to make emergency budget cuts
it granted him during a special legislative session shortly after
he took office.
   However, Roemer must first obtain the blessing of a legislative
panel.
   ``I wish reductions to the budget would have been greater,''
said Rep. Allen Bradley. ``I'm not trying to be critical because we
did make substantial reductions, but not as much as I think we
could have.''
   The Legislature also approved restrictions on personal
contributions to political candidates and contributions from
political action committees. Candidates also will be required to
report all donations and expenditures.
   During his campaign, Roemer said he took no PAC money and no
contribution larger than $5,000.
   Despite the progress, Louisiana's fiscal problems are not
solved, said Sen. Don Kelly, an administration floor leader.
   ``These problems have not been cured. They won't be cured until
we have true fiscal reform,'' said Kelly.

   An analysis of computer tapes from the
cruiser Vincennes has been delivered to experts trying to
reconstruct the shooting down of an Iranian jetliner, U.S.
officials said Tuesday.
   The tapes were flown to the United States last week for analysis
at a Navy laboratory in Virgnia. The analysis has now been flown to
the Persian Gulf accompanied by two specialists who will present
the analysis to the six-member team of investigators.
   As the secrecy-shrouded inquiry entered its second week, the
focus was on resolving conflicts over the altitude and other
details of Iran Air's Flight 655 just before the A300 Airbus was
blown apart over the Strait of Hormuz on July 3, killing all 290
people aboard.
   U.S. military officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the computer analysis could prove crucial in determining
whether a misreading of target data by the Vincennes' sophisticated
Aegis air defense system led the ship's commander, Capt. Will C.
Rogers III, to fire at what he believed was an Iranian F-14 fighter.
   The Pentagon said the Airbus was emitting a confusing mixture of
identification signals, one typical of a commercial airliner and
another similar to that which U.S. ships had received previously
from Iranian F-14s.
   While the Vincennes initially reported the jetliner at about
9,200 feet and descending to about 7,900 feet before it was hit,
data from two other U.S. warships indicates it was nearer to 12,000
feet and either flying level or climbing, U.S. officials in
Washington were quoted as saying.
   One of the ships, the frigate Elmer Montgomery, was close by at
the time the plane was shot down and the other, the missile frigate
John H. Sides, was about 17 miles away.
   Both ships monitored the military radio messages in which, U.S.
officials said, Rogers tried repeatedly to make contact with the
jetliner, and tracked it on radar. But they did not record the
sequence of events on computer tape, said a Navy official, who
asked not to be named.
   ``Neither of those ships has anything even close to Aegis, so
what they could provide is pretty limited by comparison,'' said the
official.
   The Montgomery, a 3,800-ton frigate designed for anti-submarine
warfare, was with the Vincennes during a clash with Iranian
gunboats that occurred less than an hour before the Iran Air plane
was shot down.
   Investigators earlier interviewed officers of all three ships
under oath. The Vincennes remains anchored off Bahrain, but the
Montgomery and the John H. Sides returned to duty several days ago.
   The investigators, according to a Navy official, are trying to
collect anything that has some bearing on the disaster.
   He said this includes information that only Iran could provide,
such as whether a military plane might have played a role in the
confusion or warned the Airbus. A senior U.S. officer said last
week that any direct access to Iranian officals or data appeared
``highly doubtful.''
   U.S. officials said earlier that an Iranian scout plane, a
U.S.-built P-3 Orion, apparently was airborne and could have
monitored and relayed the Vincennes' warning messages to the
jetliner.
   Iranian pilots and others have been quoted as saying the pilot
of Flight 655 would have been so busy talking with controllers in
Bandar Abbas, Tehran and Dubai, his destination across the gulf,
that he would not necessarily have heard the cruiser's radioed
warnings on the civilian radio frequency.
   Iranian officials have not acknowledged that the plane was
transmitting a military identification signal on ``Mode 2,'' the
frequency reserved for military use, as the Americans claim.
   A U.S. source said the IFF, or identification friend or foe,
codes used by Iranian F-14s had been given to the Vincennes by the
missile cruiser Wainwright, which the Vincennes replaced on gulf
duty in late May.
   The Airbus' flight recorder also could provide important clues
to the plane's altitude and other details, but Iran's navy
commander, Rear Adm. Mohammed Hossein Malekzadegan, said on Monday
there was no truth to reports that it had been recovered.

<HEAD>Reagan Promises To Work Hard For Weapons Sale To Kuwait</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan assured Kuwait's prime
minister Tuesday that he will continue to push for a proposed sale
of Maverick missiles to the Persian Gulf state.
   Posing for photographers as he met with Crown Prince and Prime
Minister Sheik Saad Al-Abudllah Al-Sabah, Reagan said, ``You bet
we're going to fight for it. We want very much to complete that.''
   Asked if there was any chance of success, he replied, ``I think
so.''
   Last week, the Senate voted to strip the Mavericks from a $1.8
billion arms package that included 40 F-18 fighter-bombers for the
tiny oil-rich gulf country. Critics contended the missiles could be
turned against Israel in the event of a Middle East war.
   But a senior U.S. official, briefing reporters in advance of
Sheik Saad's visit, said Israel still would retain a strategic edge
over any combination of hostile Arab countries, even if the
purchase were approved.
   The Senate voted against the Mavericks in an appropriations
amendment that is likely to be approved by Congress. That does not
kill the sale, however, since arms purchases are considered final
unless both the Senate and House reject them down within 30 days
after they are formally announced.
   In his formal remarks at a departure ceremony for the first
Kuwaiti leader to visit here in 20 years, Reagan said, ``We
strongly support the request for F-18 aircraft and accompanying
weapons now pending before Congress.''
   Skeik Saad, in his response, thanked Reagan for U.S. support.
   He said Kuwait was grateful for America's willingness to escort
its oil tankers in the war-torn Persian Gulf, and said ``we
appreciate the effective role of the United States as a superpower
in resolving issues of world peace. ....''
   A U.S. official, describing the talks Tuesday on condition of
anonymity, quoted Reagan as telling Sheik Saad, ``We will keep
pitching for F-18s.'' The official said both the United States and
Kuwait consider the Maverick missiles part of ``an integrated
package'' and want it to stay that way.
   Kuwait concluded a weapons deal with the Soviet Union over the
weekend, and U.S. officials have expressed concern about American
allies turning to other countries to obtain armaments. Saudi Arabia
agreed to buy sophisticated weaponry from Britain after a U.S.
sales package ran into congressional opposition.
   The administration officials said the Kuwaitis clearly ``have
the means'' to purchase weapons through other channels if they wish.

   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen is ``more a plus than he is
a minus'' on women's issues, but his stance on Contra aid and
defense spending could alienate women voters in November, women's
groups said Tuesday.
   The Texas senator, Democrat Michael Dukakis' running mate
choice, offers a mixed record that could turn some women voters to
Republican George Bush, especially if Bush picks a female running
mate, said Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for
Women.
   ``If you're a Democrat it's very worrisome,'' she said.
   Polls have shown that Bush is troubled by a ``gender gap'' that
has many women leaning toward the Democratic candidate in the
presidential race. But the choice of Bentsen doesn't solidify the
women's vote in the Democratic column, the groups said.
   NOW and the bipartisan National Women's Political Caucus rated
Bentsen's record as generally good, based on his support during the
100th Congress of civil rights legislation, Medicaid funding for
abortion in the District of Columbia and his opposition to the
Supreme Court nomination of Robert Bork. Bentsen has also supported
the Equal Rights Amendment.
   ``Basically, he's more a plus than he is a minus,'' said Ms.
Yard. ``I think the one thing that disturbs us about him is that he
is very much a hawk. He was pro-Contra aid, and for all the money
spent on defense. He is really business as usual and that's why the
voters want change.''
   Women are more strongly opposed to defense spending and to
Contra aid, she said, because they ``want this world to turn into a
world of negotiation and stop this nonsense about fighting.''
   Irene Natividad, chairman of the National Women's Political
Caucus, said women's groups had not expected this year that
Democrats would name a woman vice president candidate because ``the
sense was that the Democratic Party felt they had already done a
women on the ticket.''
   Geraldine Ferraro, who was Walter Mondale's running mate on the
losing Democratic ticket in 1984, said she was ``delighted'' by the
choice of Bentsen.
   She said she was not disappointed a man had been chosen, since
there were not enough women in national political office to provide
Dukakis with a good choice for a female running mate.
   ``If we had a woman in that Senate seat or in the statehouse
that had the credentials that Senator Bentsen has, I, of course,
would be disappointed. But because we don't have a woman in that
spot, I am not,'' she said in a telephone interview from New York.
   Ms. Ferraro said Bentsen ``has been fine on issues that I and
many women care about and in addition to that he's going to be a
very strong help to the ticket, rounding it out beautifully so that
with a Democrat in the White House it's going to make a difference
for the women in this country.''
   Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., who explored the possibility of
running for president in 1988, said that problems with the economy
are more likely to make women vote Democratic and that Bentsen, as
head of the Senate Finance Committee, offered strong credentials on
that issue.
   ``All the gender gap polling is showing that women are truly
understanding what's wrong with the economy because they're the
ones out there trying to juggle two jobs. They're going to be very
pleased with Bentsen,'' she said.
   ``The real gender gap is generated from women struggling to meet
the family budget every month. Somehow I don't think they're going
to see Bush as identifying with that problem,'' she said.

   A Pan American jet carrying 182
passengers on a flight from London to Detroit made an emergency
landing in Iceland Tuesday, after one of its two engines had to be
shut down, aviation officials said.
   No one was reported injured.
   The Airbus A-310 was 310 miles southwest of Iceland when its
pilot noticed an oil leak in one engine and had to turn it off,
Icelandic federal aviation officials said.
   The pilot reported the engine failure and an aircraft of the
Icelandic Civil Aviation Agency was sent to meet the plane and
guide it to Leif Ericson International Airport at Keflavik, where
it landed 45 minutes later, the agency said.
   No spokesman for Pan American World Airways could be reached
immediately at the airline's London offices.

   Agriculture and weather service officials said Tuesday this
week's rain eased the drought in Illinois but not in Ohio, while
Kentucky officials pleaded for more water-hauling trucks to help
people whose wells have run dry.
   In Massachusetts, a state environmental official said the Bay
State was not in the same condition as the drought-stricken Midwest
but noted a drop in July's rainfall and urged conservation.
   In Johnson City, Tenn., the public library canceled its annual
worm race because the critters have burrowed deeper into the soil
in search of moisture.
   Showers and thunderstorms dampened parts of the Midwest and
Southwest from Arkansas into southern and eastern Missouri and
across southern Illinois and southern Indiana. A flash flood watch
was posted for parts of north central Texas after heavy overnight
rain.
   Farmers in southern Illinois reported 24-hour rainfall ranging
from 0.2 to nearly 4 inches, but agriculture officials said more
was needed to offset dry conditions.
   ``Everything looks so good with a bit of rain over the past 24
hours,'' said Du Quoin farmer Herman Krone, whose 2,800-acre farm
President Reagan plans to visit Thursday during a tour of the
drought-ravaged area.
   However, Krone noted, almost one-third of his 1,200 acres of
corn already have been lost.
   In Ohio, the National Weather Service said scattered showers in
the last week have had virtually no impact. Conditions in
southwestern Ohio were rated extreme, the worst category listed
under the index used to measure drought severity. In the
northeastern part of the state, conditions are rated severe, the
next-highest category, the service said.
   At least 50 truckloads of hay gathered from the Carolinas and
Virginia are being shipped to Ohio on Thursday in a drive organized
by the Charlotte Motor Speedway and the National Association for
Stock Car Auto Racing.
   The Kentucky Division of Disaster and Emergency Services issued
a plea Tuesday for more water-hauling trucks to help people whose
wells have dried up. The heaviest concentration of homes in need of
water are in extreme northern Kentucky, just south of Cincinnati,
according to agency spokesman Don Armstrong.
   Rain Monday and Tuesday was the first significant rainfall
Kentucky has had since early June but was ``far from a salvation,''
according to Krit Stubblefield, a spokesman for the state
Department of Agriculture.
   The showers came too late to save corn but could buy more time
for soybeans and tobacco, he said.
   In Massachusetts, state Environmental Affairs Secretary James S.
Hoyte noted that the state's largest reservoir system was 13 feet
below its usual level and called for increased water conservation.
   ``We are taking out of the reservoir far more than nature can
replenish,'' said Hoyte, noting that rainfall for July is only
one-quarter of the average rainfall for the month.
   In northeastern Georgia, the state Department of Natural
Resources ordered the city of Toccoa to impose an immediate ban on
outdoor watering. City officials had asked for an exemption from
state-mandated water restrictions because they believed a new $3
million project to draw water from Lake Yonah had made the city
virtually ``drought-proof.''
   The Gwinnett County Commission agreed to pay a $75,000 state
fine for exceeding its June allocation of water from Lake Lanier,
but refused to enact tougher outdoor watering restrictions for
county residents. Gwinnett, northeast of Atlanta, is one of the
country's fastest-growing areas.

   Former Pennsylvania Gov. Richard L.
Thornburgh, picked by President Reagan to head the troubled Justice
Department, pledged Tuesday to ``follow the evidence wherever it
may lead'' in the matter of outgoing Attorney General Edwin Meese
III.
   Thornburgh declined to answer questions about Meese in any
detail, however, in an appearance in the White House briefing room
with Reagan, who announced the nomination and urged swift
confirmation by the Senate. The administration will be in office
for only six more months.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Thornburgh's
nomination will be sent to the Senate during the week of July 25,
when Congress will be back from a weeklong recess that begins
Friday so that members can attend the Democratic National
Convention.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, the senior Republican on
the Senate Judiciary Committee, said that he hoped hearings would
``begin right away'' and added that they can ``if the Democrats
don't delay the matter.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, the No. 2 Democrat on
the committee, which will review Thornburgh's nomination, said he
expected a rapid confirmation.
   ``I have the greatest respect for Dick Thornburgh,'' Kennedy
said. ``The state of justice in America would be very different
today if Dick Thornburgh had been attorney general for the past 3{
years instead of Ed Meese.''
   Although no date has been set for a confirmation hearing, a
staff source at the Senate Judiciary Committee, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said, ``It's reasonable to assume'' a
hearing will be held in early August, with a full Senate vote by
Aug. 12. Congress begins a three-week recess after Aug. 12.
   Meese himself was enthusiastic about Reagan's choice of
Thornburgh. ``I think it's excellent. I had the opportunity to talk
in some detail with the president about the various candidates and
I think Dick Thornburgh is actually at the top of the list,'' Meese
said.
   ``He's an outstanding person and I'm sure he'll do an excellent
job,'' Meese added.
   Thornburgh, 55, had been mentioned as a possible running mate
for Vice President George Bush, the likely Republican presidential
nominee. And since Thornburgh's name surfaced on Monday as Reagan's
probable choice for the attorney general's job, there was talk that
the former Pennsylvania governor would be kept in the Justice post
during a Bush administration.
   Fitzwater said Vice President George Bush was consulted about
the nomination.
   On the question of whether Thornburgh would remain as attorney
general if Bush were elected president, Bush spokesman Stephen Hart
said, ``I think it's premature to even speculate about that.''
   George Bush himself said only that Thornburgh ``will be an
outstanding attorney general, just as he was an outstanding
governor. I strongly support his nomination.''
   Thornburgh was asked if he expected to remain after January in
the event of a Bush victory. ``I obviously can't speak for the vice
president,'' he replied. ``But I think that law enforcement is a
24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week proposition. And whether you're on
the job for six days or six months or six years, it is a full-time
effort. ... ''
   Meese, whose affairs have been under investigation by
independent counsel James McKay, announced last week that he would
resign by early August. Both Meese and Reagan have said that they
believe McKay's 830-page report, which has been filed in court but
not made public, vindicated the attorney general.
   Among the matters McKay probed were Meese's assistance to
Wedtech, a Bronx, N.Y., defense contractor under investigation for
payoffs to win government contracts; Meese's actions in connection
with a proposed $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline project; and whether
he took actions favorable to regional Bell telephone companies at a
time he held $14,000 in telephone stock.
   When asked whether he planned to look into the Meese matter,
Thornburgh said, ``I really can't answer any substantive questions
at this time.''
   ``My intention, and this is in any area, is to follow the
evidence wherever it may lead,'' he said. ``And not knowing what
that evidence is, I can't give you a prediction.''
   Meese could still face an internal department review of his
actions. Portions of McKay's sealed report are said to question
Meese's candor and ethics.
   Fitzwater said Reagan had given Thornburgh no advice on the
issue.
   ``Those matters are all left to the incoming attorney general,''
the spokesman said.
   Reagan called Thornburgh ``the ideal choice for attorney
general,'' saying that in six years as U.S. attorney for western
Pennsylvania, he was ``a prosecutor's prosecutor ... a tough-minded
crime buster.''
   ``I urge the Senate to move quickly to confirm him as well as
our other Justice Department nominees so they can roll up their
sleeves and get to work enforcing the laws of the land,'' the
president said.
   Also awaiting Senate confirmation are the deputy attorney
general, Harold Christensen; the No. 3 person in the department,
Associate Attorney General Francis Keating; and the criminal
division chief, Edward Dennis.
   Christensen and Dennis have been on the job since early June;
Keating has been at work about a month longer. All were appointed
on an acting basis by Reagan.
   Christensen and Dennis are replacing former Deputy Attorney
General Arnold Burns and Assistant Attorney General William Weld,
whose protest resignations March 29 over Meese's continued tenure
brought accusations of a serious leadership gap in the department.
   As a U.S. attorney, Thornburgh's attacks on organized cime,
public corruption and drug trafficking led to his 1975 appointment
by President Ford as assistant attorney general in charge of the
Justice Department's criminal division.
   Thornburgh gained national recognition in 1979 when, after only
72 days as governor, he was faced with the nation's worst
commercial nuclear accident, at Three Mile Island near the state
capital of Harrisburg.
   Six years later, he said he learned several lessons from the
accident. They included: forget partisanship during crises, don't
be afraid to ``scramble the organization chart,'' and ``respect but
do not depend on the news media.''
   Thornburgh was bared by law from seeking a third term as
governor. H left Pennsylvania at the end of 1986 to head the
Institute of Politics at Harvard University's Kennedy School of
Government.

<HEAD>Cities Increased Fees, Raised Taxes In Face Of Federal Aid
Cutbacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN PUTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's cities, encumbered by burgeoning
budget gaps spawned by federal aid cutbacks, sharply increased
local fees this fiscal year and many also raised property taxes, a
study reported Tuesday.
   Over half the country's major cities face potential deficits,
although some will be able to dip into reserves to avoid finishing
the year in the red, said the study by the National League of
Cities.
   ``The present trends are dangerous and potentially
devastating,'' said Alan Beals, executive director of the league, a
national organization of local governments. Beals called the
nation's domestic policies on cities ``indifferent at best and
destructive at worst.''
   The league report, titled ``City Fiscal Conditions in 1988,''
describes how 347 communities _ from large cities such as Los
Angeles to smaller towns like Yankton, S.D. _ are coping with the
end, two years ago, of the federal revenue sharing program.
   The survey found that 67 percent increased existing fees and
charges for city services in the 1988 fiscal year, while 44 percent
reduced spending this year on capital construction projects.
Fifty-five percent cut back the growth of their operating budgets
and 41 percent raised property taxes.
   Those figures were higher than 1987, when 58 percent raised fees
and 38 percent raised property taxes over the year before.
   In addition, 37 percent of the cities said they had instituted
new fees. Another 14 percent reduced city services.
   Cities overwhelmingly cited federal cutbacks as the reason for
their budgetary straits. Almost half of the cities that cut
services said less federal money was the main reason, and 64
percent of those who scaled back capital projects cited the loss of
revenue sharing.
   ``The backbone of America _ our cities and towns _ is bending
under an increasing load,'' Beals said at a news conference.
   ``Whether this burden will continue to grow more cumbersome, or
whether it will be relieved through a more responsible set of
national policies is one of the urgent questions of the 1988
elections and for the next administration,'' Beals said at a news
conference on the report.
   The news conference was held as word came that Michael Dukakis,
the likely Democratic presidential nominee, had picked Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen of Texas as his running mate. Bentsen heads the Senate
Finance Committee and has worked with the league on a number of
issues affecting the nation's cities, Beals noted.
   ``We found him to be very open-minded and responsive (and he
has) given us a very sympathetic hearing,'' Beals said.
   The report measured spending estimates for the 1988 fiscal year
_ the 12-month period that ended June 30 _ which the report
acknowledged are not yet final.
   It said 50 percent of the cities expect expenditures to exceed
revenues in 1988, but noted that cities usually are pessimistic in
such projections. The actual percentage of cities that finish their
fiscal years with deficits is expected to be lower, since
municipalities facing shortfalls dip into reserves carried over
from previous years to balance their budgets, the report said. In
1987, 33 percent of the cities surveyed by the league actually
reported shortfalls, down from 40 percent in 1986.
   More than half those cities had surpluses in 1986 and 1987, but
only 24 percent said they expect to take in more than they spend in
the 1988 fiscal year.
   The survey also found that 25 percent of the cities had actually
seen revenues from all sources decline in 1988 from last year.
   In other areas of spending, the survey found that 25 percent of
the cities had reduced the number of city workers, 24 percent had
raised or imposed new fees for developers and 22 percent had frozen
municipal hiring. Eighteen percent had instituted new taxes or
raised sales taxes.

<TEXT>
   Four inmates, two of them convicted
murderers, escaped a maximum-security prison after tricking guards
by putting dummies made from stuffed long johns in their cots,
authorities said Tuesday.
   Guards twice counted the dummies during overnight bed checks,
said prison spokesman David White. The inmates went to a laundry
area, slid down a homemade rope, and moved along a shallow ditch
along a fence not visible from the guard tower, he said.
   ``At the 7 a.m. count, when there wasn't any movement, they were
discovered missing,'' White said.
   It was the first escape from the Maximum Security Unit at
Tucker, in central Arkansas, about 30 miles southeast of Little
Rock.
   White said the dummies were made of white thermal underwear
stuffed with blankets. The heads were made of white stocking caps
with pieces of human hair taped to them. Two of the four worked in
the laundry room, he said.
   Sgt. Fred Brown of the Correction Department said all the
inmates were in individual cells.
   The escapees were identified as convicted murderers James Ray
Renton, 50, and Raymond Coble, 29; Tommy Winberry, 38, convicted of
two counts of attempted murder, and David Fane, 31, convicted of
aggravated robbery and other crimes.
   Coble and Winberry escaped from another state prison in November
1986, White said, but were recaptured a short time later.
   Authorities were using an airplane, dogs and a roadblock in
their search for the escaped inmates.

<TEXT>
   Ambassador Richard Melton, who was ordered by
the Nicaraguan government to leave the country, is believed to be
the fifth U.S. diplomat of his rank to be withdrawn at the request
of the host government over the past 15 years.
   Earlier this year, the U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Hume
Horan, was recalled by the United States because of personality
differences with King Fahd.
   Unlike Melton, however, Horan was not declared persona non grata
but Saudi authorities made clear the monarch's displeasure with
Horan, who spent only seven months in Saudi Arabia.
   Within days after Horan's recall, President Reagan nominated
Ambassador Walter Cutler to replace him.
   The case involving Melton is believed to be the first of its
kind since 1976 when the U.S. ambassador to Equatorial Guinea,
Herbert Spiro, was ordered out of the country. U.S. relations with
Equatorial Guinea were poor at the time because of unpredictable
behavior of President Masie Nguema and other factors.
   During that period, Spiro was the accredited ambassador to both
Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea but resided in Cameroon. He made
occasional visits to Equatorial Guinea. Full relations with that
country were not restored until 1979.
   In 1975, the U.S. ambassador to Zaire, Dean Hinton, was expelled
by President Mobutu Sese Seko for alleged interference in Zaire's
internal affairs.
   In 1973, Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley expelled
Ambassador Vincent Deroulet after the envoy had said the United
States refrained from interfering in the 1972 national elections in
Jamaica in return for a promise from Manley not to nationalize
certain U.S. business investments in Jamaica. Manley denied the
allegation.

   Jesse Jackson today called the selection of
Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as Michael Dukakis' running mate ``a
strategic move'' and said ``I'm too controlled ... to be angry'' at
being passed over.
   Jackson said he will support the ticket nominated at the
Democratic National Convention next week but brushed off questions
about whether he will campaign enthusiastically for the party.
   ``The approach he used today was of course a matter of his own
campaign making a strategic move to solidify his organization. That
is his right to do,'' Jackson said at a news conference.
   Jackson said he first learned of the selection from reporters
who met him at an airport here this morning. He said Dukakis later
phoned him, but they did not have a lengthy discussion.
   Asked if he was angry, Jackson replied: ``No, I'm too
controlled, I'm too clear, I'm too mature to be angry. I'm focused
on what we must do to keep hope alive...''
   Jackson nearly crossed paths at the airport with Bentsen, who
was preparing to leave for Boston. The two did not meet.
   Jackson declined comment on most of the questions he was asked
by reporters as he walked to his car at Washington's National
Airport. When asked if Dukakis had informed him of a decision, he
said, ``No.''
   The night before, Jackson stated publicly for the first time
that he would accept the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket and
said he assured Dukakis' talent scout that he would be a loyal vice
president.
   But Jackson stopped short Monday night of pledging loyalty if he
is not chosen for the ticket.
   Jackson told reporters that would depend on discussions yet to
be held between him and the Massachusetts governor, the certain
nominee when Democrats convene in Atlanta next week.
   Jackson and Dukakis campaign chairman Paul Brountas met with
reporters after a two-hour private session here Monday as Brountas
neared the end of the running mate search for Dukakis.
   Jackson, who has said repeatedly he had earned serious
consideration for the No. 2 spot, previously had demurred at saying
whether he would accept a bid. He joked to a farm group before the
job interview, ``So far Dukakis has not accepted my offer and I
have not refused his.''
   But there were no jokes after the session with Brountas,
Jackson's second interview for the job.
   ``If it was offered to me, I would accept it,'' he said. ``If
it's not offered to me, then how I respond will be based upon many
things that we've not yet discussed.''
   Jackson, who technically remains in contention for the
Democratic nomination even though Dukakis has a numerical lock on a
first-ballot victory at the convention, said, ``We intend to have
an effective, informative convention that would inspire our nation,
unify our party and take us to victory.'' He said they did not
discuss outstanding differences on the party platform.
   He said he gave Brountas ``my candid views as to the office of
the vice presidency and shared with him, when asked, what I thought
my qualifications to be and my vision of that role.''
   Brountas called it ``an excellent meeting ... very productive.
It served the purpose for which it was intended, and that is to
continue and to conclude the background check phase of the
selection process.''
   Brountas, who flew back to Boston Monday night, said, ``I plan
to review my meeting with Reverend Jackson with the governor, and
then it's up to the governor.''
   Jackson adviser John White, who took part in the meeting, told
reporters that although Brountas did not say when Dukakis would
announce his decision, ``I got the impression it was going to be
very soon ... in the next couple of days.''
   Jackson, asked to rate his chances, said, ``There is no way of
judging that.''
   Asked if the interview could have been a charade, Jackson said:
``I have no basis to challenge the intergrity of Mr. Brountas or
Gov. Dukakis. If this is just a charade, it is a great waste of
their time, at a time when time is precious.''
   Asked if he would consider having his name placed in nomination
for vice president if Dukakis chooses someone else, Jackson said,
``That's not under consideration.''
   Jackson, asked if Brountas had asked him to promise loyalty to
Dukakis, said: ``He did ask it. The answer is yes because that's
the right thing to do.'' But Jackson made clear he was only talking
about loyalty as a running mate.
   He said they talked about not only the requirements of the vice
presidency, but ``the latitude. No one, of course, would be asked
to do anything illegal or unconstitutional.''
   ``So long as there is room for serious discussion, debate and
deliberation, maturity requires that you agree to agree (and) that
you agree to disagree. ... '' said Jackson. On ``your best day,
your point of view may prevail. At your worst, your point of view
simply may be a matter of influence.
   ``I'm one to support the party. I've done that down through the
years.''
   Earlier, Jackson said, ``If I am not on the team, then the
governor must determine who the team members are and what role they
will play.'' He said he was seeking ``a partnership of equity and
shared responsibility.''
   Asked how his followers would respond if he is left off the
ticket, Jackson said: ``Let's take it one day at a time. My
constituency is tough and matured, enduring, loyal but also
responsible as it seeks its rightful place in our party's
leadership. It has earned partnership in our party.''

   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, selected by Michael
Dukakis on Tuesday as his Democratic running mate, will also
continue his bid for a fourth term in the Senate, a dual campaign
made legal in Texas in 1959 to let Lyndon B. Johnson run two races.
   It worked for Johnson. After losing the 1960 Democratic
presidential nomination to John F. Kennedy, Johnson was elected
vice president and won his Senate race.
   But Johnson's wins cost Democrats the Senate seat. Republican
John Tower later won a special election for the post, which is
still held by the GOP.
   If Bentsen wins both races this year, his Senate seat would
become vacant in January. Texas Gov. Bill Clements, a Republican,
would then appoint a replacement to serve until a special election.
   Clements also would set the special election day. Under state
law, that election could be on May 7, Aug. 13 or Nov. 12. Secretary
of State Jack Rains said Clements also could set an emergency
election on any date he chooses, but that move would have to be
cleared by the Justice Department.
   Rains said it usually takes 70 days to get Justice Department
approval for emergency elections.
   He also said the ``law is silent'' on any deadline for calling
the special election. Clements could wait as long as he pleased to
set it, according to Rains.
   Bentsen's November Senate opponent is U.S. Rep. Beau Boulter of
Amarillo, who has said it would not be fair for Bentsen to make
both races. But David Weeks, spokesman for the Bentsen Senate
campaign, said that is just what Bentsen will do.
   ``He is going to run a vigorous campaign for the Senate,'' Weeks
said.
   If he beats Boulter and also wins the vice presidency, Bentsen's
Senate seat would be vacant sometime in January. He could choose to
take the Senate oath on Jan. 3 and then resign his Senate seat when
he takes the vice presidential oath on Jan. 20. Bentsen could also
opt to skip the Senate oath, in which case the Senate seat would be
open Jan. 3.
   The special Senate election would be open to all candidates. The
1960 race drew 70 contenders. Tower won a runoff over Bill Blakley,
who had been appointed interim senator by then-Democratic Gov. John
Connally.
   Texas Democrats are confident they could hold the Senate seat if
Bentsen becomes vice president, especially if the Dukakis-Bentsen
ticket carries Texas in November.
   Texas' other U.S. senator is Phil Gramm, a Republican who won
the seat in 1984 after Tower retired.

<HEAD>State Department Rejects Two Gorbachev Proposals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department flatly rejected on
Tuesday a proposal by Soviet General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev
for a meeting of European leaders to achieve movement on reducing
conventional arms.
   Spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley called it ``an attempt to divert
attention from the business at hand.'' She also criticized, less
harshly, an offer to scale down air forces in Eastern Europe if
NATO agreed to forgo the redeployment of 72 U.S. jet fighter planes
in Italy.
   Mrs. Oakley said reducing forces in Europe was a subject for
consideration by the 16-member NATO alliance and not for the United
States and the Soviet Union to decide on their own.
   Gorbachev made the two proposals Monday in a speech to the
Polish parliament in Warsaw. The swift U.S. response reflected an
unwillingness to explore new approaches with Moscow in preference
to ongoing multinational negotiations in Vienna and proposed
bloc-to-bloc talks.
   ``We see little utility in proposing a new, different form,''
Mrs. Oakley said.
   The Vienna negotiations have not produced troop reductions. New
negotiations are supposed to be held between the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact in the Austrian capital,
but a date has not been set.
   The key problem appears to be a U.S. demand that the Soviet
Union simultaneously considers improving its human rights record.
   Mrs. Oakley, reading from a prepared statement, said ``vast
conventional superiority'' of the Warsaw Pact over NATO was the
cause of security problems in Europe.
   ``The first step toward rectifying this imbalance is to reach
East-West agreement on a negotiating mandate for new arms control
talks covering NATO and Warsaw Pact conventional forces from the
Atlantic to the Ural Mountains,'' she said.
   ``Mr. Gorbachev's proposal is an attempt to divert attention
from the business at hand in Vienna. If the Soviet Union is sincere
in its pursuit of conventional reductions it will work in Vienna to
achieve a muitally acceptable mandate and a balanced outcome ...''
   At the same time, the State Department spokeswoman criticized
Gorbachev's suggestion that the Warsaw Pact would consider
withdrawing ``analogus air force units'' from Eeastern Europe if
NATO aggreed to drop plans to move 72 U.S. F-16 warplanes to Italy
from Spain, where they were ordered to leave over three years.
   ``A matter of common alliance concern will not be undertaken on
a bilateral basis,'' Mrs. Oakley said. ``We are prepared to give
serious consideration to any proposal that will enhance the common
goal of enhancing stability in Europe.''
   She drew attention to a statement by Manfred Woerner of West
Germany, the new Secretary General of NAT0, rejecting the proposal.
He said the NATO alliance was concerned mostly with reducing land
forces. ``On their own, aircraft do not capture and hold
territory.''

   The Fourth of July was a day for flags,
fireworks and apple pie, but not for America's favorite pastime, at
least not on TV.
   According to figures from the A.C. Nielsen Co., ABC's ``Monday
Night Baseball'' scored its lowest rating ever, a 5.9 and a 14
share on July 4. The St. Louis Cardinals played the Los Angeles
Dodgers.
   Television audience levels are traditionally low on the Fourth
of July, because many viewers are outside celebrating the holiday.
   With the movie ``Bull Durham'' a hit at the box office,
fictional baseball was big on the small screen, though. NBC reran
the theatrical film ``The Natural'' on Sunday night, and it ranked
seventh with a 15.5 rating and 29 share.
   NBC's real-life game Friday night between the New York Mets and
the Houston Astros didn't do much better than ABC's, ranking 55th
with a rating of 6.4 and 14 share. The pre-game show was the
lowest-rated show of the week.
   But NBC won the week ending July 10 with an average, prime-time
rating of 11.5 and a 23 share. CBS was second with an 8.9. ABC had
an 8.6.
   Indicative of low holiday viewing of the networks, their
combined share was down to 58, compared with the 69 that is the
average for the season-to-date.
   Bad news for the networks was good news for the Fox Broadcasting
Co., whose No. 1 show, ``America's Most Wanted,'' had a record 14
share. The rating was 6.7. The show ranked 51st, the highest
Nielsen ranking for a Fox series.
   For the week ending July 10, The ``CBS Evening News'' was first
among the network newscasts with a rating of 9.6 and a 22 share.
ABC's ``World News Tonight'' had an 8.9 and 20. After three weeks
in second place, NBC dropped back to third with an 8.3 and 19.
   The rating is a percentage of the nation's estimated 88.6
million households with televisions. The share is a percentage of
sets in use.
   The highest-rated prime-time show of the week was NBC's ``Night
Court,'' with a 17.1 rating and 31 share. The rest of the top 10
were: ``A Different World,'' ``Cheers,'' ``The Cosby Show,''
``Golden Girls,'' ``L.A. Law,'' ``The Natural,'' all on NBC,
followed by ``60 Minutes'' and ``Murder, She Wrote'' on CBS, then
NBC's ``Hunter.''
   In a week with only 11 shows out of 76 that weren't reruns,
NBC's news documentary ``Guns, Guns Guns'' was ranked 21st with a
rating of 11.1 and a 20 share.
   ABC repeated its documentary ``Drugs: A Plague Upon the Land''
on Saturday and landed in 41st place with a rating of 8.3 and a 17
share. The documentary was repeated to set the stage for a
follow-up program on Monday.
   The lowest-rated shows of the week were: ``Rags to Riches,''
``Kane & Abel, Part 2,'' ``New York vs. Houston,'' ``The
Pretenders,'' ``High Mountain Rangers,'' ``St. Louis vs. Los
Angeles,'' ``Hothouse,'' ``Spot Marks the X, Part 2,''
``Supercarrier'' and NBC's baseball pre-game show.

<HEAD>Deaver Sentencing Set For Sept. 23</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former White House aide Michael K. Deaver was
ordered Tuesday to appear Sept. 23 to be sentenced for lying to a
grand jury and a House subcommittee about his lobbying business.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson also scheduled a
Sept. 15 hearing to take testimony about Deaver's problems with
alcohol, which the defense contended impaired the former
presidential aide's memory he gave sworn testimony two years ago.
   Testimony about Deaver's alcoholism would be offered by the
defense in an attempt to show there were mitigating circumstances
that would warrant a short sentence or probation.
   The hearing promises to be the first full airing of the
alcoholism issue, which was never raised during the trial because
Deaver's lawyers rested their case without calling any witnesses.
   A recovering alcoholic, Deaver was convicted Dec. 16, 1987 on
three counts of lying to a grand jury and a House subcommitee about
the lobbying business he formed in 1985 after resigning as
President Reagan's deputy chief of staff.
   Deaver, who was questioned by the panels about allegations that
his lobbying of former government colleagues violated federal
conflict-of-interest laws, could be sentenced up to five years in
prison for each of the perjury convictions.
   The sentencing was stayed on Feb. 2 after a federal appeals
court struck down the independent counsel law under which Deaver
was prosecuted.
   The Supreme Court's 7-1 decision last month upholding the
constitutionality of court-appointed independent counsels set the
stage for Deaver to be sentenced.
   During a brief hearing on the case, Stephen Braga, one of
Deaver's lawyers, told Jackson that the defense wanted to present
testimony from the head of an alcoholism rehabilitation clinic in
Havre de Grace, Md. where Deaver spent 30 days in 1985.
   Braga said Deaver's doctor at Georgetown University Hospital
would also be called to testify about the former presidential
aide's treatment for the disease earlier that year.
   The defense has contended in court papers that Deaver's memory
was impaired by his bout with alcoholism and therefore he wasn't
lying when he testified that he couldn't recall making certain
lobbying contacts.
   During the trial, Deaver's lawyers rested their case without
presenting witnesses, including doctors who treated him for
alcoholism.
   Several former employees of Michael K. Deaver & Associates, who
appeared as prosecution witnesses, testified during
cross-examination that Deaver suffered memory lapses and moodiness
which they later attributed to alcoholism.
   But the judge instructed jurors to disregard this testimony,
saying it was speculative and self-serving.
   Independent counsel Whitney North Seymour Jr. told the judge he
might call a medical expert to rebut testimony given by Deaver's
witnesses.
   Deaver's hospitalization for alcoholism in June, 1985 is a
period cited by the defense as a time when his memory was impaired
by alcoholic withdrawal and sedation.
   Several telephone calls Deaver made to government officials,
including one to then-Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole, took
place while the former White House aide was in the hospital.
   Deaver was found guilty of lying to the grand jury when he
testified: ``I don't recall any government contact I made'' on
behalf of Trans World Airlines.

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although he may lose the election, opposition
candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas appears to have secured a position as
the rallying point for the discontent with the party that has ruled
Mexico for 59 years.
   Whether he won the presidential election or not is still a
matter of heated debate. He says he did, the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, says he didn't.
   Privately, top PRI officials admit Cardenas won the Federal
District, the core of the sprawling Mexico City metropolitan area,
and three of Mexico's 31 states.
   Even those victories would be a stunning blow to the PRI, which
has won every presidential race since its founding in 1929 with at
least 70 percent of the vote, and never has lost a senate or
gubernatorial race.
   Cardenas claimed Monday he won 39 percent of the vote nationwide
to PRI candidate Carlos Salinas de Gortari's 35 percent.
   After a week's delay and opposition charges of fraud, the
government has only provided partial returns on the race for the
lower house of Congress.
   Figures released Tuesday by the PRI say Salinas had 53.59
percent of the votes counted. Cardenas was second with 26.08
percent, and Manuel J. Clouthier of the conservative National
Action Party followed with 16.04 percent.
   Even these figures, which the opposition disputes, would be an
astonishing feat for Cardenas, a candidate who in December started
to build his predominantly leftist coalition from a tiny base.
   His campaign was considered unlikely to shake the foundations of
power, and ruling politicians dismissed him as a candidate of
``nostalgia'' who was trading on his famous name.
   Through it all, the charismatic candidate never lost his
composure.
   Before hundreds of thousands of adoring supporters on the
campaign trail, in the steamy battle over vote fraud, at
middle-of-the-night news conferences in the days-long wait for the
returns, he was always calm, always reasonable.
   While Clouthier barreled down the campaign trail, blustering
about civil disobedience, Cardenas quietly counseled restraint and
spoke of using the force of law.
   Cardenas, 54, spent the day before the election in the central
state of Michoacan, where he once was the governing PRI's governor.
   He wasn't basking in the warmth accorded a favorite son. He was
mourning his old friend and political strategist, Francisco Xavier
Ovando, gunned down while on the way home from a political strategy
session.
   ``Xavier has fallen because he was fighting for Mexico to have a
true and authentic democracy,'' Cardenas said. ``He died because he
dreamed of a better, an independent and a free Mexico.''
   That moment was like a snapshot capturing the campaign and the
candidate.
   Cardenas was criticized for wanting to turn the clock back to
1910, when the Mexican Revolution started with the promise of a
better life, or to 1938, when his father, Mexico's revered 20th
century president, nationalized Mexico's oil and handed the young
republic its pride.
   But the Cardenas message wasn't about the nuts and bolts of
governing. It was visceral: He became a focal point of discontent
with a system that seemed calcified by nearly 60 years of
single-party rule.
   It was an ironic role for politician who once seemed to be the
ultimate product of a system his father, the late President Lazaro
Cardenas, helped create.
   Cardenas flourished in the PRI. He was its governor in Michoacan
and also a senator. The break started last year when Cardenas
seemed to sense the growing force of a cold wind of disfavor that
was about to blast the PRI.
   Calling his movement the Democratic Current, he told the party
to hold a presidential primary. The traditionalists in the party
refused and Cardenas defected, forming a left-of-center coalition,
the National Democratic Front.
   When he decided to run for president he campaigned virtually
without a critical forum _ television. TV in Mexico is
government-controlled or pro-government.
   But as he traveled the nation, he gathered larger and larger
crowds, winning the support of peasants, students, the struggling
middle class, intellectuals and oil workers.
   About a month before the election, he did what was considered
impossible _ he unified the left. The candidate of the Mexican
Socialist Party, the largest organized leftist force, dropped out
and endorsed Cardenas.
   No one knows if that political unity will survive once the
campaign passions cool. But Cardenas now appears to command a
popular force the governing party cannot ignore.

   Common Cause called Tuesday on the House
ethics committee to investigate reported ties by Rep. Bill
Chappell, D-Fla., chairman of the House Appropriations defense
subcommittee, to military contractors.
   The request came in a letter to the panel from Fred Wertheimer,
president of Common Cause, the self-described citizens' lobby.
   Wertheimer said ``serious questions'' were raised by news
reports that a company headed by two Washington representatives of
defense contractors, had intervened in a Florida foreclosure case
four years ago to relieve Chappell and his companies of debts
connected with an Ocala, Fla., health club.
   Wertheimer said the reports raise questions about whether
Chappell's actions appeared to violate House rules prohibiting a
conflict of interest.
   John Davidson, a spokesman for the ethics committee, declined to
say if the request had been received and when, or if, the panel
would act.
   Chappell has strongly denied any wrongdoing.
   He is one of five House members whose names have been linked to
the ongoing Pentagon bribery investigation. Federal investigators
have said no members of Congress are a target of the investigation.

<HEAD>Dukakis-Bentsen Ticket Recalls Kennedy-Johnson Match in 1960</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The last time a Massachusetts Democrat invited
a Texan to be his running mate, he didn't think the offer would be
accepted. And after Lyndon Johnson took him up on it, a shocked
John F. Kennedy asked his brother, ``Now what do we do?''
   That set Kennedy and his brother Robert, his campaign manager
and closest confidant in that 1960 election, to agonizing over how
to uninvite the proud, powerful and feared Senate majority leader.
   In the end, Kennedy of Massachusetts ran with Johnson of Texas
and narrowly won the 1960 election. Like every Democrat who won the
presidency since Texas became a state, he had the votes from the
Lone Star State.
   Twenty-eight years later, in a lengthy and more deliberative
process, Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, the putative
presidential nominee of the Democratic Party once again has turned
to a Texan, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, to be his vice president.
   ``Jack Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson beat that incumbent vice
president in 1960, and Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen are going to
beat them in 1988,'' Dukakis said as he made known his choice of a
running mate.
   Echoed Bentsen: ``The Massachusetts and the Texas axis was good
for the country and good for the Democratic Party in 1960 and it's
going to be a real winner in November of 1988.''
   Just as it did in 1960, Texas' rich harvest of electoral votes
and the advantage of having a southerner on the ticket played a
part in Dukakis' decision.
   John F. Kennedy, according to many accounts, gave no thought at
all during his campaign for the nomination as to who would run with
him. But after the delegates in the Los Angeles convention chose
him, Kennedy had only a few hours to make his pick. He told his
brother ``how terrible it was that he only had 24 hours to select a
vice president.''
   On returning to the rented apartment where he was staying,
Kennedy found ``the warmest and most cordial telegram of
congratulations'' from Johnson, according to Theodore White, in his
classic ``The Making of the President 1960.''
   ``Until that moment Kennedy had accepted at face value Johnson's
statement that he would never, never, never, trade his senatorial
vote for the vice presidential gavel,'' White wrote.
   Robert Kennedy said his brother told him he would offer the
nomination to Johnson first thing the next morning. John Kennedy
went to see the senator.
   ``I was in his room when he came back,'' Robert said in a 1965
interview with historian Arthur Schlesinger. ``And he said, `You
just won't believe it.'
   ``I said, `What?'
   ``And he said, `He wants it.'
   ``And I said, `Oh, my God!'
   ``He said, `Now what do we do?'''
   ``We spent the rest of the day _ and we both promised each other
that we'd never tell what happened ... alternating between thinking
it was good and thinking that it wasn't good that he'd offered him
the vice presidency and how he could get out of it,'' Robert
Kennedy said.
   ``One of the major factors ultimately that persuaded him that he
should take him was the fact that he would be so mean as majority
leader that it was much better having him as vice president, where
you could control him, than to have him as majority leader.
Particularly after you had offered him the job, then it would have
been disastrous to have that affront and withdraw it.''
   The two Kennedys decided to try and have Johnson take himself
out. Robert said he made two trips to Johnson's hotel room. On the
first, he said, Johnson's close friend, House Speaker Sam Rayburn,
was there and Kennedy only tried to feel Johnson out. But, like
everything else about that time, there are different versions of
that meeting.
   Phil Graham, the late publisher of the Washington Post who was
close to Johnson, recalled these events in a famous memorandum that
Dukakis recently studied during his search for a vice president.
   ``LBJ seemed about to jump out of his skin,'' Graham wrote of
the first Lyndon-Bobby meeting. ``He shouted at me that Bobby
Kennedy had just come in and told Rayburn and him that there was
such opposition and that Lyndon should withdraw for the sake of the
party.''
   On the second visit, Robert Kennedy said, he and Johnson were
alone. It was 2:30 p.m. on the last day of the convention.
   Robert said he conveyed two thoughts he'd worked out with his
brother. That there would be an unpleasant fight by labor leaders
if Johnson were on the ticket and that John Kennedy wanted him to
play an important role, running the party, and thereby build the
machinery he could use to run for president in 1968.
   ``I don't know whether it was just an act or anything,'' Kennedy
told Schlesinger. ``But he just shook, and tears came into his
eyes, and he said, `I want to be vice president, and if the
president will have me, I'll join with him in making a fight for
it.'
   ``I said, `well, that's fine. He wants you to be vice president
if you want to be vice president, we want you to know.'''
   At this point, too, there are conflicting accounts. Bobby
remembered returning to his brother who said he had been advised
that vaccilation on the vice president was disastrous and that he
would announce Johnson as the choice.
   James Rowe, a New Deal lawyer in Johnson's camp recalled that at
the end of the first meeting Graham called John Kennedy who told
him: ``Bobby's not up to date, I've already announced that Johnson
is the candidate.'

   Sixteen lawyers for people and companies in
the defense procurement probe are demanding that the Justice
Department launch an investigation into the sources of leaks to the
press.
   A department official said Tuesday it is ``too early'' to decide
whether to do so.
   ``We are writing to you to request that you commence an
investigation and take appropriate remedial action to deal with the
virtual flood of leaks by Department of Justice employees involved
in or privy to the details of the investigation,'' the attorneys
said in their unusual letter. One lawyer called the joint effort
``extraordinary.''
   The letter, dated July 8 and publicly released Tuesday, was
addressed to Michael E. Shaheen Jr., head of the Justice
Department's Office of Professional Responsibility. It complained
that ``frequency and substance of these `leaks' is ...
unprecedented.''
   Shaheen, who has responsibility for investigating ethics cases
involving Justice employees, refused to comment. John Russell, a
department spokesman, said it was ``too early to determine that we
will undertake an investigation.''
   Several of the defense counsels are former assistant U.S.
attorneys, obviously taking advantage of their knowledge of
internal Justice Department procedures to stop what they feel is a
case of government officials trying their case in the newspapers
and on television.
   Justice investigators have ``knowingly ensured dissemination of
confidential information and sensationalization of the entire
investigation'' by leaking information, the letter said.
   Such leaks create ``an environment in which our clients cannot
be dispassionately investigated...,'' they said.
   They suggested that Shaheen focus on possible violation of seven
statutes, regulations or rules barring Justice employees from
revealing unauthorized material. One law carries a fine of up to
$1,000 and imprisonment of a year for divulging certain material.
Other penalties can include a letter of censure or dismissal.
   Investigations into leaks are not unusual, Russell said. ``At
one time, we have anywhere from 10 to 15 leak investigations going
on,'' he said. Some of those include improper revelations of
classified material.
   Henry E. Hudson, the U.S. attorney in Alexandria, Va., who is
coordinating the massive probe, also has expressed concern about
leaks in the case, which was brought to public attention on June
14. FBI agents conducted surprise searches on more than three dozen
homes and offices in 12 states on that day.
   No one has been charged in the investigation of the Pentagon's
$150 billion-a-year procurement business. Indictments are not
expected until the end of the year, though grand jury subpoenas
have been issued for mid-July.
   The allegations are that defense consultants, often former
military officers, bribed Pentagon officials to obtain secret
information that gave their employers an edge in obtaining
contracts .
   Some of the information in the case has come from search
warrants used by the FBI in Alexandria, Va., and St. Louis, Mo., as
well as from one affidavit released in Dallas, Texas. The
affidavit, which contained information gathered by telephone
wiretaps, gave a detailed account of the investigators' case.
   Hudson has argued that the affidavits should remain under seal
because defense attorneys could take advantage of gaps in the
government's knowledge if the papers are open to public inspection.
Several news organizations around the country have filed lawsuits
challenging the sealing orders.
   The defense attorneys also complained that members of Congress
have ``quite predictably'' gone public with information provided by
Justice Department officials.
   Among the lawyers signing the letter are E. Lawrence Barcella
Jr., and Robert Plotkin, who represent defense consultant Melvyn
Paisley, and Michael Schatzow, whose client is Pentagon official
James Gaines. Paisley, a former top Navy official, has been
identified as a key player in the investigation; Gaines, a
long-time friend of Paisley's since their days at the Boeing Co.,
worked as a Navy procurement official.

<HEAD>Aloha Official Says Airline Found Corrosion At Least Twice Before</HEAD>

   Aloha Airlines inspectors confirmed Tuesday they
found evidence of corrosion in several of their Boeing 737
jetliners years before the April 28 accident in which the top of an
Aloha jet ripped off over Hawaii.
   In one case, a 7{-inch crack was found on a sister ship in the
same section of fuselage that ripped away in April, leaving a large
gaping hole above passengers' heads.
   Henry Arii, Aloha's vice president for quality control and
engineering, said the crack was discovered during a routine
inspection. Aloha officials blamed the crack on corrosion and said
it was promptly repaired.
   Arii's comments came during the first of four days of hearings
the National Transportation Safety Board is holding on the safety
and maintenance of aging jets.
   NTSB officials said the inquiry was not to assess blame in the
Aloha incident, but to collect more evidence about the accident, in
which 61 of 94 people aboard were hurt and one flight attendant was
swept to her death before the damaged craft landed on Maui.
   Although one of the two engines had quit, the pilot and co-pilot
struggled to control the crippled jet and managed to land it safely
13 minutes later.
   Representatives of The Boeing Co., the Federal Aviation
Administration and other industry groups also are scheduled to
testify.
   In documents released last month by the NTSB, Boeing officials
warned Aloha months before the accident to make a thorough
structural inspection of the plane involved in the accident and of
three other aging 737s.
   Besides the plane found to have the 7{-inch crack, Arii
testified that Aloha inspectors found some bulges and corrosion in
the skin over fuselage joints on a third Boeing 737 flown by the
airline.
   Thomas Haueter, an NTSB aerospace engineer, asked whether Aloha
inspectors considered these discoveries, which came over the course
of several years, significant and a reason to adjust their
inspection of the jets.
   ``I can't recollect,'' replied Arii, who did recall the airline
using more corrosion inhibitors on the planes during routine
maintenance checks.
   The 7{-inch crack found in 1984 ``must have been viewed as an
isolated incident by the airline,'' Arii said in response to a
question by board of inquiry Chairman John K. Lauber.
   Haueter shot back that the crack ``wasn't an isolated incident
if you looked at the service reports.''
   Analyses by NTSB engineers found some evidence of corrosion,
``disbonding'' and bulging skin on the surface of the April 28
accident plane where pieces of the fuselage were joined together.
   That plane had made 89,690 landings, the second highest of any
Boeing 737 in service. The only plane with more landings, 90,051,
also was being flown by Aloha. It was taken out of service after
the accident.

   Two American helicopters answering a call
for help from a tanker exchanged fire with a pair of Iranian
speedboats Tuesday in the northern Persian Gulf, U.S. military
officials reported.
   They said the helicopters were not damaged and it was not known
whether rockets fired by the choppers hit the boats. The sources,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the shooting occurred at
about 7 p.m.
   The helicopters were not identified by type, but descriptions of
the incident indicate they were two of the U.S. Army's specially
equipped scout aircraft, based on some U.S. warships in the gulf.
   Navy officials refuse to discuss the helicopters or even confirm
their presence in the gulf, although the Pentagon disclosed that
information last year. It was the second time in less than two
weeks that U.S. forces went to the aid of a non-U.S. flag vessel
under fire by Iranians.
   The frigate Elmer Montgomery aided a Danish tanker in the
southern gulf July 2, driving its attackers away. No casualties
were reported in that encounter, which occurred the day before the
U.S. missile cruiser Vincennes shot down an Iranian jetliner over
the Strait of Hormuz. Pentagon officials say the captain thought it
was an Iranian F-14 fighter.
   Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said in Washington that in
Tuesday's attack the Iranian boats had been shooting at the
81,282-ton Universal Monarch, which broadcast a distress alert
saying it ``was being attacked and was on fire.''
   Two helicopters from the missile frigate USS Nicholas ``were
sent out to investigate the ship's Mayday call,'' Howard said.
``They were fired on by two small boats that we assume were
Iranian. They fired rockets at those small boats.''
   ``The military helicopters returned fire with rockets, but we do
not yet have any word if there was any damage to the Iranian
boats,'' he said. ``The helicopters were not hit by the Iranian
fire.''
   The military officials in Bahrain, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the Nicholas was on a patrol in the northern gulf
and the confrontation occurred about 15 miles west of Farsi island.
   Iran's Revolutionary Guards use as a speedboat base for attacks
on neutral shipping in the 8-year-old war with Iraq.
   Shipping executives said the Universal Monarch, which is Hong
Kong-owned and registered in Panama, was sailing empty to pick up
cargo from the Khafji fields, owned jointly by Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait.
   The gunboats attacked the tanker with rocket grenades and set it
afire, the American officials said. The Nicholas, a 3,600-ton
frigate that arrived in the gulf about three weeks ago, was about
six miles away.
   Crewmen put out a fire in the tanker's engine room and there
were no casualties, said the shipping executives, who spoke on
condition their names not be used.
   Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit in London said the vessel was
flooding, but the shipping executives said it was not serious. A
U.S. official said the Nicholas offered ``humanitarian
assistance,'' but none was required.
   Under expanded ``rules of engagement'' in effect since May 3,
U.S. warships in the gulf have been permitted to intervene with
force to stop attacks on neutral shipping in international waters,
provided they are not carrying war-related materials and asked for
assistance.
   Iranian gunboats had steered clear of the U.S. ships, attacking
in locations too far away for the Americans to intervene. The July
2 encounter involving the Elmer Montgomery was the first
confrontation between U.S. and Iranian forces since the policy was
broadened.
   Another on the next day, involving the Montgomery and the
Vincennes, led indirectly to the jetliner disaster. U.S. officials
said that clash began when a helicopter from the Vincennes was
fired on by Iranian speedboats in the Strait of Homruz.
   In a skirmish that followed, the Vincennes and the Elmer
Montgomery sank two boats and damaged one just before the Iran Air
Airbus took off from Bandar Abbas for Dubai with 290 people aboard.
   The attack on the Universal Monarch was the second in a week by
Iran's gunboats, and apparently responded to two Iraqi raids on
Iranian tankers Thursday, the shipping executives said.
   Elsewhere in the war, Iraq claimed its forces achieved their
fourth major battlefield victory in three months Tuesday by driving
Iranian troops out of their last stronghold in southern Iraq.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency claimed the Iraqis used
chemical weapons, killing 25 soldiers and wounding more than 3,600.
Iraq, which has acknowledged using such weapons in the past, did
not respond.

   Jenny Nicholson, who says she believed
Union County commissioners were serious when they named her
official astrologer, quit Tuesday because of the commotion her
position created.
   ``I think that maybe they wanted to make fun of me and make me
look foolish,'' Ms. Nicholson said from her home in La Grande.
``I've worked 20 years doing what I'm doing. I'm not foolish. I'm
very much a common-sense person.
   ``This is a Pisces town, two fish swimming in opposite
directions,'' she said of the northeastern Oregon community. ``We
don't need divisions here. We need to come together. I have no wish
to upset anyone here. I love my town.''
   Ms. Nicholson said she mailed the county commission a letter
Monday informing them she was quitting the non-paying post.
   Despite the letter, the commission voted 3-0 Tuesday to rescind
the appointment.
   The incident began when Ms. Nicholson went to the newspaper in
La Grande, a timber and farming community of about 12,000, to tell
them the stars were in a great position for the county to obtain
federal and state grants.
   County commissioners read the article and, without Ms.
Nicholson's knowledge, voted last week to appoint her to help find
the right time to make their applications.
   At the time, County Judge John Howard, who heads the commission,
said, ``What the heck, if the Reagan administration is rumored as
using astrology, I guess we can try it on the local level as well.''
   Howard said he was surprised by the publicity.
   ``I viewed it as tongue-in-cheek,'' he said. ``It was just kind
of a gesture to lighten things up and create some conversation.
   Ms. Nicholson, 38, who reads palms and develops astrological
charts for a living, said she has plenty of business, thanks to the
unexpected publicity.
   She said she also would like to do astrological charts for
communities and states as a public service.
   She threw in her assessment of Oregon.
   ``Oregon is an Aquarius state and has a peculiar chart,'' she
said. ``Ours is not an easy destiny. We are trend setters for the
nation. People will laugh at us, make fun of us and for 50 years
they'll be following our trends.''
   Next spring, she said, the stars will be favorable for the state
improving its education system.
   The nation, however, is headed for tougher times, she said.
   ``We've got major, hairy, hairy aspects coming up beginning in
March of 1989.''

   ``I'm a fellow born on a dirt road in a
cottage down in South Texas,'' Lloyd Bentsen said Tuesday.
   But he doesn't look it. Six feet one or two, trim, silver-haired
and adroit, he looks more like Texas wealth, Texas oil and Texas
slick than a fellow from a dirt-road cottage down on a farm.
   Michael Dukakis' choice for vice president is a quiet man,
impeccably tailored and his shoes always shined. He has been
married for 44 years to Beryl Ann ``B.A.'' Bentsen, once a
high-fashion model whose face appeared in Vogue, Glamour and
Mademoiselle magazines.
   An attorney and World War II pilot who flew bombers over the
Third Reich, Bentsen is described as shrewd and competitive,
fighting effectively to protect the favorable tax status of the
Texas oil industry and against the trade deficit.
   Dukakis, introducing Bentsen Tuesday, said the Texan had ``hit a
grand slam home run'' in the Senate this session _ his committee
producing ``a thoughtful, responsible trade bill,'' a welfare
revision bill and a bill requiring firms to give workers 60 days
notice before closing a plants.
   Bentsen appeals with equal ease to the men of power in corporate
boardrooms and the farm workers of his native Rio Grande Valley of
Texas. He speaks Spanish as fluently as English.
   He is a conservative, a Protestant, a Washington insider.
   Bentsen, 67, describes himself as one ``who has always been able
to build a consensus'' and as proof points to legislation coming
out of the Senate Finance Committee with votes of 18-2 and 19-1.
   ``I think the first impression of Sen. Bentsen is he understands
how you handle the halls of power, the board rooms as well as the
cloakrooms of America,'' said Rep. Ron Coleman, D-Texas. ``He knows
how to get things done. The good thing also is that he has the
compassion for the disadvantaged.''
   His father, Lloyd Millard Bentsen Sr., a South Dakota native, a
motorcycle racer and one-time hard-drinker, arrived in Texas with
$5 in his pockets and built a financial dynasty in the
citrus-bearing lands of far South Texas.
   Bentsen was elected to Congress in 1948 at age 27. Early in his
House career, he cast a vote that was seen as an act of courage: He
was only one of two Texas representatives who voted to repeal the
poll tax.
   In the House, he once suggested that then-President Dwight
Eisenhower threaten North Korea with nuclear bombs unless they
withdraw their forces north of the 38th parallel.
   After six years in the House, in the late 1940s and 1950s,
Bentsen returned to Texas and to make a fortune in Houston. With
his father's help, he founded Lincoln Consolidated, an insurance
holding company which controlled stock worth hundreds of millions
of dollars.
   In 1970, he decided to run for the Senate. He successfully
challenged the Democratic incumbent, Sen. Ralph Yarborough, who was
something of a populist and represented the liberal wing of the
Democratic Party. Bentsen accused Yarborough of supporting the
violence which occurred during anti-Vietnam War demonstrations at
the 1968 Democratic presidential convention. To make his point, he
ran commercials replaying the street warfare of Chicago.
   In the general election, he defeated George Bush, then a Houston
congressman, now the certain Republican presidential nominee.
   Bentsen says one of his greatest strengths has been an ``across
the board spectrum of support'' with Mexican-Americans as the base.
But in his race against Bush, Bentsen lost most of the minority
voters in Texas, winning big in rural areas and among blue-collar
Democrats.
   ``He is certainly the mind behind a tremendously effective
political machine in Texas _ not a party operation but a Bentsen
operation. He is the man that pulls the people together and makes
it run,'' said a Capitol Hill Republican Tuesday, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Bentsen is a tremendous fund-raiser, outdistancing all other
candidates for Congress so far this year, according to Federal
Election Commission reports. The FEC said Bentsen had raised over
$5 million in the 15 months between Jan. 1, 1987, and the end of
March 1988. He also took in more political action committee money
than any other candidate, over $1.46 million.
   He admitted he had made a ``doozy'' of a mistake early last year
when he invited Washington lobbyists to pay $10,000 for the
privilege of joining him for breakfast once a month.
   After deciding such contributions ``would reflect on my
integrity'' _ and reflecting in the glow of intense publicity _
Bentsen disbanded his ``Chairman's Council'' after only one session
and returned the money to an estimated 40 lobbyists who had looked
with pleasure at the prospect of breakfasting with the chairman of
the Senate committee that handles taxes.
   Yet Bentsen has a long-standing policy of not accepting
honoraria for speaking engagements and will rarely accept a gift.
   During his years in the Senate, Bentsen gradually moderated his
views, often voting for a broader federal role on social issues and
gradually opposing the Vietnam War.
   ``We have fulfilled our commitment,'' Bentsen said in 1971,
three years before last U.S. combat troops left.
   On government's role, Bentsen says: ``I think it's terribly
important that we invest in children and young people and do the
utmost we can to make sure they are born with sound minds and
bodies and given a good start in life.
   ``We have two handicapped grandchildren of our own,'' he says,
``and that's part of the motivation... You relate to those kinds of
concerns and problems. That's why I pushed so hard for prenatal and
neonatal health care.''
   He was also behind trade legislation for years, even when few
others cared about the issue.
   ``Well, you can't be a nation that is spending 104 percent of
what you produce and that's what we've been doing and you have to
turn that around, increase production of our country; that in turn
raises the standing of living for your country,'' he says. ``That's
why I pushed hard.''

<HEAD>Maltese Leader Reaches Out To West</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Eddie Fenech Adami of Malta
offered on Tuesday to lead his Mediterranean island nation back
into the mainstream of West European traditions, but not as ``a
tool of war.''
   He also appealed for foreign investment, saying it was essential
for the survival of the Mediterranean nation. ``We do not feel
investment is a dirty word,'' Fenech Adami said in a speech at the
American Enterprise Institute, a private research group.
   He said investors would get ``a privileged welcome,'' but did
not specify the steps Malta was prepared to take to attract foreign
capital.
   Malta emerged from British rule in 1964 and sought to retain its
military ties with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It had
been a British base during World War II.
   But NATO declined to give Malta ``observer'' status in the
Western alliance. Under former Prime Minister Don Mintoff the
country veered away from the West and established military ties
with Libya, which were disavowed after Fenech Adami's election last
year.
   The Maltese leader said economic ties with Libya would be
retained as part of a general policy of neutrality. But, he said,
``we are not ideologically neutral where freedom and human rights
are concerned.''
   Malta's constitution prohibits foreign bases on Maltese soil.
``Malta is no longer offering itself as a tool of war but is
opening its arms wide to those with a spirit of enterprise,''
Fenech Adami said.
   The Maltese leader arrived Sunday for a week of talks with
Reagan administration officials. It is the first visit to
Washington by a leader of the country in 25 years. On Wednesday,
Fenech Adami sees President Reagan at the White House.

   U.S. and Vietnamese officials will meet
Thursday and Friday in Hanoi to plan the move to the United States
of thousands of Vietnamese detained after the Indochina War because
of their American connections, it was announced Tuesday.
   The two governments have agreed to the talks ``to discuss the
resettlement in the United States of Vietnamese re-education camp
detainees who wish to come,'' State Department spokeswoman Phyllis
Oakley told reporters.
   ``The great majority of current and former re-education camp
detainees were incarcerated because of their close association with
the United States and as allies during the war,'' Mrs. Oakley told
reporters. ``For this compelling humanitarian reason, we have
repeatedly affirmed our strong humanitarian desire to resettle
those who wish in the United States as soon as possible.''
   Robert L. Sunseth, senior deputy assistant secretary of state
for refugee programs, will head the U.S. delegation to Hanoi, she
said.
   The State Department has estimated that 900,000 former employees
of the U.S. government in South Vietnam and officials of the
defeated Saigon government were sent to political re-education
camps after the fall of Saigon and unification of the country in
1975.
   Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach told reporters a
month ago at U.N. headquarters in New York the re-education camp
migrants will be allowed to depart on a guarantee that they do not
engage in activities hostile to the Hanoi government. He predicted
a flow of tens of thousands.
   U.S. officials also have said the United States plans to admit
29,500 people this year from the continuing flow of refugees
managing to flee Vietnam by small boat to nearby Southeast Asian
countries.

   Michael Dukakis anointed Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas as his vice
presidential running mate on Tuesday, signaling a Democratic drive
to reclaim a portion of the South in the fall election against
George Bush. Dukakis described the decision as his ``first
presidential act.''
   ``We're going to fight for every state in the Union and we're
going all out to win,'' the 67-year-old Bentsen said in his public
debut as Dukakis' political partner. Both men said they were
following the path to victory forged by another Massachusetts-Texas
team, John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, in 1960.
   Jesse Jackson, passed over for the job he openly sought, said he
was ``too controlled...and too mature to be angry.'' He said his
name would be placed in nomination for president against Dukakis
next Wednesday, but added, ``I no doubt will support the ticket
that the convention elects next week.''
   There was no immediate reaction from Bush, although he said in a
Boston Globe interview published earlier in the day that Bentsen
``doesn't worry me'' despite the Democrat's victory in a 1970
head-to-head Senate race. Senate GOP leader Bob Dole said Dukakis
``couldn't have picked a better man.''
   In Atlanta, party officials said construction work would be
finished on the Omni convention hall ahead of schedule, and a few
days before thousands of delegates begin streaming into the
convention city over the weekend.
   Dukakis presented Bentsen in ceremony televised live from
swletering Faneuil Hall in Boston. A large crowd of supporters
stood outside in the afternoon sunshine, waiting for a glimpse of
the Democratic ticket for 1988.
   ``We go to Atlanta and we begin the road to victory,'' Dukakis
said. His choice of Bentsen must be ratified by the delegates to
the convention that begins on Monday, and there is no doubt he will
have his way, regardless of whether Jackson or his delegates decide
to seek a symbolic showdown.
   One Jackson supporter in Congress, Rep. John Conyers of
Michigan, said the selection ``disappointed and shocked'' him. ``It
may be that we're back in the Mondale-Carter syndrome of trying to
make the Democratic Party only slightly less conservative than the
Republican party,'' he said.
   But the two ticket mates said they were on the road to the White
House.
   Said Bentsen:
   ``The Massachusetts and the Texas axis was good for the country
and good for the Democratic Party in 1960 and it's gonna be a real
winner in 1988.''
   Dukakis said ``selecting a running mate is probably the first
presidential act, if I could use those words, that I will do.'' In
choosing Bentsen, he hoped the party's liberal wing would go along.
   Bentsen, 67, is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and a
consummate party insider. He is a moderate who differs with Dukakis
on some issues, most prominently perhaps in his support for aid to
the Nicaraguan Contras.
   Despite Bush's professed lack of concern, Republican strategists
said that in turning to Bentsen, Dukakis had transformed one of
Bush's strongest states into an autumn battleground. Texas has 29
electoral votes, more than any state except California and New
York, and no Democrat has been elected president this century
without carrying it.
   Bush's campaign manager, Lee Atwater, said he was unconcerned.
He said Democrats have ``thrown away the vice presidential
selection'' because they cannot wrest Texas away from the
Republicans. ``People in Texas want a president, not a vice
president. And George Bush is the man they want,'' he said.
   Among those considered and then passed over for the vice
presidential slot were Jackson, Sens. John Glenn of Ohio; Albert
Gore Jr. of Tennessee, Bob Graham of Texas and Reps. Richard
Gephardt of Missouri and Lee Hamilton of Missouri. Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey and Sam Nunn of Georgia told Dukakis they did
not want to be considered.
   Bentsen is a prodigious fundraiser and owner of a moderate to
conservative voting record after nearly a quarter century in the
House and Senate.
   The selection was reminiscent of the 1960 campaign, when another
son of Massachusetts _ John F. Kennedy _ turned to Texan Lyndon
Johnson in a drive for votes in the South. Johnson helped the
ticket win Texas and other states that year, and Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy provided an echo of that past campaign after hearing of
Bentsen's selection.
   ``The Massachusetts-Texas combination got this country moving
again in 1960 _ and it will do the same for the nation in 1988,''
said the senator in a statement.
   Much of the Democratic establishment moved to embrace Bentsen.
``Democratic prospects in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana will be
boosted immediately, and when the American people get to know Lloyd
Bentsen it will strengthen the ticket everywhere,'' said Sen. Paul
Simon, of Illinois, a liberal and former primary rival of Dukakis.
   John White, a former Democratic national chairman who has been
advising Jackson, said he was ``excited'' about the choice of
Bentsen and said it would ``make Texas a hell of a battlefield.''
   Asked if he would convince Jackson about the merits of Bentsen,
White replied, ``Jesse's a very quick study. I'm not worried about
that.''
   At his news conference, an obviously subdued Jackson said he
first learned of Bentsen's selection from a reporter, but Dukakis
called him a short while later and told him on the telephone. He
said he would press his case for the nomination as well as for
changes in the barebones platform drafted by Dukakis' forces.
   There was no hint of whether Jackson or his 1,100 delegates
would challenge the nomination at the Democratic National
Convention next week.
   Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., who is national co-chairwoman of
Bush's presidential campaign, tried to dampen the historical
connection.
   ``I'm sure we're going to hear 1960 ad nauseum,'' she said.
``There's a slight difference, of course. He (Bentsen) was not
selected by his peers to be in leadership (as Lyndon Johnson, the
Senate majority leader, had been); nor is Dukaks John Kennedy.''
   Public polls taken recently indicate that Bentsen is little
known nationally, but could give Dukakis an enormous boost in the
race for Texas. One survey shows Bush routing Dukakis by more than
20 percentage points in the Lone Star State _ with the margin
dwindling to four percentage points if Bentsen were placed on the
ticket.
   The selection of Bentsen followed a six-week search for a
partner for the fall campaign that was focused almost exclusively
on members of Congress from the South and Midwest. ``It's kind of
fun, this business of running for the presidency,'' said Dukakis as
he arrived at his statehouse office a few hours before the
mid-afternoon announcement.
   For the methodical and serious Dukakis, that sounded like a
whoop of joy that his long search was over _ and that his secret
had held.
   Bush campaigned during the day at an NAACP convention in
Washington, where he promised to have a ``positive civil rights
agenda'' if he succeeds President Reagan in office.
   ``I guarantee you I will be personally involved in protecting
the civil rights of all Americans,'' Bush said to loud applause
from one of the nation's most prominent civil rights groups.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis tapped Sen. Lloyd Bentsen
as his running mate Tuesday, setting up a home-state challenge to
Bentsen's fellow Texan George Bush and stirring memories of the
Massachusetts-Texas connection that won the White House in 1960.
   ``The parallels between 1960 and 1988 are very close indeed,''
Dukakis told a cheering crowd of supporters packed into the steamy
hall. ``Then we had had eight rather amiable but sleepy years of
Republicans in the White House. We had a country that was ready for
change.
   Dukakis noted that the Republicans nominated an incumbent vice
president, Richard Nixon, in 1960, while the Democrats chose Sen.
John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Kennedy in turn tapped Sen.
Lyndon Johnson of Texas.
   ``Jack Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson beat that incumbent vice
president in 1960, and Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen are going to
beat them in 1988,'' Dukakis said.
   Bentsen, cheered by the partisan crowd as he stepped to the
microphone, echoed Dukakis, saying, ``The Massachusetts and the
Texas axis was good for the country and good for the Democratic
Party in 1960 and it's going to be a real winner in November of
1988.''
   Both men were accompanied by their wives, Kitty Dukakis and
Beryl Bentsen. Mrs. Dukakis appeared for the first time in public
without her neck brace since her spinal surgery in early June, and
Dukakis smiled at her and said, ``Doesn't my bride look fantastic
without that collar on.''
   The four joined arms and posed for pictures on the stage in
historic Faneuil Hall, a structure that was built in 1742 and
earned the nickname ``The Cradle of Liberty'' as a forum for
revolutionaries in colonial America.
   Dukakis said Bentsen brought to the Democratic ticket ``years of
experience and a deep commitment to civil rights ... that goes way
back to the 1940s.'' Dukakis said Bentsen, the chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee, stood for good jobs at good wages _ a
central theme of his campaign.
   Bentsen said, ``The fact that he's chosen a senator from Texas,
a senator from the South, shows that we're going to fight for every
state in the Union and we're going all out to win.'' He said
Dukakis, a son of Greek immigrants, was ``living out his parents'
dream but wants that dream a reality for all Americans.''
   From Faneuil Hall, Dukakis took Bentsen to the Statehouse, where
they spoke briefly to both chambers of the Massachusetts
Legislature. They then went to a gathering, in Boston, of state
Democratic chairmen from across the country.
   Dukakis, in selecting Bentsen, served notice he would not
concede Texas and its 29 electoral votes to Bush, who calls the
state his home. Dukakis also added Washington experience and
philosophical and geographical balance to the Democratic ticket.
   The Massachusetts governor made the choice late Monday at a
meeting with Paul Brountas, his longtime confidant, and campaign
manager Susan Estrich.
   He called Bentsen Tuesday morning and, after the senator agreed
to join the ticket, went to his Statehouse office to telephone the
six other men who were being considered for the vice presidential
nomination, said sources who spoke to The Associated Press on the
condition they not be identified by name.
   Still, Jesse Jackson, whose actions could be critical to
Democratic hopes for a harmonious convention, told reporters he
knew nothing of the choice until they told him it was being
reported _ several hours before Dukakis announced it in Boston.
   He said Dukakis later phoned him but they did not have a lengthy
discussion. Asked if he was angry about being passed over, Jackson
replied: ``No, I'm too controlled, I'm too clear, I'm too mature to
be angry.'' He called the selection of Bentsen ``a strategic move.''
   Bentsen already has done what Dukakis hopes to do in the fall _
defeat Bush. Bentsen's win came in a 1970 run for the Senate seat
he now holds.
   Bush recently said that Bentsen ``doesn't worry me'' and
predicted he would carry Texas in November even if Bentsen was
Dukakis' running mate.
   Bentsen, an elegantly tailored, silver-haired patrician, is the
scion of a wealthy landed family from the Rio Grande Valley and a
leading member of the Senate Democratic establishment.
   The senator, like Dukakis, has been a politician most of his
adult life, winning election to the U.S. House in 1948 at the age
of 27. But he is no Dukakis clone, having supported aid for
Nicaragua's Contra rebels, which Dukakis has decried as a ``failed
and illegal policy.''
   Bentsen is up for re-election to his Senate seat in November,
and if he chooses, could run for both offices at once _ a precedent
set by Johnson in 1960.
   Bentsen has been a central figure in Congress' battle with
President Reagan over trade legislation _ an issue Democrats plan
to play heavily in this fall's campaign. His committee also
oversees tax legislation and the welfare reform bill currently
before a House-Senate conference committee.
   Bentsen mounted a 1976 run for the Democratic presidential
nomination but excited little interest. In 1984, he was on
Democratic nominee Walter Mondale's list of possible running mates.
   He created a brief furor in February 1987 when it was revealed
that he had asked lobbyists to pay $10,000 apiece to join him for
breakfast once a month. The breakfast club, called the ``Chairman's
Council,'' held one meeting and was quickly disbanded. Bentsen
returned the money collected from an estimated 40 lobbyists.

   Fire gutted half a small apartment building early
Tuesday, killing seven people, including three children, officials
said.
   The Fire Department was treating the blaze, the city's deadliest
this year, as arson although authorities had not determined the
cause, spokesman Scott LaGreca said.
   Firefighters confronted a wall of flames at the building, which
was home to about 30 people, officials said.
   ``It was just pure orange _ a full flame,'' firefighter Al Zaja
said. ``The people had no chance of getting out.''
   ``You could see the blaze for five or six blocks,'' said David
Collins, 23, a motorists who stopped to help evacuate residents.
   Collins said he kicked in two doors and carried a man from the
rear, second-floor apartment, but was unable to rescue the others.
   ``I heard children hollering on the third floor,'' he said. ``I
went to go up, but the blaze started getting really heavy, and I
started choking so I ran out.''
   Most of the residents were sleeping when the fire broke out at
about 12:30 a.m., fire officials said. The blaze was out by 2 a.m.,
they said.
   The victims were found on the floor and couches of the
second-and third-floor rear units of the three-story building,
firefighter Pat Blake said.
   Three children, ages 10, 12 and 13, were among the victims, said
fire department spokesman Tom Sheppard.
   ``Everybody was just trying to get everybody else out, but the
fire spread too quick,'' said Kent Daniels, 23, who lived in the
rear apartment on the first floor. Daniels' aunt and cousin died in
the fire, he said.
   Stephen Mallory, 16, said his grandparents and three of their
grandchildren died in the third-floor apartment. Mallory wasn't in
the building at the time.
   Firefighters found an empty gasoline can behind the house, but
police investigators don't know if it was used to set the blaze,
police Sgt. Darryl Collins said.
   The sergeant said the building had smoke detectors but it wasn't
clear if they were functioning.

<HEAD>Jailed Amish Man Exempted From Wearing Orange Jump Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRESTON, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Amish man jailed for refusing to
display an orange slow-moving-vehicle sign on his horse-drawn buggy
was exempted from wearing the orange jump suit normally worn by
inmates.
   Gideon Hershberger, 62, served seven days in the Fillmore County
Jail for contempt of court and was released Tuesday.
   Hershberger and other Amish contend that displaying the orange
signs is against their religion.
   ``I'd say it's the most I can do,'' he said. ``I don't want to
be stubborn, but I will continue without the sign. What else can I
do?''
   County Sheriff Don Gudmundson allowed Hershberger to wear his
blue denim pants, deep blue cotton shirt and navy blue suspenders.
   District Court Judge Margaret Shaw Johnson ruled earlier this
month that public safety overrides the Amish resistance to the
orange triangle.
   ``Religion is not a defense in this case,'' she said.
   Hershberger said the Amish prefer to trust God over worldly
symbols, and they want to live the way their forefathers lived.
   Some Amish use orange triangles. But others use a black triangle
with a white outline and some of the older, more conservative
members like Hershberger use no sign at all. They prefer to outline
their buggies with white reflective tape.
   Hershberger spent his jail time working in a woodworking shop
and reading.
   Gudmundson is sympathetic to Hershberger and other Amish
violators.
   ``They say they don't want to create problems for me or the
state, which they are,'' he said. ``But this is something I admire
them for, even though I can't agree with it.''

   Lee Atwater, Republican George Bush's campaign
manager, said Tuesday that Democrats have ``thrown away the vice
presidential selection'' with Michael Dukakis' choice of Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen as his running mate.
   ``After all is said and done, they're not going to win Texas,''
Atwater said in an interview. ``People in Texas want a president,
not a vice president. And George Bush is the man they want.''
   Bush, en route to baseball's All-Star game in Cincinnati, told
reporters, ``That's interesting. That's what I think about it,''
when asked about the Bentsen selection.
   Atwater said he was delighted with the choice of Bentsen, saying
``If I were selecting the nominee, I couldn't have done better
myself.''
   He claimed that nearly any of the other prominent Democrats
mentioned as a possible vice president, including Sens. John Glenn
of Ohio and Albert Gore of Tennessee as well as Jesse Jackson,
would have posed a greater challenge to the GOP ticket this fall.
   ``The Democrats have thrown away the vice presidential selection
as far as I'm concerned ... He will help some in Texas, but only
enough to get them (Democrats) to spend a whole bunch of time and
money down there that they're going to end up squandering away.''
   Bush's campaign manager said that the selection of Bentsen may
give Democrats a surge in the polls in Texas, ``but that will
settle down and after all is said and done, George Bush is going to
win Texas.''
   He dismissed comparisons to the 1960 Democratic ticket that also
had a Massachusetts-Texas breakdown with President John F. Kennedy
and Lyndon B. Johnson.
   ``If it was like 1960, then we'll win handily, because the South
in 1960 was solidly for Nixon. Now the South is going to be solidly
for Bush,'' Atwater said.
   ``Democrats will be saying that ad nauseam,'' Rep. Lynn Martin,
R-Ill., national co-chairwoman of the Bush campaign, said in
reference to the comparison of the two tickets.
   ``But it's a little different running for president and vice
president than running for the Senate. We're talking about
different sets of experiences. His (Bentsen's) experience has been
in finance. You don't think of him as being strong either in terms
of social issues or in terms of foreign policy, frankly,'' Mrs.
Martin sid.
   Bentsen defeated Bush in a 1970 Senate race, but Bush aides
insisted that fact would not trouble the certain 1988 GOP
presidential nominee.
   Bush himself did not mention the selection of Bentsen in a
morning speech to a convention of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.
   Bush had said he wanted to wait to see whom the Democrats would
pick for the No. 2 spot on their ticket before giving thought to a
running mate. Atwater said Bush still intends to delay his own
choice of a running mate until the Republican National Convention
in August.
   But, Mrs. Martin said, the selection of Bentsen does not make
much difference in terms of the dynamics for the GOP ticket.
   ``The one thing it does is it allows George Bush the same
freedom he had yesterday. I don't think the selection of Bentsen,
without diminishing the senator at all, is one that says now Bush
has to do x, y or z,'' she said.
   Mrs. Martin said that Bentsen was not that well known outside
Washington or Texas, other than being identified as ``kind of big
oil ... and breakfasts, breakfasts at Tiffany's sort-of-thing,'' a
reference to Bentsen's short-lived effort to organize breakfasts
with lobbyists who were to pay $10,000 each.
   ``I still think George Bush will carry Texas,'' Mrs. Martin
said. ``You never underestimate an opponent. On the other hand, I
suspect no one's in raging fear either.''

<HEAD>Dick Gregory to Help Illinois Man Lose Weight</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Dick Gregory appeared Tuesday with his latest
recruit, a 701-pound man from Illinois who is determined to become
``a normal person again.''
   ``America is the most obese nation in the world,'' Gregory said
at a news conference. ``It is well established as the No. 1
nutrition-related problem in our nation.''
   Gregory, during a brief stopover at Lambert Airport, described
the regimen he will prescribe for Steve Nellis, of Hurst, Ill., for
the next two years. It will include a diet of raw fruits and
vegetables.
   From St. Louis, the two men flew to New Jersey, where Nellis
will undergo a medical evaluation. Then he will fly to another
location, possibly in Florida, for the major portion of his
weight-loss program, which could last up to two years.
   Nellis, a former school bus driver, said his weight, although
well above normal since early childhood, was only 300 pounds when
he married his wife 10 years ago.
   ``I want to be able to go to work,'' Nellis said of his goal to
lose 500 pounds. ``I want to be able to be a better husband to my
wife and just to be a normal person.''
   More than a dozen people whose weight reductions have been
supervised by Gregory in recent years include Walter Hudson, a
Hempstead, N.Y., man whose case received wide attention last fall.
   Gregory came to Hudson's aid when Hudson, who weighed 1,200
pounds, became wedged in the door of his home. Hudson showed steady
improvement under the routine that Gregory supervised but was
forced to drop out because of his fear of leaving his home to go to
a center.
   ``Ten to 13 percent of our children are overweight, and we lose
more people to obesity-related problems than we do to drugs,'' he
said. ``We need a national goal of weight management for life.''

<TEXT>
   Legislators of a mountain enclave that has been
involved in an ethnic tug-of-war for months voted Tuesday to secede
from Azerbaijan and join Armenia _ a dramatic first in Soviet
politics, but probably futile.
   The legislature of Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly Armenian
enclave in Azerbaijan, was unanimous except for one abstention in
the decision to secede and rename the area the Artsakh Autonomous
Region of Armenia, radio reporters in the territory reported.
   About 160,000 people live in Nagorno-Karabakh and three-quarters
are ethnic Armenians.
   Dissident historian Roy Medvedev said the legislative action
appears to have little chance of success.
   ``It's unconstitutional,'' he said. ``It cannot be considered
legal.''
   Never before in Soviet history has a region's legislature voted
to withdraw from the republic of which it is a part, he said.
   The decision defies central authorities all the way up to
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and tests Kremlin tolerance of assertions of
rights by the country's more than 100 national groups. Gorbachev
has encouraged citizens to speak out under his policy of glasnost,
or openness.
   The Soviet constitution gives citizens the right to
self-determination, but also requires that a republic consent to
any change in its boundaries.
   Nagorno-Karabakh is an autonomous region of Azerbaijan, which is
Soviet Armenia's neighbor in the Caucasus.
   Its legislature asked Feb. 20 that the Azerbaijani and Armenian
governments approve the transfer to Armenia. The Armenians agreed
June 15 but Azerbaijan's legislature rejected the request two days
later.
   Strikes and street rallies have disrupted Stepanakert, the
territorial capital, for weeks.
   A statement by the legislature, read over the telephone by
reporters for the Stepanakert radio station, said: ``The Soviet of
People's Deputies of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region
declares its secession from the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist
Republic.''
   Armenians, most of whom are Christians, consider
Nagorno-Karabakh part of their ancestral homeland but in 1923 the
region was assigned to Azerbaijan, which is predominantly Moslem.
   The dispute began with demonstrations by Armenians in both
Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia itself in February and ethnic riots
were reported in Sumgait, an Azerbaijan port. Officials said 32
people were killed _ 26 Armenians and six Azerbaijanis _ and 200
injured.
   Gorbachev told a national Communist Party conference June 28 the
powers of the country's 15 republics and other ethnic entities
should be expanded, but said some ethnic minorities were going too
far.
   ``Some think that any questions, from the redrawing of borders
to the establishment of opposition parties, can be resolved''
through glasnost, Gorbachev said.
   ``The Central Committee believes such abuses of democratization
run counter to the task of perestroika, contradict the people's
interests,'' he said. Perestroika, or restructuring, is what
Gorbachev calls his plans for social and economic reform.
   Communist Party officials in Moscow rejected the territorial
demand in February, but said living conditions in Nagorno-Karabakh
would be improved.
   The Kremlin approved a multimillion-dollar package of social and
cultural improvements for the region in March, but strikes and
demonstrations continued.
   After Azerbaijan rejected the transfer request,
Nagorno-Karabakh's legislature proposed a compromise: putting the
region under temporary control of the central government in Moscow.
   Armenian delegates to the party conference in Moscow suggested
other compromises that included attaching the region to Stavropol,
Gorbachev's home district in the Russian republic.
   Azerbaijan's leaders did not budge.
   Medvedev said in a telephone interview that Tuesday's decision
appeared aimed at pressuring Moscow into approving the territorial
transfer.
   Pravda, the Communist Party newspaper, said on Tuesday an
``overwhelming majority'' of Armenians who began a strike July 4 in
Yerevan, the Armenian capital, had decided to return to work.
   Dissident journalist Mofses Gorgisyan said the walkout was
gaining strength, however, and that representatives of factories in
the republic of 3.4 million people reported 70 percent absenteeism
Monday.
   He said by telephone from Yerevan that soldiers and tanks were
deployed around the city's outskirts and militiamen patrolled
inside the city limits.
   The Central Committee of Armenia's Communist Party criticized
officials throughout the republic Tuesday for ``delaying, showing
carelessness and irresponsibility in the realization of practical
measures aimed at improving the situation,'' the government
newspaper Izvestia reported.
   Gorgisyan said 300,000 to 400,000 people gathered outside
Armenia's Institute of Ancient Manuscripts, known as the
Matenadaran, on Monday night to support the strike and press the
territorial demand. A reporter for the republic's official news
agency, Armenpress, said the number was about 100,000.
   Gorgisyan, 27, belongs to an underground group called the
Alliance for National Self-Determination and publishes an
underground journal called Fatherland.

<HEAD>Boy May Face Kidney Dysfunction as Result of Brownsville Accident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GALVESTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A boy trapped for 20 hours under the
rubble of a collapsed department store may lose use of his kidneys,
doctors said.
   University of Texas Medical Branch physicians treating
9-year-old Jorge Mena of Merida, Mexico, said toxins from dead
muscle tissue apparently destroyed his body's ability to cleanse
his blood.
   However, doctors said Jorge's spunk may help him through the
critical first days of what may be a months-long stay at the
hospital.
   ``He's mad, and he's scared,'' said Jason Calhoun, an orthopedic
surgeon.
   Mena and a cousin who lost a leg in the accident in Brownsville
last week are receiving high-pressure oxygen treatments. Both are
in critical condition, officials said.
   ``He complains the whole time he is in the (hyperbaric)
chamber,'' said Dr. John Mader, who is overseeing Mena's treatment
at UTMB's Marine Biomedical Institute.
   ``But that's good,'' Mader said, ``because he's a fighter, and
that is what it takes.''
   Jorge's mother remained hospitalized in Brownsville and a
15-year-old sister, Mya, died in the accident, authorities said.
The boy's father, who like his son speaks no English, lies outside
the chamber window so he can look at the boy.
   ``They communicate over the telephone,'' Mader said. ``The
father gives the boy a lot of support. Otherwise, he'd be
unmanageable.''
   Jorge's cousin, Yvette Lire, 14, of Brownsville, has shown some
improvement since her right leg was amputated below the knee,
Calhoun said.
   Yvette's sister, Paloma, 12, died in the accident.
   The Amigo Store collapsed during heavy rain Friday, killing 14
people and injuring at least 47 others. Investigators have not
determined the cause.

<HEAD>Bill Would Ban U.S. Exports of Waste</HEAD>
<HEAD>By CARL HARTMAN</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michigan Rep. John J. Conyers and three other
congressmen on Tuesday introduced a bill that would ban the export
of most American waste.
   The legislation would cover any hazardous waste, waste oil,
incinerator ash and other forms of solid waste, with some
exceptions for material that would be recycled in the country
receiving it. Violators would be subject to as much as two years in
prison and fines of $50,000, with both to be doubled on a second
offense.
   Conyers, a Democrat, said at a news conference that the
legislation would apply to both rich and poor countries. He
emphasized the effect of U.S. waste exports in the Third World,
calling them ``an act of toxic terrorism.'' He said poor countries
could be tempted by the offer of large sums by U.S. companies.
   According to Jim Vallette, a researcher for Greenpeace, eight
industrial countries have received U.S. waste since 1986:
Australia, Finland, Canada, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, Britain and
West Germany. Vallette added that some of the waste shipped to
Third World countries has gone through Italy.
   A Greenpeace report said that Britain has become a major
recipient of waste from Europe, the United States and recently from
New Zealand, largely because fees for its waste disposal are much
lower than in continental Europe.
   The Greenpeace report said at least 11 Third World countries
have received waste from the United States and Europe in that
period: Brazil, Guinea, Lebanon, Sierra Leone, Syria, Venezuela,
Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Haiti.
   Conyers, a Democrat, was joined by two other Democrats _ Reps.
James J. Florio of New Jersey and Chester G. Atkins of
Massachusetts _ and Republican Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa, in
sponsoring the bill. It would exempt Canada and Mexico from the
export ban because they have agreements with the U.S. government on
waste disposal.

<HEAD>Dukakis ``Trying to Break Bush's Back in Texas''</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis' choice of Texas Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen as his vice presidential nominee balances the geographical
and ideological scales of the Democratic ticket _ and provides a
staunch challenge to George Bush in a state the vice president
calls his home.
   ``They are trying to break Bush's back in Texas,'' said
Republican pollster Lance Tarrance.
   Indeed, it's almost as if Texas is suddenly the only state that
counts for the Democrats. The convention chairman is from Texas:
House Speaker Jim Wright. The keynote speaker is from Texas: state
Treasurer Ann Richards. And now the vice presidential choice.
   ``They haven't just taken a bow toward Texas: they
genuflected,'' said Democratic consultant Mark Mellman. Dukakis has
``made a very big investment in Texas,'' he added. ``We better win
it now.''
   A key question is whether Bentsen does anything for the
Democratic ticket outside Texas.
   One argument is that he will reassure the white Southern males
who have deserted the party by the millions in recent elections,
persuading them the Democrats are not too liberal and concerned
with minorities and special interests.
   But the flip side is that Bentsen is little known outside his
home state _ except in Louisiana and Oklahoma. Except for those
three states, he might not make any difference. But then, vice
presidential candidates rarely make much of a difference, since the
focus is on the presidential candidates.
   Texas holds 29 electoral votes, more than 10 percent of the 278
needed to win the White House in November. The state ranks third,
behind only California and New York.
   That is clearly the central reason for choosing Bentsen over the
other names on Dukakis' short list. Historians are fond of saying
Democrats have not won the presidency in this century without
winning Texas. What is less often said is that winning Texas does
not guarantee a Democratic victory. Hubert Humphrey won the Lone
Star State in 1968, for example, and still lost to Richard Nixon.
   Bush calls Texas his home, still voting there even though the
only home he actually owns these days is on the coastline of Maine.
   ``It makes Texas a battleground, where before Bush had Texas
sewn up,'' said Republican strategist Vince Breglio. It's a direct
shot at the Republicans' natural base for the presidential contest.
   The more time and money the Democrats can force the Republicans
to spend winning states in the South _ where the GOP national
ticket has been strong in recent years _ the less time and money
Bush and his running mate will be able to spend in California,
Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and New York.
   Now Bush must face his choice of a running mate.
   He could choose to counter the Democratic thrust in the South by
picking someone from the region for the No. 2 spot _ like former
Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander. Or he can make a move into the
Northeast _ which should be Dukakis' strong area _ with a choice
such as Rep. Jack Kemp of New York.
   Bush can also go to California and try to nail down that state's
47 electoral votes with Gov. George Deukmejian as a running mate.
Or he can mend fences in the Midwest with Senate GOP leader Bob
Dole of Kansas.
   Dukakis' choice of Bentsen broadens the Democratic appeal in
crucial ways for the fall campaign.
   The liberal Massachusetts governor will be running with the
conservative Washington insider from the Southwest.
   The specialist in economic growth is paired with the legislative
expert with a reputation in international economics.
   The opponent of aid to the Contras chose a supporter of such
funding.
   ``It cuts down the angle at which Bush can shoot,'' said
Democratic pollster Peter Hart. ``They can't say the ticket is
inexperienced or too liberal.''
   Bentsen will certainly help the Democratic Party reach out to
conservative businessmen who have rarely backed the party's
hopefuls. Bentsen has been masterful at gathering campaign
contributions from normally GOP sources, a fact that has
Republicans awed and a bit peeved.

<HEAD>The Restoration of Competence and the Revival of Hope</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   We the people of the Democratic Party of the United States of
America, in order to initiate the changes necessary to keep America
strong and make America better, in order to restore competence,
caring and incorruptibility to the federal Executive Branch and get
it working again fairly for all Americans, and in order to secure
for our children a future of liberty and opportunity, hereby pledge
our party, our leaders, our elected officials and our every
individual effort to fulfilling the following fundamental
principles for all members of the American family.
   We believe that all Americans have a fundamental right to
economic justice in a stronger, surer national economy, an economy
that must grow steadily without inflation, that can generate a
rising standard of living for all and fulfill the desire of all to
work in dignity up to their full potential in good health with good
jobs at good wages, an economy that is prosperous in every region,
from coast to coast, including our rural towns and our older
industrial communities, our mining towns, our energy producing
areas and the urban areas that have been neglected for the past
seven years.
   We believe that, as a first-rate world power moving into the
21st century, we can have a first-rate full employment economy,
with an indexed minimum wage that can help lift and keep families
out of poverty, with training and employment programs _ including
child care and health care _ that can help people move from welfare
to work, with portable pensions and an adequate Social Security
System, safeguarded against emasculation and privatization, that
can help assure a comfortable and fulfilling old age, with
opportunities for voluntary national public service, above and
beyond current services, that can enrich our communities, and with
all workers assured the protection of an effective law that
guarantees their rights to organize, join the union of their
choice, and bargain collectively with their employer, free from
anti-union tactics.
   We believe that the time has come for America to take charge
once again of its economic future, to reverse seven years of
``voodoo economics,'' ``trickle down'' policies, fiscal
irresponsibility, and economic violence against poor and working
people that have converted this proud country into the world's
largest debtor nation, mortgaged our children's future by tripling
our national debt, placed home ownership out of reach for most
young families, permitted the rise of poverty and homelessness on
the streets of America, reduced the buying power of working men and
women, and witnessed the decline of our industrial, natural
resource and mining base, the unending tragedy of family farm
foreclosures, an unhealthy dependence on foreign energy and foreign
capital, and the increasing foreign ownership of our land and
natural resources.
   We believe that it is time for America, within a strong
commitment to fiscal responsibility, to reassert progressive values
and reinvest in its people, to invest in new priorities, in
life-long education and training, in targeted economic development,
in a healthy small business community and in retooled American
industry; that it is time for the broad revitalization of home town
America, involving financial institutions in the provision of
crucial credit by encouraging special commitments in exchange for
bailing out those that are failing, reforming and expanding
community reinvestment laws, and reversing the trend of financial
concentration and deregulation, all combining to reverse the
insecurity that has increasingly troubled our workers and their
families in this rapidly changing society that has left some
communities and regions behind.
   There is no good reason why the nation we love, the greatest and
richest nation on earth, should rank first among the industrialized
nations in output per person but nearly last in infant mortality,
first in the percentage of total expenditures devoted to defense
but nearly last in the percentage devoted to education and housing.
   We believe that government should set the standard in
recognizing that worker productivity is enhanced by the principle
of pay equity for working women and no substandard wage competition
for public contracts; by family leave policies that no longer force
employees to choose between their jobs and their children or ailing
parents; by safe and healthy work places, now jeopardized by seven
callous years of lowered and unenforced occupational safety
standards for American workers; and by major increases in
assistance making child care more available and affordable to
low-and middle-income families, helping states build a strong child
care infrastructure, setting minimum standards for health, safety,
and quality, and thereby enabling parents to work and their
children to get an early start on their education and personal
fulfillment.
   We believe that the strength of our families is enhanced by
programs to prevent abuse and malnutrition among children, crime,
dropouts and pregnancy among teenagers and violence in the family;
by aggressive child support enforcement; and by emphasizing family
preservation and quality foster care.
   We believe that America needs more trade, fair trade, an
administration willing to use all the tools available to better
manage our trade in order to export more American goods and fewer
American jobs, an administration willing to recognize in the
formulation and enforcement of our trade laws that workers' rights
are important human rights abroad as well as at home, and that
advance notice of plant closings and major layoffs is not only
fundamentally right but also economically sound. We believe that we
can and must improve our competitiveness in the world economy,
using our best minds to create the most advanced technology in the
world through a greater commitment to civilian research and
development and to science, engineering and mathematics training,
through more public-private and business-labor cooperation and
mutual respect, through more intergovernmental partnerships, and
through a better balance between fiscal and monetary policy and
between military and civilian research and development.
   We further believe in halting such irresponsible corporate
conduct as unproductive takeovers, monopolistic mergers, insider
trading, and golden parachutes for executives by reinvigorating our
antitrust and securities laws, reviewing large mergers, and
discouraging short-term speculation taking place at the expense of
long-term investment.

   We believe that the education of our citizens, from Head Start
to institutions of higher learning, deserves our highest priority,
and that history will judge the next administration less by its
success in building new weapons of war than by its success in
improving young minds. We believe that this nation needs to invest
in its children on the front side of life by expanding the
availability of pre-school education for children at risk; to
invest in its teachers through training and enrichment programs,
including a National Teacher Corps to recruit teachers for
tomorrow, especially minorities, with scholarships today; to commit
itself for the first time to the principle that no one should be
denied the opportunity to attend college for financial reasons; to
ensure equal access to education by providing incentives and
mechanisms for the equalization of financing among local school
districts within each state; to reverse cuts made in compensatory
reading, math and enrichment services to low income children; and
to expand support for bilingual education, historically Black and
Hispanic institutions, the education of those with special needs,
the arts and humanities, and an aggressive campaign to end
illiteracy.
   We believe that illegal drugs pose a direct threat to the
security of our nation from coast to coast, invading our
neighborhoods, classrooms, homes and communities large and small;
that every arm and agency of government at every federal, state and
local level _ including every useful diplomatic, military,
educational, medical and law enforcement effort necessary _ should
at long last be mobilized and coordinated with private efforts
under the direction of a national drug ``czar'' to halt both the
international supply and the domestic demand for illegal drugs now
ravaging our country; and that the legalization of illicit drugs
would represent a tragic surrender in a war we intend to win. We
believe that this effort should include comprehensive programs to
educate our children at the earliest ages on the dangers of alcohol
and drug abuse, readily available treatment and counseling for
those who seek to address their dependency, the strengthening of
vital interdiction agencies such as the U.S. Coast Guard and
Customs, a summit of Western hemispheric nations to coordinate
efforts to cut off drugs at the source, and foreign development
assistance to reform drug-based economics by promoting crop
substitution.
   We believe that the federal government should provide increased
assistance to local criminal justice agencies, enforce a ban on
``cop killer'' bullets that have no purpose other than the killing
and maiming of law enforcement officers, reinforce our commitment
to help crime victims, and assume a leadership role in securing the
safety of our neighborhoods and homes. We further believe that the
repeated toleration in Washington of unethical and unlawful greed
among too many of those who have been governing our nation,
procuring our weapons and polluting our environment has made far
more difficult the daily work of the local policemen, teachers and
parents who must convey to our children respect for justice and
authority.
   We believe that we honor our multicultural heritage by assuring
equal access to government services, employment, housing, business
enterprise and education to every citizen regardless of race, sex,
national origin, religion, age, handicapping condition or sexual
orientation; that these rights are without exception too precious
to be jeopardized by federal judges and Justice Department
officials chosen during the past seven years _ by a political party
increasingly monolithic both racially and culturally _ more for
their unenlightened ideological views than for their respect for
the rule of law. We further believe that we must work for the
adoption of the Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution; that
the fundamental right of reproductive choice should be guaranteed
regardless of ability to pay; that our machinery for civil rights
enforcement and legal services to the poor should be rebuilt and
vigorously utilized; and that our immigration policy should be
reformed to promote fairness, non-discrimination and family
reunification and to reflect our constitutional freedoms of speech,
association and travel.
   We further believe that the voting rights of all minorities
should be protected, the recent surge in hate violence and negative
stereotyping combated, the discriminatory English-only pressure
groups resisted, our treaty commitments with native Americans
enforced by culturally sensitive officials, and the lingering
effects of past discrimination eliminated by affirmative action,
including goals, timetables, and procurement set-asides.
   We believe that the housing crisis of the 1980s must be halted _
a crisis that has left this country battered by a rising tide of
homelessness unprecedented since the Great Depression, by a
tightening squeeze on low- and moderate-income families that is
projected to leave 7 million people without affordable housing by
1993, and by a bleak outlook for young working families who cannot
afford to buy their first home. We believe that steps should be
taken to ensure a decent place to live for every American.
   We believe that homelessness _ a national shame _ should be
ended in America; that the supply of affordable housing should be
expended in order to avoid the projected shortfall; that
employer-assisted housing and development by community based
non-profit organizations should be encouraged; that the inventory
of public and subsidized housing should be renovated, preserved and
increased; that foreclosed government property should be restored
to productive use; and that first-time homebuyers should be
assisted.
   We believe that we can rebuild America, creating good jobs at
good wages through a national reinvestment strategy to construct
new housing, repair our sewers, rebuild our roads and replace our
bridges. We believe that we must pursue needed investment through
innovative partnerships and creative financing mechanisms such as a
voluntary program to invest a portion of public and private pension
funds as a steady source of investment capital by guaranteeing
security and a fair rate of return and assuring sound project
management.

   We believe that all Americans should enjoy access to affordable,
comprehensive health services for both the physically and mentally
ill, from prenatal care for pregnant women at risk to more adequate
care for our Vietnam and other veterans, from well-baby care to
childhood immunization to Medicare; that federal coordination and
leadership are necessary to contain health care costs while
assuring quality care and advanced medical research; that quality,
affordable, long-term home and health care should be available to
all senior and disabled citizens, allowing them to live with
dignity in the most appropriate setting; that an important first
step toward comprehensive health services is to ensure that every
family should have the security of basic health insurance; and that
the HIV-AIDS epidemic is an unprecedented public health emergency
requiring increased support for accelerated research on, and
expedited FDA approval of, treatments and vaccines, comprehensive
education and prevention, compassionate patient care, adoption of
the public health community consensus on voluntary and confidential
testing and counseling, and protection of the civil rights of those
suffering from AIDS or AIDS-Related Complex or testing positive for
the HIV antibody.
   We believe that the last seven years have witnessed an
unprecedented assault on our national interest and national
security through the poisoning of our air with acid rain, the
dumping of toxic wastes into our water, and the destruction of our
parks and shores; that pollution must be stopped at the source by
shifting to new, environmentally sound manufacturing and farming
technologies; that the federal government must promote recycling as
the best, least costly way to solve the trash crisis, aggressively
enforce toxic waste laws and require polluters to be responsible
for future cleanup costs; that this nation must redouble its
efforts to provide clean waterways, sound water management and safe
drinkable ground water throughout the country; that our national
parks, forests, wildlife refuges, and coastal zones must be
protected and used only in an environmentally sound manner; that
all offshore oil drilling in environmentally sensitive areas should
be opposed; and that regular world environment summits should be
convened by the United States to address the depletion of the ozone
layer, the ``greenhouse effect,'' the destruction of tropical
forests and other global threats and to create a global action plan
for environmental restoration.
   We believe that all Americans, producers and consumers alike,
benefit when food and fiber are produced not by a few large
corporations and conglomerates but by hundreds of thousands of
family farmers obtaining a fair price for their product; that the
disastrous farm policies of the last seven years, despite record
federal spending, have forced hundreds of thousands of families
from their farms while others are struggling to survive; and that a
workable agricultural policy should include supply management,
reasonable price supports, soil conservation and protection of
rural water quality, credit and foreclosure relief, the return of
federally held foreclosed lands to minority, beginning and
restarting farmers, the development of new uses and markets for
American farm products, improved disaster relief, and the
revitalization of rural America through new sources of capital for
rural business and new federal support for rural health care,
housing, education, water supply and infrastructure.
   We further believe that no person should go to bed hungry and
that we must renew the fight against hunger at home and abroad,
make food available to those nations who need it and want it, and
convene an international conference of food producing nations.
   We believe that a balanced, coherent energy policy, based on
dependable supplies at reasonable prices, is necessary to protect
our national security, ensure a clean environment, and promote
stable economic growth and prosperity, both nationally and in our
energy producing regions; that the inevitable transition from our
present, nearly total dependence on increasingly scarce and
environmentally damaging non-renewable sources to renewable sources
should begin now; that such a policy includes increased cooperation
with our hemispheric neighbors, filling that Strategic Petroleum
Reserve, promoting the use of natural gas, methanol and ethanol as
alternative transportation fuels, encouraging the use of our vast
natural gas and coal reserves while aggressively developing clean
coal technology to combat acid rain, and providing targeted new
incentives for new oil and gas drilling and development, for the
development of renewable and alternative sources of energy, and for
the promotion of energy conservation.
   We believe that with these changes the country could reduce its
reliance on nuclear power while insisting that all plants are safe,
environmentally sound and assured of safe waste disposal.
   We believe that this country's democratic processes must be
revitalized: by securing universal, same day and mail-in voter
registration as well as registration on the premises of appropriate
government agencies; by preventing the misuse of at-large
elections, the abuse of election day challenges and registration
roll purges, any undercounting in the national census, and any
dilution of the one-person, one-vote principle; by ending
discrimination against public employees who are denied the right to
full political participation; by supporting statehood for the
District of Columbia; by treating the offshore territories under
our flag as full partners, in spirit, of the American political
family, by empowering the commonwealth of Puerto Rico with greater
autonomy within its relationship with the United States to achieve
the economic, social and political goals of its people, and by
giving it just and fair participation in federal programs; by
assuring and pledging the full and equal access of women and
minorities to elective office and party endorsement; and by
minimizing the domination and distortion of our election by moneyed
interests.
   We believe in a stronger America ready to make the tough choices
of leadership in an ever-dangerous world: militarily stronger in
our overall defense and anti-terrorist capabilities and in the
cohesion of our military alliances; economically stronger at home
and in the global marketplace; intellectually stronger in the
advances of our schools, science and technology; and spiritually
stronger in the principles we exemplify to the world.
   We believe in a clearheaded, tough-minded, decisive American
foreign policy that will reflect the changing nature of threats to
our security and respond to them in a way that reflects our values
and the support of our people, a foreign policy that will respect
our Constitution, our Congress and our traditional democratic
principles and will in turn be respected for its quiet strength,
its bipartisan goals, and its steadfast attention to the concerns
and contributions of our allies and international organizations.
   We believe that we must reassume a role of responsible active
international leadership based upon our commitment to democracy,
human rights and a more secure world; that this nation, as the
world power with the broadest global interests and concerns, has a
greater stake than any in building a world at peace and governed by
law; that we can neither police the world nor retreat from it; and
that to have reliable allies we must be a reliable ally.

   We believe that our national strength has been sapped by a
defense establishment wasting money on duplicative and dubious new
weapons instead of investing more in readiness and mobility; that
our national strength will be enhanced by more stable defense
budgets and by a commitment from our allies to assume a greater
share of the costs and responsibilities reqired to maintain peace
and liberty; and that as military spending and priorities change,
government should encourage the conversion of affected military
facilities and the retraining of workers to facilitate the creation
of new forms of communication, space development and new peacetime
growth and productivity.
   We believe in an America, neither gun-shy nor trigger-happy,
that will promote peace and prevent war _ not by trading weapons
for hostages, not by sending brave Americans to undefined missions
in Lebanon and Honduras, not by relaxing our vigilance on the
assumption that long-range Soviet interests have permanently
changed, not by toasting a tyrant-like Marcos as a disciple of
democracy, but by maintaining a stable nuclear deterrent sufficient
to counter any Soviet threat, by standing up to any American
adversary whenever necessary and sitting down with him whenever
possible, by making clear our readiness to use force when force is
required to protect our essential security commitments, by testing
the intentions of the new Soviet leaders about arms control,
emigration, human rights and other issues, and by matching them not
merely in rhetoric but in reciprocal initiatives and innovation, in
joint efforts to combat environmental threats, explore peaceful
uses of space and eradicate disease and poverty in the development
world, and in a mutual effort to transform the arms race that
neither side can win into a contest for people's minds, a contest
we know our side will win.
   We believe in following up the INF Treaty, a commendable first
step, with mutual, verifiable and enforceable agreements that will
make significant reductions in strategic weapons in a way that
diminishes the risk of nuclear attack by either superpower; reduce
conventional forces to lower and equivalent levels in Europe,
requiring deeper cuts on the Warsaw Pact side; ban chemical and
space weapons in their entirety; and halt all nuclear weapons
testing while strengthening our efforts to prevent the spread of
these weapons to other nations before the nightmare of nuclear
terrorism engulfs us all.
   We believe in an America that recognizes not only the realities
of East-West relations but the challenges and opportunities of the
developing world; that will support and strengthen international
law and institutions, promote human and political rights and
measure them by one yardstick, and work for economic growth and
development. We believe that we must provide leadership, compassion
and economic assistance to those nations stunted by overwhelming
debt, deprivation and austerity, and that we must work to promote
active agreements between developing and industrial countries, and
the major public and commercial lenders, to provide debt relief and
rekindle and sustain economic growth and democracy in Latin
America, Asia, and the poorest continent, Africa, which deserves
special attention. We further believe that we must enlist the trade
surplus nations to join with us in supporting new aid initiatives
to fuel growth in developing countries that, though economically
depressed, are rich in human and natural potential.
   We believe this country should work harder to stop the supplies
of arms, from both East and West, that fuel conflict in regions
such as the Persian Gulf and Angola.
   Deeply disturbed that the current administration has too long
abandoned the peace process in the Middle East and consistently
undermined it in Central America, we believe that this country,
maintaining the special relationship with Israel founded upon
mutually shared values and strategic interests, should provide new
leadership to deliver the promise of peace and security through
negotiations that has been held out to Israel and its neighbors by
the Camp David Accords and to Central America by the Arias Peace
Plan, which calls for an end to the fighting, national
reconciliation, guarantees of human rights, democracy, and
security, enabling the United States and other nations to focus on
the pressing social and economic needs of the people of that region.
   We further believe in pursuing a policy of economic cooperation
instead of confrontation with Mexico and our other hemispheric
friends; in helping all developing countries build their own
peaceful democratic institutions free from foreign troops,
subversion and domination and free from domestic dictators and
aggressors; in honoring our treaty obligations; and in using all
the tools at our disposal, including diplomacy, trade, aid, food,
ideas, and ideals, to defend and enlarge the horizons of freedom on
this planet.
   We believe in an America that will promote human rights, human
dignity and human opportunity in every country on earth; that will
encourage free speech and association and decry oppression in
nations friendly and unfriendly, Communist and non-communist, that
will encourage our European friends to respect human rights and
resolve their longstanding differences over North Ireland and
Cyprus; that will encourage wherever possible the forces of
pluralism and democracy in Eastern Europe and that will support the
struggle for human rights in Asia.
   We believe the apartheid regime in South Africa to be a uniquely
repressive regime, ruthlessly deciding every aspect of public and
private life by skin color, engaging in unrelenting violence
against its citizens at home and promoting naked aggression against
its neighbors in Africa.
   We believe that the time has come to end all vestiges of the
failed policy of constructive engagement, to declare South Africa a
terrorist state, to impose comprehensive sanctions upon its
economy, to lead the international community in participation in
these actions, and to determine a date certain by which United
States corporations must leave South Africa.
   We further believe that to achieve regional security in Southern
Africa, we must press forcefully for Namibia's independence by
calling for the end of South Africa's illegal occupation, a cease
fire and elections, must end our counterproductive policy in Angola
and must offer support and further assistance to Mozambique and
other frontline states.
   In sum, we believe it is time for America to change and move
forward again in the interest of all its families _ to turn away
from an era in which too many of America's children have been
homeless or hungry and invest in a new era of hope and progress, an
era of secure families in a secure America in a secure world.
   We believe the American dream of opportunity for every citizen
can be a reality for all Americans willing to meet their own
responsibilities to help make it come true.
   We believe that governments at the national, state and local
level, in partnerships between those levels and in partnerships
with the private sector, exist to help us solve our problems
instead of adding to them. We believe in competent, pragmatic
governments, accountable to the people, led by men and women
dedicated not to self interest but to service, motivated not by
ideology but by American ideals, governing not in a spirit of power
and privilege but with a sense of compassion and community.
   For many years, in state and local capitals across this nation,
Democrats have been successfully solving problems and helping
people with exactly this kind of innovative government.
   Therefore, the Democratic Party in convention assembled and
united, the party of hope and change and fairness for all, hereby
declares its readiness to end the stalemate in Washington by
challenging, encouraging and inviting the American people _
challenging them to do their patriotic best to meet their community
responsibilities, encouraging them to protect and preserve their
families, our most precious assets, and inviting them to join with
us in leading the land we love to a brighter and still greater
future of opportunity and justice for all.

Negotiations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Democratic Platform Committee released a
4,700-word proposed platform Tuesday without the minority planks
that the Jackson campaign may still push.
   Eleanor Holmes Norton, Jesse Jackson's chief platform
negotiator, said, ``Our minority reports are not in there because
we're still negotiating.''
   Jackson has said he may press floor fights in Atlanta next
Tuesday on a dozen or more issues, including his call for higher
taxes on the wealthy, a Pentagon freeze, more spending on education
and Head Start, no-first-use of nuclear weapons and Palestinian
self-determination.
   He is expected, however, to take only three or four of his key
issues to the floor for votes. With 1,135 delegates, Jackson can
force debates on any issue, but Dukakis's majority of 2,426 is
large enough to leave no doubt as to who will win the fights.
   The proposed platform, hammered out June 25 by the party's
platform writers in Denver, commits the Democrats ``to reverse
seven years of voodoo economics,'' to ``more stable defense
budgets,'' to advance notice of plant layoffs and to guaranteed
``freedom of reproductive choice ... regardless of ability to pay.''
   It avoids any mention of tax increases and does not say how
Dukakis and the Democrats would deal with the huge federal deficits.
   Norton, on her way to a meeting with Jackson, said, ``The
negotiations are going well.''
   The party, in a memorandum appended to the document, said: ``To
avoid delay in printing the platform, all parties have agreed that
the report on minority planks, which is still under discussion,
will be available at the convention.''
   The proposed platform, written with the help of onetime
President Kennedy speechwriter Ted Sorensen, is one-tenth the
length of the 45,000-word tome the Democrats ran on in 1984. Party
chairman Paul G. Kirk Jr. said the Democrats would be better served
by a short, visionary statement stripped of special interest
language that discomfited some Democrats and delighted Republicans.
   The platform, titled ``The Resoration of Competence and the
Revival of Hope,'' endorses ``pay equity for working women and no
substandard wage competition for public contracts''; ``major
increases'' in child care aid for low- and middle-income families;
an indexed minimum wage, and a National Teacher Corps to recruit
teachers with scholarships.
   The platform also backs expanded support for bilingual
education; appointment of a national drug czar; a ban on ``cop
killer'' bullets; passage of the Equal Rights Amendmment;
accelerated research on AIDS ``and protection of the civil rights
of those suffering from AIDS'' or testing positive for the IV
antibody.''
   It also condemns South Africa as a ``terrorist'' state; endorses
same-day and mail-in voter registration, and decries ``any dilution
of the one-person, one-vote principle''; supports statehood for the
District of Columbia and ``greater autonomy for Puerto Rico,'' and
pledges ``the full and equal access of women and minorities to
elective office and party endorsement.''
   ``We believe in an America, neither gun-shy nor trigger-happy,
that will promote peace and prevent war _ not by trading weapons
for hostages, not by sending brave Americans to undefined missions
in Lebanon and Honduras ... not by toasting a tyrant like Marcos as
a disciple of democracy, but by maintaining a stable nuclear
deterrent sufficient to counter any Soviet threat. ... '' the
platform says.
   It calls for reinvigorating the Camp David peace process in the
Middle East and support for Costa Rican President Oscar Arias'
peace plan in Central America.
   It mentions neither Ronald Reagan nor George Bush by name.

<HEAD>House OKs Mechanism to Close Unneeded Bases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House, trying to solve one of its toughest
political issues, voted 374-39 Tuesday to give the Pentagon a
chance to save money by shutting down unneeded military bases.
   The chamber passed a complicated plan that involves having an
independent commission decide which bases to close.
   ``For too many years, obsolete military bases have been treated
as sacred cows and the country cannot afford this anymore,'' Rep.
Chalmers Wylie, R-Ohio, told his colleagues. ``The time has come
for Congress to stiffen its backbone.''
   The Defense Department estimates that between $2 billion and $5
billion a year can be saved if the military is allowed to close
installations it says are obsolete.
   But bases mean jobs and since 1977 Congress has enacted a stiff
and complex series of laws that have prevented the Pentagon from
shutting down any of the 3,800 military installations in the
continental United States.
   The plan approved Tuesday calls for a nine-member commission,
which will makes its recommendations to President Reagan by next
Dec. 31. The president would then have until Jan. 16, four days
before leaving office, to either accept or reject the entire list.
He could not approve a partial list.
   Congress could block the closures by a majority vote in both the
House and Senate.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci backs the plan and has
already appointed a nine-member commission, which has been meeting
for the past month.
   The commission will also study the 1,900 military installations
maintained by the United States in foreign nations, but will not
have authority to recommend closures there.
   In approving the plan, the House rejected a different
base-closing proposal, which would have retained a few of the
current restrictions. The version approved Tuesday was first
adopted on a 223-186 vote shortly before the final passage.
   The House action sends the bill to a House-Senate conference
committee to resolve differences with a Senate-passed version. The
Senate measure was approved as an amendment to a Pentagon budget
bill, but was later dropped out of that legislation.
   In the decades after World War II, when the nation was winding
down from its large military structure, the Pentagon was usually
allowed to what it wanted on the issue, with the exception of a
handful of bases protected by key members. Between 1961 and 1977,
the Pentagon shut down 3,600 installations.
   But in 1975, the Air Force proposed shutting down Loring Air
Force Base in northern Maine. That state's legislators blocked the
move by requiring lengthy _ and costly _ environmental impact
studies for the Loring closure and all future closings.
   Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, chief sponsor of the base-closing
plan, said the House action ``will go a long way toward cutting fat
instead of muscle from our national defense.''
   Armey's plan was rejected a year ago, 199-192, but he offered
the proposal again because he argued that a lame-duck
administration might be willing to approve the unpopular cuts.
   Rep. Toby Roth, R-Wis., urged approval of the bill because he
said ``it's time to cut the pork out of the budget process ... it's
the right thing for the country.''
   Rep. Les AuCoin, D-Ore., agreed, saying: ``This whole program of
bases is not a welfare program ... it's not an economic program. We
should have bases for one reason and one reason only _ because they
serve military needs.''
   In working through the bill, the House voted down, on a voice
vote, a proposed amendment that would have required the closure of
foreign bases before U.S. bases are shut down.
   The chamber also rejected, on another voice vote, a move that
would have added four members of Congress to the commission.

   A defendant in a Contra arms-smuggling indictment
blasted the charges against him Tuesday as a whitewash aimed at
covering up illegal activities of Oliver North and the Reagan
administration.
   Jack Terrell, a one-time mercenary who turned against the U.S.
Contra policy and then cooperated with investigators, said he was
informed Tuesday he has been charged in a Fort Lauderdale
indictment still sealed by the U.S. attorney's office here.
   The indictment handed up last month is believed to accuse a
small number of men with violating the U.S. Neutrality Act by
conspiring to aid the Contras to overthrow the Nicaraguan
government.
   ``I have some news for this administration,'' Terrell said in a
statement released in Washington. ``I won't take the fall for Rob
Owen, Ollie North or Ronald Reagan.''
   Terrell said the indictments were returned only because Congress
got wind that Miami's then-U.S. Attorney Leon Kellner was trying to
stop the investigation at the behest of Attorney General Edwin
Meese III.
   Congress investigated charges that the probe was sidetracked,
but did not reach any conclusion.
   ``Clearly, the only reason why the (U.S.) attorney's office
sought these indictments is to protect itself,'' said Terrell.
Kellner ``couldn't admit that his investigation was a farce, and
that he and his staff had participated in a coverup.''
   He said he had been cooperating with the U.S. attorney for two
years, giving information about high-level involvement in the
illegal supply network, but wound up being one of the few indicted.
   ``That's what I call shooting the messenger,'' he said.
   Kellner has quit the U.S. Attorney's office here and will be
practicing law in Washington. But he has previously denied charges
that he stonewalled the investigation, and said a congressional
committee that took testimony from prosecutors in his office failed
to find evidence that he slowed the investigation at Meese's
request.
   Terrell, who most recently worked for a liberal policy group in
Washington, became a vocal opponent of U.S. policy in Central
America. North eventually targeted him for his anti-Contra
activities, according to notes released during the Iran-Contra
affair.
   Until he changed his mind on aid to the Contras, Terrell aided
Civilian Materiel Assistance in its efforts to help the Nicaraguan
rebels.
   CMA's head Tom Posey has previously said he expects to be
indicted along with Terrell, and has also said he was working to
aid the Reagan administration.

   Weather conditions have been favorable for a
bumper grain harvest in the Soviet Union, in contrast to damage
done by heat and drought to U.S. crops, a report by the Agriculture
Department showed Tuesday.
   Precipitation was above normal in most of the Soviet Union's
European area, the report said. And more than twice the amount of
normal rain soaked crops in many of the other grain areas.
   Thus, the report said, total Soviet grain production this year
continues to be forecast at 215 million metric tons, the report
said. That would be the third year in a row that Soviet harvests
have exceeded 200 million tons, an unprecedented string of bumper
yields.
   It also would be the third largest Soviet grain harvest,
exceeded by the record crop of 237.4 million tons in 1978 and the
1976 harverst of 223.8 million tons.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.6 bushels
of wheat or 39.4 bushels of corn, as examples.
   Despite the bumper harvest, the Soviet Union continues to import
grain to help rebuild stockpiles and to make more available for an
expanding livestock sector.
   In a related announcement, the USDA said the Soviets have bought
an additional 350,000 tons of U.S. corn for delivery this year
under a long-term supply agreement between the two countries. That
would be about 13.8 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.76 per bushel at the
farm level, meaning that the sale could have a farm value of around
$38 million.
   The corn is part of the grain the Soviet Union is committed to
buy during the fifth and final year of the agreement, which calls
for the annual purchase of at least 9 million tons of U.S. grain.
The pact expires Sept. 30, and there have been negotiations for a
new one.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen Jr.'s selection as the
Democratic vice presidential nominee sent local pride surging in
his hometown 10 miles from the Mexican border, where the family
name stands for wealth and power.
   ``Everybody knows the Bentsens in South Texas, just like the du
Ponts or Kennedys (in New England),'' said Justo Gonzalez, who owns
a barber shop in downtown Mission.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the certain Democratic
presidential nominee, announced in Boston on Tuesday that he had
designated Bentsen as his running mate.
   Gonzalez and other local boosters said the nomination will bring
recognition to the Lower Rio Grande Valley.
   ``It will put us on the map, and as chambers of commerce, we are
always interested in that sort of notoriety,'' said Benny
Benavides, executive vice president of the Mission Chamber of
Commerce.
   The city of 25,000 in Hidalgo County was settled by Europeans in
1824, when the Roman Catholic Oblate Fathers began occupying an
area three miles south of the current city. Its name comes from a
mission the Oblates later built there.
   It is the center of the subtropical Texas citrus producing area,
and nearly surrounded by grapefruit groves and other farming
operations.
   Mobile home and recreational vehicle parks mix dot the
landscape, and retirees from the Midwest and Canada inflate
Mission's population during the winter to more than 50,000.
   The Lower Rio Grande Valley, actually a delta of the Rio Grande,
also has some of the poorest residents of the United States. Some
local officials were angered during a campaign swing by Jesse
Jackson, when the candidate described an unincorporated rural
subdivision as a ``little Ethiopia.''
   Mission's population is about 85 percent Mexican American, a
figure that probably would be higher without the real estate
promotions and business ventures of Lloyd Bentsen Sr.
   The elder Bentsen at age 94 still oversees about 42,000 acres of
farms and six ranches scattered over South Texas, an empire he
started carving out of the brush country in 1920.
   ``My children all grew up learning how to work,'' Bentsen Sr.
said Tuesday.
   Lloyd Jr., like his two younger brothers and one sister, worked
``mostly in the nurseries and of course spraying the orchards, and
working on the ranches and working cattle, the whole thing,'' the
proud father said.
   ``Lloyd don't think he's a conservative; he thinks he's a
moderate,'' Bentsen said as geese swam by on the 27-acre lake
behind his family's sprawling ranch house south of Mission.
   ``I shouldn't show this to anyone. It makes the
environmentalists mad,'' Bentsen said, opening the door to a trophy
room that includes the skins of a tiger, polar bears, brown bears
and grizzlies, along with a bison's head and other game.
   ``I don't know that much about Dukakis. What I hear is he's
probably more liberal in his viewpoints than Lloyd is,'' the elder
Bentsen said. ``It will help to balance the ticket.''

   Opposition presidential candidate Manuel J.
Clouthier and about 150 supporters scuffled with presidential
guards on Tuesday in the heart of Mexico City, then staged a sit-in
to protest alleged electoral fraud.
   As President Miguel de la Madrid arrived at the Fine Arts Palace
for a speech to about 2,500 lawyers, Clouthier stood up, carrying a
sign that read, ``Mr. President, keep your word.'' The sit-in went
on while de la Madrid spoke inside.
   Results from last Wednesday's elections released by the
governing Institutional Revolutionary Party showed its lowest
proportion of the vote since its founding 59 years ago. The party,
known by its Spanish initials PRI, generally wins the presidency
with at least 70 percent of the vote.
   The figures indicated, however, that this time the PRI will take
the presidency by only slightly more than 50 percent of the vote
and will pay little heed to opposition protests of election fraud.
   The white-bearded, heavy-set Clouthier, a businessman and
rancher, is the candidate of the conservative National Action
Party. He was running third in unofficial, partial returns from
last Wednesday's elections.
   Clouthier and the other top opposition candidate, Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas of the leftist National Democratic Front, claim the
government is rigging the vote count in favor of the PRI's Carlos
Salinas de Gortari.
   De la Madrid had pledged clean elections. Government and party
officials are calling the vote the cleanest ever in Mexico.
   Clouthier vowed to lead sit-ins at every event where de la
Madrid or Salinas is scheduled to appear, as part of a national
civil disobedience campaign to protest the alleged fraud. He said
earlier he would file criminal charges against the head of the
National Electoral Registry.
   Carrying signs reading ``Punishment for electoral criminals''
and ``Total repudiation of the electoral fraud,'' the group pushed
past a line of about 50 plainclothes presidential guards who tried
to stop them.
   After a scuffle, the group sat down at the entrance to the
ornate, landmark building in downtown Mexico City.
   The Federal Election Commission, the only source of official
results, adjourned early Tuesday and said it would not meet again
until Wednesday night. Seven days after the elections, it was
releasing official results only on balloting for the Chamber of
Deputies, the lower house of Congress.
   With the vote count lagging, the PRI again released data it said
came from the federal commission.
   Those results showed Salinas de Gortari had 53.59 percent of the
votes counted. Cardenas was second with 26.08 percent and Clouthier
had 16.04 percent.
   Two candidates for small parties and null ballots accounted for
the remainder.
   Those results showed a turnout of 51.7 percent in the 235 of the
300 districts tallied, the government newspaper El Nacional said.
But original reports claimed an exceptionally high turnout.
Earlier, the government and the governing party had blamed the high
turnout for the slowness of the vote count.
   Turnout was officially placed at 75 percent in the last
presidential race in 1982. But strong candidates and active
campaigns on the left and right spurred voter interest in the July
6 race.
   Cardenas charged on Monday that the election officials were not
counting many of the votes that had been cast for opposition
candidates. Cardenas claims he won, based on figures he says came
from unidentified PRI officials.
   Cardenas, a former PRI senator and Michoacan state governor, led
a dissident movement within the governing party before breaking
away last year to accept the candidacy of other parties.
   Ballots are counted at polling places immediately after the
election, but according to law those for the Chamber of Deputies
and for the Senate must be processed before those for president in
an official count.
   The only returns released officially by the commission so far
gave 241 of the 500 seats in the chamber to the PRI, 32 to the
National Action Party and 10 to parties that support Cardenas. The
results were from 283 of the 300 electoral districts.
   Victories by parties supporting Cardenas were in the state of
Mexico, which surrounds Mexico City, and Michoacan. Victories for
the National Action Party were in the western state of Jalisco, the
Federal District, which is the core of the Mexico City metropolitan
area, and the northern border state of Chihuahua.
   The governing party has not lost a presidential, senate or
gubernatorial race since it was founded in 1929.

<HEAD>Military Tribunal Battles Pentagon Attempt to Investigate Bribe
Allegations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A military tribunal is fighting the Pentagon's
attempt to investigate an anonymous allegation that bribery
influenced its decision overturning a Navy heart surgeon's
convictions for the deaths of three patients.
   The Navy-Marine Corps Court of Military Review obtained an order
from the Court of Military Appeals temporarily barring the Defense
Department's inspector general from proceeding with the
investigation.
   The military appeals court, which originally granted the
temporary injunction June 30, extended the order Monday for 15 days
pending its final decision in the matter.
   At issue, says Patrick J. Carome, a lawyer appointed to
represent the tribunal, is the independence of military courts from
interference by the Pentagon's command hierarchy.
   ``The judges feel this is a situation in which command influence
or at least the appearance of it is being brought to bear'' on the
tribunal's unpopular decision to set aside the negligent homicide
and involuntary manslaughter convictions of Cmdr. Donal M. Billig,
Carome said.
   On April 13, the Navy-Marine Corps tribunal overturned Billig's
conviction and accused Navy prosecutors of waging a ``smear
campaign'' against the surgeon, who had practiced at the Bethesda
Naval Hospital outside Washington.
   At a hearing Monday, Lt. Cmdr. Lawrence W. Muschamp told the
military appeals court that Billig's conviction could not be
revived even if the bribery allegations were proven.
   But June Gibbs Brown, the Pentagon's inspector general, told the
military review tribunal June 23 that the investigation could
affect its Billig ruling ``if the decision was procured by bribery
or fraud,'' according to court papers.
   Brown told the court ``there is no indication of any criminal
misconduct'' by the judges or the court staff, according to a
summary of her remarks to the judges.
   The allegation, received from an anonymous tipster who called
the inspector general's hotline May 2, has not been detailed by
Pentagon authorities. The tipster has been interviewed several
times but Pentagon authorities have not identified the person,
according to court papers.
   At Monday's hearing, Muschamp said the investigation would
involve only whether there was an improper outside attempt to
influence the court. Investigators would be careful not to intrude
in the decision-making process of the court.
   But Carome argued that a special judicial commission, not the
Pentagon inspector general, should conduct any investigation to
preserve the independence of the military court.
   ``Allowing the inspector general mechanism to kick into high
gear and focus in on a court in a particular decision in a
particular case based on a simple anonymous tip and nothing more,
really sets up a situation in which disgruntled parties after a
case can utilize this mechanism to harass and interfere with the
judicial process,'' Carome said in a telephone interview.
   ``There are a lot of people at the Navy and the Pentagon who are
unhappy with the result'' in the Billig case, he said.

<HEAD>Government Delays Hanging Of Sharpeville Six</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government postponed the
executions of the Sharpeville Six indefinitely Tuesday and Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain promised a new plea for
clemency by world leaders.
   Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee said the executions by hanging of
the six blacks were delayed so the Appellate Court, South Africa's
highest tribunal, can respond to their appeals.
   The last stay of execution for the five men and one woman was
until July 19. They were convicted in the mob killing of a town
council member in the Sharpeville black township, and originally
were scheduled to die in March. The six had originally been
sentenced to hang in March.
   Their convictions were based on the principle of ``common
purpose.'' They were part of a crowd that stoned and burned town
councilor Kuzwayo Dlamini to death in September 1984.
   Intense controversy surrounds the death sentences because the
six were cleared of directly causing victim's death, and because
violence against a town councilor who cooperated with South
Africa's apartheid policy of racial segregation is considered by
many to be a political crime.
   Many foreign leaders have asked President P.W. Botha to grant
clemency to the six: Francis Mokgesi, 31; Reid Mokoena, 24; Oupa
Moses Diniso, 32; Theresa Ramashamola, 27; Duma Joshua Khumalo, 28,
and Reginald Sefatsa, 32.
   Botha refused to intervene in March Supreme Court Judge Willem
Human of Transvaal province, who had sentenced them, granted a
temporary stay hours before the time of execution at Pretoria
Central Prison.
   Defense attorneys said the trial should be reopened because some
witnesses had said police forced them to give false testimony.
   One prosecution witness, Steve Manete, wrote to Botha last week
that he was assaulted and threatened by police to falsely identify
two of the accused as being at the scene of Dlamini's death. He
said other state witnesses also were ``unhappy with their
testimony'' against the Sharpeville Six and begged Botha to stop
the executions.
   Judge Human decided June 13 not to reopen the case because, he
said, the court had not relied solely on the suspect witnesses'
testimony. He added that allegations of police influence on other
prosecution witnesses were ``absurd.''
   He gave the defendants until July 19 to challenge the death
sentences in the Appellate Court, which had upheld his decision not
to reopen the trial.
   Some South African commentators have suggested the intense
international campaign on behalf of the defendants makes it more
difficult for Botha to grant clemency because he may appear to be
giving in to foreign pressure.
   Joyce Mokgesi, whose brother Francis is one of those condemned,
met with Mrs. Thatcher on Tuesday. She promised that to make
another appeal for clemency if the high court upholds the death
sentences.
   Mrs. Thatcher said leaders of the European Economic Community
and the world's seven major industrialized nations would join the
appeal.
   The defendants were convicted under laws passed by the South
African Parliament, which has no black representation, and
sentenced by a judicial system that excludes black judges.
   Botha added to the controversy by saying last March he could not
grant clemency because he did not want to interfere in the judicial
process. A few days later, however, he stopped the trial of six
South African soldiers accused of causing the death of a black
activist in South-West Africa, a territory controlled by South
Africa.
   In June, Justice Minister Coetsee told Parliament the president
had commuted 115 death sentences between 1983 and the end of 1987.

   It was nearly midnight when Michael Dukakis asked
the four advisers at his kitchen table for recommendations on the
potential running mates they had been discussing. The unanimous
verdict: Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas.
   ``That's my choice,'' said Dukakis.
   With that, the selection process that began June 8 ended.
Dukakis would ask the Democratic National Convention to nominate
Bentsen as his running mate in the effort to capture the White
House in November.
   A key figure at the table was Paul Brountas, the Boston lawyer
and former Harvard Law School classmate who headed Dukakis search.
After Bentsen's name was announced on Tuesday, Brountas described
what had happened.
   The decision made, it was decided to notify the Texas senator
immediately.
   ``We put a call in and there was no answer,'' said Brountas.
``We put a second call in around quarter to twelve and there was no
answer.''
   What they didn't know was that Bentsen was home but had turned
off his telephone because he had been getting so many late night
calls from reporters chasing the vice presidential selection story.
   At 6:30 on Tuesday morning, Bentsen was shaving when the
telephone rang. It was Dukakis offering him the No. 2 spot on the
Democratic ticket.
   Despite Bentsen's professed indifference to such an offer,
Brountas said that when he met with the senator in mid-June Bentsen
``indicated to me he would accept if asked.''
   The Dukakis adviser said that when he arrived at Dukakis'
Brookline home Monday night the decision was still open and that he
did not mislead Jesse Jackson when he told him Jackson still was
under consideration.
   Asked at a Washington news conference if he was angry, Jackson
replied: ``No, I'm too controlled, I'm too clear, I'm too mature to
be angry. I'm focused on what we must do to keep hope alive.''
   In Boston the night before, seated around the Dukakis kitchen
table along with Dukakis and Brountas were Kitty Dukakis, the
governor's wife; Susan Estrich, his campaign manager, and Jack
Corrigan, the deputy campaign manager
   During the primary season, Dukakis kept insisting he would not
begin thinking about a running mate until after he had clinched the
nomination.
   ``That was true,'' said Brountas, who said he tried to raise the
matter with Dukakis the night of June 7 _ the last night of the
primary season _ and was told to wait until breakfast the next
morning.
   Brountas presented Dukakis with a long memo outlining the
various considerations and then began the weeks of information
gathering.
   He said he gained the confidence of the 200 or so people he
consulted by describing himself as ``a committee of one'' who would
pass information only to Dukakis.
   He assembled a team of lawyers and tax accountants to
investigate the individuals who were the finalists for
consideration.
   Brountas refused to discuss the reasons any of the others were
not chosen over Bentsen except to say ``no one was eliminated from
consideration as a result of the background checks.''
   The day of the decision, Brountas flew to Washington to meet
with Jackson.
   His return flight was canceled by a thunderstorm, but he managed
to catch a later flight and arrived at Dukakis' home between 10:30
p.m. and 11 p.m.
   Meanwhile, Dukakis, looking unflappable, mowed his lawn in the
dark as he waited for his close friend and adviser to appear.
   As he methodically criss-crossed the yard with his push mower
night, the Massachusetts governor gave no hint how close he was to
ending the growing speculation over his choice for a running mate.
   But there were other signs that a decision was near.
   Newsmen clustered in front of the house on Perry Street saw
Estrich and Corrigan, join Dukakis inside the house.
   Meanwhile, Democrats were arriving in Atlanta to nominate
Dukakis for president, and the big topic of conversation was
speculation about his choice for a running mate.
   The name getting the most mention was that of Sen. John Glenn of
Ohio, the former astronaut who became a national hero when he was
the first American to orbit Earth.
   But the people who mattered the most weren't in Atlanta. They
were in Dukakis' home in Brookline.
   It was tight circle of five _ the governor, his most trusted
adviser Brountas, his two campaign aides, and his wife, Kitty.
   It had not been an easy day for Brountas, the Boston lawyer who
headed the vice presidential talent hunt.
   His principal order of business in Washington was a meeting with
Jesse Jackson, and according to one participant Brountas assured
Jackson he was ``under serious consideration.''
   As soon as their meeting ended, Jackson told reporters that if
offered the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket, ``I would accept
it.''
   But despite Brountas' assurances to the former civil rights
leader, one of the safest bets about the process was that Jackson
would not get that offer.
   In addition to Bentsen, Glenn and Jackson, the names on Dukakis'
list were Sens. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, and Bob Graham of
Florida and Reps. Richard Gephardt of Missouri and Lee Hamilton of
Indiana.
   Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia remained a subject of speculation
despite his insistence he wasn't interested in the job.
   Each of the prospects had a moment or two in the sun when rumors
flared that they were gaining favor.
   But each time Dukakis was asked about the latest rumors he
brushed them aside saying that only he and Brountas were qualified
to speak authoritatively, and they weren't talking

   Participants in a civil rights anniversary
march on Washington next month will be ``on the offensive'' to send
the presidential candidates a message, the Rev. Joseph Lowery said
Tuesday.
   ``It's not only a commemorative service,'' Lowery said of the
march planned 25 years after the landmark civil rights conclave
culminated by the late Martin Luther King Jr.'s famous ``I have a
dream'' speech in 1963.
   ``After seven long, hard, difficult years of opposing this
administration's efforts to dismantle affirmative action and
reverse civil rights laws, there is a need now ... to go on the
offensive,'' said Lowery, president of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, the organization once headed by King.
   ``This march is an opportunity for people to ... convince the
leaders of this incoming administration, whomsoever they may be,
that the top priority items must be full employment and adequate
wages,'' he said.
   ``We think it's important on this the 25th anniversay of the
dream to come to Washington and say not only that we still have a
dream but we have the determination to see the dream through,''
Lowery said.
   Lowery and King's widow, Coretta Scott King are the co-convenors
of the march, which has more than 80 supporting civil rights, human
rights, women's, religious and labor organizations.
   Five years ago, Mrs.King and Lowery headed up the New Coalition
of Conscience, which brought more than 500,000 marchers to the base
of the Lincoln Memorial in a 20th anniversary demonstration.
   He said invitations will be extended to the presidential
nominees of both political parties and the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson to
address the marchers.

<HEAD>Iran Lacks Votes For Condemnation; U.S. And Iran Said To Agree On
Delay</HEAD>

   The United States and Iran agreed to delay
a Security Council meeting on the downed Iranian airliner, largely
on Iran's initiative because it could not muster a majority for
condemnation, diplomats said Tuesday.
   A majority vote in the 15-nation council would force the United
States to use its veto to stop a resolution of condemnation. The
meeting, originally scheduled for Tuesday, has been postponed until
Thursday morning.
   U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters told reporters he did not
believe Iran had the votes to condemn the United States for
shooting down the airliner July 3 in the Persian Gulf. All 290
people aboard were killed.
   Walters spoke after meeting with Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar, who later conferred with Foreign Minister Ali-Akbar
Velayati of Iran. Velayati left the building without speaking to
reporters.
   ``I don't think it (a resolution of condemnation) was a matter
of serious consideration because I don't think they can get the
votes for it,'' Walters said in answer to a question.
   ``Everyone knows perfectly well this was not a premedidated act.
Everybody knows the U.S. is investigating. Everybody knows the
United States is a completely transparent country in which the
findings of our investigation will become known in a very short
time.''
   Perez de Cuellar spent more than an hour each with Walters and
Velayati, prompting speculation about an attempt to bring the sides
together.
   The council meeting was postponed Monday night by Ambassador
Paulo Nogueira-Batista of Brazil, the president for July, after
consultations with the United States, Iran and other members.
   It is expected to hear speakers Thursday but the agenda is not
known.
   The official reason for the postponement was that more time was
needed for consultations and preparations.
   Officials also cited the International Civil Aviation
Organization meeting Wednesday in Montreal on the shooting down of
the airliner by the cruiser USS Vincennes fired a missile at the
civilian aircraft. The United States says the crew mistook the Iran
Air Airbus for an Iranian F-14 fighter.
   Diplomatic sources said privately both the United States and
Iran want to avoid a showdown in the council. They said plans for a
resolution apparently have been scrapped and delegates were working
on a milder letter from the council president that would be
approved by concensus.
   Iran had said it wants the council to condemn the U.S. military
action, demand withdrawal of all U.S. forces from the Persian Gulf
and call for reparations.
   The sources said the United States effectively preempted Iran in
the Security Council by offering compensation to families of the
victims and by expressing deep regret.
   Any resolution condemning the United States was expected to be
vetoed by the United States, Britain and France. The other two
permanent members of the council, who also have veto power, are the
Soviet Union and China.
   Current non-permanent members of the council are Algeria,
Argentina, Brazil, Italy, Japan, Nepal, Senegal, West Germany,
Yugoslavia and Zambia.

   Texan Lloyd Bentsen said Tuesday that his
great-great-uncle Henry Wilson of Massachusetts did something that
``sounds like a good idea to me'' _ after serving many years in the
U.S. Senate, Wilson was elected vice president.
   ``I'm delighted to be back in a state where my great-great-uncle
was a senator from Massachusetts and became vice president of the
United States of America, and we're out to duplicate that record
today,'' Bentsen said after being picked by Democratic presidential
nominee-to-be Michael Dukakis as his vice presidential running mate.
   Wilson, who helped found the Republican Party, was the nation's
18th vice president; Bentsen wants to become the 44th.
   Bentsen, a Democratic senator from Texas since Jan. 3, 1971,
mentioned his Massachusetts relative in his remarks Tuesday but
didn't identify him. Bill Maddox, a spokesman for Bentsen,
confirmed that Bentsen was related to Wilson but did not know the
lineage.
   Wilson, a staunch abolitionist, was a Republican senator from
Massachusetts from Jan. 31, 1855, until he resigned March 3, 1873,
to become vice president during President Ulysses S. Grant's second
administration. Wilson, who had been elected in 1872 on the GOP
ticket with Grant, died in office on Nov. 22, 1875, in Washington,
D.C., at age 63.
   Wilson's portrait is in the state Senate's reading room. After
addressing the state Senate on Tuesday, Dukakis, the governor of
Massachusetts; Bentsen and Bentsen's wife, Beryl Ann, went into the
reading room to view the portrait.
   In remarks to the Massachusetts House, Bentsen noted his
great-great-uncle's many years of service in the U.S. Senate _ just
like Bentsen _ and that he went on to become vice president. He
said that ``sounds like a good idea to me.''
   Wilson was born Jeremiah Jones Colbaith in Farmington, N.H. in
1812, and later legally changed his name to Henry Wilson. He moved
to Natick, Mass., in 1833 and worked as a shoe manufacturer and
teacher before entering politics. He owned and edited a Boston
newspaper and served in the Massachusetts House and the state
Senate.
   He ran unsuccessfully for governor of Massachusetts in 1853 as a
free-soil candidate. In the U.S. Senate, Wilson was chairman of the
Military Affairs Committee during the Civil War. He was implicated
in the Credit Mobilier political scandal of 1872; Congress
reprimanded two congressmen in the case, but not Wilson.

   The Soviet Foreign Ministry on Tuesday told the
U.S. ambassador and a Pakistani envoy that Pakistan's harboring of
a rival Afghan government violates the international agreement on
Afghanistan.
   Afghan rebel groups based in Pakistan announced last month the
creation of a government and demanded the ouster of President
Najib, the pro-Soviet Afghan leader.
   First Deputy Foreign Ministry Yuli M. Vorontsov called U.S.
Ambassador U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock and Pakistani Charge
d'Affairs Samuel T. Joshua to his offices for separate meetings,
ministry spokesman Vadim Perfilyev said. It was not a threat of
possible Soviet military retaliation, Perfilyev added.
   It was the latest in a series of statements by the Soviets
denouncing Pakistan, where most of the Moslem guerrillas fighting
Afghanistan's Marxist government have bases.
   Perfilyev said at a news briefing that the ministry's statement
is ``made for the sole purpose of showing to the government of
Pakistan and to public opinion the vital need to implement the
agreements.''
   The U.N.-mediated Afghan agreement, signed April 14 in Geneva,
commits the Soviet Union to begin withdrawing its more than 100,000
military personnel from Afghanistan. The Soviet withdrawal began
May 15 and is to be completed within 10 months.
   The accords also commit Pakistan and Afghanistan not to
interfere in each other's affairs. The United States and the Soviet
Union are listed as guarantors of the agreement. The Moslem rebels
did not sign the pact.
   In Afghanistan, reports said there was fighting around three
provincial cities.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to help the
government battle the rebels, who have received support from
Pakistan and the United States.
   Perfilyev said Vorontsov told Joshua that the creation of a
transitional Afghan government on Pakistani soil is a violation of
the Geneva agreement. He reported Vorontsov as saying: ``The
consequences of the violations will be borne by the Pakistani side
totally.''
   Perfilyev added, ``Imagine the situation where somebody tried to
form an American government outside the territory of the United
States, for example, in Canada.''
   Mohammed Anwar, an employee at the Pakistani Mission, said
Joshua had been called to the Foreign Ministry by Vorontsov, but
Anwar said he could not disclose what happened at the meeting.
   Vorontsov also delivered a ``verbal note'' to Matlock in a
separate meeting, complaining of the ``new destructive action'' by
Pakistan, Perfilyev said.
   U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Marguerite Squire said the meeting had
occurred but the embassy did not comment on diplomatic discussions.
   Perfilyev said Vorontsov told Matlock that Pakistani actions
violate the Afghan accords and the Kremlin hoped Washington would
do everything in its power ``to influence Pakistan to end its
interference in Afghan affairs and abide by its Geneva
obligations.''
   In an interview published Sunday, the Soviet commander in
Afghanistan said the withdrawal timetable for his troops could be
affected.
   ``We are prepared to continue to implement strictly and
faithfully the provisions of the Geneva agreements,'' Lt. Gen.
Boris Gromov told the Krasnaya Zvezda newspaper.
   ``Although I do not rule out that unceasing violations of the
provisions by Pakistan may lead ... to a situation when appropriate
conclusions will be made as regards the timetable of the troop
withdrawal,'' he was quoted as saying.
   In Islamabad, Pakistan, Western diplomatic sources said fighting
continued for control of provincial and district capitals, but the
guerrillas were not occupying the cities because of retaliatory
bombings and shelling by Soviet and Afghan groops.
   Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, leader of one of the Afghan resistance
parties with headquarters in Pakistan said, ``We can keep the
cities but at the price of heavy casualties.''
   Rebel leaders reported their forces seized and then withdrew
from the capitals of Zabul and Wardak provinces. Afghanistan's
second largest city of Kandahar, 310 miles southwest of the capital
of Kabul, has been under siege for two months and Western diplomats
said the government is warning residents against cooperating with
the guerrillas.

<TEXT>
   The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee
approved legislation Tuesday that would change the oft-criticized
federal budget process by putting it into a two-year cycle.
   The measure would appear to have lttle chance of being enacted
this year. The proposal is a controversial one, and Congress has a
short schedule this year because of the presidential and
congressional elections.
   Under the bill, which was approved by a 9-0 vote, the budget
resolution that charts the government's finances and the spending
and tax bills that flesh out those plans would cover two years.
Currently, those measures cover only one year.
   Congress would spend the second year of the new budget process
reviewing spending decisions.
   Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., the measure's sponsor, and his
supporters have argued that with the present single-year process,
Congress spends too much time bogged down on budget matters and not
enough time scrutinizing its fiscal decisions.
   ``It is not too much to ask that Congress and the executive
branch take one year in each Congress to ensure that abuse is
caught and dealt with before it becomes a public scandal,'' Ford
said in a written statement.
   Proponents also say that with Congress consistently passing
spending bills late _ well into the fiscal year for much of the
1980s _ federal agencies must operate in a state of confusion over
what their budgets will be. This makes planning for the agencies
difficult.
   Such legislation has been introduced in the past. It
consistently runs into opposition from lawmakers who argue that
two-year budgeting would be too inflexible, making it hard to
adjust to sudden emergencies or changes in the economy's
performance.
   Members of the Budget and Appropriations committees can be
expected to jealously guard their legislative turf against a bill
that would diminish their authority. The legislation now must be
considered by the budget panel.
   In addition, Democrats may want to wait to see how Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis, should he become president, would feel about
such an alteration to the budget process.

<TEXT>
   A federal report was optimistic when it projected the 1988 corn
crop would shrink by 2.04 billion bushels over last year and
soybeans would produce 250 million fewer bushels, state and private
crop forecasters said Tuesday.
   One private forecaster called the U.S. Department of Agriculture
report unrealistic and others said it was too soon to accurately
measure damage to crops from the prolonged drought gripping the
farm belt.
   The report released Tuesday said the corn crop may be off 1987's
production of 7.06 billion bushels by 26 percent at 5.2 billion
bushels and the soybean crop may drop from 1987's 1.9 billion
bushels to 1.65 billion bushels.
   Experts in Iowa and Illinois, the nation's top two
corn-producing states, stood by predictions their states could lose
half their corn to the extreme heat and drought.
   ``We could lose 50 percent and possibly more if we get an
extended period of high temperatures, low humidity and wind,'' said
Neal Harl, an Iowa State University economist.
   Larry Werries, director of Illinois Department of Agriculture,
said the federal projections ``are way too high'' if state
officials are correct.
   ``Maybe we'll raise that much corn nationwide, but Illinois
won't contribute very much,'' Werries said. ``We're worse off in
Illinois than they anticipate.
   ``We're not any better than 60 bushels per acre, which is half
of our average for the last five years.''
   Werries said the federal soybean projections may be closer to
the truth because the bean crop is not at as critical a stage as
the corn.
   ``They may be a little on the high side but with beans it's
harder to tell,'' said Werries. ``There's still some potential for
soybeans. We may be able to get three-fourths our normal crop in
Illinois.''
   In the deep South, which also has been ravaged by drought and
heat, Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Tommy Irvin said the USDA
projections represented a ``substantial reduction'' and were not
unexpected.
   ``The early corn has been absolutely devastated,'' Irvin said of
Georgia's crops. ``There are still prospects for (soybeans) to make
a good recovery.''
   Bud Frazier, vice president for Balfour, Maclaine Inc., a
commodities trading company, disagreed with the government's
predictions on corn.
   ``In all probability, the corn crop will be lower and the
carryover (surplus, predicted by the government to be 4 billion
bushels) will be lower. The corn figures, I think, we're going to
view with some skepticism,'' Frazier said.
   ``We're not supposed to do that with government reports, but I
don't think we can help it,'' he added.
   The USDA also predicted consumer food prices would be 3 percent
to 5 percent higher because of the drought, but Dan Basse, crop
analyst for GNP Commodities Inc. said those figures were too low.
   ``I think they're being too modest in their estimates of the
inflationary impact of the drought,'' Basse said.
   Illinois and Iowa also rank one-and-two in soybean production in
the United States.
   ``The more modest reduction in soybeans is in line with
expectations that soybeans provide a much greater opportunity for
recovery,'' said Harl.
   Minnesota, Indiana and Ohio officials said the national
projections didn't accurately reflect the situation in their states.
   ``I'd say we'll have about a 60 percent corn crop, an 80 percent
soybean crop and maybe a 40 percent wheat crop,'' said Jim Nichols,
Minnesota state agriculture commissioner.
   Dave Mengel, Purdue University agronomist, estimated Indiana's
corn crop loss at 30 percent.
   Kirby Hidy, spokesman for the Ohio Farm Bureau Federation,
called the federal report ``a little optimistic.''
   ``We would expect corn production in Ohio to be reduced by as
much as 50 percent,'' Hidy said. The projections of a 13 percent
soybean drop are probably accurate for Ohio, he said.

   U.S. Ambassador Richard Melton cited
Abraham Lincoln on tyranny as he left Nicaragua Tuesday, expelled
by the government with seven other American diplomats on charges of
fomenting domestic dissent.
   ``Lincoln taught us that tyranny never has moral
justification,'' Melton read from a prepared statement before
departing in a drizzle on a U.S. Air Force C-12 Turbo.
   ``It is my wish, and that of my government, that Nicaraguans
working together will find solutions to their problems which allow
them to fulfill their destiny living in peace as a free and
prosperous people in a democratic nation,'' he said.
   The U.S. Embassy said earlier that the expulsions were
``outrageous and completely without justification.''
   The embassy said Melton would travel to San Salvador or
Honduras, then take a commercial flight for the United States. The
embassy also said Melton traveled alone, not with five U.S.
diplomats as the state-run Voice of Nicaragua had reported, and
that the seven others will leave Thursday.
   The leftist Sandinista government on Monday expelled the eight
diplomats and told them they had 72 hours to leave the country. It
accused them of ``criminal acts against the Nicaraguan people.''
   According to the government, the eight were fomenting dissent
and helped organize a large anti-government demonstration last
Sunday that ended in violence.
   Some U.S. Embassy personnel attended the rally, but the embassy
said it was normal for its diplomats to maintain contact with
Nicaraguans.
   Also Monday, the government closed the Roman Catholic Church's
radio station, Radio Catolica, and shut down for 15 days the only
opposition newspaper, La Prensa. The actions marked a sharp setback
in democratic reforms made in recent months to comply with a
regional peace plan.
   In announcing Melton's departure, the Voice of Nicaragua said
sarcastically that ``many people of the Nicaraguan right and the
director of La Prensa, Violeta Chamorro, are crying at this time
because of the departure of their ambassador.''
   In Washington, President Reagan retaliated by ordering
Nicaragua's ambassador and seven other diplomats out of the United
States.
   The Nicaraguan government identified the other expelled
Americans as David Nolan, John Creamer, Hugh Simon Jr., Aubrey
Carlson, Delvin Junker, John Hope and Robert Murray.
   ``We are disposed to accept a new ambassador less addicted to
the psychopathic orientations of (Assistant Secretary of State for
Latin America) Elliot Abrams,'' Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto
said Monday.
   President Daniel Ortega said the decision was made so the United
States would ``learn to respect this country and its people.'' He
added Nicaragua was ``prepared to confront any type of American
escalation'' as a result.
   A U.S. Embassy statement said the ousters follow ``a series of
repressive actions directed against the political opposition, labor
and press in Nicaragua.''
   An Interior Ministry statement charged La Prensa with violating
internal security and national defense. It said the newspaper
incited violence and subverted public order.
   The headline of Monday's La Prensa was ``Sandinista Police Club
the People,'' reporting on Sunday's demonstration. It carried
another article headlined: ``Accounts of a Brutal Attack by the
Police.''
   The Sandinistas also claim La Prensa is the ``voice of the
CIA.'' The paper receives U.S. funding through the National
Endowment for Democracy.
   Radio Catolica's programming included Cardinal Miguel Obando y
Bravo's homily in which he defended ``the right of the people to
civic protest.''
   Grumblings against U.S. Embassy involvement in internal
Nicaraguan affairs began last week. Sandinista officials said they
had discovered a ``Plan Melton'' that sought to create an internal
front of dissident.
   The Sandinistas said part of the U.S. plan to destabilize the
government was put into effect Sunday in Nandaime, a town 40 miles
south of the capital. Fighting broke out between security forces
and some of the estimated 10,000 demonstrators.
   Sandinista newspapers ran a picture of Murray, one of the U.S.
diplomats expelled, at the protest with his fist raised.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Jan Hartman said the picture was taken as
Murray was summoning a group of Americans back to the cars to leave.
   The Embassy statement said U.S. diplomats ``maintain contact
with as wide a spectrum of Nicaraguan citizens as possible'' and
noted that such ``activities are the normal duties of U.S. Embassy
officials overseas.''
   The Sandinistas also have accused the United States of
responsibility for recent rebel attacks that violate the March 21
cease-fire. The government and the rebels, known as Contras, have
been at war for almost seven years. They signed the agreement to
seek a negotiated settlement to the war but the talks are at an
impasse.
   The Reagan administration has backed and trained the rebels
since 1981.
   The government had pushed ahead with a regional peace plan
outline signed last August by the presidents of Nicaragua, El
Salvador, Guatemala, Costa Rica and Honduras. It called for
democratic liberties, cease-fires and an end to supporting
insurgencies in Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador.
   As part of its compliance, the government had allowed the
reopening of Radio Catolica and La Prensa and permitted opposition
demonstrations, including the one last week.

   The Soviet Union on Tuesday launched its second
spacecraft in a week toward Mars in an ambitious program to unlock
mysteries of the red planet and its largest moon, Phobos.
   Orange flames flared in the night sky over Soviet Central Asia
as a Proton booster rocket sent the unmanned Phobos II vehicle on a
111 million-mile voyage to Mars. Arrival is expected in January.
   Soviet television showed a recording during its evening news
broadcast of the launch of Phobos II at 9:01 p.m. Moscow time (1:01
p.m. EDT) from a pad at the Baikonur Cosmodrome on the steppes of
Central Asia.
   Phobos I was launched last Thursday and the media said its
on-board navigation systems were activated the next day.
   Television showed flags of more than dozen nations, including
the United States, flying at Baikonur. The countries are
participating in the mission that is designed to send the two space
probes close to the Phobos moon and drop instruments onto the
surface. Scientists said the mission might provide clues to how the
universe was formed.
   They have said that if Phobos is an asteroid trapped by Mars'
gravity, as many scientists believe, the probes will be able to
study matter that is little changed since the infancy of the solar
system billions of years ago.
   The two Soviet spacecraft are to enter the gravitational pull of
Mars in January and fall into orbit just behind Phobos for a
three-month study of the Martian surface, atmosphere and magnetic
field.
   In April, the two craft will drop out of their orbit and swoop
to within 100 feet of Phobos' surface and release two 100-pound
``landers.''
   In one experiment, a laser beam carried by a lander is designed
to split off a tiny piece of Phobos' rocky surface and trap it for
close examination.
   One of the landers is expected to operate for about a year in a
stationary position, sending back data. The other is planned to
bound like a superkangaroo about Phobos in 65-foot leaps, gathering
and analyzing soil samples.
   Soviet scientists have said the Phobos mission is an important
step toward a manned flight to Mars, which they believe may be
possible early in the 21st century.
   Officials have placed the cost of the Phobos mission at $480
million.
   In the United States, NASA's Deep Space Network will provide
radio-tracking data to help the spacecraft locate Phobos, which is
only about 17 miles in diameter.

   A Coast Guard officer testified Tuesday that the
seized cargo ship Encounter Bay was loaded with 72 tons of
marijuana off Danang, Vietnam, in early June and that the
Vietnamese army was involved in the operation.
   Lt. Thomas Rogers, the law enforcement officer on the Coast
Guard cutter Boutwell, made the disclosure at a detention hearing
for the 18 crewmen of the Encounter Bay.
   The Coast Guard knew ``there was approximately 143,000 pounds of
high-grade Thai marijuana loaded off Danang, Vietnam, sometime
during the first 10 days of June,'' Rogers said.
   Asked by defense attorney Peter Mair what else he knew about the
loading, Rogers said, ``The only additional information I can
recall is that the Vietnamese army was involved.''
   Rogers disclosed the Vietnamese connection just before the
hearing was suspended for the day. U.S. Assistant Attorney Jerry
Diskin declined to comment on the disclosure after the hearing.
   ``I was shocked'' at the revelation, said Mair, attorney for
Anthony Gilbert Sayers, 53, of New Zealand, one of the crew.
   The Panamanian-registered ship was seized 500 miles off the
Washington coast on June 30 in what the Coast Guard said was the
largest maritime bust ever on the West Coast.
   The crew _ three Americans, one from England, one from New
Zealand and 13 from Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore _ have been
charged with intent to distribute marijuana.
   Defense lawyers have argued that the U.S. government can't prove
that the crew knew what the cargo was and that there wasn't
probable cause to stop the ship.
   The Encounter Bay carried documents showing it had left
Singapore on June 5 or 6, but Rogers said he didn't know whether
that was the vessel's last port of call.
   Rogers said he didn't know whether the crew got on board before
or after the vessel received its cargo, or whether documentation
found on board would answer the question.
   He also testified that he believed the crew members were read
their Miranda rights but that he didn't know whether the rights,
probably read in English, were understood by the crewmen from
Southeast Asia.
   U.S. Magistrate John Weinberg would not allow questions about
the Encounter Bay's destination, saying it was irrelevant to the
hearing, which was only to determine whether there was enough
evidence to schedule a trial.
   Attorney John Muenster, representing Terrance Albert Nolan, 36,
of the United States, said the question of destination was relevant
because the charges against the crew require the government to
prove that the ship either had left or was approaching a U.S. port,
or was in ``U.S. Customs territory,'' a term that neither he nor
Rogers could define.
   On Monday, Howard Weitzman, a Los Angeles attorney representing
crew member Samuel J. Colflesh, 31, of Philadelphia, said the ship
was in international waters when seized.
   ``A number of constitutional issues'' are at stake, including
``the right to go out and pirate a boat,'' he said.
   Also Monday, Muenster questioned whether intelligence collected
on the Encounter Bay had been acquired through wiretapping.
   ``We surmise there was wiretapping... and if the seizure of the
boat is based on wiretaps that were illegal, then the evidence ...
could not be introduced in federal court,'' Muenster said.

   The last of three inmates whisked by
helicopter from the state prison in a daring escape was back in
custody Tuesday, and so was the pilot of the chopper, who flew the
same aircraft in the movie ``Rambo III.''
   Convicted murderer Daniel Mahoney, 30, was captured in central
New Mexico Tuesday morning after a massive search in woods.
   The pilot of the helicopter, Charles Bella, originally had told
authorities a woman hijacked him in El Paso, Texas, and forced him
to fly to the prison south of Santa Fe.
   Santa Fe County District Attorney Chet Walter said Bella, 43,
and Beverly Shoemaker were charged Tuesday with three counts of
assisting escape and one count of conspiracy to commit escape.
   The two appeared later Tuesday before Magistrate Isaac
Archuleta, who set $100,000 cash bond for each. Bella pleaded
innocent and the judge automatically entered an innocent plea for
Shoemaker, who was not represented by an attorney. Walter also
filed complaints against the other two inmates who climbed aboard
the helicopter Monday morning, charging each with one count of
escape and one count of conspiracy.
   Bella was the pilot of the Aerospatiale Gazelle that swooped
into the prison yard, picked up the convicts and fled under a
fusillade of gunfire from guards in towers.
   Bella, Shoemaker and the three inmates all were arrested within
16 hours of the escape.
   Carrol Bella said her husband, who runs a charter flight
business catering mostly to television news crews and real estate
salespeople, told her and police he was hijacked at gunpoint by a
woman who had chartered the helicopter. She said her husband told
her the woman handcuffed his hand to the helicopter's controls and
forced him to pick up the three inmates.
   A close friend of Bella, Tony Mobley, told The Associated Press
in El Paso, Texas, that the pilot flew stunts in the movies ``Rambo
III'' and ``Extreme Prejudice.'' In ``Rambo III,'' the Gazelle,
modified to look like a Soviet Hind helicopter, is shot down by the
character played by Sylvester Stallone.
   ``It's a tough case,'' Walter said, adding there was probable
cause to believe Bella was involved in an escape plot.
   When the chopper was finally forced down at Albuquerque
International Airport, after a 20-mile aerial chase, Bella was
taken into custody while his story was checked out.
   Bella and Ms. Shoemaker, 41, were being held at the Santa Fe
County Detention Center. The inmates were returned to the state
prison.
   Moments after the helicopter left the prison Monday, a U.S.
Customs Service helicopter began pursuit.
   The fugitive helicopter landed briefly at a central New Mexico
airport about an hour after the escape, where Mahoney, Shoemaker
and Randy Mack Lackey jumped out. Lackey and the woman fled in
different directions, said Department of Public Safety spokesman
Dan Taylor.
   Police officers at the airport confronted Lackey as he tried to
get away in a stolen pickup truck, but officers shot him in the
shoulder and he was arrested, said Taylor. Ms. Shoemaker, who was
described by Taylor as Mahoney's girlfriend, was arrested later at
the airport.
   The helicopter, meanwhile, was involved in an up-and-down,
weaving chase through the skies over Albuquerque, from Los Lunas
south of the city to a small commuter airfield north of the city
and back south to the international airport.
   After some aerial jousting with the Customs Service helicopter
and a state police chopper flown by Maj. John Denko, Bella landed
at the Albuquerque airport. He was arrested there along with the
third prisoner, Francis Preston Mitchell, less than two hours after
the escape.
   Mahoney was serving a life sentence plus 60 years from
Hillsborough County, Fla., for second-degree murder and armed
robbery; Mitchell was serving a life sentence from Summit County,
Utah, for first-degree murder and Lackey was serving a nine-year
sentence for larceny from Curry County, N.M.
   Mitchell and Mahoney were being held in New Mexico under an
interstate compact that allows states to swap prisoners.

<TEXT>
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev urged a
rally of Polish and Soviet youth on Tuesday to return to the
lessons of Lenin and to join in Gorbachev's reform movement.
   Opposition activists claimed riot police attacked and arrested
steel workers in the southeastern town of Stalowa Wola. They said
the workers had threatened to strike during Gorbachev's visit. A
government spokesman confirmed a police incident but said there
were no major disturbances.
   Speaking at Krakow's Wawel Castle, the residence of Polish kings
and queens until the late 1500s, Gorbachev repeatedly emphasized
that Lenin, the founder of the Soviet Union, could serve as a model
in ``the era of the second world revolution since the birth of
socialism.''
   ``Lenin's life and struggle constitute a splendid example to be
followed by young people ... a lesson in pursuing one's goals and
being faithful to the ideal born out of love for people,'' he said.
   The speech was a vigorous defense of Communist ideology in a
country where fewer than 1 percent of people under the age of 35
have joined the party and where young people tend to long for the
material success of Western nations.
   Asking rhetorically, ``Has socialism fallen through?'' Gorbachev
answered ``No ... Not at all.''
   ``We have transformed backward Russia from top to bottom and
made a great power of it. And all that thanks to socialism. That
would have been impossible on a different road.''
   The rally came on the second day of Gorbachev's six-day trip to
Poland.
   The Soviet leader and his wife Raisa, who arrived in Warsaw on
Monday, flew to Krakow on Tuesday to tour the city, where Pope John
Paul II served as archbishop before he was named pope in 1979.
   Gorbachev visited a mountain home near Krakow where Lenin lived
in 1913 and 1914 while plotting the revolution that brought the
Bolsheviks to power in Russia in 1917. Gorbachev often cites
Lenin's pragmatic approach to economic reform as a precedent for
his own policies that encourage greater openness and
market-oriented reforms.
   In a day of sightseeing, he also went to the house where his
father, a Red Army soldier, was hospitalized during World War II,
visited one of the nation's most historic churches, St. Mary's, and
chatted with the people who were allowed onto Krakow's old market
square.
   Gorbachev's 20-minute sojourn in the 14th century Roman Catholic
church on the square was the first time in memory a head of the
officially atheist Soviet Communist Party went into a working
church.
   It reflected the lessening of the gulf between the party and
religion. In April, Gorbachev received the head of the Russian
Orthodox Church at the Kremlin, the first such meeting in at least
40 years and has promised a new law on relations between church and
state. Some churches have been reopened and confiscated church
property returned.
   Monsignor Jan Kosciolek of St. Mary's said: ``We went through
the main gate and we walked to the main altar. We talked about the
architecture and emphasized that it was the biggest altar north of
the Alps.''
   Kosciolek said Gorbachev signed the guest book. Reporters were
not allowed in the church during the visit.
   Activists with the banned Solidarity trade union movement said
police surrounded a church Tuesday where some workers took refuge
after the alleged attack Monday night in Stalowa Wola.
   They said an undetermined number of people were detained by
police and about 50 people had taken refuge in the church.
   A government spokesman, Ryszard Strauss, confirmed a
``conflict-prone situation'' at the church, but denied any
organized police attack. He said at least one person was detained,
and he could not rule out that some officers used clubs.
   The workers had threatened to strike during the Gorbachev visit
unless seven colleagues fired for leading a two-day strike in April
were reinstated.
   On Monday, Gorbachev told the Polish parliament, or Sejm, that
he is moving to set the record straight about Josef Stalin's rule,
including supporting a drive to erect a monument in Moscow to
Stalin's victims.
   But he indicated he is not yet prepared to accept Soviet
responsibility for the massacre of about 4,300 Polish military
officers in the Katyn forest near the Russian city of Smolensk
shortly after the outbreak of World War II.
   The Katyn massacre remains a festering sore in relations between
the Communist neighbors.
   The Soviet Union has never admitted responsibility for the
slaughter. Each officer was bound, killed with a single bullet
through the head and left to rot in a mass grave. The murdered
officers had been interned by the Soviets, who accused the Nazis of
the massacre.
   A joint study commission has been established to investigate
Katyn, but Gorbachev indicated Monday that he is not yet prepared
to draw any concuslions.

<HEAD>Rain Scattered from Texas to Delaware</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Showers and thunderstorms scattered rain Tuesday from Texas to
the Chesapeake Bay, dumping several inches of rain on parts of
Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Delaware.
   Rain was diminishing across eastern Texas after storms dropped
up to 6 inches of rain in the northeast part of the state during
the night. Still, College Station received over an inch and a third
of rain in the six hours ended at 2 p.m. EDT.
   Rain also spread into extreme southeast Oklahoma, much of
Arkansas and extreme northwest Louisiana. Overnight rainfall
measured just under 5 inches near Broken Bow, Okla., and over 4{
inches at DeQueen Lake, Ark.
   Showers and thunderstorms were widespread along a cold front
from southeast Missouri through Kentucky and the mid-Atlantic Coast
region, and from the Carolinas coast to southern Georgia and
central Alabama.
   Bridgeville, Del., received 2 inches of rain during the morning.
   Elsewhere, rainfall in the six hours ended at 2 p.m. EDT
included over 1} inches at Hot Springs, Ark.; around 1{ inches at
Jonesboro and Blytheville, Ark., and Danville, Va.; and around
three quarters of an inch at New Bern, N.C., and Charleston, S.C.
   Early afternoon temperatures were in the 70s or 80s across much
of the nation. It was in the low 90s in eastern Colorado and
western Kansas, from southern and north-central Texas to central
Louisiana and southern Alabama, and across much of Florida, while
temperatures approached 100 in the desert Southwest.
   Cooler temperatures in the 50s and 60s prevailed over the
Pacific Northwest and the northern Plateau, and it stayed in the
60s in the eastern part of upper Michigan.
   At 3 p.m. EDT, temperatures ranged from 56 degrees at Bremerton,
Wash., to 102 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif. The nation's low
Tuesday morning was 37 at Gunnison, Colo.
   Wednesday's forecast called for scattered showers and
thunderstorms throughout much of the eastern half of the country
from the upper Mississippi Valley and upper Great Lakes to the
middle and southern Atlantic Coast and the eastern half of the Gulf
Coast. Thunderstorms were expected to be most numerous over the
upper Mississippi Valley and upper Great Lakes. Thunderstorms also
were expected to develop in the afternoon over the High Plains of
Colorado and Kansas.
   Highs were forecast to be in the 70s along the Pacific Coast and
across northern Washington and Idaho into much of Montana; near 100
degrees over southwest Kansas and the Rio Grande Valley; and
between 100 and 110 degrees in the valleys of California and
southwest Nevada and the desert Southwest. The rest of the nation
was expected to have highs in the 80s and 90s.

<HEAD>Israel Inaugurates New West Bank Settlement, Vows More</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing Minister David Levy inaugurated a new
Jewish settlement in the West Bank on Tuesday and vowed others will
be built there despite the 7-month-old Palestinian uprising against
Israeli occupation.
   ``We hear the voices (of the uprising),'' Levy, a leader of the
right-wing Likud bloc, told Israel television. ``But we are the
ones who make the facts, and those are: Another settlement, another
highway, another house, another family.''
   These developments also occurred:
   In Nablus, the West Bank's largest city, army bullets hit two
Palestinians in the legs during a demonstration protesting the
death of 17-year-old Sares Anabtawi, who was killed by army gunfire
Monday.
   At a courthouse in Arab east Jerusalem, officials said about 30
Palestinians attacked police officers taking a handcuffed Arab
detainee to his cell. The officials said six officers were injured
and four people arrested.
   Palestinian witnesses said armed Jewish settlers beat four Arabs
and smashed the windows of two vehicles in the West Bank village of
Ein Arik, apparently in retaliation for the stoning of an Israeli
bus.
   The new Jewish settlement of Shima, near Hebron, is designed to
house 250 families. The first 15 families were to arrive Wednesday
and live in mobile homes until permanent housing is built.
   It is the first settlement to be established since the uprising
began in December in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
According to U.N. figures, 220 Palestinians and four Israelis have
been killed in the insurrection in the territories captured by
Israel in the 1967 Middle East War.
   Shima will be the sixth West Bank settlement to be built since
1984. Under a coalition agreement reached in 1984 between Likud and
the left-leaning Labor Party, which opposes a large-scale
settlement program, the number of new settlements was limited to
six.
   But the more than 100 existing settlements have been expanded
since 1984 at an overall rate of 1,500 housing units a year.
   Yosef Margalit, a Housing Ministry official, said fewer Israelis
are willing to move to the West Bank because of the violence.
   About 300 Palestinians gathered in Nablus' marketplace to
protest Anabtawi's death and hurled stones at soldiers, who
responded with gunfire and rubber bullets, according to witnesses.
   Officials at the Al Ittihad Hospital in Nablus said two
demonstrators, aged 22 and 23, were shot in the legs, two others
were injured by rubber bullets and two were treated for beating
injuries.
   Army officials confirmed the shootings and said two soldiers
were wounded by stones.
   The army later imposed a curfew on much of Nablus and two
adjacent refugee camps, confining 126,000 Palestinians to their
homes indefinitely.
   Police spokesman Alex Lapidot said the attack in Jerusalem
occurred as two policemen were taking a 25-year-old prisoner from
the courthouse to his cell.
   He said about 30 Palestinians tried to free the prisoner and
four other officers rushed to the scene to drive back the crowd.
One policeman suffered a broken hand and the others had minor
injuries, he said.
   ``Four of the attackers were finally subdued and arrested,''
Lapidot said. ``The others managed to escape.''

<HEAD>Pollsters On Bentsen: Helps in Texas, Unknown Elsewhere</HEAD>

<NOTE>EDS: New graf 3 with ABC-Post poll</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen will help the Democratic
ticket in Texas, but outside his home state he is virtually unknown
to most voters and may have little effect on the presidential race,
pollsters said Tuesday.
   Bentsen has scored low in polls on potential running mates for
Gov. Michael Dukakis. In a CBS News-New York Times survey last
week, only 3 percent of Democratic primary voters picked Bentsen
from seven choices.
   In an ABC News-Washington Post poll completed Monday, less than
one-half of 1 percent named Bentsen as their choice as a running
mate for Dukakis. The telephone survey of 1,100 registered voters
conducted July 6-11 had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5
percentage points.
   But Dukakis' choice of Bentsen likely was based on a more
practical measure than name recognition, pollsters said. Bentsen
gives Dukakis a shot to win Texas and its 29 electoral votes,
third-largest of any state.
   ``It's a high-risk technique. You've got to beat George Bush in
his home state,'' said Claibourne Darden, an Atlanta-based
pollster. ``If Dukakis can do that, George Bush will be whupped.''
   A statewide poll in Texas in mid-June had Dukakis trailing Vice
President Bush, who maintains an apartment in Houston, by 23
points. But when Bentsen was proposed as Dukakis' running mate, the
Democrats trailed by just 5 points.
   Adding Bentsen ``makes Texas a competitive state,'' said Brad
Coker of Mason-Dixon Opinion Research, which did that poll. ``If
there's a drawback, it's that Bentsen doesn't guarantee Texas. That
makes it risky for Dukakis.''
   Outside his state, Bentsen is unlikely either to help or hurt
Dukakis, barring any damaging disclosures, political pollsters
said. In the absence of controversy about a running mate, they
said, voters tend to focus on the top of the ticket.
   That was backed up by a Florida poll by Mason-Dixon, conducted
during the weekend, putting Bush 10 points ahead of Dukakis in
Florida with Bentsen as well as without him. Only with Sen. Bob
Graham of Florida as a running mate did Dukakis draw even with Bush
there, WPLG-TV in Miami reported.
   Generally, other than in a running mate's home state,
``Everybody says the choice can hurt but not help,'' said Harry
O'Neill, a pollster for the Roper Organization and president of the
National Council on Public Polls. ``Unless there's something really
negative, I don't think the vice presidential candidate matters in
people's minds one way or the other.''
   Bentsen thus far barely is in the public's mind. In a national
Gallup poll in mid-May, 77 percent of respondents said they had not
heard enough about him to have an opinion of him. Of the rest, 15
percent rated him positively, 9 percent negatively.
   Similarly, in a Harris poll in early May, Bentsen ranked fifth
of eight choices for a vice presidential candidate, far behind
leaders Jesse Jackson and Sen. John Glenn of Ohio. In the Gallup
poll, a gauge that took negative ratings into account put Glenn and
Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey on top.
   ``There are many other vice presidential possibilities that are
more popular than Bentsen,'' said Larry Hugick, a Gallup pollster.
``Basically the guy just does not have much name recognition on a
national scale.''
   Still, pollsters noted, many other vice presidential candidates
have been little-known _ Democrat Geraldine Ferraro in 1984,
Republican Spiro Agnew in 1968 and Republican William Miller in
1964, for example _ and Dukakis himself was unknown by 77 percent
of the public as recently as November.
   Where he is known, in Texas, Bentsen was rated favorably by 55
percent of respondents to the Mason-Dixon poll last month, and
unfavorably by 12 percent. Bush had the same favorable rating but
much higher unfavorables, 33 percent. Dukakis was rated favorably
by 39 percent, unfavorably by 29 percent.
   In his Senate re-election contest, Bentsen led Republican
challenger Rep. Beau Boulter by 60-27; even if Bentsen runs for
vice president and for the Senate at the same time, respondents
said, they would favor him by 58-27.
   Coker noted that the Texas numbers well may change, at least in
part because many Texans may not have taken the suggestion of
Bentsen for vice president seriously.
   Such apparently was the case with pollsters themselves. Hugick
noted that Gallup just completed a poll during the weekend that
tested two possible Dukakis running mates _ Glenn and Sen. Albert
Gore of Tennessee.
   ``We picked the wrong Southerner,'' he said.

   President Reagan on Tuesday ordered the
expulsion of Nicaragua's ambassador and seven of his diplomatic
colleagues in a ``return-the-favor reprisal'' for the ouster of
eight American envoys to Managua.
   At the same time, Reagan refused to rule out severing U.S.
relations with the leftist Sandinista government, saying it
``remains an option.''
   Reagan said the expulsion order would affect Nicaraguan
Ambassador Carlos Tunnermann and seven other diplomats.
   But Tunnermann also is Nicaragua's ambassador to the
Organization of American States and questions were raised as to
whether the United States, as host country, can legally expel OAS
envoys.
   At one point, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater indicated
that Tunnermann would be allowed to remain in the United States
when he said the envoy simply ``won't be ambassador'' to the United
States.
   But a State Department official said the administration has
every intention of revoking Tunnermann's visas and expelling him.
``He can scream all the way to the airport,'' said one official,
insisting on anonymity.
   Tunnermann went to the State Department for consultations late
Tuesday afternoon.
   Afterward, Tunnermann said the United States has no right to
expel a diplomat assigned to the OAS and said it was the first case
in OAS history in which a diplomat accredited to that body has been
ordered out of the country.
   But he stopped short of saying he would fight the expulsion
order, saying that he had to consult first with his government.
   Tunnermann said that Under Secretary of State Michael Armacost
had told him he had engaged in activities as OAS ambassador which
violate diplomatic norms.
   When Tunnermann demanded that Armacost present proof, he quoted
Armacost as saying, ``Well, some day.''
   Later, State Department deputy spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said
that Tunnermann had engaged in an abuse of his ``privileges of
residence'' of residence in the United States.
   She said that Major Pedro Sampson Mendoza, Nicaragua's military
attache who also was on the list of those expelled, was guilty of
the same offense.
   Mrs. Oakley declined to specify what abuses Tunnermann and
Sampson Mendoza had committed. When reminded by reporters that
Reagan had described the expulsions as retaliation, she said the
diplomats were being ordered out both as a retaliatory measure and
for the alleged abuses.
   Meanwhile, House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., said
that in a meeting that he and other congressmen had with Reagan,
national security adviser Colin D. Powell said U.S. Ambassador
Richard Melton recommended against cutting off relations.
   The latest flare-up in mostly icy relations that have existed
since the Sandinistas overthrew dictator Anastasio Somoza in 1979
prompted White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater to brand Managua's
expulsion order and political crackdown as ``black eyes for the
peace process.''
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, traveling in the Far East,
called Nicaragua's ouster of Melton and the other U.S. diplomats
action an ``absolute outrage.''
   And the State Department listed a series of actions, capped by
Monday's closing of La Prensa and Radio Catolica, that it said are
``directed against the political opposition, labor and press in
Nicaragua.''
   The expulsions came amid growing indications of a softening of
opposition in Congress to a renewal of U.S. military aid to the
Contra rebels seeking to topple the Sandinistas.
   Reagan, asked whether he was putting off a new move to get
Congress to approve military aid for the Contras, replied, ``We're
not waiting. We're working on that.''
   ``Maybe, now, some of the congressional apologists will get on
board now and support the Contras,'' said Senate Republican leader
Bob Dole of Kansas.
   House Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., an opponent of
Contra aid, said, ``It's going to have a damaging effect on the
opinion of the Sandinistas' performance in the peace process in
Congress.''
   ``I wouldn't say now that the Congress is going to vote military
aid, but it certainly strengthens the hand of the administration if
it seeks to get military aid for the Contras,'' Foley said on
CBS-TV's ``This Morning'' program.
   Michel said he could not understand ``those who have been
supporting (Nicaraguan President Daniel) Ortega and the Sandinistas
in the Congress, or at least tipping the scales in their favor
whenever they can.''
   ``In my judgment, it weakens their position. It strengthens
ours, and we ought to call them to task for it,'' he said.
   Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., a Contra aid opponent, said
that the Reagan administration decision to expel the Nicaraguan
diplomats ``just fans this problem and expands it.''
   ``The administration sees this situation as its best opportunity
in months to get back the military aid for the resistance in
Nicaragua,'' he said.
   Dodd said he was ``not surprised'' at Managua's decision to
expel the U.S. diplomats given the long hostility between the two
governments, but he termed the Sandinista government's closing of
La Prensa and the Catholic radio station ``a major setback.''
   ``I think it is a violation of the commitments they have made,''
said Dodd, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on
Latin America. ``... I think it's a victory for extreme voices in
Nicaragua and in Washington.''
   Congress rejected a $36.2 million package, which included a
proposed $3.5 million for a military escrow account, in February.
   In late March, it approved a $48 million bill providing only
humanitarian aid through Sept. 30, and only $17 million of that was
earmarked for the Contras.
   Supporters of aid to the Contras in the Senate have said they
will seek an amendment to the Defense Department appropriations
bill as early as this week to renew military aid.
   Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto said Monday that
Melton and seven U.S. Embassy aides were ordered to leave the
country within 72 hours because they were engaged in ``activities
complementary to the state terrorism the administration of U.S.
President Ronald Reagan is carrying out against Nicaragua.''
   The Nicaraguans said embassy officials were at an opposition
demonstration in Nandaime, about 40 miles from Managua, on Sunday.
   But a State Department statement said the United States
``rejects the Sandinista pretext for these expulsions.''
   ``The ambassador and the embassy maintain contact with as wide a
spectrum of Nicaraguan citizens as possible, including labor
groups, the press and the internal political opposition,'' it said.
``These activities are the normal duties of U.S. officials
overseas.''
   Reagan disclosed the U.S. retaliatory order during an Oval
Office picture-taking session with Sheik Saad Al-Abudllah Al-Sabah,
the crown prince and prime minister of Kuwait.
   ``I have told the State Department to send their ambassador and
seven comrades back to Managua,'' he said.
   Asked if was going to sever relations with Managua, the
president replied, ``No,'' then added that ``the other is a
possibility always that we could do, but we'll just return those
individuals.''
   ``In other words, we're going to return the favor,'' Reagan
said. ``We're going to do to him what he did to us.''
   In addition to Tunnermann and Sampson Mendoza, the other
Nicaraguans being expelled are Maureen Sampson, Manuel Cordero,
Sofia Clark D'Escoto, Orlando Martin Vega Gutierrez, Zelmira Garcia
and Angel Arce.
   The Nicaraguan diplomats were being given 72 hours to leave the
country.
   The U.S. responded to the expulsion of three diplomats in 1983
by closing several Nicaraguan consulates in the United States. The
U.S. diplomats were accused of taking part in an alleged plot to
poison D'Escoto.

   Rep. Gerry E. Studds, D-Mass., Tuesday called
a dispute over the current expansion plan for the San Francisco Bay
Wildlife Refuge a ``tempest in a salt marsh'' and ordered further
examination of the proposal.
   Studds' comments came at a hearing of the Subcommittee on
Fisheries and Wildlife Conservation and the Environment which
examined a proposal to double the size of the refuge.
   The 21,662 acre tract of land and water was set aside by
Congress 16 years ago to protect remnant tidal wetlands and their
indigenous species at the south end of San Francisco Bay in
northern California.
   Last December President Reagan signed into law, legislation
authorizing additional appropriations to complete acquisition of
the original bondaries of the refuge.
   But administration officials Tuesday opposed the purchase of
20,850 acres of ``seasonal wetlands'' and ``salt ponds.''
   The administration ``does not believe additional land purchases
are warranted at this time,'' especially in light of the $13.1
million already spent on land acquisition, said William F. Hartwig
of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
   Paul Shepherd, vice president and land manager of Leslie Salt,
which owns 85 percent of the land slated for purchase, argued that
landowners were not told of the proposed annexation until they saw
their property on a map.
   Although the legislation states that additions to the refuge may
only be acquired from willing sellers, Shepherd said this type of
notice was ``tantamount to having a federal lein on the property.''
   But Mayor Gus Morrison of Fremont, Calif. supported the
legislation saying the so-called ``condemnation'' clause which
outlines how the land purchases must be made solves many of the
problems cited by opponents.
   However Newark, N.J. Mayor David W. Smith noted that the
expansion plans would absorb almost half of his city's land,
including a section earmarked for industrial development by city
planners.
   ``Newark's residential development is virtually in place. We
need additional industrial development to complement it,'' he said.
``One section (scheduled for purchased) is 44 percent of my city.
   ``Anytime the federal government draws a line on a map and says
this is what we designate as a refuge,'' Smith added, ``that land
becomes holy ground and it becomes impossible to develop it for any
other prupose in the San Francisco Bay area.''
   ``I think he's wrong,'' Morrision said of Smith. ``I just have
failed in convincing him, and I don't know why. If he keeps rigid
control over how the land is used he won't have any trouble.
   ``Like the chairman said, it's just a tempest in a salt marsh,''
Morrison said.

   Authorities said Tuesday the terrorists
who attacked a Greek cruise ship may have been pro-Iranian Arabs
trying to hijack it, and released photographs of three men and a
woman allegedly involved.
   The terrorists, who apparently boarded as passengers, fired
automatic weapons and hurled grenades Monday on the City of Poros,
which was taking 471 foreign tourists on a one-day cruise through
the Greek islands.
   City coroner Manolis Nonas reported 10 people dead and harbor
officials said another body had been found, but the Merchant Marine
Ministry put the toll at nine dead and 98 injured. There was no
explanation for the discrepancies in the death count.
   Several survivors and a harbor official said Tuesday the
attackers joined fleeing passengers in jumping from the ship and
were picked up with them by vessels that rushed to aid the City of
Poros.
   Two French survivors, not identified, appeared on state
television and one said: ``We saw them jumping out of the ship, and
a number of other passengers said they saw the terrorists aboard
the rescue boats going to Piraeus.''
   Police had said Monday night the terrorists escaped on a waiting
speedboat. Police officials would not comment about the reports
Tuesday.
   Officials also made conflicting statements about the number of
people involved in the attack, for which no group has claimed
responsibility.
   A senior officer of the Piraeus Harbor Authority said the attack
might be linked to the trial in Piraeus, scheduled for this week,
of Mohammed Rashid, a Palestinian wanted by the United States in
the 1982 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Hawaii. The officer spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   ``We theorize they were going to seize the ship together with
the people who died in the car explosion, maybe to force the
freeing of the Palestinian on trial'' the officer said.
   Anastasios Sehiotis, minister of public order, released the
photos and told reporters: ``These pictures are being circulated to
all airports, harbors and border entry points. These people were
involved with yesterday's attack.''
   Sehiotis also indicated an explosion earlier Monday that killed
two men in a car was linked to the ship attack. The car blew up
near the Trocadero Marina, home dock of the City of Poros, and the
ship was attacked about six hours later, at 8:40 p.m.
   The minister would give no further information except for the
names of ``two Lebanese men being sought as involved in this
attack.''
   He identified them as Hamoud Abdul Hamid, 36, who rented the
car, and Mohammed Zozad, 21, thought to be one of the men on the
ship. Sehiotis said both had been in Greece since May.
   The two other men were not identified and it was not clear
whether they were on the ship. The woman in the photo was not
identified, but the picture appeared to have been taken aboard the
vessel.
   Survivors said they saw three attackers, one masked with a
stocking, fire at people on the ship and hurl several hand
grenades. The explosions started a fire that brought the sun deck
crashing down on passengers in the lounge below.
   But the Piraeus Harbor Authority officer said he believed the
attack was carried out by two men and two women who boarded the
cruise ship when it called at the island of Aegina.
   He said survivors identified Zozad in one of the photographs and
recognized the young woman in the other photograph released by the
ministry.
   ``One woman, we think, had a Moroccan passport and the other a
French passport. We think they found out about the car explosion
and decided to shoot up the ship,'' the officer said.
   In Paris, a woman was quoted as saying she was the mother of the
French woman identified in one photograph.
   The woman, who identified herself only as Mrs. Bismuth, called
the Agence France-Presse news agency and said she saw the picture
on the Tuesday evening news. She was quoted as saying her daughter,
Isabelle, 21, was a secretary vacationing in Greece and not a
terrorist. Mrs. Bismuth said she hasn't heard from her daughter
since the attack, the agency reported.
   A spokesman for the Merchant Marine Ministry said 23 people
remained hospitalized Tuesday.
   Seven Americans were on the cruise, but none was among the
injured, the spokesman said. Greek state-run TV said an American
identified as Carl Johns was killed, but the U.S. Embassy said they
were unaware of any such person.
   Palestinian terrorists hijacked the Italian cruise ship Achille
Lauro during a Mediterranean cruise in October 1985 and killed a
69-year-old American passenger, Leon Klinghoffer. Italian courts
convicted seven Palestinians.
   Rashid, 34, was scheduled for trial Wednesday on charges of
entering the country with a forged passport, but prison officials
said it would be postponed because of a nationwide work slowdown by
prison guards. The government says it is considering a U.S.
extradition request for Rashid.
   U.S. officials say Rashid put a bomb on a Pan Am plane that
exploded on a Tokyo-Honolulu flight in April 1982, killing a
Japanese teen-ager and wounding 15 people. He was arrested at the
Athens airport June 1.
   Police said the car that exploded contained automatic weapons,
hand grenades and ammunition and a large amount of explosives.
   A police spokesman, speaking privately, said an Iranian magazine
also was found in the wreckage. He said a Beretta automatic pistol
and fragments of Soviet-made hand grenades found on the City of
Poros ``were identical with weapons recovered from the car
wreckage.''
   The Merchant Marine Ministry said only two of the bodies had
been identified _ Antonis Demaizis, 45, the ship's first mate, and
Klaus Johan Grabas, a 33-year-old Danish tourist. The ship carried
22 crew members.

   A Soviet soldier who deserted in Afghanistan five
years ago, went to the United States and was jailed when he
returned to the Soviet Union, has been freed, Tass reported Tuesday.
   The state-run news agency said Nikolai Ryzhkov was released from
a labor camp under an amnesty announced on July 4 for soldiers who
turned against their country during the Soviet army's 8{-year
intervention in Afghanistan.
   In a January 1985 dispatch, Tass said that after Ryzhkov
deserted, he was drugged, nearly starved and visited by lovers of
both sexes with CIA links in an attempt to get him to make
anti-Soviet statements.
   Tass said at that time that Ryzhkov left a military construction
unit in Afghanistan in June 1983, was brought to Pakistan by rebels
and given three choices: slander the Soviet Union in the West; be
executed, or be sent to the Soviet Union where, as a deserter he
was told, no mercy would be shown.
   At a New York news conference in 1984, Ryzhkov said he deserted
because he was tired of the ``dirty war'' in Afghanistan, where
Soviet troops battled anti-Marxist rebels.
   In December 1984, he went to the Soviet Embassy and asked to go
home. His request was granted. Tass did not say then what became of
Ryzhkov, but on Tuesday it quoted a report in the weekly newspaper
Literaturnaya Gazeta that he was in a labor camp.
   Ryzhkov told the newspaper ``he felt much easier in a (labor)
colony than in alien America, that he felt calm,'' according to
Tass.
   The newspaper wrote that Ryzhkov's release shows fear of
punishment should not deter Soviet deserters from returning home.
   Soviet solders entered Afghanistan in December 1979, replaced
one pro-Soviet government with another and stayed in the country to
help fight Islamic insurgents. The troops began withdrawing May 15.

   A group of local Christian leaders
appealed to Universal Studios Tuesday to destroy the film ``The
Last Temptation of Christ,'' saying it portrays Jesus as a
``mentally deranged and lust-driven man.''
   ``It is the most serious misuse of film craft in the history of
filmmaking,'' the Rev. Lloyd John Ogilvie, senior pastor of the
First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood, said at a news conference
attended by four other prominent area Christians.
   Members of the group acknowledged they have not seen the movie,
but said they believed the film contains a dream sequence in which
Christ comes off his cross and has sex with Mary Magdalene.
   Universal reaffirmed it would release the film this fall. It
said the Christians were advocating censorship and were criticizing
a film after declining an invitation to see it.
   ``Consequently, much of what they are saying is inaccurate and
exaggerated,'' said a statement released by co-distributors
Universal Pictures and Cineplex Odeon Films.
   The studio has billed ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' as a
look at the human side of Jesus. The movie is directed by Martin
Scorsese, who once studied for the priesthood, and stars Willem
Dafoe as Jesus, Barbara Hershey as Mary Magdalene and Harvey Keitel
as Judas Iscariot.
   Scheduled for release to a few theaters on Sept. 23, the movie
is based on Greek author Nikos Kazantzakis' 1955 book ``The Last
Temptation of Christ,'' which was condemned as heretical by the
Greek Orthodox Church.
   Universal held a private screening of the movie in New York
Tuesday.
   The Rev. Dave Pomeroy, director of media resources for the
National Council of Churches attended the screening. He said, ``It
was a fascinating film. It will certainly continue to engender the
kind of controversy it's already doing.''
   The movie, like Kazantzakis' book, shows Jesus tempted not to
die on the cross, Pomeroy said.
   ``The point that is being missed by the critics is that he
rejects that temptation to live out his life span and die as a
man,'' he said. ``What needs to be noted is this is a movie of a
novel not a movie of the gospel story.''
   ``I haven't actually had a good night's sleep in several weeks.
I wake up in the middle of the night and wonder, `How could someone
do this to the most wonderful person who walked the face of the
Earth?''' Dr. Bill Bright, founder and president of San
Bernardino-based Campus Crusade for Christ, said at the news
conference.
   The group asked Universal to cancel the release of the film and
destroy all copies of it, and urged Christians and non-Christians
alike to write or call MCA Inc., Universal's parent company.
   They said they were basing their protest on two versions of the
script they had seen and reports by an unidentified person inside
Universal Pictures who had seen the film.
   ``The content of both the script and the film portrayed Jesus
Christ as a mentally deranged and lust-driven man ... who in a
dream sequence, comes down off the cross and has a sexual
relationship with Mary Magdalene,'' said Larry Poland, president of
Mastermedia International Inc., a Highland, Calif., Christian
consulting firm.
   The Rev. Jack Hayford, pastor of the Church On The Way in Van
Nuys, joined Ogilvie in denying their appeal amounted to
censorship. He said Universal was altering factual biblical history
in the film.
   Universal Pictures had hired a born-again Christian marketing
consultant, Tim Penland, who advised on the films ``Chariots of
Fire'' and ``The Mission,'' to help ward off controversy.
   Penland resigned in June. He said Tuesday he couldn't finish
reading the script, which he called biblically inaccurate.
   The group said Universal had promised to show a rough cut of the
movie in June but canceled it. The group members said they declined
to attend Tuesday's screening because it was too close to the
release date to force any changes in the movie.
   Universal said in its statement Tuesday that Scorsese ``deeply
believes that this film is a religious affirmation of faith.''
   Marion Billings, a publicist for the director of ``Taxi Driver''
and ``Raging Bull,'' did not return phone calls Tuesday.
   On Monday, the group placed a full-page advertisement in the
Hollywood Reporter, an entertainment newspaper, urging Universal
not to release the film. The ad was signed by 61 Christians in the
entertainment industry.
   Also Monday, Poland called for a Christian boycott of any
product connected with Universal or MCA, an entertainment
conglomerate that includes movie and television production,
amusement tours of its studios as well as MCA Records and book and
licensing divisions.

   A woman who was accused of child neglect
after authorities discovered she had been tending her husband's
corpse nearly nine years has regained custody of her children.
   Knox County Judge Richard Porter restored Carole Stevens'
parental rights following a review of several psychological
examinations conducted on the children, a 17-year-old girl and a
14-year-old boy.
   Porter said the children could return to their mother's home,
where the mummified corpse of Carl L. Stevens was found Jan. 29 _
nearly nine years after his death.
   An autopsy revealed that Stevens, who was a diabetic, died May
12, 1979, at age 39. His brown and shriveled corpse was discovered
in the family home where Mrs. Stevens, 42, had kept it bathed and
clothed.
   Mrs. Stevens, a registered nurse, had tended the corpse with the
help of her two children and a house guest, Richard G. Kunce.
   Authorities said the family's beliefs in a holistic health cult
led them to believe they could communicate with Stevens through the
body and that he would return to life.
   On Feb. 1, Mrs. Stevens and Kunce both pleaded guilty in Knox
County Court to a charge of failing to report the death. Kunce
later changed his plea to innocent. They also were charged with
felony forgery.
   Mrs. Stevens was accused of fabricating a power of attorney for
her dead husband in 1984 and using it to refinance a home mortgage.
Kunce was charged with forgery for signing his name to the document
as a witness.
   Mrs. Stevens pleaded guilty to the forgery charge and was
granted probation. She was ordered to submit to psychiatric
treatment.
   In a separate civil case, Mrs. Stevens admitted she was guilty
of child neglect for allowing her children to live with the corpse.
The children were placed in foster care upon discovery of the body.

   Republican George Bush told blacks Tuesday his
presidency would mark ``a new day'' after the Reagan
administration, promising, ``I will be personally involved in
protecting the civil rights of all Americans.''
   Appearing before the 79th convention of the NAACP, the vice
president promised, ``You will be heard, I promise you that. You're
going to be called on. You're going to be partners in my
presidency.''
   Bush, sure to be the Republican presidential nominee, also paid
tribute to Jesse Jackson, the runner-up in the Democratic
presidential primaries.
   While saying he had profound policy differences with Jackson,
Bush said, ``I salute him for running the race, for being heard,
and he deserves a salute from us.'' The audience of several
thousand people applauded loudly, and generally gave Bush a warm
response.
   In his speech, Bush made no mention of the selection of Texas
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as the running mate of Michael Dukakis, the
presumed Democratic presidential nominee. Later, when reporters
asked for comment, he replied: ``That's interesting, that's what I
think about it.''
   The vice president's remark came as he traveled aboard Air Force
Two to Cincinnati for the Major League All-Star Game Tuesday night.
   Bush threw out the first pitch of the game. He took off his
jacket and dramatically threw it down near the mound, then wound up
and made his pitch _ almost over the head of Gary Carter, catcher
for the New York Mets.
   Dukakis was to address the NAACP on Wednesday, the day after
Bush did.
   Republicans traditionally have not had much luck in attracting
black voters. The Reagan administration has been criticized
repeatedly by blacks, particularly for its record on civil rights
and aid to the poor.
   Bush, however, has a relationship with many black leaders. In
introducing Bush, NAACP executive director Benjamin Hooks praised
the vice president's ``long and distinguished record of public
service'' and called him a man ``of honor and integrity.''
   Using a baseball analogy, Bush told the NACCP that as a
candidate for president, ``I'm not just in the on-deck circle any
more, I'm at the plate. And let me just say, it is a new day.''
   He promised that, ``I will have a positive civil rights agenda.
I guarantee you I will be personally involved in protecting the
civil rights of all Americans. This effort will be at the top of
the agenda of my attorney general, and he or she will be directly
accountable to me for results.''
   The audience respounded with applause and cheers.
   Bush said he did not intend to concede the vote of any American,
but acknowledged it's tough for Republicans to win over blacks.
   ``I need your help. I know I'll get your constructive
criticism,'' he said, amid chuckles from the audience. ``That's all
right. You will be heard, I promise you that,'' Bush said.
   Bush said his commitment to include blacks was was not dependent
on his receiving a certain percentage of the black vote.
   ``I'm a realist. You all are realists,'' Bush said. ``I'm going
to do better than people think in that regard.''
   He promised that ``I will have minority men and women of
excellence as full-scale partners in my administration.'' He said
black leaders like Hooks ``will always be welcome at my house, even
when my house is your house _ the White House.''
   Bush credited the Reagan administration with ``building a record
of economic success'' and said that a third of all black families
now earn more than $25,000 a year. ``But there's much more left to
be done,'' Bush said.
   He said the government can be involved in dealing with problems
such as pregnancy among unwed black teen-age girls and the high
rate of black school dropouts. However, he added, ``The answer also
lies in the values that are passed on from generation to generation
_ values like family, faith, education, the importance of work.''
   ``We must teach kids the difference between right and wrong. We
must teach them how to say no to drugs and no to teen-age
pregnancy. We must stop the cycle of babies having babies. And we
must emphasize the importance of family and work and education.''
   Bush promised that his first budget would seek a dramatic
increase in funding for the Head Start program.

<TEXT>
   Iran said Tuesday the terrorist attack on
a Greek cruise ship in the Aegean Sea may have been carried out by
the CIA to ``whitewash'' the U.S. downing of an Iranian airliner
last week.
   An Iranian Foreign Ministry statement, broadcast by Tehran
Radio, said the United States ``is confronted with a major
difficulty in the face of world public opinion and political and
international circles'' after its Navy shot down the Iran Air A300
Airbus on July 3, killing all 290 people aboard.
   ``In view of the nature of imperialism and its inhuman attitude,
it can be predicted that the American espionage network, the CIA,
and its agents may commit such unpleasant incidents in various
parts of the world in order to whitewash the disaster of the attack
on the Iranian passenger airliner,'' the statement said.
   Eleven people were killed and 98 wounded when three terrorists
opened fire with automatic weapons and hurled grenades aboard the
Greek cruise ship, City of Poros.
   Greek authorities on Tuesday speculated the ship attack may have
been carried out by pro-Iranian Arab terrorists.
   Iran's ambassador to Greece, Habibullah Biazar, denied the
speculation as ``a pack of lies.'' He spoke in an interview in
Athens with Tehran's official Islamic Republic News Agency.
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, quoted him as saying: ``We
categorically condemn such acts of terrorism against innocent
people which damage the interests of a friendly and peace-loving
country like Greece.''
   He denied that an Iranian magazine was found near the site of a
car bomb explosion Monday, six hours before the attack on the ship.
Two people were killed in the blast near Trocadero Marina near
Athens.
   He claimed the magazine was ``an Arabic one.''

   The building that will house President
Reagan's post-White House office is blown up by terrorists _ in a
new movie.
   Last week, officials of the Ronald Reagan Presidential
Foundation disclosed Reagan will have an office on the 34th floor
of Century City's fashionable Fox Plaza tower after he leaves
office in January. The foundation also has offices on that floor.
   The Reagans will live in nearby Bel-Air.
   Fox Plaza is the high-rise used by 20th Century Fox in ``Die
Hard,'' an upcoming movie that shows terrorists penetrating secret
entrances and air conditioning ducts, ``the real guts of the
building,'' studio spokeswoman Sharon Holliday said Tuesday.
   In the movie, the terrorists eventually blow up the building.
   The Secret Service, which will continue to guard Reagan when he
leaves office, wouldn't comment on the film or on any security
precautions, said a duty officer reached in Los Angeles, who
refused to give his name.
   In the movie, Bruce Willis portrays a New York policeman who
goes to Los Angeles to try to patch up his crumbling marriage. The
terrorists take over the building during an office Christmas party
Willis attends with his estranged wife.
   The movie is being released in major cities this weekend and
nationwide on July 20.

   Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young told the largest
black sorority on Tuesday that America's $152 billion trade deficit
can be blamed on the nation's failure to cooperate with business
people of different races around the globe.
   ``We have a trade deficit because we in big business are still
uncomfortable if the environment is dominated by people of color,''
Young told about 4,000 members of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority.
   ``If we are going to end the trade deficit without death and
conflict, it will be when blacks and whites, male and female, young
and old, Protestant, Catholic and Jew are able to work together,''
said Young.
   The ambassador to the United Nations during the Carter
administration urged members of the world's largest organization of
college-educated black women to extend the ``sisterhood and
teamwork you enjoy in this sorority to the sisters organizing mine
workers and domestic servants in South Africa.''
   Delta was founded at Howard University in 1913 and has about
125,000 members. It's holding its 75th anniversary through
Wednesday at the Civic Auditorium.

<TEXT>
   A South African official on Tuesday
reported rapid progress in meetings with Angolan, Cuban and U.S.
officials on a withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola and ending
South African rule over neighboring Namibia.
   As he boarded a ferry Tuesday morning for a second day of
private talks on Governors Island in New York's harbor, Neil van
Heerden, the head of the South African delegation, was asked about
the progress of the meetings.
   He replied they had developed ``further than Cairo and London,''
the sites of the previous four-party discussions.
   South Africa has said it would accept a U.N. Security Council
resolution calling Namibia's independence under black majority rule
once the estimated 50,000 Cuban troops pull out. Cuban troops are
fighting alongside Angolan government forces against U.S.-backed
anti-communist rebels.
   The head of the Angolan delegation, Gen. Antonio dos Santos
Franca, said of Monday's talks: ``It went well.'' He made the brief
comment while returning to his hotel.
   A news conference is expected Wednesday, according to officials
involved in the talks.
   The four parties first met in London in early May and then
reconvened late last month in Cairo, Egypt. South African and
Angolan officials held a separate meeting in May in Brazzaville,
Congo.
   The timetable for the withdrawal of the Cubans is probably the
most difficult unresolved issue, U.S. officials have said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   The U.S. goal is a full Cuban troop withdrawal in one year, the
same time span that the U.N. resolution sets for granting
independence to Namibia, also called South-West Africa.
   Angola and Cuba have insisted that the Cuban withdrawal should
take place over four years, but the U.S. officials believe that is
an opening bargaining position that is subject to change as peace
talks proceed.
   Angola has been convulsed by civil war since it gained
independence from Portugal in 1975.
   South Africa has repeatedly sent troops across the border from
Namibia into Angola to support the rebel forces known as UNITA, or
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, in their
clashes with Cuban and Angolan forces.

<HEAD>Grosz Appeals For Public Support of Stringent Economic Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungary's Communist Party and
government leader, Karoly Grosz, appealed on Tuesday for public
support of a stringent economic program and harshly criticized the
work of his government over the past year.
   ``What lies ahead are sacrifices for the sake of the future,''
Grosz said on an evening televisoin interview. He said it could
take 10 to 15 years for his program to show results.
   It was the first time a Hungarian government chief has evaluated
his first year in office.
   Grosz said he was ``very dissatisfied'' with the achievements of
the last 12 months despite the efforts to implement a program of
austerity measures and economic restructuring introduced last year.
   Grosz said the government, economic experts and individual
citizens ``have not been working efficiently enough.''
   The 20-minute interview was conducted on the eve of a meeting of
the party Central Committee that is to discuss two alternative
economic programs.
   One would push through radical reforms towards a more
market-oriented economy. This, however, could lead to 80,000 to
100,000 unemployed and result in greater social tensions. The
second would introduce changes more gradually.
   The party newspaper Nepszabadsag published details of the
proposals on Saturday, the first time the agenda of a Central
Committee meeting was published in advance in such detail.
   Grosz said economic restructuring would mean hard times for
Hungarians, as it aims to stop the growth of Hungary's foreign
debt, now totaling $18 billion, by 1990.
   The government this year introduced East Europe's first
value-added and personal income tax as part of its austerity
program. A value-added tax is a form of indirect sales tax.
   ``Parliament and the people are increasingly impatient, and
there is increasing social pressure on the government to do
better,'' Grosz said.
   He appealed to Hungarians to ``understand the need'' for the
program which will include curbs on imports, cuts in subsidies to
loss-making firms and bankruptcy proceedings for those companies
which continue to lose money. Unemployment already is to affect
about 50,000 people this year.
   Grosz said the leadership planned to push ahead with its program
``and is ready to face any tensions that might be involved.'' He
said steps will be taken that ``will strike hard at some sections
of society,'' but that he could ``not afford to be indulgent.''
   He said more attention should be devoted to industries with a
future, such as telecommunications and tourism.

   Caesars Hotel Casino agreed Tuesday
to donate $100,000 to two state hospitals as a precedent-setting
settlement in a case involving civil charges that the gaming hall
allowed a teen-age girl to gamble.
   Caesars will donate $50,000 each to the John F. Kennedy Medical
Center in Edison and Marlboro State Hospital in Marlboro, both of
which have facilities to treat compulsive gambling.
   The settlement involved a complaint that the gaming hall treated
a 16-year-old girl as a high roller, offering her complimentary
drinks, a hotel room, meals and show tickets.
   Debra Kim Cohen, now 18, pleaded guilty in January to underage
gambling and agreed to attend Gamblers Anonymous meetings as part
of a one-year probationary sentence.
   State Administrative Law Judge Stephen Thompson accepted the
settlement on Tuesday, calling it ``novel and creative.''
   Anthony J. Parrillo, director of the state Division of Gaming
Enforcement, said he was satisfied with the outcome of the
complaint, which also was filed against Caesars and four other
casinos. Elsinore's Atlantis, Resorts International, Harrah's
Marina and Trump Plaza casino hotels are expected to settle their
complaints by the end of this week, he said.
   The $100,000 settlement is the largest that a casino has ever
paid in an underage gambling offense. Prior to Tuesday's agreement,
casinos paid an average of $2,000 per incident, Parrillo said.
   Before the complaints were filed, Parrillo said, ``The problem
of juvenile gambling in this state went largely unnoticed, much
less treated and remedied.''
   ``Not only did the DGE complaint serve to elevate the industry's
consciousness of this serious problem,'' he said, ``but the
settlement we have struck today hopes to achieve some social good
by dedicating substantial monies to mental health facilities in
this state where compulsive gambling and other disorders may be
treated.''
   Lloyd D. Levenson, an attorney for Caesars, said the casino
acknowledged that in Miss Cohen's case, ``our security force broke
down ... which we have since tightened up.''
   Levenson said he was hired to attend municipal court hearings to
push for stiff penalties against underage gamblers who slip past
the casino's security guards.
   ``We want to send a message out to other young people,''
Levenson said.

<HEAD>Opals Traded Like Money In Big Gulf Coast Deals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A growing number of investors are using
opals like money on Florida's Gulf Coast, bartering the
semiprecious stones for Mercedes-Benz automobiles and real estate
sometimes worth millions of dollars.
   The opals have been used to satisfy all or part of the selling
price in these deals, and the sellers then use the opals in other
transactions, The Sarasota Herald-Tribune reported Monday.
   Some experts cautioned that it can be difficult, if not
impossible, to cash in on the appraised value of the semiprecious
stones, especially in large quantities.
   The exchange system has not yet resulted in large liquidations
of opals for cash, jewelers said.
   The opals ``take on the character of currency,'' said John
Daunt, a master gemologist and owner of Gemstone Corp. of America
in Sarasota.
   Gerry Manning, president of Manning Opal Co. in New York, said
buyers may be surprised when they try to resell their stones.
   Top grade opals have a worldwide market, but stones sold in
large quantities seldom achieve their retail value, Manning said.
   ``Very often, in my experience, the values are incredibly
overstated ... there is no secondary market for these stones,'' he
said.
   ``There is no place to convert them to cash,'' agreed Arthur
Heilsberg, a real estate agent who has been involved in
transactions involving opals.
   But he added, ``If the stones can be turned over in another
deal, who cares what they're all worth in cash?''
   When Frank Byars sold his troubled Tiki Gardens tourist
attraction in the Pinellas County city of Indian Shores, he
accepted $1 million in opals as part of the reported $3 million
package.
   Byars is reluctant to discuss the sale. Asked if he thought he
got a fair deal, he said, ``No, I can't sell them (the opals).''
   One local gemologist cited another deal, with an unnamed
purveyor of opals, in which a lawyer agreed to sell a Mercedes-Benz
for the semiprecious stones.
   Two Australians, Neville Schmidt and Darrell Roder, have
contracted to buy several millions of dollars worth of property in
Manatee and Sarasota counties using cash and opals as payment,
according to their trustee, Sarasota attorney Peter Jaensch.
   In one deal, Sarasota real estate investor Robert H. Jones sold
them a shopping center and an office building in Bradenton for
millions in cash and opals.
   Schmidt and Roder purchased the office building for $660,000 _
half in cash, half in opals, according to Heilsberg, an agent with
VPN General Realty who handled the transaction.
   He said the Australians are trading black opals, which they
obtain from a mine they own in Australia.
   Janet Post, owner of Janet F. Post Jewelry & Antiques in
Sarasota, said she has appraised the Australians' opals ``dozens
and dozens of times.''
   Post has provided what she called ``retail replacement''
appraisals to her clients, who pay her $50 an hour. That appraisal
judges what a stone would be worth if it were bought at a retail
jewelry store, set in jewelry. These types of appraisals are most
commonly used to value a stone for insurance purposes.
   ``An average per carat (price) for a fine stone has been from
$250 to $1,500 per carat,'' Post said.
   She said she has never provided or been asked to provide ``a
fair market value'' for the opals, or what they would be worth if
turned into cash.

   Jesse Jackson said Tuesday he was ``too
controlled ... too mature'' to be angry about being passed over for
the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket.
   But in an emotional speech to the NAACP Tuesday night, hours
after Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas was tapped as Michael Dukakis'
running mate, Jackson shouted out a message of pride and defiance.
   ``I will never surrender!'' he said as the crowd cheered and
surged to its feet. ``One thing I know, I may not be on the ticket,
but I'm qualified! That's what I know! Qualified!''
   Dukakis was to address the NAACP convention on Wednesday.
   Earlier Tuesday, Jackson, who learned from reporters about
Dukakis' choice of Bentsen, refrained from rendering any explicit
judgment on the selection of the Texas senator for the spot Jackson
himself coveted.
   ``Since I have had no opportunity for in-depth discussion with
Senator Bentsen and have had no prior discussion with Governor
Dukakis about his recommendation, it would be inappropriate for me
to comment upon it,'' Jackson told a crowded news conference.
   Asked if he was angry, the civil rights leader said, ``No, I'm
too controlled, I'm too clear, I'm too mature to be angry. I'm
focused on what we must do to keep hope alive. Anger reflects a
crisis in emotions and therefore irrational behavior. I've simply
been in this struggle long enough to keep my eyes on the prize.''
   But the disappointment was palpable for Jackson, who 24 hours
earlier had sat for a two-hour interview with Paul Brountas, the
Dukakis campaign chairman who led the search for a vice president.
   Although Jackson had specifically told Brountas where he was
staying in Cincinnati Monday night and what time he was leaving to
return to Washington, Dukakis did not reach Jackson by telephone
until an hour after reporters informed Jackson as he landed in
Washington.
   Even as Jackson was leaving the airport, Bentsen was there
preparing to board a private plane for the flight to Boston and the
announcement with Dukakis. Jackson and Bentsen did not meet.
   Jackson attributed the selection to a strategy decision by the
Dukakis campaign and said, ``My obligation is not to react to his
strategy, but to affirm my own. It is to keep hope alive, to keep
focus in our campaign, to keep our delegates and supporters
disciplined, detailed and full of hope.''
   Asked if he would encourage his supporters to enthusiastically
back the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket, Jackson said, ``We can only
address that after the nomination is over on Wednesday night.''
   ``I no doubt will support the ticket that the convention elects
next week. But that will be the appropriate time,'' he said, adding
that in the meantime he awaits further discussions on minority
planks, his role in the party and ``our strategies to win after the
nomination.''
   Asked if black voters might stay home in November, Jackson said,
``This is no time for us to proceed based upon threats. It is a
time to proceed based upon a shared commitment to expand
participation in the process.''
   Jackson said Dukakis had indicated he would discuss his choice
of a running mate with him beforehand, but apparently changed his
mind.
   ``But I wouldn't be unduly concerned about the various strategic
moves and@or mistakes another camp makes. We must keep our focus on
what matters at the convention,'' said Jackson, who predicted he
would have 1,300 delegates, or nearly 30 percent of all delegates
in Atlanta.
   ``For some people Atlanta may mean a ratification process, and
even coronation. For for others Atlanta means a chance to express
before the nation, their basic concerns about the rights of workers
and women and children and our quest for peace,'' he said.
   ``The convention for us is a serious culmination of many years
of very hard and serious work. ... Hopefully, when we leave there
we will be a unified party, a stronger party and will move on to
victory,'' said Jackson.
   ``If we have an exciting campaign in the summer, and these
grapes of hope remain buoyant and excited, then their juice will be
enough to stimulate us to victory in November. But if somehow, some
misguided strategists crush grapes of hope in Atlanta into raisins
of despair, they will not be able to bounce back in the fall,''
Jackson said.
   He said his own presidential campaign was not like that of
``those who ran but surrendered. ... My campaign never surrendered.
It continues to grow. It continues to expand. It's the heart and
soul of our party.''
   But other Jackson supporters criticized Dukakis's handling of
the announcement.
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said, ``I assume that Dukakis'
announcement was not made to make a special appeal to black folks.
... It was very unprofessional.''
   But Rangel said ``it would be premature to discuss what blacks''
or others are going to do. ``We are not walking away; we are
walking into the convention.''
   Rep. Mickey Leland, D-Texas, the head of Jackson's campaign in
Texas, said ``If in fact Rev. Jackson is not satisfied and not
aggressive in this campaign in the fall ... the Democrats are going
to have a hard time winning.''
   But Leland said the selection of Bentsen puts Texas in the win
column for the Democrats. ``That's a fait accompli,'' said Leland,
who praised Bentsen as ``a very effective legislator, a friend and
a colleague.''

<HEAD>Defense Minister Rules Out Halt To Low-level Military Training
Flights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Rupert Scholz ruled
out a ban on low-level NATO training flights Tuesday, despite
growing calls that such flights be drastically reduced or
eliminated after recent accidents.
   ``Low-level flights are necessary to maintain military security
and readiness,'' Scholz was quoted as saying in the illustrated
magazine Quick.
   Citizens groups have charged that in addition to being
dangerous, noise from low level-flights makes life in heavily
affected areas unbearable.
   Last week, the parliament of Rhineland Palatinate state approved
a non-binding resolution calling for an end to the flights.
   Scholz was quoted as saying he is looking for ways to sharply
reduce the number of military training flights within West Germany.
He said one alternative could be to require that pilots spend more
time in flight simulators.
   Another solution could be to expand the flight areas ``outside
the country.'' The Quick article did not elaborate.
   A military expert belonging to Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
governing Christian Democrat Party was quoted as saying other
options include asking NATO pilots to copy West German training
methods of descending to a low altitude only just before the
aircraft reaches its training target.
   Willy Wimmer also was quoted as saying in an interview with the
Augusburg Allgemein newspaper Tuesday that planners are considering
allowing fighters to use now-restricted airspace along the border
with East Germany.
   Wimmer said the restricted area, now 18 miles wide along the
western side of the border, could be reduced.
   Last week, a West German Air Force F-4 Phantom fighter jet
crashed and exploded in a field.
   Two weeks ago, three U.S. Air Force F-16s crashed in one day in
two separate accidents. One pilot was killed when two jets collided
in flight.

   President Jose Napoleon Duarte
resumed work Tuesday at his residence after returning from
treatments in the United States for terminal cancer, aides reported.
   ``The president is working at home,'' said an aide who spoke
with the condition she not be identified. She declined further
comment.
   Duarte, 62, returned Monday from Washington. He had been there
since May 31, undergoing medical evaluations and treatment.
   He was driven to the presidential residence after a brief
welcoming ceremony at the airport. Doctors have said he is
undergoing chemotherapy for cancer of the liver and his life
expectancy is 6-18 months.
   In a statement at the airport, Duarte said, ``I am here now to
reassume the presidency, in order to continue working for what I
most love _ democracy.''
   He vowed to continue the fight against leftist rebels ``in order
to bring peace to my people ... in that way I will make it to the
first of June and hand power over to the one who is elected by the
people.''
   Duarte's five-year term expires June 1, 1989.
   He is the leader of the centrist Christian Democrats, now
divided by two factions that have nominated candidates for the
presidency.
   His party's major opposition is the rightist Republican
Nationalist Alliance that won a majority of municipal and
legislative elections in March.
   Duarte is to return to the Walter Reed Medical Center in
Washington next month for additional treatment. Salvadoran
officials have said subsequent treatments could be carried out in
El Salvador.

   A French woman said Tuesday her daughter is the
young woman identified as a possible accomplice of terrorists who
attacked a Greek cruise ship, but she denied her daughter was
involved in any terrorism.
   The woman, identifying herself only as Mrs. Bismuth, called the
French news agency Agence France-Presse to say she was certain a
photo she saw on the evening news showing a woman playing cards
with a young man aboard the boat was her daughter. The picture was
distributed by Greek authorities as that of a woman wanted for
possible involvement in the assault.
   She said she had not heard from her daughter since the Monday
attack. Three gunmen on the crowded ship tossed grenades and fired
on passengers, killing 11 and injuring about 100.
   Mrs. Bismuth said her daughter, Isabelle, 21, was a secretary
vacationing in Greece since Saturday and not a terrorist.
   ``I saw the photos of terrorists and I identified my daughter as
the young woman playing cards on the boat with a young man,'' Mrs.
Bismuth said. She added that she was ``sure without a doubt'' this
was her daughter ``and she has no ties with terrorists.''
   The woman said she received a call Tuesday from Isabelle's
traveling companion who told her that ``she lost all trace of my
daughter at the moment of the commando attack. Since then there is
no news of her.''
   Meanwhile, a special plane carrying three French citizens
wounded in the attack arrived in Paris Tuesday night. A second
plane carrying four more seriously wounded French citizens was
expected later.
   The plane was met at Le Bourget airport by Edwige Avice, a
deputy minister attached to the Foreign Affairs Ministry, and by
Greece's ambassador to France.

   Former Teamsters president Jackie
Presser was eulogized at his burial Tuesday as a loyal friend of
the labor movement who was willing to face public scrutiny.
   Presser, who molded a large Teamsters local in Cleveland and
rose to the top job in the 1.6 million-member union, was buried the
same day a federal judge had set for his trial on labor
racketeering and embezzlement charges.
   Presser, 61, died Saturday night in Lakewood Hospital, near
Cleveland. Cardiac arrest was listed as the immediate cause of
death. He had undergone surgery for brain cancer in Phoenix in May.
   The entire executive committee of the International Brotherhood
of Teamsters, including acting president Weldon L. Mathis, attended
the traditional Jewish memorial service and funeral along with at
least 800 of Presser's relatives, friends and admirers.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a ranking member of the Senate Labor
and Human Resources Committee, commended Presser for being the
first Teamsters president to appear before a Senate committee.
   ``He wanted people to know that there were people in the
Teamsters willing to stand up and face the public,'' Hatch said.
``He believed in the labor movement, and he wasn't afraid to stand
up and say so. ... I chaired those hearings, and I know what he
went through.''
   Hatch described Presser as a powerful labor leader whose
accomplishments included bringing the Teamsters back into the
AFL-CIO.
   ``Like the rest of us, Jackie Presser made some mistakes, and
given the option to relive his life he would probably make some
changes. But wouldn't we all?'' Hatch said. ``I hope he will be
remembered for what he accomplished.''
   Cleveland Mayor George V. Voinovich, a Republican senatorial
candidate in Ohio, eulogized Presser as a major civic force.
   ``I will remember Jackie Presser as a man who cared about his
city. I will miss him and pray for him,'' Voinovich said.
   Presser was named as a defendant, along with the union's
executive board, in a lawsuit filed two weeks ago by the U.S.
government that seeks to place the union under the supervision of a
court-appointed trustee. A federal judge last week rejected a
Justice Department request to have a monitor police the union's
operations.
   At the time of his death, Presser was awaiting trial on felony
charges that he participated in a $700,000 payroll-padding scheme
at Teamsters Local 507 in Cleveland, a 5,000-member local created
in the 1960s. Presser remained as secretary-treasurer of the local
while running the national union from Washington D.C.
   His trial was to have begun Tuesday, but was delayed because of
his failing health. Co-defendants Harold Friedman, a Teamsters vice
president and Local 507 president, and Anthony Hughes, the local's
recording secretary, are to face trial Oct. 12.
   Presser claimed he was an FBI informant and that the FBI
authorized the hiring of ``ghost employees'' at Local 507.
   Mathis, the union's secretary-treasurer, indicated the executive
committee will meet Friday to discuss who should fill out the
remainder of Presser's term as president, which runs until 1991.

<HEAD>Jewish Leader Wants ``No Strings Attached'' East German
Reparations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Edgar M. Bronfman, head of the World Jewish
Congress, said Tuesday a ``good chance'' exists of reaching
agreement this fall on East German reparations to Holocaust
survivors.
   But he expressed some reservations about the East German
proposal during a visit to Berlin, and said payments must be on a
``no strings attached'' basis.
   He also called on Austrians to face up to their country's Nazi
past.
   Bronfman is on a three-day visit to West Berlin and West Germany
that includes a meeting with Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn.
   In 1952, West Germany agreed with the New York-based World
Jewish Congress to compensate victims of the Nazi Holocaust. Since
then officials in Bonn have paid out more than $48 billion to
survivors and their families.
   The Communist East German government had argued that because
East Germany came into existence as a nation in 1949, it had no
legal responsibility for the atrocities of Adolf Hitler's regime.
   More than 6 million Jews were killed during Hitler's Third Reich.
   Diplomatic sources at the United Nations, speaking on condition
of anonymity, have said East Germany's refusal to pay reparations
or accept legal responsibility for war crimes has been a major
stumbling block in improving relations with the United States.
   Then on June 8 the East German government announced it was
willing to provide ``humanitarian aid'' to Jewish survivors.
   The amount being discussed is up to $100 million, according to
West Berlin Jewish leaders. Details of the plan have not been made
public.
   Bronfman said of the plan Tuesday: ``We'll have to see what it's
hooked up to. ... It's not clear to me that it's as open-handed as
it might be. I just want to make sure that there are no strings
attached.''
   Asked if he doubted the East Germans' good faith, Bronfman
replied: ``No.''
   He confirmed he was invited to visit Communist East German
leader Erich Honecker and said he assumed the trip would take place
in the fall.
   Asked if he would conclude a reparations agreement with the East
Germans in the autumn, Bronfman said: ``There's a good chance.''
   The head of the World Jewish Congress praised West Germany for
its efforts to face up to the Nazi past, saying: ``It's a pleasure
to come to a country where you see what West German governments
since (Chancellor Konrad) Adenauer have done to discuss the
Holocaust and teach children about it.''
   He added, ``Austria sits there as if they never took part in it
(the Holocaust) at all. It talks about itself as the first victim.
That's all such nonsense and that has to be changed.''
   About 36,500 Jews still live in West Berlin and West Germany.

<HEAD>Guild Sues Producers for Allegedly Interfering with Independents</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The striking Writers Guild of
America sued over a dozen leading producers Tuesday, claiming they
are interfering illegally with guild efforts to sign contracts with
independent producers.
   The guild's antitrust lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court,
named 19 defendants, including the Alliance of Motion Picture and
Television Producers, the three television networks and several
Hollywood studios, including Disney, Universal and Colombia.
   Guild attorneys said the defendants had ``refused to deal'' with
some of the 151 independents that have signed interim contracts
with the WGA.
   The suit alleges that such conduct is anti-competitive. It seeks
a court declaration that the defendants violated federal antitrust
statutes and that they be ordered to halt such alleged activity.
   ``I think it is appropriate that we respond in this way,'' WGA
West Executive Director Brian Walton said at a news conference at
guild headquarters.
   Alliance spokesman Herb Steinberg said the allegations in the
suit ``have no merit.
   ``The action only diverts attention from the real issue, which
is resolving the strike,'' Steinberg said.
   Representatives of independent film companies have complained to
the guild of pressure to reject interim agreements, union officials
said.
   All three networks have vowed publicly to refuse programming
produced by the independents during the strike, now in its 19th
week. The strike already has forced the networks to delay the start
of their fall programming season.
   The producers' behavior ``is sad and lacks compassion,'' guild
president George Kirgo said.
   ``That the alliance continues to refuse to compromise wreaks
enough havoc. To conspire to prevent others from making a fair deal
which would employee men and women in this industry is
unconscionable.''
   The producers alliance has said that its last contract offer,
which the WGA rejected by a 3-1 margin on June 22, is final. The
two sides are divided over payments for reruns of one-hour shows
domestically and all programs overseas. The strike has resulted in
sweeping layoffs throughout the entertainment industry.
   A spokesman for a dissident group of scriptwriters called the
Writers Coalition reacted negatively to the lawsuit.
   ``We are tremendously distressed that (at this point) in the
strike, recourse is being left to the courts. It seems to indicate
a lack of urgency,'' he said.
   The coalition, which claims to include over 300 of the WGA's
9,000 members, believes talks between the union and the producers
are stalled and plans to meet Thursday night in Santa Monica to
discuss writers' ``options,'' the spokesman said. He declined to
say what those options might be.
   ``There comes a point in time where working members can no
longer take the losses,'' he said.

<HEAD>Mexico Approves First Extradition Since 1961</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Foreign Ministry announced Tuesday that
Mexico has approved a U.S.-requested extradition for a West German
woman wanted in connection with a major 1984 drug trafficking case.
   A U.S. Embassy official said it was the first time in 27 years
that Mexico has permitted such an extradition.
   The official, said speaking on condition of anonymity. said U.S.
marshals will arrive next week to escort Veronica Kiera-Wahl to
Atlanta, where the case is pending in federal court.
   The Foreign Ministry said the government's decision to grant the
request ``confirms its decision to cooperate in the sanctioning of
all types of crimes of (an) international (nature) and, in this
particular case, those that signify the fight against drug
trafficking.''
   U.S. Ambassador Charles J. Pilliod Jr. was recalled to
Washington for consultations last month after Mexico released
Puerto Rican separatist William Morales from jail and let him fly
to Cuba. The United States wants Morales as a terrorist bomber and
the State Department expressed ``outrage'' at his release.
   A ministry statement said Mexico approved the Kiera-Wahl
extradition on June 30. It said Ms. Kiera-Wahl, reportedly born in
Breslau, Germany, in 1942, took part in a shipment of approximately
13,000 pounds of cocaine from Colombia to the United States between
March and September 1982.
   The U.S. Embassy official said Ms. Kiera-Wahl is wanted in
connection with a 1984 Tampa, Fla., cocaine case involving Harold
Joseph Rosenthal.
   Rosenthal, a former Atlanta bail bondsman, was sentenced to life
in prison without parole and fined $425,000 after being convicted
in October 1984 on charges stemming from what prosecutors at the
time called the largest cocaine ring in the United States.
   Prosecutors said the ring imported $3.8 billion worth of cocaine
into the United States during a 14-month period ending in 1984,
using airplanes to fly in the drugs from South America and from the
Caribbean.
   Rosenthal said he was working for the CIA and ran the drug
operation as part of his duties.
   Also convicted were Robert Edward Dunleavy of Coral Springs,
Fla.; George Lombardi of Margate, Fla.; Garland Hubert Watson of
Rockwood, Tenn.; Larry Roger Stewart of Dalton, Ga.; and Rose Marie
Junker and Joseph Junker, both of Philadelphia.
   The Mexican statement said the United States asked for Ms.
Kiera-Wahl's extradition on Sept. 8, 1987.
   It said the first district federal judge in Yucatan state,
Francisco Javier Patino Perez, on May 20 ruled against a petition
by Ms. Kiera-Wahl that sought her exclusion from the provisions of
the extradition treaty. Ms. Kiera-Wahl did not appeal the decision,
the statement said.
   The embassy official said the Foreign Ministry advised that it
had no objection to the extradition request for Ms. Kiera-Wahl.
   Mexican authorities took her into custody on the Yucatan
peninsula at the West German government's request, the embassy
official said.
   About a dozen U.S. extradition cases are pending with the
Mexican government, the official said.
   In the Morales case, Morales, 37, got time off for good behavior
and was released after serving five years of an eight-year sentence
for his role in the murder of a Mexican policeman.
   The Foreign Ministry decided the case was not covered by the
U.S.-Mexican extradition treaty.

   Troops used tear gas and clubs
Tuesday to disperse peasants delivering food to striking electrical
workers.
   Marco Tulio Lima, president of the independent Confederation of
Cooperative Associations, told reporters two people were beaten by
soldiers and two were detained.
   The armed forces press office issued a statement saying the
electrical workers and peasants provoked a confrontation by
damaging vehicles and that air force troops were sent to the scene
``to insure order.''
   It said two troopers were struck by demonstrators and one union
member, identified as Fidel Angel Quintanilla, was arrested.
   Lima and witnesses said about 100 members of the agricultural
cooperatives went to a plant of the state-owned CEL electrical
utility in the San Salvador suburb of Soyapango and delivered sacks
of rice, beans and other foodstuffs to the electrical workers.
   They said a truck carrying about 30 soldiers arrived and the
troopers fired tear gas at the peasants and then attacked with
clubs.
   CEL repair workers have been reporting to work but refusing to
carry out their duties.
   About 3,500 CEL repair and maintenance workers went on strike
June 15 demanding salary increases and improved vacation and
life-insurance benefits.
   They are asking for pay boosts averaging $60 a month, $4 per day
for job-related travel expenses and $10,000 in personal life
insurance. They said mines planted near utility towers by leftist
guerrillas battling the U.S.-backed government make their jobs
hazardous.
   Rene Rodriguez, president of the CEL Employees' Association,
said on July 2 that five technicians have been killed and five
disabled by exploding mines.
   CEL officials have refused to negotiate with the strikers,
saying the association has no legal standing. The union was legally
dissolved after a strike in 1980 that the company said was
organized by leftists.
   Average salaries for the maintenance and repair workers range
from $140 to $200 per month.
   On July 3, strike leaders sent emergency crews to repair damage
from guerrilla sabotage that blacked out most of the country.

   President Reagan's decision to pay families of
the 290 people killed in the U.S. downing of an Iranian airliner is
meeting resistance on Capitol Hill, where some lawmakers say the
gesture is premature and politically touchy.
   Reagan's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, revealed the plans on
Monday, saying Reagan was motivated by humanitarian concerns and
was acting out of charity rather than obligation. He made it clear
that payments were to go to victims' families and not to the Tehran
government of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   But some members of Congress said that distinction may be
largely lost on the U.S. electorate, which harbors long-simmering
resentment of Iran stemming from the seizure of the U.S. embassy in
1979, from its sponsorship of international terrorism and from the
continued holding of Americans in Lebanon.

   So far this year, 30 bears have been spotted from Reno to Lake

   Production of corn and other key crops is
being cut severely by a nationwide drought that already ranks with
the terrible burnouts of the 1930s and 1950s.
   While the winter wheat crop planted last fall stayed barely
ahead of the drought, the later crops planted this spring have been
brutalized by heat and dryness.
   Because it was planted last fall, winter wheat is one of the few
crops for which specific per-acre production estimates are
available. About 75 percent of the winter wheat has already been
harvested, according to USDA, and the drought loss nationally
hasn't been severe.

   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the Texan chosen by
Michael Dukakis as his vice-presidential running mate, has left a
24-year record in Congress that is a portrait of balance. But it
also reveals differences with Dukakis on key issues.
   Bentsen, himself a millionaire businessman, has consistently
backed favorable tax treatment for business and a light government
regulatory touch on industry. He also has been a hawk on military
issues, favoring weapons systems such as the MX missile and the B-1
bomber.
   He has balanced those conservative stances with a strong civil
rights record _ which could help calm concerns of blacks over
Dukakis' failure to choose runner-up Jesse Jackson for the No. 2
spot _ and with positions in favor of pension reform, permitting
housewives to establish individual retirement accounts and
providing prenatal care for poor pregnant women.

   With that, the selection process that began June 8 ended.
Dukakis would ask the Democratic National Convention to nominate
Bentsen as his running mate in the effort to capture the White

After Bentsen's name was announced on Tuesday, Brountas described

   Iran is taking the U.S. downing of its
airliner onto the international stage in hopes of bringing
worldwide condemnation of America.
   But in going before the U.N. Security Council and the
International Civil Aviation Organization, Iran may give the United
States a chance to demand answers that only Tehran may be able to
supply.
   Despite all that has been learned, many troubling questions have
arisen from the larger issue gnawing at America's conscience: how
could the USS Vincennes mistake Iran Air's Flight 655 carrying 290
people for an F-14 fighter plane?
   Out in the Persian Gulf, Rear Adm. Wlliam Fogarty is heading an
investigation that has broken the larger question into many smaller
ones dealing with the radar and computers aboard the Vincennes, and
the knowledge on which its skipper, Capt. Will C. Rogers III, based
his decision to fire.

   Sixteen lawyers for people and companies in
the defense procurement probe are demanding that the Justice
Department launch an investigation into the sources of leaks to the
press.
   A department official said Tuesday it is ``too early'' to decide
whether to do so.
   ``We are writing to you to request that you commence an
investigation and take appropriate remedial action to deal with the
virtual flood of leaks by Department of Justice employees involved
in or privy to the details of the investigation,'' the attorneys
said in their unusual letter. One lawyer called the joint effort
``extraordinary.''
   Several of the defense counsels are former assistant U.S.
attorneys, obviously taking advantage of their knowledge of
internal Justice Department procedures to stop what they feel is a
case of government officials trying their case in the newspapers
and on television.

   Former Pennsylvania Gov. Richard L.
Thornburgh, picked by President Reagan to head the troubled Justice
Department, pledged Tuesday to ``follow the evidence wherever it
may lead'' in the matter of outgoing Attorney General Edwin Meese
III.
   Thornburgh declined to answer questions about Meese in any
detail, however, in an appearance in the White House briefing room
with Reagan, who announced the nomination and urged swift
confirmation by the Senate. The administration will be in office
for only six more months.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Thornburgh's
nomination will be sent to the Senate during the week of July 25,
when Congress will be back from a weeklong recess that begins
Friday so that members can attend the Democratic National

   The nation's drought-battered corn crop may
produce 5.2 billion bushels this year, 29 percent less than
expected a few months ago and 26 percent below last year's bumper
harvest, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   Sharp reductions also are expected in 1988 wheat and soybean
production, the department said.
   Until drought and extreme heat tightened their grip in May and
June, USDA had projected this year's corn harvest _ based on yield
trends and an assumption of normal weather _ at 7.3 billion
bushels, up from last year's output of 7.06 billion.
   Corn is the largest and most important U.S. grain crop. As a
livestock feed it is the major building block for beef, pork,
poultry and dairy products. Along with wheat, soybeans and other
commodities, corn also is vital as an export, desired by many
countries wanting to upgrade their livestock programs.
   The new figures were based on updated projections that take the
drought into account and reflect conditions as of Tuesday.

   The Maumee River is hardly flowing these
days in this town whose name conjures images of waterfalls and
flowing streams.
   ``It is amazing,'' said Walter Jones, 53, who has lived near
this village in northwest Ohio most of his life. ``I do not think I
have ever seen the river this dry. We have had some droughts, but
nothing like this.''
   The Maumee has been the lifeblood for many communities along its
banks. But this summer, levels in some stretches of the
drought-stricken river have dropped so low that communities have
implemented mandatory water use restrictions.
   Few villages have suffered as much as Waterville. The Ohio
Department of Natural Resources says the Maumee at Waterville is
flowing at 12 percent of its normal rate. Water use has been
restricted since Memorial Day.

   Monitoring contractions of the uterus in the
seventh month of pregnancy can identify 70 percent of women who
will give birth to premature infants, and drugs can be used to
prevent many of those premature births, a researcher reported
Tuesday.
   ``We can use this data to make prematurity a preventable
event,'' said the researcher, Dr. Michael Katz of the Children's
Hospital of San Francisco. ``Not always _ but most of it.''
   About 350,000 babies are born prematurely in the United States
each year, and intensive care for the sickest of them costs the
nation $2 billion annually, said Richard Leavitt, a spokesman for
the March of Dimes in White Plains, N.Y.
   Until now, doctors have had few ways to identify women likely to
give birth prematurely, Katz said in New York at a reporters'
seminar sponsored by the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital of
Memphis, Tenn.

   Legislators of a mountain enclave that has been
involved in an ethnic tug-of-war for months voted Tuesday to secede
from Azerbaijan and join Armenia _ a dramatic first in Soviet

   The legislature of Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly Armenian
enclave in Azerbaijan, was unanimous except for one abstention in
the decision to secede and rename the area the Artsakh Autonomous
Region of Armenia, radio reporters in the territory reported.
   About 160,000 people live in Nagorno-Karabakh and three-quarters
are ethnic Armenians.
   The decision defies central authorities all the way up to
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and tests Kremlin tolerance of assertions of

   Benjamin ``Benny'' Begin brings the looks and
mannerisms of his father, former Prime Minister Menachem Begin, to
his run for parliament and the nostalgia factor could be important
for both him and his party.
   Benny Begin, a 45-year-old government geologist, is the first
son of an Israeli prime minister to run for office. He was chosen
this month as a candidate of the Likud bloc, the right-wing
alliance his father founded, in the Nov. 1 elections.
   He is taller and leaner but the hand and facial gestures, some
of his rhetorical flourishes and even his tone of voice are almost
identical to his father's.
   Party officials believe the Begin name on Likud's list could
help it win what promises to be a close contest with the
center-left Labor Party of Foreign Minister Shimon Peres for
control of the Knesset, the 120-seat parliament.

   A group of local Christian leaders
appealed to Universal Studios Tuesday to destroy the film ``The
Last Temptation of Christ,'' saying it portrays Jesus as a
``mentally deranged and lust-driven man.''
   ``It is the most serious misuse of film craft in the history of
filmmaking,'' the Rev. Lloyd John Ogilvie, senior pastor of the
First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood, said at a news conference
attended by four other prominent area Christians.
   Members of the group acknowledged they have not seen the movie,
but said they believed the film contains a dream sequence in which
Christ comes off his cross and has sex with Mary Magdalene.
   Universal reaffirmed it would release the film this fall. It
said the Christians were advocating censorship and were criticizing
a film after declining an invitation to see it.

   With new players and an infusion of new
money, viewers of Spanish-language television are getting a wider
range of programming, much of it now labeled ``Made in the USA.''
   When Spanish-language stations began on UHF channels in the
early 1960s, nearly all the programming was imported.
   In 1986, Hallmark Cards Inc. and First Chicago Venture Capital
purchased the importer of most of the programming, the
Mexican-owned network SIN, and its 11 related stations, so far
paying $585 million. The network, now called Univision, reaches 83
percent of the nation's Hispanics through 450 stations and cable
channels.
   And since 1985, Reliance Capital's Telemundo network has spent
more than $300 million to build a network in 16 markets reaching
about 60 percent of the nation's 18 million-plus Hispanics.
   ``When you're David and the other guy is Goliath you try new
things,'' said Telemundo chief Henry Silverman.
   In early 1987 both networks beefed up U.S. news programs, but
continued to rely largely on Latin American-produced entertainment:
soap operas, variety shows and sports. Now they're looking at more
U.S. programs.
   Telemundo began co-producing its own news with Atlanta's Cable
News Network in May and plans to offer an MTV-produced Friday-night
music video show from New York this summer, plus two daily game
shows produced by Inter TelEspan in Los Angeles.
   Univision produces 14 percent of its shows in the United States,
a ratio it plans to keep, said program chief Rosita Peru.
Nevertheless, the network plans a women's magazine show from Miami
in September and a new music video show from Los Angeles this
summer and will continue its monthly documentaries on U.S.
Hispanics.
   ``Our No. 1 program is `Sabado Gigante,''' said Ms. Peru,
referring to a Miami-based Saturday night program mixing lively
audience participation with games, music and product promotions.
   Recognizing the viewing potential of Anglos and bilingual
Hispanics, both networks are experimenting with English. The film
``Camila,'' an Argentinian love story, airs with English subtitles
on Univision in August. Telemundo's rock show features videos and
interviews in both languages.
   Both networks and their stations plan heavy coverage of the
political conventions, featuring reports by network news staffs and
local reporters. Univision is airing pre-convention specials and
may broadcast up to 90 minutes of daily convention coverage,
doubling late night newscasts to one hour.
   Telemundo plans up to an hour of convention news, a half-hour
produced by its CNN-based network news staff and the rest produced
by local news staffs at the convention for their stations.
   Mexico's Televisa, whose principals sold Univision to Hallmark
earlier this year, are also taking a second look at U.S. Hispanics.
Some of Televisa's owners kept a stake in U.S. television by
continuing to operate Galavision, a Spanish-language cable service.
   This September Galavision switches from movies, soap opera and
variety specials to a 24-hour news format. Mexico City-based
newscasts will use some Mexican TV anchors and reporters, but will
target U.S. Hispanics and have reporters in seven cities north of
the border.
   ``Over the years the competitive nature of Spanish television
has changed dramatically. Now there's Univision and Telemundo,''
said Galavision's Starrett Berry. ``We wanted to come out with a
format that would be dramatically different and unique to cable.''
   The relatively low cost of producing in Latin America made
imported entertainment a staple of U.S. Spanish-language
television. The recent moves are putting more U.S. productions on
the air, but not without new costs.
   It's costing Telemundo $4 million to shoot 140 episodes of a new
soap opera in San Antonio, Los Angeles, New York, Miami and Puerto
Rico, said Silverman.
   ``The best Mexican novela (soap opera) would cost under $1
million. It's four times the cost,'' he said. The show will be
syndicated for airing in Latin America, but devaluation of the peso
hurts potential returns on the investment.
   Still, more U.S. producers are looking at the growing Hispanic
audience. Inter TelEspan chief Howard Mercer said, ``The time has
come for the United States Hispanic television audience to have the
opportunity to view shows and participate in shows that have a
particular relevancy to Hispanic Americans.''
   The growth also offers advertisers more choices in reaching
Hispanics. In 1987, marketers spent $490 million to reach U.S.
Hispanics, up 23 percent from 1986, Hispanic Business magazine
reports. About $220 million went into Spanish television, a 56
percent jump from 1986.

   TAPE THAT _ In homes with VCRs, youngsters under 18 spend twice
as much time watching taped programs as do adults, according to AGB
Television Research, which also found in a recent study that most
of the VCR watching is prerecorded tapes, not home-recorded ones.
But when shows are taped off the air, soap opera installments are
viewed within 24 hours of taping while it might be a week before
viewers get around to watching prime-time shows they have taped.
AGB says 54.5 percent of the homes in its audience sample have VCRs.

   Today is Friday, July 22, the 204th day of 1988. There are 162
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On July 22, 1934, bank robber John Dillinger was shot to death
by federal agents outside Chicago's Biograph Theater, where he had
just seen the Clark Gable movie ``Manhattan Melodrama.''
Dillinger's violent end capped a 14-month crime spree that earned
him celebrity as well as notoriety.
   On this date:
   In 1587, a second English colony _ also fated to vanish under
mysterious circumstances _ was established on Roanoke Island off
North Carolina.
   In 1796, Cleveland, Ohio, was founded by Gen. Moses Cleaveland.
   In 1812, English troops under the Duke of Wellington defeated
the French at the Battle of Salamanca in Spain.
   In 1844, Anglican clergyman William Archibald Spooner was born
in London. Spooner, who became warden of New College, Oxford,
gained a reputation for transposing words or parts of words while
speaking _ errors that came to be known as ``spoonerisms.''
   In 1916, a bomb went off during a Preparedness Day parade in San
Francisco, killing 10 people.
   In 1933, American aviator Wiley Post completed the first solo
flight around the world in seven days, 18} hours.
   In 1937, the Senate rejected President Franklin D. Roosevelt's
proposal to enlarge the Supreme Court.
   In 1942, gasoline rationing began in the United States during
World War II.
   In 1943, Allied forces captured Palermo, Sicily.
   In 1975, the House of Representatives joined the Senate in
voting to restore the American citizenship of Confederate Gen.
Robert E. Lee, more than a century after his death.
   In 1981, Turkish terrorist Mehmet Ali Agca was sentenced in a
Rome court to life in prison for shooting Pope John Paul II.
   In 1986, for the first time in half a century, the House of
Representatives impeached a federal official. Judge Harry E.
Claiborne was later convicted by the Senate of tax evasion and
bringing disrepute on the federal courts.
   Ten years ago: President Anwar Sadat of Egypt delivered a speech
in which he said the only obstacle to Middle East peace was what he
termed the ``expansionist ambitions'' of Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin.
   Five years ago: Clicking her heels like Dorothy in ``The Wizard

re-flagged Kuwaiti tankers up and down the Persian Gulf to protect
them from possible attack by Iran.

   Thought for today: ``There are as many nights as days, and the
one is just as long as the other in the year's course. Even a happy

1977.
   In 1982, actor Vic Morrow and two children were killed when a
helicopter crashed on top of them during filming for ``Twilight
Zone: The Movie.'' (Director John Landis and four associates were
later acquitted of manslaughter.)
   In 1984, Vanessa Williams resigned as Miss America because of
nude photographs of her that were being published in Penthouse
magazine.
   In 1986, Britain's Prince Andrew married Sarah Ferguson in a
glittering ceremony at Westminster Abbey in London.
   Ten years ago: The Israeli Cabinet rejected Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat's call for the return of two areas in the occupied
Sinai as a goodwill gesture, but Prime Minister Menachem Begin said
he expected peace talks to resume shortly.
   Five years ago: President Reagan appealed in his weekly radio

   Nearly a quarter-century after visitors to the
1964 New York World's Fair were introduced to the Picturephone, the
see-as-you talk concept is being offered again.
   The cost is lower, but so is the technology.
   Unlike the moving images of the Picturephone, which let
fair-goers see as well as hear the person on the other end of the
wire, the new devices produce only a freeze-frame shot.
   And industry analysts still question whether the home video
phone's time has come.
   ``The issue is behavior,'' said A. Michael Noll, a professor of
communications at the University of Southern California who worked
for American Telephone & Telegraph Co. in new product planning in
the mid-1970s.
   Using the telephone is akin to ``whispering in the ear. Seeing
somebody almost destroys the intimacy of the communication,'' he
said. ``When we ask an audience whether they want to see on the
phone, half or more say no.''
   Mitsubishi officials recognize the psychological barrier
Picturephone ran into, but the company believes its VisiTel visual
phone display unit, introduced in the United States last November,
will fare better.
   VisiTel, the only consumer product of its kind now on the U.S.
market, has a camera lens that projects the user's image onto a
black-and-white, 4.5-inch screen. The image can be transmitted to
another VisiTel user in about five seconds. Since the unit uses
ordinary phone lines, the same calling rates apply when the Visitel
is used as when an ordinary phone is used.
   ``This is a passive product,'' said Tim Beck, national sales
manager for the visual telecommunications division of Mitsubishi
Electric Sales of America. ``It's not like picking up the phone and
immediately your picture is there. It only transmits when you hit
the send key,'' he said.
   Beck said VisiTels, retailing for about $400 each, are selling
``very well.'' The company has orders for about 64,000 units and
has delivered about 36,000 of them, he said.
   Two other Japanese companies, Sony Corp. and Matsushita's
Panasonic division, are planning to put similar products on the
market by Christmas.
   A variety of companies, such as PictureTel Corp. of Peabody,
Mass., sell devices that transmit moving images, but those are more
expensive and require higher-grade phone lines. They are mostly for
businesses.
   AT&T's Picturephone initially was aimed at the residential
caller. AT&T set up phones at central locations in New York,
Chicago and Washington. People could place calls from a
Picturephone at one of these locations to a Picturephone at another
location, where family or friends would be awaiting their
pre-arranged call.
   AT&T said it would extend service to other parts of the country
if demand was large enough, and a June 1964 press release said,
``There is no telling when Picturephone sets in the home will be as
common as telephones are today.''
   ``The problem was the technology was just ahead of its time.
There wasn't the demand for it,'' said Gary Whaite, manager of
AT&T's corporate staff for teleconferencing application
development. ``People didn't want themselves seen in what you would
call the private home environment. It just wasn't appealing to the
public.''
   It was also expensive to install and to use. Rates ranged from
$16 to $27 for the first three minutes at one of the Picturephone
centers. Installing a Picturephone in someone's home would have
cost thousands of dollars for special wiring to connect the device
to the phone network.
   AT&T eventually turned its attention away from residential
prospects and focused on the business community. Businesses were
more receptive to two-way video, but the growth of what came to be
known as teleconferencing was also slow because of the high cost of
equipment and the special circuits required.
   Even by the late 1970s, it cost about half a million dollars to
equip a room with video monitors, cameras and special wiring,
Whaite said.
   Technological advances began bringing the cost down
significantly in the 1980s and by the mid-1980s teleconferencing
was becoming more attractive to companies trying to cut travel
costs and open more lines of communication.
   Now, an estimated 150 to 200 companies have their own
teleconferencing networks ranging in size from two to 45 sites,
said Elliot M. Gold, a teleconferencing consultant based in
Altadena, Calif.
   Technology has much further to go before moving pictures can be
transmitted over ordinary phone lines at reasonable costs to the
consumer, and estimates of when that will happen range from seven
to 10 years at the earliest.
   But even when the technology develops, many see acceptance in
the business community as the key to unlocking the residential
market for video phones.
   ``Business started with personal computers, and then they went
into the home. It followed the business application because lots of
people take their work home,'' Whaite said.
   Home video phones ``will follow the same pattern, but it will
probably be a slower evolution ... and it will never get to the
proportions it will in the business environment,'' he said.
   Noll is more skeptical.
   ``I don't think the problem is technology. I think it's
behavior,'' he said. ``There is something inherent in people and
the way they communicate that doesn't fit into this technology.
   ``We're 20 years into this idea (see-as-you-talk phones) and
everybody is predicting it's going to take off and it doesn't take
off. That should tell us something.''

<HEAD>The Typical Democratic Delegate: White, Middle-Aged, Well-Educated</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fewer than a dozen politicians are among the
delegates to the 1988 Democratic National Convention, the party's
biggest political event.
   At least that's how many own up to being politicians.
   An Associated Pess survey of more than 3,200 of the 4,161
delegates to the convention found that while nearly 1,000 of them
hold elected offices _ including hundreds of members of Congress
and dozens of governors and mayors _ only a handful list their
occupation as ``politician.''
   To be exact, there are nine of them.
   They join nearly 300 lawyers, 100 retired people, an actor, a
cook and a casket manufacturer this week as they cram into the
cramped auditorium of the Omni to nominate Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis for president.
   Of the delegates _ who hail from all 50 states, the District of
Columbia, and five U.S. territories _ the typical convention-goer
is white, middle-aged and college-educated. Almost two-thirds of
them have not been delegates before, the AP survey found.
   Their average age is 47, some 67 percent went to college and 69
percent are white. Twenty-one percent are black and almost 5
percent are Hispanic.
   Under Democratic Party rules, the delegate seats are divided
equally among men and women, and while there are no firm quotas,
state parties were encouraged to recruit enough minorities so the
racial mix of the delegation roughly parallels that of the state's
Democratic voters.
   Still, there was some irritation at the party's affirmative
action program.
   ``We went from unfair to more unfair,'' said Morton Povman, a
Dukakis delegate from New York. ``Under the rules, a person can get
the most votes and be elected by the people and yet not be selected
as a delegate, not because Dukakis doesn't want you, but because if
you're a white Catholic and they have enough white Catholics,
they'll pick a black whatever.''
   While no floor fights are expected over the presidential
nomination, credentials challenges or changes to the rules, the
delegates come to town with a lot weighing on their minds.
   A sampling of those surveyed by the AP found that about a third
of them are worried about the federal budget deficit, unemployment,
foreign trade or the economy in general. Next on the list is
combatting the flow of illegal drugs into the United States,
followed by education and the twin issues of world peace and
nuclear arms control.
   ``I have a son who would be of age to go into service,'' said
Hilda Bourg, a Dukakis delegate from Mississippi. ``I want to keep
the nation at peace.''
   Asked his opinion of the nation's No. 1 issue, Charles Logsdon,
a sheriff from Elizabethtown, Ky., replied: ``As someone in law
enforcement, drugs. I think we need to quit calling it a war and
make it one.''
   Even with few issues to be fought out and so few self-confessed
politicians in attendance, politics _ that nasty business _ found
its way into the process.
   Asked if she thought the Democrats had devised a fair way of
picking delegates, Cyrel Foote, a Jackson delegate from Kansas,
complained: ``No, there's a lot of politics involved.''

<HEAD>Ann Richards: Good Ol' Speaker for Democratic Convention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEN HERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Treasurer Ann Richards, the keynote
speaker for the Democratic National Convention, says she learned
how to act like a good ol' boy from the best ol' boy she knew _ her
father.
   As a child growing up in Waco, Texas, she would sometimes make
the drugstore rounds with her father Cecil Willis, a pharmaceutical
salesman who knew that small talk could lead to big sales.
   ``That's where I first learned how good ol' boys talk to each
other. There's a lot of laughing and a lot of hurrahing and a lot
of back-slapping and a lot of fish stories,'' Ms. Richards recalled.
   ``It's tremendously important because it is a bond. It's a link
that lays the predicate for whatever serious business you have to
do. It kept women out because we didn't know how to do it. And
we're still not very good at it,'' she said.
   But those who have watched Ms. Richards' career say she has
become a master at good 'ol boy talk, and it is a key to her
success. In 12 years she has gone from housewife to county
commissioner to state treasurer to likely candidate for governor in
1990.
   Texas Railroad Commissioner John Sharp, state chairman of
Michael Dukakis' presidential campaign and a friend of Ms.
Richards, remembers taking her to meet some oilmen friends in
Midland.
   ``I came back from the rest room and Richards and these oil guys
were sitting there on their hands and knees shooting dice up
against the wall. Had there been money passing hands, those guys
would still be paying debt. She had all the little scraps of paper
in front of her,'' Sharp said.
   ``That little story probably illustrates the secret of her
popularity. She has never met a stranger. She always fits in,'' he
said.
   Earlier in her life, Ms. Richards, now 54, fit into the
traditional female role of the day. Politics played little part in
it.
   ``I can remember a time in my life when I wouldn't give a recipe
to a friend because that was the only form of power I had,'' she
has told many audiences.
   She also remembers attending meetings of Girls State, which
includes a mock legislature run by and for girls. Politics remained
largely a spectator sport for females.
   ``It was fun to pretend,'' she said of the Girls State sessions,
``but you didn't really think you were going to ever go back and do
it yourself. I didn't think that until I was grown and had four
kids.''
   Her high school debate talents won her a scholarship to Baylor
University, where she met David Richards. They married while in
college. She became a teacher in Austin while he finished law
school and later practiced law.
   In 1976, some friends called the Richards' home and asked David
to run for county commissioner. He could not make the race. So they
turned to Ms. Richards, who had helped engineer victories for two
female legislative candidates, and she eventually said yes.
   She upset an incumbent and kept the job until 1982 when she ran
for state treasurer, trying to follow two unlikely-named treasurers
_ Jesse James, who held the job for almost 40 years, and Warren
Harding, who eventually was indicted for official misconduct.
   Ms. Richards took 47 percent of the vote and advanced to a
Democratic runoff against Harding. He withdrew and Ms. Richards
handily beat a GOP challenger.
   She was re-elected without opposition in 1986 and has been
credited with taking a quill-pen agency into the computer era.
   The political success came despite personal problems. In 1980,
at her family's urging, she sought treatment for alcoholism. She
says she has not had a drink since then.
   In 1984, David and Ann Richards were divorced. She said it was
as amicable a split as possible. David Richards was on hand to
congratulate his ex-wife on the day the Democrats picked her as
keynote speaker.
   In her dozen years as an elected official, Ms. Richards' has
become a favorite speaker on the political circuit. She uses her
wicked wit to make points, but not injure.
   ``Now are there any other white men who haven't spoken yet?''
she said when she recently followed several white men as speakers
at a Democratic fund-raiser. ``God knows we don't want to leave any
of you out.''

   The head of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the top federal prosecutor of insider trading have
endorsed legislation that would make brokerage firms liable when
employees violate securities laws.
   However, SEC Chairman David S. Ruder and U.S. Attorney Rudolph
W. Giuliani cautioned Monday that the law should exempt firms and
supervisors that make a good-faith effort to prevent their
employees from using non-public information to profit from trading
in securities.
   They said a draft bill offered by Rep. Edward J. Markey,
D-Mass., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce finance
subcommittee, should more carefully spell out when brokerage firms
would be subject to fines for the violations of their employees.

   An Omaha, Neb. business executive accused of
passing inside corporate information to a friend who later used it
to buy stock gas settled civil charges by agreeing to pay the
government more than $282,000.
   Donald L. Sturm, 56, signed a consent agreement without
admitting guilt Monday, settling a civil insider trading lawsuit
filed the same day by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   The SEC accused Sturm, a bank owner who also is vice chairman of
Omaha-based Peter Kiewit Sons Inc., a construction and
manufacturing company, of getting non-public information from a
relative about the corporate takeover of a North Carolina air cargo
service.
   Sturm allegedly passed the information to a friend who bought
30,000 shares of stock with money loaned by Sturm and made $128,412
in trading profits, the SEC contended.

   Revenue passenger miles _ the amount of miles flown by paying

1988 compared with the first half of 1987.
   An Eastern spokeswoman noted Monday that available seat miles in

   Kentucky's governor has criticized the federal government for
being too slow in dealing with the drought, and Iowa's governor
warns that farmers in his state still face potential disaster
despite up to five inches of rain over the weekend.
   Crews began installing pumps on barges Monday to haul fresh
water to southern Louisiana towns plagued by rising salt levels in
the lower Mississippi River.
   Meanwhile, House Speaker Jim Wright said in Washington he hopes
that a relief package with disaster payments of up to $100,000 for
drought-stricken farmers will win committee approval and be ready
for floor action in Congress this week.

   The drought may force the government to ease
crop acreage controls next year to help the United States rebuild
its grain inventories, says Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng.
   But the United States will continue to be a major player in
world agriculture and in 1989 should be able to bounce back from
this year's drought losses, he said Monday.
   A larger portion of the United States suffered from some degree
of drought stress in May and June than at any point since records
began in 1895, Lyng said.

   July soybeans fell 66 cents a bushel Monday to $8.58, the lowest

   Crude oil futures prices have hit their lowest
closing level since late 1986, hurt by a selloff that traders blame
on too much supply and renewed skepticism about OPEC's ability to
restrain production.
   Monday's decline erased gains made last week that had been based
on fears of supply disruptions caused by the oil platform explosion
in the North Sea.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, an important barometer of
price trends, the August-delivery price for West Texas Intermediate
crude settled at $14.78 per barrel, down from $15.46 late Friday.
It was the lowest closing price for the near-month crude contract
since a $14.71 close on Nov. 3, 1986.

<HEAD>Survey: Nine Biotech Drugs On Market, 81 On the Way</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nine drugs and vaccines created through
biotechnology have reached the U.S. market and 81 others are in the
final stages of development, according to an industry-sponsored
survey released today.
   ``Biotechnology, a relatively young technology, obviously has
matured,'' the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association said in
releasing what it called the most comprehensive survey on the
subject to date.
   A strong business commitment to biotechnology is benefiting the
public by creating products that can unclog heart vessels, ease
transplants and treat diseases such as diabetes, leukemia and
hemophilia, the Washington-based group stated in a news release.
   ``Biotechnology is changing the very nature of this industry and
will have a profound effect on medical treatment in the years
ahead,'' the group's president, Gerald J. Mossinghoff, said in a
prepared statement.
   But the heated competition between companies also is leading to
conflicts over property rights, because many companies are at work
on similar products, the industry organization said.
   ``Uncertainty over property rights and lack of information about
patents could lead to wasted resources, longer development times
and higher development costs,'' the group said.
   The survey also found:
   _Forty of the 81 drugs and vaccines in development are for
various types of cancers, making cancer the most frequently
targeted disease of biotechnology-based products.
   _Seven of the 81, none yet approved, are aimed at AIDS.
   _Americans won 80 percent of the 206 genetic engineering patents
issued by the U.S. Patent Office last year, while Japan was a
distant second with about 9 percent, the survey found.
   _U.S. corporations led the list of recipients of genetic
engineering patents last year, with 45 percent.
   Sloan-Kettering Institute, the New York research institution,
was the top receipient of genetic engineering patents last year,
with 13.
   But the rest of the top four were all private companies: Cetus
Corp., with 11; Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., with nine; and
Genentech and Eli Lilly, each with eight.
   Of the products already on the market, the best-known are
Genentech Inc.'s heart attack drug, Activase, which dissolves blood
clots; Merck & Co. Inc.'s hepatitis B vaccine; and Eli Lilly and
Co.'s genetically-engineered human insulin for diabetics.
   The 81 products in development include 67 that are being tested
on people in clinical trials and 14 that have completed trials and
are awaiting approval by the Food and Drug Administration.
   Patent protection for biotechnology advances is critical because
companies want to make sure that they will be able to earn a fair
return on their heavy investments.
   The Office of Patents and Trademarks has cut down the backlog of
biotechnology patent applications, to 6,500 from 7,800 a year ago,
but it still takes an average of more than four years to process
applications, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association said.
   To deal with the backlog, the patent office is reorganizing and
assigning a larger portion of new examiners at higher pay to
biotech patents. The goal is to cut the processing time to 18
months by 1993 or 1994, the association said.

   The dollar eased in moderate European trading
early today amid signs of renewed intervention by central banks to
prevent its advance. Gold prices fell.
   Dealers in Rome said the West German and Belgian central banks
were rumored to have sold dollars on the open market, but they said
other central banks had not been sighted in early trading.
   Some dealers said they expected the dollar to settle within a
narrow range before Friday's release of U.S. merchandise trade
figures for May.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.63 Japanese yen to a closing 132.70 yen.
Later, in London, it edged back to 132.90 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Monday's
quotes, included: 1.8392 West German marks, down from 1.8460;
1.5273 Swiss francs, down from 1.5350; 6.1937 French francs, down
from 6.2080; 2.0737 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0750; 1,363.50

   The dollar retreated against the Japanese yen today
in Tokyo, while share prices topped the 28,000-point barrier in
active trading on the stock exchange.
   The dollar started trading at 132.90 yen before peaking at
133.08 yen, its high for the day, during the morning session. It
fell steadily in afternoon dealings before closing trading at
132.70 yen, down 0.63 yen from Monday's 133.33 yen. It reached a
low of 132.60 yen at one point.
   ``The dollar is being thrown around by comments from various
people in the financial circle,'' said a dealer at a major
securities firm, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said the currency reacted today to a statement by a
high-ranking Federal Reserve Board official that the United States
is ready to tolerate a higher dollar.
   ``The dollar is going to be sensitive until the release of U.S.
trade figures'' scheduled for Friday, said the dealer. He added
that the currency is likely to move between a range of 131-133 yen
prior to the announcement.
   The dollar has been forced lower in the past by U.S. trade
reports showing a growing imbalance of imports over exports. But
recent reports have shown improvements in the trade gap and the
U.S. currency has stabilized.
   However, the dealer said sentiment in the market seemed to show
that traders do not expect an improvement in the May figures. ``The
last two months were good so this time it may be bad,'' he said.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues built on its 68.91-point gain registered Monday and
added a further 113.85 points, or 0.40 percent, for a 28,099.84
total by the end of trading.
   The index last closed on the 28,000-point level on June 20 when
it finished trading at 28,139.03.
   ``The gain was better than expected,'' said the securities
dealer. ``Summer is usually a slow season for stock trading.''
   Traders attributed the Nikkei gain to activity centered on
large-capital issues, including steel and heavy industrials.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 1.9 billion shares,
up from 1.1 billion shares Monday.
   ``Prices will fluctuate,'' said the dealer. ``But the market is
basically strong.''

<HEAD>Japan's Trade Surplus Continues to Decline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's trade surplus shrank 16 percent during the
first half of 1988 as booming imports outstripped a moderate
increase in exports, the Finance Ministry reported Tuesday.
   Analysts said the United States was a major beneficiary of the
increased imports.
   The ministry said in its preliminary report Japan's trade
surplus during the first six months of the year was $33.7 billion,
or $6.4 billion less than in the first half of 1987.
   In June, the country had a surplus of $5.92 billion, down $668.3
million from the same month last year.
   Japan's surplus with the United States dipped 14.9 percent, from
$24.6 billion to $20.9 billion for the first half of this year
compared with the same period in 1987.
   The ministry attributed the rapid decline in Japan's trade
surplus to the steep increase in imports, fueled by the nearly 100
percent rise in the value of the Japanese yen against the U.S.
dollar in the last three years.
   The stronger yen made foreign products cheaper in Japan and
Japanese products more expensive abroad.
   The rising yen boosted the country's imports by 34.3 percent to
$91.8 billion for the first six months of 1988 on a custom-cleared
basis, while exports rose 15.7 percent to $125.4 billion.
   The statistics showed American exporters, bolstered by the weak
dollar, are increasing their sales in Japan faster than European
and Asian exporters. The United States is Japan's largest trading
partner.
   Sumio Hoga, director of the ministry's export department, said
Americans sold more office equipment, aircraft and capital goods to
Japanese while Japanese automobile exports to the United States
continued its downward trend.
   ``The United States is clearly a beneficiary of the yen
appreciation,'' said David Gerstenhaber, a senior economist with
Morgan Stanley International in Tokyo. ``American exports to Japan
is clearly outstripping its imports from Japan ... and the trend is
very unlikely to change.''
   Analysts see the decline in Japan's surplus and its increase in
imports as the beginning of a long trend.
   ``The figures for the first six months confirmed that Japan is
streadily heading the way to becoming an importing country,'' said
Josen Takahashi, a chief analyst at Mitsubishi Research Institute,
a Tokyo think tank.
   ``Imports are growing at much faster pace than we expected. It
seems like a matter of time until Japan's account marks a
deficit,'' he said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Tuesday gave its approval to
News Corp. Ltd.'s purchase of a 20.4 percent stake in Pearson PLC,
publisher of the Financial Times.
   The clearance came as Lord Young, the government's trade
secretary, decided not to refer the shareholding to the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission. The commission has the power to investigate
planned takeovers for possible adverse impact on competition or on
the public interest.
   News Corp., which owns several London newspapers including the
Times of London, began acquiring Pearson shares last September,
when it launched a ``dawn raid'' _ the surprise purchase of a large
number of shares in the open market _ that took its holding to just
under 15 percent of Pearson's shares.
   Subsequent purchases, including a 4.9 percent stake bought from
Cerus BV, controlled by Italian financier Carlo de Benedetti, took
News Corp.'s holding to 20.4 percent.
   News Corp., which is controlled by publisher Rupert Murdoch, has
said it doesn't intend to bid for the remainder of Pearson in the
absence of a material change in the circumstances of the company.
   Lord Young said late last year any takeover bid for the
Financial Times would be referred to the commission.

<HEAD>Toymaker Files for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Coleco Industries Inc., which soared
to the top of the toy industry in the mid-1980s with its Cabbage
Patch Kids and then skidded into debt as the dolls' popularity
waned, announced today it filed for protection from its creditors
under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law.
   Coleco said the filing, which did not include its Canadian and
other foreign subsidiaries, was made Monday evening in the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.
   The toymaker said the filing followed the refusal of its
short-term bank lenders to agree to provide the company with an
adequate working capital credit line.
   Coleco also announced that Morton E. Handel, who is recovering
from recent open-heart surgery, has submitted his resignation as
chief executive officer, citing the company's need for a full-time
CEO during this period. He will continue as chairman of the company.
   The board of directors appointed J. Brian Clarke, currently
president and chief operating officer, as president and chief
executive officer.
   The bankruptcy filing had been expected after Coleco was unable
to persuade its bondholders to agree to a $335 million debt
restructuring. The company lost $47.4 million in the quarter that
ended April 2 and has suffered losses in four of the past five
years, including $215 over the last two years.
   Coleco owes more than $100 million to a group of foreign and
domestic lenders.
   In recent weeks, the company has tried to raise cash by selling
off some of its product lines. On Monday, Hasbro Inc., the nation's
largest toymaker, said it had agreed to purchase some of Coleco's
assets and lines for $21 million, including the plastic wading and
splashing pools and children's outdoor furniture lines.
   Those lines, which helped launched Coleco in the toy business in
1956, had sales last year of $77 million.
   Coleco also has slashed its work force in an effort to cut
costs. It currently has fewer than 600 employees in the United
States, down from an average of 2,500 last year.
   Besides Cabbage Patch Kids, Coleco manufactures Alf dolls, Big
Wheels plastic tricycles and board games, such as Scrabble.
Industry sources say the company holds about 5 percent of the
nation's toy market.
   Analysts said the same aggressive management style that helped
Coleco hit the jackpot with the gamble on Cabbage Patch Kids in
1983 helped bring on its troubles.
   The dolls, introduced in 1983 after a number of other toy
companies rejected the product, helped Coleco end 1985 in its
strongest financial condition ever, with sales of $776 million and
record earnings of $64 million.
   But the Cabbage Patch fad abated and analysts said the company
did not pare its costs soon enough. When the toy industry suffered
a slump in 1987, the company was hit particularly hard.
   Coleco has faced tough times before. It entered the snowmobile
business in 1972, but snowfalls were light for the next three
years, the economy was depressed and losses were heavy.
   The company posted a $22 million loss in 1978, threatening its
survival. In 1980 the Securities and Exchange Commission charged
Coleco with misstating its financial results to mask troubles.
   In 1982 the company began a move toward prosperity with the
introduction of its ColecoVision home video game system. The
company saw its future in electronics, and in 1983 unveiled its
$600 Adam home computer.
   Adam was a monumental flop, while sales of ColecoVision cooled.
The company lost $79.8 million in 1984 despite $540 million in
sales of Cabbage Patch Kids.

   Donald L. Sturm, a top executive of Peter Kiewit

   Sturm, 56, vice chairman of the Omaha, Neb.-based construction

   Under the agreement, which doesn't include an admission of

   The London firm Ward White Group PLC has
said it is not interested in pursuing the acquisition of Payless
Cashways Inc. after reviewing information about the building
materials firm.
   ``Any interest we had is withdrawn,'' David Bick, a spokesman
for Ward White, said Monday.
   Molson Cos. Ltd., a diversified Canadian company, also said
Monday that it did not have any interest in acquiring Payless after
examining public information about the company. Sanjib Choudhuri,
senior vice president of corporate development and planning,
declined to say why his company lost interest.
   Senior management of Payless has offered $27 a share to take the
company private. The offer was made to thwart an unfriendly
takeover attempt by New York investor Asher Edelman and Sutherland
Lumber-Southwest Inc., a competitor of Payless.
   The offer by Payless management is worth $909 million.
   Bick said Ward White was approached by an investment banking
firm two or three weeks ago about Payless. He said Ward White
agreed to request information about Payless because a takeover
seemed worth considering, but Ward White's interest was never great.
   ``We no longer need nor want the information,'' Bick said.
   Ward White owns the third-largest building materials retailing
chain in the United Kingdom.
   The Edelman-Sutherland group is Payless' largest shareholder
with 8.1 percent of the stock. It had said for weeks that it is
interested in acquiring Payless, but has not made a formal offer.
   The offer from Payless management requires the approval of
two-thirds of the shareholders, who have until 3 to respond.
   Payless has 200 stores in 26 states.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened mixed to higher
today on the Chicago Board of Trade, recovering slightly from
Monday's steep losses in cautious trading ahead of an eagerly
awaited crop report.
   The Agriculture Department report, due out after the close, was
to include revised production estimates for wheat, corn and
soybeans.
   The USDA normally does not revise its springtime production
estimates until August. But government experts decided to revise
the figures in today's report to reflect the effects of the drought.
   Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research Department Inc. in
Chicago, predicted the USDA would be conservative in estimating
drought damage.
   ``This report will be based on computer models,'' he said.
``Once you get into the August report, you have extension agents
going out in the fields and doing some sample surveys.''
   Prices for grain and soybean futures fell sharply Monday in
reaction to weekend rains in the Corn Belt and forecasts for more
showers this week.
   In early trading, wheat was 3} cents to 5\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.72 a bushel; corn was 1} cents
lower to 7} cents higher with July at $2.96 a bushel; oats were 5{
cents lower to 11 cents higher with July at $2.77 a bushel;
soybeans were 5 cents lower to 14 cents higher with July at $8.72 a
bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly lower while pork futures were mostly
higher in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle settled .37 cent lower to .25 cent higher with
August at 66.15 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .17 cent to .55
cent lower with August at 75.70 cents a pound; hogs were .02 cent
lower to .57 cent higher with July at 45.50 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .08 cent to .55 cent higher with July at 33.10

   Intel Corp.'s profit nearly tripled

   The number of Americans changing residences
dipped after the 1984-85 burst of home sales triggered by falling
interest rates, the Census Bureau says.
   Some 3 million fewer Americans moved between 1985-86 than in the
previous year, with virtually all of the drop occuring in the
category of moves within the same county, according to the
geographical mobility report released Tuesday by the bureau.
   Lower interest rates unleashed a pent-up demand for new homes in
the 1984-85 year, spurring the mobility rate to 20.2 percent,
highest in this decade, said Kristin A. Hansen, an analyst in the
bureau's Population Division.
   But in 1985-86 the rate of movement slipped back to 18.6
percent, a decline, but still the second highest rate in the 1980s,
she said.
   The figures are the most recent detailed statistics on mobility
available. However, data collected by the departments of Commerce
and Housing and Urban Development indicate that continued low
interest rates helped spur strong sales of both new and existing
homes last year.
   Mobility rates fell to all-time lows early in this decade, Ms.
Hansen said, as people postponed their quests for better homes
because of high interest rates.
   The mobility low of 16.6 percent of Americans age 1 and over was
achieved in 1982-83, Census figures show. The level was about 20
percent throughout the 1950s and 1960s.
   Mobility statistics were first recorded in 1948, when it was
found that 19.9 percent of Americans had moved in the previous year.
   In the 1970s, Ms. Hansen explained, rates of moving declined
because of the decline in the size of families. People no longer
needed to seek larger homes to accommodate more people, she
commented.
   Also, there was a slight increase in homeownership in that
period, and owners are less likely to relocate than renters.
   In the 1985-86 year the main change was in the number of
residents who oved within the same county, 13.1 percent compared to
11.3 percent a year earlier.
   ``Local reasons for moving are usually housing-related or
changes in life cycles'' she said, such as children moving to their
own homes, getting married and so forth.
   Regionally, the Northeast continued to lose people to other
regions, with a net loss of 250,000 movers, while the West
continued to gain, receiving about 200,000.
   The Midwest reversed its recent pattern of loss, however,
gaining about 15,000 interstate movers in the year, while the
influx to the South was down to only 35,000 new residents.
   Ms. Hansen speculated that this is a result of the recent
problems in the energy industry in such southern states as Texas
and Louisiana, which are no longer attracting workers from the
Midwest. Indeed, many who moved there to work in oil fields may be
heading back home, she said.
   By age, the rate of movement is highest among young adults and
declines with age, Ms. Hansen observed. And by race, blacks tend to
move more than whites.
   While many factors are at work, mobility generally declines as
income increases. Those with less money are more likely to be
renters, while higher income people tend to own homes and may be
tied to an area by business and professional relationships.
   Here is a rundown of the overall share of Americans aged 1 and
over who moved over one-year periods.

   A year ago, the British mass-market jeweler
Ratners Group PLC spent about $200 million to acquire an Ohio-based
jewelry company.
   The experience was so positive, the transaction so simple, and
the rewards potentially so great, that Ratners since has snapped up
two more U.S. companies.
   Ratners embodies a veritable 10-year tradition among the
British, who are the most prolific acquirers of U.S. businesses,
followed by the Canadians, West Germans, French and Japanese.
   Those expecting to see a slowdown tied to the dollar's recent
resurgence in foreign-exchange trading may be disappointed. Like a
tycoon buying a fine diamond for his mistress, corporate suitors
from abroad still act as if money is no object, at least not now.
   Last year, foreigners spent $40.4 billion on U.S. acquisitions;
in the first six months of this year, the tally registered $21
billion by some estimates.
   Those involved in the deals _ from investment bankers to the
purchasers themselves _ say the status of the U.S. currency is of
little consequence as long as it doesn't really skyrocket.
   ``It's a commercial strategy, not the exchange rate that's going
to influence us,'' said Andrew Coppel, Ratners' group finance
director, from his London office.
   Since its long decline bottomed out recently, the dollar's value
has risen as much as 10 percent against some major currencies. Most
foreign companies with U.S. operations are active participants in
the currency markets, buying and selling dollars as a hedge against
swings in the exchange rate.
   W.T. Grimm & Co., a Chicago-based firm that tracks mergers and
acquisitions, noted that foreigners often end up paying even more
for U.S. companies than American acquirers.
   While Grimm attributed that to their ``aggressive entry into the
U.S. market,'' investment bankers look to more practical
considerations. For one thing, ``You've got a lengthier process of
negotiating a contract simply because you must bring all your
troops from your home country, and they're not familiar with the
process,'' said Les Fabuss, a senior vice president at Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc.
   In addition, foreigners often do not initiate their own,
exclusive transactions.
   ``It's hard for them to say, `I want company X' and go out and
try to get it. They tend to appear in auction situations where the
highest price wins, and currency allows them to pay slightly
more,'' he added.
   Last year, foreign buyers announced 220 takeover deals,
accounting for 11 percent of all the mergers and acquisitions in
the United States, Grimm reported.
   Nearly half of those deals carried price tags of $100 million or
more, with the average price of a U.S. company totaling a record
$315.4 million.Most of the takeovers occurred in the retail,
chemicals and industrial equipment and machinery categories.
   Among the billion-dollar deals so far this year are the British
construction company Beazer PLC's purchase of Koppers Inc. and
Canadian investor Robert Campeau's acquisition of Federated
Department Stores Inc.
   Currently under way is the sale of at least a dozen units of the
Singer Co. to help finance Florida investor Paul Bilzerian's
purchase of the machinery and defense company. A number of
foreigners are bidding on those operations.
   Despite their willingness to pay top dollar for U.S. properties,
foreigners are still finding some relative bargains here. The Labor
Department said American factories outperformed their rivals
overseas last year in reducing labor costs and making their goods
more competitive on world markets.
   Measured in devalued American dollars, labor costs in the United
States declined 1.5 percent in 1987, compared with increases of 7.5
percent in South Korea, 7.7 percent in Canada, 13.5 p\_Z]ss, an economist
with Data Resources Inc. of
Lexington, Mass.
   Finding an American mate takes some looking. Coppel said Ratners
began assessing the U.S. market in September 1986 and quickly
realized the ``enormous potential of the $20 billion-a-year
(jewelry) market.''
   With the help of PaineWebber Inc., Ratners zeroed in on Sterling
Inc., headquartered in Akron, Ohio. The deal closed less than a
year later.
   Of particular interest to Ratners was Sterling's diamond
expertise. Savvy in buying raw gemstones in Tel Aviv, Bombay and
the Netherlands, Sterling has shown Ratners how to cut costs so
much that Coppel predicted the company's diamond business would
jump from 12 percent to 20 percent of total sales.
   ``Since then we've been able to acquire two other companies at a
much more favorable (exchange) rate,'' Coppel said, referring to
the privately held jewelers Osterman Inc. of Toledo and Westhall
Inc. in Akron.
   George C. Lodge, a professor at Harvard University's business
school, said that the type of company helps determine the price
foreigners are willing to pay.
   ``If you're coming here to acquire the latest American
technology in gene-splitting, the dollar rate is not as important''
because intellectual assets are harder to value, he said. ``On the
other hand, if you are coming here to set up an auto factory, then
the exchange rate becomes more important.''
   Political pressure has kept the technologically aggressive
Japanese from bidding on American high-tech companies, but politics
may also be contributing to the foreign merger wave.
   ``As the politics of trade become more intense, Japanese and
European companies regard a holding in the U.S. as a protector of
their access to our marketplace,'' Lodge said.
   As the flow of business across the oceans increases, investment
banking companies have responded by paying more attention to
courting overseas clients. Over the past year, Shearson has opened
full-service offices in West Germany and France, rather than
relying on small branches.
   Merrill Lynch & Co. is looking east for growth. Employment in
the company's Tokyo office has jumped to 400 from 290 less than two
years ago. In addition, the company has established a ``Japan
group'' in New York to facilitate transactions between U.S. and
Japanese businesses, a spokesman said.
   At Chase Manhattan Bank, a new unit was established in April
specifically to work on foreign direct investment in the United
States. The operation's 20-member staff currently has ``several
major deals in the works,'' said bank spokesman Ken Mills.
   While foreigners are reveling in all the dollars their
currencies can buy, some of the Americans doing business with them
aren't so happy. One investment banker on a recent business trip in
Paris complained that his $435-a-night room at the elegant hotel Le
Crillon was a mere ``broom closet.''
   Lamenting how few francs his dollar buys, he said, ``Why is it
California chardonnays now make sense?''

   The next administration should push for new
gains in energy efficiency, and without sacrifice for conscientious
consumers, an advocacy group said Tuesday.
   Such a goal should incorporate an auto fuel-economy requirement
of 45 miles per gallon, a 50-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax increase
and a high ``gas-guzzler'' tax to be rebated to buyers of fuel
efficient cars, said the American Council for an Energy-Efficient
Economy.
   The report, produced by a panel of environmentalists, academics
and business executives, argued that abundant opportunities for
efficiency gains are the best way to counter several threats at
once _ acid rain, excessive dependence on imported oil,
international competition and the ``greenhouse'' warming of the
earth by man-made gases, notably the carbon dioxide produced by
burning fossil fuels.
   Also Tuesday, a related report was issued by the Safe Energy
Communications Council, an advocacy group supported by several
environmental organizations and others, arguing that nuclear power
has had virtually no effect in holding down oil use ``and cannot
have any substantial impact in the foreseeable future.''
   The communications council also argued for a 45 mpg fuel-economy
standard, to be raised to 60 mpg in the year 2008.
   Unlike many reports advocating the pursuit of efficiency, the
study by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy
explicitly argued that efficiency should be pursued only as long as
it's cost-effective _ with environmental and balance-of-trade costs
taken into account.
   Some of the authors told a news conference that point is a long
way away.
   ``The opportunities are proliferating ... the marketing folks
haven't been able to keep up with the engineers,'' said Howard
Geller, associate director of the council.
   Asked which party was more likely to be receptive to the
recommendations, Geller said, ``We would hope any administration
would accept this agenda and push it forward.''
   ``It's been a great disaster that conservation has been
associated with sitting in the dark,'' said another author, Robert
Socolow, director of the Center for Energy and Environmental
Studies at Princeton University.
   The report listed 10 improvements it considered still possible,
the largest being transmissions with continuously variable gear
ratios, estimated to improve efficiency by 12 percent. The second
best improvement, at 8 percent, would be engines with four valves
per cylinder. That design already has been incorporated in several
models in the past two or three years.
   Cars currently must get 26 mpg, and buyers will not demand
mileage above about 30 mpg because annual savings are small, the
authors said. The higher standards could mean cars would cost $200
to $800 more initially, but this would be recovered over the
lifetime of the car in reductions in operating costs, they said.
   A 50-cent tax would make sure ``consumers are given a price
signal that better reflects the real cost of the resource and
encourages conservation,'' and some of the $40 billion to $60
billion raised each year could be returned to the poor through
income tax provisions.
   The tax should be imposed in increments of 10 cents per year for
five years, the report said. If oil prices double, the tax should
be held to 30 cents. If fuel efficiency gains are disappointing,
the tax could climb higher.
   The gas-guzzler tax, which currently can exceed $2,000 for
certain luxury cars, should be broadened to raise funds for
rebates, perhaps $1,000, on fuel-efficent cars, the report said.
   The rebates could apply to models 50 percent better than today's
best, the report said. This would imply payments for cars getting
about 75 mpg.

   Stock prices fell today as investors showed
concern over interest rates and the trade deficit.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was off 19.74 points to
2,091.57 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers nearly 3 to 1 in the overall tally of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 364 up, 1,063 down and
466 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board, swelled by dividend-related trading,
came to 121.54 million shares as of 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Stock market investors have dwelled lately on the possibility
that the Federal Reserve will push up interest rates as a way to
cool the economy and stave off inflation.
   Concerns about rising interest rates have dampened the stock
market because more attractive yields on bonds could siphon money
away from stocks. Also, high rates could hurt stock prices by
slowing economic growth.
   ``This is a market that's back-pedaling,'' said Alan Ackerman,
an investment strategist for Gruntal & Co. ``Anxiety over higher
interest rates is keeping players on the sidelines as well as
stalling some of the summer sizzle that appears to lie ahead.''
   Traders also appeared cautious in advance of Friday's release of
figures on the May merchandise trade deficit.
   The heaviest trading was related to dividend-capture strategies.
Centerior Energy had more than 9 million shares change hands in
early trading. Puget Sound Power & Light and New York State
Electric & Gas each had more than 4 million shares traded.
   Coleco Industries was unchanged at 1~. The company announced it
had sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Code.
   Xidex rose 1\ to 8~ in over-the-counter trading. The maker of
computer disk drives said it agreed to be acquired by Anacomp for
$10 a share in cash. Anacomp was off 1 to 10 on the NYSE.

   Share prices fell Tuesday on the London Stock
Exchange in a spiritless session without market-moving news before
the release of U.S. and British economic data later in the week.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished 18.3
points, or 0.1 percent, lower at 1,858.5.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 12.80
points at 2,098.51 as London trading drew to a close, after opening
about 4 points higher. London traders said Wall Street's wobbly
performance punctuated an already declining British stock market.
   Dealers said the London market lacked a sense of direction and
there was a lack of news to spur share prices.
   ``There's really so little going on,'' said Roger Charlesworth,
senior dealer at Chase Manhattan Securities in London, adding: ``a
lethargy is beginning to creep into this market.''
   Economic data due for release later in the week kept players
cautious and sidelined. Of particular concern was Thursday's spate
of British corporate earnings reports and figures on British
unemployment, average earnings and industrial output, as well as
Friday's release of U.S. trade data for May and the British retail
price index for June.
   Lower crude oil prices weighed down oil company shares, as
takeover hopes within the sector were dashed, analysts said. Weak
oil prices were beginning to ``take the steam out'' of the rampant
takeover talk that has permeated the sector over recent weeks, said
Chris Chaitow, a technical stock analyst with Morgan Grenfell
Securities in London.

<HEAD>Survey Says American Attitudes Growing More Negative Toward Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans' attitudes toward illegal drug use
have grown more antagonistic over the past year, according to a
study released Tuesday by a volunteer group that has been trying to
de-glamorize drug abuse with a public service advertising campaign.
   The group, which calls itself the Media-Advertising Partnership
for a Drug-Free America, says the nation's media outlets donated
more than $150 million in free space and time for the barrage of
ads it made available in the first year of the anti-drug campaign.
The campaign was launched in March 1987.
   The amount of donated space fell short of the $500 million that
the group had set as its target for each year of the three-year
campaign. But campaign organizers said they were pleased with the
results nonetheless and hope media outlets will find significantly
more space and time for the ads this year.
   The television ads broke into the top 10 with consumers surveyed
by the independent Video Storyboard Tests Inc. last year, the first
time a public service campaign appeared in that list in the 10
years it has been compiled.
   One of the more popular ads that the Media-Advertising
Partnership created is a television commercial that shows a man
breaking an egg, scrambling it and frying it, saying that is what
happens to your brain when you take drugs.
   In addition to making 32 television ads, 25 radio commercials
and 80 print ads, the group had a benchmark survey of attitudes
toward illegal drug use done in February-March 1987 and followed
that up in the same period this year to see if those attitudes had
changed.
   The research firm Gordon S. Black Corp. of Rochester, N.Y., said
more than 4,650 people across the country completed questionnaires
for each survey.
   The latest study said the change in attitude was most pronounced
among college students, which had been among the first groups in
the 1960s to increase consumption of illegal drugs but is now
showing a greater fear of the consequences of drug abuse.
   ``Even more impressive is the first evidence of a decline in
occasional cocaine use,'' the study said.
   Occasional cocaine use among college students has dropped to 6
percent from 11 percent a year earlier, it said, while occasional
usage by friends had dropped to 31 percent from 36 percent.
   The survey said teenagers displayed the fewest changes in
attitude, although they generally took a dimmer view of drug use
and the drug user than they had a year earlier.
   The changes among children aged 9-12 and adults over age 18
showed improvement but fell in between those for college students
and teens, it said.
   On a more disconcerting note, the study said it found 18 percent
of the children surveyed said they had been approached to buy or
use drugs, up from 16 percent a year earlier.
   It also said parents appear to have become more unrealistic
about their own children's behavior.
   Forty-one percent of parents surveyed said it was either
certainly or probably untrue that ``my children are likely to try
drugs sometime,'' up from 36 percent a year earlier.
   But that result appeared to be at odds, the study said, with
other findings that includes 76 percent of the 16- and 17-year-olds
surveyed saying they had friends who use marijuana occasionally.
   The survey said there was evidence that the group's advertising
``played a major role'' in changing attitudes.
   Black said it identified 10 markets that used the most anti-drug
advertising, and said people living in those areas ``show a far
larger shift in their attitudes toward drugs than in the balance of
the United States.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures closed moderately
higher Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade in cautious trading
ahead of an eagerly awaited crop report.
   ``Overall, by recent standards, it was a fairly dull session,''
said Walter Spilka, a grain analyst in New York with Smith Barney,
Harris Upham & Co.
   The rally was basically a technical rebound after three days of
sharply lower prices, Spilka said.
   He said gains probably were limited by edginess over the
Agriculture Department crop report, which was released after the
close.
   News that the report's revised production estimates for corn,
soybeans and spring wheat would be based on conditions as of
Tuesday instead of July 1 prompted a buying flurry early in the
session, Spilka said.
   In the report, the agency estimated 1988 soybean production at
1.65 billion bushels, compared with a June estimate of 1.88 billion
and 1987 production of 1.9 billion bushels.
   This year's corn harvest was estimated at 5.2 billion bushels,
compared with the June estimate of 7.3 billion and year-ago
production of 7.1 billion.
   Production of all U.S. wheat this year was estimated at 1.84
billion bushels, compared with the June estimate of 2.12 billion
and 1987 production of 2.1 billion.

<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Venezuela has unilaterally postponed
payments on as much as $850 million in Republic of Venezuela bonds
scheduled to mature this year, the Finance Ministry said Tuesday.
   The five-year bonds, issued in 1983, will be paid between May
1990 and June 1992, according to the government's Official Gazette
of June 14. The bonds had originally been scheduled to mature in
June of this year.
   The notes subject to postponement are held by Venezuelan
government entities, and their non-payment should not affect the
nation's credit rating, foreign bankers in Caracas said.
   The government paid off another $100 million in Republic of
Venezuela bonds maturing this year that were held by private
investors, a Finance Ministry source said.
   The payment delay comes as the government attempts to safeguard
its reserves of foreign currencies in the face of declining oil
income. Finance Minister Hector Hurtado has estimated that
Venezuela will have a balance-of-payments deficit this year of
around $4 billion.
   Hurtado is in Washington this week for meetings with the world
banking community, the ministry said. He is scheduled to meet with
officials of the World Bank and the InterAmerican Development Bank,
and will sign a $71.6 million IADB credit for road repair.

<HEAD>Merrill Lynch Net Off 36 Percent In Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Merrill Lynch & Co. on Tuesday said lower
financial activity contributed to a 36 percent drop in its
second-quarter profit.
   Merrill Lynch, one of the nation's largest investment houses,
said net income totaled $53.5 million, or 47 cents a share, in the
second quarter, compared with earnings of $83.3 million, or 75
cents a share, a year ago.
   Revenue during the quarter rose 8 percent, to $2.5 billion from
$2.3 billion in the second quarter of 1987.
   William Schreyer, chairman and chief executive officer, said the
results were ``reasonable considering the difficult business
environment experienced during the quarter.''
   He said the period was marked by ``a relatively lower level of
activity in the financial markets.''
   Commission revenues in the second quarter declined 35 percent to
$393 million ``due to reduced stock market activity,'' the company
said in a statement.
   Investment banking revenue also declined _ down 13 percent to
$256 million _reflecting a lower level of mergers and acqusitions
closings.
   But record fixed-income activity drove principal transaction
revenue to $388 million, compared with a loss of $133 million a
year ago.
   Insurance revenues of $85 million and asset management and
custodial fee revenues of $122 million were little changed from the
previous year.
   Daniel Tully, president and chief operating officer, said the
company is confident ``the cost-control and productivity
improvement measures put into place during the first half are on
course.''
   For the first six months of 1988, net earnings totaled $122
million, or $1.08, off 36 percent from $192 million, or $1.72 a
share in the first half of 1987.
   Revenue for the first six months totaled $4.9 billion, up 1
percent from $4.8 billion in the year-ago period.

   Eastern Airlines management was unimpressed with a
four-year contract offer from its pilots, who claim they are
offering $51.5 million a year in cost savings to the airline, an
Eastern spokesman said Tuesday.
   ``The arithmetic they (the pilots) used totally distorts the
proposal,'' Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said. ``The main point
(is) they've hit us with a proposal that would increase our costs.''
   He said Eastern's calculations have found that the pilots'
proposal would increase the airline's costs by $116 million
annually. Matell added that overall, cumulative increases in the
pilots' offer would raise Eastern's costs by 33 percent.
   The pilots contended that the 5 percent increases in pay, along
with stock, they are requesting would be more than offset by
money-saving concessions in productivity rules and vacations.
   ``It would give (Eastern) some form of economic relief and at
the same time, protect our pilots,'' said spokesman J.B. Stokes of
the Air Line Pilots Association local representing about 3,500
Eastern pilots. ``We think it's very fair.''
   Eastern, losing an estimated $1 million daily, has said it must
have wage and work-rule concessions from its three unions to cut
labor costs by around 30 percent overall. The pilots' current
contract became amendable this month.
   Eastern has been in federal mediation with its largest union,
the 12,000-member Machinists, for nearly seven months.
   The pilots' proposal was designed to halt a ``downsizing'' of
Eastern that's seen a steady reduction in the number of flights.
The pilots estimate that by summer's end, nearly 1,000 Eastern
pilots will have left the airline since the 1986 takeover by giant
Texas Air Corp. _ many because of tense labor-management relations
and uncertainty about the carrier's future.
   The pilots' proposal would include a ``fence agreement'' keeping
Eastern separate from Continental Airlines, a nonunion carrier also
owned by Houston-based Texas Air. Eastern unions say Texas Air
wants to strip Eastern of its assets.
   The pilots' offer also calls for three 5 percent pay increases
and one 3 percent raise, plus shares in Texas Air stock, over the
life of the proposed four-year contract.
   One of the most critical proposals involves payment of an
unspecified amount of money to pilots who have yet to take a
vacation this year, the pilots said. Pilots would receive five days
of vacation and be compensated for the rest. Those pilots who have
taken a vacation this year would receive an unspecified amount of
cash for any remaining vacation time due them.
   This proposal alone would save Eastern $11 million, according to
ALPA.
   But Matell said it would be cheaper to hire new pilots.
   ``The pilot shortage thing is a myth. We have enough pilots to
fly the schedule we intend to operate,'' Matell said.
   Under the present contract, a pilot can fly 84 hours per month.
Under the proposal, that would rise to 88 hours and go as high as
90 hours under a so-called buffer provision.
   That provision, according to ALPA, would save the airline
another $9.5 millon annually. But Matell said the pilots want
time-and-a-half for the extra hours.
   A third element that would make more efficient use of the pilots
would save the company another $31 million yearly, ALPA said.
Matell said Eastern calculated the savings at only $6.7 million.
   Stokes, after hearing of Matell's remarks, said ALPA stands by
its calculations.
   ``That's certainly not the way it prints out,'' Stokes said of
Eastern's figures.
   ``We felt and still do that it's a very positive approach that
would save the company some money,'' Stokes said, adding that the
pilots' other priorities include maintaining Eastern as a large,
separate airline.
   He said Eastern management hasn't presented its own offer.
   ``They have not made a formal proposal as yet. That's just
delaying the negotiations,'' said Stokes.

   Stock prices fell today as investors showed
concern over interest rates and the trade deficit.
   Stock market investors have dwelled lately on the possibility
that the Federal Reserve will push up interest rates as a way to
cool the economy and stave off inflation.
   Concerns about rising interest rates have dampened the stock
market because more attractive yields on bonds could siphon money
away from stocks. Also, high rates could hurt stock prices by
slowing economic growth.
   A rise in agricultural commodity prices raised inflation fears,
which hurt the bond market, analysts said.
   ``This is a market that's back-pedaling,'' said Alan Ackerman,
an investment strategist for Gruntal & Co. ``Anxiety over higher
interest rates is keeping players on the sidelines as well as
stalling some of the summer sizzle that appears to lie ahead.''
   Traders also appeared cautious in advance of Friday's release of
figures on the May merchandise trade deficit.

<HEAD>Amoco to Build Two Chemical Plants in Southeast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amoco Corp.'s chemical subsidiary will spend
about $150 million to build a research center near Atlanta and a
high-performance carbon-fiber plant in Greenville, S.C., the energy
company said Tuesday.
   The 235,000-square-foot research-and-development center in
Georgia initially will employ about 300 people and is slated for
completion by late 1990, Amoco said in a statement.
   Scientists and engineers at the center will work on product
development and conduct research in carbon fibers, engineering
polymers and advanced composite materials, the company said.
   At Greenville, Amoco will expand its existing polyacrylonitrile
(PAN) and pitch carbon-fiber plant to expand production of PAN
carbon fibers. Demand for the fibers _ used to reinforce
lightweight synthetic materials _ is increasing in the aerospace,
industrial and sporting-goods industries, Amoco said.
   The first of three new production lines at the Greenville plant
is scheduled for start-up in early 1990, the company said. The
expansion is expected to boost employment at the plant from 430 to
nearly 650 over five years, said spokesman Richard Judy.
   Both projects will be handled by Amoco Performance Products
Inc., a unit of Amoco Chemical Co.
   ``A total investment in these two projects of more than $150
million is part of Amoco Chemical's long-term strategy to improve
our already excellent profitability through product innovation,
high-technology research and expansion of capacity to sustain our
competitive advantage,'' said Robert D. Cadieux, president of Amoco
Chemical.

<DATELINE>MONTVALE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. Inc.
reported a 25 percent increase in its first-quarter earnings over
last year, a gain the company attributed to strict cost controls
and a better product mix.
   The surpermarket giant reported net income of $38 million, or $1
a share, for the quarter ended June 18, compared to $30.4 million,
or 80 cents a share, for the same period in 1987.
   Sales for the latest quarter rose 3.5 percent to $3 billion from
$2.9 billion in the same quarter last year.
   The growth resulted from ``strict cost controls and improving
profit margins through better product mix in more efficient
stores,'' said James Wood, A&P's chairman and chief executive.
   ``We continue to make market share progress in most of our major
operational areas, except the South,'' he said. A&P has closed a
number of stores in the South because ``depressed economic
conditions'' have hurt their sales, Wood said.
   Under a $200 million 1988 capital spending program, five new
stores have opened during the quarter and 20 stores have been
enlarged or remodeled, he said. The company plans a total of 36 new
stores and 100 remodelings in 1988.

   The dollar slipped Tuesday, as profit-taking
pushed the currency lower against all major currencies except the
Canadian dollar.
   Gold prices were mixed. Republic National Bank in New York
quoted a late bid for gold of $436.25 as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from
Monday's late bid of $434.50.
   Traders said they had expected a slight sell-off of the dollar,
which rose to recent highs against several major currencies on
Monday despite concerted central bank intervention.
   Concern that the central banks might step in again to sell
dollars may have kept the currency from climbing, analysts said.
   The dollar's slow, measured decline began early in Tokyo and
then continued when trading shifted to Europe. In New York, the
currency settled at the lows of the day.
   But traders said bullish sentiment surrounding the U.S. currency
remains intact. ``The dollar hasn't dropped very far _ there's
still very good demand in the market,'' said Stephen Flanagan, an
assistant vice president at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   ``People are re-examining what's ahead of us and squaring up
their positions,'' he said, referring to the government's report on
the nation's May trade deficit, which is due out Friday.
   The consensus is that the May report will register about $11
billion, up from the $9.9 billion deficit reported for April, which
was the lowest imbalance in three years.
   In the past, the dollar has plunged in response to an unexpected
widening of the trade gap and soared when it narrowed.
   But Craig Sloane, a currency analyst at Smith Barney, Harris
Upham & Co., noted that the trade numbers were more of an obsession
earlier in the year.
   ``The dollar has made big moves without the trade numbers, and
the trend to a much stronger dollar has become much more visible in
the last few months,'' he said.
   Sloane said the dollar might be influenced by comments by
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who is scheduled to
testify before the Senate Banking Committee on monetary policy
Thursday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.63 Japanese yen to a closing 132.70 yen.
Later in London, it was slightly lower at 132.63 yen. In New York,
the dollar closed at 132.51 yen, down from 133.07 yen on Monday.
   In London, the British pound closed at $1.6960, up from $1.6900
late Monday. In New York, it cost $1.6970 to buy one pound, more
expensive than Monday's $1.6925.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Monday, included: 1.8365 West German marks, down from 1.8423;
1.5187 Swiss francs, down from 1.5305; 6.1970 French francs, down
from 6.2065; 1,361.75 Italian lire, down from 1,367.25, and 1.2103
Canadian dollars, up from 1.2072.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday:
1.8376 West German marks, down from 1.8460; 1.5235 Swiss francs,
down from 1.5350; 6.1940 French francs, down from 6.2080; 2.0745
Dutch guilders, down from 2.0750; 1,363.25 Italian lire, down from
1,364.50, and 1.2100 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2080.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, one troy ounce of gold cost
$437, up from $434.60 on Monday.
   In Europe, gold closed in London at a late bid of $436.50 a troy
ounce, up from $435.10 late Monday. But in Zurich, gold fell $2 to
a bid of $433.50 a troy ounce. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell
$4.41 to close at a bid $437.63.
   Silver bullion rose on New York's Comex to $6.974 a troy ounce
from $6.937 on Monday. In London the metal finished at a bid price
of $6.91 a troy ounce, down from $6.94 bid late Monday.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Prices Rise in Advance of Crop Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices moved moderately higher Tuesday
on the Chicago Board of Trade in cautious dealings ahead of the
Agriculture Department's eagerly awaited monthly crop report.
   Analysts said the report, released after trading ended and
forecasting a 24 percent decline in overall U.S. grain production,
should send prices higher when trading resumes on Wednesday.
   But they say weather forecasts will continue to dominate the
markets.
   On other markets, livestock and meat futures were mixed; energy
futures were mixed; precious metals were higher and stock-index
futures retreated.
   Grain analysts called the crop report bullish for soybean
prices, bearish for corn and slightly bearish for wheat. But the
anticipated strength in soybeans was expected to offset the
weakness in the grains, ultimately pulling all the grain markets
higher Wednesday _ at least for a few minutes.
   ``After about three minutes of trading, they'll have worked off
their report anxiety and we'll be looking at Friday's, Saturday's
and Sunday's weather, which we see as hot, hot, hot,'' said Walter
Spilka, a grain analyst in New York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham
& Co.
   ``I don't think the market's going to dwell on this report too
long,'' agreed Joel Karlin, chief research analyst with Research
Department Inc. in Chicago.
   Based on conditions as of Tuesday, the USDA predicted a 27
percent drop in corn production from 1987, a 14 percent drop in
soybean production, and a wheat crop 13 percent smaller than that
harvested last year.
   The corn harvest was estimated at 5.2 billion bushels, compared
with the June estimate of 7.3 billion and year-ago production of
7.06 billion.
   The USDA estimated 1988 soybean production at 1.65 billion
bushels, compared with a June estimate of 1.88 billion and 1987
production of 1.9 billion bushels.
   Production of all U.S. wheat was projected at 1.84 billion
bushels, compared with the June estimate of 2.12 billion and 1987
production of 2.1 billion.
   Analysts called the corn and wheat estimates conservative.
   ``This just confirms everybody's opinion that there's some crop
damage out there, and the USDA is looking at a bit more of a
problem in soybeans than the trade had anticipated,'' Spilka said.
   This year's planted soybean acreage, estimated by the USDA at
58.52 million acres, was about 700,000 acres below market
expectations. Planted corn acreage, estimated at 67.52 million
acres, was about 500,000 acres more than expected.
   Grain and soybean futures advanced moderately ahead of the
report, which was issued after the markets closed.
   Wheat settled 8} cents to 13\ cents higher with the contract for
delivery in July at $3.81\ a bushel; corn was 8\ cents to 17} cents
higher with July at $3.06 a bushel; oats were 1{ cents lower to 15
cents higher with July at $2.79 a bushel; soybeans were 7 cents to
21{ cents higher with July at $8.79{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures finished mixed while some pork futures advanced
their daily limits on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in reaction
to the rise in feed grain prices, said Dale Durchholz, a
pork-market analyst with AgriVisor Services Inc. in Bloomington,
Ill.
   Traders expect livestock and meat prices to rise sharply next
year after falling in the near term due to widespread producer
selling of animals this summer because of the drought-driven rise
in feed prices, he said.
   The USDA also reported the worst July 1 pasture conditions in
history, which should encourage further drought-pattern trading on
the livestock markets, said Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling
Analytical Services Inc. in Arlington Heights, Ill.
   Live cattle settled .70 cent lower to .17 cent higher with
August at 65.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .60
cent lower with August at 75.72 cents a pound; hogs were .20 cent
to the limit 1.50 cents higher with July at 45.67 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .40 cent to the limit 2 cents higher with
July at 33.10 cents a pound.
   Crude oil prices weakened in volatile trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, but unleaded gasoline strengthened because of
tight supplies and speculation about higher U.S. demand, analysts
said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 6 cents to 17 cents
lower with August at $14.72 a barrel; heating oil was .15 cent to
.68 cent lower with August at 40.65 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .06 cent lower to 1.35 cents higher with August at
53.48 cents a gallon.
   Precious metals futures posted modest gains on New York's
Commodity Exchange due to the inflationary implications of higher
grain prices and a weaker dollar.
   Gold settled $2 to $2.30 higher with August at $438.70 a troy
ounce; silver was 3.7 cents to 3.8 cents higher with July at $6.974
a troy ounce.
   Stock-index futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for September delivery of the Standard
& Poor's 500 index settled 3.10 points lower at 269.35.

   Cullum Cos., a Dallas-based food and drug
retailer, said Tuesday a management-led investor group was offering
to take the company private in a $361 million leveraged buyout.
   Cullum said the investor group, Cullum Acquisition Corp., which
includes the investment banker Morgan Stanley & Co., was offering
$22 a share for Cullum's 16.4 million outstanding shares, or a
total of $361 million.
   In a statement, the retailer said major Cullum stockholders,
including management and Cullum family members, were granting
Cullum Acquisition an option to purchase their shares for $22 each.
   Cullum stock closed at $21.75 Tuesday in over-the-counter
trading, up $1.25 a share.
   The leveraged buyout must be approved by the Cullum board and
was subject to execution of a definitive agreement, the statement
said. In a leveraged buyout, investors borrow heavily to buy out a
company and then pay off the debt with the target company's cash
flow or the sale of its assets.
   Cullum Acquisition said it had commitments for the financing
required for the buyout.
   Cullum Cos. operates 83 retail outlets, including supermarkets
and Hypermart USA, a Garland, Texas hypermarket run as a joint
venture with Wal-Mart Stores Inc.

<DATELINE>SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anacomp Inc., an Indiana-based
computer services company, has signed a letter of intent to
purchase the disk-drive maker Xidex Corp. for about $415 million in
cash, the companies announced Tuesday.
   Indianapolis-based Anacomp, the third largest supplier of
micrographics products in the United States behind 3M Corp. and
Eastman Kodak Co., said it will pay $10 for each of Xidex's 41.5
million outstanding shares.
   The transaction, which requires the approval of both boards of
directors, will result in a company with annual sales of about $1
billion. A definitive agreement is expected to be reached by the
end of the month, the companies said in a statement.
   A spokeswoman for Anacomp, which is a customer of Xidex, said
the Santa Clara company is well managed and makes a good fit.
   ``Anacomp generally looks for a repetitive revenue base in
making such acquisitions,'' said spokeswoman Jo McKee. ``We think
we have a very solid marketing and distribution network that can
maybe boost some of their other businesses.''
   She said it is too soon to comment on whether layoffs would
follow the merger.
   Xidex climbed $1.37{ a share to $9 in the over-the-counter
trading, while Anacomp fell $1.12{ a share to close at $9.87{ on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   Xidex, which has posted losses for two straight years due to
writeoffs on acquisitions, is a leading manufacturer of computer
data storage. It controls 25 percent of the world floppy disk
market and also makes computer output microfilm, microfilm readers
and reader printers.
   An analyst who follows both companies called the announcement a
``very attractive'' deal for both sides.
   ``The combined company will have $1 billion worth of annual
sales, a capital base of around $800 million and very strong cash
flows,'' said Mark Obenzinger of Wood, Gundy & Associates in New
York.
   ``You have a strong company in place as far as the competition
is concerned,'' he added.
   Xidex spokesman Steve Bennion said Chief Executive Officer Bert
L. Zaccaria had no comment.
   Anacomp, which employs more than 3,000 people, is a supplier and
manufacturer of services and products based on micro-imaging
technology known as micrographics.
   For the six months ended in March, Anacomp reported net income
of $22.8 million, or 59 cents a share, on revenues of $200.9
million. Obenzinger estimated the company's profits will reach
$45.5 million on revenues of about $400 million in the current
fiscal year.
   Xidex has 7,000 employees worldwide, about half in the San
Francisco Bay area at factories in Santa Clara, Sunnyvale and
Fremont. It also operates factories in Irvine; Omaha, Neb.; Iron
Ridge, Wis.; and Wales, Britain.
   For the nine months ended March 31, the company had a net loss
of $74 million on sales of $467 million.

<TEXT>
   Martin Marietta Corp. will buy
Illinois-based Gould Inc.'s antisubmarine warfare unit for an
undisclosed sum, the companies announced Tuesday.
   The companies said they expect the purchase of the Ocean Systems
Division, which employs 1,300 workers, to be completed within 30 to
90 days.
   The Glen Burnie plant, with revenues of about $100 million in
1987, is the latest Gould defense operation to be sold under a
wide-ranging restructuring begun two years ago when Gould decided
to get out of the defense business.
   In January, Gould said it would sell its 1,200-worker
heavyweight torpedo operation in Cleveland to Westinghouse Electric
Corp. for about $100 million.
   The company last year sold three other smaller defense
operations. One last unit, NavCom Systems Division in El Monte,
Calif., is still up for sale.
   Originally known as Chesapeake Instrument Corp., the Glen Burnie
operation was purchased by Gould in 1974. It specializes in
antisubmarine warfare, especially towed sonar arrays, which are
underwater listening devices towed behind Navy ships submarines and
used to listen for enemy submarines.
   The Glen Burnie operation also makes array handling equipment,
marine navigation equipment and other kinds of sensors.
   Martin Marietta's 4,500-worker Aero and Naval Systems operation
in Middle River is already involved in some antisubmarine warfare
work, company officials said.
   Gould is based in Rolling Meadow, Ill.; Martin Marietta is
headquartered in Bethesda, Md.

   Tropicana Products, Inc. announced
Tuesday a truce in its orange juice war with the Coca-Cola Co.
   A settlement between the companies resolves a court dispute over
Tropicana's challenge of Coke's claim that its Minute Maid
``Premium Choice'' orange juice was ``straight from the orange.''
   Tropicana filed a request for an injunction July 1 at federal
court in New York, charging Minute Maid's claim on its package was
false and deceptive based on a 1982 U.S. Court of Appeals decision
about advertising pasteurized orange juice.
   ``Not until Tropicana filed suit did Coca-Cola agree to modify
its advertising and labeling to delete that claim,'' Tropicana said
in a prepared statement.
   Coca-Cola confirmed it has agreed to change its package label.
   ``Under the settlement, Coca-Cola Foods has agreed to
voluntarily remove the phrase `straight from the orange' on its
future packaging,'' Coke said in a prepared statement.
   ``We are extremely pleased with the outcome of this suit,'' said
Pierre Ferrari, a Coca-Cola senior vice president.
   ``Tropicana places a great deal of importance upon truthful
consumer communications, and we are pleased that The Coca-Cola Co.
has recognized its responsiblity to the consumer and has agreed to
those changes in its Minute Maid advertising and labeling,'' said
Martin J. Gutfreund, a Tropicana vice president.

   Lotus Development Corp. on Tuesday
announced the release of its Lotus Agenda software designed to help
people manage personal information.
   The company said the software allows users to organize personal
minutiae such as ideas, notes, lists, messages, telephone numbers,
addresses and schedules in a variety of categories.
   Development of the software began about 10 months ago, but the
idea belonged to Lotus founder Mitchell D. Kapor, who would
scribble notes and stuff them in his shirt pocket, only to lose
them.
   Lotus said its development program included more than 150
corporate and individual testers. Agenda is being credited as
creating a new category of applications software called personal
information management.
   The company said Agenda allows users to enter information ``on
the fly,'' assign it to different categories as desired and observe
it from multiple perspectives.
   Categories might include tasks, departments, people, issues.
Lotus Agenda can be used to manage sales accounts, projects and
calendars, examine news clips or just keep a list, the company said.
   Lotus Agenda is priced at $395 and is available immediately.
   The software runs under DOS 2.0 or higher on IBM PC, XT, AT and
PS-2 or compatible personal computers.

<HEAD>Bentsen Receives Praise from Labor Despite Poor Union Rating</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also mocving on general news wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen has the worst lifetime
voting record on labor issues of any of the running mates Michael
Dukakis was considering, according to an AFL-CIO rating.
Nevertheless, union lobbyists on Tuesday were quick to praise the
Democratic choice.
   The Texas Democrat was hailed for his role in salvaging labor's
top legislative priority this year _ making companies give workers
60 days advance notice before closing their plants or laying them
off.
   ``Bentsen was extremely helpful in recognizing that the two _
plant closing notices and the trade bill _ were compatible,'' said
Robert McGlotten, the 14.1-million-member labor federation's
legislative director. ``And he let his colleagues know how he
felt.''
   The Senate last week passed with a veto-proof 72-vote majority
legislation requiring companies to provide 60 days advance notice
of plant closings or layoffs involving more than 50 people. The
House is expected to follow suit on Wednesday.
   Labor leaders demanded enactment of the mandatory layoff notices
as the price for maintaining their support for a massive
overhauling of the nation's trade laws that Bentsen was a key
player in crafting as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
   Reagan vetoed the trade bill in May, citing the layoff notices
that were then a part of it as his primary reason.
   James Booe, secretary-treasurer of the Communications Workers of
America, and a member of the Democrats' platform-drafting
committee, acknowledged that Bentsen was not labor's main spear
carrier on the trade and plant closing issues.
   ``But he didn't do a lot of the things that he could have done
to mess us up, and there were a lot of other people urging him
to,'' said Booe. ``I don't think you can call him a labor hero, but
he's been on our side more than he's been against us.''
   As a three-term senator from a right-to-work state where less
than 12 percent of the workers belong to unions, Bentsen has always
walked a fine line between conservative businessmen and labor
activists in the Democratic Party.
   Despite a lifetime voting record of only 51 percent on labor
issues, according to the AFL-CIO's Committee on Political
Education, Texas labor leaders endorsed his re-election in 1982.
   All of the five other members of Congress who Dukakis was
considering as possible running mates have stronger COPE voting
records. Another southerner, Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee, had the
highest _ 88 percent.
   But Bentsen was listed as voting ``right'' on eight of 10 issues
in 1987 that the AFL-CIO considered in compiling its rankings,
shoring up his support among labor leaders.
   Bentsen's only wrong votes were on raising the threshold on
government construction contracts for which union-scale wages must
be paid and giving employers who hire illegal aliens extensions
before fining them.
   ``He's been all over the map,'' said Steve Kerekes, a spokesman
for the National Right to Work Committee, a group that advocates
state laws like the one in Texas which outlaws labor contracts that
require non-members to pay dues to unions that represent them.
   Earlier this year, Bentsen came out against a so-called
double-breasting bill that is the top priority of construction
unions. The bill would prohibit unionized companies from operating
non-union subsidiaries as a means of getting around wage and other
provisions of labor contracts they've signed.
   But last month he voted against a measure to make violence on
picket lines a federal crime, a reversal of his vote two years ago
favoring such legislation.
   AFL-CIO members hold 751 of the 4,161 delegates at the
Democratic convention opening next week in Atlanta. Combined with
the National Education Associations' 280 delegates, about
one-fourth of total that will nominate Dukakis and Bentsen come
from the labor movement.
   ``Obviously, we would like to see somebody who had a 100 percent
voting record,'' said McGlotten. ``But as you review things, a COPE
record becomes less important than whether someone's door is open
to us and understands our problems. He understands our problems.''

<HEAD>Steelmakers' Costs Up Because of Drought, But Orders May Be Cut
Later</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GARY, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The steel industry faces a possible reduction
in orders as the drought reduces harvests and cuts the demand for
new farm equipment, industry representatives said Tuesday.
   The drought also has increased operating costs by forcing
steelmakers to contract for smaller, lighter ore barge loads that
can navigate shallower waters near the Minnesota ore ranges.
   Steelmakers add, however, the drought likely will not harm the
industry's recovery and the generally strong market for steel.
   USX Corp.'s Gary Works produces tin-plated steel, among other
products, for the canning industry, and Inland Steel Corp., which
operates a facility in East Chicago, supplies steel to farm
machinery manufacturers.
   ``There's some talk that canners, if the crops are lower, will
be canning less, and that could have an effect on shipment,'' said
USX spokesman George Kuebler. ``Harvest time is still down the road
for a lot of crops yet, so we don't see any impact.''
   An Inland newsletter said the company anticipates some customers
might cut back on orders if the drought continues.
   ``Farm equipment manufacturers, in particular, may be hurt by
declining sales of tractors and combines,'' the newsletter said.
   Inland spokesman George Nekvasil said some companies that depend
on river traffic stalled by drought-lowered waters may reduce steel
orders if they can't move their own finished products to market.
   Kuebler said smaller ore loads increase shipping costs by about
10 percent. That has not yet translated into an increase in steel
prices, he said.
   Nevertheless, orders for steel remain strong, said Nekvasil.
   ``We continue to see business conditions strong,'' he said. ``I
certainly wouldn't see anything that would threaten recovery or
profitability. There's a very strong market for steel today.''

<TEXT>
   IC Industries, the diversified producer of Pet
food products and Midas mufflers, said Tuesday its second-quarter
profit climbed 21 percent on an 18 percent revenue gain.
   IC reported net income of $55.8 million, or 52 cents a share,
for the three months ended June 30, compared with $46 million, or
41 cents a share, for the same period a year ago.
   Second-quarter revenue increased to $857.7 million from $729
million, the company said.
   IC's soft-drinks division, including its Pepsi-Cola General
Bottlers joint venture with Pepsico Inc., was the most improved
sector with sales of nearly $237 million, a 54 percent increase
from a year ago.
   The earnings include the results of two companies listed by IC
as discontinued operations: the Illinois Central Railroad Co.,
which is being spun off as a separate company; and Pneumo Abex, an
aircraft-parts maker, which is being sold.
   For the first six months of this year, IC had net income of
$96.5 million, or 90 cents a share, compared with net income of
$74.9 million, or 66 cents a share, a year earlier.
   First-half sales rose to $1.6 billion from $1.4 billion in 1987.

<TEXT>
   Lawmakers unveiled a wide-ranging relief bill
for America's drought-stricken farmers Tuesday, promising payments
of up to $100,000 to keep them on the land despite the withering
heat and lack of rain.
   The legislation is expected to move quickly through Congress.
The chairmen of both the House and Senate Agriculture committees
vowed to move as rapidly as possible and Agriculture Secretary
Richard E. Lyng said that because of the extent of the drought, the
Reagan administration will overlook minor flaws in the bill and
support the measure.
   ``This is the largest drought that our nation has ever
experienced,'' Lyng declared as senators met to start committee
action on the disaster legislation.
   ``I think history will show that it's truly more mammoth than
any of us has ever experienced,'' Lyng said. He said a recurrence
next year would ``suggest that we've done something wrong and the
Gods are against us.''
   Lawmakers did not give an estimate of the cost of the relief
legislation but expressed their resolve not to allow drought to set
off a rash of bankruptcies in the countryside, just as the farm
economy is shaking off the painful stagnation of the early 1980s.
   ``We're not going to allow their lives as farmers and ranchers
to end because of a freak of nature,'' Senate Agriculture Committee
Chairman Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., said.
   Both the Senate and House Agriculture committees opened hearings
on the bill on Tuesday.
   The chairman of the House panel, Rep. E. ``Kika'' de la Garza,
D-Texas, said it ``would send the wrong signal'' to leave the job
unfinished in August when lawmakers flee Washington's heat. He
added that he was hopeful the panel could dispense with any parade
of witnesses from farm lobbies and instead act this week on any
changes congressmen want to make in the draft bill.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., also called for ``quick
action'' on the legislation because the ``American farmer needs
help. It's that simple.''
   ``We must make certain that our relief package is targeted to
those who need the help,'' Dole said in a statement. ``There can be
no windfalls for any individual or group. We owe that much to the
farmers and the taxpayers.''
   Lyng was briefing House members on the long, hot dry spell when
aides arrived from the Agriculture Department five blocks away with
a fresh forecast that the drought would cut this year's corn output
to around 5.2 billion bushels, down from 7.06 billion last year.
   Under the proposed legislation, disaster payments would be
capped at $100,000 for each individual farmer. Payments would
represent 65 percent of pre-drought expected earnings, whether from
target prices, price-support loans or market prices. But they would
apply only to losses in excess of 35 percent of the crop.
   A 50 cent reduction per hundredweight in dairy price supports
scheduled to start next year would be canceled under the
legislation. Dairymen say such an action is warranted by
skyrocketing feed costs, although it was one of their prime goals
long before the drought set in.
   Government emergency feed programs already in effect would be
overhauled and made available to a broader range of farmers. The
drought has burned away a considerable amount of hay and thus put
feed at a premium.
   Wheat, feed grains, cotton and rice producers would not be
required to refund to the government any deficiency payments they
have received in advance. The income-support payments represent the
difference between the market value of their harvest and its value
at higher, so-called target prices set by Congress under the 1985
farm program and adjusted annually by the secretary of agriculture.
   Market prices have climbed steadily closer to target prices in
anticipation of a diminished harvest, and thus the drought has
reduced federal income-support payments as well. The drying up of
these subsidies at a time when farmers have fewer crops to take to
market threatens to hurt some of them.
   To complicate matters, many farmers have received 40 percent of
their deficiency payments from the Department of Agriculture in
advance and will have to refund a portion of them unless rescued by
relief legislation.
   Another key provision would help farmers convert from production
of corn, cotton and a variety of other crops to soybean production
without paying certain financial penalties under the farm program.
   The provision is being closely watched in the farm and segments
of the financial communities because soybeans are expected to be in
short supply as a result of the drought and prices already are
soaring.

   Caterpillar Inc. posted a second-quarter
profit of $145 million on Tuesday, a 23 percent increase over the
same period a year earlier.
   The $145 million profit for second-quarter amounted to $1.44 a
share, compared with a profit of $118 million, or $1.20 a share, in
the same period last year.
   Second-quarter sales rose to $2.6 billion, up 26 percent from
$2.1 billion a year earlier.
   For the first half of the year, Caterpillar earned $263 million,
or $2.60 a share, compared to $34 million, or 35 cents per share,
for the first half of 1987.
   First-half revenue rose to $4.98 billion from $3.74 billion a
year earlier.
   Polzin said Caterpillar achieved record sales and robust profit
levels despite higher costs for materials such as steel, and
problems caused by a weakening of the U.S. dollar overseas.
   The world's largest manufacturer of earth-moving equipment
finished in the black for the fifth consecutive quarter and said it
expects company sales for the year will ``substantially exceed
sales in 1987.''
   Caterpillar spokesman Mark Polzin said 1987 sales of $8.18
billion represented the company's best performance since 1981, when
it had record sales of $9.15 billion.
   Only three months ago, the company said its sales would match
the growth which occurred in 1987.
   ``Economic growth will be faster this year than assumed
earlier,'' Polzin said. ``And replacement demand will be stronger
than expected.''
   Polzin said Caterpillar also is commanding higher prices than
expected for its products and pleased with the acceptance of
several recently introduced models.
   Caterpillar is rebuilding from a market collapse in 1981 which
led to three years of losses that amounted to $950 million.
   A general overcapacity in the industry and fierce competition at
home and abroad combined during the early 1980s to hurt Caterpillar.
   The company has fought back to financial health with a
cost-cutting program. Savings were made by closing plants and
massive layoffs, including slashing its Peoria-area workforce in
half, eliminating about 18,000 positions.

<HEAD>USG Settles Lawsuit Against Merrill Lynch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USG Corp. said Tuesday it had reached an
out-of-court settlement of its 2-month-old lawsuit charging Merrill
Lynch & Co. with attempting to profit from the illegal use of
confidential information.
   USG, the country's leading producer of gypsum wallboard and
other building materials, would not reveal the terms of the
agreement.
   The lawsuit, filed May 3 in U.S. District Court in Chicago,
stemmed from Merrill Lynch's involvement in an attempted hostile
takeover of USG by Desert Partners L.P., a partnership headed by
oilmen Cyril Wagner Jr. and Jack E. Brown of Midland, Texas.
   USG had accused the New York investment house of providing
Desert Partners with confidential information acquired while
Merrill Lynch served as USG's financial adviser in prior business
deals.
   Merrill Lynch denied any conflict in its involvement with Desert
Partners, which withdrew its takeover bid on June 9 after losing a
proxy fight for six seats on USG's board of directors.
   Merrill Lynch was one of Desert Partners' financial advisers in
its takeover attempt and had committed $200 million of its own
money to assist in the proposed takeover.

<HEAD>Harvard Business School To Require Ethics Course This Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Honesty and fairness will be in the curriculum at
Harvard Business School starting this fall, when all students
entering the graduate school will be required to take a three-week
course in ethics.
   After the Wall Street insider trading scandal broke in 1986, the
nation's business schools, Harvard included, were criticized for
not stressing ethics in their teachings of future business managers.
   ``We want to send a signal early on that these issues are
important to the organization,'' Thomas Piper, one of the
professors who will teach the course at Harvard, said in Tuesday's
editions of the Boston Globe.
   Piper defined the teaching of ethics as instilling the values of
respect, honesty, trust and fairness and said the key was to show
that ethics are part of the decision-making process for managers.
   The ungraded course will begin the second week of the term. The
school also plans to have more discussion of ethics in its regular
courses and has hired research assistants to develop material.
Workshops will be held for faculty members.
   Fewer than 10 percent of business schools require students to
take ethics, according to ethics specialist Michael Hoffman of
Bentley College.
   Last year, Harvard received $20 million from former Securities
and Exchange Commission Chairman John Shad for the teaching of
ethics.
   Harvard's critics, including some faculty members, had
questioned the school's commitment to teaching ethics. Some critics
suggested at the time of Shad's gift that Harvard got interested in
the subject only when it got the money.
   The school countered that ethics already were taught in many of
its regular courses and a separate course was not needed.
   Piper told the Globe that after one year of study, Harvard
decided on a dual approach _ a separate mini-course and more
discussion of ethics in other courses.
   He said ethics always had been taught at Harvard but may have
been squeezed out over time. Interest in doing more came before the
Wall Street scandal, he said, but the scandal made people realize
``that the pendulum may have swung too far.''
   Last year, Harvard University President Derek Bok told the Globe
he did not think professors at the business school ``are able to
put ethics into their courses at the level they should.''
   ``There is a dangerous tendency on the part of some people to
say that ethics is something we all know about,'' Bok said.
