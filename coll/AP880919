<HEAD>American To Build First Soviet Memorial To Jews Killed in
Holocaust</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lithuanian-born American Arbit Blatas has returned
to his homeland to build the first Soviet monument to Jews killed
during World War II, his wife, former Metropolitan Opera star
Regina Resnik, said Monday.
   Lithuanian authorities chose Blatas to build the memorial in the
old Jewish section of the ancient city of Vilnius, the capital of
the republic on the Baltic Sea, said Miss Resnik.
   She said that Blatas, a Jewish sculptor and painter whose mother
died in a Nazi gas chamber, returned to Lithuania this month to
discuss with architects and Vilnius city officials plans for the
monument as part of the first Jewish state museum in the Soviet
Union.
   The monument will be similar to one Blatas built in New York
City on Dag Hammarskjold Plaza near the United Nations, she said.
   That monument depicts seven stages of the Holocaust, from
deportation of Jews to the ``Final Solution,'' Hitler's plan to
exterminate the Jews.
   Miss Resnik, now a Broadway actress, spoke in a telephone
interview from Vilnius.
   Hitler's Nazi forces are believed to have killed at least
220,000 Jews in Lithuania, all but wiping out the area's Jewish
population. Lithuania had one of the largest Jewish populations on
Soviet territory and was a Jewish cultural and scholarly center.
   Lithuanian Jewish activists began a campaign six months ago to
restore the Jewish ghetto of Vilnius, and work is now under way,
Miss Resnik said. Generally, Soviet officials portray Hitler's
attack as a common tragedy for all Soviet citizens and are
reluctant to acknowledge the especially heavy toll suffered by Jews.
   But Lithuanian authorities gave their blessing to the Holocaust
monument and museum, and several articles on the projects have
appeared in the state-run local press, Miss Resnik said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: NASA Prepares Shuttle With New Launch Philosophy</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Before the first shuttle flight in 1981, in
the white-knuckle days when space engineers still wondered if the
engines would fire and the heat shield would hold up for re-entry,
NASA had a launch schedule that seemed either very optimistic or
just plain crazy: 48 flights in five years.
   As recently as 1985, the agency was scheduling 24 flights in
1989 alone.
   Over the years, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration had given a proud name to its philosophy for such
ambitious planning: ``Success oriented.'' A skeptic would ask, how
can you expect to launch 24 missions in one year, and a NASA
official would respond, ``It's a success-oriented schedule, but
that's our goal.''
   Now, for the first post-Challenger launch, success-oriented has
given way to ``safety first.''
   Success-oriented is a system in which NASA sets a work schedule
that allows no coasting and presumes no delays. It's a sort of
Anti-Murphy's Law: If anything can go right, it will go right, and
at just the right time. In life-or-death circumstances, it is a
calculated method for achieving intensity, and maximum results,
from the limited tax resources available for spaceflight.
   Aim for 48, come as close as you can. (NASA flew 21 flights in
those first five years.)
   Before long, the real Murphy's Law often took over. The 24th
mission, with celebrity astronaut Rep. Bill Nelson on board, was
rescheduled a record seven times before the congressman and crew
finally was launched into space on Jan. 12, 1986. Landing was
delayed three times and then rerouted from Florida to California.
   The next flight went to Challenger, and its tragic end on Jan.
28, 1986, forced NASA to rethink and abandon the success-oriented
work routine.
   Instead, the agency moved slowly, cautiously and as quietly as
possible in preparing Discovery for its mission to end NASA's
32-month absence from spaceflight.
   NASA waited until this past Saturday to set its final launch
date: Thursday, Sept. 29, 9:59 a.m. EDT. At one point, the agency
was so intent on NOT setting a launch date that it cited a
hurricane off Texas _ not Florida _ to delay its announcement
another 48 hours.
   Success-oriented? Not this time.
   Yet, over the years, the NASA doctrine had its good days.
   Success oriented put Neil Armstrong on the moon.
   It is difficult today to recall how outlandish it seemed in 1961
when President Kennedy called on NASA to harness the ``dedication,
organization and discipline'' to put man on the moon by 1970.
America's space program was in its bumbling infancy. The Soviets
had humiliated the United States with Sputnik and then with Yuri
Gagarin. Alan Shepard had made a suborbital flight, but no American
had even orbited the Earth, let alone achieved any of the other
requirements (rendezvous, space walks, powerful new rocket engines,
lunar landing vehicles) that would allow NASA to realize Kennedy's
goal, ``before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and
returning him safely to the Earth.''
   NASA completed its Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs with a
success-oriented work regime that provided the United States some
of its proudest moments. The approach worked so well that even
after the Apollo 1 launch pad fire, while mourning three
astronauts, NASA quickly fixed the problem and the program moved
forward. A 32-month delay? It was beyond comprehension.
   By 1986, though, success-oriented may have been more of a
problem than a solution. The agency had always operated
conservatively, tolerating launch delays whatever the gentle
ridicule from the public or the media. But there came a tendency
among some NASA managers to maybe wink at some problems, among them
an inadequate booster rocket design. After seven scrubs for the
Bill Nelson launch, and two delays getting Challenger off the
ground, NASA rocketry managers didn't want to hear about O-rings on
the morning of Jan. 28, 1986. They wanted to launch, cold weather
or not.
   ``I'm appalled at your recommendation,'' a NASA rocket manager,
George Hardy, said in disgust to engineers who tried to block the
launch.
   It won't happen that way next week. Safety first will rule the
day.
   ``It wouldn't surprise me at all if it took us two or three
times to get airborne,'' says Richard Truly, the ex-astronaut who
now runs the NASA shuttle program. ``We're going to wait until we
have it right, and then we're going to do it.''

<HEAD>Reagan Adviser Said He Was `Out of Ammunition' in 1984 Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A political adviser to President Reagan
described him in 1984 as a candidate who had ``run out of
ammunition'' but whose strength was that he believed he couldn't be
held responsible for his own administration's record, according to
a tape-recorded account reported in a new book.
   The book, ``Landslide,'' by reporters Jane Mayer of the Wall
Street Journal and Doyle McManus of the Los Angeles Times,
describes a meeting of three Reagan advisers on June 30, 1984, in a
conference room of Reagan-Bush campaign headquarters.
   ``The meeting was highly confidential,'' the authors write.
``But in this case the discussion was tape recorded, and although
the participants intended that the tapes stay secret, they did
not.''
   The authors do not say how they obtained the tapes, which they
say ran for four hours.
   Stuart Spencer, a veteran Reagan strategist who chaired the
meeting, is quoted as saying at the outset, ``The problem is, we've
been talking to everybody at the White House over the past few days
_ and the Reagan administration fired all its bullets very early
and very successfully in the first two years.''
   ``All their plans, all their priorities, all their programs,''
said Spencer. ``They've run out of ammunition.''
   Spencer is now an adviser to Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, running
mate of Republican presidential nominee George Bush. Spencer did
not immediately return a telephone call Sunday seeking comment at
his office in California.
   Later in that June 1984 meeting, pollster Robert Teeter is
quoted as saying that although Reagan had run successfully as an
outsider in 1980, ``You might have a problem. People are beginning
to believe that what's in place in Washington is Ronald Reagan's.''
   Spencer, whose association with Reagan went back to his days as
governor of California in the 1960s and 1970s, replied, ``He can
pull it off. In 1970, he pulled it off.''
   In his campaign for re-election as governor, Spencer argued,
Reagan ``ran against the ... government he was running.''
   ``I mean, he believes he's above it all,'' said Spencer. ``He
believes it. That's why they believe it. I can't believe it. But
they do.''
   According to the book, the tape also shows the strategists
seeking to overcome first lady Nancy Reagan's resistance to having
the president do a two- or three-day campaign trip before the
Republican National Convention in August 1984.
   ``Her reasoning is, you don't put the actor onstage before the
show starts,'' Spencer is quoted as saying. ``She thinks the
convention is the show. I tried to make her see that you're talking
about two different shows, two different nights. I think I finally
got through to her.''
   The authors conclude that Mrs. Reagan, although the advisers did
not know it, evidently was relying on astrological advice. Her use
of an astrologer was revealed earlier this year by former White
House chief of staff Donald T. Regan in his book, ``For the
Record.''
   Teeter is quoted as saying on the tape that advisers to Reagan's
1984 opponent, Walter Mondale, were ``working on some examples that
he (Reagan) doesn't know what he's doing.''
   To counter this, Spencer suggested that the president give three
or four ``sophisticated speeches'' in which he would ``talk about
things like sound money, constitutional reform, education. Things
that when he gets through, people will think he sure as hell knows
something _ without really saying something.''
   Teeter also suggested presidential events with young people to
``help inoculate against the idea that he doesn't know what's going
on.''
   As the advisers sought issues for the campaign, the authors
write, the tapes show that Spencer suggested Reagan say something
about ``acid rain and all that stuff'' because he was perceived as
vulnerable on environmental issues.
   Speechwriter Ken Khachigian responded, ``We're better off
without it. If you get the old man going on it, he does `killer
trees.'''
   The ``killer trees'' phrase originated after Reagan expressed
the view, in his 1980 campaign, that trees cause air pollution.

<HEAD>Meat Consumption To Drop Next Year for First Time Since 1981</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time in seven years, Americans
will each consume a smaller portion of meat next year, averaging
about 2 percent less than they did in 1988, according to a forecast
by the Agriculture Department.
   The 1989 per capita forecast of red meat and poultry consumption
is 215.9 pounds, down from an estimated record of 220.1 pounds this
year.
   Overall, total red meat and poultry production is expected to
decline about 1 percent in 1989 from this year's record level.
Lower beef output and a leveling off in the pork and turkey supply
will more than offset increases in broiler production.
   Even so, U.S. total production of red meat and poultry is
expected to be the second largest on record.
   The per capita consumption estimates are all in retail weights,
reflecting cuts as they are sold to consumers. The weights do not
take into consideration further trimming or boning at home prior to
cooking, shrinkage during cooking, or table waste.
   Ron Gustafson of the department's Economic Research Service said
it will be the first time since 1982 that per capita meat
consumption has not matched or exceeded the previous year's average.
   In 1982, he said in a telephone interview Friday, the average
consumption of red meat and poultry was 201.8 pounds for each
American, down from 207 pounds in 1981.
   Looking at the 1989 projections, which were published in a newly
released outlook report by the agency, beef consumption is expected
to decline further to 66.7 pounds per capita from 71.8 pounds this
year.
   Pork consumption is expected to average 62.8 pounds per person
next year, down slightly from 63.7 in 1988.
   Including small amounts of veal, lamb and mutton, total red meat
consumption in 1989 is forecast at about 132.4 pounds per person,
down from 138.4 indicated for 1988. Total poultry, by comparison,
is expected to increase to around 83.6 pounds in 1989 from 81.7
this year.
   Although some of the decline in per capita red meat consumption
can be attributed to the health concerns of some consumers, USDA
officials say there are many other factors, including the economy
and how much money families have to spend on food. The cattle
cycle, with its patterns of supply buildup and then gradual
liquidation, is another factor.
   Gustafson said that still another recent factor has been the
closer trimming of retail cuts of beef since 1986. With more retail
stores removing much of the fat from beef cuts, there is less
moving into consumer use _ which reduces the poundage, compared
with earlier years.

   Despite this year's yield-slashing drought,
people should keep in mind that surplus crop production still is a
major problem in U.S. agriculture, says Orville L. Freeman,
president of the Agriculture Council of America.
   ``The drought of 1988, bitter as it is for U.S. farmers, should
not obscure the fact that the chronic long-term problem in
agriculture has been one of overcapacity and that we must continue
to seek and expand markets,'' Freeman said in a council newsletter.
   The ACA is a privately supported organization based in
Washington. Its major interests include U.S. agricultural trade
policy and programs.
   Freeman, who was secretary of agriculture for eight years in the
Kennedy and Johnson administrations, said it is well to remember
that world food shortages in the mid-1960s and mid-1970s were
followed quickly by surplus production.
   ``True, the drought year 1988 is a much greater hardship for
American farmers than those other years,'' he said. ``But while
praying for the return of good weather next year, we must continue
to create customers for our products and work toward a world system
that encourages trade.''

   Once again, the Agriculture Department is
trying to tell us that Jack Frost really doesn't paint the autumn
leaves with vivid colors.
   ``Another story is that Indians kill the celestial bear each
fall and his blood drips from heaven to give the leaves their
hues,'' the USDA says.
   But Stan Krugman of the department's Forest Service says frost
has little to do with the beautiful fall colors, although cooler
weather does enhance them.
   Here's his explanation:
   ``During the summer the tree continually replenishes the
chlorophylls it uses up making food, and the leaves remain green.
As autumn approaches, changes in daylight and temperature slow food
production, and the tree uses up the chlorophylls faster than it
replaces them.
   ``As the chlorophylls decrease, so does the green color,
allowing other pigments that were hidden by the leaves' greenness
to show through.''

<HEAD>Industry Ad Campaign Seeks To Regain Support for Nuclear Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America's troubled atomic power industry has
started spending millions of dollars on advertising aimed at
rebuilding public support for nuclear energy.
   The advertisements make the argument that nuclear power helps
reduce dangerous U.S. dependence on foreign oil imports.
   Anti-nuclear activists, however, say the ads are misleading
because only about 4 percent of U.S. oil consumption goes toward
generating electricity. They contend that the industry is
belittling or ignoring safety risks involved with nuclear power.
   Spearheading the pro-nuclear campaign is the U.S. Council for
Energy Awareness, a Washington-based trade association largely
supported by the nuclear industry. USCEA's advertising and public
relations activities are augmented by other groups, including the
Edison Electric Institute, also based in Washington, representing
the nation's investor-owned utilities.
   Carl Goldstein, a USCEA spokesman, said that about $7 million of
the organization's $17 million annual budget goes to advertising.
   The ad campaign includes a 15-second spot that ran during the
CBS Evening News and Saturday afternoon baseball games on NBC this
summer.
   The cartoon-style ad depicts a person perched atop oil drums as
they speed up and down a roller coaster. Then the person is flung
into midair and floats back to earth using a parachute emblazoned
with the words ``COAL'' and ``NUCLEAR.''
   An announcer intones: ``The problem with foreign oil is that
price and supply go up and down. To get off this roller coaster,
America can use its own coal and nuclear energy. America can count
on coal and nuclear energy.''
   USCEA is striving to convey a similar message _ spelled out in
greater detail _ in advertisements in The Wall Street Journal and
magazines including Time, Newsweek, U.S. News & World Report,
Reader's Digest, National Geographic, Forbes and Sports Illustrated.
   One ad says: ``Even though most Americans believe that nuclear
energy will continue to play an important role in our nation's
energy future, no new nuclear power plants are currently being
planned. At present, too many financial, political, licensing and
regulatory uncertainties stand in the way of America's further
developing its nuclear energy resources.''
   Criticism of USCEA's advertising campaign has come from the Safe
Energy Communication Council, a Washington-based coalition of 13
energy, environmental and public interest groups.
   ``Current national television and magazine advertisements
promoting nuclear power as a solution to foreign oil dependence are
misleading and irresponsible,'' the council said in a statement.
   It contended that ``since nuclear power provides only
electricity, it cannot substantially reduce U.S. dependence on
foreign oil. ... Energy efficiency and conservation provide the
greatest potential for reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil and
helping avert another oil crisis.''
   According to the organization, ``aggressive energy efficiency
programs'' in the transportation, industrial, commercial and
residential sectors can yield seven times the oil savings possible
with nuclear power.
   Scott Denman, the council's director, said that ``when compared
to energy efficiency and conservation, the economic and
environmental costs of nuclear power make it an undesirable
alternative to oil-fired electricity.''
   To counter the USCEA campaign, the council is distributing
public service announcements to radio stations.
   In one, actor Robert Redford tells listeners: ``This year the
nuclear industry is spending millions to sell you on nuclear power
and also saying solar energy is not practical today. Yet every year
more solar energy equipment is being bought by consumers and even
utilities to power a variety of our energy needs. ...
   ``Nuclear energy creates wastes. Conservation creates jobs.
Don't get sold on nuclear power. We can't afford the price,''
Redford says in the radio spot.
   USCEA's Goldstein defended the advertising campaign, saying, ``I
have absolutely no trouble with our ads, and neither have the media
who have carried them.''
   ``The content of these ads is very carefully researched and
tested externally before the ads are prepared,'' he said. ``We can
back up every statement in the ads.''
   Goldstein said USCEA believes that ``nuclear power is an
important component of the drive for energy self-sufficiency.'' At
the same time, he added, ``we do not say that energy efficiency or
other energy sources should be neglected.''
   According to Goldstein, USCEA is trying to alert the American
public to a ``serious looming energy problem'' _ growth of the
demand for electricity outstripping the ability of utilities in
some areas of the country to provide the power.
   Many utilities, he said, are reluctant to invest in nuclear or
coal-burning ``baseload'' generating capacity, but are resorting to
oil or gas-fired combustion turbines as a short-term option for
coping with peaks in electrical demand.
   ``It's happening even more than we had expected because oil
prices have collapsed,'' Goldstein said. ``Utilities are now being
seduced by these low oil prices into thinking they should build
more oil-fired capacity.''

<HEAD>Bentsen Walks Fine Line As He Campaigns For Vice President And
Senate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd
Bentsen waved his hand and his three-helicopter entourage climbed
into the sky, black against the setting sun.
   On the ground, his staff waved back and the national press corps
shuffled away. For that evening, vice presidential candidate
Bentsen had become Texas Sen. Bentsen campaigning for re-election.
   Nearly everywhere he goes in his vice presidential campaign
travels, Bentsen makes time to slip away _ sometimes by helicopter
or private plane _ to tend to his Senate campaign.
   He campaigns publicly for the vice presidency. For the Senate
election, he is relying on a strong organization, millions of
dollars in advertising and a reputation built over three terms.
   Bentsen, asked once by reporters if his dual campaigns weren't
confusing to the voters of Texas, said the answer was simple.
``Vote twice for Bentsen,'' he said.
   Vice presidential campaign manager Joseph O'Neill said this
awkward system is the result of Bentsen's effort to comply fully
with federal election laws which have never been tested in regard
to Texas' unusual provision for dual campaigns.
   ``This is virgin territory,'' O'Neill said.
   ``We're working very hard to see that we follow not only the
letter of the law but the spirit of the law,'' Bentsen said in an
interview.
   ``I leave it up to the lawyers and accountants to be damn sure
we comply,' Bentsen said. ``Then I don't worry about it. I go ahead
and campaign.''
   As Michael Dukakis' running mate, Bentsen receives public
funding for his vice presidential campaign. For his Senate race,
the sky is the limit in fund-raising, and he's spending his
millions in the state on organization and television.
   One of the reasons that Bentsen is carefully dividing the two
campaigns is that Bentsen's Republican Senate opponent, Rep. Beau
Boulter, asked the Federal Election Commission to step in and block
what he contended was an unfair advantage.
   The FEC declined to act, and so did the federal courts, but the
case caused Bentsen enough political grief that he bought
television time in Texas to explain his reasoning to the voters.
   Resigning from the Senate seat, Bentsen said, would
automatically hand a six-year term to his opponent. If he ran, won,
and then resigned, the voters would get to select a new senator in
a special election.
   Boulter has tried to ridicule the dual candidacies with his own
television spot, featuring old-time cowboys trying to ride two
horses at one time. So far, the polls consistently show Bentsen
ahead of Boulter by a 2-to-1 margin, but Republicans say their
effort has helped keep Bentsen pinned down.
   Bentsen has been forced to keep separate his Senate campaign,
and the $8 million it plans to raise _ including putting its Austin
headquarters in a building separate from the Democratic Party and
the presidential campaign.
   ``If Bentsen were not on the ticket, we probably would have had
joint operations,'' said O'Neill. ``We now don't have that
(advantage) ... to avoid even the appearance of overlap.''
   Since his selection as the vice presidential candidate in July,
Bentsen has not made a single public appearance billed as a Senate
candidate.
   Although legally O'Neill said there was no question Bentsen
could do a Senate campaign trip, if he did, ``He would be perceived
as a vice presidential candidate.'' That might give the Republicans
``an excuse to make a charge that had no foundation,'' he said.
   ``We don't expect him to do any Senate campaigning,'' O'Neill
said.
   Bentsen's campaigns guard against at least any overt
cross-pollination, although the division isn't airtight. Bentsen's
top national campaign aides often tag along to Senate events, and
O'Neill, Bentsen's former top aide in the Senate, regularly
consults with the Senate campaign as they set up the schedule.
   The schedule given to the national press coyly puts those Senate
fund-raisers in the category of ``private meetings.''
   Boulter makes no secret about the fact he wants to tie his
campaign as closely as possible to George Bush's, to ride Bush's
coattails and help Bush win Texas.
   Boulter sent out a fund-raising letter saying that, while voters
cannot legally give directly to Bush, they can ``help win Texas for
Bush and Boulter, and defeat Lloyd Bentsen by giving urgently
needed dollars to my campaign for the U.S. Senate.''
   Jack Devore, spokesman for Bentsen's Senate campaign, says
Boulter's actions illustrate the ``very fine point'' being pressed
by the Republicans.

<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush, heading to his first
face-to-face encounter with Democratic presidential opponent
Michael Dukakis, has cleared much of this week's schedule to bone
up for next Sunday's debate.
   Bush is keeping a light campaign itinerary, taking day trips out
of Washington and returning in the afternoons to closet himself
with his debate coaches.
   Bush today was speaking to the Bucks County Chamber of Commerce
in Pennsylvania after a meeting in Philadelphia with Roman Catholic
Archbishop Anthony Bevilaqua and retired Cardinal John Krol.
   On Tuesday he travels to New Jersey to visit the Annin flag
company, a business he has cited in speeches as a sign that
patriotism has been on the rise during the Reagan presidency. Bush
says flag sales were down when Jimmy Carter was president, but that
after Reagan's election, business was booming again.
   Later in the week, Bush plans a brief campaign trip to Texas.
   As he prepares for the Sunday debate at Wake Forest University
in North Carolina, Bush told reporters he is ``not too good on
these statistics'' and needs briefing time to familiarize himself
with statistical information on various topics that likely will
come up.
   Bush and his team have not been hesitant to mention often that
Dukakis is a debating expert and should be expected to perform well.
   Bush said last week that he isn't nervous about going up against
Dukakis, ``but I'd like to do well.''
   ``He's better than I am'' on technical style, Bush said, adding,
``So I've got to do something else.''
   He said he hoped he would be able to project who he is as a
person, in keeping with his recent efforts to show a compassionate
side.
   ``It has to be what you feel and what you are,'' he told
reporters flying with him last week on Air Force Two.
   But Bush reflected a calm demeanor toward the debate, saying,
``I don't view it as make or break, or the end of the world, or the
biggest moment of my life.''

   Across 20 feet of ankle-deep water,
Charlie Land stares at a brown bear sow.
   The bear stares back. She scratches her side, then lunges at
Land. He fills the shrinking gap with a pink cloud of hot-pepper
aerosol, a sort of natural tear gas, and the bear wheels back to
her side of the stream.
   Again she scratches. Finally she ambles off across the tidal
flat.
   Land backsteps up the gravel spit he was defending, then turns
to the three people waiting a dozen steps behind him.
   ``She didn't mean it,'' he says. ``She wasn't serious.''
   Land shrugs off such confrontations as part of his job with the
Alaska Department of Fish and Game, enforcing an uneasy truce
between man and bear at one of the few places where the species
willingly meet.
   Pack Creek flows into a narrow ocean inlet from a steep valley
on Admiralty Island, about 30 miles south of Juneau. The island
boasts the greatest density in the world of Alaska brown bears, a
larger version of the grizzly species.
   Late each summer, about 30 bears congregate at Pack Creek,
splashing through the shallows after spawning salmon and grazing in
the surrounding meadow like a herd of cows.
   The interlopers, game officials say, are the increasing numbers
of wildlife watchers whose eagerness to capture bears on film is
crowding this corner of wilderness.
   Pack Creek is one of only three observatories in Alaska where
people can readily watch brown bears. The two others are so popular
the state has a visitor limit at one and a lottery for permits to
the other.
   Now Pack Creek is being overwhelmed.
   Up to 60 people a day hunker on the gravel spit. Yachts
congregate offshore; bush planes buzz in and out steadily. In 1981,
100 people came to Pack Creek. Last year the visits topped 990.
   Until this year visitors and bears chased each other around the
meadow at Pack Creek, the people in pursuit of photographic
trophies, the bears guarding prime spots on the salmon stream.
   But gradually, the bears have grown bolder, and less intimidated
by humans. They have chased people off the spit and carried away
packs and food. Biologists learned from maulings at Yellowstone and
other parks which once had garbage dumps that bears become most
dangerous when they associate people with food.
   ``We think we have a bomb there and it's ticking,'' says Ken
Mitchell, U.S. Forest Service director for the Admiralty Island
Nationl Monument.
   Mitchell backs a plan, designed by the Forest Service and state
game officials, to designate the spit as human turf and leave the
rest of Pack Creek to the bears. The authorities hope the boundary
will keep people from being mauled and bears from being killed.
   A few bear-watchers are furious.
   ``The bears are all used to people and they're busy fishing.
They don't mind you,'' says John Tillinghast, a Juneau attorney who
visited the creek one recent weekend.
   Tillinghast said it used to be easy to come away from Pack Creek
with a standard prize: ``Mom and cubs with a 50-millimeter lens ..
. and you didn't have any babysitter from Fish and Game watching
you either.''
   The bear that lunged at Land _ called ``Pest'' with reason _
prompted the new rule. In 1987, a Forest Service letter file grew
fat with reports of bold advances by bears along the creek, mostly
Pest:
   _ Three wildlife watchers reported Pest circled them chomping
and growling, then jumped toward them. She was turned away by
hot-pepper spray.
   _ A San Francisco man told the Forest Service he was chased into
the loft of a woodshed. ``The only reason that I did not shoot was
that there was a similar problem yesterday'' and the bear did not
attack, he wrote.
   _ Tourists abandoned a pizza on the spit while fleeing from an
approaching bear. A researcher recorded the bear's reward, down to
the cheese hanging from its snout and paws.
   Forest Service staffers at Pack Creek pleaded with Mitchell to
do something. ``None of us wants to see Pest killed, but we feel
some action must be taken soon to prevent more incidents,'' they
wrote, suggesting the creek be closed to people.
   In July 1987, the Forest Service and Alaska Fish and Game
announced Pest would be killed. When the anticipated roar of
protest came, they began work on the less drastic plan adopted this
year.
   Enter Stan Price, an irascible 88-year-old who loathes
government officials on principal and who has become a rallying
point for others opposed to this particular government plan.
   Price built his cabin and floated it onto the remote banks of
Pack Creek more than 30 years ago. In the decades since, he has
shared the creek with dozens of bears and raised orphan cubs.
   ``It burns me up,'' Price says of the new rules, which he feels
allow game officials to harass the animals. ``I can't say what a
bear's worth. I can't say what a bear's good for. But I know they
were here before we were.''
   He reports little conflict with the bears that wander into his
cabins and woodsheds. Price calls them tame and says he was injured
by a bear only once, when he mistook a strange animal for a
familiar one and was swatted on the shoulder as he approached.
   Price believes the Forest Service and Fish and Game have trumped
up tales of danger so people will believe they need official
protection at Pack Creek. Then in the name of safety the agencies
can charge admission and turn the creek into a money-making
Yellowstone, he says.
   Price knows the bears by name and lineage and becomes distraught
at thoughts they might be shot or relocated.
   State and federal officials have said that if the boundary
system doesn't work they will relocate Pest and, if she returns to
Pack Creek and causes trouble, she'll be killed.
   The Forest Service hopes to exercise some crowd control, too, by
limiting commercial tours, which now account for more than half the
visitors. Officials are considering a fee to cover the government
cost of monitoring Pack Creek, estimated at more than $20,000 a
year. They say there's no intent, as Price suggested, of making a
profit.
   Someday, Mitchell predicts, there'll be need for an observatory
where hundreds of people can go to watch the bears' annual fishing
binge.
   But it won't be at Pack Creek.
   ``If there are such viewing areas,'' Mitchell says, ``they
probably shouldn't be in wilderness.''

<TEXT>
   The ``miracle babies'' who survived in the
rubble of collapsed hospitals after the Mexico City earthquake in
1985 now are 3-year-olds, thriving on special attention from
doctors and relatives.
   Evelia Alvarez Gasca, good-humored and playful, likes to sing
and dance. Her favorite is ``Speedy Gonzalez,'' or was, before she
broke the record and pulled the cartridge out of the turntable arm.
   Sarita Valencia Corona, another of the 19 miracle toddlers,
lives with her grandparents in a community with a view of
snow-capped volcanos. She entertains herself with the chickens,
ducks and cows in the small yard or helps her grandparents tend
their crops.
   Jesus Manuel Figueroa or ``Chuchito,'' possibly the biggest
miracle of all, finally is walking and beginning to talk.
   All the babies except Chuchito were from a few hours to a few
days old when the quake struck at 7:19 a.m. Sept. 19, 1985,
bringing the two hospitals where they were born crashing down.
   Government figures put the death toll at about 6,000 people;
unofficial sources put the toll as high as 32,000. Including the
hospitals, more than 400 buildings in the city of 18 million were
destroyed and 5,700 damaged, the government said.
   Chuchito was 21 days old when the quake hit, in an incubator and
on intravenous liquids because of problems at birth. When the
12-story hospital fell, everyone except his mother gave him up for
dead.
   The 19 babies survived amid the rubble from eight hours to
nearly nine days after the quake. Cold and almost unconscious,
Chuchito was found after a week.
   ``Chuchito was just meant to live. No matter what happened he
was going to live,'' said Edward Sawatzky, a Canadian who was in
Mexico City when the quake hit and has been helping victims ever
since.
   ``These babies were under very severe conditions, without food
for a long period, with hypothermia, hypoglycemia,'' said Dr.
Barbara Hernandez, who cares for 14 of them.
   They had infected wounds and were dehydrated, but only one
suffered lasting injuries, doctors say, a boy who suffered a
deformed hip joint because of infection. The boy, Jesus Francisco,
learned to walk four months ago.
   Hernandez and other doctors say the other babies are normal
except for one who was born without legs from the knees down and
Chuchito, whose slowness in walking and talking they say are due to
his birth problems.
   Evelia will have to have surgery on her tear ducts and needs
orthopedic shoes, her aunt said.
   About half the children, including Evelia and Sarita, lost their
mothers, but all are in what social workers consider to be good
family situations.
   In one sense the babies are lucky. They were from poor families
and have had more medical attention and stimulation than they would
have had otherwise. And they caught the hearts of everyone.
   ``The ones I worry about are the secondary victims'' who aren't
in the limelight, said Janet Rogozinski, head of U.S. Private and
Voluntary Organizations here. The agency channels private donations
from the United States to earthquake victims.
   Among them are the six older sisters of Lucia, another of the
babies. While Lucia is cared for by a doting aunt, her sisters, now
5 to 12 years old, were seriously neglected even though they were
living in the same household.
   With a donation from the United States, they are now living and
going to school in a convent during the week. Donations also are
supposed to help build a home for Lucia's father and sisters on a
lot left by his wife, although neighbors now are claiming the land.
   Also less fortunate are a boy and his four sisters, 3 to 12, who
lost their parents in the quake and are now in an orphanage.
   An American couple was approved as adoptive parents, but sources
familiar with the case say an uncle of the child has blocked the
process. He wants legal custody but does not want the children to
live with him and denies accusations that he is interested only in
a trust fund that benefits the children, the sources said.
   Poverty is a besetting problem for the earthquake babies'
families.
   Sarita's father, who visits often, lives and sells tamales in an
area of Mexico City with no street lighting or other public
services and dirt streets that are barely passable by car even when
dry.
   Evelia's aunt, uncle and father sell used clothing, costume
jewelry and other items in a market to support themselves and their
five children.
   Evelia's uncle, Reynaldo Becerra Aguillon, said sales were down
and he can't raise his own prices to make up for the higher prices
they have to pay for food and other items.
   ``We manage to make enough to cover the expenses,'' he said.
``Not very well, but more or less.''

<HEAD>Arab Vote Could Be Crucial In Israeli Elections</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   How Israeli Arabs vote in the Nov. 1 election
may be crucial in deciding a close vote between Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's Likud bloc and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres'
Labor Party.
   ``The two major parties are running neck and neck. The Arabs
might well decide the election, especially if they desert the Labor
Party,'' said Elihu Katz, a pollster for the Israel Institute of
Applied Social Research.
   About 330,000 Arabs living in Israel are eligible to vote this
year, and they could control 14 or 15 seats in the 120-member
Parliament if all cast ballots.
   In the last elections in 1984, the Arab vote gave Peres' party
about three seats. That turned out to be the margin of advantage
Labor had over Likud, 44 to 41 seats.
   But Israeli pundits and Arab politicians say Labor has lost
ground with the 800,000 Arabs with Israeli citizenship in the
nation of 4.4 million.
   This is largely the result of increased Israeli Arab
identification with the 1.5 million Palestinians who live in the
lands captured from Jordan and Egypt but who do not have the right
to vote.
   Since Dec. 8, 266 Palestinians have been killed, thousands
wounded and about 18,000 jailed as a result of the uprising against
20 years of Israeli occupation.
   ``I believe that the Labor Party is going to loose 50 percent of
its traditional (Arab) voters this year because of the situation in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip,'' said Abdel Wahab Droushe. ``Labor
leaders speak about peace, and they do the opposite.''
   Droushe deserted the Labor Party in April to form his own
Democratic Arab Party. He said he was unable to serve in the same
party with Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who ordered the army to
use bullets, clubs and mass arrests to stop the protests.
   Labor also was embarrassed by the collapse of its peace
strategy, which had relied on Jordan's King Hussein to find
moderate Palestinians acceptable to Israel and form a joint
negotiating team. Hussein cut most links with the West Bank and
Gaza and made clear he was no longer willing to go along with such
a plan.
   Emanuel Gutmann, a political science professor at Hebrew
University, said losing the Arab vote could be the difference in a
tight race with Likud. Labor and Likud were forced to share power
after each failed to form a ruling coalition on its own after the
1984 elections.
   ``The reason there was a government of national unity was
because there was parity between the left and right. It is unlikely
there will be a repeat of this parity if Labor loses two or three
seats because of the Arabs,'' Gutmann told an election seminar.
   The battle for the Arab vote is seen in ads carried by
Arabic-language newspapers.
   ``This election is going to decide the future of all of us ...
either peace or war,'' states a Labor Party ad in the weekly Al
Sinara in Nazareth.
   Despite its hardline policies and opposition to yielding any
occupied land, Likud advertized in the Nazareth weekly Kol Al Arab
stressing its ``honesty'' and ability to lead.
   Likud politicians have argued that the conservatives made peace
with Egypt and are the only bloc that can speak for all of Israel
in peace talks.
   In the last elections, about 70 percent of the 260,000 eligible
Arabs voted and about half of those casting ballots chose Israeli
parties. Labor garnered 65,000 votes to 10,000 for Likud.
   Getting a feel for how Arabs will vote is difficult because
Israeli pollsters do not survey Palesinians, in part because
Israeli opinion takers are viewed with suspicion in Arab areas.
   The only organized opinion sampling is by the Bustani
Advertising Co., and its findings tended to support those of
Israeli analysts such as Gutmann and Katz who said the Arabs would
shun Israeli parties for more radical Arab ones.
   Awad Abu Sini, 52, who owns an appliance store in Nazareth, said
he told Peres during a visit last month that the Labor Party was in
trouble and ``we hope to hear something new.''
   Abu Sini said he would like to see a pledge from Labor leaders
to ease harsh army measures in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``The West Bank is only a half-hour away. We have ties of
religion, language and family. We are the same people with the same
feelings and future. If they use such force there, maybe they will
use it here,'' he said.
   But Abu Sini said despite such feelings he would still vote for
Labor because it offered the best hope for peace negotiations.

<HEAD>November Ballot Measures Focus On Pocketbook Issues</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Pocketbook issues will dominate as voters around the nation
decide more than 200 ballot issues in November. Three states in the
West may cut taxes, four others may turn to lotteries to raise
revenue, and California may vote to slash auto insurance rates.
   Three states may declare English their official language, and
three will consider anti-abortion measures.
   Among the more interesting local issues: Nevada City, Calif.,
will weigh a ban on steel-jaw leg traps; voters in Fort Collins,
Colo., will consider a homosexual rights amendment; Oregonians will
vote on a measure that would impose the nation's toughest statewide
smoking ban, and Bostonians may choose to create a city within its
borders named Mandela, comprising mostly black neighborhoods. A
similar effort to honor the imprisoned South African black leader
Nelson Mandela was defeated in 1986.
   By far the costliest and hardest-fought battle will center on a
jumble of five conflicting referendums that could require
California auto insurers to cut their rates to at least 20 percent
below November 1987 levels and freeze rates until November 1989.
   Insurance companies are backing two propositions establishing a
no-fault policy for car accidents and limiting lawyers' contingency
fees.
   Money matters are also uppermost in Arkansas, Colorado, South
Dakota and Utah.
   A proposed ``Colorado Taxpayer Bill of Rights'' amendment would
require voter approval to raise state or local taxes and would
restrict property and other taxes and limit increases in state
spending. But the signatures that put the measure on the ballot
face a challenge this month that could knock it off.
   South Dakota Proposition II would limit property taxes to 1
percent of 1984 values for agricultural property and 2{ percent for
nonagricultural. Supporters contend that property taxes have gotten
out of hand, and they believe the state should introduce other
forms of taxation. Opponents contend the measure would imperil
school districts.
   In Utah, three initiatives could roll back state and local taxes
by a combined $320 million. One would cut sales, gasoline and
cigarette taxes. Another would limit property taxes. A third would
provide an estimated $3.5 million in tax credits for parents who
send their children to private schools.
   In Arkansas, the secretary of state is to decide in the next
several weeks whether to place a constitutional amendment on the
ballot making it harder to raise sales taxes and easier to raise
the income tax. Gov. Bill Clinton is a leading supporter.
   Abortion opponents will take their case to voters in Michigan,
Arkansas and Colorado. Arkansas' secretary of state will rule
shortly on whether to certify a proposed constitutional amendment
to ban the use of state funds for abortions except to save a
mother's life. Voters narrowly defeated a similar measure two years
ago.
   In Michigan, anti-abortion groups and pro-choice advocates both
plan heavily financed campaigns over whether to end state Medicaid
funding of abortions. Early polls show anti-abortion forces leading
by a 2-1 margin.
   Colorado voters will decide whether to repeal a section of the
state constitution prohibiting use of state funds for abortion.
   Colorado, Arizona and Florida have ``English only'' amendments
aimed at declaring English the official state language. It is
unclear what such amendments would accomplish, but opponents,
especially Hispanics, call the measures bigoted and vindictive.
   Among other key ballot contests:
   _In Massachusetts, voters will consider a measure that could
effectively end production of nuclear power in that state. Gov.
Michael Dukakis opposes it, and utilities insist they would sue to
block what they say would amount to an illegal taking of their
property.
   _Voters in Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky and Minnesota will decide
whether to clear the way for lotteries despite opposition from
religious groups and others.
   Minnesota would use gambling proceeds to protect the state's
natural resources if voters approve a proposed environmental
resources trust.
   In South Dakota, a proposed amendment would allow limited
gambling in Deadwood, the Black Hills town where Wild Bill Hickok
was shot while playing poker.
   _Californians will weigh Proposition 102, which would impose
tough guidelines for screening and controlling the spread of AIDS,
including ending the state's ban on AIDS testing for insurance and
employment. The measure is the latest by Paul Gann, co-author of
tax-cutting Proposition 13 and himself suffering from acquired
immune deficiency syndrome.
   _The Oregon Lung Association is campaigning for what would be
the nation's toughest statewide smoking ban, prohibiting tobacco
use in virtually all public buildings and work areas except
taverns, tobacco stores, hotel rooms and offices in private homes.
   State law already bans smoking in most public buildings except
in designated areas.
   _An initiative in Washington state would impose a tax on
hazardous materials such as petroleum and pesticides to provide for
their safe disposal. A rival issue backed by the Legislature and
business would exempt petroleum products shipped out of state and
offer covenants not to sue polluters if they take steps to clean up
hazardous waste sites.
   _Montana residents will consider whether to become the 10th
state to enact a bottle return bill.
   _In Maryland, a ballot measure would repeal that state's stiff
gun control law.
   _A proposed amendment in Rhode Island would effectively deny
bail to those who manufacture or possess illegal drugs.

<TEXT>
   Two northern California fires burned at least 15 homes Sunday
and forced evacuation of at least 200 people, while in Yellowstone
National Park less snow fell than expected but frosty temperatures
kept flames down.
   A storm over west-central Montana produced enough snow and rain
that fire crews were allowed to begin returning home. Idaho got
little precipitation and crews faced some new fires.
   The 8,700-acre brush fire near Vacaville, southwest of
Sacramento, led to the evacuation of 65 people from 12 homes and
burned at least nine homes, in addition to two outbuildings, said
California Department of Forestry spokeswoman Dianne Sanders.
   The fire apparently was set by an arsonist, Department of
Forestry investigator Loyde Johnson said, but he would not
elaborate.
   Winds, which earlier in the day had gusted up to 35 mph,
decreased later in the day, making firefighters hopeful they would
be able to gain the upper hand by nightfall.
   ``It's looking better because of the change in the wind down to
about 12 miles per hour, so we're able to get in there finally with
bulldozers and hand crews,'' said John Ferreira, another forestry
spokesman, late Sunday afternoon. ``It's laid down quite a bit
now.''
   The wind-swept flames also threatened about 50 other homes in
the area about 55 miles northeast of San Francisco, forest
department spokesman John Ferreria said.
   Vacaville Fire Chief Howard Wood said several radio towers were
damaged by the fire on top of Mount Vaca. Two people suffered
burns, he said.
   North of Vacaville, six homes were destroyed as about 7,000
acres burned Sunday east of Redding and 40 to 50 families were
evacuated from the small communities of Whitmore and Oak Run,
California forestry spokeswoman Lisa Chiesa said.
   An additional 85 people were evacuated from a private school
called the Cascade School, said spokeswoman Evelyn Dollarhide.
Twelve outbuildings were destroyed, including a barn containing
several classic cars, officials said.
   Fighting the fire was difficult because of dry timber and wind
gusting up to 45 mph, Chiesa said.
   Up to 6 inches of snow had been forecast for Yellowstone, in
northwestern Wyoming, but most of the park got only a dusting.
   However, by midday the temperature was still only 37 degrees,
limiting fire activity and allowing crews to jump on hot spots
before they had a chance to get out of hand, said fire information
officer Judy Jennings.
   The park has been besieged for nearly three months by dry
weather and fires that have charred more than half its 2.2 million
acres.
   Jennings said crews on many fires would hold off on building
containment lines.
   ``There's really no need for it right now. Fire activity is low
in most locations throughout the park,'' she said.
   And in any event, fire managers have said the terrain and access
around parts of the 335,300-acre North Fork blaze make building
containment lines there extremely difficult. Natural barriers
surrounding the fire were expected to help keep it in line.
   In west-central Montana, firefighting crews and the soldiers who
reinforced them began pulling out of the 247,000-acre Canyon Creek
fire Sunday while a storm continued to drop snow and rain.
Officials said the force would be replaced by 20-member
rapid-response teams in each of the three national forests that the
fire affected: Lolo, Lewis and Clark and Helena.
   Some firefighters also were being released Sunday from the
35,400-acre Red Bench fire in and near Glacier National Park, said
fire information officer Jim Payne. He said hotspots and the
potential for renewed trouble remained.
   Glacier officials said snow and rain had reduced fire danger
enough to allow reopening of backcountry trails and campgrounds,
but with some restrictions.
   A weather front that moved over Idaho on Saturday brought
disappointingly light precipitation, and firefighters had two new
fires that started Friday and Saturday, one caused by lightning,
said Nez Perce National Forest spokeswoman Mary Zabinski.
   But high humidity and temperatures in the 40s helped
firefighters in their effort to keep most Idaho wildfires within
the boundaries of the Frank Church-River of No Return, Gospel Hump
and Selway-Bitterroot wilderness areas.

<DATELINE>KOENIGSTEIN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a scene repeated throughout
the country, ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe are crowding into
the village of Koenigstein in hopes of starting a new life in the
West.
   Nearly 500 recently arrived ethnic Germans are staying in
Koenigstein. They are just a small part of a record wave of 200,000
expected to arrive in West Germany this year.
   Most of them come from the Soviet Union and Poland, with smaller
numbers from Romania and other East European countries.
   ``Sure, there are problems and difficulties,'' says Koenigstein
Mayor Antonius Weber. ``Our resources are overtaxed. But the people
are there, and we have to do what we can,'' he said in an interview.
   In Koenigstein, 483 ethnic Germans were crowded into two
temporary housing facilities last week in this town of 16,500
nestled in the scenic Taunus Hills near Frankfurt.
   ``We simply can't refuse,'' says Weber of the new arrivals.
   Private initiatives are being started. The ZDF television
network has announced it is setting up, in conjunction with a
nationwide charity organization, a program to find private
individuals willing to help the newcomers with the numerous
problems they face.
   ``The incorporation of several hundred thousand ethnic Germans
from Eastern Europe is one of the biggest challenges of the next
few years,'' ZDF officials said in announcing the program.
   Officially, the federal government welcomes the arrivals as
German citizens and praises the Soviet bloc's increased willingness
to permit their emigration centuries after their forebearers
settled in parts of Eastern Europe.
   But with Red Cross estimates saying the number will climb to
600,000 by the turn of the century, many towns and cities are
having trouble coping with the results of Bonn's open-door policy.
   After arriving at various transit camps such as Friedland near
the East German border, the ethnic Germans are gradually sent to
other parts of West Germany _ straining social services already
kept busy with tens of thousands of asylum-seekers from Third World
countries.
   Eventually, the ethnic Germans are given help to find their own
housing and a job.
   Their difficulty understanding the German language has been a
major problem, especially since the children are required by law to
attend school almost immediately after their arrival.
   ``Many of my colleagues tell me that in many towns and cities
throughout the country, the ethnic German chldren need extra
attention in the classroom because of language problems,'' says
Gerhard Fischer, a 36-year-old high school teacher in Offenbach.
   Heinrich Franke, the federal government official in charge of
overseeing the nation's work force, was even more blunt about
language problems.
   ``The language barrier is the largest stumbling block to getting
a job for the ethnic Germans,'' Franke told reporters.
   Franke noted that the government this year will spend 600
million marks ($450 million) for language instruction, much of it
for the ethnic Germans. He said that is double the amount called
for in the federal budget.
   The Soviet Union alone has granted exit visas to more than
15,700 ethnic Germans this year, and nationwide the results of the
influx from Eastern Europe have been far-reaching and dramatic. The
federal government has been hammering out a comprehensive package
to aid their intergration into German society.
   West German federal officials say this year's expected wave of
200,000 ethnic Germans is more than double last year's 86,000
people.
   The southern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg has announced a plan to
build 10,000 apartments for up to 40,000 ethnic Germans this year
and next year.
   ``It just can't be the case that we welcome these ethnic Germans
_ but make them live shabbily for years in gymnasiums, tent cites,
containers and even on boats,'' state Interior Minister Dietmar
Schlee told a news conference in Stuttgart.
   In fact, officials say that integration is the key word if the
country of 61.3 million people is to successfully absorb the influx.
   ``We can't have `ethnic German cities,''' says federal building
Minister Oscar Schneider. ``They should live throughout the country
_ and must not be isolated.''
   Schneider called for a speedy progress on a program that already
has an allocation of $600 million from the federal government for
new homes and apartments for the ethnic Germans.
   With the birthrate falling among West Germans, there has been
some speculation that the government welcomes the ethnic Germans as
a means to halt the slide.
   Der Spiegel magazine quoted Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
often-repeated phrase that ``our rich land'' can open its arms to
Germans from Eastern Europe.
   ``Plus they're hard-working people who are ready to bring a
bunch of kids into the world,'' Der Spiegel commented in a major
report on the newcomers in August.

   Here, at a glance, is a look at Burma, where military commander
Saw Maung overthrew civilian President Maung Maung:
   THE LAND _ Burma, on the Bay of Bengal, is nearly the size of
Texas and shares frontiers with Bangladesh, India, China, Thailand
and Laos. Resources include fertile soil, teak and other hardwoods,
oil and several important minerals. Rangoon, with a population of
3.5 million, is the capital and largest city. Mandalay, the
second-largest city and last capital of the Burmese kings, is of
historical and cultural interest. Burma has a tropical monsoon
climate.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ About two-thirds of the 38 million people are
ethnic Burmans, who are related to Tibetans. Important minorities
include Karens, Shans, Chins, Kachins, Chinese and Indian. About 85
percent of the people practice Buddhism, with minorities adhering
to Islam and Christianity.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ Per capita income is about $180 a year, making
Burma one of the world's poorest nations. An agricultural country,
Burma once was the world's leading rice exporter but it experienced
food shortages in 1987. Burma's debt has climbed to more than $3
billion.
   The black market, fueled by smuggled goods from Thailand and
China, overshadows the official economy.
   Burma's economic failure is generally attributed to poor
government management and a crippling war against several ethnic
minorities seeking autonomy. Japan and West Germany are major aid
donors, and the United States has a modest assistance program,
mainly in the anti-drug area.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ The Burmese arrived from Tibet before the 9th century,
displacing earlier cultures. Burma's golden age was the 12th
century, when its kings built the spectacular temples of Pagan.
Britain ruled it from 1886 to 1948. After a post-independence
experiment with democracy, a military coup in 1962 brought Gen. Ne
Win to power. He imposed isolationism and socialized the economy.
   Ne Win resigned July 23 after anti-government demonstrations. He
was replaced by retired Army Gen. Sein Lwin, who resigned Aug. 13
after further anti-government riots. Maung Maung, a
Western-educated lawyer, on Aug. 19 became Burma's first civilian
president since the 1962 coup. Saw Maung, defense minister since
July, ousted Maung Maung in a military coup Sunday.
   Burma seeks to maintain a strictly neutralist policy and keep
out most foreign influences, including joint ventures with foreign
companies. It has been nicknamed ``Asia's hermit.'' Tourists are
allowed to stay only one week.

   Facts and figures on Haiti:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ Haiti covers 10,700 square miles on the western third
of Hispaniola, a Caribbean island about the size of Maryland shared
with the Dominican Republic. Most of Haiti's land is mountainous
but eroded and treeless, allowing little more than subsistence
farming.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   
   THE PEOPLE _ Ninety-five percent of Haiti's 6 million people are
descendants of African slaves brought to the New World to cut sugar
cane. A slave revolt led by Francois Dominique Toussaint
L'Ouverture led to independence from France on Jan. 1, 1804, making
Haiti the first black republic in history. French is the official
language, although the majority of Haitians speak Creole.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   
   THE ECONOMY _ Haiti is the Western Hemisphere's poorest country.
Life expectancy is 54 years, per capita annual income is $379 and
85 percent of the people live in poverty. Only 13 percent have
access to uncontaminated drinking water. Thousands, including about
15,000 abandoned or orphaned children, live and sleep in the
streets of the capital, Port-au-Prince, without shelter, sanitary
facilities or other necessities. A privileged class of about 60,000
controls nearly half the national wealth. Every five minutes a
Haitian child dies of malnutrition.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   
   HISTORY _ Haiti controlled all of Hispaniola from 1818 to 1839.
U.S. troops occupied the country from 1915 to 1934 after a long
period of instability. A post-World War II boom brought foreign
investment, tourism and public works, but little was done to help
the poor. Continuing political turmoil ended in 1957 with the
election of Francois Duvalier, a doctor who declared himself
president-for-life in 1964. ``Papa Doc'' died in 1971 and was
succeeded by his 19-year-old son, Jean-Claude. The Duvalier family
amassed an immense fortune and created the notorious Tonton
Macoutes, a private militia that throttled political opposition by
arresting, torturing and killing dissidents.
   Jean-Claude fled in February 1986 after food riots grew into
nationwide protests, and a military junta led by Duvalier's army
chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, took power. Namphy ruled
until civilian President Leslie Manigat, winner of
government-controlled elections, took office on Feb. 7, 1988.
Namphy overthrew Manigat in a bloodless military coup on June 17.
Namphy was ousted on Saturday. On Sunday, the commander of the
Presidential Guard, Brig. Gen. Prosper Avril, a former Duvalier
adviser, declared himself president.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Here is the full text of Brig. Gen.
Prosper Avril's proclamation that he has taken over as president.
The statement, read on national television, was translated from
French by The Associated Press:
   Liberty, equality, fraternity. Proclamation, people of Haiti:
Today, Sept. 17, 1988, the Presidential Guard have just made a big
decision.
   Sickened, the non-commissioned officers and soldiers of this
elite corps say, by the way the country has been governed since
Feb. 7, 1988, and after the blow struck on the night of June 19-20,
they have been forced to act again; this time to bring to power
Brig. Gen. Prosper Avril, whom they themselves have decided to
place in the highest public office with the rank of Lieutenant
General.
   Before the gravity of the situation, to save the country from
anarchy and chaos, I find myself forced to accept the office of
president of the military government.
   In this conjuncture, difficult and dangerous for the future of
the nation, the Armed Forces of Haiti have been called upon to
demonstrate discipline and altruism to save this country, which we
all love profoundly.
   We ask the population to stay calm and to go about its business
as usual. To friendly powers and international institutions, to
which the Republic of Haiti is bound by treaties and agreements, I
give formal assurance that all of Haiti's commitments will be
respected.
   We dream of a Haiti where liberty will flourish, where human
rights will be guaranteed and dialogue will be honored for the sake
of national reconciliation, and where the economic stagnation in
which the country is floundering will disappear for the greatest
good of the greatest number.

<TEXT>
   Four people were injured and at least a dozen were
detained when gang violence erupted at a Central American
Independence Day Festival on Sunday, police said.
   More than 100 police officers in riot gear were called into
Tropical Park to break up widespread fights and close down the
festival, where an estimated 30,000 people gathered to hear an
assortment of Hispanic bands.
   ``We had bottles thrown, broken heads, a lot of arrests were
made,'' said Metro-Dade police spokesman Al Hidalgo-Gato. ``It was
due to the extensive amount of gang members present at Tropical
Park.''
   One man with a gunshot wound in his chest and another who was
shot in the buttocks were admitted to Baptist Hospital of Miami,
said emergency room nurse Jose Segarre.
   The hospital also treated a police officer and a concertgoer who
were hit in the head with bottles and two women who suffered heat
exhaustion, Segarre said. All were in stable condition Sunday
evening.
   ``Fights were happening throughout the park,'' said Lori
Alterman, an assistant promotion director at WPOW-FM, which
sponsored one of the stages on which musicians performed.
   ``There was pushing and shoving, but whenever you put thousands
of people in a small area it's going to happen,'' she said.
   ``All the stages and vendors were told to close down,'' she
added. ``Police handled it excellently, without any major riots.''
   Traffic was tied up for hours on the nearby Palmetto Expressway
as thousands of people unaware of the early end to the concert
tried to enter the park.

<TEXT>
   Congress is heading into the final weeks of
its 1988 session talking optimistically but showing no overt action
on its biggest piece of unfinished environmental business:
rewriting the Clean Air Act.
   ``It's possible to get a good bill this year,'' says Rep. John
Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee,
where closed-door negotiations on an anti-pollution package have
been moving slowly.
   In the Senate, George Mitchell, D-Maine, is ``more optimistic
than he's ever been'' about getting floor time for a comprehensive
bill that received Environment Committee approval more than a year
ago, says press secretary Diane Dewhirst.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and Senate Majority Leader
Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., have clean air legislation on their short
lists for possible floor debate as Congress heads for adjournment
by mid-October.
   Wright has not been a major player in drafting a blueprint to
combat smog and other urban pollution into the next century and
impose stiffer controls on acid-rain pollution and airborne
emissions of toxic chemicals.
   Byrd, however, is the principal factor in the Senate impasse,
largely because of his interest in protecting his state's coal
industry, which could lose business under a variety of acid-rain
control scenarios.
   The lame-duck majority leader has said little publicly about the
situation. On Friday, through press secretary Tina Evans, he said:
``There's a lot of pressure to deal with clean air legislation this
year. ... This is a very difficult and controversial issue and
whether common ground can be found remains to be seen.''
   Earlier Friday, Wright was asked what Byrd had told him about
the legislation's future in the Senate this year. ``He's hopeful he
can steer it to a successful conclusion in the Senate,'' Wright
replied.
   Sources on both sides of the Capitol say Byrd's major concerns
are gaining more time for coal-burning power plants and factories
to clean up their emissions and providing some sort of economic
cushion for mine workers hurt by any move away from coal caused by
acid rain controls.
   Even the Environmental Protection Agency is stepping up its
involvement as adjournment nears. EPA Administrator Lee Thomas, who
favors new efforts against urban pollution but opposes acid rain
provisions, is now telling lawmakers they should consider new
provisions to control airborne pollutants.
   From the lobbying sidelines, the environmentalist Clean Air
Coalition and its rival, the industry-backed Clean Air Working
Group, both say they want a bill this year, but they are far apart
on its contents.
   Coalition chairman Richard Ayres says his side wants the
strongest bill it can get and won't hesitate to pull the plug on
its push for a bill this year if the House and Senate develop
``proposals too weak to clean up the air in this century.''
   The industry group opposes acid rain controls as premature and
not supported by scientific consensus. Its administrator, William
Fay, says the group supports ``a prompt and sensible solution'' to
urban pollution from carbon monoxide and smog-producing ozone.
   At last count by EPA, about 100 cities and metropolitan areas
were not complying with limits on these pollutants. Congress' most
likely remedy would be to give them more time to clean up but
require tougher steps.
   Dingell and other Energy and Commerce negotiators haven't even
addressed the acid rain question.
   They are still hung up on the urban-pollution issue of whether
vehicle-makers should have to produce less-polluting cars, trucks
and buses _ a subject close to the hearts of Dingell and auto
industry constituents.
   Environmentalists blame Dingell and his allies for the
slow-moving negotiations. Industry lobbyists point the finger at
Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., the chairman of the Energy and
Commerce health and the environment subcommittee, an advocate of
tough tailpipe emissions standards.
   For their parts, Dingell and Waxman are throwing no rocks, at
least in public. Sources close to the bargaining say the overall
strategy is to mark time until it appears the Senate will produce a
bill before risking any unnecessary showdowns and bloodletting on
the House side.
   One thing the entire process cannot stand with time running out
in 1988 is a contentious, lengthy House-Senate conference to
resolve what likely would be major differences in legislation
produced by each chamber.
   Mitchell and Dingell have discussed ways of avoiding a rerun of
1986 when they and others spent tortuous, fractious months
resolving House and Senate bills to beef up the ``Superfund''
hazardous waste cleanup program.
   The two lawmakers reportedly have reached at least tentative
agreement on steps to avoid a drawn-out conference over clean air.
   Under the arrangement, Senate provisions on acid rain would form
the starting point for conferees, who would begin their
negotiations over urban pollution provisions with what emerges from
the House.

<HEAD>U.S. Considering Philippine Proposal To Help With Debt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials are considering a new proposal
by Philippine Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus aimed at resolving
military bases negotiations and helping the Philippines with its
$28 billion debt.
   The proposal, according to Philippine sources, would include
about $460 million in U.S. aid and another $100 million that would
be used to buy U.S. Treasury bonds in a complex ``debt swap.''
   Congressional sources have said U.S. negotiators in Manila
offered a package totalling $489 million for fiscal 1989, but it
was turned down by the Philippine panel which reportedly has been
demanding more than $1 billion a year.
   Manglapus said the new proposals do not represent a scaled-down
demand because the two sides always have been fairly close on the
amount of money the United States actually would have to
appropriate. And another Philippine official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the plan would result in long-term
interest savings that could make the total benefit close to the $1
billion the Philippines wants, without costing the United States so
much.
   Manglapus, who heads the Philippine negotiating team, told a
Filipino-American group Saturday night that he was pleased with
response to his proposal from members of Congress and Treasury
Department officials. He said agreement could come soon after he
returns to Manila early next month.
   The U.S.-Philippine talks are over terms of the final two years
of the agreement that allows the United States access to its two
largest foreign bases, Clark Air Base and Subic Navy Base, along
with smaller Philippine facilities. Separate negotiations before
1991 would have to decide the long-term future of the bases.
   ``I would have to say that I am much more positive,'' Manglapus
said after a week of meetings in Washington.
   The Washington Post reported on Saturday that the administration
was considering a new Philippine proposal but said State Department
officials were not convinced it was practical or affordable. Both
Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Defense Secretary Frank C.
Carlucci have said the United States will consider pulling its
bases out of the Philippines if the demands are too high.
   Rep. Stephen J. Solarz, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs subcommittee on Asia, said Manglapus' proposal was ``worthy
of the most serious and sympathetic consideration,'' the Post
reported.
   Philippine officials, who asked not to be identified by name,
outlined some details of the new proposal after Manglapus referred
to it in his speech.
   One official said it would include the issuing of U.S.-backed
bonds that would be used to buy off some of the Philippine debt at
the market rate, which is about 50 cents on the dollar. The plan
has some similarities with that used to help ailing Mexico and
Brazil.
   The other requested aid would include $160 million in economic
assistance, $200 in military aid and more than $100 million in
other programs, including food aid, the official said.
   Current U.S. aid tied to the bases is $180 million a year,
although total American aid approved by Congress has averaged more
than $440 million annually since President Corazon Aquino ousted
Ferdinand Marcos in 1986.
   The Philippines considers at least part of the money ``rent''
for the bases, but U.S. officials call it aid and say it is only
indirectly tied to the bases.
   Manglapus, answering questions at the Filipino-American
gathering, said Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's proposal for
closing the Soviet base in Vietnam in exchange for a U.S. pullout
from the Philippines should be discussed between the superpowers.

   A former governor, the wife of another, and sons of a former
senator and a former governor are on the ballots as 12 states hold
elections for their top office in November.
   In three of those states _ Utah, West Virginia and Indiana _
Democrats are favored to retake the governor's mansion from
Republicans; in a fourth _ North Carolina _ a Democrat is giving
the GOP incumbent a hard time.
   Currently, 27 Democratics and 23 Republicans serve as governors.
Nine incumbents _ six Republicans and three Democrats _ will be on
the ballot. Republican Robert Orr of Indiana is barred by law from
a third term; Montana Democrat Ted Schwinden and New Hampshire
Republican John Sununu are retiring.
   If Massachussetts' Michael Dukakis is elected president, Lt.
Gov. Evelyn Murphy, also a Democrat, will serve out his term, which
expires in 1990. In Nevada, Lt. Gov. Bob Miller will complete the
two years remaining in fellow Democrat Dick Bryan's term if Bryan
is elected to the U.S. Senate.
   Other states electing governors this fall are Delaware,
Missouri, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.
   In Missouri, Democratic state Rep. Betty Hearnes, wife of former
Gov. Warren Hearnes, who served in 1965-73, lags behind Republican
Gov. John Ashcroft in fund raising and in polls. Ashcroft is
seeking his second term.
   Democrat Thomas Judge, Montana's governor from 1972-80, is
seeking a comeback against former state Sen. Stan Stephens in a
race seen as a tossup.
   New Hampshire's lineup was determined Tuesday when Rep. Judd
Gregg, whose father, Hugh, was governor in 1953-55, ran away with a
three-way GOP primary. He faces lawyer Paul McEachern, who nearly
beat Sununu two years ago.
   And in Indiana, Secretary of State Evan Bayh, 32-year-old son of
former Sen. Birch E. Bayh, hopes to capitalize on his famous name
in a race against Republican Lt. Gov. John M. Mutz.
   Republican Gov. Norm Bangerter's bid for a second term is in
danger in Utah, where a weak economy, a record $166 million tax
increase, several bank failures and the drought have eroded his
popularity.
   Polls this month by the Deseret News and KSL-TV and by The Salt
Lake Tribune had Democrat Ted Wilson, former mayor of Salt Lake
City, ahead by 13 and 23 points respectively.
   In West Virginia, Republican Gov. Arch Moore is in trouble
against Democrat Gaston Caperton, a political novice who spent more
than $2 million, most of it his own, to win a seven-way primary.
   A poll this month by The Associated Press, Charleston Daily Mail
and WSAZ-TV gave Caperton a 60-31 percent lead.
   Moore, seeking an unprecedented fourth term, said the poll gave
him ``one heck of a heartburn,'' but called the results ``an
aberration'' that would shift before the election.
   West Virginia has one of the nation's highest unemployment rates
and had to borrow $80 million this year to keep running.
   Bayh is leading in his bid to break the GOP's 20-year grip on
Indiana's governor's office. His father lost in 1980 to Dan Quayle,
now the Republican vice presidential candidate.
   An Indianapolis Star poll in late August gave Bayh 45 percent
support and Mutz 39 percent, with 16 percent undecided.
   Gov. Jim Martin and Democratic Lt. Gov. Bob Jordan are locked in
a spirited race in North Carolina. An early August survey by the
Greensboro News & Record found Martin with 46 percent support and
Jordan 42 percent, with 12 percent undecided.
   Martin stirred controversy this month with a commercial on
black-oriented radio stations questioning Jordan's commitment to
the state Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.
   The ad, featuring a fictitious conversation in a black
barbershop called Smitty's, points out that Jordan declined to
serve on a Martin-appointed commission to plan observances. It does
not mention that Martin opposed the 1987 vote to establish the
holiday or that Jordan favored it.
   Jordan called the ad ``sleaze.''
   Vermont's first woman governor, Democrat Madeleine Kunin, is
favored to win a third term against state Rep. Michael Bernhardt.
   Bernhardt has sought to capitalize on opposition to Vermont's
``growth bill,'' a measure to control development. The law brought
out the independent, anti-government streak in hunters, trappers,
farmers and others.
   Here's a brief look at races in other states:
   DELAWARE _ A mid-August poll by the Wilmington News-Journal gave
Republican Gov. Michael N. Castle a 56-point lead over Jacob
Kreshtool, a whimsical 69-year-old lawyer and environmentalist who
began the campaign with a three-week trip to Alaska.
   NORTH DAKOTA _ Democrat George Sinner is expected to win a
second term despite depressed oil and commodity prices and his
support of new taxes. His challenger, businessman Leon Mallberg,
has never run for statewide office.
   RHODE ISLAND _ Communications executive Bruce G. Sundlun won
last week's Democratic primary for the right to face Gov. Edward D.
DiPrete as he did in 1986.
   WASHINGTON _ Democrat Booth Gardner is heavily favored for a
second term. King County Prosecutor Norm Maleng, in his first try
for statewide office, is expected to win the Sept. 20 GOP primary.

<HEAD>Black Leaders Hope To Give Dukakis Edge With New Voters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black political leaders say Michael Dukakis
failed to energize blacks but hope drives to register and mobilize
voters beginning late this month will help produce the winning
difference for the Democratic ticket.
   ``He may not have the charisma of Jesse Jackson, or the charisma
of a John Kennedy,'' said Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga. ``But black voters
can sense the difference between Dukakis and Bush, between a
Republican and a Democrat. I think we're ready to go out and
mobilize our people.''
   Blacks voters in areas like Lewis' home state of Georgia,
California, and throughout the industrial North can provide the
winning margin for Dukakis in November, said several members of the
Congressional Black Caucus, interviewed at their annual legislative
conference over the weekend.
   Dukakis met privately in Washington last week with several
members of the caucus and endorsed their plans for a
double-barreled effort to energize black voters beginning Sept. 29.
   The plan's organizer, District of Columbia House delegate Walter
Fauntroy, said members of the black caucus and leaders of black
organizations will travel to 14 targeted states to register voters,
then re-visit those states and 42 cities beginning Oct. 14 to
encourage blacks to get to the polls. Fauntroy said the states
targeted are places where a heavy black turnout can overcome as
much as a 60 percent to 70 percent GOP advantage among white voters.
   ``I am confident that (the enthusiasm) will be back as we launch
this drive,'' Fauntroy said.
   Several black lawmakers said the energy generated during the
party's national convention in July in Atlanta, which stemmed from
an effort to give defeated presidential candidate Jesse Jackson a
greater role in the campaign, had been largely squandered over the
past two months.
   ``There was not as close a working relationship'' between the
Dukakis and Jackson camps as there should have been, said Rep.
Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. ``As late as it has been in coming, things
are picking up,'' Rangel said, but added: ``It hasn't trickled down
yet'' to rank-and-file black voters.
   Rep. George Crockett, D-Mich., said Dukakis appears to be afraid
that courting blacks too visibly will antagonize the ``Reagan
Democrats,'' white blue-collar voters, he has been trying to woo
back into the Democratic column.
   ``I don't see any evidence of going all out to get the black
vote,'' Crockett said.
   Dukakis sought to generate renewed energy in a speech Saturday
to the gathering of black leaders, calling the election ``a
struggle for the soul of America'' with particularly high stakes
for blacks.
   ``It's a struggle we must win, and I need your help to do it,''
the candidate said. ``I need your ideas. I need your energy. I need
your active involvement at every level of the campaign. Because our
adversaries are not just George Bush and Dan Quayle. Our
adversaries are despair and resignation and indifference and
complacency.''
   Dukakis acknowledged it will take ``the largest voter turnout in
American history'' for Democrats to win in November.
   And he acknowledged, in a poke at his own relatively dry
speaking style, that he has been unable to excite blacks in the way
Jackson does. ``I've been working with him to sharpen his message,
improve his delivery, and develop more charisma,'' he said of
Jackson.``And he's getting better.''
   According to several participants, Dukakis' support is due as
much to antipathy for the Reagan administration as to the
Democrat's positive message.
   ``There's a growing feeling on the part of black America that
Bush will be a copy of Mr. Reagan,'' said Lewis. ``There is almost
a hostile feeling on the part of blacks against this
administration, and Bush has been a part of that.''
   Added Rep. Major Owens, D-N.Y.: ``Regardless of what mistakes
are made by Dukakis, we decided we have to go ahead and repudiate
the Reagan administration. We have to deliver for this ticket.
We're putting our differences aside. We'll argue after we win.''

<HEAD>Possible Teamsters Strike Underscores Shift In Hollywood Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At issue was the Hollywood balance of power,
and the Teamsters chief didn't mince words. Negotiations with
producers yielded ``the worst contract offer ever made to a union
in the history of our great and prosperous business.''
   The letter Earl Bush sent Wednesday to his 2,200 studio drivers
echoed a familiar refrain. For the second time this year, a
Hollywood labor leader was telling his membership that television
and movie producers were picking a fight, forcing a strike.
   As scriptwriters did in March, Teamsters are expected to do
later this month _ walk off the job. Though the unions represent
vastly different talents, their disputes share a common theme:
determining the split of the entertainment industry's spoils.
   While big-name studios, producers, actors and agents consolidate
clout and record income, a variety of entertainment industry
workers _ such as writers, plasterers and screen extras, who just
lost their pension plan _ are being asked to make do with less,
union leaders say.
   ``We don't have any demands,'' said Bush, secretary-treasurer of
Teamsters Local 399. ``We're trying to stop the take-aways. They're
taking care of themselves awfully well. And they're talking about
our demands being high.''
   There's no question that some Hollywood power brokers and power
hitters are pocketing monumental paychecks. Last year, Disney head
Michael Eisner took home at least $26 million in salary, stock
options and bonuses. Actor Bruce Willis collected more than $5
million for several weeks' work on ``Die Hard.'' And the annual
incomes of any number of Hollywood hotshots easily exceed many
lottery jackpots.
   But producers still complain about rising costs, tougher
competition and dwindling television advertising revenues. The days
of double-digit growth, they say, are gone.
   ``The urgent need to curb below-the-line (behind-the-camera)
costs associated with filming motion pictures and television shows
in Los Angeles ... has reached crisis proportions,'' said J.
Nicholas Counter III, president of the 217-member Alliance of
Motion Picture and Television Producers.
   Producers bent on trimming costs are taking their shows to
non-union stages, states and countries _ thereby reducing
transportation, as well as other production fees, by as much as
half. To stem what it calls ``forced-away'' productions, the
producers alliance is asking the Teamsters to take pay cuts up to
$2 an hour and rewrite overtime rules.
   ``The networks have come to us and said we've got to hold those
costs down, that they can't absorb them any longer,'' Counter said.
``There are Teamster rates in other parts of the country that are
$3-$4 an hour less than what we have under our current contract.
... We can take on another major strike ... to change these
contracts around.''
   Hollywood featherbedding is almost as old as Hollywood itself.
Hair dressers charge $350 for a day's work, even if they're curling
and teasing for a few hours. One union insists that different floor
sweeping crews be used for when sets are built and when they're
torn down. And Teamsters do, occasionally, earn $16.61 an hour for
playing cards and eating doughnuts between dispatches.
   But, Bush asserted: ``Are the (producers) going to tell Arnold
Schwarzenegger that he has to take a 15 percent pay reduction? Or
are they going to tell Sylvester Stallone, `You won't get $15
million anymore?'''
   So why, he asked, do they tell a driver who does physical labor
``that he has to take a pay cut to bring business back to town?''
   ``They're trying to take the littlest working force in the
industry and they're going to cut them just to show everybody. ...
We'll work with the producers. But they've gotta cut theirs also.''
   Said veteran director Richard Brooks: ``One of the reasons costs
are higher is that the studios themselves perpetuate this whole
thing. They say, `We're going to give this actor $8 million to play
this picture.' And the guy driving the truck, or my camera
assistant, or the makeup man, says, `Eight million bucks! What ...
are they talking about? We work six or seven days a week.''
   Whatever the case, the producers hold the cards, and it's not a
weak hand. The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage
Employees, Hollywood's biggest union with more than 24,000
behind-the-camera members, already has pledged that it will not
strike when its contract expires in January.
   Although it says its no-strike stance is a matter of contractual
obligation, some observers wonder if the union isn't simply fearful
of coming up short in a long and damaging strike.
   Hollywood labor pacts typically mirror previous contract
negotiations with other studio unions. The problem with such
``pattern bargaining,'' Hollywood unionists say, is that the
contracts negotiated by a weak guild will be used as a model in
subsequent negotiations, creating a domino effect.
   Because of this, there is concern among industry labor leaders
that the outcome of the Teamsters dispute will have a direct effect
on negotiations with the mammoth Screen Actors Guild, whose
contract expires next year.
   Brian Walton, executive director of the Writers Guild of America
West, suffered through this year's five-month strike against the
producers.
   ``They pick on unions because they believe that they can,''
Walton said. ``The writers' strike was totally avoidable. ... It's
not unreasonable to say the strike cost the producers somewhere
between $150 million and $200 million. And they stand to save maybe
$2 million (on the final contract terms).
   ``I think that the evidence of the '80s in Hollywood
demonstrates a conscious, long-range agenda to render guilds and
unions increasingly irrelevant. They don't want them to be players
in the economic picture,'' Walton said.
   Counter dismisses any such motivation. ``It's an issue of
competitiveness,'' he said, noting California's loss of production
to other states, Canada and Mexico. ``We have to remain
competitive.''

<HEAD>World Bank Says Growth In World Trade Enables U.S. To Ease Deficit</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON (AP) The World Bank says the United States has
managed to increase its exports and ease its trade deficit without
hurting the exports of other nations.
   The report released Sunday said the U.S. has benefited from a
``much-improved competitive position,'' with the value of the
dollar having dropped more than 50 percent against the West German
mark and the Japanese yen over the past two years.
   Yet, the report said, the U.S. successes in reducing its trade
deficit by increasing exports ``are not being offset by decreases
in exports elsewhere.'' Instead, exports of other nations are
apparently being helped.
   ``Exports from the United States grew during 1987 and early 1988
at over 20 percent a year ... while current estimates show that
world trade increased at about 11 percent from the first to the
second half of 1987,'' the report said.
   The bank also said that wealthy countries have enjoyed a stable
year of moderate growth in output and low inflation, but the growth
rate slowed in developing countries, partly because of continued
problems in sub-Saharan Africa and drought in India, the bank said.
   ``Output growth and inflation in the seven largest industrial
countries _ Canada, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy,
Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States _ each averaged about
3 percent in 1987,'' the report said.
   But the economies of sub-Saharan Africa and other heavily
indebted countries, mainly in Latin America, on average grew more
slowly than population, resulting in a decline in per-capita income
for those nations, it said.
   Among other highlights in the report:
   _Japan is making a ``major contribution'' to stimulating other
economies.
   _Inflation still could return to the major industrial countries
and should be monitored carefully.
   _Third World debt increased again in 1987, but some progress has
been made in finding ways to reduce the burden.
   _Trade protectionism remains a cause for concern.
   The Japanese contribution has been an investment boom, which
began in 1986 and continued into 1988, the report said. The major
beneficiaries of the increase in Japanese imports have been the
newly industrialized economies of Asia, such as South Korea and
Taiwan, it said.
   The imports into those countries, in turn, also have been rising
rapidly, it added.
   The major drought in India was the primary factor behind the
slowing of economic growth in South Asia to 2.7 percent in 1987
from 4.7 percent the year before, it said.
   ``Nevertheless, growth trends of many developing countries in
East Asia, as well as in the region of Europe, the Middle East and
North Africa, were relatively well sustained,'' the report said.

   Peace activists, celebrities and former
``prisoners of conscience'' told a crowd of 200 people in front of
the Liberty Bell they need to fight for human rights.
   Actress Margot Kidder was among those at Sunday's rally to sign
a petition in support of the United Nation's Universal Declaration
of Human Rights. The rally was in conjunction with tonight's
Amnesty International concert.
   ``We give concerts, we speak out, and we never, never remain
silent,'' Miss Kidder said.
   Alicia Partnoy, imprisoned by the Argentina military junta in
1976 for her activities as a student, also attended the rally.
   ``The military's purpose was to silence me and to silence my
friends,'' said Ms. Partnoy, author of ``The Little School,'' the
nickname for the torture center where she was held near her
hometown of Bahia Blanca.
   ``They succeeded in silencing many of my friends, but if I have
the opportunity to relate what happened, then I will never feel
defeated,'' said Ms. Partnoy, who works as a translator in
Washington, D.C.
   Tonight's six-hour concert, which features Bruce Springsteen,
Sting, Peter Gabriel and Tracy Chapman, is part of a six-week
worldwide concert tour by Amnesty International to mark the 40th
anniversary of the human rights declaration.
   Celebrities expected to attend include Meryl Streep, Billy Dee
Williams and Robin Williams.
   Concerts are also scheduled for Los Angeles and San Francisco.
   Amnesty International, based in London, monitors human rights
abuses, particularly the plight of political prisoners. The
organization won the 1977 Nobel Peace Prize.

<HEAD>Collector Closes The Book On His Quest For The Zamorano 80</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 35 years, Henry Clifford finally
has his Zamorano 80, and it's not parked in his garage or orbiting
Saturn, but sitting in a Los Angeles bank vault.
   His Zamorano 80 is one of just two complete collections of 80
rare books declared by the Los Angeles-based Zamorano Club of
bibliophiles in 1945 as works best representing early California
history.
   For more than four decades, the collection of first editions has
had cult following among book collectors. A complete Zamorano 80 is
estimated to be worth between $750,000 and $1 million.
   The book club and the collection were named after Agustin Juan
Vicente Zamorano, who in the 19th century was California's first
printer.
   The books include such well-known titles as Mark Twain's
``Roughing It'' and Bret Harte's ``The Luck of Roaring Camp,'' and
more obscure works such as Robert Louis Stevenson's essays in ``The
Silverado Squatters.''
   Clifford, 78, a retired investment counselor, completed his
collection this year when he bought the last two books for $42,000.
   The only other complete collection is at Yale University. The
University of California, Berkeley has about 70 volumes, and
Huntington Library in San Marino has 79.
   The crown jewel of the collection _ No. 80 missing from the
Huntington collection _ is a 90-page work called ``The Life and
Adventures of Joaquin Murieta, the Celebrated California Bandit,''
by John Rollin Ridge, son of a Cherokee chief.
   Only three or possibly four first editions are believed to
exist. Clifford bought his more than 10 years ago from a private
party in Maine. It was a book-buying coup and ensured that it would
only be a matter of time before he could complete his collection.
   Clifford plans to display his collection next year in San
Francisco, New York or Santa Barbara, and says that in the
meantime, ``anyone who wants to see it can contact me.''
   Anyone, that is, except the Huntington Library.
   ``The Huntington has been hounding me for my collection, but I
won't give it to them,'' said Clifford, a member of the library's
Society of Fellows, which helps support the institution. ``If
things go to a library, they're buried with rare exception.''

   A sniper killed a suspected Mafia
member as he strolled in a prison yard, police reported. The victim
was to have appeared before a judge to answer questions about a mob
war in the region.
   Pasquale Rocco Libri, 26, died after receiving a single shot in
the face on Sunday, police said. The sniper apparently was hiding
in a partially constructed building near the prison, police said,
and escaped in a car.
   Libri was in jail on charges of attempted homicide and
membership in the 'ndrangheta, a local version of the Mafia,
according to authorities. His father and uncle reportedly head a
'ndrangheta clan.
   The victim, his father and uncle were indicted recently on
charges of Mafia membership at the conclusion of an investigation
into the 3-year-old war between organized crime gangs in Calabria,
the tip of the Italian ``boot.''
   Libri was scheduled to appear before a judge in December to
answer questions about the organized crime war.

<TEXT>
   Although modern Americans know Chicago as
``the windy city'' for bellowing politicians and brisk Lake
Michigan breezes, early Native Americans knew the community as
``the place of the bad smell.''
   And 17th century Indians gave President Reagan's birthplace of
Tampico a name with a special meaning. It translates as ``the place
where there are dogs.''
   Thousands of cities, counties, rivers and parks were given names
with special meanings by the ancient North American Indians and
John Tenney, Jr., has begun a campaign to recognize the
long-forgotten names.
   For six years, Tenney has worked at his home in Williamson,
N.Y., digging through history books, reading Indian folklore and
contacting hundreds of postmasters and historians to compile a list
of 5,000 Native American names, their meanings and origins.
   ``So many beautiful and interesting Native American names have
been disguised and Anglosized to the point you can't recognize them
anymore,'' Tenney said. ``I think it's sad because most of them are
very descriptive and conjure up real images, unlike more modern
names.''
   Tenney's public awareness campaign has led him to write articles
about the Native American names found in every state. The articles
contain specific names of cities, rivers and lakes of states that
Tenney has individually researched.
   If Tenney can't find a buyer for his article, the 55-year-old
corporate engineer simply donates the work to a state publication
willing to print it.
   Such was the case recently in Illinois, where Tenney offered a
piece to the state Department of Conservation's Outdoor Highlights
magazine.
   ``We received a letter, unsolicited, offering us a story on
names of cities and places in Illinois from this guy in New York,''
said Gary Thomas, editor of the state-produced wildlife magazine in
Springfield.
   ``We told him we were interested and he provided a list of about
20 pages of names. He told us to choose which ones we'd be
interested in and he produced a story. We told him we couldn't pay
him anything and he said it was no problem.''
   The story revealed the history behind dozens of names like
Chicago, which Tenney said means ``place of the bad smell'' or
``garlic field'' and came from the Algonquin Indians.
   According to Tenney's research, ``Illinois'' means ``man'' and
was used by the Illinois Indians to describe themselves.
   Tenney even traced the roots of tiny Tampico and found it was
named after the Mexican city and means ``place where there are
dogs'' in Mayan.
   ``How many Anglo or European names are so descriptive?'' Tenney
asked. ``These are great names and I just think something ought to
be done to get these names into widespread use and understanding.''
   Tenney's fascination began about six years ago, when he was
hiking on Mount Marcy in the Adirondack Forest of upstate New York.
   ``The Indian name for Mount Marcy was a word that means `Cloud
Splitter.' That's what they called the highest mountain in New
York. That's a great name. It's much better name than some old
governor's name,'' said Tenny, whose research has taken him to a
half-dozen Indian reservations and led him to Native American
languages long forgotten.
   ``It's been a fascinating experience. If you like history and
the outdoors, you get an enormous feeling for American history and
Indian history from reading about these names,'' he said.

<HEAD>Study Finds Nearly Half of Juveniles Arrested Are on Drugs or
Alcohol</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government study of juveniles in youth
correctional facilities gives a grim picture of the home lives of
those youngsters who commit crimes before adulthood.
   The study found that nearly three out of four of the juveniles
come from broken homes and were under the influence of drugs or
alcohol when they committed their offense.
   The study by the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice
Statistics also found that nearly 60 percent of the 18,226
juveniles in the long-term, state-operated institutions during 1987
had used drugs regularly, once a week or more for at least a month.
   Seventy-two percent of the boys and girls under 18 said they had
not grown up with both parents. About half of all the juveniles

<HEAD>Poll Finds Concern over World Population Growth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new poll says 60 percent of Americans favor
financial assistance for family planning programs in developing
nations, regardless of whether abortion is legal in those countries.
   The poll by Louis Harris and Associates, which was done for the
Population Crisis Committee and the Planned Parenthood Federation
of America found 34 percent of those surveyed were opposed to such
aid.
   The Agency for International Development has recently halted
support from countries where abortion is part of family planning
programs. It has also halted funding to both the International
Planned Parenthood Federation and the United Nation's Population
Fund, contending that their policies promoted coercive abortion.
   The two independent population groups paid for the poll of 1,250
Americans in order to gauge the support for family planning in this
presidential election year. A poll of that size has a margin of
error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

   Sen. William Proxmire says that an agency that
spent $68,160 so workers could learn about mass transit at Disney
World is the winner of his latest Golden Fleece award.
   ``This is an idea Dopey would have loved, but it's likely to
make taxpayers feel like Grumpy,'' Proxmire, D-Wis., said in a
statement.
   Proxmire cited the Urban Mass Transit Administration, which
picked up the tab for the $110 per night hotel rooms and $795
program fees for transit officials to attend a four-day seminar on
how to motivate workers.
   Attending the Sept. 6-9 session in Orlando, Fla., were six top
UMTA officials _ including its chief, Alfred A. DelliBovi _ and 47
local mass transit officials from around the country. The officials
paid their own travel expenses.
   UMTA spokesman James Bynum on Friday called the trip ``a
perfectly legitimate effort to convince public transit authorities
that there are ways to attract new riders.''

   A small quake rattled western Nevada,
but there were no reports of injuries or damage, according to the
U.S. Geological Survey.
   The temblor measured 4.6 on the Richter scale and struck at 7:57
p.m. Sunday, said spokeswoman Pat Jorgenson. Its epicenter was 105
miles southeast of Reno.
   The quake was felt as far away as Carson City and South Lake
Tahoe, Jorgenson said. A minor aftershock was recorded at 8:20
p.m., but the agency did not record a magnitude.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   A magnitude 3.5 quake can cause slight damage in the local area,
4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage.

<HEAD>West's Worst Fire Season In 30 Years Is Far From Over</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto GROX1</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The long-awaited autumn weather and snow is helping cool a
record fire season in the northern Rockies, but officials say the
worst is yet to come in hotter areas such as California.
   Wildfires have burned over 4.1 million acres of forest and brush
this summer in the West and Alaska, the worst fire season in 30
years, according to the Boise Interagency Fire Center, which
coordinates the firefighting.
   If hot, dry weather persists in California and southern Oregon,
where the peak fire season is just starting, more than 5 million
acres may burn this year, a survey of firefighting officials shows.
   California has ``critical drought conditions over most of the
state,'' says Karen Terrill, a spokeswoman for the California
Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
   Conditions rival those of last year, when about 800,000 acres of
California timber and brush burned in the state's worst fire season
since the 1920s, she said.
   A fire near Sacramento last week burned more than 52 square
miles, destroying 97 homes and forcing thousands to evacuate.
Firefighters said that fire was nearly contained by Wednesday, but
two other blazes in northern California this weekend burned 15
homes and forced hundreds of people to evacuate.
   Nine homes burned to the ground 15 miles west of Vacaville,
southwest of Sacramento, and six were destroyed 20 miles east of
Redding, officials said.
   ``The worst is still to come,'' Terrill said before the
onslaught of those two fires.
   California's fire season starts as early as April but usually
peaks in September or October.
   This year, ``it could go well into November,'' Terrill warned.
   In the northern Rockies, the autumn chill has taken some fury
out of the area's worst recorded fire season in history. Fires have
charred nearly 1.5 million acres in Yellowstone National Park and
adjacent national forests in Montana, Wyoming and Idaho.
   Up to 6 inches of snow fell last week in parts of Yellowstone
and rain averaged about a quarter-inch in the park. Forecasters
expected the same amount of snow this weekend but most of the park
got only a dusting. But temperatures remained low, limiting fire
activity, officials said.
   ``That doesn't put fires out, but it makes them stay put in one
place until we can get a line around them,'' said Lynn Young, of
the federal Regional Incident Coordination Organization in
Missoula, Mont.
   The force fighting Yellowstone's fires has dropped to 6,700 from
a peak of about 9,500 firefighters and support workers earlier this
month, Young said.
   ``I would say that, perhaps, with luck, we are past the peak in
the Yellowstone area. But we've still got a ways to go,'' said
Arnold Hartigan, a spokesman at the Boise center.
   Twenty-one fires covering nearly 2 million acres still burn in
six states, Hartigan said. Some of the Yellowstone firefighters
have been diverted to a 257,000-acre blaze in west-central Montana.
   ``We're expecting to make progress on the major fires, but they
are very large, and we're going to be dealing with them for some
time to come,'' Hartigan said.
   Here is a breakdown of states hit hardest by fire this year:
   _Alaska: Nearly 2.2 million acres of sparsely populated land
burned, in the state's worst fire season since 1977, the Bureau of
Land Management said. Cool August weather curtailed those fires.
   _Wyoming: Five major fires still out of control have charred
more than 1.2 million acres, Hartigan said.
   _Montana: The forest fire season usually slows down by now, but
five major fires remain uncontained. More than 606,000 acres has
burned, much of it in forests just north of Yellowstone, Young said.
   _Idaho: Six major fires covering nearly 200,000 acres remain
uncontained, Hartigan said.
   _California: Six major fires have burned nearly 63,000 acres and
the peak fire season is just warming up, officials said.
   _Washington: One major fire has burned more than 53,000 acres in
and around the Wenatchee National Forest.
   _Oregon: One major fire has burned about 5,000 acres of the
Willamette National Forest.
   Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada and Utah have had some
wildfires but have been spared the worst of this year's fire
season, officials said.
   The acreage burned might have been greater but for the efforts
of more than 30,000 firefighters and support workers, Hartigan said.
   About 69,000 fires have been reported this year across the West,
a 45 percent increase over last year, he said.

   Troops under orders to halt all public
gatherings on Monday fired into crowds of defiant students,
Buddhist monks and other largely unarmed protesters in downtown
Rangoon. Witnesses said casualties were heavy.
   ``Many students are being mowed down. Can't anything be done?''
a reporter telephoning from the scene said before breaking down in
tears.
   The troops were deployed after a military coup staged Sunday by
hardline armed forces commander Gen. Saw Maung. Not long after the
coup's announcement, angry demonstrators began moving into the city
from outlying areas.
   Battles between the two sides were reported Monday around the
main government administrative building, the U.S. Embassy, Sule
Pagoda, at a junction leading into the city and other areas.
   Residents of buildings near the U.S. Embassy said demonstrators
were being cut down by military fire while others saw two monks
falling to the ground after being hit by bullets around the Sule
Pagoda.
   Total casualties could not be estimated. The shooting was
reported continuing with local residents dragging the wounded
inside their houses.
   A Western diplomat contacted by telephone from Tokyo said
soldiers were firing from rooftops at demonstrators in front of the
U.S. Embassy, but the embassy building itself had not been hit. One
dead person and three wounded could be seen in front of the
building, located on a major commercial street.
   ``There's a lot of shooting. There's been deaths and injured.
It's a bad situation here,'' the diplomat said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Although most demonstrators faced troops without weapons, some
carried swords, spears, crossbows and other primitive weapons.
There were reports that firebombs were being hurled by protesters
in some areas, and demonstrators were seen taking weapons from
fallen soldiers.
   In once instance, troops guarding a road junction opened fire on
a crowd of demonstrators trying to march into the city from the
working class suburb of North Okkalapa.
   According to incomplete reports, the fighting erupted Sunday
night not long after Saw Maung seized power, and more than 40
demonstrators and 17 soldiers were reported killed Sunday night in
one area of the city.
   Sporadic shooting and several large blasts were heard in the
capital after the new authorities imposed an 8 p.m. curfew and
banned public gatherings.
   Thousands of people immediately surged into the streets after
the state-run radio announced the coup. They called for weapons and
began erecting barricades from trees and waterpipes against
military vehicles.
   Saw Maung, 59, said over state-run Radio Rangoon on Sunday that
he overthrew civilian president Maung Maung to halt economic and
social chaos and to hold democratic elections after 26 years of
authoritarian rule by the Burma Socialist Program Party, the sole
legal party. He immediately abolished key government institutions.
   The fate of Maung Maung was not known.
   The sudden announcement came amid speculation the government and
key opposition leaders were paving the way to an interim government
and a return to full democracy.
   ``I believe the people will rise up again and this time they are
going to be angrier. It's going to be tragic,'' Burma expert Josef
Silverstein of Rutgers University said by telephone.
   Troops moved in Sunday night and sealed the offices of all six
government newspapers, making it unlikely they would be permitted
to reopen Monday. Although nominally under government control, the
newspapers have in recent weeks been publishing news about the mass
anti-government movement in the country.
   Protests since July have forced the resignation of two Burmese
leaders and more recent strikes, demonstrations, looting and
lawlessness have pushed the nation to the verge of anarchy.
   Saw Maung, who identified himself as chairman of the Peace
Restoration Committee, has been defense minister since July. He is
widely regarded as a hard-line officer and a right-hand man of the
toppled President Sein Lwin.
   Sein Lwin, whom demonstrators called the ``most hated man in
Burma,'' resigned Aug. 12 after a week of bloody clashes between
troops and unarmed protesters left 112 dead by the government's
count.
   A later broadcast named the other 18 military officers in the
committee, including the army, navy and air force commanders, eight
of Burma's nine regional army commanders, and the unpopular
military intelligence chief, Col. Khin Nyunt.
   The broadcast said all government and state bodies were
dissolved, including local administrations. Striking government
workers were told to return to work by Sept. 26 or face dismissal.
   The initial broadcast, preceded by martial music, said the
military took over state authority ``to curb further deterioration
of the general situation in the country.''
   It said the military would ``restore law and order, peace and
tranquillity in the country ... and ease the daily livelihood of
the people.''
   ``After accomplishing the above objectives, (the authorities
will) hold general elections under a multiparty system. ...
Political parties which accept and practice true democracy can
prepare for the general elections from now on.''
   It said the election supervision commission formed by Maung
Maung's government would be retained.
   Maung Maung, a Western-educated lawyer, on Aug. 19 became the
nation's first civilian leader since the 1962 military coup that
installed the Burma Socialist Program Party.
   Maung Maung bowed to protests and offered general elections
under a multiparty system, but demonstrators say they do not trust
the party and demanded formation of an interim government to
conduct the polling. The government gave no indication it would
agree.
   Burma's last multiparty elections, in February 1960, swept
former Prime Minister Nu to power over an army-backed party. Ne
Win, the armed forces commander then, led the 1962 coup that
toppled Nu's government.
   After years of little resistance to authoritarian rule, students
rioted in September 1987 to protest the government's decision to
void much of the currency in circulation without compensation.
   Security forces killed scores of demonstrators in quelling
broader student-led protests in March and June. Ne Win resigned
July 23, taking indirect responsibility for the rioting.
   Protesters blame the ruling party's rigid socialism for turning
resource-rich Burma into one of the poorest countries in Asia.

   Benjamin held a number of positions during 29 years at the

   He died Sunday at his home in Scarborough after a long illness.
   In 1982, Benjamin was called on to lead the internal CBS inquiry
into the controversial ``CBS Reports'' documentary, ``The Uncounted
Enemy: A Vietnam Deception.'' The CBS program led to a libel suit,
settled out of court, in which Gen. William C. Westmoreland
disputed charges that he ordered subordinates to lower their
estimates of enemy troop strength in Vietnam.
   Benjamin recently wrote a book, ``Fair Play,'' about the episode.
   From 1978 to 1981, Benjamin served as vice president, director
of news, and supervised the development of ``CBS Sunday Morning.''
   He was the executive producer of the ``CBS Evening News with
Walter Cronkite'' from 1975 to 1978. CBS said that during his years

   Sometimes, love reins, especially
when a couple in their finest Western duds exchanges marriage vows
while sitting atop their horses in ``Bonanza'' country.
   Carol Clifford, 47, and B.D. Lapham, 46, said they decided to
tie the knot on horseback Saturday evening in this town near Ben
Cartwright's Ponderosa ranch on the old ``Bonanza'' TV series
because of their love of horses.
   With more than 150 guests watching from hay bales, the couple
said their ``I do's'' in front of a hitching post. But before they
could kiss, the crowd's clapping spooked the horses, causing them
to gallop up a hill. The couple later walked back in with the
horses.
   They originally planned to have a small wedding. ``But then I
said `Let's get married on the horses' and friends started asking
if they could come to the ceremony,'' Lapham said.
   Like their ceremony, their invitations were unusual. They were
designed like an old wanted poster and a friend shot bullets
through all of them.
   They met earlier this year when Clifford, a Reno newspaper
classified ad supervisor, was out walking. She met Lapham outside
the Cowboys & Indians saloon he manages, putting out his flags.
   She stopped and said, ``Oh, you have nice flags,'' and the
romance blossomed from there.

   A get-together with snakes and reptiles, aimed at
dispelling fears about the creatures, met with less than successful
results.
   ``Slimy'' and ``icky'' were the prevailing exclamations after
many of the young visitors touched them.
   They were among 2,000 participants in the sixth annual
Herpetological Weekend, sponsored by the Chicago Herpetological
Society, at the Chicago Academy of Sciences.
   The event gave visitors a chance to pet, prod and probe snakes
like Pythagoras, a 15-foot Burmese python, and about 100 other
serpents, lizards, iguanas and turtles.
   ``That thing feels gross,'' said 7-year-old Alex Vassilopolous,

   ``It kind of feels like this grass,'' said 7-year-old Timothy

tent. He said he wanted to take a snake like Pythagoras home.
   Some herpetologists cited several reasons people might want to
keep reptiles as pets.
   ``They have no body odor. They smell like the room they're in,''
said Tom Anton. ``It's what makes them such effective predators.''
   But, he added, don't expect ``Fido the snake'' to be waiting for

   Both share prices and the dollar inched up during
Tokyo trading Monday.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 60.71-point
winner last Friday, finished trading at 27,901.00, up 34.62 points
or 0.12 percent.
   The dollar closed at 133.80 yen, up 0.04 yen from last week's
close of 133.76 yen. The currency fluctuated between 133.75 yen and
134.10 yen after opening the day at 134.00 yen.
   ``The rate was not moving at all,'' said a foreign exchange
dealer with Mitsubishi Bank.
   He added that only a few individuals were participating in the
market. ``Investors are sort of waiting on the sidelines after a
series of market-affecting news and they don't expect the dollar to
rise further,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   On the stock market, ``trading was pretty active for a Monday,
led by steels and shipbuildings issues,'' said an analyst with
Nomura Securities, Japan's largest brokerage.
   Strong share prices in Tokyo reflected higher closing rates in
overseas markets last week, the analyst added, speaking on
condition of anonymity.

   An idyllic patch of this New Jersey
borough provides a glimpse of what American suburbia could have
been.
   Homes are arrayed in ``superblocks,'' where residents share
parks, quiet cul-de-sacs and a sense of community. Children often
play unattended, far from busy roads.
   Radburn, a planned community started before the Depression, has
gained worldwide renown but few imitators.
   Just 10 miles from the George Washington Bridge to New York
City, Radburn stands as an anomaly among suburban tracts. The
149-acre community has 500 single-family homes, 48 townhouses, 32
duplexes and a 93-unit apartment complex _ one-tenth the size of
the community planned by architects Clarence Stein and Henry Wright
in the late 1920s.
   It was to herald a new stage in development that relegated cars
to peripheral streets and maintained serenity and social contact in
residential life.
   But the developer, City Housing Corp., went bankrupt during the
Depression and stopped building homes in Radburn in 1936.
   What remains is a comfortable novelty for 2,800 residents and an
enticing model of residential life for professional planners. They
say Radburn has inspired some imitations in India, England, France
and in a few U.S. communities, including Reston, Va. In 1974, the
site was included in the National Register of Historic Places.
   ``It certainly stands out as an oasis within the typical
tract-house suburbia that surrounds it,'' said James W. Hughes,
chairman of the department of urban planning and policy development
at Rutgers University. ``It sort of reverses the traditional
pattern of suburban houses fronting on the streets.''
   Hughes said architects Stein and Wright were involved with the
``Garden City'' movement, which sought to counteract the congestion
in urban areas in northern New Jersey and New York early this
century.
   ``In terms of the history of planning, it's extremely
significant,'' Hughes said. ``Essentially, it was the first town
that was attempted to be built for the motor age, supposedly to
tame the automobile.''
   Radburn _ the name means Saddle River in Old English after the
nearby river of that name _ was innovative in its approach to
residential block design.
   The creators abandoned the traditional gridiron street pattern
in favor of the ``superblock,'' a large block of land surrounded by
main roads. The houses, mostly Colonial and English Tudor style,
are grouped around cul-de-sacs, served by narrow access roads
coming from main roads. The land inside the area consists of parks.
Living and sleeping sections in the houses face the park and garden
areas. Service rooms such as the kitchen face the access road.
   ``It envisioned a planned decentralization in American
society,'' said Robert Fishman, who describes Radburn as a model
community in his book, ``Bourgeois Utopias: The Rise and Fall of
Suburbia.''
   ``The Radburn community was to be the center of a whole region
based on a decentralization of housing and also of industry,''
Fishman said. ``It would return America to a community-based life
that is absent today.''
   The community is financed by its residents, who pay a charge
based on their property's assessed valuation. Residents also pay
the full borough tax rate. Radburn fees, which go to an
administrative body called the Radburn Association, pay for the
maintenance of property and recreation programs.
   The association manages a park network of 23 acres, two swimming
pools, four tennis courts, four baseball fields and three
playground areas.
   An elementary school and a non-denominational church are located
on the borders of the property. Most Radburn children can reach the
school without crossing a road.
   Ernest Morris, a Radburn resident for 36 years, pays $3,000
annually in borough taxes and $700 to the association, which he
considers a bargain for a place that he has always considered
special.
   ``It's become an ideal community for senior citizens in that
everything is within walking distance,'' he said.
   The community comprises mainly senior citizens and young
professionals. A big reason: price. The Radburn homes that once
sold for about $6,000 average more than $200,000 when they are
available, said Ron Gatti, manager of the association.
   Planners say that Radburn could not be re-created today except
in very expensive developments. But they say the trend toward
clustered housing and condominium developments in the Northeast has
begun to replicate some of the communal Radburn residents feel.

   People using picks or their bare hands
dug through rubble where their homes had stood, and the search wore
on for the bodies of people who died when a river overran its banks
and swept away four buses.
   As of Sunday, rescue workers had found the bodies of 90 of the
nearly 200 people believed killed the previous day when a flash
flood spawned by Hurricane Gilbert caused the normally dry Santa
Catarina River to overflow.
   The torrent ripped a 40-mile path of destruction through
northern Mexico's most populated region, on which Gilbert had
dumped about 12 inches of rain in 24 hours after leaving the Gulf
of Mexico.
   Gilbert, which killed at least 194 people during its week of
life, was today a tropical depression that was spreading showers
and thunderstorms from Texas to Illinois.
   In Mexico, 31 died when the storm slammed into Mexico's Yucatan
peninsula Wednesday with winds of up to 200 mph. One woman drowned
in floodwaters Sunday in the coastal state of Tamaulipas.
   The storm killed 30 people in Haiti, 26 in Jamaica, five in the
Dominican Republic and eight in Honduras in its deadly rampage
through the Caribbean. Two people were killed in Texas by tornados
spawned by the storm and a pilot died in Oklahoma when his plane
broke apart in heavy rains.
   President Miguel de la Madrid, surveying the destruction in this
northern industrial city on Sunday, said Mexico has ``a lot to
lament.''
   Parts of two major thoroughfares and hundreds of homes built by
the poor in the dry Santa Catarina riverbed were swept away by the
raging waters.
   Although homes had been evacuated hours before the destruction
hit, most residents lost their life's possessions. Officials said
about 30,000 in the region were homeless.
   Many residents used picks or bare hands to dig through the
rubble that remained where their tiny concrete and tin houses had
stood.
   Rescue workers continued to search for bodies, and Jose
Natividad Gonzalez Paras, Nuevo Leon state secretary, said a
``considerable number'' of people still were missing.
   Journalists saw soldiers uncover the body of one man caught in
the mangled remains of an electricity tower.
   The man, who appeared about 20 years old, had been covered by
clothing, tree branches and mud trapped by the tower, one of
several downed lines along the Santa Catarina's bank at the
hardest-hit area.
   Further downstream, two dozen soldiers used cranes to pull the
crushed and overturned body of an intercity passenger bus from the
mud and sand of the riverbed.
   ``They hope to find bodies because they don't know exactly how
many people were in the bus or how many were able to save
themselves,'' said rescue coordinator Lt. Col. Vicente Gamez of the
7th Military Zone.
   The first bus yanked from the riverbed and hauled away revealed
only empty seats, twisted metal and piles of shoes and clothing.
The three other buses remained buried upside down Sunday night.
   Gamez said rescue crews were searching for bodies in Cadereyta,
about 20 miles downstream, where the flood wiped out homes and
killed more than a dozen people.
   Hundreds of families farther downstream were evacuated to public
buildings on higher ground Sunday because of flooding, said
Fernando Gonzalez Villarreal, assistant secretary in the federal
Water Resources Ministry.
   ``The situation is critical. The rain was very strong,'' he said.
   Nuevo Leon state authorities estimated damages to public roads,
bridges and other facilities alone at $60 million.
   Thirteen U.S. Coast Guard airplanes and helicopters flew rescue
missions on Sunday throughout Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas states,
assisting Mexican air forces.
   A Coast Guard helicopter being used for evacuation lost power as
it took off on Sunday and fell about 50 feet, brushing a house
under construction, police reported.
   ``The chopper made a forced landing. Fortunately, no one was
hurt,'' said Lt. Commander John Wcislo, U.S. Coast Guard attache in
Mexico.
   Police said the three Americans and one Mexican on board were
taken to the local hospital for a checkup and released.
   Wcislo said Coast Guard aircraft would continue ferrying people
and Red Cross supplies today if needed.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ Advocates of democratic reform expressed
hope that Haiti's new military leaders would open a dialogue with
the people after ousting Lt. Gen. Henry Namphy, who ran the country
for more than two years.
   Brig. Gen. Prosper Avril, the army's chief administrative
officer, went on national television Sunday and declared himself
president of the Western hemisphere's most impoverished nation.
   He said Namphy was ousted by the 1,000-man Presidential Guard
Saturday night because it was ``sickened'' by his rule, which was
marked by a tolerance for the murder of government opponents.
   Avril was a military adviser to Jean-Claude Duvalier before the
dictator's February 1986 flight into exile and has since managed to
ally himself with the prevailing forces in the 7,000-man military.
   The government said an unspecified number of soldiers were
reported killed in the coup, and Namphy was sent to the Dominican
Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti.
   Port-au-Prince appeared calm Sunday night, though the U.S. and
Canadian embassies advised their citizens to stay off the streets.
Small groups of people milled in the streets and traffic was light.
Television and radio stations resumed their normal programming.
   The airport, which was closed Sunday, was expected to reopen
today.
   But for the four-month civilian presidency of Leslie Manigat,
which ended in June with a bloodless coup, Namphy had run Haiti
since Duvalier's departure, heading a military-led junta until
Manigat was elected in January in junta-run balloting that was
widely boycotted.
   On Nov. 29, independently run elections were thwarted by armed
thugs supported by the army who killed 34 people at the polls.
   And a week before the coup, about 20 men armed with machetes,
handguns and steel pikes attacked a Roman Catholic Church during a
Mass being celebrated by the Rev. Jean Bertrand Aristide, a vocal
critic of the Namphy government. Thirteen people were killed and 77
wounded.
   Opposition leaders blamed the government for the attack and
another church burning two days later.
   Heavy gunfire was heard in the capital Saturday night shortly
before the coup, but Susan Clyde, spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy
here, said ``it appeared to be mainly celebratory shooting in the
air, nobody shooting at anyone or anything.''
   Frantz Lubin, Haiti's director of information, said an
unspecified number of soldiers were killed.
   Radio stations reported that at least six people were killed in
the capital in coup-related clashes and that mobs pillaged two
homes owned by Namphy and the home of Port-au-Prince Mayor Franck
Romain.
   Although motives for the coup were unclear, it appeared the
soldiers and non-commissioned officers of the elite Presidential
Guard were disenchanted with Namphy's authoritarian rule.
   A Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the Presidential Guard had given the army's High Command a list of
19 demands for forming a new government, including democratic
reform and better living conditions for soldiers.
   All the demands were accepted, the diplomat said, except the
nomination of Col. Jean-Claude Paul as military commander-in-chief.
Paul has been indicted on federal drug-trafficking charges in
Florida.
   Paul, commander of the dreaded 700-man Dessaline unit, had been
regarded as the most powerful figure in Haiti after Namphy. It was
not known if Paul played a part in the coup, but sources said he
and Namphy were at odds.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Anita Stockman said
the United States still wanted Paul extradited to face the drug
charges.
   Initial reaction to the coup from advocates of democratic reform
was positive, but cautious.
   ``I will support the military government if they say as soon as
possible when they will call elections,'' said Louis Dejoie II,
leader of the national Agricultural Industrial Party. ``We are
ready to speak with any government that respects human rights.''
   In his statement to the nation early Sunday, Avril said Haiti
will respect all international treaties, liberties and human rights
and that ``dialogue will be honored for the sake of national
reconciliation.''
   The statement was considered significant because it echoed a
recent offer for dialogue from opposition leader Marc Bazin, a
conservative leader of the Committee for Democratic Understanding.
   Bazin and Dejoie were among four leading candidates for
president in the Nov. 29 elections and boycotted the elections won
by Manigat.
   Dejoie said he expected the military to announce when elections
would be held in the next week or so.
   ``They must do it or they won't have any support,'' Dejoie said.
``The army right now has to regain its credibility. We want to give
them a chance with this new change of guard.''
   Avril has been a key behind-the-scenes figure in a succession of
governments since nationwide riots forced Duvalier to flee to
France. Duvalier had been president since the 1971 death of his
father, Francois Duvalier, who ruled since 1957.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Prosper Avril, a quiet, studious
50-year-old career soldier, has emerged from the shadows of Haitian
politics to proclaim himself president of this violence-wracked
republic.
   Avril, a thin, bespectacled man, looked more like a college
professor than a soldier when he announced on national television
Sunday that he was ``persuaded'' by the Presidential Guard to head
the military government. Only his dress uniform and military cap
gave him away.
   ``I find myself forced to accept the office of president of the
military government,'' the soft-spoken new president said. In the
same breath Avril, a brigadier general and adjutant general,
announced he had promoted himself to lieutenant general.
   Avril, a career soldier of humble origin, was born in the small
town of Thomageau, a short distance from the capital. But close
associates say he is extremely intelligent and has used the army to
manipulate his way to power and riches. He is believed to be a
millionaire.
   His career has always been linked closely to those who wield
power in Haiti.
   Early on, he caught the eye of Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier,
the country doctor who founded the Duvalier political dynasty more
than 30 years ago.
   Avril graduated at the head of his class from the military
academy during the first year of Duvalier's rule. He was a
classmate of Brig. Gen. Williams Regala, who later would be part of
the five-man provisional government which ruled Haiti immediately
after Duvalier's son, Jean-Claude Duvalier, fled to exile on Feb.
7, 1986.
   Always a survivor, Avril served under both Duvaliers and as a
political adviser to Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, who headed the junta
that replaced Jean-Claude.
   Avril is said to get along well with just about everyone and to
have no enemies in the army, which is considered a rare
accomplishment. He was retired by Jean-Claude near the end of his
regime due to a conflict between Avril and Interior Minister Roger
Lafontant, a man known for his brutal methods of maintaining law
and order.
   Although he joined the junta as an adviser, Avril was forced to
resign in early 1986 by massive protest demonstrations seeking the
ouster of all former associates of the Duvaliers.
   With the rank of colonel, he became inspector of the
presidential guard, a job he kept when President Leslie Manigat
took office on Feb. 7, 1988, after being elected in
military-controlled elections boycotted by the most popular
candidates.
   Avril then helped Namphy regain power in a bloodless coup in
June.
   Namphy promoted him to brigadier general and appointed him
adjutant general of the army, an administrative post.
   Avril has always been a staunch supporter of the Duvalier
regime, one of the most oppressive dictatorships in the world until
it was toppled in 1986. He was believed to have had an office at
the National Bank where he managed the special bank accounts of
Jean-Claude.
   Avril is married to a nurse.
   He has no reputation for cruelty and those who know him say he
has two attributes that are rare in the army: a keen political mind
and the ability to listen to others.
   The President Guard sergeant who announced on television that
Namphy had been overthrown, introduced Avril as ``the most honest
man in the Army.''
   Many in Haiti took heart from his promise that ``dialogue will
be honored for the sake of national reconciliation,'' which was
interpreted by many as an offer to negotiate with the democratic
opposition.
   ``This event has come at the right moment to put an end to a
government which was going to lead the country to an abyss. ... We
greet with satisfaction the first declaration of the new
president,'' said an unexpected admirer, Max Bourjolly,
second-in-command of the Haitian Communist Party.

   The dollar inched up today after fluctuating
throughout the day, while share prices rose slightly on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 133.80 yen, a .04-yen gain from Friday's
close of 133.76 yen. Although the currency opened higher at 134.0
yen, it fell slightly after moving in a range of 133.75-134.10 yen.
   The United States on Wednesday announced it had a trade deficit
of $9.5 billion for July. That was less than expected, and the news
led investors to different views on the U.S. currency, according to
Takamasa Yamazaki of the Daiwa Bank.
   ``About 60 percent of the investors thought the dollar was still
strong, but the rest of them thought the dollar would not go any
higher,'' Yamazaki said, adding that the former group bought the
dollar while the latter sold it.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed at
27,901.00, gaining 34.62 points, or 0.12 percent from Friday's
close of 27,866.38. Although the market's major index rose to
28,016.78 shortly after the trading began, it gradually fell.
   ``The market was in pretty good shape. Since late last week,
trading volume has increased,'' said Yoshio Shimoyama of the Nikko
Securities in Tokyo.
   ``The market finally appeared to have regained its energy,'' he
added.
   In a moderate trading with estimated volume of 1 billion shares,
steels and heavy machines attracted investors.

   For many Texas ranchers, Hurricane
Gilbert may turn out to be what the bankers have ordered.
   The hurricane looked for a time as if it might storm its way
into the Hill Country and leave a trail of flooding and
wind-damaged property.
   Instead, the storm broke up mostly into a series of gentle fall
rains that officials say will boost agricultural prospects in the
southwestern part of the state.
   ``It was just about what we wanted _ perfect _ so far,'' said
Don Mathis, director of a Farmers Home Administration district that
governs federal agricultural lending in 26 counties in central
Texas' Hill Country and in the western part of the state.
   ``Most of the territory already has gotten from 2{ to 5 inches
of rain,'' Mathis said Sunday. ``If a lot of these people hadn't
gotten rain, they would have had to sell off a lot of their basic
herd and practically start all over.''
   Until Gilbert's rains, Mathis said, a drought situation ``was
getting critical.''
   Mathis said he will attend a meeting early this week in Oklahoma
City at which adminstration officials will update farm lending
policies. A lack of rain earlier this month had been threatening to
set back what had been a modest economic recovery during the past
two years, he said.
   Evidence of the rainfall shortage could be seen during the past
two weeks at livestock houses, Mathis said. Many ranchers, whose
grazing land was running thin, began dumping sheep and goats in
record numbers at Junction and San Angelo, he said.
   Calf sales also were approaching records, although many of them
were not being sold at ideal weights, Mathis said. Ranchers simply
decided it was more lucrative to sell them now than to purchase
grain and fatten them.
   ``This rain makes a lot of difference,'' he said. ``It's going
to mean the ranchers won't have to buy as much hay for their
livestock this winter.''
   The economic impact won't stop at ranch property lines, Mathis
said.
   ``It's going to make a difference in all our area,'' Mathis
said. ``In many of our little towns, not losing that cash flow is
going to mean a lot.''
   Weather officials said more rain could fall in the Hill Country
and parts of West Texas as what at one time was the most intense
hurricane on record continued to break up and stall against a cold
front encroaching from the northwest.

<TEXT>
   The world's whooping crane population,
down to 16 in 1941, probably will exceed 200 this winter, perhaps
the highest number of the regal white birds this century.
   ``They have taken a nice jump in the last few years,'' said
James Lewis, whooping crane coordinator for the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service in Albuquerque. ``We have to give nature an awful
lot of credit for that.
   ``This is our best year ... since probably early this century or
late last century. We're not sure really. We didn't have good
figures back then, but I'd say it's probably the best since early
this century.''
   Lewis said he expects about 145 cranes from Canada at their
winter grounds at the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge on Texas'
Gulf Coast.
   A flock of 18 birds from Grays Lake National Wildlife Refuge in
southeastern Idaho is expected at its winter grounds primarily
along the central Rio Grande Valley in New Mexico, Lewis said.
   The Grays Lake flock was started in 1975 in an attempt to create
a second whooping crane flock in case disaster should befall the
Canadian flock.
   For more than a decade, biologists have been removing eggs from
whooping crane nests in the Canadian flock and placing them in
sandhill crane nests at the Idaho refuge to boost the number of
whooping cranes there.
   The adopted whooping cranes are raised by their sandhill foster
parents and travel with the sandhill cranes 750 miles to their
winter grounds in New Mexico.
   A captive flock of 47 cranes is at the Patuxent Wildlife
Research Center at Laurel, Md.; another whooping crane lives at the
International Crane Foundation at Baraboo, Wis., and a single
whooping crane lives in a zoo in San Antonio, Texas, Lewis said.
   The long-necked whooping cranes, protected by the federal
Endangered Species Act, are white with black wing tips, typically
stand about 5 feet and can have a 7{-foot wingspan.
   In autumn, the largest flock flies 2,500 miles to Aransas from
its summer nesting grounds at Wood Buffalo National Park in
Canada's Northwest Territory.
   ``In Canada, it's been a good year,'' Lewis said. ``They had 20
to 22 chicks and banded 17 of them in a one-day operation.''
   Wood Buffalo had plenty of water, which could make a prime
nesting season in 1989, he said.
   When there's water, there's plenty of food such as frogs,
crayfish, aquatic insects and tubors for the whooping cranes, Lewis
said.
   High water also cuts losses due to predators.
   ``Predators seem to come in more drought years, and they include
wolves that prey on young chicks before they're flying,'' Lewis
said.
   The peak population at Aransas last winter was 134, and Lewis
said 131 survived to spring migration.
   But while the Canadian wild flock was in summer paradise, the
smaller one, which peaked at 33 in the winter of 1984-85, has had
to endure drought at Grays Lake. Lewis also blamed the flock's loss
of 15 birds on predators.

<HEAD>Gilbert Deals Heavy Blow To Yucatan Tourist Industry</HEAD>

   When Hurricane Gilbert slammed into the
Yucatan Peninsula last week it dealt a crippling blow to Mexico's
vital tourist industry, which depends on the peninsula for
one-fourth of its revenue.
   Antonio Erales, tourism director for the Caribbean resort of
Cancun, estimated storm damage there alone at $429 million.
   He said tourism at Cancun, on this resort island and on the
island of Isla Mujeres will be suspended for up to three months for
repairs.
   ``Cancun will be back to normal possibly in December,'' Erales
said.
   About 90 percent of Cancun's beachfront hotels and all seaside
establishments in Cozumel and Isla Mujeres were damaged by the
storm, which claimed at least 31 lives in the Yucatan.
   In Jamaica, officials said Montego Bay and other big resorts on
the northern coast escaped the worst of the storm.
   Prime Minister Edward Seaga of Jamaica estimated that Gilbert
caused $8 billion worth of damage when it struck on Monday. But of
the island's nearly $600 million-a-year tourism industry, he said:
``I'm glad to say it's in reasonably good shape.''
   Yet most major hotels in Montego Bay bore plain signs of
Gilbert's ferocity _ gaping holes in roofs and ceilings, shattered
windows, standing water, mangled balcony railings.
   Four of Montego Bay's five biggest hotels were shut down because
of damage and the fifth, the Wyndham Rose Hall Beach Hotel and
Country Club, faced costly repairs. Only two of the 15 big
restaurants in the resort area managed to open.
   The extent of the destruction was such that it was difficult to
imagine the famous resort recovering anytime soon, barring a
massive rebuilding program.
   In the Yucatan, officials said they had advised international
tourist agents of the problems in the area, which attracts most of
its visitors from the United States and Europe.
   The stay-aways are sure to hurt tourism, which vies with
Mexico's maquiladora, or in-bond assembly industry, as the
country's second-leading generator of foreign exchange after oil.
   Officials and residents in the Yucatan worry about the impact
Gilbert's destruction will have on the local economy.
   ``About 50,000 people live here and all of us earn our living
from tourism. If the authorities don't solve this problem soon
there will be 50,000 unemployed,'' lamented Lazaro Torre, a
22-year-old lobsterman from Cozumel. About 6,000 tourists visit the
island each week.
   ``What are we going to do?,'' asked Jose Luis Viniegas, an owner
of a small fishing boat company on Cozumel. He said most of his
boats were destroyed in the storm.
   Both Cozumel and Cancun still lacked drinking water, electricity
and telephone service on Sunday. Medical authorities expressed
concern about sanitary conditions.
   Tourists caught in Gilbert's path waited for days to get a
flight home or salvage their vacations with a trip elsewhere. Air
traffic was limited to daylight hours because Gilbert knocked out
runway lights and nighttime radar.
   Miguel Mairu of Venezuela was among 3,500 visibly exhausted
tourists waiting at Cancun Airport Saturday for a seat on one of 13
commerical flights out of the city.
   ``Gilbert dashed all our plans to spend unforgettable days,''
said Mairu, in Cancun for his honeymoon. ``The hotel where we were
staying was destroyed and I spent my wedding night next to my
beautiful wife _ but also with another 600 people who also slept in
the ballroom of another hotel.''
   Some vacationers complained they received little or no warning
that the most powerful storm on record was about to hit.
   ``We got to Cancun on the last flight on Tuesday,'' said Joan
McCarrick, 31, of Hillsdale, N.J. ``We didn't even know anything
about it. We got to our hotel, put our things in our room and went
downstairs to have dinner.
   ``That's when they told us we had to evacuate,'' she said.

<HEAD>Noriega: New Underground Coup Attempts Detected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega says
his forces have detected new attempts to oust him, perhaps linked
to President Reagan's order authorizing covert operations in
Panama, according to a published report.
   In his first U.S. newspaper interview since he was indicted on
federal drug charges by two Florida grand juries in February,
Noriega also told The Miami Herald the Reagan administration has
sent two recent messages inviting him to resume bilateral talks
that collapsed in May.
   The general, commenting on rumors that the U.S. government is
backing dissident Panamanian military officers to promote a coup or
to set up a rebel movement, said his defense forces have spotted
``efforts to contact people'' and ``money to buy people'' for a new
attempt to topple his regime.
   ``We, the military, can never dismiss these kinds of things,''
Noriega said in the interview conducted Thursday near Panama City
and published Sunday. ``In security matters, every information has
to be analyzed and followed.''
   The rumors, he said, escalated two months ago when The
Washington Post reported that Reagan had signed a secret order
authorizing a series of unidentified covert actions aimed at
ousting Noriega. The plan reportedly included ``psychological
warfare'' actions.
   ``We have received information from people who have participated
in these (seditious) meetings,'' Noriega said. ``They are
discussing the kind of plans you make if you are seeking to stage a
coup.''
   Noriega welcomed recent invitations to resume bilateral talks,
calling the U.S. overtures a ``positive step'' and adding that his
government is ready to start ``serious, scientific and realistic''
negotiations immediately.
   U.S. officials confirmed that there have been meetings with
``members of the ruling coalition'' in the last few days, but added
these were part of ``regular meetings with a cross-section of
Panamanian political leaders,'' the Herald said. They denied these
were proposals for new negotiations.
   Noriega said he is ready to meet face-to-face with ousted
President Eric Delvalle ``without preconditions,'' if that helps
solve Panama's crisis.
   Previously, Noriega has said he would never sit down with
Delvalle, who unsuccessfully tried to fire him as commander of
Panama's Defense Forces early this year.
   The U.S. government last May offered to lift two drug
indictments against Noriega, if he would step down. Both
presidential candidates, Vice President George Bush and
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, have said they oppose a deal
that would result in dismissal of the indictments.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Saw Maung, leader of a military
coup that has led to renewed bloodshed in Burma, is a hardliner who
has loyally taken orders from strongman Ne Win throughout most of
his 39-year military career.
   Citing mounting chaos, Saw Maung on Sunday ousted civilian
President Maung Maung, set up a ``Peace Restoration Committee''
with himself as chairman, abolished most organs of state and
imposed a curfew on Rangoon, the capital.
   Saw Maung promised multiparty general elections when order was
restored, but people took to the streets of Rangoon today to
protest his seizure of power, and troops fired on them, reportedly
killing dozens.
   Most protesters were unarmed.
   Analysts had never ruled out the possibility of a coup by the
186,000-strong armed forces, the only well organized group left in
Burma. But events had appeared to be moving toward a compromise
between opposition leaders and the entrenched old guard.
   Though little is known about Saw Maung, he is widely considered
close to both Ne Win and the ruthless former President Sein Lwin.
Many Western diplomats in Rangoon believe both men remain the key
power brokers in Burma, despite their official resignations.
   Saw Maung, 59, was named defense minister July 27 in Sein Lwin's
government, which subsequently ordered troops to gun down unarmed
protesters. Faced by huge, national demonstrations, Sein Lwin
resigned Aug. 12 after 17 days in power, but Saw Maung maintained
both his defense portfolio and post as head of the armed forces.
   His close association with Sein Lwin, described by opponents as
``the most hated man in Burma,'' may have helped provoke today's
displays of outrage on Rangoon's streets.
   Saw Maung was also criticized earlier by key opposition figure
Aung Gyi for bypassing the prescribed chain-of-command when he
ordered the 44th Light Infantry Division into Rangoon in March to
put down student-led demonstrations with brutal force.
   ``He lacks the intellectual gifts of his predecessors at that
post and, therefore, is seen as easily manipulated by the two top
leaders,'' wrote Burma expert Bertil Lintner in a recent issue of
the Hong Kong-based news magazine Far Eastern Economic Review.
   Orders from the top men _ Ne Win and Sein Lwin _ are normally
executed by Saw Maung's deputy, Maj. Gen. Than Shwe, who Lintner
described as ``a ruthless field commander who is more feared than
respected by his subordinates.''
   Than Shwe was listed in the No. 2 position on the 19-member
Peace Restoration Commitee.
   According to official records, Saw Maung was born in Mandalay
and studied at a high school in that former royal capital.
   He joined the army in 1949, one year after Burma gained
independence from Britain. Although he was not of Ne Win's
generation, which fought first against the British and then the
Japanese in World War II, Saw Maung appeared to have gained the
general's favor.
   By 1967, five years after Ne Win's military coup against a
democratically elected government, Saw Maung became a battalion
commander and major. From 1975 to 1976 he headed the 99th Light
Infantry Division, which fought communist insurgents and ethnic
minority Kachin rebels in remote frontier areas.
   An alleged coup attempt by some military officers against Ne Win
in 1976 saw a major purge of army ranks. ``Those who stayed on and
did well had to prove their loyalty,'' notes Josef Silverstein, a
Burma scholar at New Jersey's Rutgers University.
   Saw Maung was rewarded in 1976 with the Southwest Command, one
of nine regional military commands in Burma. He held the position
until 1981 when he became the adjutant general.
   Two years later he was named army commander, or the vice chief
of staff for the army in Burma, and deputy defense minister. He was
promoted to chief of staff, or armed forces commander, in 1985.

   The dollar eased in early European trading today
and gold prices continued to fall.
   Foreign currency dealers in Frankfurt, West Germany, said there
was some light selling pressure as some market participants tested
the dollar's downside looking for weak points.
   Dealers in London said the dollar is not expected to venture
outside the trading ranges it established last week but could ease
toward the bottom of that range.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar inched up 0.04 yen to close at 133.80 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 133.90 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday:
   _1.8690 West German marks, down from 1.8763
   _1.5800 Swiss francs, down from 1.5835
   _6.3500 French francs, down from 6.3795
   _2.1087 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1151
   _1,393.35 Italian lire, down from 1,398.50
   _1.2225 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2232
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6765, little changed from
$1.6758 late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $407.25 a troy ounce,
down from $412.00 bid late Friday. At midmorning Monday, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $409.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $408.50, down from $411.00 bid late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 3.07 to close at a bid $411.40.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.27 a troy
ounce, down from Friday's $6.40.

<TEXT>
   Emperor Hirohito was running a fever today for a
second straight day and Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita canceled a
scheduled meeting with the 87-year-old monarch, officials said.
   Hirohito had a fever of about 100.4 degrees during a checkup
this morning, but ``he is feeling well and his appetite is
normal,'' said an Imperial Household Agency official.
   Hirohito, the world's longest reigning monarch, will stay in bed
``all day,'' the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   On Sunday morning, Hirohito had a fever of 100.4 degrees that
forced him to cancel a planned visit to watch a wrestling meet. His
temperature later dropped to normal and he watched the matches on
television, the official said.
   Doctors said today that the fever might have been caused by a
slight inflammation of the bilitary tract, according to the
official. On Sept. 22, 1987, Hirohito underwent an intestinal
bypass operation.
   He had previously fallen sick on Aug. 29 and Sept. 3 when he was
resting at an Imperial villa in Nasu, northeastern Japan.
   Meanwhile, Takeshita canceled a meeting with the emperor during
which he was supposed to brief Hirohito on his recent trip to South
Korea, a top government spokesman said.
   The prime minister customarily reports to the emperor on major
diplomatic and domestic events.
   Keizo Obuchi, chief Cabinet secretary, said the government has
yet to decide whether to cancel future meetings between
high-ranking government officials and the emperor.
   Obuchi said he has not heard of any immediate hospitalization
plans for the emperor. ``The Imperial Household Agency and court
doctors are giving the appropriate treatment'' to the emperor, he
said.

<HEAD>Wind Knocks Out Power in Colorado; Remnants of Gilbert Cause Rain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain from what had been Hurricane Gilbert extended from Texas to
Illinois this morning, and winds whipped cold air through the
northern and central Rockies and knocked out electricity in several
Colorado towns.
   Strong thunderstorms stretched across the northern Plains and
across the upper Mississippi Valley, middle Missouri Valley and
central Plains.
   Winds up to 92 mph felled trees and utility lines and caused
power outages in several cities from the Wyoming border south to
the Denver metropolitan area, authorities said.
   The biggest outage occurred in Fort Collins, Colo., where some
5,000 utility customers lost power Sunday night. All but about 500
had their power restored by this morning.
   ``Lots of trees down, lots of lines, lots of calls,'' said Carol
Hendry, a Boulder County sheriff's office dispatcher.
   Dan Leszcynski of the National Weather Service in Denver said
the strong winds had no relation to Gilbert's remains.
   The tropical depression that was once the center of Gilbert was
located over central Oklahoma this morning, moving northeast at 45
to 50 mph.
   Rainfall in the 12 hours that ended 3 a.m. EDT totaled 1 to 2
inches in western Oklahoma. Locally heavier rains produced 3 to 4
inches, some areas reported up to 8 inches of rain since Saturday.
   Rain also fell across the Pacific Northwest, and gale warnings
were posted for the Washington and Oregon coast this morning.
   A freeze warning has been posted for the Cache Valley in Utah
tonight. Freeze advisories have been issued for parts of Wyoming
and Colorado.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from the
northern Plains into the upper Great Lakes south to the lower Ohio
Valley.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms were expected from eastern
parts of the Plains across Arkansas, the Tennessee Valley and
western areas of the central Appalachians into western New York
state. Widely scattered thunderstorms were predicted in Alabama,
southern Georgia and Florida.
   Rain also was forecast in Pacific Northwest, and mountains of
western Montana and northern Idaho.
   Winds should be gusty at times from the northern Plains across
the upper Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes region.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 70s and 80s in much of
the East; 90s in the Gulf Coast states; 60s from northern Minnesota
across the northern Plains to the northern and central Rockies; 60s
and 70s from the Rockies to the West Coast; 80s and 90s in the
desert Southwest and California's interior valleys.
   The nation's temperatures at 3 a.m. ranged from 24 degrees at
Lake Yellowstone, Wyo., to 85 at Blythe, Calif.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II ended a 10-day tour
of southern Africa today with a call for peace and racial justice
in the region, but South African anti-apartheid leaders said he was
not tough enough on Pretoria.
   In a farewell speech at Maputo's airport before flying to Rome,
the pontiff said southern Africa is a region ``where woeful
violations of human rights persist.''
   He said each person should enjoy ``fundamental rights, without
any restrictions or limitations justified by racial segregation or
social discrimination.''
   Officials of Mozambique's Marxist government, who previously
have denounced local Roman Catholic bishops for urging negotiations
with guerrillas, said the pope's visit would improve church-state
relations.
   But activist clergymen from South Africa said the pontiff should
have spoken out more forcefully against their white-minority
government's policies of apartheid, under which 26 million blacks
have no say in national affairs.
   The pope has ``given the South African government more comfort
than it deserved,'' said the Rev. Allan Boesak, president of the
World Alliance of Reformed Churches.
   He spoke at a news conference after he and other Protestant
clergy from South Africa attended a papal Mass and joined
Mozambican church leaders at a meeting with John Paul.
   The pontiff began his trip in Zimbabwe. He also visited
Botswana, Swaziland and Lesotho and made a brief, unscheduled stop
in South Africa when his plane was diverted in bad weather.
   Boesak said the three-hour papal stop in Johannesburg was a
propaganda coup for South African authorities, who had complained
about the omission of their country from the official itinerary.
   South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha greeted the pope,
ordered a security force escort for a motorcade to Lesotho and
later boasted about South Africa's hospitality.
   ``Anyone who enters into dialogue with the South African
government must be aware that they are going to use you for their
own purposes,'' said Boesak.
   One of Boesak's colleagues, the Rev. Frank Chikane, said the
pope had met with officials who ``hurt us and cause us pain'' and
had been escorted by ``people who torture us.''
   Chikane is secretary-general of the South African Council of
Churches, which is leading a civil disobedience campaign
challenging emergency regulations and apartheid laws.
   John Paul spoke out several times during his trip against racial
injustice. He also condemned all types of violence and suggested he
was unenthusiastic about confrontational anti-apartheid strategies
such as sanctions and election boycotts.
   In Mozambique, the pope urged both sides in the country's
11-year civil war to cease fighting and proposed a wordwide effort
to rebuild the country.
   ``With violence, nothing can be built and much is lost,'' he
said, urging Mozambicans to follow ``the path of dialogue and
reconciliation which will stop the spilling of blood among
brothers.''
   The government, despite its opposition to negotiations,
responded mildly.
   Jose Luis Cabaco, a Foreign Affairs Department official, said
the pope's appeal conformed with a government offer of amnesty to
rebels who surrender.
   Cabaco also said the papal visit ``brought the government and
the church into joint committees where we had to look each other in
the eyes and talk, something we had not been doing.''
   Civil war has left about 6 million of Mozambique's 14.5 million
people in need of foreign food aid.
   ``This nation needs assistance from other peoples and from the
international community,'' the pope said. ``Let me stress the
urgency of this solidarity, aimed at a quick, total pacification
and immediate aid grants to save a large amount of human lives.''

<HEAD>Government Resigns Under Criticism For Mishandling The Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Zbigniew Messner today
announced the resignation of his government, which had been under
fire for its ineffectual handling of the nation's ailing economy.
   The resignations come less than a month after Poland's most
serious labor unrest in seven years.
   The government has been criticized as sluggish in implementing a
broad economic reform plan this year and for its handling of price
hikes, which have resulted in annual inflation of 60 percent.
   In a speech to parliament, Messner offered a defense of his
government's performance but admitted to ``mishaps,'' implicitly
acknowledging that his government had lost public confidence.
   It was not announced when a new government would be named, and
it was possible that Messner or some of his ministers could be
reappointed by the Sejm, or parliament. Under Sejm rules, a new
government need not be appointed immediately.
   In Poland, the Communist Party is the actual seat of power and
appoints the government through its majority in parliament. The
government is responsible for executing the goals of the party,
which is led by Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski.
   The party has criticized the price-hike operation because wages,
under pressure from workers, were allowed to rise faster than
prices, wiping out any benefits to the economy from the higher
prices.
   The inflation sparked a wave of strikes in April. A second wave
broke out in August, and ended only when authorities and Solidarity
chairman Lech Walesa agreed on entering into broad-based
discussions that could include the reinstatement of the banned free
trade union movement.
   In his speech, Messner, the prime minister since 1985, appeared
to dispute a recent emphasis on dialogue with the opposition and to
make an appeal for support from hardliners within the party.
   ``We are paying for (the strikes) now with escalation of demands
and greater chaos in the market, loss of authority of management.
We again have become a symbol of anarchy in the world,'' Messner
said.
   ``Political methods of solving tensions cannot mean tolerance
for law-breaking,'' he said.
   Before Messner's speech, the Sejm, or parliament, heard a
critical report from an extraordinary committee set up to monitor
the government's performance in implementing economic reform.
   Jaruzelski had recently distanced himself from Messner.
   At a Communist Party meeting Aug. 28, during the last strike
wave, he criticized the government's performance and called on
parliament to decide its future at this month's meeting.
   Later, the official trade union alliance OPZZ passed a
resolution calling for the government to resign.
   On Sunday, Walesa told 50,000 pilgrims at a workers' Mass in the
southern city of Czestochowa that the government is close to
recognizing Solidarity, which was banned in a 1981 military
crackdown that ended its 15-month heyday.
   Walesa addressed hundreds of Solidarity delegations from across
the country who converged on the Jasna Gora monastery for an annual
pilgrimage of workers.
   It was the first public address by Walesa since he announced
Friday that Solidarity agreed to participate in talks on legalizing
the union, which was banned in 1982. The talks are set for
mid-October.
   Walesa agreed to end a wave of strikes last month after the
government agreed to talks on Solidarity's future.
   Walesa spoke at the end of a rainy outdoor Mass celebrated by
Cardinal Henryk Gulbinowicz, archbishop of Wroclaw.
   ``Solidarity is very close. Solidarity will be when we are
really listening and if we turn our slogans into action,'' Walesa
told the crowd spread out on a plain below the fortress walls of
the 600-year-old monastery.
   ``I want to thank (the priests at the Mass) for feeling what I

listen,'' he said, without elaborating. It was an apparent
reference to recent talks between the union and authorities.

   Country music singer Hank Williams Jr.
says he doesn't miss the early years of his career when his fans
saw him as a rebel.
   ``And I don't miss the fact that I wasn't the happiest person in
the world back then,'' said Williams, the Country Music
Association's reigning Entertainer of the Year.
   ``You know, I did some pretty wild things. To myself, to houses
and cars. No, I don't miss that part of me at all,'' he said in
Sunday's edition of The Tennessean of Nashville.
   Williams, 39-year-old son of the legendary singer Hank Williams
and whose hits include ``Family Tradition'' and ``All My Rowdy
Friends are Coming Over Tonight,'' made 35 albums between ages 14
and 26.
   It wasn't until he was in his 30s that awards began pouring in.

<TEXT>
   A crack-addicted paroled killer has been
arrested in the slaying of a young woman shot during a $27 holdup
one week after she arrived from Arkansas to pursue her dream of
being an artist, police said.
   ``He is a local crack addict who spends a lot of time on the
street,'' police Deputy Inspector Charles Prestia said of
37-year-old Frank DeChirico. ``We believe the robbery was for the
purpose of getting money for drugs.''
   DeChirico was arrested Saturday and charged with murdering
Judith Ann Wrappe, 24, a native of Little Rock, Ark., and a
first-year graduate student at Pratt Institute.
   She had been in the city seven days when she was mugged about 1
a.m. Wednesday. Police said she refused to give up her purse and
was shot in the chest.
   Police said DeChirico was out on parole since 1986 after serving
13{ years for manslaughter. Since 1966, police said, he was
arrested nine other times on charges that included robbery, drug
possession, grand larceny and burglary.
   Prestia said investigators identified DeChirico through
witnesses and street sources.
   The unemployed oil burner maintenance worker also was charged
with robbery, Prestia said.
   DeChirico stole $27 in the mugging, police said. Miss Wrappe's
purse contained $1 and other personal effects when found by police.
   ``It makes me feel better that he's off the street,'' said the
victim's mother, Sue Wrape, said in a telephone interview from
Little Rock. Her daughter spelled her surname name differently.
   ``I'm sure the police and the judicial system will take care of
it from here and we can count on justice being done,'' she said.
   The arrest came hours after hundreds mourned Miss Wrappe at a
Mass in her hometown. Bishop Andrew J. McDonald remembered her as a
gifted artist who ``marched to a different drummer'' and ``was not
afraid to be different.''

<HEAD>Kidnappers Release New Photo, Statement On Four Hostages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The captors of four foreign hostages _
including three Americans _ have issued another statement saying
they would consider freeing the men if the United States expressed
support for the 9-month-old Palestinian uprising.
   The handwritten Arabic language statement, signed by the Islamic
Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine, was accompanied by a
photograph showing the four hostages playing cards. It was
delivered Sunday to the Beirut office of a Western news agency and
Beirut's An-Nahar newspaper.
   The four men were kidnapped Jan. 24, 1987 from the campus of the
U.S.-affilitated Beirut University College. They are Alann Steen,
49, a journalism instructor; Jesse Turner, 41, a visiting professor
of mathematics and computer science; Robert Polhill, 55, a lecturer
in accounting; and Mithileshwar Singh, 60, a visiting professor of
finance and a legal resident alien of the United States.
   The kidnappers first offered to free the four in a statement
released Thursday. The latest statement, like the previous one,
said the hostages would be freed if the United States declares
support for the Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine is believed to be
made up of Shiite Moslem zealots loyal to Iran and sympathetic to
the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   ``This initiative still stands and we are waiting for responses
in light of which we shall take the next steps required by the
interests of the blessed uprising,'' the statement said.
   ``Our inclination to free the hostages is not an invitation for
negotiations, but it comes within our conviction of human and
ethical values,'' it said.
   That appeared to be a reply to the U.S. State Department's
assertion, in response to Thursday's statement, that it was
unwilling to negotiate with the kidnappers.
   The recent statements by the captors has triggered speculation
that they are softening their demands.
   The group previously had demanded the release of 400 Arab
prisoners held by Israel and its militia allies in south Lebanon.
Israel refused to free anyone.
   They four educators are among 17 foreigners missing and believed
kidnapped in Lebanon since March 1985. The others are six
Americans, three Britons, an Irishman, an Italian and two
unidentified men.
   The longest held is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped in Beirut
on March 16, 1985.

   A small fire broke out today in the U.S. Embassy
in Moscow, but was extinguished within a few minutes and caused no
damage or injury, the embassy said.
   An embassy statement said the fire began at about 10:30 a.m. in
the fuel tank of a torch being used for repair work in a stairwell.
   As a precaution, the building was evacuated, but employees and
visitors returned after about five minutes, the statement said.
   U.S. press attache Richard Gilbert said the fire, which was
confined to the stairwell, was put out in about five minutes by
embassy staff. Soviet firefighters arrived, but their help was not
needed, Gilbert said.
   On Feb. 17, a fire began on the fifth floor in the same section
of the embassy and was quickly put out. There were no injuries. In
April, a fire in an unused kitchen of the residence of U.S.
Ambassador Jack Matlock destroyed some American art stored there.

   A stolen car loaded with
limpet mines exploded today in a garage under an apartment
building, injuring a 6-year-old boy and damaging more than 30 cars,
police said.
   They said the explosion also shattered windows in the four-story
building about 300 feet from the police station in Benoni, 18 miles
east of Johannesburg.
   The child was cut by flying glass and several people were
treated for shock, police said.
   They said the pre-dawn blast was one of the most powerful of
more than 40 bombings in South Africa this year.
   Authorities have blamed most of the previous bombings on the
outlawed African National Congress, the main guerrilla movement
fighting the South African government and its policy of apartheid.
The ANC acknowledges waging a bombing and sabotage campaign, but
generally does not comment on individual incidents.
   Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the
26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs, which are
controlled by 5 million whites.

<HEAD>Art Institute Opens New Wing With Major Gauguin Exhibition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Art Institute of Chicago has opened a new $23
million wing with the most comprehensive exhibit of Paul Gauguin's
work in more than 80 years.
   About 250 people attended a ribbon-cutting Saturday for the
Daniel F. and Ada L. Rice Building, the largest addition to the
museum in its 109-year history.
   The three-story building increases the museum's gallery space by
nearly a third _ from 168,100 square feet to 222,760 square feet.
   Of the nation's major art museums, the Art Institute trails only
the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, the Philadelphia
Museum of Art and The National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.,
in gallery space.
   The Gauguin show, running until Dec. 11, includes more than 250
works from private and public collections around the world. It
showcases other sides of Gauguin's art besides the colorful
Tahitian and South Sea Island paintings for which he is best known.
   Museum spokeswoman Eileen Harakal said it is the most
comprehensive exhibition of Gauguin's work since 1906, when the
Salon d'Automne in Paris mounted an exhibition three years after
the artist's death.
   Construction of the building is part of a long-range $57 million
plan launched in 1982 to renovate the Art Institute. The Rice
Foundation donated $10 million to the museum.

<HEAD>Congressman's Wife Wife Reveals Brother Has AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GARDEN GROVE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A town meeting erupted into a
shouting match when the wife of Rep. Bob Dornan screamed, ``Shut
up, fag'' at a gay activist. Then, in a public apology, she
revealed to her husband that her brother is dying of AIDS.
   Sallie Dornan shouted the epithet at Jeff LeTourneau during a
heated exchange Sunday between the gay activist and her husband, a
conservative Republican.
   LeTourneau and about 30 other chanting protesters were then
escorted from the auditorium by police at Dornan's request, but
LeTourneau was allowed to return and pose the last question of the
session. He demanded an apology.
   ``I'm very sorry I did that,'' said Mrs. Dornan, her voice
breaking. ``You were all yelling at my husband, whom I love.
   ``I apologize, but it will not rid the anger in my heart. My
brother is dying. ... I want you to understand there's great anger
and pain inside of me.''
   She later told reporters that one of her four brothers is a
homosexual and is dying of AIDS. The congressman said he knew his
brother-in-law is a homosexual but not that he has acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
   ``To tell you the truth, I didn't know until this minute,'' said
the Orange County congressman, who then asked his wife, ``Why
didn't you tell me?''
   ``I didn't want to hurt you,'' she said.
   She had yelled ``Shut up, fag'' at LeTourneau during an argument
he and Democratic opponent Jerry Yudelson were having with Dornan
over the congressman's vote to give foreign aid to the Bolivian
government.
   LeTourneau accepted Mrs. Dornan's apology.
   LeTourneau had earlier organized a rally of a gay rights group
to protest Dornan's stand on gay issues. Dornan is seeking a third
term.
   About 25 people participated in the rally. Some group wore
T-shirts reading ``Queer and Present Danger,'' and demonstrators in
black shrouds carried a mock coffin and read names of those who had
died of AIDS.
   After the session, LeTourneau said Dornan had denounced the term
``gay'' on the House floor and refused to back legislation to bar
discrimination based on sexual preference.
   Dornan confirmed he opposed the legislation but said he has been
``on the cutting edge'' of anti-AIDS legislation, contributed part
of his $12,400 pay raise to help AIDS hospices and helped publicize
the issue of AIDS.
   Dornan said his ``heart goes out'' to homosexuals, ``but I am
not going to let them wreck every town hall meeting.''

<HEAD>Social Democrats Ward Off Election Challenge From Greens;
Communists Gain</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS 12 grafs with election results, details. Picks up graf

<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Social Democratic party, presiding
over a booming economy, fought off a challenge from the
environmentalist Greens to retain its hold on a minority government
in parliamentary elections.
   Nearly complete results from Sunday's balloting gave the Greens
a place in the 349-member Riksdag, or parliament, for the first
time with 20 seats. However, the Greens were denied the key role as
a legislative power broker.
   Results today from all but a few mailed ballots, invalid returns
or votes for splinter parties showed the Social Democrats won 156
parliament seats, or 43.6 percent _ a loss of three seats from the
1985 elections.
   The Communist party won 21 seats to finish fifth with 5.9
percent of the vote, a gain of two. Although there is no formal
agreement, the Communists tacitly support the Social Democrats and
guarantee their ability to govern.
   The conservative opposition Moderates, with 66 seats, or 17.9
percent, finished a distant second.
   The Liberals came in third with 44 seats, or 12.2 percent; next
came the Center Party, with 42 seats, or 11.4 percent; the
Communists; and the Greens, with 5.5 percent. The Christian
Democrats won no seats although they got 3 percent of the vote.
   The Greens, the first new party to enter parliament in 70 years,
drew most of their support from non-socialist opposition parties,
which suffered their worst combined defeat since World War II.
   Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson, who took office after the 1986
assassination of Olof Palme, said, ``We have ridden out the storm
and stood steady in the wind, and we have won.''
   Carlsson admitted he had felt ``a bit nervous'' leading the
Social Democrats in an election for the first time.
   Moderates leader Carl Bildt claimed the outcome showed hope for
the opposition and the beginning of a decline for the Social
Democrats, which lost support in the big cities ``where political
attitudes change faster.''
   Pre-election polls incorrectly predicted the Communists would
fail to win the 4 percent minimum for a seat in the unicameral
chamber. Many people were believed to have voted for the Social
Democrats to ensure the party's survival, resulting in what party
leader Lars Werner called its best election in 40 years.
   The entry of the Greens will have little impact on the workings
of the Riksdag, but could prove disruptive in the future, some
political commentators said.
   Voter turnout was 86.4 percent, the lowest in 28 years.
   Swedish television, broadcasting the official results, said
about 2 percent, slightly more than ususal, cast blank ballots or
voted for one of about 100 fringe parties as a protest vote.
   According to pre-election surveys, about 10 percent of the
voters made up their minds in the last few days.
   The Social Democrats, architects of Sweden's welfare state, had
been shaken by a series of mishaps earlier this year, including a
politically risky attempt to sponsor a private investigation into
Palme's unsolved murder. The popular justice minister, Anna-Greta
Leijon, was forced to resign in June for overstepping her authority
in the affair.
   Carlsson admitted the irregular probe and reports of illegal
arms sales by Swedish companies had hurt the party. ``We would have
done better'' if not for the scandals, he said.
   Carlsson targeted the final weeks of the campaign on management
of the economy at a time when business profits and wages were high,
unemployment was reduced to 1.7 percent and public spending was
brought into line.
   He also played on disunity in the opposition, recalling their
chaotic six years in office, during which they had four
governments. The Social Democrats, who had governed for 44 years
from 1932, returned to power in 1982.
   The opposition parties attacked the government's failure to curb
inflation, which has been running at 7 percent. They campaigned for
reforms to reduce income taxes that slice 75 percent off the top
brackets. Taxes in Sweden equal more than 55 percent of the gross
national product, the highest in the world.
   Foreign Minister Sten Andersson attributed his party's victory
to a healthy economy and a platform of careful tax reform.
   ``We wanted to develop welfare, while the other parties wanted
to dismantle parts of it ... That is very stupid of them,'' he said.
   Pre-election predictions had said the Greens, officially called
the Environment Party, would hold the balance of power between the
left and the center-right blocs, giving the novice party unusual
leverage.

Movie</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nine youths who descended on their victims
``in a frenzy, like sharks'' were charged in a series of robberies
and attacks during a rap concert Sept. 10 that left one person dead
and 12 injured, police said.
   Police arrested the suspects, ages 16 to 22, at their homes in
Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant section late Friday and early
Saturday, the police said.
   Police were led to the suspects after they bragged about the
attacks, which took place at the Nassau Coliseum on Long Island,
said Detective Sgt. John Nolan, head of the Nassau County homicide
division.
   In Philadelphia, two youths were shot and hundreds of others
involved in fights Friday night at two theaters premiering the rap
movie ``Tougher Than Leather.'' Neither shooting victim was
seriously injured.
   At the Long Island concert, the youths walked in clusters,
making squealing noises to distract their victims, and snatched
their jewelry, Nolan said.
   If the victim resisted, Nolan said, the youths would ``surround
him, envelop him, beat, stab and slash him with razor blades before
he knew what had happened.''
   ``They were in a frenzy, like sharks feeding,'' Nolan said.
   Julio Fuentes, 19, was stabbed to death after chasing youths who
ripped a gold chain and a four-inch gold M from his girlfriend's
neck, police said.
   Five other concert-goers were stabbed, three were slashed with
razors, and four were punched, kicked or clubbed, police said.
   Four of those arrested were charged with murder and jailed
without bail. Other charges included larceny, riot and conspiracy.

   Iran said its 8-year-old war with Iraq
claimed the lives of 123,220 soldiers and 11,000 civilians.
   Islamic Guidance and Culture Minister Mohammad Khatami also said
in an interview Sunday that 60,711 other military personnel were
listed as missing in action. Khatami, speaking on Tehran radio,
monitored in Nicosia, said Iran believed many of the missing are
prisoners of war in Iraq.
   The death toll cited by Khatami was well below estimates of
300,000 Iranians killed that Western military analysts considered
to be conservative. It was the first time Tehran announced war
casualty figures.
   Iraqi officials have claimed more than 800,000 Iranians were
killed before a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire took effect Aug. 20.
   Khatami gave no figures for Iran's wounded. Western analysts
estimated earlier this year that 600,000 to 700,000 people had been
wounded in the war.
   U.S. and other Western analysts have estimated 120,000 Iraqis
were killed and 300,000 wounded in the conflict.
   Iran held a 3-1 manpower edge over its foe, but for much of the
war the Iraqis fought from heavily fortified defense lines that
helped minimize their casualties.
   Khatami, who is also a deputy commander at military
headquarters, said Iran's Revolutionary Guards suffered the worst
casualties, with 79,664 killed.
   The Revolutionary Guards bore the brunt of the fighting and
repeatedly launched human-wave offensives against Iraq's formidable
defenses.
   Khatami said 35,170 soldiers of the regular army were killed.
The officer corps of the army, built up by Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi, was crippled by revolutionary purges after the monarch was
toppled by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's Islamic Revolution in 1979.
   Khatami said 5,061 members of the paramilitary gendarmerie also
were killed, while a military engineering force lost 2,075 people.
In addition, 1,270 police and revolutionary committee members were
killed, he said.
   The Iranian minister said Iraqi attacks on Iranian cities
claimed the lives of 11,000 civilians.
   Diplomatic sources said several thousand civilians were slain in
a seven-week ``war of the cities'' earlier this year, when Iraq
fired about 300 long-range missiles into Tehran and other cities.
   Towns along the border were shelled almost daily by Iraqi
artillery and short-range rockets.
   Authorities in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad listed 18,000
Iranian prisoners of war in July but said the total was probably
closer to 35,000 because many Iranians were captured in offensives
shortly before the cease-fire.
   Iran has told the International Committee of the Red Cross that
it holds 46,098 Iraqis. But a U.N. team that visited Iranian
prisoner camps July 23-30 estimated the figure was closer to 70,000.

   A star-studded, seven-hour telethon raised
nearly $4.8 million for social services and drug rehabilitation
programs run by a national organization of Hasidic Jews, a
spokesman said today.
   Donors pledged $4,786,237 during the eighth annual ``L'Chaim-To
Life!'' telethon held from 5 p.m. to midnight Sunday, said telethon
spokesman Ron Solomon.
   The program was broadcast in Los Angeles and New York and
featured such stars as Valerie Harper, Ned Beatty, Estelle Getty,
Elliott Gould, Jack Klugman, Steve Landesberg, Judd Nelson, Ron
Perlman, Charlotte Rae, Jon Voight and John Ritter.
   Last year's telethon raised just over $4 million for Chabad of
California, a group run by ultra-Orthodox Hasidic Jews, Solomon
said.
   The money raised is used for a variety of social and drug
rehabilitation programs, including Chabad's new 22-bed women's drug
treatment facility, where patients can be accompanied by their
children.

   Israel today successfully launched test
satellite Horizon-I over the Mediterranean Sea. It reportedly
carried surveillance equipment to monitor Israel's Arab enemies.
   The silver craft was set aloft south of Tel Aviv, where
witnesses saw it arch and watched as booster rockets disengaged and
fell to the sea. The launching made Israel the eighth country known
to possess a rocket powerful enough to put a satellite into space.
   A spokesman for Jane's Defense Weekly, the London-based defense
magazine, said the Israeli satellite was believed to be ``carrying
a 3-kilogram (1.2-pound) payload for surveillance purposes,''
apparently for monitoring activity in Arab countries.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres discounted fears that the
launching would spur an arms race with its Arab enemies.
   ``It's not an arms race,'' Peres said on Israel radio. ``The
Arabs bought missiles and produce missiles and will do anything
they can anyway.''
   Tony Banks, a reporter for Jane's who is known to have close
ties to Israeli military sources, said Israel was not thought to
have the capability to install its own sophisticated surveillance
equipment in a satellite.
   ``U.S. optical equipment is assumed to have been used in the
payload,'' Banks told The Associated Press in London.
   Foreign reports said earlier that the satellite was a test craft
that would precede the launching of a spy satellite.
   Yuval Neeman, head of Israel's space agency, described the
launching as ``all in all, very clean work.''
   He called the craft a ``technological satellite'' but
acknowledged: ``There's military potential in all this activity.''
   Meir Amit, former head of Israel's Mossad secret service and
current chief of Israel's General Satellite Corp., said the
launching could give Israel independent access to satellite
pictures currently provided by the U.S. government.
   ``If you ... are fed from the crumbs of others according to
their moods, this is very inconvenient and very difficult,'' Amit
said on Israel radio. ``If you have your own, independent
capability, you climb one level higher.''
   Neeman said the satellite, launched shortly before noon, ``rose
to a height of about 250 kilometers (155 miles). That will be its
closest point to Earth. It will reach a distance of about 1,000
kilometers (620 miles).''
   ``It will revolve around the Earth in about an hour and a
half,'' Neeman said on Israel radio. ``The satellite will fly for
about a month. Afterward, it will burn up.''
   The other countries known to possess the technology to launch a
satellite are the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Japan,
France, Britain and India.
   
   The launching came a day after Israel's 10-member inner Cabinet
approved the mission, according to Israeli media reports.
   Plans to launch an experimental satellite surfaced Sunday in the
Israeli media, which quoted reports in the British weekly Flight
International and Time magazine as saying the test craft would
precede putting a spy satellite in orbit.
   Israeli leaders refused to comment on those reports.
   The Israeli daily Haaretz quoted experts as saying the odds were
high that something would go wrong during Israel's first attempt to
launch a satellite.
   Unidentified defense experts told the Hadashot daily Sunday that
a spy satellite would provide faster and more accurate information
about enemy military movements on the ground and save money by
reducing the number of reconnaissance flights.
   But Gerald Steinberg, a former U.S. space expert now living in
Israel, told the Jerusalem Post a single spy satellite would be
``almost meaningless'' in helping to defend Israel.
   An entire system of satellites costing about $10 billion would
be needed to make a serious contribution, the Post quoted Steinberg
as saying.
   Until now, Israel has relied on reconnaissance aircraft and
pilotless drones for intelligence-gathering.
   Work on the Israeli satellite started in 1983, when Israel's
space agency was created. The carrier rocket was built jointly by
the Rafael weapons development authority and space aircraft
industries.
   According to foreign reports, Israel secretly fired a
medium-range missile over the Mediterranean last May in preparation
for launching a spy satellite.
   Israel has limited access to U.S. space satellite information.
But some Israeli leaders have made no secret of their
dissatisfaction with this arrangement.
   ``The relations between the United States and Israel, when it
comes to this, are those of a patron and his dependent,'' former
army intelligence chief Yehoshua Saguy told Hadashot.

   A provincewide strike by
27,000 civil service workers closed most government offices today.
Some 1,500 prison guards who joined the strike Saturday agreed to
return today under court order.
   The guards, members of the British Columbia Government Employees
Union, are among about 2,000 workers whose services were designated
essential.
   Officials said most government offices would be closed today,
including land titles offices and registries for births, deaths and
marriages.
   The union, whose contract expired July 31, struck after a
39-hour negotiating session failed to resolve the issue of wages.
The walkout Saturday stalled six inland ferries and affected the
government's 216 liquor stores.
   The guards walked out at many of the 33 provincial correctional
facilities Saturday, creating a situation government negotiator Bob
Plecas called ``tense and explosive.''
   Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers were brought in to handle
security, and inmates were locked in their cells at a Vancouver
prison. There were also reports of fights at a juvenile facility in
Burnaby.
   Late Sunday, British Columbia Supreme Court Justice Bruce Cohen
ordered guards back on the job.
   ``It looks like all of our corrections members will be going
back to work in compliance with the court order,'' said union
spokeswoman Sheila Fruman. ``Some won't be back until the morning
shift change. But they will be going back.''
   The last wage demands made public by the union totaled 25
percent over three years. Plecas said the government offered 5
percent in each year of a three-year contract. Ms. Fruman said the
guards earn about $15 an hour.

   Beulah Mae Donald, who won a $7 million
judgment against the Ku Klux Klan for the beating death of her son,
was remembered by the attorney who handled the case as a ``brave
and courageous mother.''
   Mrs. Donald died of natural causes Saturday at a Mobile
hospital. She was 67.
   ``She'll forever have a place in history as the woman who beat
the Klan,'' said Morris Dees, who was the chief attorney for the
black family.
   Mrs. Donald's son, Michael, was strangled and fatally beaten in
Baldwin County and his body was found hanged from a tree in a
Mobile neighborhood. Two Ku Klux Klansmen were convicted in the
case.
   On Feb. 12, 1987, a jury awarded the family a $7 million
judgment against the Klan.
   The United Klans of America's national headquarters building in
Tuscaloosa, its only asset, was later signed over to the estate of
Michael Donald and sold for an undisclosed sum. It had been
appraised at between $150,000 and $200,000.
   ``I just think she was a brave and courageous mother whose love
for her son ensured that he did not die in vain,'' said Dees,
director of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery.
   Last December, Mrs. Donald was named one of Ms. Magazine's 1987
Women of the Year.
   Shortly after receiving the honor, Mrs. Donald said she never
sought revenge.
   ``I wanted to know who all really killed my child,'' she said.
``I wasn't even thinking about the money. If I hadn't gotten a
cent, it wouldn't have mattered. I wanted to know how and why they
did it.''
   He 19-year-old son was kidnapped from a Mobile street in March
1981 and taken to a rural area where he was beaten and choked. His
throat was cut and his body was hanged from a tree.
   Klansmen Henry Francis Hays has been sentenced to die in
Alabama's electric chair and James L. ``Tiger'' Knowles is serving
a life sentence in a federal prison. He pleaded guilty to violating
Donald's civil rights.
   The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear Hays' appeal of his
capital murder conviction in February.
   In February, a mistrial was declared in the trial of two alleged
accomplices, Bennie Jack Hays and Benjamin Franklin Cox, after the
former collapsed in court.
   Mrs. Donald survivors include four daughters: Mary A. Houston of
Jackson, Miss.; Cecelia Perry; Cynthia Mitchell; and Betty J.
Wyatt, all of Mobile; and two sons, Stanley Donald of Biloxi,
Miss.; and Leo Donald of Detroit, Mich.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

   Thousands of mourners surrounded the coffin
containing five Torahs destroyed in a synagogue arson fire, and
police have charged two youths with setting the blaze and
spray-painting swastikas inside the temple.
   Speakers at Sunday's funeral ceremony, which was attended by
10,000 people, compared the vandalism to Kristalnacht, the ``night
of the broken glass'' in Nazi Germany that signaled the beginning
of the Holocaust 50 years ago this November.
   ``How?'' asked Rabbi Hillel David, whose Orthodox Congregation
Rabbinical Institute Sharai Torah in Brooklyn was heavily damaged
in the blaze early Saturday, the Sabbath between the holiest days
on the Jewish calendar _ Rosh Hashana, new year, and Yom Kippur,
the day of repentance that begins at sundown Tuesday.
   ``How can such a thing be that the holy Torah is destroyed by
fire? A fire from men, from haters of the Torah?''
   ``The whole life is a life of tests. But I do not know what this
test is.'' The Torah, the scroll containing the first five books of
the Old Testament, are so holy that by Jewish law they are accorded
a funeral.
   After the 90-minute service, the coffin was carried through the
crowd to a waiting station wagon. It was buried at a Jewish
cemetery in Deans, N.J.
   During the funeral, Mayor Edward I. Koch was applauded when he
said the youths arrested ``have to be assailed and have to be
punished,'' despite their age, 12 and 15.
   The boys were charged Sunday as juveniles with arson, burglary
and criminal mischief, said Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell, a police
spokesman.
   The 12-year-old was accompanied by his mother when he
surrendered late Saturday.
   ``She was very distraught about it so she called the police,''
said Detective Sgt. Willie Shaw. ``That was our link to the
15-year-old.''
   The older boy was arrested at his home early Sunday, police
said. They were released to their parents' custody pending an
appearance in Family Court at an undisclosed time.
   Neither of the boys, who live near the synagogue, is Jewish,
said Officer Hugh Barry, another police spokesman.
   The youths entered the 300-member synagogue shortly after
midnight and removed the scrolls, Judaism's holiest objects, from
the ark where they are kept, and rolled them across the floor
before setting them afire, police said.
   Each scroll could cost up to $50,000 to replace, said City
Councilman Noach Dear, who is Jewish and represents the
neighborhood, which is mostly Jewish, with some Hispanics and
whites of Irish and Italian ancestry.
   Justin Finger, associate national director of the B'nai B'rith's
Anti Defamation League, called the desecration ``extraordinary.''
   ``I have never heard of any desecration in the United States in
recent years where that number of Torahs was destroyed,'' he said.
   ``These barbaric atrocities are properly associated with Nazi
Germany,'' said U.S. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, evoking a
comparison that was used by virtually everyone who commented on the
attack.
   As the plain pine coffin was carried through the crowd, mourners
reached to touch it.
   ``Look, look and remember,'' a father holding up his young son
said in Yiddish.

   American allegations that Iraq is using
outlawed chemical weapons against Kurdish rebels have touched off a
wave of anti-Americanism in Iraq.
   But although the conflict may damage U.S.-Iraqi relations, there
appears little likelihood of a return to the bitter hostility that
made Iraq a leading foe of U.S. Middle East policies in the 1970s.
   The U.S. Senate on Sept. 9 accused Iraq of using poison gas in a
campaign of ``genocide'' against its autonomy-seeking Kurdish
minority.
   The State Department said it had proof of Iraqi poison gas
attacks, based on American examination of Kurdish refugees in
Turkey. Britain also condemned Baghdad, citing ``compelling
evidence'' provided by Washington.
   The Senate demanded economic sanctions against Iraq, which is
struggling to cope with a foreign debt estimated at $70 billion
incurred during its 8-year war with Iran.
   Iraq denies the gas allegations and has responded with a wave of
fierce anti-American rhetoric. Its state-controlled newspapers and
broadcasts have branded the Senate the ``American Knesset,'' a
reference to Israel's parliament, and claimed it seeks to help
Israel by weakening a powerful Arab country.
   The Iraqis organized a march by 20,000 people past the U.S.
Embassy. Many chanted slogans in English denouncing alleged
American human rights abuses.
   Questioning America's right to preach, Iraqi television screened
an hour-long documentary depicting the 1945 atomic bombing of
Hiroshima.
   It also showed Vietnamese children with napalm burns and
Palestinian victims of Israeli attacks as well as film of rats
crawling over homeless Americans sleeping in New York City sewers.
   The anti-American propaganda is the strongest since the United
States and Iraq resumed diplomatic ties in 1984 after a 17-year
break caused by U.S. support of Israel in the 1967 war with the
Arabs.
   Today, Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz said future relations with
Washington depend on whether the U.S. adminstration agrees to the
Senate calls for sanctions against Iraq.
   ``If the American adminstration yields to the campaign of the
Senate and the Zionist lobby, this will have negative effect on
relations between the two countries,'' Aziz told reporters in
Baghdad.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Nizar Hamdoon told The Associated Press
last week that Iraq's response did not indicate any shift in its
basic orientation.
   But, he added, ``If the (U.S.) policy continues, if the tension
continues, obviously trade opportunities and other matters ...
would be in jeopardy.''
   Diplomats in Baghdad said they expected the burst of rhetoric to
pass if the chemical weapons charges do not continue.
   Iraq badly needs Western, if not American, credit to help
rebuild its war-battered country and reward its weary population
with consumer goods.
   It also seeks diplomatic support in its negotiating struggles
with Iran at peace talks in Geneva.
   U.S. relations with Iraq improved gradually during the Persian
Gulf war, aided by Iraq's growing ties with pro-Western states in
the region and U.S. hostility toward Iran's Islamic fundamentalist
government.
   Iraq also appreciated U.S. naval intervention in the gulf to
protect its Arab neighbors' shipping from Iranian attacks.
   But the Iraqis remain deeply suspicious of the United States and
sensitive about signs that foreign countries are tilting toward
Iran in the postwar era.
   Iran's size, oil wealth and position on the southern Soviet
flank have made it a focus of Western diplomacy for decades, and
Tehran's more pragmatic leaders are seeking to end the country's
self-imposed isolation.
   But Iraq, too, is a strategic country. Its oil reserves are
second only to those of Saudi Arabia, it flanks NATO member Turkey
and it is argued that Iraq's war with Iran blocked the expansion of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's Islamic crusade.
   Iraqi leaders claim the Western allegations of chemical warfare
are designed to help both Israel and Iran.
   Their suspicions are rooted partly in Israeli and American
efforts to aid Iran during the war and by strong U.S.
identification with Israel, which regards Iraq, with a
million-strong battle-hardened army, as a major potential threat.
   Israel bombed an Iraqi nuclear plant in June 1981 to prevent the
possible development of an Arab atomic bomb.
   Baghdad expressed skepticism about the timing of U.S. actions.
During the war with Iran, Iraq said it used chemical weapons after
Iran used them first. Iraq drew United Natons condemnation, but no
sanctions.
   Both Turkey and the Red Cross say they have been unable to
substantiate the gas charges that drew the latest U.S. criticism.
   And diplomats critical of Iraq's treatment of the Kurds refuse,
even in private, to characterize it as genocide.
   They said the Iraqis, who lost hundreds of thousands of
casualties to conventional arms in the war, have trouble
understanding the West's reaction to chemical warfare charges.
   The crisis has rallied Arabs behind Iraq. Kuwait's Foreign
Ministry on Wednesday summoned U.S. Ambassador Nathaniel Wilson
Howell to express ``extreme concern'' over the U.S. charges, an
official statement said.
   It reported that Foreign undersecretary Suleiman Majed
Al-Shaheen told Howell: ``Kuwait regrets the way the American media
exploited such allegations to launch a campaign against Iraq at a
time when neutral parties ... announced they did not find evidence
that Iraq has used chemical weapons.''
   It added that Kuwait ``believes that invoking such questions by
the U.S. Senate will only ... undermine the chances of concluding a
comprehensive peace agreement'' between Iran and Iraq.

   The gender gap has not faded away as a crucial
factor in the 1988 presidential campaign, it has just changed
camps. The problem now is stalking Democrat Michael Dukakis.
   While recent surveys show that Bush has erased a double-digit
deficit and drawn even with Dukakis among women voters, those
surveys also indicate deteriorating support for the Massachusetts
Democrat among men.
   The polls show that Dukakis' unfavorable ratings among men are
now much larger than Bush's unfavorable ratings among women.
   ``If George Bush continues to run even with women, then he wins
the election big and at the moment, he is doing extraordinarily
well,'' said Republican consultant Doug Bailey.
   ``The gender gap right now is a much bigger problem for Dukakis
than for Bush,'' he continued.
   Bailey as recently as last July 7 said at a news conference
sponsored by the National Federation of Business and Professional
Women's Clubs that ``if he (Bush) doesn't bridge the gender gap, he
will not win.''
   Now, that's all changed and Bush ``has solved the gender gap
problem, although he has not closed it completely,'' Bailey said.
   Gender gap is the term politicians use to describe the
differences between the way men and women vote. It was evident in
the 1980 election, when President Reagan won far more support among
male voters than among female voters, according to polls. The trend
repeated itself, although to a lesser degree, in Reagan's 1984
landslide re-election.
   A New York Times-CBS poll released last week showed that among
men, Bush held a commanding 53 percent to 37 percent lead; while
among women he held a 43-41 percent lead, which statistically is a
dead heat.
   That's a far cry from just a few months ago, when Bush trailed
Dukakis among women voters by more than 20 points and was even with
Dukakis among male voters. Furthermore, a poll in July by Hamilton,
Frederick and Schneiders showed that working women then preferred
Dukakis by a 2-to-1 margin.
   Irene Natividad, chair of the National Women's Political Caucus
and a former harsh critic of Bush's sensitivity to women's issues,
said the narrowing of the gender gap directly reflects positive
steps that Bush and his campaign strategists have taken to court
the women's vote.
   ``Whether it's political expediency or real commitment doesn't
really matter,'' she said. ``When you have child care as part of
the political dialogue along with foreign policy, then I think all
women win. This is the first time we've had such a thing happen.''
   Ms. Natividad said Dukakis needs to do more to stress his own
commitment to issues deemed important by women _ or risk seeing his
remaining 50 percent female support erode further.
   Bush's recent emphasis on his family, on the environment, his
``kinder, gentler nation'' acceptance speech, his proposal for a
$1,000 child-care tax credit, calls for an increase in the minimum
wage and for a parental leave program, all have helped him build
support among women voters, analysts say.
   Also helping have been his hiring of women for several key
campaign roles and his emphasis on peace as well as economic
issues, these analysts add.
   ``I'm not bright enough to figure out which of these is the most
important. But, collectively, they have worked,'' said consultant
Bailey. ``Also, the fact that he's now viewed as a stronger
personna has also helped.''
   Norman Ornstein, an analyst at the American Enterprise
Institute, said that ``it's not so much that women have turned
against Michael Dukakis. Where he had support it was mostly weak
support. We continue to have a gender gap, but it has closed some
and it has meant less because Bush's lead has widened among men.''
   On Dukakis' lack of strength among male voters, Bob Beckel, who
managed Walter Mondale's 1984 campaign, said, ``Democratic nominees
have had serious troubles with white men for some time now. I think
Dukakis is suffering from that.''
   ``As much as Bush needs to get the gender gap down with women,
the Democrats cannot afford to lose by those big margins among
men,'' Beckel said.
   Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., has a slightly different view on why
the gender gap is closing for Bush.
   ``Women take longer to make up their minds,'' she said.
   ``But now they've heard George Bush on issues that matter. For
the first time, people are seeing the George Bush that his friends
talk about.''

``sweet spots,'' not one, and that loose rather than taut strings
will yield more cross-court winners.
   Howard Brody, a University of Pennsylvania professor and weekly
tennis player, has spent thousands of hours over the last decade
using lasers, oscilloscopes and other scientific instruments to
understand how rackets work.
   Brody found more than one ``sweet spot'' _ the place on the
strings where it feels good to hit the ball.
   One spot is where there is the least initial shock to the hand;
the second is where uncomfortable vibrations to the hand and arm
are smallest, and the third is the where the ball bounces off the
strings with the greatest power.
   Contrary to popular belief, tighter strings mean less, not more,
power, Brody said. He said he also discovered that stiffer rackets
give more power than more flexible ones.
   Brody, who has written two books on the science of tennis, said
that the biggest breakthroughs in tennis technology will come in
improved strings. He also foresees rackets made with cushioned
grips that reduce vibrations.
   ``If I had spent as much time on the courts as I've spent in the
lab, I'd be a great player,'' Brody said.

   Two northern California brush fires
scorched 14,000 acres, destroying 24 structures and forcing at
least 350 people to flee, but frosty weather in Montana and Wyoming
helped ease blazes there.
   About 100 homes were threatened by the wind-fanned fires that
began late Saturday 15 miles west of Vacaville and 20 miles east of
Redding. The Vacaville fire was arson, and caused more than $7
million in damage to telecommunications equipment, officials said.
   In Wyoming, a cold front Sunday brought up to 3 inches of snow
to the fire-charred Yellowstone National Park.
   ``I would be surprised if the fires made any more major runs,''
said fire specialist Bruce Freet. But officials weren't ready to
predict the end of the blazes that have involved about half of
Yellowstone's 2.2 million acres.
   Meanwhile, some soldiers who fought Yellowstone fires were upset
at the disparity between Army pay and that for civilian
firefighters. Base pay for a private is $671 per month, but some
civilian firefighters were making as much as $3,700 per month, said
1st Lt. Bob Brewer, spokesman for the 9th Infantry Division.
   ``There's a lot of screaming about pay,'' Brewer said.
   In Montana, the winter weather quieted the two remaining major
forest fires and prompted the release of most of the firefighters
and soldiers who helped battle the blazes. The firefighters on the
lines focused on the 35,400-acre fire in Glacier National Park and
the smouldering 247,000-acre fire in west-central Montana.
   In California, some 1,500 firefighters were dispatched to fight
the out-of-control blazes near Vacaville, 55 miles northeast of San
Francisco, and near Redding, about 250 miles northeast of the San
Francisco Bay area.
   Nine homes and three outbuildings burned to the ground in the
10,000-acre fire near Vacaville on Sunday, while 12 buildings,
including six homes, were destroyed by a 4,200-acre blaze near
Redding. Fire officials gave no estimate of damage.
   Evacuees began returning home Sunday night as dying winds helped
firefighters. Lines had been built around 70 percent of the blaze
this morning, California Department of Forestry spokesman John Teie
said.
   Up to 285 people from communities in eastern Shasta County were
evacuated as firefighters battled the Redding blaze, which was
fueled by dry timber and 45 mph gusts, said Evelyn Dollarhide, a
spokeswoman with the California Department of Forestry.
   The evacuees included 85 students and counselors from the
Cascade School, a boarding school, said Dollarhide.
   More than 800 firefighters fought the blaze, which began about
midnight Saturday, officials said.
   ``It's really awful to walk up and see your place burn,'' said
Andrew Scott, who spent the night with about 100 others at a Red
Cross evacuation center near Redding. His home was destroyed by
rapidly moving flames early Sunday.
   The family also lost three dogs, a mobile home and three
vehicles in the blaze.
   ``We got up there and we didn't have nothing,'' said Margie
Scott, Andrew's wife, after visiting the rubble that had been their
home.
   In Miller Canyon near Vacaville, almost 700 firefighters battled
the fire that broke out Saturday night and forced 65 people from
their homes.
   The blaze was one of four in the area that had been set, fire
officials.
   ``I believe the assumption now is the same person may have
started all of them,'' said forestry spokesman John Ferreira.
   About 50 other ranch homes scattered throughout the region were
threatened, said forestry official, Dianne Sanders.
   Firefighters expected to contain the fire tonight, unless
erratic winds kicked up, said Ferreira.
   Atop Mount Vca, several towers used for military, telephone and
television communications were damaged by the fire, he said. The
damage was estimated at $7 million.
   Elsewhere, about 550 firefighters on Sunday hacked lines around
an 850-acre fire in north-central Idaho's Gospel Hump Wilderness,
while special ``hot shot'' crews headed to battle the 800-acre fire
in the Boise National Forest.

   Warring gang members fired shots and went on a
club-wielding rampage at an outdoor Latin music festival, and two
people were shot, police said.
   About 20 bystanders and a police officer also were injured in
the melee Sunday, which took 100 police officers more than three
hours to quell, police said. Police estimated at least 50 people
were arrested.
   ``I'm trembling _ I'm in pure fear,'' said Mayda Ramirez, one of
at least 5,000 visitors at the Central American Independence Day
Festival in Tropical Park.
   The violence began when someone fired a gun into the crowd and
hit a young man in the shoulder, police said. ``It appears to be
some gang-related activities that got out of control very
quickly,'' said Metro Police Chief Fred Taylor.
   Bottles flew, and young men carrying sticks moved through the
crowds, sending spectators into a mad dash.
   ``You would just be standing there, and they'd come up and hit
you,'' said Dawn Santiago, who ducked into a lemonade stand for
cover. ``We just ran in, there was no time to think.''
   For more than three hours the youths played cat-and-mouse with
officers, who ran down and tackled many of the young men.
   A man with a gunshot wound in the chest and another who was shot
in the buttocks were in stable condition at Baptist Hospital, said
emergency room nurse Jose Segarre.
   A police officer and a concert-goer who were hit in the head
with bottles and two women who suffered heat exhaustion were also
treated at the hospital.

   China said today its troops fired only warning
shots to keep a British helicopter away from a disputed island in
the South China Sea.
   A Foreign Ministry statement denied British press reports that
the Chinese troops fired at the Royal Navy helicopter, and called
the incident ``entirely a misunderstanding.''
   The British Embassy said Thursday that the helicopter was
searching for a sinking Taiwanese trawler in the South China Sea on
Aug. 23 when it was hit by gunfire from a Chinese garrison on the
Paracel Islands. The Paracels, a chain of islands in the South
China Sea, are claimed by China and Vietnam. China seized the
islands from South Vietnam in 1974.
   The embassy said the helicopter, based on the British frigate
Sirius, was nicked but not significantly damaged and no one was
injured.
   The Foreign Ministry at first refused to confirm or deny that
Chinese troops fired, saying only that media reports were incorrect
and the incident was closed.
   But in today's statement, China said the helicopter ``went
beyond the originally designated flying range and flew at low
altitude over China's Zhongjian island (in the Paracels).''
   ``Under such circumstances, our troops stationed there fired
warning shots,'' the statement said. ``This was entirely a
misunderstanding. Now this matter has been resolved.''

   Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis is in excellent
health except for an occasional backache, his doctor said today.
   A medical statement was issued by Dr. Gerald Plotkin as Dukakis
flew to Little Rock, Ark., and Houston for campaign appearances.
Plotkin said campaign travel made Dukakis' back pain worsen.
   Dukakis had a routine medical checkup Sept. 10 at the Harvard
Community Health Plan's Wellesley Center and ``was found to be in
excellent health,'' Plotkin said.
   ``Over the last eight to 10 months he has had intermittent,
nagging low back discomfort exacerbated by long periods of sitting
in airplanes,'' the doctor said.
   He said Dukakis takes an anti-inflammatory medication to ease
the back pain.
   On Aug. 3, the candidate's longtime doctor issued a detailed,
three-page statement which said Dukakis had only received treatment
for routine ailments, such as hay fever and muscle sprains, and
``has had no psychological symptoms, complaints or treatment.''
   ``He has had no significant illnesses during his lifetime and
has been in excellent health,'' Plotkin said then. ``He has never
appeared depressed to me.''

   The government has set up a toll-free
telephone number and an office in the Justice Department for anyone
inquiring about restitution payments to people of Japanese ancestry
interned by U.S. authorities in camps during World War II.
   The toll-free phone number is 1-800-228-8375, the Justice
Department announced today. In the Washington area, the number is
835-2094. Calls will be received from 8:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.
Eastern time, Monday through Friday.
   Letters should be mailed to the newly established Office of
Reparations Administration, P.O. Box 66260, Washington, D.C.
20035-6260.
   The Office of Reparations Administration in the department's
civil rights division will be responsibile for identifying those
who are eligible for the restitution and for making the payments.
   The restitution was authorized in the recently enacted Civil
Liberties Act of 1988.
   The Justice Department, meanwhile, is developing regulations for
determining eligibility for the payments, said William Bradford
Reynolds, head of the Justice Department's civil rights division.
   The Office of Reparations Administration will be headed by
Robert Bratt, head of the executive office of the civil rights
division.

   A man was convicted of murder and sentenced
to five to 10 years in prison today for shooting a teen-ager who
was throwing snowballs at his house.
   Judge Eugene H. Clarke Jr. also found Edward Smith, 49, guilty
of weapons possession and recklessly endangering in the 1987
slaying of Peter McGettigan, 16. The judge announced his verdict
after a non-jury trial last week.
   McGettigan died of a gunshot through the spine. Smith testified
that he fired twice to scare off a group of teen-agers who had been
taunting his family and throwing snowballs. He said he had no
intention of killing anyone.
   Smith received the mandatory minimum term for third-degree
murder. He could receive up to seven more years when sentenced on
the other charges Nov. 29.

<TEXT>
   Voters in a small farming community
rebelled against Sweden's generous refugee policy and
overwhelmingly rejected a government request to accept a few dozen
immigrants.
   Sunday's local referendum in the southern district of Sjobo was
closely watched by a nation anxious that a negative vote could be
seen as the surfacing of supressed racism. The referendum was a
part of nationwide elections.
   The result came as a surprise, with two out of three voters
saying ``no'' to a proposal to take in the refugees. The TT news
agency reported 6,237 people voted against housing the immigrants
and 3,000 voting in favor of the proposal.
   It was the first time Swedes openly defied their country's
long-standing policy to provide sanctuary to political refugees, as
well as language training, job skills, housing, education and
generous social benefits.
   ``This is a sad result. Everyone is a loser,'' said Madeleine
Ramel, head of the social welfare board that would have taken care
of the immigrants. ``It is unfortunate for Sjobo.''
   Mrs. Ramel said she feared the referendum results would prompt
other communities to reassess their policy of accepting immigrants.
   The agency said the voting was quiet, but some opponents of the
proposal carried placards for ``A white Sjobo,'' and ``Sjobo: a
Swedish example.''
   Last year 18,000 people _ the highest rate in Europe _ sought
political asylum in Sweden, a neutral nation of 8.4 million,
according to government figures.
   In an effort to relocate the immigrants outside the main cities,
authorities sent letters to 284 municipal districts asking their
help.
   The letter to Sjobo did not specify how many refugees the town
would be asked to shelter or give their national origin, but local
officials said the number would have been between 20 and 40.
   The Sjobo town council split on the issue last fall and voted
25-24 to put the question to a referendum.
   Council chairman Sven-Olle Olsson, head of the Center Party and
leader of the fight to keep the immigrants out, argued the farming
community lacked apartments and jobs to keep its own young people
from moving to the cities.
   On Sunday, Olsson also won a clear endorsement for himself when
his party won 23 seats on the 49-member council, eight more than it
previously held.
   Olof Johansson, national leader of the Center Party, expressed
``deep regret'' at the outcome and indicated Olsson and other local
activists would be expelled from the party.
   ``But Sjobo is special. It is not (like) all of Sweden, thank
God,'' Johansson said.
   Until now, Sweden has not seen the right-wing backlash to
immigration that has affected countries like France and Denmark.
   Analysts attributed the quiet acceptance of foreigners to a
labor shortage and plentiful jobs, and to a tradition of humanism
that was reflected in Sweden's efforts to rescue Jews from Nazi
Germany in World War II.
   But hostility toward newcomers has been evident under the
surface and has occasionally erupted into minor incidents.
   ``A lot of Swedes have a negative attitude toward immigrants. It
is normally surpressed, but having a referendum is bringing it to
the surface,'' said political scientist Anders Sonnerstedt of Lund
University.

   A.J. ``Curly'' Weil is a 72-year-old cowboy
who's making a dream come true on the wagon train along the Trail
of Tears, the route taken by Cherokee Indians driven from their
land in the Southeast 150 years ago.
   ``I've always wanted to go on a wagon train trip across the
country and now I'm doing it,'' the crusty Grayville, Ill., retiree
said Sunday night as he unhitched his four-horse team from the
covered wagon he built this summer.
   Weil put his wagon and horses on a ferry and crossed the
Tennessee River to Georgetown this morning, the third day of the
Trail of Tears Commemorative Wagon Train's journey to Tahlequah,
Okla. The journey began in Cleveland, Tenn.
   ``I've got a niece who married an Indian whose great-grandmother
was forced to make this trip back in 1838, when she was just 14,''
Weill said. ``She made it to Oklahoma and lived to be 94.''
   A total of 13,000 Cherokees were forced to give up their land in
the Southeast and resettle in Tahlequah, Okla., a 1,000-mile march
that claimed about 4,000 Indian lives.
   The wagon train train is expected to average 16 miles a day as
it follows the winding route that the Cherokees took as they walked
through Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas and
Oklahoma.
   ``It's not going to be easy, taking a wagon train 1,000 miles,
but I think we can make it,'' said Weil, whose 16-foot wagon was
one of nine camped in a field a mile east of the river Sunday night.
   ``That's three more than we had when we started on Saturday,''
Weil said. ``We'll keep picking up wagons all along the way. It's
hard to tell how many we'll have when we get to Oklahoma.''
   He added, ``My horses ain't broke too good at this point, but
they will before the end of the week.''
   A former oil field construction worker, Weil knows all about
breaking horses and mules.
   ``I've been riding horses all my life,'' he said. ``My dad
homesteaded in western Kansas and I was breaking horses and mules
when I was just a sprout.''
   ``Those were the days,'' he said. ``Now I'm an old man and this
is my last big ride. I'm going to make the most of it. I'm going to
take my wagon across the country.
   ``I'm doing it for all those Cherokee Indians who were forced to
make this trip 150 years ago; I'm doing it for my dad and, the
truth is, I'm doing it for myself.''

<HEAD>Gibraltar Police Say Warnings Shouted Before Shooting IRA
Activists</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Gibraltar policeman testified today he heard
British commandos shout ``Stop! Police!'' before shooting to death
two Irish Republican Army members in this British colony.
   A third IRA guerrilla who was a short distance away also was
shot and killed in the March 6 incident.
   The police officer's statement supported earlier testimony by
Special Air Service commandos that they ``had no alternative but to
shoot'' Mairead Farrell, Daniel McCann and Sean Savage last March
on a Gibraltar street.
   The officer's testimony came on the 10th day of an inquest by
Gibraltar Coroner Felix Pizzarello and an 11-man jury into the
shootings of the three unarmed IRA members.
   Critics of the government of British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher have claimed the shootings proves there is an unofficial
``shoot-to-kill'' policy against IRA members. The outlawed IRA
seeks to drive the British from Northern Ireland and unify the
province with the Irish Republic.
   The commandos and British intelligence officers have testified
they believed the three IRA guerrillas possessed a radio-control
device capable of setting off a bomb in a car they had parked near
the site of a changing- of-the-guard ceremony.
   The commandos pumped more than two dozen bullets into the heads
and backs of the three. The commandos testified they had planned to
arrest the three but opened fire when Ms. Farrell and McCann made
threatening movements. Savage was walking nearby.
   Shooting for the head was the only way to eliminate the
possibility one of the three would push a button to set off a bomb,
the commandos said.
   Police found no radio-control device and no bomb in the car
parked by Savage in Gibraltar, although the IRA said the three were
members on active service.
   Two days later police discovered a car packed with 141 pounds of
Czech-made explosives in the coastal resort of Marbella.
   Intelligence officials said the bomb was to be activated by two
electronic timers. They speculated the IRA members parked the first
car in Gibraltar to save a parking space for the car carrying the
explosives.
   The Gibraltar police officer, identified only as ``P,''
testified from behind a curtain that hid him from the public and
the press. He said he was on surveillance near the spot where the
IRA members were killed when he saw two of them approaching,
followed by two commandos.
   ``I distinctly heard a shout of `Stop! Police,' from the
soldiers,'' the officer said.
   He said McCann's hand went to his chest and Ms. Farrell reached
inside the black shoulder bag she was carrying. At that point, the
two commandos opened fire, the officer said.
   The officer said he thought McCann was reaching for a gun and
that Ms. Farrell ``was going for the detonator.''
   ``So the soldiers had no alternative but to shoot,'' said the
commandos' lawyer, Michael Hucker.
   ``Yes, sir,'' the officer responded.

   Professional singers gathered in a tiny funeral
chapel in Harlem for a memorial for one of their own, a 44-year-old
basso whose life was music but who was killed while moonlighting as
a cab driver.
   Leslie Dorsey was shot by robbers who stole his money and papers
on Labor Day. Police listed him as a gypsy cab driver with a
tentative identification and it was nearly a week before his family
learned he had been killed.
   He was driving a cab while awaiting scheduled performances in
the chorus of seven New York City Opera productions this season.
   Friends from his childhood, classmates from the old High School
of Music and Art and singers with whom he performed over the years
attended the memorial service Saturday. Some sang favorite songs of
Dorsey's, others reminisced.
   While he did not get enough work to make a living from singing,
Dorsey was a respected performer with nearly perfect pitch and
music was the mainstay of his life, his friends said.
   ``Leslie was always encouraging the rest of us singers to keep
on auditioning and never give up,'' said Janet Jordan, who appeared
with Dorsey in a European tour of ``Porgy and Bess'' in l976.
   Dorsey performed in opera, pop, jazz and rhythm and blues. With
the City Opera he was an associate chorister, a pool of singers
that augments the regular chorus.
   He toured for a year with Judy Collins in 1979 and also worked
with Roberta Flack.
   ``You get a performance, and after the performance you get
temporary work,'' said Barbara Mahajan, an opera singer and part
time church secretary. ``Leslie worked very hard, and he was making
very little money in order to do what he believed in.''
   Dorsey was divorced. He had three children two in college and
one still in junior high.

   Republican George Bush today accused
Michael Dukakis today of pursuing an ``anti-business scheme'' as
Massachusetts governor that has produced higher taxes and soaring
business bankruptcies.
   The vice president told the Bucks County Chamber of Commerce
that his Democratic presidential rival this year ``raised all sorts
of taxes: the income tax, the sales tax and one that might be of
special interest to this audience.''
   That one, he said, involved a cutback in a ``Subchapter S'' tax
law that had the effect of doubling taxes on Massachusetts
businesses employing fewer than 35 people.
   ``A question of attitude,'' Bush said. ``It is here that I think
my opponent fails. Frankly, since he's never been in business, I
don't think he understands the full effect of his own anti-business
scheme.''
   Continuing several days of attacks on Dukakis' home-state
economic record, Bush said the governor is ``out of the
mainstream'' of Democrats by opposing a reduction in the capital
gains tax.
   ``Here is the most telling statistic of all for what a Dukakis
administration might mean for small business,'' Bush said. ``In the
first six months of this year, the number of business bankruptcies
nationally was down by 23.5 percent compared to the same period
last year. In the exact same period, the number of business
bankruptcies was up by 23.7 percent in Massachusetts.''
   Bush said he wants to help small business with overhaul of
product liability laws to keep insurance costs down.
   The vice president also said that between 1980 and 1985 the
number of businesses owned by women increased by nearly 50 percent.
   Bush said 5 million new businesses have been created while
inflation and interest rates have fallen during the eight years of
the Reagan presidency, and that small business firms' earnings rose
9.9 percent in 1987.
   The vice president's planned visit today with Roman Catholic
Archbishop Anthony Bevilaqua and retired Cardinal John Krol was
postponed because of foggy weather that prevented the campaign
plane from landing in Philadelphia.
   Bush planned a light schedule of campaign appearances this week
to give himself time to prepare for his first campaign debate with
Dukakis on Sunday.
   On Tuesday he travels to New Jersey to visit the Annin flag
company, a business he has cited in speeches as a sign that
patriotism has been on the rise during the Reagan presidency. Bush
says flag sales were down when Jimmy Carter was president, but that
after Reagan's election, business was booming again.
   Later in the week, Bush plans a brief campaign trip to Texas.
   As he prepares for the Sunday debate at Wake Forest University
in North Carolina, Bush told reporters he is ``not too good on
these statistics'' and needs briefing time to familiarize himself
with statistical information on various topics that likely will
come up.
   Bush and his team have not been hesitant to mention often that
Dukakis is a debating expert and should be expected to perform well.
   Bush said last week that he isn't nervous about going up against
Dukakis, ``but I'd like to do well.''
   ``He's better than I am'' on technical style, Bush said, adding,
``So I've got to do something else.''
   He said he hoped he would be able to project who he is as a
person, in keeping with his recent efforts to show a compassionate
side.
   ``It has to be what you feel and what you are,'' he told
reporters flying with him last week on Air Force Two.
   But Bush reflected a calm demeanor toward the debate, saying,
``I don't view it as make or break, or the end of the world, or the
biggest moment of my life.''

   Living in this coastal town, Elwot Avery
learned to pay careful attention to the weather, and on the
afternoon of Sept. 21, 1938, his nose told him to expect an
``autumnal sou'wester.''
   It soon became clear it was something much worse. Trees were
already down when a two-car garage was lifted by the winds before
his eyes.
   ``It went up whole, like a kite, and flew on over the tops of
the trees and smashed in the road just like so much kindling
wood,'' recalls Avery, now 89.
   Impelled beyond reason to see more, Avery left his wife and
stepped outside.
   His hilltop home had become an island; neighboring houses were
swamped in 5 feet of water. The wind nearly blew him off his feet.
He crawled back on his hands and knees.
   The Great New England Hurricane of 1938, which had turned inland
virtually without warning, was the worst natural disaster to hit
the region. Its torrential rains, 30-foot waves and 186 mph winds
pulverized granite seawalls, twisted railroad tracks like spaghetti
and leveled whole forests.
   Moreover, the storm was aimed like a giant wrecking ball at the
most densely populated part of the country, the so-called Gold
Coast between New York and Boston. It wiped out 4,500 homes and
badly damaged 15,000 other buildings, smashed 26,000 cars, sank
6,000 boats and tore down nearly 20,000 miles of electric lines.
   The death toll was generally calculated at 580 killed, 100
missing. Nowhere was it heavier per capita than in Westerly, a town
of barely 20,000 inhabitants today and fewer then.
   Within hours of the storm's passing, the old Westerly High
School became a temporary morgue where bodies _ eventually more
than 100 _ were brought for identification.
   Avery, as owner of a funeral home, was put in charge. Since all
the telephone lines were down, he got a ham radio operator to order
a truckload of caskets. Then he worked round the clock for three
days _ ``living on tomato soup and whiskey'' _ to bury the dead.
   Among them was his own mother, whose beachside cottage had been
smashed to pieces by huge waves. The last time anyone saw her
alive, he says, she was standing in the surf holding the handle of
a suitcase. The suitcase itself had been torn away by the wind.
   There were similar scenes of terror everywhere the hurricane
struck, from Long Island to Maine.
   As the waves swept through downtown Providence, people ran for
higher ground. Some drowned in the streets.
   Claire Powell, who was 9 years old, remembers the terror she
felt when her father did not come home that night.
   ``It turned out he climbed a light pole and hung on until he was
rescued,'' she says, still exuding relief 50 years later.
   Short circuits caused by flooding set off the worst fire that
New London, Conn., had seen since Benedict Arnold and the British
torched the city in 1781. The flames quickly consumed 30 buildings
and threatened the entire business district.
   Firefighters, floundering in water above their waists, watched
in frustration as the hurricane blew the spray from their hoses
back into their faces. Only a shift in the wind saved the city.
   Across the region, the storm cut power, transportation and
telephones, isolating whole communities. In Somerville, Mass.,
physicians delivered babies by candlelight.
   As the Connecticut River rose 25 feet and spilled over its
banks, 10,000 people were evacuated from low-lying areas of
Springfield, Mass.
   After the flooding came looting. Fall River, Marlboro and
Northampton, Mass., were under martial law. National Guardsmen with
fixed bayonets patroled Providence and Westerly.
   But there were also many instances of heroism.
   The New Haven Railroad's Bostonian express was trapped, with 600
aboard, by floodwaters at a trestle near Stonington, Conn. Hulks of
cottages and boats slammed against the cars. Passengers screamed as
the train swayed dangerously.
   The engineer ordered everyone into the first car and the tender
of his locomotive. Wading into shoulder-deep water, he uncoupled
the other cars, then climbed back aboard and opened the throttle,
nudging aside a house that had been tossed onto the tracks and
driving the locomotive inch-by-inch across the buckling trestle to
safety.
   On open water, it was a rare boat that was able to ride out the
storm. In Somerset, Mass., a 600-foot oil tanker was tossed ashore.
In Warwick, R.I., the wind picked up a 30-foot sloop like a toy and
deposited it 40 feet above the ground in the branches of an elm,
where it remained perched and little damaged.
   Katherine Phillips of Providence was blown half-a-mile across
Narragansett Bay clinging to a wooden door.
   Mary Haggerty of East Providence looked out the window of the
small office building where she was working and realized it was
floating in the Seekonk River. She made her way to the roof as the
building swept toward the India Point Bridge. At the moment of
impact, she grabbed the bridge's rail and held on.
   In Hartford, the clock in the Old State House stopped at 4:10
p.m. An 80 mph wind, the highest recorded in the city, tore off
roofs, uprooted trees and toppled buildings.
   In Boston, the historic frigate Constitution was ripped from its
moorings and damaged. Throughout the city, windows bent, then burst
out toward the wind, showering the streets with glass. Some 2,000
injuries were reported.
   The hurricane's damage, in 1938 dollars, was estimated at $400
million _ the equivalent of several billion dollars today. But some
observers believe its effects went well beyond damage to property
and loss of life.
   ``It has been described as an act of God in an age of
innocence,'' says Everett S. Allen, who covered the storm as a
reporter for the Standard-Times of New Bedford and wrote a book
about it, ``A Wind To Shake the World,'' in 1976.
   ``We lived at that time with a general sense that things would
always remain largely as they were. What the storm proved, at first
blush, was that landmarks do not have to endure,'' he says.

<HEAD>New Dictionary May Save Language of Alabama Indian Tribe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of linguists is working to save the
language of the Alabama Indian tribe of eastern Texas, which had no
written grammar or dictionary and was faced with extinction as the
number of speakers dwindled.
   Heather Hardy, an associate professor of English at the
University of North Texas, began the project after receiving a
newspaper clipping in 1980 about an Alabama tribe member who was
using note cards to create a dictionary of her native language.
   Ms. Hardy decided to contact the woman.
   ``I knew not much had been done on the Alabama,'' she said.
``When you've got languages in your own back yard that have hardly
been described at all and are dying out, that takes priority.''
   The Alabama live with the Coushatta tribe on a joint reservation
nestled in the Big Thicket National Preserve, 70 miles northeast of
Houston.
   Ms. Hardy drove to the reservation and found Cora Sylestine, a
former teacher. The two women struck a bargain: Ms. Sylestine would
guide Ms. Hardy through the thickets of her native language if Ms.
Hardy would help her create the dictionary of her dreams.
   First, Ms. Hardy had to create a system of writing to record the
language. And the grammar used by its speakers had to be deciphered
before its words could be broken down for a dictionary.
   Ms. Hardy said the process has been laborious, done on weekends
and school breaks, financed mostly with small grants and personal
funds.
   As of Sept. 1, though, a team working on the project, which
includes University of North Texas linguist Timothy Montler, is
being financed for two years by a $161,000 grant from the National
Endowment for the Humanities and the university.
   Montler, a computer expert, modified a program the team will use
to create the dictionary, which will define Alabama words in
English and vice versa, Ms. Hardy said.
   Transcribing Alabama to written form and translating it to
English hasn't been as tough as working with some other American
Indian languages, which use many sounds that don't exist in
English, Ms. Hardy said. Only one Alabama sound _ a breathy,
slurred ``l'' _ is not found in English, she said. The dictionary
will represent it with an l crossed by a hyphen.
   But the language has its own special quirks.
   In other languages, for instance, plural forms usually add
something, be it an ``s'' in English or some prefix or suffix, Ms.
Hardy said. But in Alabama, to create a plural, the root word is
shortened. The Alabama word ``batatli,'' for example, means to hit
one time, but the word ``batli'' means to hit repeatedly.
   ``We've never found anything like this,'' Ms. Hardy said. ``It
led to the joke that, in Alabama, less is more.''
   Ms. Hardy said she hopes the group's work will allow the tribe
to start a language reclamation program and create collections of
Alabama folk stories. ``Cora says the language is the culture,''
Ms. Hardy said. ``By preserving the language, you preserve a lot of
information about the culture.''

<HEAD>Astronaut John W. Young Disappointed With Space Program Progress</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former chief NASA astronaut says he is
disappointed in the progress of the nation's space program, blaming
the emphasis on the shuttle for a slowdown in space development and
exploration.
   The reusable orbiters on which NASA staked its future in the
early 1970s have never been the workhorses their supporters
promised, says John W. Young.
   ``I think we were being unrealistic about what our capabilities
and limitations were in the old days,'' said Young, who flew on the
first manned Gemini mission in 1965. ``It (the shuttle) just has to
have too much hands-on work done with it to make it do all the
things we wanted it to do.''
   Young, now a safety and engineering trouble-shooter for the
Johnson Space Center's director, orbited the moon and explored its
surface during the Apollo era. He later commanded the first and
ninth shuttle flights.
   ``It is almost 20 years since we landed people on the moon,''
Young said. ``And if you had asked me after the moon landing what
we'd be doing in 20 years, I'd have said we'd have a base on the
moon in 20 years.''
   NASA sold the shuttle to Congress as a quickly refurbishable,
inexpensive-to-operate spacewagon.
   ``I never believed it could be that way,'' Young said. ``I
wasn't involved in selling it, but I was involved in the technical
details of helping design and build it, and it was too
complicated.''
   Young said the shuttle is capable of fulfilling its creators'
expectations, but tight budgets hurt it when NASA could not afford
to stockpile spare parts for quick repairs.
   Quick shuttle turnarounds and reflights and routine Florida
landings never panned out, nor is the shuttle an inexpensive way to
fly, he added. And the assumption that it pays to salvage and reuse
each $15 million solid fuel rocket booster casings may be wrong,
Young said.
   Delays in flights also affect NASA's supply of flight-ready
astronauts. Fourteen astronauts who flew before the shuttle
Challenger exploded decided not to wait for flights to resume. The
space center has 93 astronauts left and is accepting applications
through July 1 for a 1990 astronaut class.
   ``I expect there's a lot of astronauts leaving because they see
the line at the end of the tunnel _ the line they've got to stand
in to get a flight is so long.''

   A policeman who killed a man last month was in
custody Monday, charged with sexual battery on a prostitute,
authorities said.
   Efrain Grillo, 23, was arrested Sunday after the 29-year-old
woman filed a complaint with police. He was jailed without bond.
   Grillo's partner, Daryl Branton, 24, was relieved of duty with
pay pending an investigation, said Miami police spokesman David
Rivero.
   Last month, Grillo fatally shot a street window washer after an
altercation, but the slaying was ruled justifiable after the
officer said the victim pulled a knife on him.
   In the latest incident, Grillo and Branton, both in uniform,
allegedly ordered the woman into the back of the patrol car. She
later told police she thought she was being arrested.
   They drove to a nearby abandoned building and Grillo ordered the
woman out of the car, according to the complaint. He then fondled
her, at one point putting on a rubber glove, the police report
said. Branton allegedly watched but did not participate.

   When he entered the Democratic race for
U.S. Senate, U.S. Rep. Don Bonker said he relished the
``long-distance'' climb it would take to catch his better known
primary opponent, U.S. Rep. Mike Lowry.
   In the days leading up to Tuesday's primary, Bonker was still
running uphill after Lowry.
   On the Republican ticket, Seattle attorney and former U.S. Sen.
Slade Gorton was considered a shoo-in for the nomination for the
post being vacated by retiring Republican Sen. Dan Evans.
   Gorton's two primary opponents had little name recognition and
even less money. As of Aug. 31 Gorton had amassed $891,110 in
donations.
   Political polls gave Lowry, 49, the edge and then some in the
primary.
   He enjoyed an enormous advantage: The resident of the suburb of
Renton is a far more familiar face in the populous Seattle area,
which he has represented for nearly five terms in the House. Bonker
is from Vancouver, in southwestern Washington on the Columbia River.
   Bonker, 51, leads Lowry in the amount of campaign money raised,
although he spent a huge chunk of it early, trying to make himself
better known to voters. As of Aug. 31, Bonker had collected
$849,694, while Lowry raised $803,000.
   Both candidates spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on
last-minute media buys.
   Bonker, a seven-term congresssman, pinned his final push partly
on a pair of statewide TV ads that painted him as a ``doer,'' and
Lowry as a slightly buffoonish blow-hard.
   Bonker also attacked Lowry as a rebel with the wrong cause among
the state's otherwise unified congressional delegation.
   Lowry just smiled and continued to call Bonker ``an excellent
congressman and good friend.''
   Actually, their records are similar and, despite his moderate
image, Bonker's voting record is as liberal as Lowry's.
   But the two differed on at least two vital but somewhat
parochial issues, neither of which seems to have caught fire among
voters. In fact, in eastern Washington the contest was dubbed the
``Invisible Campaign.''
   Bonker favors a measure, stalled in House committee, that would
allow states to ban the export of raw logs as necessary to pull
small and medium sawmills from an economic slump. Lowry opposes the
idea, saying it would cost jobs, hurt the state's badly depleted
common school fund which depends on timber revenue, and invite
foreign trade retaliation.
   Bonker also favors the basing of a Navy ship in Everett, saying
the home port would produce jobs. Lowry calls that ``home
porking,'' and says it is a waste of tax dollars and an
environmental threat.
   While the two Democrats slugged it out, Gorton was busy blasting
both of them as anti-defense liberals from the same pod.
   Gorton, 60, lost his Senate seat in 1986 to Democrat Brock
Adams. Many felt the upset lay partly in Gorton's icy image and
perception that he had stopped listening to voters.
   Gorton vows to ``hear better, to listen better.'' Among other
things, he opposes higher taxes and favors efforts to control crime
and illegal drugs.
   Also on the Republican ballot is Port Angeles attorney Doug
Smith, 59, a former Pentagon and White House aide under presidents
Nixon and Ford who calls Gorton a ``liberal'' and ``loser.''
   The other GOP hopeful is former state Supreme Court Justice
William Goodloe of Seattle, who said recently that his campaign is
focusing on two issues: The ``sicknesses'' of too much campaign
money flowing from political action committees, and pornography.

<HEAD>Court Clears Chinese Paper In Libel Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Beijing court cleared a newspaper of libel for
reporting unsanitary conditions in a factory, and Chinese
journalists said Monday they hope a precedent has been set for
press freedom.
   The official English-language China Daily said the case was
followed closely by Chinese reporters because the country does not
yet have a law stipulating the rights and responsibilities of
newspapers.
   The Xinyuanzhai Beverage Factory of Beijing claimed it lost
$160,000 in business after the Beijing Evening News reported in
July the city was fining it for poor sanitation and flies. The
factory director, Chang Jiangqiu, said the story was erroneous
because he had not paid a fine when the story was published. He
also said the factory did not have flies.
   After a six-hour trial last week, Beijing's Eastern District
Court said the paper had made only ``a minor technical error'' and
that this ``was not enough to support a defamation claim,'' China
Daily reported.
   The court rejected the factory's demand for $13,000 in damages
and ordered it to pay a $5 trial fee. The factory has not said if
it will appeal.
   As part of recent political and economic reforms, the Chinese
media have been allowed to investigate and report disasters,
scandals and corruption as well as cases of consumer abuse that
were previously off-limits.
   One result been an increase in the number of legal complaints
against papers and journalists.
   The Beijing Evening News said it reported on the factory's
failings to fulfill its responsibility as a consumer watchdog, a
new role for China's tightly controlled official press.
   ``This is the first libel case actually brought to court against
a paper,'' said Wu Jingshu, a national news editor at the China
Daily. Other cases have been settled through mediation, he said,
adding: ``Journalists think that papers need something to protect
them. People can sue for anything.''
   The China Daily quoted the Beijing Evening News' deputy chief
editor, Liu Tingzhao, as saying the case illustrated the urgent
need for a journalism law.
   Legislators began drafting a law in 1984 to codify the rights
and responsibilities of journalists, including the right to
criticize government officials. The law is not yet completed.

   Amateur fisherman Tomas Ervik trapped a
22-pound lobster believed to be 40 years old, the oldest and
biggest lobster ever caught in Norway, a newspaper reported Monday.
   The lobster, caught last week off the west coast port of Floroe,
died before it reached Bergen, where it would have been studied at
the national Oceanic Research Institute before going on display at
Bergen's Sea Aquarium.
   ``We'd hoped to get it here alive, but I assume the strain of
being caught after such a long life was too much for the old
giant,'' aquarium spokesman Tor Smuelsen told the Bergens Tidende
newspaper.
   The normal life span of a lobster is 20 to 30 years, the report
said.

   A Hereford bull escaped from its

   The bull thundered through the fairgrounds and out the front
gate, terrifying bystanders. Police eventually caught up with the
bull in a nearby street, where it was tranquilized and captured, a
police spokesman said.
   The bull apparently escaped from its handlers while being
unloaded from a cattle truck. A police car also was slightly
damaged by the rampaging animal.
   The spokesman said 12 people were treated at the show for minor

   Four hunters were killed and at least 20
injured in accidents as Italy's hunting season opened, authorities
reported Monday. Shouting matches also occurred between
environmentalists and hunters.
   One hunter was killed near Florence on Sunday by a shot fired by
another hunter; two hunters died of heart attacks while chasing
game near Bergamo and Parma in northern Italy; and another hunter
was struck and killed by a thunderbolt in central Italy, police
said.
   Police reported that least 20 hunters were injured in accidents
or by ricocheting or inaccurate shots.
   In several regions, members of the environmentalist Green Party
played horns, drums and other noisy instruments to chase game away
before hunters arrived. They then got into shouting matches with
hunters, but no injuries were reported in those confrontations,
police said.
   About 1 million hunters combed woods and countryside on opening
day.

   The United States anticipates difficulty in
dealing with the new government of Haiti if its army is to be
headed by a colonel facing a drug indictment in Florida, the White
House said today.
   Frantz Lubin, Haiti's director of information, said in
Port-au-Prince over the weekend that Jean-Claude Paul, commander of
the Dessalines Barracks, was assuming command of the army. However,
Gen. Prosper Avril, in announcing Sunday that he was assuming the
presidency, did not mention Paul.
   Paul has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Florida on
drug trafficking charges.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said today that Paul's
appointment ``would be a telling symbol about the intentions of the
new president.''
   ``On the surface, it would be difficult to detect much
difference'' in the Haitian government as a result of the weekend
coup that ousted President Henri Namphy, Fitzwater said.
   ``I guess the thing we are looking for at the moment is who does
he (Avril) appoint to various key positions in the government, and
that will give us an indication of how he plans to proceed,''
Fitzwater said.
   Appointing Paul, he said, ``would certainly give us an
indication of the difficulties we will have with this government if
he is appointed.''
   The United States was providing Haiti with about $100 million a
year in economic aid until last November, when aid was suspended
after elections were aborted by violence.
   ``Certainly there is no consideration at this point of changing
that situation,'' Fitzwater said.
   State Department spokeswoman Anita Stockman said Sunday, ``We
have seen the press reports about Colonel Paul. Our position on him
is well known. He is under indictment on narcotics charges and we
continue to believe he should answer those charges in court.''
   Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs,
which has been critical of Reagan administration policy toward
Haiti, said Paul's status ``will continue to pose a major dilemma
for Avril, because if he wants to get renewed U.S. economic aid,
and military aid as well, he has got to not only lead the country
to democratic reforms and the staging of elections, but he has to
find some way to hand Paul over to the American authorities.''
   Officials in Washington still were seeking information about the
Haitian coup.
   ``I don't know any more than you do,'' President Reagan told
reporters as he returned to the White House after a weekend at Camp
David, the presidential retreat in Maryland.
   Ms. Stockman said, ``The motivation is not entirely clear,
although we understand that the non-commissioned officers who acted
against (ousted Haitian President Henri) Namphy were dissatisfied
with recent human rights violations and the general deterioration
in the security situation, punctuated by attacks against the
churches over the past two weeks.''
   Birns said troops under Paul's command had been sent to guard
Roman Catholic churches in Port-au-Prince in recent days. The
700-man Dessalines Barracks, located across the street from the
national palace, is the most feared unit of the 7,000-man national
army and Paul has been considered the most powerful figure in Haiti
after Namphy.
   Birns said he regarded the coup as ``a hopeful sign'' although
he was ``skeptical that democracy is near in Haiti.''
   ``Avril and the institutionalists in the Haitian military
recognize the country faces a dead end,'' he said, ``that without
renewed U.S. economic aid and loans from the multilateral lending
agencies, Haiti is going to soon dissolve.''
   ``Avril can be counted on to begin a process that will lead to
the staging of elections,'' Birns said. ``But his major problem
remains Jean-Claude Paul, who fears extradition to the United
States.''
   Ms. Stockman said there were no reports that Americans had been
injured.
   She said the airport in the Haitian capital was closed and a
travel advisory cautioned Americans to avoid non-essential travel
and advised them to contact the embassy if they must travel.

<HEAD>Gorbachev To Complainers In Krasnoyarsk: Perestroika is the Answer</HEAD>
<HEAD>AP News Analysis</HEAD>

   Promises, promises, promises _ but no action, the
people complained to Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Perestroika, perestroika, perestroika, he answered, referring to
his program to restructure the economy.
   The Soviet leader logged hundreds of miles last week in a major
trip to check the pulse of the people. The pulse in eastern
Siberia, he found, was rapid _ from anger. He got an earful of
complaints about everything from apartments without hot water to
stores without meat.
   ``I felt it's already impossible to talk to the people,'' the
57-year-old Communist Party general secretary told local officials
on only the second day of a five-day visit to Krasnoyarsk.
   ``Wherever I was _ on the street, in a factory, or here _ the
people are simply at your throat. And I think they're right.''
   Gorbachev was hearing that perhaps more than anything else
Soviets want a better place to live and more food on their tables.
   By choosing Krasnoyarsk for the trip, Gorbachev was asking for
complaints.
   On July 29, he told a plenary session of the party's
policy-making Central Committee in Moscow that medical service and
other ``urgent problems'' were particularly acute in the region,
which is 2,000 miles east of Moscow and encompasses one-tenth of
the entire country.
   Since the plenum, Soviet television, newspapers and magazines
have railed about food and consumer goods shortages and the
resulting long store lines that symbolize the hardships Soviets
endure every day. The media also has complained about the failure
of the government to satisfy the peoples' basic needs.
   Gorbachev has repeatedly said improving the daily lives of
Soviets is a priority in his reform drive. Soviet and Western
economists have said that Gorbachev must offer rewards in the form
of better housing, food, consumer goods and higher pay if he is to
get more work out of people.
   For now, though, people seem unhappy, and Gorbachev returned
Monday from a six-week vacation in the Crimean sun to face angry
complaints shouted at him by residents of a tiny village of
Yemelyanovo near Krasnoyarsk.
   ``We have no hot water. You do what you can to wash,'' one man
shouted.
   Other residents complained about poor medical facilities in the
region, a shortage of housing and a lack of meat in stores.
   The angry streetside exchange in Yemelyanovo and elsewhere,
broadcast on the popular evening news program ``Vremya,'' were a
marked departure from previous citizens' discussions with top
Soviet officials.
   Before Gorbachev took power, citizens largely kept their
complaints to themselves, praising government policies when meeting
with officials or asking uncritical questions. But Gorbachev, with
his populist style, encouragement of openness and his desire to
stay in touch with the people, changed that.
   The leadership emphasized the importance of the trip by making
it one of the longest that Gorbachev has made within the Soviet
Union since he became general secretary in March 1985, and by
devoting hours of television coverage and the front pages of most
newspapers to it daily.
   The leadership's concern was reinforced by another, simultaneous
trip by KGB Chairman Viktor Chebrikov to Vladivostok, a Pacific
port. Chebrikov, who like Gorbachev is a member of the ruling
Politburo, also heard complaints about work and living conditions,
medical cases and shortages of consumer goods.
   Gorbachev did not deny that perestroika had failed to improve
people's lives adequately. His response to the complaints was to
blame local and central officials and people who had not fully
endorsed perestroika and were sticking to the ``old ways.'' Still,
he said, changes for the better are evident in increasing
production of consumer goods, housing and dairy and meat products.
   ``We have policies that are criticized from all sides, but no
one can suggest anything else,'' he said. ``We have a different
mood, different position, different relation to the country and the
people.''
   But he said patience was required because tough times are ahead.
   ``Do you think that I, as general secretary, do not want all the
problems to be solved as soon as possible? How nice it would have
been if we could reach agreement today and have things sorted out
tomorrow.''
   And at the end of the visit on Friday, Gorbachev, sounding like
a cheerleader or politician on the campaign trail, told Krasnoyarsk
party and government officials he had learned that ``Citizens of
Krasnoyarsk have accepted perestroika.'' Then, he asked, ``Am I
making the correct conclusion?'' The audience broke out in
thunderous applause.

   The Dutch army withdrew 500
soldiers on Monday from a NATO maneuver in West Germany after one
of the unit's members died of meningitis, an army spokesman said.
   Another soldier from the 107th Field Artillery Unit was
hospitalized with suspected meningitis Monday but was reported in
satisfactory condition, according to the spokesman, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The 500 soldiers, part of a 34,000-strong Dutch contingent at
the Free Lion maneuver, will all undergo medical checks, the
spokesman said.
   Other nations participating in the 45,000-member Free Lion force
are West Germany, Britain and the United States.

   The Reagan administration said today it is
reviewing assistance programs for Burma to determine whether aid
should be cut off or reduced in light of the military coup and
violence in that country.
   ``The United States is deeply concerned about and deplores the
violence that has erupted once again in Burma,'' White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   ``Whatever the country's political problems, they cannot be
solved by Burmese killing one another,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``The United States urges Burmese military authorities
immediately to cease shooting at demonstrators and calls upon those
demonstrating to refrain from provocative actions. It further calls
upon military authorities to enter into discussions with opposition
leaders on arrangements for an early transition to multi-party
democracy, which Burmese in overwhelming numbers are demanding and
which the authorities say they are prepared to grant.''
   ``In light of developments over the past 48 hours, we are
reviewing our assistance programs to Burma,'' the spokesman said.
   The United States is providing $14 million in aid to Burma in
the current fiscal year.
   Fitzwater said the review was being conducted ``with an eye
toward should it (the aid program) be eliminated or changed in any
way.''

<HEAD>Korean Media Gives Blanket Coverage To Olympics, Foreigners</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bursting with Olympic pride, the South
Korean media is deluging the country with saturation coverage of
the Games, including a look at the peculiar habits of foreign
visitors.
   Newspapers are racing each other to praise the Olympics that are
seen by Koreans as the turning point in the nation's transformation
into a leading industrial power.
   ``Seoul Captivates World,'' ``Greatest Ever Show On Earth'' and
``Closest Thing To Perfection,'' trumpeted banner headlines hailing
the Games.
   Some newspapers predicted the Olympics could be a turning point
for the entire world by helping to usher in peace and
understanding. ``Curtain Rises On World In Harmony,'' proclaimed
the Chosun Ilbo.
   The country's three main televison channels are carrying little
but Olympic coverage from early morning until well past midnight
with important events repeated several times on each channel.
   South Korean newspapers are devoting more than half their pages
to coverage of the Olympics with other news crowded onto back pages
as every facet of the Games is breathlessly recounted.
   Seoul newspapers don't normally publish Monday morning or Sunday
evening, but they are for the Olympics. Most papers have added up
to eight extra pages to cope with Olympic coverage.
   Local journalists say Olympic fever has swept their publications
with editors and reporters striving to produce the best coverage.
``We are so excited about this festival. Newspapers are just
writing everything that comes to mind,'' said a senior journalist
who demanded anonymity.
   The press has also been taking a look at the foreign tourists in
town for the Olympics. Most South Koreans have little experience of
foreigners, and thousands of tourists have been an eye-catching
sight.
   ``People, both Koreans and foreigners,'' began a story in The
Korean Herald. The story praised Koreans for their orderly
behavior, with the implication that foreigners were not so well
behaved.
   ``Korean spectators waited in long lines to enter stadiums in an
orderly manner, showing a high sense of order,'' it said.
   Newspapers have complained about foreigners selling Olympic
tickets, but without mentioning that Koreans are doing the same
thing.
   Dong-a Ilbo lambasted some members of the International Olympic
Committee for being arrogant, claiming they refused to ride to
group events in buses and their wives were rude to Korean workers.
   Chosun Ilbo noted the American team was the ``most free or
liberal'' during the athletes parade in the opening ceremony.
   Radical students, who demanded the Olympics be shared with
communist North Korea, focused on the Americans in leaflets that
said, ``The ugliness of Yankees was fully displayed during the
opening parade.''
   But foreigners ready to praise South Korea and the staging of
the Olympics are quickly singled out for media attention. ``Heaven
provided a glorious day like today for Koreans to demonstrate the
stamina which has sustained them during so many dark years,'' one
American was quoted as saying.

<HEAD>Bush, Dukakis Lighten Schedules To Prepare for Debate</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Top 12 grafs new with Dukakis, Bush, Quayle; pick up 6th graf
pvs bgng ``In a speech...</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush said today that Democrat Michael Dukakis
has ``raised all sorts of taxes'' in Massachusetts and will do the
same nationally if elected. Dukakis retorted that the Reagan
administration has left a ``sea of Republican red ink that not even
Moses could part.''
   Bush and his running mate, Dan Quayle, both launched
economic-based attacks on Dukakis to kick off a week that will see
relatively little campaigning as the presidential candidates
prepare for their first debate next Sunday.
   In Philadelphia, Bush charged Dukakis with championing an
``anti-business scheme'' that has caused higher taxes and soaring
business bankruptcies in Massachusetts.
   Bush told a local Chamber of Commerce that the Democratic
governor this year has ``raised all sorts of taxes: the income tax,
the sales tax and one that might be of special interest to this
audience'' _ an additional tax on state business.
   Quayle, at a rally in Knoxville, Tenn., said Dukakis had imposed
``an economic manacle'' on the state's economy _ a satirical
reference to Dukakis' claim of an economic miracle in Massachusetts.
   ``He raised virtually every tax in Massachusetts ...'' said
Quayle. ``Now I know what he means when he talks about good jobs at
good wages. If he is elected president, he is going to take your
good jobs at your good wages.''
   In remarks prepared for a Little Rock, Ark., appearance, Dukakis
said he was tired of Bush using selective statistics to misconstrue
the state of the economy _ both in Massachusetts and nationally.
   ``Mark Twain once said that there were three kinds of
falsehoods: lies, damn lies, and statistics,'' Dukakis said. ``Mr.
Bush...likes statistics; the statistics that show that more
Americans are working, but do not tell you the quality of their
jobs. Statistics that tell us that some people and some states are
doing very, very well; but don't tell us about the daily struggle
of many Americans to pay their bills.''
   He also said not all is well with the federal economy as long as
the budget deficit runs into the billions of dollars.
   ``The next president will inherit a sea of Republican red ink
that not even Moses could part,'' Dukakis said.
   Both candidates kept their campaign schedules light this week
with plenty of time set aside to prepare for their first debate.
Bush press secretary Sheila Tate said the vice president would spar
in mock debate with former deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman
playing the role of Dukakis.
   While Bush's only public appearance Sunday was to go to church
in Washington, his surrogates were attacking Dukakis, with one, GOP
Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, calling the Democratic presidential
nominee ``nuts.''
   In a speech Sunday to the California Republican Convention,
Gingrich accused Dukakis of being a ``left-winger'' who opposes
weapons systems supported by Bush.
   ``It's not that Dukakis isn't a patriot. It's that Dukakis is
nuts,'' Gingrich said. ``His value system has no relation to
reality.''
   Dukakis spokesman Mark Gearan responded by saying, ``Americans
are increasingly tiring of Gingrich's one-liners.''
   ``His attempt with innuendo and lies and misrepresentation of
the governor's position is typical of his nasty approach,'' Gearan
said.
   Bush and Dukakis both have lightened their calendars in
preparation for their face-to-face meeting next Sunday night in
Winston-Salem, N.C., the first of two televised debates between the
presidential candidates.
   Both candidates commented on the weekend's military coup in
Haiti, with Bush saying ``It's too early to say what happened.''
But he added, ``We want democracy for Haiti, for the whole of the
Caribbean and for the whole of Central America.''
   Dukakis issued a statement calling for the United States to
recall its ambassador from Haiti for consultations while refusing
to recognize the country's military government.
   ``The people of Haiti have suffered far too long under
successive repressive regimes,'' the Dukakis statement said.
   The Republican vice president, speaking to reporters after
attending Sunday church services, said, ``I think I've done the
homework'' for the debate.
   ``It's like a ball game, getting up for it, mentally up and
physically up,'' Bush said.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, who lost to Bush in
the race for the GOP presidential nomination, said the debate next
week could cause a shift in the political landscape.
   ``The stakes are high. This is hard ball,'' Dole said in an
appearance in Ohio on Sunday. ``I don't worry about George Bush.
The big difference is he knows what he's talking about. Now, maybe
Dukakis can memorize enough to get through the debate, but he'll
forget it right afterwards.''
   However, Dukakis was not without his defenders.
   Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, took the Republicans to task for
their criticism of Dukakis' veto of Massachusetts legislation that
would have required teachers to lead classes in the Pledge of
Allegiance.
   ``There is no greater phony issue that's been raised in this
campaign,'' Mitchell said on ABC's ``This Week With David
Brinkley.'' ``In America, the pledge means something because we say
it freely. ... We are not forced to do so.''

<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people have started
returning to the homes they abandoned when rising waters from
overflowing rivers inundated them more than two weeks ago,
officials said Monday.
   They face the prospect of rebuilding their homes and lives after
most of their meager belongings have been lost.
   Bangladesh is one of the world's poorest nations with a per
capita income of $150 per year. The flooding, the worst in the
nation's history, affected 40 million people, more than a third of
Bangladesh's 110 million population.
   At least 53 of the country's 64 administrative districts were
covered by flood waters at the height of the disaster, officials
said.
   Relief Ministry officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Monday that hundreds of flood victims, mainly in the northern
districts, were leaving relief centers and high dikes where they
sought shelter and returning home.
   ``We have reports that displaced people have started going back
home as flooded rivers have receded, improving the situation,'' one
official said. ``It is difficult to estimate the number of
returnees at this stage.''
   An independent Bengali-language daily, the Sangbad, said more
than 168,000 people affected by floods in Pabna district, 75 miles
northwest of Dhaka, had returned to their homes over the past week.
   ``A major problem the victims are now facing is lack of money to
rebuild their ruined houses,'' the paper said Monday.
   Refugees are still arriving in Dhaka, a city of 6 million
people, in search of food, shelter and jobs. Dhaka's central
Kamalapur rail station is crowded with flood refugees who arrive
daily. At least 2,000 people arrived from other parts of the
country over the weekend, station officials said.
   ``The floods, like a demon, has taken everything _ my house and
crops,'' said Nur Ali, a farmer. Ali, who came to Dhaka with his
wife and two teen-age daughters on Saturday, is living at the
railroad station.
   ``We have been living on the roads for more than two weeks, and
we received barely any relief,'' said Ali, adding that he hopes to
find a job in the capital as a day laborer.
   More than 1 million people are living in the 476 flood-relief
centers set up in Dhaka, which also was badly hit by the flooding.
Food supplies at the centers in the capital are better than those
elsewhere, refugees said. Each day, adults receive one pound of
rice and children one-half pound.
   Several journalists unions in Bangladesh criticized the
government for inadequate relief efforts and said in a statement
Sunday that the government was suppressing facts about the
intensity of flooding and the death toll.
   ``The suppression of facts in such an emergency would be harmful
to the nation,'' the statement said.
   The government death toll from the floods, generally considered
understated, is 1,000. Newspapers, carrying their own daily
tallies, estimate that at least twice as many people have died.
   Of these, newspapers said, nearly 1,000 people died of diarrhea
and other water-borne diseases such as cholera. According to the
reports, more than 1 million people have contracted diarrhea from
drinking the muddy flood water.
   The government says only 200 people have died of diarrhea.

   Hurricane Gilbert's remnants swept from Texas to Illinois today
with heavy rain and flooding that forced evacuations in one
Oklahoma town. The storm earlier spun off 41 tornadoes and killed
three people in Texas and Oklahoma.
   The low-pressure system that last week was the strongest
hurricane on record in the Western Hemisphere spread showers and
thunderstorms along a line toward the northeast, with gusts to
about 40 mph this morning.
   The storm system itself picked up speed to about 45 to 50 mph,
said Dan McCarthy, of the National Weather Service.
   ``It's scooting,'' said McCarthy, of the Severe Storms Center in
Kansas City, Mo.
   Meanwhile, workers in Monterrey, Mexico, searched for the bodies
of up to 200 people swept away when a river swollen by hurricane
rains poured over its banks and overturned four buses. Ninety
bodies were recovered and a total of 191 people were confirmed dead
in the aftermath of Gilbert outside the United States.
   Late Sunday, the storm moved over Wichita Falls, Texas, with
rain and high wind, and today it was over eastern Oklahoma.
   An area west of Wichita Falls was deluged with 4{ inches of
rain, and roads in Ozona, in western Texas, were under water. The
mass of moisture extended to Chicago.
   Parts of Oklahoma received up to 8 inches of rain in two days,
causing minor flooding.
   About a dozen residents of a low-lying area in Kingfisher,
Okla., evacuated late Sunday, and others were told to be ready to
leave. Kingfisher Creek was expected to rise as much as 4 feet
above flood stage today, said police dispatcher Lois Darling.
   ``It's already a foot past flood stage and rising,'' Ms. Darling
said early today.
   Elsewhere in Oklahoma, a 50-year-old pilot from Santa Fe, N.M.,
was killed late Saturday when his plane broke apart while flying
near Muskokee, northeast of Oklahoma City, in heavy rain produced
by Gilbert, authorities said.
   Although the brunt of the hurricane missed the U.S. Gulf Coast,
at least 41 tornadoes spun off by the storm damaged homes and
businesses in Texas.
   The Rio Grande River in southwest Texas was expected to rise to
12 feet above flood stage.
   In San Antonio, a man was killed Friday when a twister knocked a
utility pole onto his home, and woman died early Saturday after a
tornado ripped through her mobile home.
   ``We'll take one day at a time. We'll clean up and eventually
we'll get our own house put up if we get some money to buy lumber
and tin,'' said Deborah Dickens, whose mother-in-law, Emily
Dickens, was killed.
   Other tornadoes in San Antonio uprooted trees, snapped power
lines and tore off roofs. Damage there was estimated at more than
$35 million, including $25 million harm to aircraft parts at Kelly
Air Force Base.
   Sylvia Sulsh, 54, said she was taking a shower early Saturday
when a tornado struck her apartment at a San Antonio complex where
at least 120 units were destroyed, 264 others damaged and 300
tenants left homeless.
   ``I got out of the shower and braced myself against the door and
then I saw the roof fall down in the living room,'' Ms. Sulsh said.
   Mayor Henry Cisneros said the city was lucky the death toll was
low.
   Crews restored power and telephone service Sunday and removed
debris from streets, while those whose homes were damaged made
repairs.
   The storm killed at least 98 people while coursing the
Caribbean, including 29 in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, where it hit
with winds of up to 200 mph, 26 in Jamaica, 30 in Haiti, five in
the Dominican Republic and eight in Honduras.
   Offshoots of the hurricane produced heavy rain over the Florida
Panhandle last week and miles of roads and bridges remained flooded
today around the city of Milton, about 30 miles northeast of
Pensacola. So far this month, Pensacola has recorded 11.7 inches of
rain; normal rainfall for the period is 4.6 inches.
   The Blackwater River at Milton rose above its banks for a second
time in as many weeks Saturday, damaging about 40 houses and 20
mobile homes, said Tom Roche, civil defense director for Santa Rosa
County. The first round of flooding was caused by rain associated
with Hurricane Florence.

   Michael Dukakis accused Republican
George Bush today of campaigning with ``a warmed-over call to
selfishness'' and said a Democratic White House would seek
prosperity for all Americans, not just the wealthy.
   The Democratic presidential nominee said Bush does not
understand that GOP economic policies have not spread their
benefits across the economy but had served people who already have
good jobs _ or inherited wealth.
   ``But most Americans aren't satisfied, and neither am I,'' the
Massachusetts governor told an invitation-only campaign rally.
   In a line borrowed from John F. Kennedy, Dukakis said he means
``to get America moving again,'' restoring strength to all parts of
the economy and all sections of the nation.
   He said the next president will face ``a sea of Republican red
ink that not even Moses could part.''
   In his prepared speech, Dukakis said federal resources are
limited but problems cannot be shrugged away.
   ``And we can't afford leadership that says over and over again
that it's morning in America and then suggests that all we
Americans have to do is roll over and go back to sleep,'' he said.
   Dukakis said Bush is the candidate of a complacent party that
``seems to have exhausted its reservoir of ideas'' for dealing with
the economy.
   ``In their hearts they know that four more years of Reaganomics
would be bad for the country, and that four more years of
Reaganomics without Reagan would be a disaster.''

<HEAD>Philippines Naval Officer Fired For Causing Flap With Malaysia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A navy commodore who caused a
diplomatic flap by claiming Malaysia had annexed six Philippine
islands was fired Monday after officials said he misread a
navigational chart.
   A statement by the armed forces also said a colonel was relieved
of command in the central Visayas region after telling reporters
that 1,000 Roman Catholic priests and nuns in his area were
communist sympathizers.
   Commodore Juanito Cortez, commander of naval district 6, was
fired for ``insubordination'' after he reportedly told visiting
congressmen that Malaysia had effectively annexed six southern
Philippine islands, the statement said.
   The lawmakers said Cortez based his claim on what he said was a
Malaysian map showing the six islands in the Turtle Island chain in
Malaysian territory.
   Cortez's remark prompted charges by Filipino legislators that
Malaysia was encroaching on its territory. But last week, the chief
of staff, Gen. Renato de Villa, said the ``boundary'' shown on the
map was actually a recommended navigational direction and not an
international border.
   Leticia Shahani, chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs
Committee, issued a public apology on Friday after she denounced
the alleged incursions by Malaysia based on Cortez's statements.
   ``The inquiry showed Cortez violated...the concept of chain of
command by failing to convey through proper channels such
information of national and international importance that would be
acted upon by higher authorities before disclosing it,'' the
military statement said.
   In Cebu, the deputy commander of the Visayas Command, Col.
Apolinario Castano, was stripped of his command for issuing
statements about priests and nuns in the rebel movement that had
``no basis in official records,'' the military said. Castano's
claim of up to 1,000 rebel sympathizers in the clergy led to
denuniciations by the Roman Catholic leadership.

<HEAD>Researcher Adds History, Facts, to Danielle Steel's Best-Sellers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLIFF EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nancy Eisenbarth waits anxiously to read every
one of Danielle Steel's novels, but she's more than a fan _ her
research provides believable backdrops for the steamy melodramas.
   The friends' working relationship began one day over lunch in
San Francisco, when Ms. Steel was fretting over some factual
details in ``The Ring.'' It was her first hardcover book, published
in 1980, and chronicled three generations of women.
   ``I offered to look some things up, and we went on from there,''
said Ms. Eisenbarth. ``I had no inkling that she would become as
successful as she has, and I had no idea it would be as much fun.''
   Many of Ms. Steel's novels _ which include ``Zoya,''
``Passages'' and ``Fine Things'' _ wind up on The New York Times
best-seller list. In fact, she's had as many as three on the list
at one time. Her books _ 35 in all _ have been published in 27
languages, and more than 85 million copies are in print.
   Ms. Eisenbarth, a history major in college, receives long plot
summaries from Ms. Steel for new books. She then spends nearly four
months researching details of the time period described in the
outline.
   ``She makes up the story and I provide the background,'' Ms.
Eisenbarth, 41, said in a telephone interview from the west Chicago
suburb of Naperville. ``I play a small part in making them seem
realistic.''
   Ms. Steel said her researcher's role is crucial to the success
of her books.
   ``Nancy has been my mainstay for years and years and years,''
Ms. Steel said from her home in San Francisco. ``She's modest in
talking about her role, but her part is really very, very
important.''
   Ms. Eisenbarth's research takes her not to exotic locales, but
to libraries.
   Because Ms. Steel is ``so glamorous and exciting, everybody
thinks my job is glamorous and exciting, but it's really most of
the time in the stacks,'' said Ms. Eisenbarth, who has researched
14 Steel novels.
   She relies on personal diaries, pictures and social histories.
   Ms. Steel insists that every detail be correct, down to the
perfume a historical figure might have worn or the name of a club
where he or she might have gone.
   Still, Ms. Eisenbarth said, there's always one fact in every
book that she has trouble tracking down, and usually finds after
the book is published.
   ``I could not find the color of General Rommel's eyes, so I made
them a glittery blue,'' she said. ``Later I found a (color) picture
and his eyes were clearly brown.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two members of the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission who frequently disagree with one other united Monday in
complaining to a Senate committee that their chairman is cutting
them off from the commission staff.
   ``I do not like the constraints I am laboring under,'' Charles
Stalon, a Democrat who has been behind many of the commission's
deregulatory initiatives, told the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee.
   His colleague, Charles Trabandt, a Republican who has urged a
go-slow policy on further deregulation, said, ``My staff cannot get
the answer to any question without the prior approval of the
chairman and I think that's unfortunate.''
   Trabandt said he thought the ``work product'' of the commission
staff ought to be subject to some kind of review, but he and his
assistants should be able to get ``factual and legal information
available to the staff.''
   ``I do believe I ought to be able to call on the staff to draft
alternative proposals for my fellow commissioners,'' Stalon said.
   By law, the FERC chairman, Martha Hesse, has sole control over
the commission staff, save for personal assistants each of the five
commissioners may hire.
   Ms. Hesse is traveling in Europe and spokeswoman Tamara
Young-Allen said, ``There will be no comment for now.''
   Trabandt and Stalon appeared at a hearing on their renominations
to the commission by President Reagan. With them was Texas oil and
gas consultant Jerry J. Langdon, nominated last month to a vacancy
on the commission.
   The committee earlier approved nominations for the other two
FERC seats as part of a package deal with the White House to break
a year-long deadlock over the makeup of the commission. The deal
gives Democrats three of the five seats but leaves Ms. Hesse, a
Republican, as chairman.
   The complaints from Trabandt and Stalon emerged under
questioning from senators.
   The ranking Republican committee member, Sen. James McClure of
Idaho, said, ``There is some reality to (reports of) difficulties
in the management of the commission.''
   He said he hoped the planned confirmations of the three holdover
commissioners and two newcomers would lead to ``better
relationships inside the commission.''

   Two small boatloads of Cuban exiles trying
ng to sail to that island nation as a human rights protest returned
here Monday after Cuban coastal authorities turned them back.
   The ``Reunion Flotilla'' was timed to coincide with the visit of
the United Nations Human Rights Commission to Cuba.
   The two boats _ along with two other boats carrying reporters _
were stopped by Cuban gunboats Sunday night, said WSVN-TV reporter
Brian Cabell, who accompanied the flotilla.
   He said two representatives of the group went on board one of
the Cuban gunboats and talked with officials for 15 minutes. The
exiles then decided to return to Key West.
   ``We were never threatened really by the Cubans,'' Cabell said
Monday. ``Though for a few anxious moments we thought we might be
rammed by the gunboat.''
   He said the organizers were satisified they had demonstrated
that Cuba was violating their rights by not allowing Cubans to
enter and leave the country as they pleased.

   Charlton Heston doesn't speak Chinese, but that
hasn't stopped him from directing an all-Chinese cast in the
Beijing debut of the play ``The Caine Mutiny Court Martial.''
   ``Since I know the play very well myself I've been able to
follow the lines quite well in a language I do not understand,''
the Academy Award-winning actor said Monday at a news conference
following two days of rehearsals with the People's Art Theater of
Beijing. The debut is Oct. 18.
   When translations fail, he says, he acts out what he has in mind
and the Chinese actors follow suit.
   ``It's a heady feeling _ it makes you feel you are speaking
Mandarin'' Heston said.
   Heston acted in more than 250 stage performances of the ``Caine
Mutiny'' in the United States, playing the lead role of Captain
Queeg, a World War II Navy captain whose tyranny and mental
instability during a typhoon drove his men to mutiny.

   Valerie Harper says she hopes her

image as a ``hellish demon.''
   But Lorimar attorney Don Engle says he is preparing an appeal to
the jury's decision Friday that Miss Harper had been wrongfully
fired from Lorimar's ``Valerie'' series and awarded her $1.4
million compensation for lost wages. She and her husband also were
awarded a percentage of the show's gross profits, which could total
$15 million.
   ``There were so many half-truths, and out-and-out untruths about
me, my performing, about my stability as a person, my psychological
state,'' she said at her Beverly Hills home Saturday. ``It's good
copy, a hysterical woman, particularly with the sexism that's
rampant out there.''
   She says the verdict was sweet. ``It's so nice to see
`wrongfully fired' after all I've seen is fired, fired, fired,''
she said.

   Paul Schrader, director of the movie ``Patty

Hearst media empire should live on and on.
   ``It's our current-day folklore,'' said Schrader, who is known
for ``American Gigolo'' and ``Mishima.'' ``It was like Polaroid
folklore _ it happened instantly. It turned from a news event into
part of a common folklore in a matter of months.
   ``It will endure because of the inherent elements: an heiress
kidnapped by white revolutionaries wanting to be black, who becomes
involved in bank robberies and other events. It's kind of Billy the
Kid territory,'' he said.
   Patricia Hearst Shaw was kidnapped in 1974 by a terrorist group
calling itself the Symbionese Liberation Army. The FBI captured her
after she had traveled with the group for 19 months. She served two
years of a seven-year jail term before being pardoned by
then-President Carter.
   Mrs. Shaw now lives in Westport, Conn., with her husband,
Bernard, and their two daughters.

   An explosion and fire at an apartment house today
injured at least four people, two critically, and left the owner
unaccounted for, authorities said.
   The owner was presumed to be in the basement under debris, Fire
Department spokesman Tom Sheppard said. ``He was working with a
furnace or something down there,'' Sheppard said.
   The explosion at the three-story building on the city's North
Side was reported at 10:12 a.m.
   ``It was a terrible boom,'' said Bengina Slouborg, 91, who lives
nearby. ``I thought it was my building. The windows were shaking.
The building was shaking. The whole side of that building is blown

   Two men were taken critical condition to Cook County Hospital's
burn unit, said Debbie Longstreet, a spokeswoman at St. Francis
Hospital in Evanston, where the men first were taken. Two women
were treated for hand and foot cuts, she said.
   Ed Joyce, a spokesman for Peoples Gas, said the utility shut off
gas to the building after the fire was reported.
   ``There was a fire there last winter,'' said Liz Correa, who
lives in the neighborhood and she was once a tenant in the
building. ``Now there's another explosion. It doesn't sound like a
safe building.''

<TEXT>
   Doctors on Monday upgraded the condition
of confessed pipe-bomb killer and forger Mark Hofmann, who is being
treated for a drug overdose, from serious to fair.
   Hofmann, who pleaded guilty to two 1985 bombing murders, was
flown Thursday to the University of Utah Health Sciences Center
after a cellmate found him comatose at the Utah State Prison.
   Hofmann initially was listed in critical condition from an
overdose of an anti-depressant drug.
   ``He appears, medically, to be progressing well,'' hospital
spokesman John Dwan said. ``He's eating on his own and following
medical instructions.''
   However, Dwan said doctors planned to perform some minor surgery
soon to clean out a wound on Hofmann's arm and possibly do some
skin grafting.
   Hofmann suffered an injury from reduced blood circulation caused
by lying in one position for an extended period of time prior to
being discovered unconscious last week.
   Dwan said Hofmann would remain at the hospital ``for a few more
days at least.''
   Hofmann would likely continue to have problems with his arm due
to muscle degeneration, he added, and ``will require some
hospitalization again in the near future.''
   Hofmann was sentenced to five years to life in prison after
pleading guilty in January 1987 to having planted the bombs that
killed Steven Christensen, a documents collector, and Kathleen
Sheets, the wife of Christensen associate Gary Sheets.
   Hofmann also was charged with multiple counts of fraud in the
forgery of historical documents, many of which were sold to the
Mormon Church.
   He confessed that he planted the bombs in an attempt to cover up
his forgeries, and as part of a plea bargain arrangement pleaded
guilty to two fraud counts in exchange for the others being dropped.
   Earlier this year, the State Board of Pardons told him he would
spend the rest of his life in prison.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opponents of legislation to curb textile,
clothing and shoe exports have agreed to allow a House vote on the
Senate-passed bill rather than sending it to a House-Senate
conference committee, a supporter of the measure said Monday.
   The decision virtually assures a pre-election showdown on the
textile bill between President Reagan and Congress.
   Rep. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., said he expects the House to vote Friday
to approve the Senate-passed bill and send it to Reagan, whose 1985
veto of a similar textile bill was sustained by just eight votes in
the House.
   ``I don't know if we have picked up any votes or not since the
last override we had,'' Jenkins said. ``I think it would be a tough
job to override.''
   Jenkins said the decision to allow a House vote on the
Senate-passed bill was relayed to textile-state lawmakers late last
week by Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee.
   The committee had voted earlier last week to send the Senate
bill to a time-consuming conference committee. With only weeks left
before the 100th Congress adjourns, that probably would have
enabled Reagan to kill the bill simply by refusing to sign it once
Congress left town.
   The legislation would freeze textile and clothing imports at
1987 levels this year and limit import growth to 1 percent annually
threafter. It also would cap shoe imports at 1987 levels and
prohibit foreign manufacturers from increasing their share of the
U.S. market.
   Proponents of the legislation contend it is needed to save
American jobs in a textile industry whose markets are being flooded
with imports. Critics, contending that the industry is flourishing
despite imports, say the legislation would narrow consumer choices
and encourage manufacturers to cut corners with shoddy goods.

   The city used $24,800 in seized drug profits
and fines Monday to finance the bulldozing of 12 crack houses in
the second phase of a high-profile crackdown on drug dealers.
   Police said evidence of drugs or drug paraphernalia was found in
each of the houses.
   ``We're using money we've taken from the dealers and sticking it
to the dealers,'' said Mayor Sandy Freedman.
   About 100 dilapidated, abandoned houses are in the legal process
moving toward condemnation, a time-consuming and costly process,
the mayor said.
   ``It's making a dent. It keeps drug dealers on the move, forcing
them out into the streets. It's easier and safer for law enforcment
to deal with them out in the open. And it's cleaning up
neighborhoods,'' Mrs. Freedman said.
   In May, Tampa demolished 54 houses to kick off the mayor's war
against drugs. The program became a model for other cities,
including Miami, which began a similar campaign during the summer.
   Tampa's one-day followup operation also served as a buildup to a
meeting next month at which Mrs. Freedman plans to ask businesses
to pitch in financially and pledge dollars to continue the
crackdown.
   ``It's a continuous effort,'' she said. ``We've got to come up
with creative ways to deal with the problem.''
   The highly publicized event was not without its mishaps, as a
demolition worker suffered a broken leg when struck by a piece of
machinery.

   Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis has a slight edge over Vice President George Bush among
likely voters in New York state, according to a poll released
Monday.
   The Marist College Institute for Public Opinion reported that of
601 likely New York voters surveyed last week, 48 percent said they
favored Dukakis while 42 percent chose his Republican opponent. The
number of undecided stood at 10 percent.
   The results signal a statistical dead heat, given a margin of
error of 4 percent in the poll.
   In March, the Marist pollsters reported that 47 percent of New
Yorkers surveyed favored Dukakis, 41 percent preferred Bush and 12
percent were undecided.
   New York, a major battleground state with 36 electoral votes,
has been considered a Dukakis stronghold, because Democrats have a
3-2 lead in registration over Republicans and because Dukakis is
from neighboring Massachusetts.

<HEAD>Track Defects Go Unrepaired, Newspaper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's railroads are ignoring many track
defects reported by their inspectors, some of whom say they've been
ordered to falsify reports by noting only severest problems, The
Pittsburgh Press reported Monday.
   ``I walk the track in the terminal area, do my job, find defects
and put them on my reports, and I just get a world of hell from my
supervisors,'' said Paul Abbott, a track inspector for seven years
and now an assistant track foreman at Norfolk Southern's train
yards in Roanoke, Va.
   Abbott told the Press that as late as mid-August he found dozens
of serious defects in the Roanoke yards, ``far, far more than the
(Federal Railroad Administration) will permit,'' but was told not
to report the safety violations.
   The Press said Abbott's comments were representative of two
dozen inspectors from Conrail, CSX, Boston & Maine, Illinois
Central, Norfolk & Southern, Pittsburgh & Lake Erie and other
railroads who said their supervisors have ordered them to falsify
inspection reports.
   The defects Abbott cited included seven broken rails, six
mismatched rail joints and scores of rotten ties.
   Norfolk Southern spokesman Robert Aumen denied ``forcefully and
unequivocally'' that Abbott had ever been ordered to falsify
inspection reports.
   But on a tape recording, which the newspaper said Abbott made
and union representatives played for FRA inspectors, division
engineer William Schafer tells Abbott: ``All I'm asking you to do,
if you go out and find something, uh, that's an FRA defect that's
not going to cause any derailments, don't put it down on a piece of
paper. There's no way we're going to be able to fix all that.''
   Schafer told the newspaper he never ``instructed anyone to
ignore or overlook unsafe conditions.''
   ``I was trying to maintain this terminal, using good judgment
and the company's resources to its fullest benefit,'' Schafer said.
   Abbott's complaints led to a three-day FRA inspection that found
25 safety violations at the Roanoke yards two weeks ago. All the
defects were repaired, Schafer said last week.
   Top managers at all the railroads said track maintenance is not
being overlooked, but supervisors acknowledged that maintenance
commonly is deferred because of personnel and material shortages
and management's reluctance to take tracks out of service.
   ``Some railroads just don't care about their yards and won't
spend the money to make them safe,'' said William Mitchell, a
senior track inspector with the Ohio Public Utility Commission.
   ``My phone rings all the time with calls from Conrail track and
yard supervisors pleading with me to come and inspect their yards
so I can write up the defects. They say that my report is often the
only way management can be forced to give them a few thousand ties
or some switches or new rail they've been waiting for for months to
make their yards safe to use,'' he said.
   ``I'd say our yard tracks on Conrail are in pretty good shape
for the most part,'' countered Richard Hasselman, Conrail vice
president for operations.
   The newpaper also said that during its nine-month investigation,
it obtained a SOO Line inspection report compiled April 8, 1987,
that called for replacing 27 ties at the precise spot where nearly
a year later a 28-car derailment spewed hazardous chemicals into
the air and forced an evacuation of Annandale, Minn.
   The railroad said the accident occurred because the rails had
widened beyond their proper gauge. The 27 ties, a key to
maintaining proper gauge, never were replaced, the paper said.
   SOO spokesman John Bergene said the railroad's investigation did
not find the damaged ties to be a big factor in the accident and
that investigators have not determined why the rails spread.

   Vice President George Bush, who once trailed
Michael Dukakis by 10 percentage points in Ohio, is in a dead heat
with the Democratic nominee, according to a new poll of state
voters.
   Among 667 Ohio registered voters, 43 percent support Bush, 39
percent favor Dukakis and 18 percent are undecided, the University
of Akron poll said. The 4 percentage point margin of error means
the race is a statistical dead heat.
   Since last April, Dukakis has dropped 5 points, Bush has risen 9
points and the number of undecided voters declined 4 points.
   The poll, commissioned by The (Akron) Beacon Journal, WKYC-TV in
Cleveland and WCMH-TV in Columbus, was conducted between Sept. 6-15
and published Sunday.

   Police swarmed through gang-infested
territories and arrested nearly 900 people, half of them gang
members, but street violence raged with at least three dead and
nine wounded, authorities said.
    Nearly 400 officers arrested more than 360 people Saturday
night and early Sunday, police said. Officers brought in at least
510 people Friday night.
   ``Part of the purpose is the message to the gang members _ the
message to the community that we're here,'' Police Lt. Fred Nixon
said Sunday. ``We can show it's statistically significant also.''
   More than 200 people have died in gang-related killings in Los
Angeles County this year. Such homicides in the gang-plagued
community of south-central Los Angeles dropped 17 percent from
January through August, with a dramatic 50 percent decline in July
and August alone, according to figures released last week.
   The crackle of gunfire and spilled blood are a weekend ritual in
the grafitti-pocked neighborhoods staked out by street thugs. The
sweeps have been conducted periodically since April.
   This weekend's effort was concentrated south-central Los Angeles
and the San Fernando Valley. More than half those arrested were
suspected gang members, police said.
   The charges ranged from felony drug crimes to misdemeanors.
Police also wrote hundreds of traffic citations and confiscated 66
cars, eight guns, plus cocaine, marijuana, and $1,400 in cash, Sgt.
Larry Mazur said.
   The violence continued Sunday, when one reputed gang member was
slain and a bystander wounded in a drive-by shooting in the
south-central area, authorities said.
   In another gang-related incident Sunday, two suspected gang
members were stabbed and critically wounded during a fight in
Pomona, police said.
   Four males were arrested for investigation of attempted murder
in the brawl, said Sgt. Ron McDonald.
   Less than an hour after the sweeps ended in the San Fernando
Valley, a 22-year-old man was killed and one was wounded in a
drive-by shooting in suburban Sun Valley, police said.
   The motive wasn't known, but investigators said it was
gang-related.
   ``It appears at this time they were totally innocent,''
Detective Mike Coffey said of the victims. ``The car drove by and
for some reason fired shots at them.''
   Just before that attack, two gang members and an innocent
bystander were hit by shots fired from a passing car near the Los
Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Hospital officials refused to release
the victims' conditions.
   An attack Saturday night in the south-central area killed a
16-year-old boy and wounded a 17-year-old, said Lt. Dave Hepburn.
   Investigators said the killing may have resulted from a drug
deal gone bad.
   In another gang-related shooting, a 17-year-old Long Beach youth
riding his bicycle in south-central Los Angeles was wounded Sunday
evening by gunfire from a passing car. He was in stable condition,
said Sgt. Paul Hast.
   Earlier in the weekend, two reputed gang members were booked for
investigation of attempted murder in suburban Burbank after opening
fire on a crowd at a hamburger stand Friday night, Burbank Police
Sgt. Rick Madrid said.
   Officers who were watching the stand because of two other
drive-by shootings in the area during the past two weeks saw
several people limp away after the attack, but nobody reported an
injury to authorities, Madrid said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Clerical workers at New York University voted
Monday to approve a new contract and call off a three-week walkout,
the union said.
   ``It was definitely worth going out on strike,'' said Margarita
Aguilar, president of Local 3882 of the United Staff Association.
``We moved an institution from what they wanted to impose.''
   The strike began Aug. 29, the first day of fall registration at
the nation's largest private college. Most activities at the
college went on normally during the strike.
   Some workers returned to work for a half day Monday; the rest
return Tuesday.
   NYU spokesman Howard Levine said the agreement was reached
Sunday night after daylong talks held under the auspices of federal
mediator Vincent Watson.
   The agreement was presented to the members Monday morning and
they approved it overwhelmingly by secret ballot, Aguilar said. The
pact still must be ratified formally in a mail ballot.
   The union represents 1,500 filing clerks, receptionists and
secretaries who had been working without a contract since October
1987.
   Levine said the pact follows the pattern of 5.5 percent annual
wage increases given to other faculty and staff. ``It does give
additional money to the lower paid employees in the bargaining
unit,'' Levine said.
   Aguilar said about 900 people were eligible for that extra money.
   The major issue was the union's claim that its members,
predominantly women and minorities, earn an average of $17,500 a
year, $2,000 less than men in jobs with similar responsibilities,
such as porters, elevator operators and security guards.
   Because of that perceived disparity, the union rejected the
university's offer of 5.5 percent annual wage increases in each of
three years, saying it was nothing more than a cost of living
increase that did not address inequity.
   NYU implemented the first raise last year.
   Neither Levine nor Aguilar said how much extra money would be
available to those at the low end of the pay scale.
   The union was unable to get NYU approval for an agency shop,
which would require all the people who benefit from a contract to
contribute to the costs of negotiating it. Currently, only 900 of
the 1,500 eligible workers are dues-paying members of the union.
   But the union gained other improvements including in overtime
pay, pensions, life insurance and leaves of absence.

<TEXT>
   Soldiers loyal to the new military
government opened fire on thousands of demonstrators who surged
into the streets Monday to protest a military coup. About 100
people were reported killed in Rangoon.
   Demonstrations also broke out it other cities, including
Mandalay. Witnesses and other reports said a total of about 150
people, including 17 soldiers, had died in the violence that swept
Burma after Sunday's coup.
   The military placed the death toll at 23 Monday, but gave no
details.
   Military commander Saw Maung engineered the newest change in
power in Burma by overthrowing civilian President Maung Maung.
   Undaunted opposition leaders vowed that students, Buddhist monks
and striking civil servants would continue to demonstrate for
democracy.
   Maung Maung's whereabouts remain unknown.
   A Western diplomat familiar with Burma said from Bangkok,
Thailand, that ``We're into possibly one of the final acts now ...
a naked confrontation with the army. ... Either the students win or
the army wins.''
   The soldiers were trying to enforce a ban on public gatherings
imposed immediately after the coup by Saw Maung, the defense
minister before the coup and a right-hand man of former President
Sein Lwin. Sein Lwin resigned Aug. 12 after riots in which hundreds
of protesters reportedly died.
   Protesters blame the country's sole legal party, the ruling
Burma Socialist Program Party, for 26 years of repression and
economic ruin. Other analysts believe the military may have acted
to simply assert its traditional authority.
   Reports indicated soldiers shot at mostly unarmed protesters
near the main government administrative building, the U.S. Embassy,
Sule Pagoda and Rangoon General Hospital. An Asian diplomat said 67
people were admitted Monday at Rangoon General Hospital.
   Witnesses said corpses were taken away by military trucks while
residents dragged some of the dead and wounded into their houses or
put them in three-wheeled taxis to be taken to hospitals.
   In Washington, the Reagan administration said it was reviewing
assistance programs to Burma that total $14 million annually to
determine whether aid should be cut off in light of the coup and
violence.
   ``The United States urges Burmese military authorities
immediately to cease shooting at demonstrators and calls upon those
demonstrating to refrain from provocative actions,'' White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Military spokesman Kyaw Sann said the clashes began Sunday night
when ``the violent mob attacked security forces with catapaults and
jinglees (metal darts) and the troops had to disperse the mob by
shooting in many parts of the town.''
   Kyaw Sann said crowds Monday raided two police stations,
stealing rifles, pistols and ammunition. There were reports
protesters, some carrying swords, spears and crossbows, were taking
the weapons of fallen soldiers.
   Troops used cranes and forklifts to clear roadblocks
demonstrators had erected. Witnesses said one boy was killed and
six people were wounded when troops fired on youths trying to
remove a tree that had been used as a barrier.
   ``Many students are being mowed down. Can't anything be done?''
a reporter said by telephone from the scene of one confrontation
before begining to cry.
   Witnesses said they also saw two monks fall to the ground after
being hit by bullets near Sule Pagoda.
   In the past month, strikes, demonstrations, looting and
lawlessness have paralyzed the economy and pushed the nation to the
verge of anarchy. Saw Maung in a statement to Radio Rangoon vowed
to restore order and to ``hold general elections under a multiparty
system'' at an unspecified later date.
   Opposition leaders said on Monday they would ``continue our
struggle for democracy by various means until the goal is
achieved.'' A joint statement was issued by former military
officers Aung Gyi and Tin Oo and Aung San Suu Kyi, the daughter of
the late independence hero Aung San.
   Troops at one point fired Monday on a crowd outside the U.S.
Embassy in Rangoon, said the embassy's public affairs officer, John
Fredenburg.
   ``It wasn't fighting between the troops and the demonstrators _
it was really more troops firing on the demonstrators,'' Fredenburg
told Associated Press Radio.
   ``There was a small group of young people outside the embassy,
not demonstrating, but waiting outside the embassy. And further
down the street there was a group of people marching. ...
   ``They were as far as we could tell unarmed and behaving in a
peaceful manner. The troops opened fire on that group of
demonstrators and then opened fire on the small group of a hundred
or so people that were standing in front of the embassy at the same
time.
   ``The procession of demonstrators may have numbered one to two
thousand. ``When the firing died down and the ambulance came to
pick up the casualties, there were two people who appeared to have
been killed and there was one wounded still lying in front of the
embassy _ a young man who was shot in the upper body and was quite
bloody.''
   Maung Maung on Aug. 19 became the nation's first civilian leader
since the 1962 military coup by strongman Ne Win. Ne Win resigned
in July after protests against his repressive rule.

<HEAD>Hurricane Halts Pickers From Reaching Apple Crop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARTINSBURG, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hurricane Gilbert's damage to
Jamaica's airports is preventing apple pickers from getting to West
Virginia orchards, threatening the crop.
   ``It's going to be devastating,'' said Douglas Dirting, vice
president of Tri-County Growers Inc., which normally has 400 people
in the fields during mid-September. On Monday, there were fewer
than 15, he said.
   Dirting said the Jamaicans may arrive Friday, but by then 72,000
bushels of apples will have dropped to the ground.
   Tri-County also blames the U.S. Labor Department for its
troubles.
   Labor Department Region III Administrator William Haltigan last
month denied the company's certification to hire foreign workers
until it settled a legal dispute with two former workers, Dirting
said.
   The lawsuit and the bureaucratic delays were finally resolved by
last week _ just as the hurricane tore through Jamaica.
   Tri-County hired 40 Jamaicans who had been in Connecticut
cutting tobacco, but they barely will make a dent in the apple crop
this week, Dirting said.
   ``When (apples) hit the ground, most of the time the processing
companies won't even want to buy them for juice,'' he said.
   Tri-County gets $8 to $10 per bushel for high-quality apples,
but juice-quality apples fetch only about $1.50 per bushel, company
officials said.
   The growers have had little luck in finding domestic labor to
pick the apples. Tri-County recruited just three local pickers.

<TEXT>
   Armenians and Azerbaijanis armed with rifles and
handguns battled in a new outbreak of violence in the disputed
region of the Caucasus, and the Tass new agency reported Monday
that 25 people were injured.
   The shootout over the weekend in a village in the enclave of
Nagorno-Karabakh marked an escalation of tensions that have been
flaring between the two ethnic groups.
   The ethnic strife over the last seven months has been a
challenge for Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   In addition to the violent clash, a series of general strikes
was reported in Armenia and in Nagorno-Karabakh, a mostly Armenian
area that has been part of the republic of Azerbaijan since 1923.
   The official news agency said demonstrators left a rally Sunday
in the main city of Nagorno-Karabakh, Stepanakert, for the nearby
village of Khadzhaly, and when they arrived clashes broke out.
   ``Firearms and sidearms were used in mass-scale fights on both
sides,'' Tass reported from Stepanakert. ``As a result, 25 people
received injuries of various degress of gravity and 17 were
hospitalized. Both Armenians and Azerbaijanis applied for medical
assistance.''
   An editor for the Tass affiliate in the Armenian capital of
Yerevan, however, said by telephone that Azerbaijanis were the only
ones carrying firearms and that 19 of those injured were Armenians,
four seriously. He said 150 of the demonstrators had marched to
Khadzhaly.
   The editor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
clashes were touched off by reports of earlier disturbances in the
village between Armenians and Azerbaijanis.
   Demonstrators were holding a rally in Stepanakert when Armenians
arrived from Khadzhaly with reports that Azerbaijanis had stoned a
busload of Armenians on Saturday, the editor said. He said an
unknown number of Armenians was injured in those disturbances.
   The Armenians who returned to Stepanakert stoned Azerbaijani
houses in the city, breaking windows, according to the journalist.
   In Yerevan, the mother of long-time Armenian activist Mofses
Gorgisyan said rumors were flying of a much higher injury toll. She
spoke of rumors that 17 people were killed and that 60 to 70
Armenians had been injured.
   Alisa Gorgisyan and the Tass editor said thousands of Armenians
rallied in Yerevan on Monday night to protest the incident.
   ``All the city is on its feet, walking, shouting,'' she said.
   She and the Tass editor said the protesters were demanding a
meeting of the republic's parliament, the Supreme Soviet. The
editor said the body's executive committee, scheduled a session for
Tuesday to consider whether to convene a full session of the
Supreme Soviet.
   Alisa Gorgisyan said a strike that began Friday in Yerevan was
continuing, but the Tass editor denied there was any work stoppage
in the republic. He acknowledged, however, that a strike was
continuing in Stepanakert.
   The Stepanakert walkout was reported to have begun Sept. 12 and
had been scheduled to end Sunday but was extended after the
violence, the Tass editor said.
   In its dispatch, Tass said without elaborating that police were
taking steps to restore order and that the prosecutor had started a
criminal investigation into the clashes.
   The regional parliament of Nagorno-Karabakh has banned further
rallies and marches, Tass reported.
   Armenians launched a campaign in February to have
Nagorno-Karabakh transferred from Azerbaijan and annexed to Armenia.
   Armenians, who make up 76 percent of Nagorno-Karabakh's
population of 162,000, are predominantly Christian and also differ
linguistically and culturally from ethnic Azerbaijanis. Most
Azerbaijanis are Shiite Moslem.
   The weekend violence was the second instance of major clashes
since the annexation campaign began. At least 32 people, 26
Armenians and six Azerbaijanis, were killed in three days of
rioting that began Feb. 28 in the Azerbaijani Caspian Sea port of
Sumgait.
   In July, central authorities in Moscow rejected the annexation
demand and instead approved a plan to redress Armenians' grievances
of poor housing, hospitals, schools and Armenian cultural
facilities in Nagorno-Karabakh.

<HEAD>Soviets Again Say Wallenberg Died in Prison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Monday that Raoul Wallenberg,
the Swedish diplomat credited with saving 100,000 Hungarian Jews
from the Nazis, died 41 years ago in a Soviet prison and was
cremated without an autopsy.
   Gennady I. Gerasimov, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said at a
briefing that Wallenberg died in July 1947. He did not give the
exact date of death.
   A 1957 search of documents at Lubyanka Prison in central Moscow
turned up a note written by the medical service officer about his
orders from state security chief Viktor Abakumov, Gerasimov said.
Abakumov later ran afoul of dictator Josef Stalin and was executed.
   ``Reported personally to the minister. The body ordered to be
cremated without a post mortem. July 17, 1947,'' the note said,
according to Gerasimov.
   Gerasimov said the chief medical officer, whom he identified
only as Smoltsov, had handwritten his report on Wallenberg's death.
   ``Prisoner Wallenberg died in his cell last night, presumably of
myocardial infarction (heart attack),'' Smoltsov's report said.
   Gerasimov raised the topic of Wallenberg's death without
prompting from reporters. He said the issue had been broached
Friday in Vienna by representatives of the United States, Canada,
Great Britain, Sweden, Switzerland and Hungary at a conference on
European security.
   ``He was arrested in 1945 in Budapest,'' Gerasimov said. ``Since
then we answered a lot of questions about his fate, but up to now
we hear news and we still hear questions, even here.''
   Despite Soviet insistence that he died in prison in 1947,
reports have persistently surfaced that Wallenberg had been seen in
Soviet prison camps.
   Swedish author Kenne Fant, in a recently released book on
Wallenberg, said he had spoken to ``a very trustworthy source'' who
heard of a prisoner who must have been Wallenberg. Fant said the
prisoner was seen in 1986 in the labor camp Blagoveshchenka, a
closed city 200 miles southwest of Novosibirisk.
   Fant also cited sources in the United States who said Wallenberg
was treated for a heart ailment in hospitals in Leningrad and
Moscow in 1982 and 1983.
   Many Swedes have refused to accept Soviet accounts of
Wallenberg's death as a final answer, even though Soviet officials
continually denounce claims that he is alive.
   Gerasimov said he knew no other details about Wallenberg's death
or arrest.
   ``As to the reasons for his arrest, they are unknown to us.
Please remember that these were Abakumov's times,'' he said.
   Wallenberg arrived in Budapest in July 1944, on a U.S.-sponsored
mission to save Jews. He disappeared after the Red Army swept into
the Hungarian capital in January 1945.
   ``In its time, the Soviet government expressed sincere regrets
as to what happened and also expressed deep condolences to the
Swedish government and to the family and relatives of Wallenberg,''
Gerasimov said.

   The State Department on Monday criticized last
week's reported renewed fighting by Algeria-backed Polisario
guerrillas in the Western Sahara and urged all sides to support
United Nations peace proposals.
   ``The Sept. 16 attack by Polisario forces harms the efforts of
U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar to develop a formula
for peaceful resolution of the Western Sahara problem,'' spokesman
Charles Redman told reporters.
   ``We call upon the parties to cooperate with the Secretary
General's efforts, which the United States has consistently
supported,'' he added.
   Spain ended colonial rule in 1975 over the sparsely-settled
desert territory and it was annexed by Morocco over the opposition
of Polisario, an independence movement backed by Algeria, Morocco's
eastern neighbor.
   Polisario and Morocco agreed conditionally late last month to a
plan for a U.N.-supervised cease-fire followed by a referendum on
the territory's future.

   An American stockbroker asked Soviets
on Monday why their shops are low on supplies. A Soviet journalist
accused a well-known U.S. colleague of trying to teach Russians how
to live.
   Showing the candor the Soviets now seek in their relations with
Americans, as well as the disagreements that still divide the
superpowers, a six-day meeting of 500 citizens from both countries
began Monday in this southern Soviet city near the Turkish-Iranian
border.
   It is the fourth annual encounter co-sponsored by the
state-sanctioned U.S.-Soviet Friendship Society and the Chautauqua
Institution of New York. About 300 Americans, from Apollo 11
astronaut Michael Collins to Broadway songster Tommy Tune, came to
Tbilisi for the conference.
   In past years the conference served as a reliable barometer of
U.S.-Soviet relations. Thirteen months ago in Chautauqua, N.Y., the
Soviet delegation trumpeted the merits of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
drive for greater openness.
   In 1986, the meeting was held at the Latvian Baltic Sea resort
of Jurmala, but the festive mood was soured by the KGB's arrest
days before of U.S. journalist Nicholas Daniloff in Moscow.
   With four superpower summits and an unprecedented agreement
between Moscow and Washington to destroy their shorter- and
medium-range nuclear weapons now history, the mood was decidedly
upbeat as the meeting began in this capital of Soviet Georgia,
1,000 miles south of Moscow.
   ``Probably everyone, even those who are not specialists in
Soviet-American relations, is amazed at the changes that have taken
place in the last three to four years,'' deputy Foreign Minister
Anatoly L. Adamishin told the conference.
   Because of the greater heed paid by the Gorbachev-era Kremlin to
Soviet public opinion, Adamishin said, it was important for
citizens of both superpowers to understand each other.
   The Soviets, showing the importance they place on the meeting,
sent Gorbachev's science advisor, Yevgeny Velikhov; top foreign
policy commentator Alexander Bovin; and Col. Gen. Nikolai Chervov
of the Soviet General Staff.
   The Americans included official government representatives such
as deputy assistant Secretary of State Thomas W. Simons Jr. Also
attending were many private citizens who paid $3,500 to take part.
   ``We will have differences of opinion as the week unfolds, but
we came in goodwill seeking common ground,'' Hedrick Smith, a
syndicated columnist who was once the New York Times bureau chief
in Moscow, told Monday's opening session.
   In question-and-answer sessions, Americans voiced concern over
Soviet human rights practices, including limits on travel and
emigration and the banning of some books.
   Soviets asked the Americans why their trade union
representatives were sometimes barred from getting U.S. visas and
why the United States has not agreed to a long-standing Kremlin
call for a ban on nuclear tests.
   The sharpest exchanges came in a stuffy hall at the headquarters
of Georgia's Znamya Society, where 300 people met to hear two
Soviet and two American panelists discuss how each country views
the other.
   ``You fellows have walked the streets of Paris and other Western
capitals. When you see that in the main street of Leningrad,
there's basically nothing in the stores, how do you explain that?''
Dale McBrier, 34, a stockbroker from Erie, Pa., asked the Soviet
panel members.
   ``My dear American friend,'' answered Bovin. ``I wish you could
read the current issues of Izvestia or any other newspaper. I
assure you there are critical articles there. Unfortunately, your
society has not caught up with the criticism.''
   The portly Bovin, who appears frequently on Soviet television,
accused his fellow panelist, Smith, of ``attempting to teach us how
to live'' by critical remarks made in Smith's recent book ``The
Russians.''
   ``I hate to disappoint Mr. Bovin, but the book was not written
to instruct Soviet citizens since it was published in English and
not in Russian,'' Smith replied. Soviet customs guards still
routinely confiscate copies of ``The Russians'' if they find it in
Western travelers' luggage.
   A Soviet from Togliatti told the meeting the local branch of the
U.S.-Soviet Friendship Society needed permission from local
Communist Party and government officials to meet, and that
sometimes they have been told, ``No, it's too early now. You will
have no peace cruises or meetings until next May.''
   Panels on arms control, human rights and women in society are
scheduled before the conference adjourns Saturday. More than 120 of
the Americans are being put up by Georgians in their homes, a new
facet of the program that both Soviet and American participants say
is proving to be one of the most rewarding.

<HEAD>Pilot Says He's Thankful So Many Survived Crash, Grieves For Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pilot of Delta Air Lines Flight
1141, which crashed on takeoff last month, says he grieves for the
14 people who died but is grateful that 94 people survived the
accident.
   ``I'm so thankful for all those people who were able to get
out,'' Capt. Larry Davis said. ``I felt like when impact began,
that we were all dead.''
   ``I think God saved us from death,'' Davis, 48, told the Fort
Worth Star-Telegram in an interview published Monday.
   Davis said there was no time to pray before the Boeing 727 went
down Aug. 31 at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.
   ``Everything happened in 11 seconds and I was totally occupied
with the airplane during that time,'' Davis said at his home south
of Greenville, about 40 miles northeast of Dallas.
   ``At times, I experienced great grief over the people that died
in the accident,'' he said. ``I still have a lot of grief over
that, and I have to admit that to the world.''
   Davis' jaw remains wired shut from facial injuries he sustained,
and he also suffered back injuries. He cannot eat solid food
because of his wired jaw wires, but he said the bands should come
off soon.
   Davis said although he already has been served papers for a
lawsuit filed in connection with the crash, he is confident God
will see him through.
   ``I feel like the Lord is definitely in control of everything
that is taking place and that is going to take place,'' he said.
``I pray that the truth will be known.''
   He would not comment on the cause of the crash when contacted
Monday by The Associated Press.
   Some, including the Greenville City Council, have praised Davis
because so many people survived the accident.
   But Davis says he didn't do anything out of the ordinary.
   ``I think every Delta pilot would do the same thing,'' he said.
``You do everything you can.''

<HEAD>Pope Ends Africa Trip Decrying Poverty And Apartheid</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II returned home Monday from a 10-day
trip to southern African after urging war-stricken Mozambique to
find peace with South Africa and calling for an end to racial
discrimination.
   But South African clergymen who met the pontiff at the end of
his pilgrimage said he should have spoken out more forcefully
against apartheid.
   John Paul's 49th foreign trip, which took him to five nations,
was marked by a forced landing in South Africa, a deadly bus
hijacking in Lesotho and a papal appeal for aid to victims of
Mozambique's drought and civil war.
   In a misty-eyed departure speech at Maputo Airport in
Mozambique, the pope decried the ``scandalous poverty'' of the
region and the ``painful violations of elementary rights of each
man,'' a reference to South Africa's racial policies.
   Speaking of the hunger in Mozambique, the pope described ``the
worried gaze of so many children, the uncertain look of so many
youths (and) the weary eyes of so many adults.''
   He also appealed to ``all those who have political
responsibilities'' in the region to settle their differences
peacefully.
   Six days before the pope visited Mozambique, South African
President P.W. Botha held a surprise meeting with his Mozambique
counterpart, Joaquim Chissano, to revive a 1984 non-aggression pact
and jointly develop energy sources and tourism.
   Chissano, a Marxist, said the pope had seen for himself ``the
signs of good will to overcome the crisis.''
   Civil war has left 6 million of Mozambique's 14.5 million people
in need of foreign food aid, and John Paul said he felt ``the heart
of the people bleed.''
   ``This nation needs assistance from other peoples ... to save a
large amount of human lives,'' the pope said.
   Activist clergymen from South Africa, who on Monday attended a
papal Mass in Mozambique, said John Paul should have spoken out
more forcefully against apartheid during his tour of the region.
   On Wednesday, John Paul made an unscheduled stop in South
Africa, where his plane was diverted in bad weather, forcing him to
travel by road to Lesotho.
   The pope ``had given the South African government more comfort
than it deserved,'' said the Rev. Allan Boesak, president of the
World Alliance of Reformed Churches. He spoke to reporters after he
and other Protestant clergy from South Africa joined Mozambican
church leaders at a meeting with John Paul.
   During his pilgrimage, John Paul condemned all violence, but
suggested he was not enthusiastic about anti-apartheid strategies
such as economic sanctions and election boycotts.
   Boesak said the three-hour papal stop in Johannesburg was a
propaganda coup for South African authorities, who had complained
about the omission of their country from the official itinerary.
   South Africa's foreign minister, Pik Botha, greeted the pope,
ordered a security force escort for a motorcade to Lesotho, and
later boasted about South Africa's hospitality.
   ``Anyone who enters into dialogue with the South African
government must be aware that they are going to use you for their
own purposes,'' Boesak said.
   One of Boesak's colleagues, the Rev. Frank Chikane, said the
pope had met with officials who ``hurt us and cause us pain'' and
had been escorted by ``people who torture us.''
   Chikane is secretary general of the South African Council of
Churches, which is leading a civil disobedience campaign
challenging emergency regulations and apartheid laws.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs, which are controlled by the 5 million whites.
   During his nine-hour return flight to Rome, John Paul sent his
first public message in at least five years to Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi, whose country has no diplomatic relations with the
Vatican.
   The pope, who flew over the Libyan coastal city of Benghazi,
sent a telegram extending ``good wishes for the peace and
well-being of the peoples of the Jamahiriya,'' the name the
government has used for Libya since Gadhafi took power in a 1969
coup.
   The pontiff began his trip in Zimbabwe, where he attended a
conference of southern African bishops. Just before the papal plane
landed in Botswana, topless women dancing at the airport in
Gabarone were told to cover themselves.
   In Swaziland, the pope stressed the virtues of monogamy at a
Mass attended by 20-year-old King Mswati II and three of his four
wives.
   The pope's visit to tiny Lesotho was the most dramatic of his
pilgrimage. The night before he arrived, rebels hijacked a
pilgrims' bus carrying nuns and schoolchildren to see the pope. Six
people were killed when South African soldiers stormed the bus to
end the 27-hour ordeal.

   An airline passenger abandoned about $1
million in cocaine aboard a jetliner Monday and fled during a stop
at the Indianapolis International Airport, police said.
   Police Sgt. Bobby J. Flowers said the cocaine weighed more than
7 pounds and has a street value of $1 million. It was found about
6:15 a.m. in a gray bag aboard a USAir flight from Los Angeles to
Pittsburgh with a stop in Indianapolis.
   The passenger was scheduled to continue on to Pittsburgh, but as
the jet left the terminal, a flight attendant noticed the luggage
on the seat where the man had been sitting.
   Worried the bag might contain a bomb, the attendant notified the
pilot and the plane returned to the gate, Flowers said.
   Airport police Officer Charles Hasselburg opened the bag and
found it contained four large and six small bags of a white
substance and $6,945 in cash. The money was stuffed a pair of
sneakers, police said.
   Flowers said a test confirmed the substance was cocaine.
   Before leaving the airport, the passenger had gone to the USAir
ticket counter where workers said he acted suspiciously and seemed
nervous.

<HEAD>Poll Finds Americans Unsure About Immigrants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most Americans continue to believe immigrants
have a negative impact on the economy and little to contribute to
U.S. culture, according to a Los Angeles Times Poll published
Monday.
   Attitudes toward immigrants, which historically have not been
welcoming, have remained unchanged in spite of two years of
unprecedented attention during the government's amnesty and
employer sanction programs, the Times said.
   Experts, government officials and immigrant advocates said they
were disappointed that immigration reforms haven't altered the
situation.
   ``A lot of our old prejudices are still at work,'' said Maurice
A. Roberts, editor of Interpreter Releases, a Washington-based
national immigration journal.
   Despite extensive publicity about the 1986 immigration reform
law, a large part of the population is not aware of the
government's efforts, according to the Times Poll. But among those
familiar with the changes, the public generally approves the
legalization of about 2 million immigrants while giving low marks
to the early effectiveness of employer sanctions.
   The Times Poll was conducted four months after the one-year
legalization program ended and two months after the federal
Immigration and Naturalization Service began full enforcement of
sanctions against employers who knowingly hire illegal workers.
   The poll, directed by I.A. Lewis, was conducted by a nationwide
telephone survey of 1,418 respondents last weekend. The margin of
error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
   Figures don't add up to 100 percent because the poll excluded
those who didn't have a clear opinion.
   Asked if immigrants get more from the U.S economy through social
services and unemployment benefits or contribute more through taxes
and work, 64 percent said that immigrants take more than they give.
Only 19 percent said immigrants contributed more, while four
percent said immigrants benefitted and contributed equally to the
economy.
   Asked if immigrants have made a contribution in the last decade
to American culture, 46 percent said they haven't, while 40 percent
said immigrants have enriched the culture.
   Most experts and officials said the poll results were not
unexpected. They say it is reflective of anti-immigrant opinions in
a country of immigrants.
   ``The fact is that the country tends to have unwelcoming
attitudes, but at the same time they're ambivalent because of their
own immigrant backgrounds,'' said Charles Kamasaki of the National
Council of La Raza, a Washington-based Hispanic rights organization.

<TEXT>
   Representatives of the Nicaraguan
government met with rebel leaders Monday for the first time in
three months, but both sides remained sharply divided on ways to
end seven years of civil war.
   The leftist Sandinista government and the U.S.-backed rebels,
known as Contras, began a two-day conference as a preliminary step
to resuming the high-level peace talks that collapsed on June 9.
   The rebels recently proposed that high-level talks resume Sept.
26, but the two sides disagree on a location.
   Nicaragua is willing to resume talks, but they must be held in
Managua, Victor Hugo Tinoco, Nicaraguan assistant foreign minister
and the head of the Sandinista delegation, said at a news
conference before Monday's meeting.
   The rebels have opposed holding the talks in the Nicaraguan
capital and have said high-level negotiations cannot resume until
the government releases more than 40 anti-government demonstrators
arrested in July.
   A fragile March 21 cease-fire remains in effect in Nicaragua,
but each side accuses the other of violating the truce.
   Tinoco said he expected the Guatemala meeting to result in ``a
cease-fire for 30 or 60 days that could be extended indefinitely.''
   Both sides agreed on March 23 to seek a negotiated settlement to
the conflict the government says has claimed the lives of 28,000
Nicaraguans.
   The agreement called on the rebels to lay down their arms in
exchange for democratic reforms. Shortly before peace talks broke
off in June, the Sandinistas proposed a timetable for disarmament
and political reforms.
   But the Contras rejected the plan, saying it did not go far
enough. They demanded freedom for political prisoners and
democratic reforms in Nicaragua.
   Tinoco said the Sandinistas will urge that a cease-fire
verification commission funded by $10 million from congress be put
into operation. Commission members would include the
secretary-general of the Organization of American States, Joao
Baena Soares, and Nicaraguan Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo. Tinoco
also reiterated the government's demand that the Contras free 66
prisoners of war being held in Honduras.
   He blamed the Contras for ending peace talks on June 9. ``The
Contras broke them off to seek military aid in the United States
Congress,'' he said.
   Direct U.S. military aid to the rebels ended Feb. 29, and the
Contras have few bargaining chips left. Non-lethal U.S. aid to the
Contras is distributed only in Honduras.
   During the past four months, most of the rebel forces fled back
to base camps inside Honduras to receive new supplies of uniforms
and food.
   Contra sources say only 2,000 fighters remain inside Nicaragua
while more than 9,000 are holed up in isolated camps in eastern
Honduras.
   The cease-fire pact in March caused deep divisions within the
rebel ranks. Militant Contras, led by Enrique Bermudez, a former
colonel under the deposed Anastasio Somoza dictatorship, said the
agreement was tantamount to surrender.

   Fifty-one pre-Columbian artifacts smuggled out of
Peru in furniture shipments have been seized in Miami, Customs
officials said Monday. Some of the pieces were 1,000 years old and
worth up to $5,000, they said.
   The cache included pieces of pottery, textiles and wooden items,
which were displayed at a news conference by authorities. They
called it the biggest seizure of antiquities here in recent memory,
and said arrests were expected in the case.
   ``We haven't determined the value,'' said Ken Stroud, head of
the Customs fraud unit. ``But some pieces run from $1,000 up to
$5,000 _ it depends on who's doing the buying.''
   Some of the items were 1,000 years old, according to an
evaluation by the Lowe Museum here, and Peruvian archaeologists
were expected to arrive soon to further identify the artifacts.
   All the pieces had been stamped by the Peruvian government,
showing they were legally registered under that nation's laws,
which forbid exporting antiquities.
   ``If it's removed from Peru, it was either smuggled out or
stolen first and smuggled out,'' Stroud said.
   The artifacts were found in July and August by Miami
International Airport inspectors making routine searches of
Challenge Air flights for drugs, Stroud said. They were hidden
inside furniture shipped here from Lima, Peru. Some of the pottery
had been painted in garish colors to make it look modern.
   Stroud said the airline was not implicated and had cooperated
fully with Customs authorities.
   ``We feel we're getting very close'' to making arrests in the
case, Stroud said. ``We just have a few loose ends to tie up.''
   He said the artifacts were most likely destined for private
collecters, because museums are aware of the legal restrictions in
Peru.
   Customs delayed announcing the seizures while the case was under
investigation, but decided to go public in part because they feared
the pieces would deteriorate in the humid warehouse where they were
stored, Stroud said.
   He said Customs was in contact with the Peruvian Embassy on
Monday to make arrangements to return the antiquities under a
treaty the United States has with that country.

   An impoverished woman ``adopted'' by a
businessman who was then besieged by creditors says she is turning
her life around now that social workers have helped her land a job
and day care.
   James Gisclair promised to ``adopt'' Anita Hunter, 28, and her
five children, move them from a Miami slum, and provide child care
and a job.
   But news coverage of Gisclair's promises brought creditors who
besieged the Boca Raton businessman for payments and pressed him
into court.
   Gisclair did move the Hunters from their hovel-like home and put
them in an apartment here, but because of transportation and
day-care problems, Ms. Hunter said she wound up without work and
with little food for her children.
   Then the state Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services
learned of her plight and moved quickly Friday to help.
   ``It was obvious that she was a motivated woman. She was a prime
candidate for Project Independence,'' said department spokesman Cam
Freedlund. The project offers recipients child care, transportation
to a job and federal rent subsidies.
   ``It's like Jim (Gisclair) started it and HRS finished it,''
said Ms. Hunter, who went to work in an HRS office. ``They finished
the job for him. Everything really has turned out for the best.''
   Meanwhile, 43-year-old Gisclair is scheduled for sentencing Nov.
3 in federal court on a bank fraud charge stemming from a $1.5
million civil judgment. He faces up to two years in prison.

   Some towns regulate the size of

   Rockville Centre wants to lord over a common lawn fixture _
``For Sale'' signs.
   Officials call the signs ugly.
   A proposed ordinance would impose a $300 monthly fee on such
signs, to be paid by the homeowner.
   In addition, the ordinance would allow only one sign per
property, limit the sign's size to 3 feet by 3 feet and require
that the sign sit 30 feet from the curb.
   Mayor Eugene Murray says the intent is not to do away with the
signs or to collect money for the village. He says officials want
to improve the quality of the signs and preserve the village's
appearance.
   The village must hold a public hearing on the proposal. Murray
said lawyers for the village are drafting the changes.

   Moisture from the remains of hurricane Gilbert combined with a
cold front Monday to produce rain over the central part of the
nation, and rain also was scattered over the Northwest.
   Showers and thunderstorms were over much of the lower Ohio
Valley and parts of the upper Great Lakes region and the upper
Mississippi Valley.
   A few showers and thunderstorms were over southern Missouri and
northern Arkansas, and showers lingered over eastern sections of
Nebraska and the Dakotas. High wind caused some tree damage in the
Chesterfield area of West St. Louis County, Mo.
   Fayetteville, Ark., got 1.55 inches of rain in the six hours up
to 2 p.m. EDT.
   A few showers and thunderstorms developed were over the southern
Atlantic Coast states. Charleston, S.C., got 1.12 inches of rain in
the six hours up to 2 p.m.
   Showers also developed ahead of a cold front crossing the
northern Pacific Coast region, and were scattered across the
Pacific Northwest into the northern Rocky Mountain region.
   Temperatures remained in the 40s in the northern Rockies, and
record lows for the date included 20 at Alamosa, Colo.; 23 at
Milford, Utah; and 22 at Richfield, Utah.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 43
degrees at Cutbank, Mont., to 94 at Chandler, Ariz. Monday
morning's low was 10 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Tuesday, scattered showers and thunderstorms, developing
ahead of a cold front, were forecast across much of the area from
the central and eastern Gulf Coast to the Great Lakes region and
the northern Atlantic Coast states. Scattered showers were forecast
along another cold front from Montana to western Utah and eastern
Nevada.
   Highs only in the 50s were predicted in western Montana and near
Lake Superior; below 70 across much of the area from the northern
Great Basin of Nevada and western Utah and Pacific Northwest to the
upper Great Lakes; above 80 from the central valleys of California
through southern Arizona and across the southern Plains to the
southern and middle Atlantic Coast; and in the 90s in the desert
Southwest, from south-central Texas to the central Gulf Coast
states, and across southern and central Florida.

   A man who pleaded guilty to dropping 66
ground nitroglycerin tablets into his grandmother's coffee was
placed Monday on three years' probation and ordered to undergo
psychiatric evaluation.
   Superior Court Commissioner Irwin Garfinkel imposed the sentence
on Alfred Sevilla, 23, who plead guilty last month to one count of
mingling a harmful substance with food or drink.
   Deputy District Attorney Nikola Mikulicich said he had asked
Garfinkel to order a psychatric evaluation before sentencing and
was disappointed the judge imposed probation before Sevilla was
evaluated.
   ``I don't know if he's a danger to others or not,'' Mikulicich
said. ``I wanted more information.''
   Sevilla faced a maximum of five years in prison.
   The results of Sevilla's evaluation will be given to the court
and the probation department, the prosecutor said. It will be
determined then whether he will be required to undergo counseling.
   Irma Rangel, 67 reported finding crushed, broken and whole pills
in a coffee jar when she started to prepare a cup. No one suffered
any ill effects from the tampering.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Monday signed a compromise
version of a Democratic-sponsored measure to bolster the
government's emergency food programs.
   The measure authorizes expenditures of $1.648 billion over a
three-year period.
   Reagan made no comment in signing the bill, which increases
funds for federal programs providing food stamps, school
breakfasts, child care food and summer food programs.
   A White House aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
bill resulted from a bipartisan agreement by a House-Senate
conference committee and was considered much more acceptable than
the original Democratic proposal.
   The bill extends for two years the Temporary Emergency Food
Assistance Program, under which surplus food is made available to
states for distribution to the needy.
   It also increases food stamp benefit levels and assistance under
the school breakfast and child care food programs. It authorizes
demonstration projects on nutrition.
   The food stamp program was started under President Kennedy in
1961. There now are 18.6 million recipients.
   The bill authorizes $50 million annually for the distribution to
the needy of corn, wheat and other surplus commodities.

   A small stream coursing through a
mangled landscape of twisted metal and crumbled concrete home was
all that remained Monday of the furious flood spawned by Hurricane
Gilbert.
   Although the waters receded, the human cost of the calamity
continued to rise. Hundreds sifted through the muck to salvage
possessions. Thousands spent another day in shelters for the
homeless. Workers still dug for bodies.
   More than 100 people have been confirmed dead in this industrial
center, which is still stunned by the sudden, storm-whipped rebirth
Saturday of the Santa Catarina River. The river, dry for decades,
became a savage torrent 10 feet deep and 150 yards wide.
   ``We just got three blankets out and lost everything else,''
said Ramona Carrizales Lopez, sitting outside a shelter for the
homeless.
   Mrs. Lopez was among thousands of people who had built meager
homes in the bone-dry riverbed that cuts through the most populated
region of northern Mexico.
   Hurricane Gilbert brought ferocious winds and up to 12 inches of
rain as it tore northwest through the Gulf of Mexico, pushing up
against the 14,000-foot mountains that ring this Nuevo Leon state
capital of 2.8 million people.
   The Santa Catarina riverbed suddenly swelled with water that
swept away entire ramshackle communities, miles of roads and a
sprawling sports complex that had been built on the riverbed.
   Four buses and other vehicles were dragged into the torrent. Bus
passengers are presumed to comprise most of the more than 100
people confirmed dead, and officials said many are still missing.
   The Nuevo Leon state government said a ``considerable number''
of people were missing and 30,000 people were lodged in shelters
around the state.
   Gilbert, ironically, did its worst damage on an inland city at a
time when the storm was at one of its weakest points.
   On Monday, the Santa Catarina River was only a 15-foot-wide
stream. Scores of people lined the banks, digging with their hands
to salvage what they could.
   Maria Costa, her husband and their six children lived on the
riverbed in a two-room home made of concrete blocks and tin. Their
clothing, furniture and new school books were washed away.
   ``We went yesterday to see it but there wasn't a thing to save.
Even the blocks were gone,'' said Mrs. Costa, 30, as she washed her
10-month-old son's diapers in a bucket of water.
   ``Now where do we go?'' she asked. ``It's not that we want them
to give us land, but something to live on and a way to pay for it.''
   Alejandro Chapa, mayor of San Pedro-Garza Garcia, the suburb of
Monterrey hit hardest by the disaster, said Monday that his first
priority is to find better lodgings for the 7,000 homeless people
in his community.
   ``It would be wonderful if we could get tents provisionally so
these people will have a place to live,'' Chapa said in an
interview at his home.
   Chapa said that perhaps the U.S. government or the state of
Texas would provide that kind of aid, although no formal request
has been made.
   ``They've always been very helpful,'' he said.
   The Santa Catarina once had a steady stream of water, but in the
decades since it dried up, the state government had begun to use
the riverbed to build major thoroughfares, high-tension electricity
towers, underground pipelines and plant hundreds of trees.
   But most impressive were the miles of tennis and basketball
courts, soccer and baseball fields and jogging tracks and even
dressing rooms used daily by thousands at the sports complex that
was destroyed.
   Chapa said the government would rebuild the roads and sports
complex. But he said those people with homes on the riverbed that
escaped ruin would be allowed to return there only provisionally.
   ``We're asking for a place to put them,'' Chapa said. ``Houses
can be built pretty fast, but not in a month.''

   An Arab League representative voiced concern
Monday about Israel's launch of a test satellite into orbit and
said it meant the Arabs would have to strengthen their defenses.
   Clovis Maksoud, who represents the Arab League in the United
States, said the satellite gave Israel ``a serious strategic
leverage'' since the country already had the capability to fire
long-range missiles.
   Maksoud, in an interview, stressed steps taken jointly by Israel
and the United States to strengthen their strategic ties.
   He cited Israel's inclusion in the U.S. program to develop a
space-based defense against ballistic missiles and ``Israel's
record which is replete with disclaiming nuclear capability.''
   As a result, Maksoud said, the launching of a test satellite
``warrants enhancing Arab defensive capabilities'' so that any
Mideast negotiations produce a peaceful outcome ``rather than
ratifying Israeli hegemony.''
   The satellite is designed for communications purposes, but the
Arab League official said it could be used to monitor Israel's foes.
   ``We are deeply concerned that such a communications satellite
can be modified into a spy system and, therefore, further enhance
the strategic imbalance which the American-Israeli strategic
agreement has introduced,'' Maksoud said.
   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman, meanwhile, said
the United States was not involved in any way with the Israeli
program.
   ``We don't have any details of the launch beyond what was
reported by the Israelis,'' he said.
   A spokesman for the U.S. Space Command in Colorado, Cmdr. Dugald
Gillies, said Monday that American radars and sensors picked up the
Israeli satellite shortly after launch. Its orbit has been
calculated to have a high point of 716 miles and a low point of 155
miles, he said.
   ``It is circling the earth every 98.836 minutes and the
satellite has an inclination (to earth) of 142.86 degrees,''
Gillies added. ``It was launched early Monday Eastern Daylight Time
and is in a near polar orbit.''
   Defense officials at the Pentagon said they were unsure exactly
what the satellite's payload included.
   ``But we're leaning toward more of an experimental
communications package as opposed to a true spy satellite,'' said
one source who asked not to be identified.
   ``This launch is impressive because it's a first, but I don't
think this particular satellite is going to offer much more ability
to keep tabs on their neighbors,'' the source said.
   Redman stressed that Israeli leaders had given public assurances
that their goal was ``peaceful purposes of space research and
technological advancement.''
   Israel is the eighth nation to place a satellite into space. The
country is one of the most advanced technologically in the world
and is generally believed to have nuclear capability.
   Israeli leaders, preferring to keep potential foes off guard,
have responded ambiguously to such assertions but also have given
assurances the country would not initiate a nuclear conflict.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Foreign Minister
Shimon Peres said the launch should not touch off an arms race with
Arab countries.

<HEAD>Conservatives Move To Block Release Of U.S. Payments To U.N.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Republican members of Congress have
introduced a resolution that would withhold part of the U.S. dues
payments to the United Nations that President Reagan ordered
released last week.
   The resolution, introduced by Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina
and Rep. Pat Swindall of Georgia, would block the release of $28.8
million of the $144 million that Congress appropriated to the
United Nations in fiscal 1988.
   Swindall said he introduced the resolution Friday because
Reagan's decision to release the dues payments ``cripples
congressional efforts to reform the U.N.'s anti-American programs.''
   Congress ordered the Reagan administration last year to withhold
part of the U.S. dues until Reagan certified that the United
Nations was making progress toward reducing its staff, adopting new
budget procedures and ending Soviet abuses of the U.N. civil
service system.
   Reagan made that certification last week in announcing that the
U.S. would release the $44 million withheld from its dues payment
in fiscal 1988 and would pay the full $144 million appropriated for
fiscal 1989.
   The 1987 law authorizing the U.N. dues payment specifies that
Congress can block payment of the final 20 percent of the dues if
it approves a joint resolution within 30 days of the president's
certification.

   Israel closed 22 adult education programs in
the West Bank Monday as part of a new offensive against Palestinian
activists in the occupied lands, prompting protests by hundreds of
Palestinians, witnesses said.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, meanwhile, an 18-year-old
Palestinian died of wounds he received in clashes with Israeli
troops last week, his relatives said.
   The death raised to 269 the number of Palestinians who have died
in the 9-month-old uprising in the occupied territories. Six
Israelis also have died.
   Soldiers shot and wounded four Arabs Monday, including a
15-year-old boy struck in the stomach, after Palestinian protesters
stoned soldiers in the West Bank towns of Nablus and Qalqiliya,
hospital officials said.
   The army confirmed three Palestinians were wounded in clashes in
Nablus and Qalqiliya and in the West Bank town of Jenin.
   Also Monday, the army said it confiscated the passports of six
Americans who allegedly took part in the anti-Israel protest.
   One of the Americans, 33-year-old Bill Doares of New York, told
The Associated Press that an army officer grabbed the passports
without explanation after the group watched from a distance as
troops fired rubber bullets to break up a peaceful protest by
Palestinian women.
   The latest casualties brought to 46 the number of Palestinians
wounded in the last three days. The Haaretz daily attributed the
rising numbers of Palestinian casualties to the widening use of
plastic bullets, and said soldiers are permitted to fire them even
if their lives are not in danger.
   Haaretz quoted military sources as saying this allowed troops to
be as tough as possible with demonstrators without risking large
numbers of Arab fatalities. Unlike live ammunition, plastic bullets
generally are not lethal except when fired from a distance of 20
yards or less.
   The army declined comment except to say soldiers must adhere to
strict, unspecified rules when using plastic bullets.
   In Nablus, the West Bank's largest city, troops closed 22 adult
education programs that taught courses in computer programming,
mathematics, chemistry and English, Palestinian witnesses said.
   The action was part of an ongoing Israeli effort to stifle the
growth of a grass-roots Palestinian leadership in the occupied
lands.
   ``We didn't have any choice but to close them down,'' said an
official of the West Bank military government, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``These programs are part of an all-out
effort by pro-PLO elements to replace the system run by Israel.''
   Israel has shut down more than 320 trade unions, professional
organizations and local committees in the West Bank and Gaza. In
addition, all schools in the West Bank and middle schools and high
schools in Gaza remain closed on army orders. Israel contends they
are breeding grounds for violent protests.
   Monday's closures prompted widespread protests in Nablus, where
hundreds of Palestinians marched in the city's open-air market
waving outlawed Palestinian flags and chanting anti-Israeli
slogans, Arab witnesses said.
   Dozens of school children flew kites bearing the red, green,
yellow and black colors of the Palestinian flag, the witnesses said.
   Also in Nablus, 200 masked supporters of the militant Islamic
group Hamas, or Zeal, held a separate march during which
protesters, who wore white T-shirts emblazoned with ``Hamas,''
carried Palestinian flags and Islamic banners.
   The American passports were confiscated Sunday in the West Bank
city of Ramallah, an army official said. He said the group
participated in an anti-Israeli protest and was detained. ``They
ran away, leaving the passports,'' said the official.
   But Doares denied the group joined the protest and said they
would refuse a police demand to submit to questioning before having
their passports returned.
   The group of community activists is touring the occupied lands
at the invitation of the San Francisco-based Palestine Solidarity
Committee.
   The U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem asked Israeli officials to look
into the matter, said consulate spokesman David Good. ``Our
position is that American passports are U.S. government property
and should not be taken,'' Good said.

<HEAD>Boy Makes Bogus Deposit, Then Writes Checks For Car, Clothes,
Hotel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 15-year-old boy made a bogus deposit of
nearly $30,000 at an automatic teller machine, then started writing
checks for a new car, clothes, and two nights hotel lodging with
his girlfriend, authorities said.
   Police and others involved in the investigation said the boy
went to a teller machine Saturday at a branch of Commercial Federal
savings and loan and punched in a combination of numbers to
register a deposit of $29,990 into his checking account.
   Then the boy, claiming to be 20, went to a car dealer and wrote
out a check for $18,399 for a 1988 Chevrolet IROC-model Camaro,
said Randy Kraft, general manager at Kraft Chevrolet.
   The dealership called a Commercial Federal employee, who said
the check couldn't be cleared until the deposit could be verified,
officials said.
   When the teen-ager was told the new car wouldn't be released
until the check cleared, he said he needed a car to attend a
wedding Saturday night.
   The dealer loaned the youth a demonstrator and he drove away,
picked up another 15-year-old boy and spent Saturday cruising.
   That night, the teen-ager picked up his 15-year-old girlfriend,
checked into a hotel at Missouri Valley, Iowa, and paid for two
nights' lodging.
   During the weekend, the youth wrote at least 10 checks for
clothing, food and other items, police said.
   The three planned to move to Arizona, apparently intending to
get jobs and support themselves, police said.
   Sunday evening, the three went to a check-cashing service and
the youth wrote a check for $25,000, showing his auto driver's
learner's permit as identification.
   A worker at the check-cashing company phoned a Commercial
Federal officer at home, who said she couldn't verify that the
check was good. Todd Wyrick Sr., manager of the check cashing
service, said he called police, who arrested the three.
   Police said the youth who wrote the checks was held in police
custody and the other two were released to their parents.
   Deputy Douglas County Attorney Linda Senff said Monday that she
had reviewed reports on the case and referred the three teen-agers
to juvenile authorities for possible charges.

   It took an extra three weeks, but ABC
received another Emmy Award for its series ``China Beach.''
   Presentation of the trophy, awarded to the ABC drama program for
best costuming, was delayed when it was learned that the Emmy
judging panel had not seen one of the programs nominated for
costuming in its entirety.
   The statuette was to be handed out on Aug. 27 during the
non-televised Emmy ceremony. Announcement of the Emmy win was made
Monday.
   Given to costumers Paul Kaatz and Darryl Levine, the award
brings ABC's total Emmy count to 22. ABC emerged from the televised
awards program on Aug. 28 with 21 trophies, most among the three
networks.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new, interfaith cable TV network went on the
air Monday, offering a variety of music, drama, documentaries and
magazine-style shows.
   Originating from quarters at lower Manhattan's Trinity Episcopal
Church and broadcast through uplink facilities on Long Island,
VISN's programming is being carried by several major cable
companies, its founders say.
   ``It's going to give a more rounded picture of what religious
life is all about,'' said the Rev. Wilford V. Bane Jr., interim
general manager of the new network.
   Other religious TV operations have been ``rather
single-dimensional,'' he said, and haven't reflected the mainstream
of religion in America.
   VISN, which stands for Vision Interfaith Satellite Network, is a
cooperative venture of 19 denominations, Protestant, Roman
Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Jewish and Mormon.
   It has signed contracts with 10 of the country's largest cable
system owners, operating several cable companies each. They
represent a potential viewing audience of 18{ million subscriber
homes, Bane said.
   ``We have started with big multi-system owners and have relied
on them to get their individual cable systems on line,'' he said.
   He estimated the programming in the initial weeks may be
available only to about 6 million households, since some local
systems will need time to adjust schedules to carry it.
   At the outset, the network is on the air in limited periods of
five hours on weekdays, 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. EDT and longer on
weekends, from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturdays and 6 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Sundays.
   It expects to go to 12-hour daily schedules by the first of the
year, including prime time.
   Bane, a United Methodist, said the content, in its varied forms,
would be oriented to religious-moral questions that people meet in
their everyday lives.
   Once the extent of subscribers is determined, the network
intends to seek commercial sponsors, as well as contributions from
foundations, to provide financing to expand production.
   However, unlike much religious programming, the network will not
solicit contributions.
   From the outset, fees the cable industry pays to carry the
network are expected to cover central operating costs of about $6
million annually.
   The 19 denominations are supplying an estimated 40 percent of
the programs and underwriting their production costs, a main
financial item. Some programs are being acquired, and others are to
be jointly produced by VISN.
   The first day's programming, mostly in half hour segments,
included:
   ``Westbrook Hospital,'' a drama produced by the Seven-day
Adventists; ``Man Alive,'' a documentary obtained from the Canadian
Broadcasting System, ``Catch the Spirit,'' a magazine-type show
produced by United Methodists.
   Also, ``Christopher Closeups,'' a Roman Catholic interview show
produced by the Christophers; a black gospel hour; ``The Worth of
Souls,'' a drama produced by the Mormons; a Maryknoll Fathers
documentary, and ``Reflections,'' a magazine-style show produced by
the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.
   Cable companies that have signed contracts with VISN are:
Tele-Communications Inc., American Television and Communications,
United Artists-Daniel, Post-Newsweek Cable, Centel Cable, TKR,
Paragon Cable, Jones Intercable, United Cable Television and
National Cable Television Cooperative.

   The government of Prime Minister Zbigniew
Messner resigned Monday after strong criticism of its management of
the economy. A lawmaker later asked Parliament to legalize the
banned Solidarity labor movement.
   Messner, prime minister since 1985, announced in a speech to
parliament that he and all 19 ministers were resigning. He defended
his government's performance but conceded ``mishaps'' in not
standing up to inflationary wage demands.
   It was the first time in Poland's postwar history that the
entire government stepped down. Messner said the mass resignation
would make it easier for parliament to make ``proper decisions''
about the future government.
   The Sejm, or parliament, approved the resignations near the end
of a 12-hour session Monday by a vote of 359-1, with 17
abstentions. A new government was expected to be named by the Sejm
this month.
   Messner or some of his ministers could be reappointed.
   The issue of Solidarity and the name of Lech Walesa, founder and
former head of the outlawed independent labor federation, came up
repeatedly in the free-wheeling discussion of the economy and
government that followed the resignations.
   Inflation caused a wave of labor strikes in April. A second wave
of strikes in August ended when authorities and Walesa agreed to
hold broad-based talks, now scheduled for next month, that may
include the issue of legalizing Solidarity.
   Solidarity ``should regain its proper place in the trade union
movement,'' Ryszard Bender, an independent parliament member from
Lublin, told parliament Monday. ``Apart from associations, apart
from Solidarity, ... there is also a need to have new political
parties.''
   It was the first call in parliament for legalizing the union
movement since Solidarity was suppressed in December 1981 with the
imposition of martial law.
   Turning to address Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski,
Bender urged that Jaruzelski and Walesa, ``the first Nobel Peace
laureate in Polish history,'' meet and make a joint statement
concerning Poland's ``most vital interests.''
   Jaruzelski smiled slightly but showed no other reaction to the
remarks.
   Later Sejm deputy Aleksander Legatowicz, an economist, said the
government failed because ``it closed itself off from criticism.''
   ``There are people allergic to the word `socialism' and others
allergic to the word `Solidarity,' '' he said.
   Solidarity, the first free trade union movement in the Soviet
bloc, emerged from a tumultuous summer of labor unrest in 1980.
   About 30 deputies spoke Monday, with several endorsing the
planned round-table talks with the opposition. Bender was the only
speaker openly calling for reinstatement of Solidarity.
   Deputy Sylwester Zawadzki said ``extreme demands'' such as
calling for trade union pluralism ``may not make reconciliation
easier.''
   Under Poland's system, the Communist Party led by the Politburo
is the actual seat of power and appoints the government through its
majority in parliament. As first secretary of the Politburo,
Jaruzelski is the country's leader. The government is responsible
for executing the party's goals.
   The party leadership has maintained that its goals for reforming
the economy and political system have been correct but
implementation by Messner's government has been faulty. The Soviet
press also has recently criticized the Polish government.
   One speaker suggested last Friday that the government was being
used as a whipping boy.
   ``The situation resembles a soccer game,'' said Tomasz Adamczuk,
a member of the Communist-allied Peasant Party. ``The players are
the political parties, the Polish trade union alliance, the
opposition and others. The ball is the government.''
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman
welcomed the understanding reached Friday between government
negotiators and Walesa on future talks.
   Redman said Monday that ``a process of national reconciliation
may have begun, and all sides should strive to realize its historic
potential.''
   In his speech, Messner appeared to question the recent emphasis
on dialogue with the opposition. ``We are paying for (the strikes)
now with escalation of demands and greater chaos in the market,
loss of authority of management. We again have become a symbol of
anarchy in the world,'' he said. ``Political methods of solving
tensions cannot mean tolerance for law-breaking.''
   Immediately prior to Messner's speech, parliament heard a
critical report from a committee set up to monitor the government's
performance in implementing economic reform. Its chairwoman,
Krystyna Jandy Jendroska, cited the dismal performance of the
economy in the areas of inflation, production, housing,
agriculture, taxes and investments.
   She urged that more ``coalition forces'' from outside the party
be brought into government, including experts in the economy.
   The criticism of the government echoed statements at a Communist
Party plenum Aug. 27-28, during the wave of strikes.
   The government was criticized as sluggish and ineffectual in
implementing a broad economic reform plan this year and for its
handling of price increases that have led to annual inflation of 60
percent.

<TEXT>
   The wife of conservative Rep. Robert
K. Dornan apologized to a gay community leader she called a ``fag''
at a meeting and later revealed her brother is a homosexual who is
dying of AIDS.
   Dornan, R-Calif., afterward told reporters he knew his
brother-in-law was a homosexual, but did not know that he has
acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   ``Why didn't you tell me?'' he asked his wife, Sallie, after she
told reporters that one of her four brothers is a homosexual and is
dying of AIDS.
   ``I didn't want to hurt you,'' she said.
   The Dornans declined to be interviewed further on the issue
Monday.
   ``They regard this as a personal matter that they don't want to
continue publicly talking about it ... not out of any shame for
themselves or the family, but for the privacy for the brother,''
said Dornan's chief aide, Brian Bennett.
   Bennett refused to name the brother. He said Dornan's family and
Mrs. Dornan's family had not always gotten along, in attempting to
explain why Dornan did not know about his brother-in-law's illness.
   Dornan is seeking a third two-year term.
   The relevation occurred at a so-called town meeting Sunday held
by Dornan at Pacifica High School to meet with constituents. The
school is in Dornan's district, about 30 miles southeast of
downtown Los Angeles.
   During a heated exchange between her husband and Jeff
LeTourneau, a gay activist, Mrs. Dornan screamed, ``Shut up, fag.''
   Then LeTourneau and about 30 other chanting protesters were
escorted from the auditorium by police at Dornan's request.
LeTourneau was allowed to return and pose the last question, and he
demanded an apology from Mrs. Dornan.
   ``I'm very sorry I did that,'' said Mrs. Dornan, her voice
breaking. ``You were all yelling at my husband, whom I love.
   ``I apologize, but it will not rid the anger in my heart. My
brother is dying and he grows thinner every day and has sores on
his body. ... I want you to understand there's great anger and pain
inside of me.''.
   She said later that gay activists like LeTourneau were trying to
make the AIDS crisis into a civil-rights issue instead of a medical
issue.
   ``A plague doesn't have any civil rights,'' Mrs. Dornan said.
   LeTourneau, an organizer of the Orange County Visibility League,
a gay rights group, accepted Mrs. Dornan's apology and asked Dornan
if he would support federal subsidies to AIDS sufferers to purchase
the drug AZT, or azidothymidine, which was recently approved for
AIDS treatment by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
   ``Of course,'' said Dornan. ``It extends the precious thing we
call human life.''
   AZT is not a cure but has been found to prolong the lives of
some victims by strengthening their immune systems. AIDS attacks
the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections
and cancers.
   Before Dornan's town meeting, LeTourneau had organized a rally
of the gay rights group to protest what they say is Dornan's
anti-homosexual stand.
   In his defense, Dornan, said he contributed part of his $12,400
congressional pay raise to help AIDS hospices and called a news
conference in January 1987 to publicize the enormity of the issue.
   ``I've lost friends and people I know to AIDS,'' Dornan said.
``Terry Dolan was a good friend.''
   Dolan, head of the National Conservative Political Action
Committee, died of complications of AIDS. Dornan said he also was
acquainted with conservative lawyer Roy Cohn and entertainer
Liberace, who attended his church at one time, who also died of
complications from AIDS.

<TEXT>
   Tornadoes spawned by Hurricane Gilbert
caused more than $35 million damage in this inland southern Texas
city apparently harder hit than coastal cities that faced the main
storm, officials said Monday.
   ``It's amazing to me that no one was killed. This is far worse
than anything in Brownsville,'' Gov. Bill Clements said here after
touring ravaged areas of both cities. ``There is no place anywhere
that suffered this kind of damage.''
   Two people were killed in the 41 tornadoes that leap-frogged
across the state. Heavy rain swelled rivers in some areas, but no
injuries were reported.
   Clements said he would wait for county officials to send him
damage estimates before taking steps for a disaster declaration and
sending requests for aid to the federal government.
   A federal disaster designation would let businesses receive
low-interest loans to rebuild and some residents would be placed in
temporary housing for a certain period, said Ed Hargett, regional
director for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   Earlier, Clements viewing damage in Brownsville on the southern
tip of Texas, which felt part of the hurricane's wind and waves.
   ``I think that all of us feel a sense of relief that we are
blessed that there is no more damage in Texas and more particularly
here in Cameron County than you have experienced,'' Clements said
after flying over waterfront areas at Brownsville.
   What little was left of the hurricane was moving across the
Midwest toward Illinois, leaving heavy rain in its wake.
   ``I don't think we are expecting much more in the way of trouble
from Hurricane Gilbert,'' said Laureen Chernow, spokeswoman for the
state's Emergency Management Council in Austin.
   San Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros toured tornado-ravaged areas
Sunday, and said he wanted to extend his state of emergency
declaration through Friday.
   The declaration will enable the city to try to seek assistance
from the Small Business Administration and other federal agencies.
   ``I don't want to deny anyone potential help,'' Cisneros said.
   Twisters that raged through a residential area in the border
town of Del Rio caused an estimated $1 million damage, but no
injuries late Saturday, officials said.
   In Corpus Christi, two sea beaches in county parks were closed
because they had about $100,000 damage, Nueces County Commissioner
J.P. Luby said.
   ``The foredunes were extensively damaged,'' he said. ``The tide
went in and melted them away like butter.'' Foredunes along the
beach protect larger interior dunes from erosion.
   Luby, who said he would seek federal assistance in the park
cleanup effort, said county jail inmates will help clean up timber
and other debris and repair damage to the foredunes and parking
lots.
   But San Antonio, which opened up shelters for Gulf Coast
residents fleeing the pending storm, seemed to have suffered the
worst damage.
   One man was killed Friday when a utility pole struck his house
and a woman was thrown from her mobile home by a tornado.
   The storm system then spawned a tornado that cut a path through
Kelly Air Force Base, causing $3 million damage to 12 buildings and
an additional $25 million to aircraft parts.
   Another tornado destroyed the air-conditioning system at the
Veterans Administration Hospital, causing $2 million damage and
prompting Cisneros to issue the emergency decree so equipment could
be flown in and to avoid moving some 700 patients.
   Another tornado struck The Lodge apartments, destroying about
120 units, damaging 264 others and leaving 300 homeless. Other
twisters hit residential and businesses areas, causing about $5
million damage, officials said.
   Heavy rain caused the Rio Grande to rise about 30 feet from Lake
Amistad outside Del Rio to alcon Lake in Zapata.
   ``It didn't pose any problems because boaters were warned to get
off the river,'' Ms. Chernow said.

<HEAD>With AM-Political Rdp Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Aides to Democrat Michael Dukakis proposed
Monday that the news anchormen of four commercial television
networks serve as the questioners in upcoming presidential debates,
but sources said the idea was rejected by George Bush's advisers.
   Aides to the Republican presidential hopeful responded with a
list of proposed moderators and questioners from both print and
electronic media. As of late Monday, the Dukakis campaign had not
agreed to the idea, sources said.
   Only six days before the first debate, the campaigns are still
sparring over the arrangments for the televised confrontations
between Bush and Dukakis.
   The first debate, sponsored by the parties' commission on
debates, is scheduled Sunday at Wake Forest University. The second
presidential debate is due Oct. 13 or Oct. 15 in Los Angeles _
sponsored by the League of Women Voters.
   The late round in the pre-debate sniping came as Dukakis
campaign chairman Paul Brontas called James Baker, his counterpart
in the Bush camp, on Monday.
   Sources famiiliar with the talks who spoke only on the condition
they not be identified said Brountas suggested that the anchors
from CBS News, ABC News, NBC News and the Cable News Network be the
moderators and questioners during both presidential debates and the
vice president debate scheduled Oct. 5 in Omaha.
   That would mean CBS's Dan Rather, NBC's Tom Brokaw, ABC's Peter
Jennings and probably CNN's Bernard Shaw would be on stage for all
three events.
   ``This is a television event,'' said one Dukakis aide of the
idea. ``We want to do what we can to make it an event that people
will pay attention to. We think that they anchors would make it a
bigger event...More people would watch it.''
   But a top Bush adviser said the idea was turned down ``as
blatantly unfair to the print media and other television
correspondents.''
   This source said Bush responded later Monday with a list of four
proposed moderators and 10 panelists. The source would not name any
of them, saying only the list was made up of network anchors,
network correspondents and print representatives.
   The Bush source took the occasion to accuse the Dukakis campaign
of violating the agreement not to talk about such matters.
   ``We are operating under a written agreement of understanding
not to discuss the negotiations surrouding'' debate details, said
the aide. ``Obviously that has been violated,'' and thus the source
gave the Bush campaign position on the matters.
   The pre-debate sparring is typical of presidential debate
negotiations. What is different in 1988 is that the campaigns are
negotiating directly, rather than with an involved third party like
the League of Women Voters.
   With the effort by the two political parties to take the
sponsorship of the debates away from the league _ which has done it
for the past three presidential campaigns _ the two campaigns have
squabbled more directly on these matters than in the past.

<HEAD>Whoopi Goldberg Cast As Alien Lounge Hostess In New `Star Trek'
Series</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Comedian-actress Whoopi Goldberg has been
cast as an ``alien humanoid hostess'' of an on-board lounge aboard
the Starship Enterprise for the ``Star Trek: The Next Generation''
television series.
   Miss Goldberg's character, Guinan, will be a recurring role,
according to a release. That means she won't be on every episode of
the Paramount Television syndicated show, which enters its second
season.
   ``I've always been a Trekkie, so I thought it was time for me to
boldly go where no man has gone before,'' said Miss Goldberg, 32,
referring to the original ``Star Trek'' show's opening line
describing the mission of the Starship Enterprise.
   Goldberg has starred in several movies and won a Golden Globe
and an Academy Award nomination in 1985 for her role in ``The Color
Purple.''
   The ``Ten-Forward'' lounge where Miss Goldberg's character will
preside is new to the series, and will give its writers a chance to
show characters relaxing off-duty.
   ``We had been looking for someone to play an unusual role in a
very different kind of Starship set,'' said series executive
producer and creator Gene Roddenberry. ``It wasn't until we learned
of Whoopi's interested in our show that the idea finally began to
gel. We look forward to the new dimension she will bring to our
series.''
   Miss Goldberg has starred in ``Jumpin' Jack Flash,''
``Burglar,'' ``Fatal Beauty,'' and ``Clara's Heart,'' which will be
released in October.
   The comedian, noted for her dreadlock hair style and oversized
clothing, has also starred in several cable television specials,
including the two ``Comic Relief'' shows to aid the homeless.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Dan Quayle ridiculed Michael Dukakis'
defense posture on Monday and accused the Democrat of causing ``an
economic manacle'' rather than a miracle in his home state of
Massachusetts.
   At rallies in Knoxville, Tenn., and on the start here of a
four-day western swing, the Republican vice presidential candidate
hammered at Dukakis' record on both pocketbook and national
security issues.
   ``The West has a lot of big, open spaces _ just like the Dukakis
defense record,'' Quayle told the crowd of about 250 in Casper. He
laughed at the pose Dukakis struck last week in Michigan when he
donned a helmet and rode in a tank.
   ``In just one week, his defense policy went from general
confustion to Gen. Patton,'' the Indiana senator said.
   Earlier, he faced down persistent hecklers at a noontime rally
at an outdoor shopping mall in downtown Knoxville, in Republican
East Tennessee. Quayle said his aim was to ``burst the bubble'' of
Dukakis' reputation as a competent administrator.
   In Casper, he excoriated ``the man from Massachusetts'' on gun
control, his opposition to the death penalty, and on a
Massachusetts prison furlough program that Quayle said ``let on
average one first-degree murderer out on furlough each day'' since
1983. The furlough program has since modified to exclude murderers.
   Later, Quayle was headed to Boise, Idaho, the 30th state he has
campaigned in.
   In Knoxville, he charged Dukakis with driving citizens away from
Massachusetts with high taxing and spending _ higher spending per
capital than any other state.
   ``Michael Dukakis did not create an economic miracle in
Massachusetts. He created an economic manacle ... that inhibits
private sector expansion at the expense of public sector
expansion,'' Quayle said.
   The Indiana senator told the rally, ``The last thing in the
world he should want this campaign to be about is competence. ...
The record of Michael Dukakis as governor of Massachusetts is not
something of which to be proud.''
   Quayle said Massachusetts ranks 40th out of 50 states in total
employment growth and 45th in manufacturing job growth. The state
actually lost 90,000 manufacturing jobs between June 1984 and
January 1988, he said.
   Several dozen pro-Dukakis demonstrators positioned themselves
near the front of the crowd of 750, waving signs and making
catcalls.
   ``Don't worry about the yellers. You know if you had to support
Dukakis, you'd be yelling too,'' Quayle said in his sole digression
from the speech.
   The Indiana senator charged Dukakis had earned the title ``Mr.
Tax Hike'' and ``Mr. Job Loss,'' not ``Mr. President.''
   Quayle conceded that Massachusetts has a low unemployment rate,
but said that is because ``people are leaving Massachusetts.''
   Quayle said Dukakis ``raised virtually every tax in
Massachusetts _ sales taxes, personal income taxes, business taxes,
taxes on cigarettes, gas, beer and wine.'' The state legislature,
not the governor, deserves credit for taxes that were cut during
Dukakis' three terms, Quayle said.
   Quayle claimed, ``He has presided over horrendous growth in the
debt of Massachusetts and ... has created more debt than all
previous governors of Massachusetts combined.''
   Massachusetts, like most states, is required by its constitution
to operate on a balanced budget. Quayle aides said he was referring
not to its operating budget, but bonded indebtedness.
   David Prosperi, Quayle's press secretary, said, ``He's not the
only one who's doing it, but we're pointing out the fact that he's
issuing debt to come up with a balanced budget _ debt though
bonds.''
   Quayle ate a fast lunch at a Greek restaurant, Peroulas', before
departing Knoxville.
   Quayle flies from Boise to Las Vegas Tuesday, then moves on to
Phoenix and California before heading home.
   The Republican ticket is rated solidly ahead of the Democrats in
the Mountain states and Nevada, while a tight race is forecast in
California for its 47 electoral votes.

   Three anti-apartheid activists taking refuge
in a U.S. consulate in South Africa still have not decided whether
to accept the South African government's offer to leave without
fear of rearrest, a State Department spokesman said Monday.
   The American Embassy in Pretoria, South Africa, said after the
three fled from detention in a hospital to the consulate in
Johannesburg a week ago that the United States would not force them
to leave against their will. It is against U.S. policy, however, to
grant them asylum at a diplomatic mission, the embassy said.
   Thus ``the three men remain in temporary refuge,'' State
Department spokesman Charles Redman told reporters.
   In South Africa, he said, ``We have explained what our policy
is, and what we are doing, and where we stand.''
   The three activists are Murphy Morobe and Mohammed Vallio Moosa,
of the United Democratic Front, and Vusi Khanyile, chairman of the
National Education Crisis committee.
   U.S. civil rights activist Jesse Jackson met for an hour last
Wednesday with South African Ambassador Pieter Koornhof for a talk
that both described as positive.
   Asked whether the U.S. government regards Jackson as an
intermediary in the affair, Redman said, ``There is no U.S.
intermediary role in the sense that you are referring to, and I am
not sure what contact that Mr. Jackson has had with the people in
the consulate.''
   Jackson planned to make some telephone calls to South Africa,
but his office in Chicago said they had not yet been made.

   Republican George Bush, warming up for his
debate with Michael Dukakis this weekend, accused his Democratic
rival Monday of being ``anti-business'' and pursuing a
divide-and-conquer campaign strategy aimed at polarizing Americans.
   ``He's begun a calculated strategy of emphasizing differences
between rich and poor, between one region of the country and
another,'' the vice president told the Lower Bucks County Chamber
of Commerce.
   The luncheon speech, in which Bush offered himself as the
champion of small business, was his only public event Monday. He
returned to Washington afterward to prepare for his first
nationally televised debate with Dukakis in Winston-Salem, N.C.,
Sunday night.
   Campaign spokeswoman Sheila Tate said the GOP nominee planned to
spend most of the week getting briefings from policy aides and
taking part in ``mock debates,'' with economic adviser Richard G.
Darman standing in for Dukakis.
   Campaign sources said Bush soon will propose a ``parental
leave'' program that would use tax incentives to encourage business
companies to give parents time off to care for children.
   Until now, Bush has made only vague mention of such a plan,
saying that women should not have to worry about getting their jobs
back after a pregnancy or finding time to care for a sick child.
   The Reagan administration has opposed parental job leaves.
   The vice president used three charts and a flurry of statistics
in his speech here to demonstrate what he claimed was Dukakis' poor
treatment of businesses as governor of Massachusetts.
   ``Frankly, since he's never been in business, I don't think he
understands the full effect of his own anti-business scheme,'' Bush
said.
   The vice president asserted that in the first six months of this
year, the number of business bankruptcies had fallen nationally but
risen in Massachusetts. Moreover, Bush, said, ``he clearly wants to
raise taxes.''
   In Boston, the Dukakis campaign called together eight
Massachusetts business leaders who support the candidate. ``I can't
believe how anyone can say that the Massachusetts economy is not
conducive to business,'' said one of them, Bernard J. O'Keefe,
chairman of an electronics manufacturing firm and recent chairman
of the National Association of Manufacturers.
   ``I've been to every state in the union and I can assure you
that there is not a state in the union that comes anywhere near
close to Massachusetts as an environment for growth and
employment,'' he said.
   And Dukakis campaign manager Susan Estrich said Bush ``went to
lunch today and served up another plate of whoppers'' about the
governor's economic record.
   ``George doesn't know what he's talking about when he calls Mike
Dukakis anti-business,'' she said, citing four private, independent
rankings that applauded a favorable business climate in
Massachusetts.
   On bankruptcies, she said the rate of business failures in
Massachusetts was less than half the the national rate during the
eight years of the Reagan administration, and had fallen by 28
percent since Dukakis became governor in 1983.
   She also said Bush was ``flat wrong'' in charging that Dukakis
had effectively doubled taxes on certain small businesses in
Massachusetts.
   The state gave companies with fewer than 35 shareholders a $15
million tax break in 1985, but when the federal tax overhaul law
took effect, the state's revenue loss nearly tripled.
   As a result, Dukakis and the legislature amended state law to
restrict the tax break to corporations that grossed $6 million or
less annually, thus disqualifying 750 larger companies that had to
pay a higher corporate rate.
   
   
   
   
   Bush said the current economic expansion is ``tough news for my
opponent to swallow,'' so as the campaign heats up, ``he's pursued
a strategy of dividing Americans.''
   Said Bush: ``I understand the motivation. He won't win unless he
convinces the electorate that everything is bad in America.''
   ``I am dismayed by the divide-and-conquer strategy,'' Bush said.
   The vice president expressed support for federal limits on
certain lines of liability lawsuits in an effort to trim business
insurance costs.
   ``In our litigation-happy society, high insurance rates and
outrageous awards threaten to put some companies out of business,''
Bush said.
   He promised to work with Congress to produce legislation aimed
at lowering the cost of product liability insurance.
   The vice president was forced to postpone plans for a meeting
with Roman Catholic Church leaders in Philadelphia on Monday
because fog prevented his plane from landing there.
   A Bush supporter, Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., told reporters he
doesn't agree with Bush when he speaks critically of the American
Civil Liberties Union.
   Bush frequently accuses Dukakis of being ``a card-carrying
member of the ACLU.''
   ``There is nothing wrong with belonging to the ACLU,'' said
Specter, a former prosecutor.

Gains</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Average SAT scores lost ground in 1988 for the
first time in eight years, but minority students continued a
decade-long pattern of impressive gains, the College Board reported
Monday.
   Scores on the verbal section of the Scholastic Aptitude Test
fell two points to an average 428, while the average on the math
section was unchanged at 476, according to the board's annual
report.
   Both portions of the multiple-choice exam taken each year by 1.1
million college-bound students are scored on a scale of 200-800,
with a combined 1600 being perfect.
   The combined math-verbal average of 904 marked the first decline
in eight years. The national average hit a low of 890 in 1980,
recovered a bit to 906 by 1985 and was unchanged until this year's
slight decline.
   Ironically, the release of the SAT averages coincided with the
planned departure Tuesday of U.S. Education Secretary William J.
Bennett, who during his 3{ years in office had credited the Reagan
administration with spurring reforms which until this year had
helped produce gradually improving SAT scores.
   In a statement Monday, Bennett blamed the school establishment
for the falloff in scores: ``No medals for America in this news. I
said in April that `the absolute level at which our improvements
are taking place is unacceptably low.' Today it's a bit lower, and
still not acceptable. C'mon, team! Back into training.''
   College Board officials nonetheless cheered the ``stability'' of
test scores in recent years.
   ``We're pleased, frankly, that there is as much stability in the
scores as the data suggests,'' board President Donald M. Stewart
told reporters. He noted that scores were generally holding up even
though the number of test-takers has risen 13 percent since 1986
and the number of minority test-takers was up 23,066 in the last
year alone.
   Minority students in the class of '88, especially blacks, posted
the strongest gains. Verbal scores among blacks last year rose an
average of two points to 353, and math scores rose seven points to
384 _ doubly impressive since the number of black test-takers rose
39 percent in three years from 70,156 in 1985 to 97,483 last year,
said the board's research director, Robert G. Cameron.
   Stewart said it was unclear why minority students were gaining.
One explanation is that federal programs such as Head Start begun
in the 1960s and 1970s and aimed at assisting poor students are now
paying off in higher minority SAT scores.
   Since 1976, the first year the College Board compiled ethnic
data, combined scores by blacks have climbed 51 points. But they
still trail average white test-takers by 198 points. Whites
averaged 445 on the verbal in 1987-88, down two points, and 490 on
the math, up a point.
   Among Mexican-Americans, verbal scores were up three points over
last year to 382, and math scores up four to 428. Their combined
gains since 1976 amount to 29 points.
   Men continued to outperform women, with male test-takers scoring
an average 498 math and 435 verbal, while females scored 455 math,
422 verbal. Test critics have charged that the SAT is biased
against women both in its wording and content. College Board
officials deny the bias charge and counter that schools may be to
blame for steering females into less demanding curricula.
   Meanwhile, national averages on the ACT, the predominant college
entrance exam in 28 states, mostly in the West and Midwest, were
also little changed. The approximately 1 million students who took
the ACT last school year averaged 18.8 on a scale of 1-36, up
slightly from the 18.7 average the year before, according to the
American College Testing Program, the organization based in Iowa
City, Iowa, which administers the test.
   Scores among whites were unchanged at 19.6. Blacks rose 0.2 to
13.6, American Indians and Alaskan Natives gained 0.3 to 14.9,
Mexican-Americans were up 0.3 to 15.7, and Hispanics were up 0.2 to
17.1.

<HEAD>U.N. Chief To Make First Visit in Five Years To South Africa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The U.N. Secretary-General will make his first
visit to South Africa in five years on Wednesday for peace talks
with white minority leaders of the nation isolated and condemned by
the world body as racist.
   He then holds peace talks in Angola.
   U.N. officials said Monday that Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar will confer with President P.W. Botha in Pretoria, the
South African capital, from Wednesday to Friday on implementing a
U.N. plan for the independence of Namibia, or South-West Africa.
   The officials declined to discuss his schedule in South Africa
or say whether he will meet with black leaders.
   But South Africa's new U.N. ambassador, Jeremy B. Shearar, told
The Associated Press he doubted the secretary-general would meet
opposition leaders.
   ``I think we could assume he is not going to complicate this
short visit,'' Shearar said in a telephone interview.
   ``We are dealing with a topic which has occupied us and the U.N.
for some 40 years and it would not be sensitive for anybody to try
to deal with other issues ... It (meeting opposition leaders) could
cloud the issues,'' he said.
   Perez de Cuellar ``trusts that his visit will help expedite the
implementation'' of a U.N. independence plan for Namibia, Security
Council Resolution 435 of 1978, a U.N. announcement of the visit
said.
   South Africa has been governing Namibia under a mandate issued
by the now-defunct League of Nations after World War I and rejected
the U.N. resolutions.
   South Africa has said it is willing to grant independence to
Namibia by next June 1 if the estimated 50,000 Cuban troops
supporting the Marxist government in neighboring Angola have left
by that date.
   A U.N. observer team is expected to oversee the transition to
independence, beginning in November.
   Shearar said the visit ``is coming at a very important
juncture'' since the United Nations shortly will be involved in the
peace process. ``It is very important that the process should have
an impulse from the secretary-general himself,'' he said.
   A feeling exists in South Africa, Shearar said, ``that the U.N.
cannot be impartial on these (southern African) issues and we think
it is hopeful that he should be there and demonstrate his
impartiality and that of the Secretariat.
   ``We think both ourselves and the United Nations have a great
deal to gain from the visit.''
   Shearar said he hoped no one would raise ``extraneous issues''
on the independence of Namibia and the withdrawal of Cuban troops
from Angola. ``We are looking forward to reaching an understanding
and a commitment on the part of the Angolans and the Cubans for
their withdrawal. And their presence too close to the border oculd
inhibit free and fair elections,'' he said.
   Shearar said he hoped the peace process in southern Africa
eventually would lead to a restoration of South Africa's voting
rights and participation in the General Assembly. The Pretoria
government was stripped of its voting rights in 1974.
   ``We hope that during the negotiations that go on, people will
see what is happening in South Africa and see a general commitment
to reform,'' Shearar said.
   ``Maybe it's not such a bad idea to have South Africa's voice
back in the corridors of the General Assembly ... They may find it
is sensible to deal with us rather than isolate us because that
will not sort our our internal problems.''
   ``I would greatly look forward to being permanent representative
when we resume our seat in the General Assembly, but there is a lot
of ground to cover before that happens,'' the envoy he said.
   In Angola, Perez de Cuellar will confer with President Eduardo
dos Santos on the situation in the area, U.N. officials said.
   South Africa regularly is denounced by the United Nations and
the Security Council for apartheid, its rule over Namibia, and
reported undermining of neighboring states.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Impose Transport Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bus service came to a virtual
standstill Monday after leftist rebels called for a nationwide
transportation ban and threatened drivers who took to the roads.
   Despite assurances from the military that transportation would
be protected, a vast majority of bus and truck drivers chose to
park their vehicles.
   Only a handful of buses, the main means of mass transit,
circulated in this capital city of 1 million inhabitants. More than
70 percent of the urban bus traffic was halted and inter-city
service was even more severely curtailed, an official of the bus
owners' association told The Associated Press.
   A dispatcher at one of the capital's two terminals said 90
percent of the bus service between provinces was stopped.
   Local radio stations with correspondents in all 14 provinces
also said the ban was about 90-percent effective.
   Workers had to walk to their jobs or pay inflated fares to
pickup truck and van owners, who turn significant profits during
such bans. Dozens of overcrowded small trucks and vans circulated
through downtown.
   There were fewer private cars on the roads, but public
transportation was more severely curtailed.
   The ban on bus and truck traffic was the fifth called this year
by the Marxist-led guerrilla army, which has been waging a nearly
9-year-old war against the U.S.-backed government.
   The government had repeatedly urged on broadcast media that
Monday's ban be ignored, saying the military would protect vehicles.
   The ban is indefinite. Previous bans this year, during which
about 35 vehicles were burned, lasted three days each.
   Col. Mauricio Vargas, the army chief of operations, told YSU
radio that about 13,000 soldiers were providing and protecting
transport.
   ``We refuse to allow a violent minority to impose its will on
us,'' he said.
   Soldiers rode shotgun aboard several state-owned buses
circulating in the capital and some army trucks carried passengers
to and from the city outskirts. Lorgio DeLeon, a 48-year-old father
of six, was stranded at the eastern bus terminal with no way to get
to his tailor's job in Zacatecoluca, 35 miles southeast of San
Salvador.
   ``This hurts the poor worker more than anyone. We don't work
today, we get our pay docked,'' he said. ``The person who has some
capital, he just stays home, where he has everything.''
   Rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front said the
ban was in response to what it termed official repression. The
guerrillas, in announcing the ban, referred to the actions of riot
troops who broke up a Sept. 13 demonstration by leftist university
students.
   The troops used tear gas and clubs and fired shots in the air to
disperse nearly 3,000 students at that protest. About 250
demonstrators were arrested.
   All but 14 were subsequently released, with the remainder
charged with what the government called ``terrorist acts.''

   A 42-year-old Czechoslovak used a hang
glider Monday to flee the country by soaring over the Austrian
border, police said.
   The craft, which had a small motor, flew 31 miles from the
Slovakian city of Breclav to the eastern Austria city of Sierndorf,
about three miles inside the border, Austrian authorities said.
   Police identified the man only as Jiri R. He could have made it
to Austria by flying only six miles, but he told reporters that he
lost his bearings in an early morning fog.
   He was transferred to the Traiskirchen refugee camp south of
Vienna, authorities said.

   The Trail of Tears Commemorative Wagon
Train crossed the Tennessee River on Monday, the third day of its
1,000-mile journey to Oklahoma.
   Eight covered wagons were taken across the quarter-mile expanse
of water on a tug-operated ferry connecting state Route 60 midway
between Georgetown and Madison.
   The crossing went without a hitch, although one wagon had to be
pushed onto the barge when the mule team pulling it was unable to
get any footing on the slick metal approach ramp.
   ``This was our second big hurdle and it went off just fine,''
said Ray Morris of Golconda, Ill., the project coordinator. ``Our
first hurdle was just getting the wagon train on the road Saturday;
that was a miracle considering the short time we had putting this
project together.''
   The wagon train departed Saturday morning from Red Clay State
Historical Park, 15 miles east of Cleveland. After three days of
traveling, the eight covered wagons had covered slightly more than
50 miles.
   Although the project is designed to commemorate the 150th
anniversary of the removal of the Cherokee Indians from the
Southeast in 1838, as of Monday no Cherokees had traveled with the
wagon train.
   ``We did invite the Cherokees in Oklahoma to join us but they're
a poor people and couldn't afford to pay their own expenses for a
76-day trip,'' said Morris, an agricultural adviser for the
University of Illinois.
   Morris said the university was continuing to pay his salary
while he made the trip because the journey is seen as a cultural
contribution to the community. However, he said there were no funds
available to finance Indian participation.
   ``The state of Illinois gave us $1,000 and some of the
communities along the way have promised to provide free services
such as meals and feed for our animals,'' he said. ``Otherwise
we're paying our own way.''
   Meanwhile, Harley Grant of Chattanooga, the interim chairman for
Tennessee's Commission on Indian Affairs, said he was surprised
that the Cherokees had not played a greater role in the project.
   Grant added that the Cherokees had been indirectly invited to
participate in the project several months ago.
   ``But most of us work for a living and were unable to make the
journey from day to day,'' he said.
   Morris said he expected some Cherokees to join the wagon train
as it moved further westward. He also noted that the journey will
end at Tahlequah, Okla., the capital of the Cherokee Nation.
   ``There will be a big observation at the Cherokee Reservation
when we get there, in early December,'' he said. ``And, too, we did
receive a letter of recognition from Wilma Mankiller, the principal
chief of the Cherokees.
   In her letter, Mankiller thanked the participants for
commemorating the Cherokees' terrible ordeal. Grant also said he
thought the wagon train project was a good idea.

   A 17-month-old boy wandered around an

mother and then himself in the residence in this Washington suburb,
police said Monday.
   The bodies of the unidentified couple, who apparently were
estranged, were found about 1:45 p.m. by a neighbor at the Bent
Tree Circle residence, said Fairfax County police spokesman Peter
Fakoury.
   It was not immediately known how long the couple had been dead,
but police estimated the shooting occurred during the weekend. They
were believed to be in their 20s.
   The boy was unharmed but was taken to Fair Oaks Hospital,
Fakoury said. The child has been placed in the custody of the
county department of social services.
   The names were withheld pending positive identification and

   Michael Dukakis said Monday that many
Americans are ``treading water'' after eight years of Reaganomics
and still awaiting the economic recovery trumpeted by the
Republicans.
   ``After eight years in power, the Republican party seems to have
exhausted its reservoir of ideas,'' Dukakis said in a speech that
echoed refrains from John and Robert Kennedy's campaigns.
   ``In their hearts they know that four more years of Reaganomics
would be bad for the country and that four more years of
Reaganomics without Reagan would be a disaster.''
   ``We can do better than that,'' Dukakis said as he set out on a
two-day Southern swing.
   He said Republican prosperity means young families having to
postpone having children, kids going home to an empty house at the
end of the day because their mothers must work and can't afford
child care, and 40 million Americans without health insurance.
   ``Mr. Bush doesn't seem to understand that. I do,'' he said as
he set out on an abbreviated week of campaigning to allow him ample
time to prepare for next Sunday's campaign debate.
   ``We don't need a warmed over call to selfishness; we need a new
call to greatness,'' said the Massachusetts governor, who is
struggling to reverse Bush's recent gains in the polls.
   From Arkansas, Dukakis flew to Texas for a joint appearance with
vice presidential running mate Lloyd Bentsen.
   In a speech about energy policy, Dukakis said he would convene a
bipartisan energy summit with congressional leaders shortly after
taking office. The summit would be chaired by Bentsen, a Texas
senator.
   Dukakis accused Bush of tailoring his position to the region of
the country he's campaigning in, saying in Texas he was in favor of
offshore drilling but saying in California he was against it.
   ``George Bush is like a coin: they just flip him and sometimes
he lands on his head, and sometimes he lands on his tail,'' Dukakis
said to the laughter of his audience of 1,000 people.
   Dukakis offered no new proposals in his Little Rock speech,
although aides said he would be making some recommendations over
the next few days in speeches devoted to health insurance and
energy policy.
   Advisers said the first appearance of the campaign swing was
designed to show Dukakis is attuned to the concerns of average
people, and the Democratic presidential nominee was warmly
applauded when he vowed to ``stand up and fight for the average
American family.''
   It contained plenty of robust rhetoric, as well, including the
declaration that the new president ``will inherit a sea of
Republican red ink that not even Moses could part.'' Dukakis did
not say how he would tackle the deficit.
   Dukakis has scaled back his campaign time this week to prepare
for Sunday's televised debate in Winston-Salem, N.C., the first of
two debates.
   Shortly after his plane departed Boston, aides distributed a
written statement reporting that a doctor's examination earlier
this month showed Dukakis to be in ``excellent health.''
   The statement noted that Dukakis suffers from back pain that is
aggravated by long stretches of sitting in airplane seats, and his
doctor has prescribed anti-inflammation medication.
   In his speech in Little Rock, Dukakis depicted an America
``ready to take charge of its future again,'' and said in areas
such as health insurance, education and the environment he would
use the power of government for change.
   Beyond that, he said in a Kennedyesque passage that he would ask
all Americans to bear a ``fair share of the burden of leading
America into a new decade and a new century.''
   Dukakis has been struggling to regain his footing in the race
for the White House after a long period of decline in the polls,
and his traveling group of advisers was expanded for the trip by
several veterans of past Democratic campaigns. Those on board
included Ted Sorenson, a senior adviser to President Kennedy, and
Peter Edelman, who advised Robert Kennedy.
   Whether it was coincidental or not, Dukakis' speech was
delivered to a crowd in the Camelot Hotel and contained echoes of
rhetoric from the two Kennedys.
   He spoke of the need to ``get America moving again,'' foresaw
``new frontiers to conquer,'' and after an attack on ``voodoo
economics,'' he said, ``We can do better than that.''
   Dukakis renewed his criticism of Bush's call for a cut in the
capital gains tax as a ``giveaway'' that would benefit mostly the
wealthy.
   He said that while Bush may be satisfied with the status quo,
``most Americans aren't satified and neither am I.''
   He said prosperity is fragile for ``too many who are treading
water in the rust belt and the farm belt and the oil patch, in our
inner cities and small towns and rural counties.''
   ``Too many Americans, even those with good jobs and with
paychecks that once would have seemed enough, are fearful that they
could be wiped out by one big wave'' such as a long-term illness in
the family or the cost of college education, he said.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis said Monday that eight years of
Republican economic policies had left many Americans fearful of
being wiped out financially. GOP nominee George Bush accused
Dukakis of using ``a strategy of dividing America'' by emphasizing
differences between rich and poor.
   The presidential rivals focused on pocketbook issues as they
began a light week of campaigning in advance of their first
nationally televised debate Sunday in Winston-Salem, N.C. Both
candidates are cutting back on appearances to allow time to study
issues and rehearse for the first of two scheduled debates.
   While attacking each other on the economy, Dukakis and Bush did
not spell out any new economic proposals, although the vice
president voiced support for federal limits on certain types of
liability lawsuits to help businesses curb insurance costs.
   Bush traveled to Bensalem, Pa., where he told the Lower Bucks
County Chamber of Commerce that Dukakis, as governor of
Massachusetts, had an anti-business bias and ``clearly wants to
raise taxes.''
   The vice president said the number of business bankruptcies in
Massachusetts was up 23.7 percent during the first six months of
the year, but on the national level had fallen by 23.5 percent.
   Dukakis campaign manager Susan Estrich said Bush was wrong _
that business failures in Massachusetts actually had declined by 28
percent since Dukakis became governor in 1983, and were less than
half the national rate during the eight years of the Reagan
presidency.
   The campaign also trotted out Massachusetts business leaders to
rebut Bush.
   ``I've been to every state in the union and I can assure you
that there is not a state in the union that comes anywhere near
close to Massachusetts as an environment for growth and
employment,'' said Bernard J. O'Keefe, the chairman of EG&G, an
electronics manufacturers and recently chairman of the National
Association of Manufacturers.
   Bush's vice presidential running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle of
Indiana, echoed Bush during a campaign stop in Knoxville, Tenn.
Quayle said Dukakis had inflicted ``an economic manacle'' on
Massachusetts rather than an economic miracle.
   Later, in Casper, Wyo., Quayle ridiculed what he called Dukakis'
efforts to come across as tough on defense. Referring to Dukakis'
appearance at a Michigan facility where he donned a helmet and
cruised around a tank, Quayle said, ``In just week his defense
policy went from general confusion to Gen. Patton,''
   Brushing aside Dukakis' criticism of GOP economic policies, Bush
said, ``He's begun a calculated strategy of emphasizing differences
between rich and poor, between one region of the country and
another.''
   Bush added, ``He won't win unless he convinces the electorate
that everything is bad in America. I am dismayed by the
divide-and-conquer strategy.''
   The vice president said Dukakis had raised ``all sorts of
taxes'' as governor.
   He mentioned the state income tax, which raised about $70
million when it was linked with the new federal tax code, a sale
tax hike on cigarettes which produced $40 million and a tax break
affecting businesses with fewer than 35 shareholders. Dukakis and
the legislature amended the law to restrict it to corportations
grossing $6 million or less a year _ disqualifying about 750
companies, including some of the state's largest corporations.
   Dukakis, on a two-day swing through the South, said Bush may be
content with the state of the economy but ``most Americans aren't
satisfied and neither am I.''
   In a speech in Little Rock, Ark., Dukakis said, ``After eight
years in power, the Republican Party seems to have exhausted its
reservoir of ideas.''
   The Democratic nominee said prosperity is fragile for ``too many
who are treading water in the rust belt and the farm belt and the
oil patch, in our inner cities and small towns and rural counties.
   ``Too many Americans, even those with good jobs and with
paychecks that once would have seemed enough, are fearful that they
could be wiped out by one big wave'' such as a long-term illness or
the cost of a college education, Dukakis said.
   In a speech in Houston about energy policy, Dukakis said he
would appoint running mate Bentsen to chair a bipartisan energy
summit with congressional leaders. He also accused Bush of
tailoring his positions to the region where he is campaigning,
supporting offshore drilling in Texas but opposing it in California.
   ``George Bush is like a coin: they just flip him and sometimes
he lands on his head, and sometimes he lands on his tail,'' Dukakis
said.
   New polls were released showing Dukakis and Bush in dead heats
in New York and Ohio, which together account for 70 of the 270
electoral votes needed to win the White House. A poll in
Mississippi, with seven electoral votes, gave Bush a substantial
lead.
   Bush, who once trailed Dukakis by 10 percentage points in Ohio,
was favored by 43 percent while Dukakis was supported by 39
percent, in a poll of 667 registered voters taken by the University
of Akron. With a margin of error of 4 percentage points, it was a
statistical dead heat.
   In New York, Dukakis led Bush 48 percent to 42 percent, with an
undecided pool of 10 percent, according to the Marist College
Institute for Public Opinion. The margin of error was put at 4
percent, making it also an effective tie.
   In Mississippi, Bush led Dukakis 49.3 percent to 34 percent. The
survey of 1,000 potential voters by Rick Knox and Associates had a
margin of error of five points.
   A Media General-Associated Press poll, meanwhile, said Americans
see Dukakis as more compassionate and Bush as more competent, but
aren't convinced that either candidate can accomplish most of his
goals as president.
   Only 36 percent of those surveyed said Bush could accomplish
most of his goals as president, and just 31 percent said Dukakis
could achieve most of his goals. Nearly half said either would be
stymied. The rest were not sure.
   After a one-stop campaign foray in Pennsylvania, Bush returned
to Washington where he will spend most of the week on debate
preparation. Press secretary Sheila Tate said former Deputy
Treasury Secretary Richard G. Darman, a key first-term strategist
for President Reagan, would play the part of Dukakis in debate
practice sessions.
   A campaign source said Bush plans to propose a parental job
leave program that would give businesses tax incentives to give
parents time off to care for children after birth or because of
serious illness.
   On the debate front, sources familiar with the negotiations said
Monday the Dukakis campaign has proposed the four network
television news anchors _ one each from CBS, NBC, ABC and CNN _ be
the moderator and panel for each of the presidential debates as
well as the vice presidential face-off.
   But a Republican adviser said such an arrangement would be
unfair to representatives of newspapers and other broadcast outlets.

<TEXT>
   It will be December before this Caribbean
luxury resort returns to normalcy after weathering the strongest
hurricane of the century, hotel executives say.
   But Cancun, which alone represents 20 percent of Mexico's
tourist income, will recover and continue to grow, they said.
   An estimated $40 million in lost hotel room revenue for the
coming weeks is the least of the damage caused by Hurricane Gilbert
as it roared through Mexico's choice resorts on the Yucatan
Peninsula last week.
   Industry officials said they will rush repairs in Cancun to be
ready for the beginning of the high season in December. Other
affected areas include the neighboring islands of Cozumel and Isla
Mujeres.
   Workers were putting ceilings back in the lobby at the Sheraton
and unloading new plants to replace those wiped out by the storm as
still-stranded guests continued to try to find seats on jammed
flights.
   At the 14-story Hyatt Regency, the tallest building on the
strip, architects and engineers huddled with hotel officials in the
lobby to replan remodeling that already had been scheduled.
   About 6,000 tourists were evacuated in the hours just before the
storm last Wednesday and no tourists were among the 31 people
confirmed killed on the Yucatan Peninsula.
   Government officials and hotel people said they were still
gauging physical damage from the storm and the loss of business it
will suffer while repairs are made and the city is cleaned up. No
official estimate was made, but Carlos Constandse, a leading local
hotel owner, said he believed repairs would cost about $100 million.
   ``We have to close in the short term 100 percent,'' Tourism
Secretary Antonio Enriquez Savignac said during a weekend visit
here with President Miguel de la Madrid. ``I believe in two weeks
we will be in a position to begin slowly reopening the hotels. By
the end of November it will be totally repaired.''
   Hotel managers said they were aiming for the Dec. 15 start of
the high season.
   Tourism accounts for 10 percent of foreign exchange and has
helped Mexico survive economic crisis and falling oil prices.
Cancun itself draws 1 million tourists annually and brings in $500
million a year, or 20 percent of tourism income, Enriquez Savignac
said.
   About 90 percent of the tourists are foreigners. The $100 a
night off-season and $160 in-season rates are beyond the means of
all but wealthy Mexicans.
   ``Obviously there's going to be a `down.' The very commercial
restaurants (ones that cater only to tourists) are going to suffer
and give their employees vacations,'' said Paolo Ceravolo, who owns
an Italian restaurant popular with local hotel and construction
executives. ``But by December there will be people.''
   ``There is too much invested (in Cancun) for them (private
investors) to let it fall,'' he said.
   ``We're going to have to lower rates and the people will come,''
said Miguel Loyo, controller of the 1,200-room Hotel Presidente. He
stood in the lobby, its ceiling gone and glittering glass decor
stripped to bare concrete.
   Cancun was a hamlet of fishermen and farmers until 1969, when
the government, using computer analyses of its climate, proximity
to Mayan ruins and other factors, targeted it for development.
Since then, it has boomed to a population of about 200,000. Nearly
all its 45,000 jobs depend on tourism.
   More than 50 of its 111 hotels are strung along a 12-mile ribbon
of powdery white sand dunes, now known as the ``hotel zone,'' that
faces the Caribbean on one side. On the other, lagoons separate it
from the mainland.
   All the hotels on the strip ``were damaged in one way or
another,'' Constandse said. Of 11,000 rooms that were operating at
the time, 30 percent were damaged, he said.
   Gilbert uprooted trees, jerked street lights out from their
concrete bases and bent communications antennae like hairpins.
Windows and glass walls blew out all along the hotel strip _ in
some buildings, virtually all of the windows.
   Wendy Kidd, who was staying in a suite at the Sheraton, said the
wind whipped through the bedroom, going ``in one way and out the
other and took everything with it.''
   ``It took beds, chesterfields. It was completely gutted. It
could have been a fire but nothing was blackened.''
   She said the other rooms in the suite were hardly touched.
   The storm scoured away beaches in some places and built them up
in others. Hotel managers said they understood the shore would
return to its old lines, but were calling in specialists.
   Some of the most severe damage was at the Flamingo Hotel, where
a four-story, eight-room section ripped away and came to rest at a
steep angle at the edge of the sea. A crumbled swimming pool lay at
the ocean's edge and sand was washed from under the main floor of
another section.
   Down the beach, a 118-foot Cuban fishing boat crashed into the
corner of a three-story hotel unit.
   Despite the storm's force, hotel managers said there was little
structural damage and the biggest losses were in the windows and in
decorations.
   Construction under way is expected to add 2,500 rooms by
December and the total is to reach 21,000 in 1989.

   Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, the new leader of Haiti, is
``a political brain'' who has had a role in overthrowing the
nation's last three leaders, said former Haitian President Leslie
Manigat.
   ``Everyone in the army considers him a political brain,''
Manigat said Sunday in an interview here. ``He has been clever
enough to further his military career and emerge as No. 1.''
   Manigat, who fled Haiti after he was ousted from power in a coup
last June, believes Avril played a role in his removal and that of
exiled former President Jean-Claude Duvalier.
   ``He has been a man acting behind the scenes and has now moved
into a new role,'' Manigat said of Avril, who served as chief
counsel to the junta that assumed power after Duvalier fled in
February 1986.
   Manigat, a political science professor elected president in a
widely boycotted election last February, said he was not surprised
that the junta headed by his successor, Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy,
lasted only a few months because of military infighting.
   ``They were too divided among themselves for that to last,''
said Manigat, who lives in Baltimore.

   Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa, who went
to England last week to set up chapters of the group, said Monday
he was stabbed in the face with a handful of darts by a local
``football hooligan'' during his stay.
   Sliwa, speaking an hour after his return to the United States,
said he required 28 stitches in his face after the assault last
Wednesday. Another Guardian Angel, Collins Pompey, also was stabbed
and took six stitches, Sliwa said.
   In London, Scotland Yard said Monday the Guardian Angels leader
was assaulted at a youth club but released no details.
   According to Sliwa, the incident occurred in the Lansdown Green
Community Center in Brixton, where he went to meet with local
residents about forming a chapter of the civilian anti-crime group.
   The meeting was interrupted by ``a group of football hooligans
who didn't take kindly to my presence,'' Sliwa said.
   ``The leader of the group came up to me and stabbed me in the
face with darts, which is a very popular game over there,'' said
Sliwa. Pompey was also attacked by the group, he said.
   No suspects have been arrested in the attack on Sliwa, 34,
Scotland Yard said. Sliwa said he plans to return to England the
week of Oct. 17 to go ahead with his plans to set up Guardian
Angels patrols there.
   Teams of unarmed Guardian Angels sporting red berets and crested
T-shirts patrol dangerous areas of many U.S. cities. They are
trained in martial arts and attempt to make citizens' arrests of
crime suspects, a tactic that authorities say sometimes interferes
with police work and violates the rights of those detained.

   Amnesty International opened its U.S. leg of
its human rights concert tour Monday with a star-studded lineup of
top international rock stars that included Bruce Springsteen and
Sting.
   The ``Human Rights Now!'' tour began late Monday afternoon with
performers singing the late reggae star Bob Marley's ``Get Up,
Stand Up'' to an unenthusiastic crowd at John F. Kennedy Stadium.
By the time Sting took the stage 2{ hours later, the stadium had
filled and the crowd had turned boisterous.
   About 73,000 tickets at $35 each were sold for the concert, held
at the same stadium where 90,000 gathered for the 1985 ``Live Aid''
concert that raised money to fight hunger.
   ``It's very easy for young people to feel helpless, to feel
impotent, to feel they have no influence or control over the world
they are going to inherit. But Amnesty International is a real
beacon of hope,'' British rocker Peter Gabriel said at a news
conference before the concert.
   Gabriel, Tracy Chapman and Senegalese singer Yousoou N'Dour also
were featured, along with American folk singer Joan Baez, and
saxophonist Branford Marsalis.
   Amnesty International launched the worldwide concert tour in
London on Sept. 2 to mark the 40th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, which the United Nations adopted in
1948.
   The London-based Amnesty International, which monitors human
rights abuses and political prisoners, handed out literature and
asked concertgoers for signatures on petitions supporting the
declaration. By halfway through the concert, 40,000 people had
signed, said Amnesty officials.
   Philadelphia, one of the 19 tour stops in 14 countries, is the
first stop in the United States. The tour stops in Los Angeles on
Wednesday and San Francisco on Friday before concerts in Asia,
Africa and South America.
   ``Amnesty International is based on a simple concept: that every
person must and can help to enforce human rights standards,''
Amnesty International official Jack Healey said at the news
conference.
   The performers said they will concentrate on entertaining the
crowd and not on educating the audience about examples of abuse.
   ``The idea is, art poses a challenge. It lets you know what the
issues are, and puts it in your hands to do something about,''
Springsteen said.
   The concert stage was decorated with a 40-foot map of the
Eastern Hemisphere on one side, and a map of the Western Hemisphere
on the other. Between sets, the audience saw an animated video
about the human rights declaration.
   By the time the tour concludes in Buenos Aires on Oct. 15,
organizers expect more than 1 million people to have attended the
concerts. Amnesty officials said the tour was designed to raise
awareness of human rights, not to raise money. The peformers are
donating their time.
   Margaret Farren, a 16-year-old high school student from Belmar,
N.J., went to the concert with about 20 members of an Amnesty
International chapter.
   She said she expected membership to increase as a result of the
tour.
   ``This is definitely going to catch people's attention,'' Ms.
Farren said.

   The U.N. secretary-general delivered a
positive annual report Monday on the eve of the 43rd General
Assembly, praising the world body for peacemaking but warning that
the peacebroker was going broke.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar cited U.N. peacemaking
efforts in Afghanistan, the Iran-Iraq war, Cyprus, Southeast Asia,
South-West Africa and Western Sahara in giving his most optimistic
assessment in years of the 159-nation organization.
   The session opens Tuesday afternoon for election of a president
by secret ballot. A behind-the-scenes fight has been under way.
Foreign Minister Dante Caputo of Argentina and Barbados'
Ambassador, Dame Ruth Nita Barrow, are in close contention.
   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
race was too close to call and several ballots could be held before
one candidate gets a simple majority.
   For the second consecutive year, Perez de Cuellar will not be
there for the opening. He will be bound for South Africa for his
first talks in five years with President P.W. Botha on a regional
peace settlement.
   From there he goes to Angola for more peace talks.
   A fight is expected over the Korean issue during the three-month
General Assembly. The United States and other nations have
sponsored a resolution inviting South Korea to address the assembly
on the 40th anniversary of its founding.
   Both South Korea and communist North Korea have non-voting
observer status and are not permitted to speak during the general
debate, when national leaders address the assembly.
   But the Soviet Union and its socialist friends oppose letting
South Korea speak and on Monday they sponsored a resolution
inviting North Korea to deliver an address.
   Both North and South Korea formed their governments in late
summer of 1948.
   China has not sponsored either resolution but opposes a South
Korean speech.
   The three-week general debate begins Sept. 26 when President
Reagan will deliver his final speech to the world body. His
administration has criticized the United Nations over the years for
bureaucracy, waste and anti-Western bias.
   The session will hear 13 heads of state, six prime ministers and
numerous foreign ministers.
   Among the issues the assembly will discuss is the perennial
problem of the Middle East and the Palestinians. The Palestinian
uprising in the occupied territories that began last Dec. 8 is
expected to produce harsh denunciations of Israel.
   Another anticipated topic is Iraq's refusal to receive a U.N.
chemical experts team to investigate allegations that Iraq violated
international law by using poison gas against its rebellious
Kurdish minority.
   In his annual 21-page work report, released Monday, Perez de
Cuellar likened the United Nations to ``a small boat in which all
the people of the Earth were gathered.'' He said the sails had
caught ``a light, but favorable wind'' and the shore was in sight.
   He cited the U.N.-mediated Afghanistan accords last April; a
U.N.-supervised cease-fire Aug. 20 in the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war;
Iran-Iraq peace talks; a U.N. meeting between Greek and Turkish
Cypriot leaders of the divided Mediterranean island nation of
Cyprus; approaching settlements in Western Sahara; South-West
Africa, or Namibia, and southern Africa, and positive signs in
Southeast Asia.
   But he also pointed to continuing problems in the Middle East,
Central America, southern Africa and the Korean Peninsula. The
issues of disarmament, global economic disparties, human rights
violations and the environment are urgent problems, he said.
   Perez de Cuellar said the United Nations still faces a financial
crisis, despite a U.S. promise to pay $144 million in arrears.
   The U.N. chief said, ``The financial health of the organization
needs to be immediately restored. The United Nations cannot
function without money.''
   He said the U.N. faces both an immediate shortage of cash
``which threatens insolvency in the next few months, and the
virtual depletion of reserves.'' He said this means the U.N. will
not be able to carry out new peacekeeping operations.
   He said he would ask the General Assembly urgently to consider
new ways of raising money, such as voluntary contributions,
interest-free loans and changes in the scale of assessments.
   ``It would be paradoxical and discordant,'' Perez de Cuellar
said, ``if the organization should face financial difficulties
precisely when it has to meet the demands of a more constructive
phase of international affairs.''

   U.S. marshals arrested a fugitive wanted in
a hostage-taking at a newspaper office as he arrived Monday on a
flight from Newark, N.J., with an attorney.
   Marshals grabbed Eddie Hatcher and frisked him in the covered
passageway connecting an arriving Piedmont Airlines plane to a
terminal at Raleigh-Durham Airport. A security officer guarded the
door to the terminal while marshals arrested Hatcher, handcuffed
him and led him to a car waiting on the tarmac.
   Hatcher, whose hair had been cut shorter since his disappearance
last month, wore a bright red shirt, blue jeans, long breech cloth
and Indian-style boots.
   He is charged with violating federal weapons laws and holding up
to 20 people hostage at The Robesonian newspaper in Lumberton on
Feb. 1. Hatcher, who is American Indian, and a second man charged
in the incident said they were protesting alleged corruption and
discrimination against minorities by Robeson County law enforcement
officials.
   Hatcher's arraignment had been scheduled for Monday, and his
brother and sister, Aaron and Ginger Clark, were waiting at the
airport with a limousine. They said they had planned to take their
brother to the federal courthouse in downtown Raleigh for the
hearing.
   However, authorities were watching the flights coming into
Raleigh-Durham and spotted Hatcher first, said U.S. Marshal Bill
Berryhill.
   ``We felt like with his arraignment today he might come in,''
said Berryhill.
   The marshal said he was ``willing to give Hatcher the benefit of
the doubt,'' and believed he was on his way to surrender when he
stepped off the plane at the airport.
   New York attorney Ron Kuby had accompanied Hatcher on the flight
from Newark. Kuby is an associate of lawyer William Kunstler,
well-known for his defense of left-wing activists.
   Ms. Clark watched through a window as officials led her brother
out of the plane and down a stairway to the waiting car. She
sobbed, pounded on the window and waved in an attempt to get her
brother's attention. Hatcher looked up and smiled at her.
   Hatcher was taken to the Cumberland County Jail in Fayetteville,
one county over from Robeson in southeastern North Carolina,
Berryhill said.
   Upon his arrival in Fayetteville, Hatcher was asked where he had
been. He replied: ``Over the rainbow. I had a vacation. I feel real
good. It's time to overthrow the government.''
   While Hatcher was being taken into custody, his case was called
by U.S. District Judge Terrence Boyle. The judge entered an
innocent plea on Hatcher's behalf and set trial for Sept. 26.
   Hatcher, 30, disappeared Aug. 31 after the 4th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals revoked his bond. He was declared a fugitive after
failing to surrender to U.S. marshals in Raleigh.
   Asked where Hatcher had been hiding or if he had been in contact
with his lawyers while a fugitive, Barry Nakell, a Chapel Hill
attorney who's helping represent Hatcher, said, ``I can't say.''
   Berryhill said investigators would pursue information on where
Hatcher has been during the past 20 days ``even though it's rather
academic at this point.''
   ``We'll be talking with Mr. Hatcher right away,'' the marshal
said. ``And we'll be getting with the airlines to determine point
of departure, who bought the plane tickets and so on.''
   U.S. Attorney Margaret Currin and Assistant U.S. Attorney John
Bruce would not comment on possible additional charges against
Hatcher or others who may have helped him.
   Timothy Jacobs, 20, who also is charged in the hostage-taking
incident, surrendered to U.S. marshals in Asheville on Aug. 31.
Jacobs was later transferred to the Wilson County Jail.
   Bruce said Hatcher and Jacobs would be tried together since they
were indicted together and the cases had not been separated by a
judge.
   Hatcher and Jacobs had been released on $100,000 unsecured bond
July 5 after a three-judge panel of the appeals court ruled they
had not been given a bond hearing within five days of their arrest,
as required by law. But the full court voided that decision and set
an Oct. 4 hearing on a prosecution motion challenging bond for the
two men.

   The Foreign Office plans to tell 10 ambassadors
that their envoys must obey the law following a flurry of crimes by
visiting diplomats, officials said Monday.
   The Foreign Office said the ambassadors were being selected as
representatives of geographic regions, rather than as suspected
offenders. The envoys were not immediately identified.
   ``We're asking a number of senior ambassadors to call to enlist
their help and cooperation in putting across to their colleagues
the government's concern at any possible abuse of diplomatic
privilege,'' said a Foreign Office statement.
   The meeting is to be held this week, but no final date was set.
   The carea gun at demonstrators
outside his embassy, and a Tunisian who refused to pay parking
fines.
   The 10 ambassadors will meet with Foreign Office Minister
Timothy Eggar, who expelled both the Cuban diplomat and the Cuban
ambassador, Oscar Fernandez-Mell.
   ``Obey our laws or go home,'' Eggar warned in a column this week
in a London weekly, The Mail on Sunday.
   Eggar revealed that Britain tried unsuccessfully in 1984 to get
an international agreement to modify the 1961 Vienna Convention,
which gives diplomats blanket immunity from prosecution.
   Britain has been particularly touchy about diplomatic crime
since a man firing from the Libyan Embassy at demonstrators killed
a London policewoman in 1984. Libya refused to waive immunity and
Britain severed relations.
   It is widely suspected that violations are occurring of the
Foreign Office ban on diplomats carrying guns and stockpiling arms,
officials say privately.
   London's Sunday Telegraph said this week that the intelligence
service, MI5, ``quietly screens'' diplomatic consignments if arms
are suspected, although this is forbidden under the Vienna
Convention.
   The newspaper said intelligence agents arranged for a recent
shipment of automatic rifles destined for an Arab embassy, which it
did not identify, to be dropped while being unloaded from a
freighter. The ambassador was told to send the rifles home, the
newspaper said.
   Most crimes by the 18,000-strong diplomatic community are
unpublicized and the envoy involved is quietly expelled, with 18
such cases last year and 17 in 1986, the Foreign Office says.
   Recent publicized cases include a Jordanian Embassy waiter
suspected of sex crimes, a Mexican envoy questioned about the
murder of two prostitutes and an Iranian consul expelled on
shoplifting allegations.
   Britain lists the worst offenders for non-payment of parking
fines.
   Egypt headed the 1987 list with 799 unpaid tickets, followed by
the Soviet Union, 622, China, 551 and France with 513.
   Asked to comment, an Egyptian Embassy spokesman did not return
the call.
   Tunisian diplomat Sadok Kassous was expelled because he refused
to pay hundreds of dollars in fines, protesting that insufficient
parking spaces were provided outside the embassy.

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unexpected outpouring of Swedish
anti-immigrant sentiment surfaced Monday in a small town's vote
against accepting refugees.
   In the first referendum of its kind in Sweden, the farming
community of Sjobo rejected a government's request to house and
absorb into the community up to 40 refugees.
   Asked on Sunday whether they would accept the refugees, 6,237
people voted against no and 3,000 voted in favor _ a margin of 2-1.
   The result raised concern that supressed anti-immigration
feelings would emerge in other parts of the country, known for its
generous refugee policy.
   Before the referendum it was widely expected the vote would be
close, with a majority voting in favor, reflecting Sweden's
open-door policies.
   ``This is a sad result. Everyone is a loser,'' said Madeleine
Ramel, head of the social welfare board that would have taken care
of the immigrants. ``It is unfortunate for Sjobo.''
   The referendum coincided with nationwide parliamentary elections
in which the Social Democrats, who have dominated politics for most
of the past 50 years, retained power.
   The result gave the environmental Greens a place in the
349-member Riksdag for the first time. It emerged as the second
strongest Green party in Europe after West Germany.
   The Greens appeared to have taken most of their votes from the
three-party non-socialist bloc which registered its lowest result
since World War II.
   The Social Democrats, supported by the Communists, were in
control with 177 seats. The center-right bloc got 152 and the
Greens got 20.
   The vote in Sjobo was the first open defiance of Sweden's
longstanding policy to provide a home to refugees and give them
language training, job skills, housing, education and other
benefits.
   Last year, 18,000 people sought political asylum in this neutral
nation of 8.4 million, the highest rate in Europe, according to
official figures.
   The immigration authorities routinely ask the country's 284
local governments to receive refugees in an effort to spread
immigrants outside the main cities.
   Most districts have been positive, but the Sjobo council last
autumn voted 25-24 to put the question to a referendum.
   Council Chairman Sven-Olle Olsson, head of the local Center
Party, has been the leader of the fight to keep the immigrants out.
   He has been under pressure to drop the referendum but said it
was a matter of ``democracy'' to hold it. Center Party leaders in
Stockholm have threatened to expel him from the national party.
   Until now, Sweden has not witnessed the right-wing backlash to
large-scale immigration that has appeared in France and neighboring
Denmark and Norway.
   ``It is scary to see that Sweden's humanistic policy actually
has no real support among the people,'' said Signe Jansson, a
midwife in Sjobo who voted yes.
   But officials cautioned against overestimating the significance
of the vote.
   Christina Rogestam, head of immigration, said ``Sweden's refugee
policy does not stand or fall with Sjobo. We believe that all other
districts now will give their support.''
   Center Party leader Olof Johansson said ``Sjobo is special. It
is not like all of Sweden, thank God.''
   Olsson's campaign against refugees may have spurred a jump in
the popularity of the local Center Party, which took 23 seats in a
separate vote for the 49-member council, eight more than it
previously held.

<BYLINE>By VERN ANDERSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOOELE ARMY DEPOT, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army said Monday it was
scaling back plans for a laboratory in western Utah for testing
germ warfare defenses.
   The Army's plans for the biological laboratory at Dugway Proving
Ground had drawn strong opposition from Utah's governor and
congressional delegation and from opponents of research into
genetically altered organisms.
   The Army initially proposed a $5.4 million biological aerosol
test facility with the highest level of containment possible,
``Biosafety Level 4.'' Such a facility is required for experiments
involving genetically altered organisms and diseases for which
there are no vaccines.
   The Army said it had no plans to conduct tests involving such
organisms at the Dugway facility, but it wanted the ability to do
so if the need arose.
   At a news conference Monday, Michael Owen, deputy assistant
secretary of the Army for installation and logistics, said the Army
would instead seek to build a $5 million Level 3 test facility in
1991.
   Level 3 testing involves diseases for which cures exist.
   ``The Army's decision is based on an extensive evaluation of the
requirements for biological defense,'' Owen said. ``Existing Army
BL4 facilities will be used to satisfy any future needs for
material testing that requires a containment level higher than
BL3.''
   The new laboratory would replace an older facility at the
western Utah desert Army installation 70 miles southwest of Salt
Lake City. It would be used to test procedures developed for
defense against an attack with biological materials. The United
States is party to a 1972 treaty that prohibits the offensive use
of biological agents.
   Biological testing has been conducted at Dugway since 1952.
   The announcement was greeted with enthusiasm by Gov. Norm
Bangerter and Utah's congressional delegation, who joined Owen at
the news conference.
   ``I think its a good idea of cooperation between the citizens,
between the governor's office, between the delegation and the Army,
which took it upon themselves to back down considerably on this
effort,'' said Rep. James Hansen, R-Utah.
   Hansen said the new Level 3 facility at Dugway would merely
duplicate testing conducted there since 1952.
   ``I appreciate the Army's new-found willingness to compromise
with the people of Utah and negotiate with me as governor on
matters which affect the state and its citizens,'' Bangerter added.
   Last March, the governor vowed to do all he could to block
construction of the higher-level lab. He told Army officials that
if they intended only to conduct Level 3 experiments, then a Level
3 lab was all that was needed.
   He also threatened to withhold state construction licenses for
the project.
   Owen said the public outcry against the Army's initial plans was
``not the sole determining factor in the decision,'' but he added,
``we try to be good neighbors.''
   Jeremy Rifkin of the Foundation on Economic Trends said Monday
he would fight the Level 3 plan. Rifkin succeeded in getting a
federal court restraining order halting the Army from proceeding
with its original plans pending an environmental impact statement.
   He said his Washington-based lobby contends that plans to build
a Level 3 lab will require still another environmental impact
statement. He said if the Army balks, the foundation will again go
to court.
   Rifkin said the decision not to build a Level 4 lab ``is clearly
a victory for us, because it would stop high-containment work and
gene splicing.
   ``On the other hand, they're apparently planning now to build a
facility that would be less secure while still handling toxic
organisms,'' he said.
   During public hearings last March, witnesses cited a 1966
accident at Dugway with nerve gas that killed 6,000 sheep. While
the Army denied responsibility for the deaths, it paid compensation
to ranchers who lost livestock.
   The news conference was held by Owen, Bangerter and Hansen at
the gate to Tooele Army Depot, where the Army was conducting a
public hearing later Monday night for its biological defense
research program.

   A high school principal says he's encouraged by
the success of a dress code aimed at stopping thefts, violence, and
expensive rivalry some students can't afford.
   There are no gold chains and bracelets or designer sunglasses
allowed at the 2,500-student Mumford High School, which gained
notice through T-shirts worn by Eddie Murphy in the film ``Beverly
Hills Cop.''
   Pupils also are minus their tank tops, jogging suits,
snakeskin-adorned gym shoes and like finery.
   ``I'm a pro-active administrator, not a reactive one,''
Principal Robin E. Oden said. ``I see and hear about the youngsters
being shot over gold chains as they walk to and from school.
   ``My kids (students) have been harassed. Recognizing that, I
want to make sure that it doesn't spill over into the school.''
   Two 17-year-old boys were wounded by gunfire last year in
Detroit after one was robbed of a blue sheepskin jacket. Three
years ago, a 13-year-old was shot in the chest after giving his
popular gym shoes to five youths who demanded them.
   Oden said the policy has been successfully enforced this school
year without any suspensions.
   ``About 98 percent of my students adhere to the dress code to
the letter,'' he said.
   Some students were spotted near the school recently wearing gold
or other expensive jewelry and other banned items. They said they
stashed it during the day and then wore it home.
   Oden said such a tactic resulted in a recent robbery of a
14-year-old student.

   Haiti's deposed
president, Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, kept to himself Monday in a
guarded hotel suite on his second day in forced exile.
   ``The general has repeated his decision not to speak to
reporters. He has said he has nothing to say,'' one guard told a
reporter.
   Guards maintained tight security outside the sixth-floor suite
in the Dominican Concorde Hotel where Namphy, his wife, Gabrielle,
and his daughter, Melissa, were staying.
   A hotel employee said Namphy and his family have eaten all meals
in their rooms and have refused to accept phone calls.
   Security agents have prohibited reporters, photographers and
cameramen from visiting the sixth floor of the hotel.
   Security was even tighter at the Haitian Embassy, where
anti-riot police armed with automatic weapons stood guard to
prevent demonstrations.
   Namphy arrived Sunday from Haiti, which shares the island of
Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic, after being deposed by
non-commissioned officers and soldiers of his own Presidential
Guard, a 1,000-man unit that has been instrumental in Haiti's last
two coups.
   Namphy and others had sought political asylum at the Dominican
Republic Embassy in the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince. Haiti's
last exiled president, the civilian Leslie Manigat, also stayed in
the Dominican Concorde when he was overthrown and sent into exile
in June by Namphy.
   Namphy received his first visitor Monday, the Dominican deputy
foreign minister, Fabio Herrera Cabral, who met with the deposed
general for about 30 minutes in his hotel suite.
   Herrera Cabral later told reporters Namphy's visa was good for
only two months. He said it was a ``courtesy'' document issued to
visitors.
   Local newspapers speculated that Namphy was making arrangements
to fly to France, as did Manigat after his ouster from the
presidency by the now-deposed general. The reports could not be
confirmed.
   Santo Domingo's La Noticia newspaper reported Monday that Namphy
was seen limping when he arrived at the hotel Sunday and that he
complained of pain in his right leg. It also quoted an unidentified
hotel employee as saying that the lights in Namphy's suite were
turned on several times during the night and that Namphy asked an
orderly to bring him aspirin.
   Rafael Bello Andino, an aide to President Joaquin Balaguer, said
Monday that the Dominican Republic will continue monitoring events
in Haiti.
   A source at the Foreign Ministry said discussions are continuing
to decide the fate of 12 people granted asylum in the embassy.
   Although the identities of the 12 have not been confirmed,
Port-au-Prince Mayor Franck Romain is believed among them.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Advocates of democratic reform
expressed hope that Haiti's new military leaders would open a
dialogue with the people after ousting Lt. Gen. Henry Namphy, who
ran the country for more than two years.
   Brig. Gen. Prosper Avril, the army's chief administrative
officer, went on national television Sunday and declared himself
president of the Western hemisphere's most impoverished nation.
   He said Namphy was ousted by the 1,000-man Presidential Guard
Saturday night because it was ``sickened'' by his rule, which was
marked by a tolerance for the murder of government opponents.

   Average SAT scores lost ground in 1988 for the

   Trevor Pinnock's debut as an operatic conductor
at the Metropolitan Opera has already raised eyebrows but, the
British early music specialist says, ``You've got to start
somewhere. Why not here?''
   Pinnock will conduct Handel's ``Giulio Cesare,'' which premieres
Tuesday with Kathleen Battle as Cleopatra and Tatiana Troyanos as
Caesar. Jeffrey Walker, in the role of Ptolemy, is the first
countertenor (male alto) to appear at the Met.
   The more significant first for the Met is having an early music
specialist in the pit. Pinnock, who founded and directs the English
Concert, is one of Britain's best-known workers in the original
instruments field, along with Christopher Hogwood and John Eliot
Gardner.
   However, the announcement that Pinnock would conduct ``Giulio
Cesare'' provoked some critical grousing last season. Donal
Henahan, chief music critic of The New York Times, ended a
laudatory review of one of Pinnock's performances with this warning
shot: ``Followers of the Metropolitan Opera must wonder what
qualifies Mr. Pinnock to conduct next season's `Julius Caesar.'''
   ``The trouble is, people are always ready to pigeonhole
everybody,'' Pinnock said before rehearsal recently.
   ``I've done `Giulio Cesare'; I've done it with students on stage
in London. But the fact is, I've never conducted in an opera house
before,'' he said.
   ``I do know the music through and through, I love the music of
Handel, and I love working with singers... In a certain way, all
music is sung. I hate music that doesn't breathe.''
   Pinnock, 41, has been performing professionally since 1966, and
he formed the English Concert in 1973.
   The Met has only been doing Handel since 1983, when ``Rinaldo''
entered the repertory, followed by an operatic version of the
oratorio ``Samson'' in 1985.
   This production of ``Giulio Cesare'' was done by John Copley for
the English National Opera in 1978 with Charles Mackerras
conducting.
   Pinnock is not working with original instruments at the Met, but
with a small orchestra _ 18 violins, six cellos, three basses and
harpsichord _ of modern instruments.
   The early music influence will come in the style of playing,
especially the ornamentation in both the instrumental and vocal
parts.
   ``Of course, it has been paramount in my musical considerations
_ the combination of what Handel wants and how to fill the hall,''
Pinnock said.
   ``It's interesting how much that's affected ornamentation. I
have quite strong ideas about the type of ornamentation that is
suitable for a large space, as opposed to a small room. I think the
ornamentation in general needs more space. It can't be tight and
fast ornamentation.''
   It also has to suit the voice.
   ``I've found that I've had to write quite different
ornamentation, in some cases, for cover singers,'' Pinnock said.
``Because, obviously, one is trying to solve two things in
ornamentation: first, and foremost for me, one's trying to enhance
the meaning of the words and the whole sense of the aria. If the
ornamentation doesn't do that, it's completely wasted notes.
Secondly, it is to show off the voice, and it must be to show off
the beautiful qualities of whoever is singing it.''
   ``Giulio Cesare'' premiered in London in 1724, and was revised
and revived in 1725, 1730 and 1732. Following its last German
performances in 1733, it disappeared from the repertory until the
1920s.
   Restoring the reputation of Handel's more than three dozen
operas has become a cause for his partisans. Winton Dean and John
Merrill Knapp, in a monumental scholarly survey of Handel's operas
published last year, contended that ``Handel ranks with Monteverdi,
Mozart and Verdi among the supreme masters of opera.''
   Pinnock said Handel's operas have unfairly gained a reputation
for being static. That has something to do with the limitations of
the ``opera seria'' form of recitatives mixed with ``da capo''
arias _ solos which have two movements, repeating the first.
   Pinnock sees ``Giulio Cesare'' as a series of pictures, in which
the audience is invited to take part.
   ``The `da capo' aria, musically, enhances the meaning of the
words,'' he said. ``So what we've begun to understand in the
beginning _ we've entered the picture _ then we're fully in
accordance with what's being sung and can relish the atmosphere
before moving on to the next picture.
   ``Now, of course, it is possible in a certain production to make
it so static that we as the audience are not invited in. But I
believe that the good production of a Handel opera will at the same
time honor that concept of the picture and not destroy it by
ridiculous movement.''
   Among Pinnock's future projects is next season's launching of
``The Classical Band'' in New York, an original instruments
orchestra of 40 or 50 players which will have guest conductors.
``Leonard Bernstein wants to have a go,'' Pinnock said, though
that's not yet definite.
   He says he wants to be free to perform any kind of music, though
Pinnock admits some limitations.
   ``I'm not good enough at playing jazz, which upsets me a lot,
because I feel I should be but I don't know the language well
enough.
   ``I've always held that at their best moments the bands of Basie
and Ellington showed how a band should work, and that's the same
sort of basis as my little orchestra, the English Concert. ...
   ``As a director one has to set up the best framework for the
individual musicians to play even better than they know how. That
was the great art of Count Basie, who didn't always have the
greatest soloists, but he often managed to make it possible for
them to play even better than one would expect.''

   Suzhou is the name of a nearby city of
gardens known for its beauty; it also is the name of a creek in
Shanghai known for its ugliness.
   Suzhou Creek, whose waters once abounded in clams and crabs and
were prized by ancient winemakers, today is Shanghai's most glaring
symbol of a pollution problem that endangers the health of its 12
million citizens.
   Officials fear the creek's pollution and stench also could scare
off foreigners willing to invest in the rebirth of Shanghai as a
leading center of industry and commerce.
   But the government has begun to act.
   Construction began in August of a $432-million pipeline project
to divert the raw sewage now discharged into Suzhou Creek and
flowing into the Huangpu River, Shanghai's main waterway.
   Qiu Xingyan, chief engineer of the Pollution Control Division in
the city's Environmental Protection Bureau, said the system will
transport the garbage into the Yangtze River Estuary north of
China's largest city.
   ``I was a little worried at first about shifting pollution from
the Suzhou to the Yangtze,'' Qiu said in an interview, but stressed
that the sewage will be treated and won't affect water quality in
the Yangtze.
   Shanghai last year completed a $162-million project to move
treatment stations for the city's drinking water into less
contaminated waters further up the Huangpu River.
   Raw garbage still flows into water used for drinking and more
money must be spent in the future to move water stations upstream.
But there has been an improvement over the recent past, when every
glass of drinking water was one-third chlorinated sewage.
   During the Song Dynasty (960-1279), winemakers used water from
the Suzhou, then called the Wusong, for high-quality wine. But by
the 1920s, with Shanghai fast rising as the commercial and
industrial center of China, the river was already badly polluted,
its fish and crabs dying off.
   Today the 77-mile river snakes through industrial, working-class
neighborhoods of Shanghai, finally dumping the refuse of textile
and chemical factories into the Huangpu along the city's famed
waterfront Bund.
   In contrast to the deathlike dun of its surface, the Suzhou
churns with activity. Hundreds of flatboats ply the waters, loading
clothing and shoes, some bound for overseas markets, and unloading
televisions and other consumer goods.
   The fumes from old trucks compete with the odors wafting from
the river. Suzhou Creek is only the most pungent example of
Shanghai's water pollution problems, regarded as the worst in China.
   Zhang Mingyo of the city Environmental Protection Research
Institute said Shanghai's 10,000 factories every day dump 5 million
tons of largely untreated sewage into branches of the Huangpu.
   City environmentalists even keep tabs of the ``stink factor'' on
the Huangpu, and last year the river registered 150 foul-smelling
days.
   More seriously, scientists believe Shanghai's high rates of
stomach, liver and esophagal cancer are linked to poor water
quality. In the first half of this year 30 people died and 300,000
were sickened from a major outbreak of hepatitis in the city caused
by contaminated clams.
   The experts acknowledge that the pollution problem in Shanghai
became worse after the Communist takeover in 1949 and has become
even more serious with China's economic takeoff in the 1980s.
   The State Environmental Protection Bureau has estimated that
more than 29,000 miles of China's waterways have been contaminated
by industrial pollution. Although environmental protection laws
have been enacted, the state lacks both the money for pollution
controls and the will to slow the pace of the nation's
modernization drive.
   Estimates are that Shanghai, already reeling from the costs of
rebuilding its antiquated industries and woefully inadequate
infrastructure, will need $4 billion by the turn of the century to
reach national standards on water and air pollution.
   The city now fines factories that exceed limits on the density
of the garbage they discharge, although it does not regulate the
amount of sewage released. It will also charge fees for use of the
new Suzhou pipeline and others planned to be built by the year
2000, the Pollution Control Division's Qiu said.
   Qiu added the new pipeline will handle only 40 percent of the
sewage now discharged into the Suzhou.
   But he said the city plans to eliminate the smell by the year
2000 and hopes that one day fish will return to the Suzhou.
   The project is important to Shanghai, he said, because
foreigners who see and smell Suzhou Creek may be reluctant to
invest in the city's development.
   Cleaning up the creek, he said, ``will be helpful for the image
of Shanghai.''

   The diaries of two Israeli soldiers offer
sharply conflicting accounts of how the Israeli army deals with the
nine-month-old Palestinian uprising on the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   But at the same time, the diairies published in the Jerusalem
Post mirror the broad differences in Israeli society itself on how
to quell the rebellion.
   One soldier, a reservist, wrote that troops were taught to beat
Arabs with ``dry blows'' that cause pain but draw no blood.
   The other said his reserve duty in the Gaza Strip's Jabaliya
refugee camp convinced him that despite occasional abberations,
soldiers were ``restrained and noble men.''
   ``The Israeli army remains one of the most decent in the
world,'' the second soldier, American-born free-lance writer Louis
Rapoport, wrote of his 30 days of duty in the crowded camp of
70,000 refugees in June.
   But the other, British-born educator Jonathan Kestenbaum,
described a ``tremendous callousness'' among many of the soldiers
he served with in the West Bank village of Qabatiyeh in August.
   ``Among the soldiers, there is a depressing routine of almost
wild abandon. Everybody here makes up their own rules,'' Kestenbaum
wrote in his diary.
   Kestenbaum, 29, described an encounter with an Israeli guard at
a detention center in Jenin, north of Jerusalem.
   ``How many dogs have you brought?'' Kestenbaum quoted the guard
as asking him when he arrived with a group of teen-age Palestinian
detainees.
   He added: ``Once the man opposite you is a dog, anything goes.''
   Rapoport conceded troops were sometimes responsible for
``accidents or misjudgments,'' including a case where an Israeli
soldier made a firebomb and intended to hurl it at Arab
demonstrators. His officers confiscated it.
   But, he wrote, many soldiers were frustrated because they felt
the Palestinians had a propaganda edge by sending boys as young as
9 years old to the front lines of stone-throwing riots to take on
armed troops.
   ``The scores of men in the reserve company I served with ... are
portrayed in the world media as part of a Goliath machine versus
little David with his puny stones,'' Rapoport wrote.
   Addressing the same issue, Kestenbaum wrote of a 15-year-old
Palestinian killed by a member of his unit: ``Why are we using live
bullets on teen-agers throwing stones?''
   Kestenbaum told of chasing a 9-year-old boy who broke a 30-day
curfew to try to retrieve bread from a gutter and of rounding up a
group of elderly Palestinians who slipped into a field at night to
pick a bucket of tomatoes rotting in the fields.
   ``Our jeep springs into action, chasing this family as if the
very future of our country depended on it. We corner them,''
Kestenbaum wrote. ``At which point the old woman, 90 years old,
falls to her knees, kisses my hand and begs me not to (detain) her:
`We really needed tomatoes,' she says.''
   ``These are vulgar, unnecessary situations which humiliate them
and degrade us,'' Kestenbaum added.
   Both Kestenbaum and Rapoport described the shooting deaths of
Palestinians during their tours but had markedly different
reactions to the killings. Since the uprising began, 266
Palestinians and six Israelis have died.
   ``I doubt whether any other army in the world ... would act with
more restraint,'' Rapoport said, adding that he considered the Arab
fatalities in the uprising to be ``remarkably low given the scale
of the revolt.''
   Kestenbaum offered this observation about a soldier in his unit
who killed a Palestinian teen-ager: ``The guy who fired the shots
was the same guy who spent three days at our training base talking
of beating up Arabs. (The death) didn't really affect him one way
or the other.''

<HEAD>South African Government Facing Stormy Local Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Punctuated by violence and
black defiance, the campaign for local elections in South Africa is
developing into a high-stakes showdown between the government and
its adversaries.
   Two powerful challenges, from opposite directions, threaten to
foil the government's hopes for political and public-relations
triumphs Oct. 26, when for the first time, voters of all races go
to the polls on the same day.
   Black anti-apartheid clergymen are defying emergency regulations
by urging a boycott of the elections, which they view as an
entrenchment of segregated, white-controlled political structures.
   Among whites, the far-right Conservative Party, which depicts
even minimal reforms by the government as surrender to the black
majority, is campaigning vigorously for an intensification of
apartheid. It is favored to win control of most white municipal
councils in two of the four provinces, including Transvaal, the
most populous.
   President P.W. Botha's National Party, which rejects black
participation in national elections, says in its campaign leaflets
that the local elections prove ``democratic participation for all
has become a reality.''
   Information Minister Stoffel van der Merwe suggests that the
turnout among registered black voters could reach 40 percent, in
contrast to about 20 percent in the previous black local elections
in 1983.
   To maximize the turnout, the government is spending hundreds of
thousands of dollars on advertising. In a series of print and
television ads, a pair of squirrels discuss the virtues of voting;
billboards in white and black communities bear the slogan: ``You
Can Make It Happen. Vote Oct. 26.''
   A black newspaper columnist, Joe Latakgomo, wrote of the slogan:
``Nobody has got around to telling me what it is I can make
happen.''
   Predicting that militants will try to intimidate would-be black
voters, the government will allow ballots to be cast in advance by
virtually anyone who asks to do so. Critics claim this ``prior
vote'' system could be easily abused to produce fraudulent turnout
statistics in townships where few voters show up on election day.
   Roughly half the 26 million blacks are not allowed to vote
because they are considered citizens of semi-autonomous or
nominally independent homelands. Hundreds of thousands of other
blacks are ineligible for other reasons. These include residents of
illegal squatter camps and servants who live at their employers'
homes in white areas.
   In some black townships, the nomination deadline expired with no
candidates entering the election. In many other townships, most
candidates are running unopposed and will take office for five-year
terms no matter how low the turnout. Nowhere are prominent black
anti-apartheid activists seeking office.
   Several major black opposition groups have been banned from
functioning since February, and dozens of activists have been
detained.
   In June, the government outlawed calls for election boycotts;
those who do can be sentenced to prison terms as long as 10 years.
   A leading black newspaper, The Sowetan, has responded by
rejecting ads promoting the election.
   Archbishop Desmond Tutu of the Anglican Church has risked
prosecution by telling blacks that the election is ludicrous and
will ``perpetuate your oppression.''
   Unsigned pamphlets distributed in townships denounce blacks
running for office as ``a bunch of crooks, murderers and highly
paid apartheid agents ... who should be met with the people's
anger.''
   One black candidate, David Nkomo, was assassinated in Soweto in
August by two unidentified gunmen. Earlier, assailants threw hand
grenades at a rally organized by Nkomo's Sofasonke Party, and
candidates' homes were set afire in the Cape Province township of
Bhongolethu.
   A Johannesburg security company is conducting one-day workshops
in major cities, costing the equivalent of nearly $200 per
participant. Civil defense and bomb-disposal experts provide advice
on countering ``the possible increase in terrorist activities''
before the election.
   For most of the 5 million whites, the drama surrounding the
black elections is overshadowed by the Conservative Party's assault
on the National Party, which has held power for 40 years.
   The Conservatives, who won 26 percent of the vote in 1987
general elections, believe whites are confused by Botha's reform
program and prefer the clarity of an unabashed pro-segregation
policy.
   Many analysts predict the Conservatives will take control in
every white municipality in Transvaal except Johannesburg and a few
suburbs. Even Pretoria, the national capital, is expected to be
lost by the National Party.

   A cat and a mouse first brought Bill Hanna
and Joe Barbera together 50 years ago, and a whole menagerie helped
them become television's foremost cartoon animators.
   ``We did every frame of the first `Tom and Jerry' in 1939,''
said Barbera. ``Then MGM decided we had exhausted all the story
ideas about a cat and mouse. So for the next 20 years, all we did
was turn out `Tom and Jerry' cartoons.'''
   The ``Tom and Jerry'' cartoons won seven Academy Awards, more
than any other series with the same characters. Jerry's dance with
Gene Kelly in ``Anchors Aweigh'' has become a screen classic.
   ``Then they folded the animation department, and Joe and I were
out of work,'' said Hanna. ``We set up our own studio at our homes
and went to work. The first thing we did was `Ruff and Reddy.'''
   In the 30 years since, Hanna-Barbera has filled the television
screen with such animated series as ``The Flintstones,'' ``Yogi
Bear,'' ``Huckleberry Hound and Friends,'' ``Top Cat,''
``Scooby-Doo,'' ``Johnny Quest,'' ``The Jetsons'' and ``Animal
Follies.'' Fred Flintstone's ``yabba dabba doo'' and Yogi's
``smarter than the average bear'' entered the language.
   Hanna-Barbera has received eight Emmys, including the Governors
Award of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences presented last
month. They were awarded a ``Just Say No'' commendation from first
lady Nancy Reagan for an ABC special last week.
   Their first effort for television was shown to Harry Cohn, then
the head of Columbia Pictures.
   ``We did a pencil test of `Ruff and Reddy,''' said Barbera. ``We
photographed the pencil sketches and screened it for Cohn. He
didn't know what a pencil test was. He walked out and told an
assistant to get rid of us. Fortunately, the assistant ignored the
order, and we did 52 shorts for a Saturday morning show.''
   They knew the times had changed when the budget for their first
television show was $2,800. The ``Tom and Jerry'' cartoons had cost
$50,000 each.
   Neither the white-haired Hanna nor the dark-haired Barbera had
set out to be cartoonists. Hanna studied engineering and journalism
in his native New Mexico. He got into animation in 1931 when he
needed work. Barbera, who grew up in Brooklyn, first entered
banking but soon turned his doodles into magazine cartoons and then
into a job as an animator.
   The original name of ``The Flintstones'' was ``The Flagstones,''
but the couple in the ``Hi and Lois'' newspaper comic strip was
named Flagston.
   ``I think it worked out better because `The Flintstones' is a
better name,'' said Barbera. ``When we came up with `Yogi Bear'
they tried to stop us because there was a honeybear on a box of
cereal. We wouldn't have done `Tom and Jerry' if we'd listened to
people.''
   Their most widely accepted cartoon series has been ``The
Flintstones,'' which Hanna readily admits was a pre-historic parody
of Jackie Gleason and Art Carney in ``The Honeymooners,'' just as
Yogi Bear resembled Phil Silvers as Sgt. Bilko in ``You'll Never
Get Rich.''
   ``You can read a lot into it,'' said Hanna. ``You can compare
Fred and Barney Rubble with Gleason and Carney.''
   Barbera added: ``We had a lot of pre-historic and animal gags.
The show really took off when Wilma had a baby and we had a contest
to name the baby. The Ideal Toy Co. called and asked what the baby
was going to be. I said, `A boy, of course. A chip off the old
rock.'
   ``The man from the toy company said if we'd make it a girl he'd
give us a lucrative contract for dolls. We changed it to a girl on
the spot. We had the contest and the baby became Pebbles.''
   Hanna and Barbera have selected their personal favorites and
will release six 90-minute videocassettes.
   ``Tom and Jerry'' will not be on the videos because the rights
are owned by Turner Broadcasting System. However, the cartoon is
coming full circle. Hanna-Barbera will do a full-length motion
picture cartoon of ``Tom and Jerry.'' The script has been completed
and it will go into production in a few years, after the studio
completes a feature film of ``The Jetsons.''
   ``Yogi Bear'' is now a daily show being syndicated to about 80
percent of the nation.

<HEAD>When Buying a Country Home, Water Is Vital Consideration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In this year of the drought millions of
Americans have discovered the fickleness of water supplies. It's a
concern that needs to be kept in mind by anyone considering a rural
residence, whether farmer or commuter.
   In the last decade or so many long-time city dwellers have moved
into the sometime greener pastures of rural America.
   These relocations can offer many benefits, but they also pose
problems the urbanite may not have thought of, with water supplies
and sewage disposal atop the list.
   ``Prospective homeowners need to know about the terrain, the
proximity of the house to other structures, and the condition of
the well and septic system,'' says Roger M. Waller, a hydrologist
with the U.S. Geological Survey.
   ``If building in an unpopulated area, drill a well first,'' he
advises, ``or if buying an old house, find out if the water supply
is adequate.''
   Rural homeowners sometimes find out too late that the well
drilled on their land doesn't provide enough water or that what is
available is of poor quality.
   Waller is the author of a new booklet, ``Ground Water and the
Rural Homeowner,'' designed to explain the fundamentals of
undergound water supplies. It discusses how water moves through the
ground, the most common types of wells, and methods to solve or
prevent common well and septic-system problems.
   Single copies of the 37-page booklet are available at no charge
by writing to the U.S. Geological Survey, Books and Open-File
Reports Section, Box 25425, Denver, CO, 80225.
   When considering buying rural property, get to know the area
well and, if possible, in all weather conditions, Waller cautions.
   ``Try to visit the site under adverse conditions, such as during
heavy rain or meltwater runoff, to observe the drainage
characteristics, particularly the condition of the basement,'' he
says.
   It is also important to learn what types of business or other
activities may have been in the area in the past.
   For example, Waller notes that while orchards are picturesque,
they are often treated with chemicals to prevent disease and insect
infestation. These chemicals eventually settle into the soil and
can enter the ground water. The same type of problems can occur in
areas previously used for vegetable farms.
   In northern areas, salt and other chemicals spread on highways
in the winter can enter the water supply, and other potential
hazards include oil spills, natural gas in wells, bacteria from
septic tanks and barnyard runoff and fertilizers.
   Some mortgage lenders require a negative bacteria test of well
water before making a loan, but even if that isn't required it is
important to have the test done, Waller stresses.
   Also important to the buyer is a well record or log, which
describes the well's characteristics, including yield and the type
of materials that the driller encountered. This should include such
information as well depth, water level, type of pump, pump-intake
setting and yield.
   ``Although potential water problems for the rural homeowner can
sometimes be expensive, pose a health hazard, or possibly affect
real estate values, these problems can be avoided by the observant,
informed buyer or owner,'' concluded Waller.

   As a youth, Loyall Newell found a home in the
pool hall. A shaky beginning? Maybe, but what it led to was a
career as a rare combination of historian, artisan and hustler.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By JULES LOH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CLAY CENTER, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Back during the Great Depression,
Loyall Newell's father thought his son frittered away entirely too
much time hanging around the pool hall. It turns out it wasn't a
misspent youth after all.
   ``My dad would pay me $30 a week to help out in his garage,''
Newell recalls. ``I could make that in half a day on a snooker
table.''
   At 63, Newell still shoots a mean stick, as they say over at the
Idle Hour, where Newell had idled away many an hour in his young
manhood. He'll still take on anybody in Kansas at three-cushion
billiards, you name the bet.
   It is not his artistry with a cue stick, though, that has
brought him the big payoff. It is artistry of another kind.
   Today Loyall Newell is one of America's leading authorities on
pool tables, and one of only a handful in the land able to restore
to its original romantic luster one of those heavy old carved and
inlaid beauties built more than a century ago.
   ``We're not talking about just refinishing,'' he says, ``we're
talking about restoring. I replace missing parts with original
parts because I have the parts. Not many others do. Then I refinish
it.''
   Right now he's busy restoring a table that has been in the
Kansas governor's mansion for generations and is getting ready to
restore another that Mark Twain played on at his home in Elmira,
N.Y. Newell's handiwork decorates private rec rooms and fancy clubs
in a dozen states.
   Ironically, Loyall Newell's good fortune results from what many
perceive as a great American misfortune, the demise of the family
farm.
   After World War II, when small farmers by the thousands began
leaving the land for better paying factory jobs, rural towns across
the plains withered and died. The local pool hall was often the
first to board up its windows.
   ``This was happening when I got out of the Navy,'' Newell
recalls.
   ``I had a feeling somebody was going to want all those pool
tables some day, so I started buying them up for practically
nothing. Besides, I just like pool tables, those old ones. I think
they're beautiful. Historic, you might say.
   ``The first ones I bought were four old mahogany tables from a
place over in Geary County. I also took all the cues and racks and
equipment, and the back bar and front bar to boot. Paid $60 for the
whole shebang. Some owners gone broke would be glad to take $25 a
table just to have me cart them away.
   ``I did that all around Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma,
bought out 75 or 80 pool halls. It turned out I was right. I could
get $200 or $300 apiece for them, depending on the condition, from
people who wanted a fancy table for their homes. I put more than
350 tables in Kansas City alone, another 75 or 80 in Topeka.''
   It was still only a sideline. Newell had bought the Idle Hour
and ran it along with holding a part-time job in the post office.
   Then one day in the late '50s an antiques dealer from the West
Coast came through Clay Center and offered Newell $800 for four
tables Newell had picked up for $200. Not bad at all. Quadrupled
his money.
   But Newell later learned that the dealer had refinished the
tables and sold them in Los Angeles for $3,500 each.
   ``There I was with a warehouse full of tables and boxes of
parts, boxes stacked on boxes. That's when I decided to get in the
restoring business. Not refinishing, restoring.''
   The business grew to more than Newell could keep up with. He
sold the Idle Hour, retired from the post office, and some years
ago his son, Joe, quit his job and joined his father in what became
Newell Billiard Supply Co. People in the pool table business also
refer to it as the Smithsonian Institution of pool halls.

   That is because, along with all those accumulated tables and
parts, Newell also has assembled what he believes is the nation's
most complete collection of pool table records and catalogs. They
begin with the first ones put out by Brunswick-Balke-Collender Co.,
America's oldest and largest manufacturer.
   ``The company changed management half a dozen times and lost
most of its records in floods and fires,'' Newell says. ``So now
they come to us to answer their inquiries. We're their official
consultants.
   ``What happens usually is that somebody will inherit or discover
an old beat-up table with a cracked slate and the Brunswick name on
it.
   ``They ask Brunswick whether it's worth fixing. Brunswick refers
them to us. We tell them to take pictures of the end and side
panels and send us the pictures. We tell them what it is and when
it was made and how much it will cost to restore it.''
   Leafing through the catalogs, Newell pointed out that there have
been scores of designs over the years, many of them with names like
war cries: Nonpareil! Eclipse! Monarch! Exposition! The catalogs
also include specially designed tables for individuals, such as
John D. Rockefeller and a number of foreign nabobs.
   An old Monarch table, catalog price $475 in 1875, now in top
condition can fetch as much as $35,000 to $50,000.
   Often the price of a restored table reflects not only Newell's
skill but the scarcity of antique parts.
   ``Here's a bolt,'' he said, reaching into a drawer. ``It holds
the slate to the frame. It has 14 threads per inch. Not 12, not 16.
They're what came in the original tables and nobody makes exactly
the same ones nowadays. Use any other and you'll break the slate.''
   Newell's shop is a wonderful scene of organized disorder,
redolent with odors of hide glue, raw wood and linseed oil, the
smells of creation. Only two or three restoration projects are on
the floor at any one time. About 85 more tables await rebirth in a
warehouse, work to be done between special orders and sold to any
bidder.
   ``You never know what sort of person the customer will be,
Newell said. ``We fixed up a table for a man in Eureka Springs,
Ark., charged him $7,140. When I delivered it he paid me in $20
bills.''
   Newell, at his work, is a model of patience. He does the tedious
jobs, leveling, sanding, rubbing, without complaint. In no hurry,
he might take an occasional work break, for old time's sake, and
shoot a rack of nine ball at the Idle Hour, which happens to be
right next door.
   Thanks to his memories of youth and his loving care, the Idle
Hour appears today just as it did in 1936 when it was built. No
coin-operated pool tables here, all classics, and a classic bar
worn silk smooth by elbows.
   Clay Center, out in remote northeastern Kansas with a population
of about 5,000, is one farm town that hasn't yet gone under and
boarded up its pool hall. It would be like boarding up a shrine.
   Newell picked up the skills of wood finishing just as he learned
pool shooting, by experimenting, asking around, discovering some
tricks of his own.
   ``When I was a boy shining shoes at the Idle Hour,'' he said,
``I used green pool table cloth for that final shine. It popped
nice and did the job.
   ``Know what I use now to polish wood? My old shoeshine brushes.
Yep, I still have them. I didn't throw them away.
   ``Come to think of it,'' he said, ``I don't believe I've ever
thrown anything away.''

   An Irish-Catholic with a law degree, John Loftus
was moving up in the ranks of the Justice Department when he joined
a special unit created to find and deport Nazi war criminals living
in the United States, figuring it would help his career. But Loftus
became obsessed with the hunt and when his superiors tried to rein
him in, he decided it was time to pursue the investigation on his
own. It was a costly decision.

   Sometimes John Loftus wishes he had
simply walked out of the classified government vaults 10 years ago
and turned his back forever on his knowledge of Nazis living
quietly in the United States.
   By this time, Loftus figures he could have been a veteran
Justice Department prosecutor or perhaps he might have started a
lucrative law practice in his home state of Massachusetts. He
thinks he might have even spared his wife a disabling injury, and
that he might have been able to keep his spacious Rockland home.
   Instead, Loftus' search into documents showing Nazi officers and
sympathizers smuggled to the West as anti-Communist informants led
to his resignation from a special federal Nazi-prosecution unit in
1981. That's when he began his one-man probe into the government's
collaboration with fugitive Nazis.
   His quest has been costly.
   Loftus' research and travel is barely covered by his magazine
articles and royalties from his 1982 book, ``The Belarus Secret,''
which chronicles the paths taken to the West by Nazis who led the
massacre of nearly 40,000 Jews in the Byelorussian section of
Eastern Europe.
   His wife was left partially crippled after a 1983 attack at a
psychiatric hospital, where she had taken a job to help pay bills.
He had to put his home up for sale. A Kentucky-based fund for
Loftus' work doesn't even offset phone bills, he says.
   ``God, I think often about what it would be like if I just
walked out of that vault,'' says the 38-year-old Loftus. ``My
family would be healthy. I wouldn't be constantly on the edge of
bankruptcy.
   ``But I think if I would have done that, I would have been
ashamed for the rest of my life.''
   Loftus, the crusader, was once a comfortable insider with a
steppingstone resume.
   Like many Irish-Catholic boys, he went from Boston Latin School
to Jesuit-run Boston College, where he took political science
classes with other aspiring attorneys and public servants. After
graduating from Suffolk Law School in Boston in 1977, he accepted
an honor's placement in the Justice Department.
   Loftus was moving up the Justice Department ranks when he
noticed a posting in 1979 seeking applicants for the Office of
Special Investigations, created to find and deport war criminals.
   ``I joined OSI for purely selfish reasons,'' Loftus says. ``I
thought being a Nazi prosecutor would be good for my career _ and I
might even get a free trip to Germany out of it. But it was my
honest feeling that it was a waste of the government's money to
reopen cases against 60-year-old men for crimes committed 40 years
ago. I thought we had more important targets.
   ``I knew nothing about the Holocaust, like most Americans. There
were six sentences about the Holocaust and war crimes in all my
public education.''
   Loftus' education began with his first cases. He was assigned
OSI files connected to Byelorussia, or White Russia, a section of
the Soviet Union occupied by the Nazis from 1941 to 1944 when
nearly all Jewish natives were exterminated by local Nazi
collaborators.
   While researching the cases, Loftus spent hours studying old
files in the vaults in Suitland, Md., tracking the subjects from
White Russia to the United States. Many of the paths, he learned,
passed through shadowy anti-Communist groups established in Allied
nations to coordinate espionage against Joseph Stalin and the
rising Soviet regime.

   Loftus estimates nearly 10,000 Nazi officers and sympathizers
were brought into the United States through intelligence networks
using the Displaced Person's Act at the height of McCarthyism. Many
were given citizenship and have lived openly without recrimination.
Nearly 6,000 survive, he estimates.
   In South River, N.J., for example, Loftus and three other OSI
officials in 1980 checked gravestones near a monument bearing the
symbol of the Belarus SS outfit in White Russia. Ironically, Loftus
has become close friends with one of the few surviving Byelorussian
Jews, who also lives in New Jersey.
   ``Here is someone living in the shadow of the people who
murdered his family. ... We're not talking about somebody serving
as a clerk for the Nazis or someone who swept out the mess hall or
some poor kid drafted into the Nazi army; we're talking about
politicians who climbed to power over the bodies of children.''
   Loftus says the benefit of bringing in the Nazis was marginal,
and perhaps even damaging to national security. Few of those
sheltered by the intelligence community had actual links to
underground networks in Europe. In fact, some were Soviet
counter-agents, he says.
   Harold ``Kim'' Philby, who coordinated many Nazi emigrations as
leader of the Anti-Bolshevik Bloc of Nations, defected to the
Soviet Union in 1963 as one of the highest-placed moles in Western
intelligence. Philby, 76, died in May in the Soviet Union.
   By late 1980, Loftus' work was about to be tested. He was named
principal prosecutor of Stanislaw Stankievich, a high-ranking Nazi
collaborator in the White Russian city of Borissow, who was the
first to face deportation and loss of citizenship on OSI charges.
   Stankievich died in November 1980 in New York City, only weeks
before his hearing was scheduled to begin.
   A frustrated Loftus used the court file to probe further into
the Nazi-recruiting networks that brought Stankievich into the
United States. His research began to irritate OSI officials, who
wanted to focus on information directly linked to deportation
cases, Loftus says.
   ``I was told to stay out of the vaults,'' he said. ``I knew then
I would have to pursue this on my own.''
   In 1981, Loftus took down the sign he hung in his Justice
Department office: ``Wahrheit Macht Frei,'' ``Truth Shall Make You
Free,'' taken from the phrase ``Work Shall Make You Free'' that was
placed in some Nazi concentration camps.
   Since the Stankievich case, OSI has filed charges against about
60 alleged Nazis and deported about a dozen, including Karl Linnas,
who died in July 1987 in Leningrad after being convicted of war
crimes by a Soviet Court, and John Demjanjuk, who is appealing his
death sentence in Israel.
   ``People see the Holocaust as a Jewish issue,'' Loftus says.
``They don't see the larger covert abuse issue. ... I'm not a Nazi
hunter now. I'm not a Simon Wiesenthal. I'm hunting those Western
bureaucrats that recruited them, that handful of the '40s and '50s
who made Nuremberg meaningless. They created a statute of
limitations for genocide.''
   Over recent years his reports have included word from South
American sources that Nazi Dr. Josef Mengele, accused of
concentration camp atrocities, was keeping on the move in South
America; that some people in the Vatican had helped Nazis flee
after the war, and that several dozen Nazis who had worked for
Allied intelligence had been permitted to settle in Australia.
   Loftus recently wrote an article contending that the United
States and the Soviet Union stockpiled a deadly Nazi nerve gas,
Sarin, during the Cold War, and are only now considering its
destruction.
   He is lobbying for a House resolution calling for full
disclosure of postwar intelligence operations. He is also finishing
work on a book about an Irish Republican Army gun-smuggling
operation uncovered in Boston in 1984 and is researching documents
from Canada and the United Kingdom on Nazi spy networks.
   ``I think I've learned in the last six years there are three
great evils in this world: communism, fascism and indifference,''
he says.

   Julius Lester has written 19 books, many for
children. His early works include a paean hymn to black power. His
latest book, ``Lovesong,'' caused an academic uproar and his exile
from the Afro-American studies department at the University of
Massachusetts.

   Julius Lester wrote the book on black
power in 1968 with a title he meant to be funny: ``Look Out,
Whitey! Black Power's Gon' Get Your Mama!''
   The title, however, was taken seriously by at least one
newspaper, which headlined the story: ``White Mamas in Danger, Says
Black Militant.''
   That same year Lester was branded an anti-Semite for having a
teacher read a student's poem on his radio show, beginning: ``Hey,
Jew boy, with that yarmulke on your head@You pale-faced Jew boy _ I
wish you were dead.''
   Twenty years later, the maverick Lester is again provoking
controversy, much of it related to his conversion to Judaism.
   ``There's a feeling among some that by becoming a Jew I am now
to be considered a traitor to black people,'' said Lester, 49.
``I've had black people say to me that they don't consider me to be
black, which is news to me, since I look in the mirror and very
clearly I'm black.''
   The man who was once, in his own words, ``anathema to Jews'' now
exchanges his cowboy hat on Saturdays for a skullcap and prayer
shawl and leads a conservative synagogue in song.
   ``There's a kind of intellectual climate in black America today
that really demands a conformity of thought,'' he says. ``If you
are critical of certain things, Jesse Jackson for example, then
people really treat you like a pariah.''
   Ironically, his book about his conversion, ``Lovesong,'' has
made him anathema to another group, the Afro-American studies
department at the University of Massachusetts, where he has taught
for 17 years.
   In the book, published in February, Lester accused writer James
Baldwin of making anti-Semitic remarks in a 1984 lecture. But
Lester refused to debate the matter with members of the
Afro-American studies department who said he was misinformed about
the speech.
   Colleagues saw the charge as pernicious and called Lester, in a
preface to a transcript of Baldwin's speech that they sent him, an
``anti-Negro Negro ... seeking compulsively to slay the
birth-people enemy who exist in his malicious and unforgiving
imagination.''
   ``He will blow in any wind that comes,'' says Michael Thelwell,
who recruited Lester into the department in 1971. Thelwell was
among 15 department members who signed a letter suggesting Lester
would be ``infinitely more comfortable'' elsewhere.
   At the center of the storm is a lanky, long-faced man who loves
playing pool, baking loaves of hallah for Sabbath dinners and
collecting stamps with the youngest of his four children, David, 9.
   ``I guess I just don't care that much about how I appear to
others,'' he says, sitting cross-legged by a field where David
plays ball. ``What's important to me is, whom does God see when God
looks at me?''
   The writings that land Lester in such hot water are only a
sideline to his teaching, he says. His classes are always
over-booked and he is the only faculty member to have earned the
university's top three teaching awards.
   He also is studying to be a cantor and writes children's books,
which make up more than half of the 19 books he has written so far.
His latest project is the fourth volume of the retelling of Joel
Chandler Harris's ``The Tales of Uncle Remus'' in a modern dialect.
   ``A lot of people just know me for children's books,'' he says,
chuckling.
   Lester was born in 1939 to a Methodist minister who was a pillar
of black parishes in Tennessee and Kansas and who would race away
from a gas station rather than accept the services of a white man
who called him ``boy.''
   Lester's great-grandfather was a Jewish immigrant from Germany
who married an ex-slave in the late 1800s and built a house that
stood apart from both the white and black neighborhoods of Pine
Bluff, Ark.
   In his will, his great-grandfather pledged his love to his wife
and wrote that he considered her ``my true and honest wife''
despite the anti-miscegenation laws of the time.
   Lester grew up a model minister's son, learning the Bible better
than some of his teachers.
   As a child, he was fascinated with ``Kol Nidre,'' a Hebrew
melody played on the eve of Yom Kippur, and with Shakespeare's
Shylock in ``The Merchant of Venice.'' He later wrote that he
identified with Shylock in ways he could not with black leaders.
   Lester graduated from Fisk University in 1960 and headed for New
York. Even then, the lure of Judaism was strong. Although Lester,
who has been married twice to whites, made a living as a folk
singer, the black spirituals he played failed to move him as
powerfully as Jewish songs did.

   He eventually joined the increasingly militant Student
Non-violent Coordinating Committee and in 1968 drew attention
through publication of ``Look Out, Whitey,'' an exposition of the
black power principles. Lester now says he's embarrassed by the
book.
   ``In my soul I had very serious questions about black power. I
left all of that out because I felt it had to speak for the
movement. The book is honest as far as it goes, but is a betrayal
of my soul,'' he says.
   ``My problems with black power had to do with wondering whether
it would be different from white power. ... It seemed to me we were
in danger of becoming more like white people while we were thinking
we were being different.''
   On a talk show he led for several years on WBAI-FM in New York,
he broadcast an anti-Semitic poem, he said, to focus on strong
feelings aroused in some blacks by a struggle with Jews over the
control of schools in Brooklyn.
   The reading unleashed even stronger feelings. It brought death
threats, demonstrations and calls from the Jewish Defense League
for his ouster from the station.
   So it was with shock that Lester's friends and foes read in
1979, 11 years later, his article beginning: ``And so, Jews are
being used as scapegoats again.''
   The article criticized black leaders who accused Jews of
pressuring Andrew Young into resigning as U.S. ambassador to the
United Nations after he met secretly with the Palestine Liberation
Organization's representative to the United Nations, against U.S.
policy.
   Those leaders, Lester wrote, ``merely show that blacks, too, can
be Germans.''
   Lester, who by then had been teaching at the University of
Massachusetts for nine years, nearly ended up in a fistfight with a
professor over the article. He stopped attending department
meetings.
   The Young episode was followed in 1985 by an article criticizing
Jesse Jackson for his ``race for power'' and whites for overlooking
his ``Hymietown'' gaffe.
   ``An unfortunate legacy of the '60s has been an almost total,
moral abdication on the part of whites where anything black is
concerned,'' he wrote.
   The final straw for his departmental colleagues came in
``Lovesong,'' with Lester's account of Baldwin and the Jews. Lester
wrote that Baldwin somehow held Jews responsible for the outcry
over the ``Hymietown'' remark. Later he conceded that might have
been a misinterpretation.
   He had also written that he knew that Baldwin was not an
anti-Semite, ``but his remarks in class were anti-Semitic and he
does not realize it.''
   A month after the book's publication, a department meeting was
called to talk about the charge. Soon the letter suggesting
Lester's transfer was on its way to the dean of humanities.
   ``We have nothing against his Judaism,'' department Chairman
Chester Davis told the Amherst Bulletin. ``But when one develops a
vicious attitude toward blacks and black organizations, Jackson,
Baldwin and civil rights, there is some question as to the
appropriateness'' of remaining.
   Chancellor Joseph Duffey termed the meeting ``an inquisition''
and said it raised questions about Lester's academic freedom.
Professor Thelwell said the book raised questions about his
professional standards.
   ``There is no issue of academic freedom,'' Thelwell said in a
prepared statement. ``Elements of the media and the academy created
one in order to vent an ugly racist bias: `See, we've always known
that these black academics are culturally and intellectually
deficient, crude nationalist ideologues with no tolerance for or
understanding of the nuances of civilized discourse and the
protocols of free inquiry. Without the lowered intellectual
standards caused by affirmative action, they would not even be in a
university.'''
   A faculty committee that investigated found no evidence Lester's
academic freedom had been violated by his transfer to the Judaic
studies department, which both parties agreed to.
   The appointment is for one year. Chairman Shmuel Bolozky says
making Lester a permanent member of the department would be
``tantamount to putting him in a straitjacket. Lester himself, a
man not fond of artificial boundaries, would rather be free to
teach without departmental confinement.

   As a youngster, she wanted to be Jane Goodall
when she grew up. Or maybe a park ranger, zoo keeper or horse
trainer. Like her husband, she wound up as a schoolteacher, but not
for long. Genny and Lee Barhaugh figure they have the ideal job,
running a dude ranch in the wilds of Montana.

   Genny Barhaugh was a proper Massachusetts
preppie in her teen years, studying hard with hopes of going on to
Radcliffe. Today, she's an experienced wrangler and ranch cook, and
unofficial arm-wrestling champion of Great Falls.
   She feels she has the best job in the world.
   Genny and her husband, Lee, both 33 and both former
schoolteachers, manage the Pine Butte Guest Ranch, a small
non-profit dude ranch owned by The Nature Conservancy and
surrounded by wilderness _ 18,000 acres managed by the conservancy
and an additional 1,009,356 acres in the Bob Marshall Wilderness
Preserve.
   It's the largest wild expanse in the contiguous 48 states, and
the Pine Butte Swamp, technically a fen, is the largest wetland
complex along the eastern slope of the Rockies and one of the last
strongholds of the grizzly bear.
   It's also home to bobcats, mountain lions, wolverines, badgers,
foxes, coyotes and deer, virtually every mammal native to Montana,
as well as hundreds of species of birds, falcons, eagles and hawks.
   The winters are bleak as the chinooks, Indian for snow eaters,
howl outside for days on end. The winds, which are warm, melt the
snow and may bring the temperature up by 30 to 40 degrees in a
given day. Everything adapts. The pine trees are called limber pine
because they give with the wind, but all are stunted and twisted
from its constancy.
   Genny and Lee don't really get a day off from May 1 until Nov.
1. They spend their Sundays hauling guests to and from the Great
Falls Airport, a 90-minute drive. The rest of the week Genny is up
at 6 a.m. to oversee the cooking of breakfast. She doesn't get back
to her home until 8 or 8:30 p.m.
   The ranch accommodates up to 25 guests in nine rustic cabins,
each with fireplace, private bath and handmade furniture. In
season, the $595 per person per week includes airport
transportation, three family-style meals a day, with homemade
breads and fresh vegetables bought from a nearby Hutterite
community.
   Two trail rides a day and a variety of naturalist programs are
also included. For the hardy, there are treks led by a naturalist
to sites of dinosaur eggs, down into a fen, up to a beaver pond,
high on to hills, off to a swamp where birders can see up to 130
species. Each evening a naturalist gives a talk or a slide show in
the main lodge.
   or the less athletic, there is a heated swimming pool, a center
with a few fossils, and some nice easy trails to wander alone
through the aspen, cottonwood and firs.
   After Labor Day, the horses are gone and the price drops to $450
a week.
   Genny is paid $12,000 a year, her husband $16,000.
   ``We're obviously not in this for the money,'' she jokes.
   She spent last winter sending out brochures and getting the
cabins booked for the summer.
   In the winter, the chinooks, which can blow up to 70 mph,
sometimes keep her cabin-bound for up to five days.
   ``I feel the elements are making some kind of statement,'' she
says. ``I feel the winds are saying this is supposed to be a wild
place. I feel that maybe I shouldn't be here.
   ``I get depressed, but when it's over and I'm outside again, I'm
fine.''
   Genny, who was disillusioned as a teacher by the students' lack
of motivation and discipline problems, says, ``I feel like I have a
very wide mix of skills and here I'm using them to the best of my
ability.''
   As a youngster, Genny wanted to be Jane Goodall when she grew
up. Or maybe a park ranger, zoo keeper or horse trainer.
   ``It was all rather nebulous, but I somehow knew I wanted to be
involved with animals,'' she says. ``But it was a family tradition
to go to prep school.'' So the native of St. Clair, Mich., daughter
of a salt company executive, was sent to Abbot, a Massachusetts
prep school now absorbed by Andover.
   ``I really studied hard but then I realized my dream was not in
the East,'' she says.
   So she headed West and the preppie became a head wrangler, a
ranch hand who chopped and hauled wood with the men, a ranch cook,
a schoolteacher, a journalist.
   On one of her previous jobs, where she was head cook for 100
people, there was a grizzly with two cubs very close to the camp.
Genny had to walk 150 yards in the darkness to get breakfast going.
   ``There were a couple of Saint Bernards at the camp and I always
took one of them with me,'' she says. ``Not that he would have done
much good, but he made me feel better.
   ``Lee and I had great dreams of someday getting our own guest
ranch, but we didn't know where we would get that much capital.
Then we heard The Nature Conservancy was looking and it sounded
like such a dream we couldn't let it go.''
   They got the job, sold their house, and Genny moved out to the
ranch with her infant daughter, Laney. Lee, a high school teacher,
had to finish the school term.
   Laney is now an energetic 2-year-old with no qualms about
climbing aboard a horse with her mother.
   Lee, a native of Casper, Wyo., is not the equestrian his wife
is. Genny, who has owned her own horse off and on since she was in
the sixth-grade, has competed in riding competitions.
   Jenny spent one year at the University of Oregon, dropped out to
tour the West with two friends in a Volkswagen, then got two
degrees, one in zoology from the University of Montana, and one in
English from Montana State.
   Jenny laughs at the female arm-wrestling title, announced by her
boastful husband.
   ``It's really unofficial,'' she says. ``I pride myself on being
strong, but this was at a party. All the women began arm wrestling
and I won. It may also have something to do with the fact that I
was the only sober person at the party.''

   It all started out of concern for the loon. Now
a Wisconsin couple is into publishing full-time, spreading the word
about the wonders of nature. But Tom and Pat Klein insist they are
not crusaders, they're just running a business. As Tom Klein puts
it, ``Nobody wants to pay to be preached at.''

   She was a former Girl Scout who loved to
hike in northern woods. He grew up boating and fishing and became
director of an environmental education institute.
   Now, Tom and Pat Klein are trying to spread the word about the
wonders of the land from northern California to northern New
England with NorthWord Press Inc.
   The 4-year-old publishing house is tucked away in a pine-covered
area about 200 miles north of Madison amid the lakes, loons and
other wildlife that are subjects of the books the husband-and-wife
team publish.
   Tom Klein, 40, NorthWord's editor-in-chief and author of two of
the company's three dozen titles, said he doubted the couple could
do its work with the same level of credibility in a big city.
   ``I think we'd quickly lose touch with our sources and the
spiritual feel of what we're about,'' Klein says.
   Most of their books carry an ecological message and photographs
to inspire readers to help preserve the wilderness, but the Kleins
say they are not crusaders.
   ``I came into this with a lot of conservation crusading zeal,
but we were trying to start a business,'' Klein says. ``Nobody
wants to pay to be preached at, so you really have to work it into
the text.''
   The naturalists began their publishing firm with ``Loon Magic,''
a 160-page, coffee-table book by Klein filled with color pictures
of the dark-headed bird with the high-pitched, quivering call of
the wilderness.
   Klein had been director of the Sigurd Olson Environmental
Institute at Northland College in Ashland and was a founder of
Wisconsin Project Loon Watch, an effort begun in 1978 to monitor
the loon population and educate lake-area landowners about the
birds.
   He wrote the book after hundreds of people at the scores of
lectures he gave to Wisconsin groups asked him where they could get
more information about the bird.
   Research journals included a few paragraphs on the diving birds
but most of the loon knowledge was still in the heads of
researchers who hadn't put it on paper, Klein says. So, he decided
to write a book a layman could understand, using information
gleaned from experts and people such as an Alaskan bush pilot who
had spent years counting loons on his own.
   ``We were sure we had a best seller,'' says Mrs. Klein, 41, who
left her job as a sales coordinator for a picture framing company
to launch the publishing firm originally known as Paper Birch Press
in 1984.
   The $40 book has become the flagship publication of the firm,
with more than 60,000 copies sold since June 1985.
   With the purchase of two smaller Madison publishers, the
NorthWord name and additional titles, the company grew. It had $1.5
million in sales last year, Klein says.
   Originally, the couple intended to publish one book and go back
to other jobs, but they realized they did not want to waste what
they had learned in publishing the first book, Mrs. Klein says.
   ``What I've been astounded by is the opportunity to do the same
kind of education work I was doing in a non-profit organization in
a for-profit company,'' Klein says. He says the company made a
``very modest'' profit last year.
   To sell their first book, the couple sent flyers to people on
mailing lists of conservation and nature groups. They marched
through shopping malls, trying to persuade individual bookstore
managers to stock the book or ask their corporate buyers to order
it.
   Now, NorthWord is just big enough to deal directly with the
large bookstore chains such as B. Dalton and Waldenbooks, Klein
says. About 30 independent commission sales representatives also
market NorthWord books to independent bookstores and several
mail-order catalogs carry the books.
   But the company still does about 3 percent of its sales to
people responding to direct mailings or magazine advertisements,
Klein says.
   NorthWord will spend about $100,000 in advertising and
promotions this fall, most of it for full-page color advertisements
in magazines published by groups such as the Audubon Society,
Sierra Club and Wilderness Society, he says.
   In September, the company is introducing several new titles,
including a 160-page book on the white wolf by Jim Brandenburg who
spent four months photographing an arctic wolf pack on Ellesmere
Island. About half of the 60,000 copies in the first printing had
been sold a month before its release, Klein says.
   Pages from another new release, Klein's chronicle of the Border
Country in the Quetico-Superior Wilderness between the United
States and Canada, decorate the walls of NorthWord's offices in
Minocqua.
   Klein hoped the book would give people who have enjoyed the area
a deeper appreciation for its history and fragility.
   The business has kept Klein away from the extended canoe trips
he once enjoyed and has prevented Mrs. Klein from hiking and
jogging as much as she would like.
   But Klein, who sits on the board of the Wisconsin chapter of the
Nature Conservancy, said he enjoys ``just wallowing in the
content'' of the books they publish.
   ``I think it's the perfect situation. His advocation is also his
vocation. It's something we all would ideally love to do,'' says
Mark Peterson, a friend of the Kleins who succeeded Tom as
institute director in late 1985.
   The Kleins moved their business from Ashland, where it began in
their home, to this north-central Wisconsin town of about 3,500
last spring.
   Mrs. Klein, a Milwaukee native who spent summers camping in
northern Wisconsin, said the couple wanted to live on the inland
lakes where they could hear the call of the loon.
   They live about 15 miles from the office, at a home on Lake
Flambeau, where they spend their weekends and evenings
sail-boarding and fishing.
   ``We watch eagles, ospreys and loons seven days a week from our
porch,'' says Klein, a Sun Prairie native who grew up in a family
that sold boats and outdoor equipment.
   Klein met his wife after the two both applied for the same job
for a non-profit health group, a job Tom held for a while before
marrying Pat in 1974 and heading north.

   You might get the idea that Margaret
Whitton's new series for ABC, ``A Fine Romance,'' is a travelogue
with gags.
   Whitton and Anthony Andrews star in this lighthearted adventure
as a battling divorced couple who find themselves paired up as
hosts of a television travel show.
   The one-hour show is filmed on location in Europe _ London one
week, then off to Paris, Rome, Greece and other romantic places.
It's all picturesque background for Whitton and Andrews to get into
mischief and swap roundhouse punches and makeup kisses.
   ``We filmed the pilot in Italy, in Rome and Florence and Pisa,''
Whitton says. ``We'll be filming all over the continent.''
   ``A Fine Romance'' will be one of the last ABC fall series to
reach the home screen. Like all the series, it was delayed by the
writers' strike, and its European locale adds further delays.
   In addition to the TV series, Whitton, a rabid New York Yankees
fan, went to Milwaukee for ``Major League,'' a theatrical film
about baseball with Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger and Corbin Bernsen
of ``L.A. Law.''
   ``I have box seats behind the batting cage for the Yankee
games,'' she says.
   Whitton grew up in Philadelphia, where she fell in love with
reading at an early age.
   ``I still love to turn off the phone and curl up with a good
book,'' she says. ``I'm not really sure why I turned to acting,
even now. I think it's a borrowed imbalance. I can't focus on it.
One of my memories as a kid was that I wanted to be a jockey. I
wanted to be an Ikette with Tina Turner. I wanted to be a
journalist at one point. A writer. I was always writing stories as
a kid.
   ``I think acting was just a way for me to realize all the
fantasies in my head. I think of actors essentially as greedy
people who want to live a lot of lives. Maybe it's some memory.''
   She broke into acting on the New York stage, both off and on
Broadway. Between roles, she worked as a dog walker. Her first
television appearances were on the soap operas, ``The Doctors'' and
``One Life to Live.''
   ``I still consider myself a New York actress,'' she says. ``You
can mess it up at the evening show. You can try anything at the
matinee. But with film, once it's in the can you can't change it.
The soaps subsidized my stage work.''
   Her first prime-time series was ``Hometown,'' which CBS aired in
the 1985-86 season. It was a sort of ``thirtysomething'' before its
time. The pilot script by Julie and Dinah Kirgo had been around for
a while, but it wasn't until ``The Big Chill'' became a hit movie
that CBS agreed to put it on the air.
   In ``The Best of Times,'' she worked with Robin Williams and
Kurt Russell. She played the hooker who parked her trailer on the
county line and took credit cards. ``Robin was the only person I've
ever worked with who broke me up,'' she says. ``I'd blow a take.
He's got a hot line to God's funny bone.''
   She was also in ``9{ Weeks,'' ``National Lampoon Goes to the
Movies'' and ``Love Child.'' She was Michael J. Fox's amorous aunt
in ``The Secret of My Success.'' ``I seduced him endlessly,'' she
says.
   She describes Louise, her role in ``A Fine Romance,'' as a woman
``who doesn't have all her sensors on.''
   ``She's very beguiling, but in a manipulative way,'' she says.
``She flies by the seat of her pants and ends up in these
situations. Louise is a person to whom things happen. You can go in
all directions with her.
   ``The romance with Anthony will be prickly, just like in real
life. He can't resist her. He thinks he wants the staid, stolid
English life, but he's attracted to Louise against his will and
better judgment. The humor is so off-the-wall I'm surprised ABC
went for it.''
   The pilot for ``A Fine Romance'' has already been televised on
London Weekend Television. There, it's called ``A Ticket to Ride,''
which is the name of the travel show in the series in which Whitton
and Andrews are the hosts.

   Every time someone he knew died of AIDS,
playwright Larry Kramer would write the name on a small piece of
paper and throw it into a large box. When he finally counted the
slips, he discovered he had more than 500.
   ``That's what fuels me,'' he says. ``All that memory and all
that sadness and all that anger. I really don't know why I'm
alive.''
   Eight years into the AIDS epidemic, Kramer is fighting on the
front lines, on the street and in the theater.
   ``Looking around at the people who are alive, we all react in
either one way or the other,'' he says. ``One is denial. People
just go on with their lives and try not to think about it. Or there
are people who turn into walking furies like me.''
   On the street, Kramer co-founded the Gay Men's Health Crisis and
later formed ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power). ``We protest
everywhere,'' he says, proudly pointing to a photograph of his
arrest in front of the White House.
   The passion carries into the plays he writes. ``The Normal
Heart,'' produced by the New York Shakespeare Festival in 1985, was
one of the first AIDS plays to reach a mainstream theater audience.
The play, which starred Brad Davis as a hotheaded gay activist not
unlike Kramer, was a defiant cry, a shout against bureaucratic and
personal paralysis in the face of the devastating disease.
   Now he has written another play, ``Just Say No,'' which he says
is not an AIDS play, although it deals peripherally with the
disease. Kramer calls his new play ``farcical.'' It's meant to make
audiences laugh.
   ``While a farce, `Just Say No' is a very angry play,'' Kramer
says. ``It's really another attempt to do what I did in `The Normal
Heart,' which is to bring shocking conditions to the attention of
the public.''
   The setting for ``Just Say No,'' on view at off-Broadway's tiny
WPA Theater, is Georgetown, the capital of a mythical country
called New Columbia where a Mrs. Potentate, a more than just first
lady, reigns supreme. Other characters include her ballet dancer
son as well as the mayor of Appleberg, the largest northeastern
city in New Columbia. Theatergoers are free to draw the obvious
connections.
   ``It's all been checked by lawyers,'' the playwright says with a
sigh. ``So many times.''
   Kramer sits in his book-filled Greenwich Village apartment. His
dog Molly _ ``my muse,'' he calls her _ sits at his feet as he
talks about ``Just Say No.''
   ``It's political theater,'' the author says. ``I guess it goes
back to what they did in Berlin in the 1920s. It deals with
contemporary public issues. I don't know if people 10 or 15 years
from now will know most of the references. It's very much of the
moment. I love dealing with the immediacy of today.''
   Before working in the theater, Kramer spent much of his career
in the movie industry as an executive at Columbia Pictures and
United Artists. He produced and adapted D.H. Lawrence's ``Women in
Love'' for the screen and was nominated for an Academy Award.
   Has he always been an iconoclast?
   ``I don't know,'' he says. ``I think that's the reputation I
have now because of `The Normal Heart' and all my AIDS activities.
I write a lot of AIDS blasts.
   ``What I'm interested in is `gossip as life,' exposing hypocrisy
and sham and trying to tell the world the things the world doesn't
know or want to know.''
   ``The Normal Heart'' was turned down by every major play agent
in New York, all the networks and more than a half-dozen producers
until Joseph Papp decided to put it on at the Shakespeare Festival.
   ``Just Say No'' was no easier to bring to the stage, says
Kramer. ``It got a faster reading everywhere, but the play scared
everybody just as much as `The Normal Heart' did. People say it is
outrageous in every sense of the term. They either love it or hate
it.''
   ``Just Say No'' was to have been produced by the Shakespeare
Festival as a commercial offering, but legal problems because of
the festival's non-profit status forced it to bow out. However,
Kyle Renick, artistic director of the WPA, had an opening on his
fall schedule.
   The play was written about 18 months ago, but Kramer got caught
up in his AIDS activism and put it aside. He says it should have
been done earlier and wants it on before the presidential elections.
   Kramer says his anger has made him unbelievably productive. He
has written another play, a serious, companion piece to ``The
Normal Heart,'' as well as the screenplay for ``The Normal Heart.''
He also has a book coming out in February called ``Reports from the
holocaust: The Making of an AIDS Activist.''
   It's holocaust with a small `h,' Kramer says, and the book
contains about 400 pages of writing he has done on AIDS for various
publications as well as about 100 new pages explaining why he
believes the AIDS epidemic can be called a holocaust.
   ``You can't be a gay man in New York without really being
swamped by AIDS,'' the 53-year-old Kramer says. ``I've never seen
such a major problem being handled by second-rate people and that's
across the board, from Mr. Reagan obviously, Mr. Koch obviously,
but all of the people in all of the agencies from Health and Human
Services to FDA to NIH to CDC.''
   Does Kramer want to write about anything else?
   ``There is absolutely nothing else that's of any interest to
me,'' he says. ``I feel a responsibility to write about AIDS so
that there is a record of it or at least my version of the record
of it.''

<DATELINE>PALERMO, Sicily (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Swimming children giggle, a breeze stirs
the eucalyptus, and Paolo Borsellino tries to forget the murder and
corruption that are the focus of his daily work.
   But a gloom that has enveloped Italy's war against the Mafia
follows the graying magistrate like a cloud, even as he relaxes
outside his beachfront vacation home.
   ``A certain weariness has overcome Palermo,'' he says, staring
broodingly at the purple Sicilian hills. ``Today the commitment to
fight the Mafia isn't as strong as before.''
   Government and police officials in the Sicilian capital express
similar feelings. They speak of blocked investigations, of
political indifference, of threats to those who take on the mob.
   The problem has grown so serious that Italy's president,
Francesco Cossiga, recently demanded an inquiry into investigations
in Palermo, headquarters of the Mafia and its multibillion-dollar
drug trade.
   Shortly thereafter, Giovanni Falcone, Italy's top Mafia
investigator, submitted his resignation, saying working conditions
were impossible.
   While some blame weariness for the investigative problems,
others see the corrupting hand of the Mafia.
   ``Today, in these months, there is a new effort by the dark
force to reappropriate the city,'' declares the Rev. Ennio
Pintacuda, a Jesuit priest who advises the Palermo government.
   The case has alarmed the national government, which has
appointed a new Mafia commissioner. It also has raised concern at
the U.S. Justice Department, which conducts joint investigations of
the Mafia with Italian officials.
   ``Without Falcone, our efforts are really going to be
hampered,'' says one Justice Department official, speaking only on
condition of anonymity.
   At the center of the crisis are a group of investigating
magistrates, who in the Italian legal system draw up indictments,
using police and judicial methods. They often work alone.
   Falcone, Borsellino and his colleagues instead formed a pool so
that the Mafia could not, as in the past, kill off a case by
killing off an investigator.
   In the five years since, the magistrates' intensive teamwork has
paid off with evidence not only about the Mafia's local operation,
but its business in Europe and the United States as well.
   It culminated in 338 convictions this past December in the
``maxi-trial'' of Mafia members accused of murder, robbery and drug
trafficking to the U.S. East Coast.
   It also contributed to the 18 convictions in the ``Pizza
Connection'' trial of heroin suppliers who used American pizza
parlors as fronts.
   But since January, when Italy's Superior Council of Magistrates
chose 68-year-old Judge Antonino Meli to head the ``anti-Mafia
pool,'' a split has developed in the unit. The Council passed over
the 49-year-old Falcone, ruling he was too young.
   ``A few months after Meli took over, the system was changed
completely,'' says Borsellino, who left the team last year.
   The new director began sending Mafia cases to judges outside the
pool, and assigning non-Mafia cases to pool members, he says.
   ``We are returning to the system of the '60s, in which each
judge did his job and no one knew what anyone else was doing _ and
no one had a global view of the Mafia,'' asserts Borsellino.
   He complained publicly in July and the Italian president ordered
an investigation. A week later, Falcone resigned and his pool
colleagues threatened to follow.
   ``We feel we are in danger of losing a way of coordination in
the fight against the Mafia that brought optimal results,'' says
pool member Gioacchino Natoli.
   Meli's office said he would not comment on the accusations. In
his few public remarks, he has said he spread cases among different
judges to increase the level of experience.
   The other magistrates say Meli, with little experience in Mafia
investigations, does not realize the importance of specialization.
   Other people insist the problem is political influence.
   ``It could be that instead of direct pressure, it's an
environment created by that part of the city that says the Mafia is
not a danger,'' says Pintacuda. ``In that group are also
politicians.''
   On Sept. 14, the Superior Council of Magistrates concluded that
no one had tried to remove the pool from Mafia cases. But it also
endorsed the pool's working methods.
   Even if the magistrates remain, the split in the judiciary has
hurt.
   Tommaso Buscetta, a key Mafia informer, said he would not make
further disclosures while the judges were divided. Important
investigations have languished, according to U.S. officials.
   In Natoli's office, next to a window with double rows of
bulletproof glass, hang plaques from the FBI, the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration and the New York City Police Department.
   ``When all the institutions have worked together, we have had
splendid results,'' says the 41-year-old Natoli.
   The judges' difficulties, he adds, have been exacerbated by a
decline in support from such institutions as the police and
parliament in Rome.
   It was parliament that provided the key to many past successes
against the Mafia. In 1982, it established a new crime, that of
Mafia association, and allowed inspection of suspects' bank records.
   But there has been no movement on judges' requests for a witness
protection program or a provision to reduce informers' sentences.
   ``There have been moments in which it has appeared the state
would resolve the problem,'' Natoli says, fingering his gold-framed
glasses. ``Later it is always set aside.''
   More problematic, he adds, has been the police situation. The
detective unit that formerly handled Mafia investigations has been
destroyed by two Mafia assassinations and the arrests of several
officers in the death of one of the suspected assassins.
   One of the last members of the unit, Francesco Accordino, was
recently transferred after receiving death threats reportedly
traced to a police telephone.
   The threats to Italy's war on organized crime have come just as
the ``anti-Mafia pool'' was beginning to focus on politicians'
links to the Mafia. Some say the timing is no coincidence.
   ``When judges limit themselves to trying (Mafia chief Michele)
Greco, fine,'' says Carmine Mancuso, a police inspector who also
heads a citizen's group to rally popular support against the Mafia.
``The problem begins when Falcone and the others begin to talk
about political investigations.''
   The wail of sirens has increased this summer in Palermo.
Magistrates and government officials speed past in police
motorcades. Authorities recently increased security for those
active in the war on the Mafia, even assigning bodyguards to two
priests.
   At Borsellino's house a bodyguard in sunglasses and a pink,
open-necked shirt relaxes on a lounge chair, his large black pistol
hidden in a folded newspaper.
   ``Society has paid a terribly high price for the war on the
Mafia,'' Borsellino says. ``This has created a climate of
weariness.''
   Mayor Leoluca Orlando of Palermo says the public hasn't lost
heart. And he notes the government has responded to the crisis by
naming a prominent anti-terrorism investigator, Domenico Sica, as
the Mafia commissioner and increasing his investigative powers.
   ``The state made a strong effort during the maxi-trial,''
Orlando says. ``The message was clear. We must recover that clarity
to move forward.''

<HEAD>Agatha Christie Remembered _ in Iraq</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a little mud-brick room on the ruins of
old Nimrud, north of Baghdad, an ordinary-looking Engishwoman
retired each day from the fierce Assyrian sun to plot murder.
   Locals on the archaeological dig knew the woman as Mrs.
Mallowan, a photographer. But the books she wrote in the crude
little room bore another name.
   Agatha Christie.
   As her archaelogist husband, Sir Max Mallowan, helped chart the
dawn of history in the desert hills, Miss Christie sat among
Mesopotamian relics and conjured cases for the fictional detectives
of her mystery novels.
   Her years after World War II at Nimrud, one of the great cities
of the Assyrian empire in 1400-600 B.C., capped decades of Middle
Eastern travel and archaeological work that left traces scattered
throughout her 77 books.
   Miss Christie first arrived in the Middle East in 1907, aged 17,
for her debutante season in Cairo, Egypt.
   ``We spent three months there and I went to five dances every
week,'' she recalled in an autobiography in 1965.
   She later set at least two novels in Egypt: ``Death on The
Nile'' and ``Death Comes As the End,'' a tale of love and murder in
the Thebes of 2000 B.C.
   A deeper relationship with the area began in the 1930s when she
took the Orient Express across Europe to Turkey and continued on by
train and car across the wild Syrian desert to Baghdad.
   There she met Mallowan. They spent most of the next 20 years
bouncing between Britain and archaeological digs in Iraq and Syria.
   ``She was very unprepossessing to look at,'' said the Iraqi
writer and critic Jabra Ibrahim Jabra, who first met her in 1949.
   ``She was a very charming woman to talk to, very attentive ...
with a dry sense of humor. You wouldn't know she was the great
Agatha Christie.''
   Jabra said she lived with Mallowan in the former home of King
Ali on the bank of the Tigris River. The house and its surroundings
made a cameo appearance in her 1951 spy novel, ``They Came to
Baghdad'':
   ``There was the persistent honking of motor horns, the cries of
vendors of various wares. There were hot disputes between small
groups of people who seemed ready to murder each other but were
really fast friends.''
   All of that seems true today, although the donkeys, horses and
mud-brick homes she described in the book are rapidly giving way to
Brazilian-made Volkswagens and concrete high-rises.
   The dusty, bouncing road to Babylon she recounts in that novel
is now a smooth highway.
   And the ``meaningless pile of ruined mud and burnt brick'' she
found there has been resurrected into a freshly whitewashed
reconstruction of King Nebuchadnezzar's 6th century B.C. capital.
   Baghdad's Rashid Street is still a major downtown thoroughfare,
as it was when Miss Christie first visited, although some of its
fancier buildings have decayed.
   The Tigris Palace Hotel where Miss Christie stayed still stands,
although she would never recognize the remodeled and cut-rate Ibn
Haitham as the graceful hotel that figured in her 1935 book,
``Murder in Mesopotamia.''
   British and American expatriates in Baghdad still gather weekly
in a play-reading circle that claims Miss Christie as an early
member.
   Archaeologists at the British Expedition office in Baghdad say
some of their furnishings are rumored to have once graced her
living room.
   Her mud-brick workroom still stands at Nimrud, although it's now
used as a storage room.
   The creator of the prim and proper Miss Marple has even had the
honor of a banned book. Her remembrances of life on the digs,
``Come, Tell Me How You Live,'' was blocked by Iraqi censors
because it was considered to be ``derogatory.''
   Miss Christie is still remembered at the charming but decrepit
Baron's Hotel in Aleppo, Syria, where she reportedly worked on
several books.
   But the owners of the Orient Palace Hotel in Damascus, the
Syrian capital, where she stayed on her first visit to the region,
did not recall her.
   The once-elegant hotel still has the marble floors and dim
lights she described. But paint peels from the hallway walls and
portraits of Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini peer sternly out
from the front windows.
   The Orient Palace now accommodates the families of Iranians
killed in the war with Iraq who are flown to Damascus on state-paid
vacations.
   The Nabatean ruins at Petra in Jordan, backdrop for
``Appointment With Death,'' are no longer, as Miss Christie wrote,
``a full day's motor run across the desert'' from Amman, the
kingdom's capital.
   But Petra itself _ ``as real as _ as raw beef,'' she described
it _ remains the same.
   Writer-critic Jabra said most of Miss Christie's books are about
``the English in a foreign country'' and had little to do with the
locals.
   ``Her geographical descriptions are quite good, but her contact
with Iraqis was limited,'' he said.
   But he added she was ``very well-liked by Iraqis who knew her.''
She returned that affection in her autobiography.
   ``How much I have loved that part of the world,'' she wrote. ``I
love it still and I always shall.''

   In case you were crying your eyes out because
the networks are losing their audience to cable and videocassettes,
the new fall schedule will make you dry up real fast.
   Playing it safe seems to be the name of the game for the
networks in the 1988-89 television season.
   NBC will win the season, its fourth in a row, with help from the
Summer Olympics, followed in October by the World Series. So no
wonder its schedule is filled with spinoffs, clones and ripoffs.
But you can't say much more for ABC and CBS.
   ABC, long ago committed to ``War and Remembrance,'' the last of
the big-time miniseries and sequel to ``The Winds of War,'' will
start doling out the 30-hour monster with an 18-hour dose in
November.
   ``War and Remembrance'' wasn't supposed to be on until February.
Its early scheduling is one remnant of the four-month Writers Guild
strike that will put an asterisk next to the 1988-89 television
season. The traditional fall preview that normally comes in late
September has been strewn from early October until late December.
   Other vestiges of the strike are NBC's ``Unsolved Mysteries,'' a
cheap ``infotainment'' series, and ABC's ``Incredible Sunday,'' a
reincarnation of ``That's Incredible!'' Both shows are considered
``informational'' and weren't affected by the writers strike, so
they could go into production when the networks weren't sure how
long the strike would last.
   Also in response to the strike delay, ABC slapped together a new
``Mission: Impossible'' to fill in until ``A Fine Romance'' comes
on mid-season, while a re-created ``Police Story'' will fill for
the new ``Saturday Mystery Movie,'' also delayed until mid-season.
   Some new shows were written well before the writers strike, so
they have no excuse.
   Since viewers were too lazy last season to tune out the witless
``A Different World'' spinoff that NBC slotted right after ``The
Cosby Show,'' NBC is trying that gambit again with ``Empty Nest,''
which takes place in the two ``Golden Girls'' neighborhoods: Miami
and Saturday nights. ``Baby Boom'' is a spinoff of the movie of the
same name.
   NBC's only immediate winner is ``Dear John,'' which reunites
likable ``Taxi'' star Judd Hirsch and ``Taxi'' creator Ed.
Weinberger. NBC has given it a cushy Thursday night timeslot,
moving the degenerated ``Night Court'' to Wednesday.
   ``Tattinger's'' is an offbeat comedy-drama about a
handsome-but-tough restaurateur and his socialite ex-wife. It comes
from the makers of ``St. Elsewhere,'' and the characters are
engaging, though the show needs to find its voice.
   ABC seems to have the lead in development, after putting on the
fine ``thirtysomething'' last season and adding ``The Wonder
Years'' in the spring. The two shows won Emmys in their categories.
ABC also added ``China Beach,'' a classy drama about women in the
Vietnam war.
   This year, ABC starts the season with one sure winner,
``Roseanne,'' a sitcom with something to say, from the producers of
NBC's biggest hit ever, ``The Cosby Show.''
   ABC's ``Knightwatch'' is murky film noir set around a Guardian
Angels-type law enforcement group. ABC's ``Murphy's Law'' casts
George Segal as a seedy insurance investigator in a plodding crime
drama.
   ABC is guarding its second-place finish of last season by
playing it safe, bringing back Peter Falk as ``Columbo'' in the
``Saturday Mystery Movie'' mid-season. The other two movies that
will rotate with ``Columbo'' are untested vehicles starring,
respectively, Burt Reynolds and Louis Gossett Jr.
   CBS, third in the Nielsens last season, seems to be trying.
``Murphy Brown,'' a sophisticated comedy starring Candice Bergen as
a TV reporter who just got off the bottle, shows promise and has a
decent time slot on Monday night. ``Almost Grown'' is an ambitious
study of a baby boomer couple over three decades.
   But CBS also fell into nostalgia by teaming Dick Van Dyke and
Mary Tyler Moore _ in separate shows on Wednesday night. Moore's
show, still untitled, is underdeveloped. The producers were so
unhappy with Van Dyke's pilot that it had to be redone. Critics
have yet to see it.
   CBS was also inspired by a popular movie and made ``Dirty
Dancing'' into a series. Its pilot, too, is being redone and hasn't
been previewed.

   Some of the new shows on the networks' fall
schedule aren't so new, but they'll do the job until late October
and November when the real fall schedule kicks in.
   Because of the four-month writers strike, the networks made
commitments to some series that were ``strike-proof'' as well as
others that weren't really all that good but looked better because
at least they were written.
   Two ABC ``place-holders'' are old series being re-shot from the
original scripts.
   ``Mission Impossible'' premieres Oct. 23 and will fill in for
``A Fine Romance,'' an ambitious international romantic comedy,
filmed in Europe, that won't get on the air until January. Peter
Graves returns in the role he created in the late '60s, but the
rest of the cast is new. One of them is Phil Morris, son of Greg
Morris, a main character on the original show. The series is being
shot in Australia.
   ABC is also reviving ``Police Story,'' which will premiere Oct.
29. The original, created by Joseph Wambaugh, ran in the 1970s and
was one of the best police dramas television has ever seen. An
anthology series, it is filling in for ``The ABC Mystery Movie,'' a
rotating movie series that will include a rejuvenated ``Columbo,''
starring Peter Falk, that is delayed until January.
   CBS has already begun running the sitcoms ``The Cavanaughs,''
which will be replaced when ``Coming of Age'' comes in Oct. 31, and
``First Impressions,'' which was to have been a mid-season
replacement, but fills in for ``Raising Miranda,'' which premieres
Nov. 5.
   Some of the interim programming will never get on the air
because once the strike was settled, some new shows were delayed by
only a few weeks. NBC has kept an option for instance on ``The
Hardy Boys,'' but doesn't plan to do more than a movie or so
instead of the series.
   CBS bought but has yet to give an air date to ``Jake's
Journey,'' a funny, Monty Python-esque fantasy-comedy in which an
American teen-ager takes up with an medieval knight, played by
Monty Python's Graham Chapman. Also yet to get an air date from CBS
is ``Dolphin Bay,'' a family drama set around a scientist studying
dolphins in Australia. Shades of ``Flipper.''
   Some other ``reality-based'' fillers:
   CBS has ``High Risk,'' a magazine-type show that features
reports on people with dangerous jobs or hobbies. It will be
replaced Nov. 29 by ``TV 101,'' a back-to-school drama about kids
learning to make a television newscast.
   Beginning Oct. 29, ABC has ``Trackdown,'' another ``America's
Most Wanted''-type show. In this one, viewers watch police bring in
parole violators. It fills in for the George Segal crime drama
``Murphy's Law,'' which makes its debut Dec. 3.
   CBS is offering an entertainment series, ``Live! Dick Clark
Presents,'' which has already premiered and runs until Oct. 26 when
the sitcoms ``The Van Dyke Show'' and the as-yet untitled new Mary
Tyler Moore show premiere.
   Strike-proof shows that seem to have made the schedule without
caveat are NBC's ``Unsolved Mysteries,'' a weekly magazine series
based on the highly successful specials of last season, and ABC's
``Incredible Sunday,'' a rejuvenation of ``That's Incredible!''

   The Public Broadcasting Service, a steady
customer of British programming in the past, is keeping most new
programming on this side of the Atlantic in 1988-89. Unfortunately,
the result would seem to suggest we're not very entertaining over
here.
   All the new series are about Americans, Mexicans or Canadians,
but none of it is going to bring floods of new viewers to public
television _ except perhaps for the one bald-faced attempt to lure
commercial network audiences, a special on the making of NBC's hit
comedy, ``Family Ties.''
   Of the new series, the most interesting would appear to be
``American Experience,'' a history anthology; ``The Mind,'' a
sequel to ``The Brain,'' and ``CE News Magazine,'' a children's
news show.
   The good, old standbys, ``Great Performances'' and ``Masterpiece
Theatre,'' are still coming up with promising if not
ground-breaking fare. ``Great Performances'' will have more
episodes of those fine ``Tales From the Hollywood Hills'' in
November, and ``Masterpiece Theatre'' kicks off Oct. 16 with a
seven-part dramatization of John le Carre's ``A Perfect Spy.''
   Jeremy Brett returns as Sherlock Holmes' on the ``Mystery!''
series, which premieres Oct. 13 with a production of the Terrence
Rattigan stage play ``Cause Celebre.'' ``Wonderworks,'' the
anthology series aimed at adolescents but much admired by adults,
begins Nov. 5 with ``Necessary Parties,'' a story of a family
breakup starring Alan Arkin and Barbara Dana. And Bill Moyers is
back with more interesting interviews.
   Here are the new series:
   _``American Experience,'' premiering Oct. 4, is a history
anthology featuring observations and remembrances by notable
citizens and filmmakers. The first episode is producer Tom
Weidlinger's ``The Great San Francisco Earthquake,'' including
newly restored archival film and present-day inteviews with
witnesses of the disaster. The atomic bomb, Indians, presidential
races and music are subjects of later episodes.
   _``The Mind'' is an ambitious sequel to the 1984 PBS series
``The Brain.'' This time, the series delves into the nature of
consciousness through episodes on aging, addiction, pain,
depression, thinking and violence, among others. There are many
fascinating case studies along the way.
   _``Bill Moyers' World of Ideas'' is a nightly series of
interviews with an interesting array of authors, scientists and
philosophers. It premiered in September and runs through Nov. 18.
   _``CE News Magazine'' is a children's news show, reported by
kids recruited from the ranks of ``Children's Express,'' the
children's newspaper that has occasionally scooped the adult news
media. The kids, minus the cynicism of their adult counterparts,
will tackle such tough subjects as, in the premiere Oct. 13, the
ease with which parents can put unruly children in private mental
institutions. Other stories will be about homeless children,
homosexual teen-agers, the toy industry and life in a welfare hotel.
   _``Canada: True North,'' a four-part series that began Sept. 12
and ends Oct. 3, is an examination of the history of Canada, its
present-day culture and its relationship with the United States.
The host is Canadian-born Robert MacNeil of PBS' ``The
MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour.''
   _``Mexico,'' no premiere date yet, is a three-part examination
of that country's modern history, beginning with the 1910
revolution and the emergence of the Partido Revolucionario
Institutional, the party that ruled Mexico until the hotly disputed
1988 election that seems to have ended one-party dominance.
   _``Global Rivals'' is a four-part series that premiered Sept. 20
and analyzes conflicts between the Soviet Union and the United
States. The host is journalist and former Assistant Secretary of
State Bernard Kalb.
   _``The Power of Choice'' follows Michael Pritchard, youth
counselor and comedian, to 22 high schools across the country as he
encourages kids, through humor, to talk out their problems. The
series starts Oct. 15.
   _``Ramona'' is a fictional series based on best-selling author
Beverly Cleary's books about Ramona Quimby, who suffers from all
the mortifications familiar to anyone who is growing up or
remembers doing so. The series began Sept. 10.
   _``Life Matters,'' premiering Oct. 9, is a 13-part series that
presents inspiring stories of people who cope with serious disease
or other medical problems, including AIDS, cancer, depression and
sight loss.
   This season's specials on PBS aren't terribly special, except
perhaps for ``All Night Strut,'' a celebration of 1930s and 1940s
swing music, with host Maxene Andrews of The Andrews Sisters; and
``Cary Grant: The Leading Man,'' a profile of the legendary screen
star. There's also a National Geographic special, ``The Explorers:
A Century of Discovery.''
   Other specials include a salute to Australia's bicentennial; a
no doubt riveting examination of the Munich Peace Pact on its 50th
anniversary, and ``Pyramid,'' an inquiry into the mystery of the
crypts that sounds more like a candidate for a Geraldo Rivera
special than a PBS documentary, but could be pretty interesting.

   Made-for-TV movies ``based on a true story'' are
coming so close on the heels of the real event that maybe we'll
soon just have the movie and skip the event _ ``World War III:
Available NOW on Video!''
   Liberace died only last year, but ABC and CBS are ready to air
made-for-TV movies based on his life in early October.
   Last October, Jessica McClure dropped down a well in Midland,
Texas. Her story will be on ABC this season. Ryan White, the
hemophiliac teen-ager with AIDS, is still in the news, but his
ordeal with a town that shunned him will be made for TV this
season. So will the story of ``David,'' the boy whose father set
him afire in a custody dispute five years ago.
   The space shuttle program is still struggling to recover from
the Challenger explosion, but the disaster is supposed to come to
the small screen this season as a docudrama, also on ABC. By
comparison, ``The Final Days,'' an ABC dramatization of the Bob
Woodward-Carl Bernstein book about the end of Richard Nixon's
presidency, looks like ancient history.
   CBS apparently wasn't as quick to grab up recent true stories,
so it will go back as far as singer Karen Carpenter, who died from
complications of anorexia, the eating disorder, for one
biographical movie. Another true-life CBS movie concerns a doctor
who was the first to detect AIDS in children.
   CBS' ``Jack the Ripper'' is based on a true story that became
the stuff of much fancy and legend. Another fact-based historical
movie is ``Day One,'' about the Manhattan Project and the race to
build an atomic bomb.
   In the area of fiction, CBS has Larry McMurtry's novel
``Lonesome Dove,'' which will be an eight-hour miniseries, one of
the longer ones these days.
   This season may mark the end of the era of super-long, big-event
miniseries _ which actually seemed to end with ``Amerika,'' but ABC
has had a long-term commitment to Herman Wouk's ``War and
Remembrance,'' the 30-hour sequel to ``The Winds of War.'' Eighteen
hours of the miniseries will air in November.
   ABC's ``Roots: Kunta Kinte's Gift'' reunites LeVar Burton (Kunta
Kinte) and Louis Gossett Jr. (Fiddler) in a question for freedom
that will air around Christmas.
   NBC, which has a strong regular series lineup and no new ideas
other than ripping off already successful ventures, offers, not
surprisingly, little of excitement in movies and miniseries _
although they do provide off-season projects for NBC series stars.
   Pierce Brosnan (``Remington Steele'') stars in a six-hour remake
of ``Around the World in 80 Days.'' Harry Hamlin (``L.A. Law'')
stars in ``Favorite Son,'' a political drama.
   Christopher Reeve (no NBC credit), Judd Hirsch (``Dear John''),
Anthony Denison (``Crime Story'') and Charles Haid (``Hill Street
Blues'') star in ``The Great Escape: The Final Chapter.''
   To its credit, though, NBC does have in development _ with no
air date set _ ``And the Band Played On,'' Randy Shilts' highly
praised, non-fiction account of the political, medical and social
ramifications of AIDS. Another worthy NBC project is ``Selma, Lord,
Selma,'' from the producers of ``The Cosby Show,'' a fact-based
drama about the civil rights movement in Alabama as seen through
the eyes of two young girls.

   ``Roseanne'' gets a primo time period amid ABC's
hit Tuesday night lineup, but even without the VIP treatment, it
deserves to be a hit.
   ``Roseanne'' is from the same people who created ``The Cosby
Show,'' although Roseanne and her brood are certainly no Cosby
family. ``This is why some animals eat their young,'' cracks
Roseanne Barr, after breaking up yet another squabble among her
boisterous offspring.
   Barr, a standup comic who does housewife humor cut with feminist
and blue-collar politics, plays Roseanne Parker, the tough-talking
mama of two pre-pubescent daughters and a son. She works in a
plastics factory with a crew of lovable misfits, including her
sister, a sucker always signing up for the latest get-rich-quick
seminar. ``What's this one, `Dare to be a Millionaire?'' Roseanne
inquires when her sister pitches the latest one.
   John Goodman (``Raising Arizona,'' ``True Stories'') is perfect
as Roseanne's husband, Dan. A huggable bear of a guy, he quickly
proves he can hold his own against his funny, snide, gum-popping
co-star.
   ``Is there coffee?'' he asks when he makes his entrance at
breakfast.
   Roseanne regards him with disbelief. ``Isn't there always
coffee?''
   He pauses, suspiciously cautious. ``Yeeessss.''
   ``In the 15 years that we been married have you ever come down
in the morning and there wasn't any coffee?''
   He's still careful. ``Noooo.''
   ``Then why do you always ask, `Is there coffee?'''
   Pause. ``Is there toast?''
   Lecy Goranson plays Becky, the boy-crazy daughter. Sara Gilbert
is Darlene, the tomboy. Laurie Metcalf is Roseanne's sister,
Jackie. Natalie West is gullible co-worker Crystal. George Clooney
plays the handsome plant foreman, Booker.
   In the premiere episode, Roseanne gets stuck with all the kids'
errands after working her full-time job because Dan, an independent
contractor, says he'll be busy putting in a bid on a job. When it
turns out he ended up at a friend's house goofing off, Roseanne
goes on a rampage about shared responsibilities. Just like in real
life, the conflict isn't resolved.
   ``Roseanne'' is not ``Married ... With Children,'' the Fox show
about sniping, unhappy marrieds and their ungrateful children.
Though they're never sentimental, Roseanne and her husband love
each other, and the show, besides being a very entertaining comedy,
also pays tribute to the unheralded working class and the brave
struggle to raise a family.

   In ABC's new drama ``Knightwatch,'' it's hard to
tell who the good guys are.
   That seems to be the point of the premiere of this murky film
noir about a Guardian Angels-type group whose members aspire to
defend citizens on the mean streets of New York, but who
occasionally go over the bounds of accepted law enforcement
practices _ as when one of them throws a suspect off a building.
   Eventually it becomes apparent that the Knights are indeed the
good guys, even if they are struggling a bit in their search for a
meaningful value system amid the squalor of their ghetto
neighborhood.
   In the premiere episode, a hero emerges: handsome Calvin (Dan
Franklin), a good-as-gold, blue-collar kid who wants to follow in
his late father's public-service footsteps.
   Calvin becomes the focal point of the group's moral dilemma when
he cops to the cops that his partner, John, threw a would-be rapist
off a roof. The rest of the Knights shun him, and after wrestling
with his conscience, he discards his Knights jacket.
   To deal with his angst, Calvin rides his motorcycle to a
soundtrack of rock music.
   Meanwhile, the group's leader, Tony (Benjamin Bratt),
alternately charms and menaces a female TV news reporter doing a
story he hopes will raise some money for the Knights. She has
questionable ethics of her own when she suggests he might want to
dress down for the interview in order to look more needy.
   Tom Bower plays Father Jim, the overburdened priest who shelters
the Knights in his church basement.
   The young cast is talented, but ``Knightwatch's'' sophisticated
intent is bogged down by ragged execution. Opposite ``The Cosby
Show,'' it'll offer an alternative to kids who don't want to be
cheered up. But it's unlikely that very many will want to watch
``Knightwatch.''

   In the concluding scene in the pilot of CBS'
``Almost Grown,'' Norm and Suzie sit in a car listening to a rock
station on the radio. They have changed in the 20-odd years since
they met, but the music has not.
   ``Those same three chords,'' Norm says. ``It's good to know
there's something you can count on.''
   ``Almost Grown'' is an ambitious history of a marriage, set
against that nebulous force that formed a generation who came of
age in the '60s and '70s _ rock 'n' roll.
   The show inevitably will be compared to ABC's
``thirtysomething,'' since it deals with a couple in their 30s and
the foibles of the New Age 1980s and is designed to appeal to baby
boomers.
   But it's a unique, engaging show that deserves a look on its own
merit. Timothy Daly and Eve Gordon star as Norman and Suzie. Each
episode intends to flash back from the present to the pre-Beatles
1960s, when Norm and Suzie were in high school, and-or 1971-ish,
when they were college revolutionaries.
   All three phases are equally evocative, and Daly and Gordon
manage to play the couple convincingly from high school to
impending middle age.
   The two-hour pilot, premiering Nov. 27, begins with Norm finding
Suzie in a store's shoe department, wearing a white wedding gown.
It flashes back to their meeting in high school, when Norm was the
goody-goody best friend of Suzie's brother Joey (Albert Macklin)
and Suzie was a wild child, hanging out with Angelo, the hood. She
develops a crush on Norm and hears ``Today I Met the Boy I'm Gonna
Marry'' on the radio.
   By 1971, they are living together at college. He's a disc jockey
on the university radio station, she's an aspiring documentary
filmmaker out to change the world. They spout free love, but become
jealous. Suzie walks out after getting the message via The Chambers
Brothers' ``Time Has Come Today.''
   Cut to the '80s. Two children later, she is a technical
filmmaker working in a medical lab. He is a program director at a
radio station. They are divorced, and Suzie is about to get married
again, to a saintly, globe-trotting doctor who performs cosmetic
surgery on victims of disasters.
   By the end of the pilot, we come full circle and learn why Suzie
was trying on shoes in a wedding dress.
   The writing could be punched up, but with its realistic
references, like a 1971 remark about the hallucinogen psilocybin,
and offbeat touches, such as a Satanist butler in 1988, ``Almost
Grown'' could develop a following.
   Daly, brother of Tyne Daly of ``Cagney & Lacey, takes up sis'
old time period, Monday nights at 10 p.m. ET.

   She's a single gal, a spunky single gal, living
in a pastel New York. Mom hovers nearby, fussing and worried but
basically supportive. There's only one camera and no laugh track.
   Based on the premiere episode, it might seem that CBS has booked
``The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd'' instead of Mary Tyler Moore's
as yet untitled show for its Wednesday night schedule.
   There's even a cute Molly Dodd-style misunderstanding when Mary,
who works for the city government, tries to straighten out a
licensing problem for a hulking, dirty hot dog vendor who speaks
six words of English. Mom mistakes the hulk for the sensitive,
good-looking beau Mary has been bragging about.
   This might have worked with the neurotic Molly, who was just
desperate enough to fall for the hot-dog man. But Mary, our Mary,
would never ever be so needy, and the bit falls flat. She goes from
a cute meeting to a marriage proposal in one easy episode.
   It's been 11 years, and two failed shows, since Mary Tyler Moore
left the newsroom in Minneapolis. As Lucille Ball found in her
brief, disastrous return to series television two years ago, you
can ride about one week on good will. Next week you need a good
script.
   The first half-hour is a lukewarm start at best, with Mary given
awful lines such as this about her ex-husband: ``I married a man
with principles but no property, but I left a man with property but
no principles.''
   The show will be about a married Mary, and the first episode
lays out the possibilities for conflict. She is a former Peace
Corps member, he's an ex-Marine. She engages her son in dialogue,
he gives his kids orders. Her Mom is an old leftist who spouts
slogans about ``the masses,'' his Dad is so far right that he takes
his vacations at West Point.
   A key to the show's success will be the development of co-star
Edward J. Moore, who is handsome and sensitive _ yeah, another way
of saying dull _ in the first episode. He has to do better.
   Mary does have strong support in Mom, Eileen Heckart, a 1972
Oscar winner for her supporting role in ``Butterflies are Free'';
and John Randolph, a Tony Award winner for his featured role in
``Broadway Bound'' in 1987, who plays her new father-in-law.
   Mary's fate on Tuesday night, opposite ABC's ``Head of the
Class'' and NBC's ``Unsolved Mysteries,'' partly depends on the
success of former co-star Dick Van Dyke, who is also returning to
series television.
   The Van Dyke show was not available for review, which is not a
good omen for the former Mr. and Mrs. Rob Petrie.

   Credit ``TV 101'' with truth in titling _ it's
not for advanced viewers. However, this production from Grant
Tinker's new GTG Entertainment for CBS figures to be one of the
season's better offerings for the teen audience.
   ``TV 101'' may confront teens with some of the hard issues that
television rarely even puts before adults.
   It's also a rare instance of television looking at itself, with
the cameras following a high school class learning to use
television instead of publishing the usual newspaper. Jumpy amateur
camera work mixed with the professional work keeps the pace lively,
although looking through the viewfinder quickly gets old.
   Sam Robards stars as Kevin Keegan, a 29-year-old video producer
who is lured into a teaching job by his old high school journalism
teacher, Emily Walker (Brynn Thayer), who's not so much older.
Let's issue a preliminary ``Mrs. Robinson'' alert here, and see
what develops.
   Keegan may be pathetic when he's in his dirty living room,
mooning over his broken marriage and his distant daughter, but back
at FDR High he has all the swagger that made him such a terror as a
teen-age Horace Greeley. Maybe his old nemesis, the dim-witted
reactionary principal Edward Steadman (Leon Russam), gets his
juices flowing.
   The journalism class is a most appealing collection of young
talent. The focus in the first episode is on Andrew White, who
plays bright underachiever Vance Checker.
   Checker is first spied smoking dope in the parking lot, but
don't worry about the show being soft on drugs. Drugs lead to
death. Fortuitously, the death also makes for some compelling video
that helps the student station overcome the opposition of the
principal.
   Yes, ``TV 101'' tends to slam its messages home and events
unfold in predictable fashion, but the lessons are skillfully
sugar-coated. With its high school setting, ``TV 101'' is
positioned to explore any and all issues of interest to teens.
   It deserves a look, though it faces hard competition on Tuesday
night from ABC's ``Who's the Boss'' and NBC's ``Matlock.''

   Most of the people involved in ``Murphy Brown''
need to be slapped _ hard _ for their own good. They're messing up
what could have been one of the bright shows of the new season.
   Candice Bergen is terrific in the lead role of a driven network
star, sort of a tall Barbara Walters, who plunges back into the
stresses of the job after a month drying out at the Betty Ford
Clinic.
   Bergen is elegant, understated and believable. However, her
supporting cast adopts a buffoonish style better suited to the Moe,
Larry and Shemp production of ``Marat-Sade.''
   The worst offender is Grant Shaud, who plays young executive
producer Miles Silverberg. It's a funny idea that Murphy's boss is
a short, nerdy Harvard MBA, but Shaud isn't allowed to stop there.
He acts like a disturbed adolescent, reduced to hugging a desk and
all but drooling after the climax of the episode.
   In the premiere, Murphy gets an exclusive interview with a man
who has been romantically linked with a candidate for vice
president, who already has a husband. The interview is offered on
condition that Murphy not ask the big question _ did he sleep with
the candidate? Murphy asks anyway.
   Incredibly, we don't see his reaction to this double-cross.
There isn't a clue why Miles is gibbering at the end of the
interview, which should have been ambush journalism at its best.
   The script of the first episode also suffers from toilet humor,
including the possibility of mispronouncing ``Shiite'' and milking
a cheap laugh about tampons.
   However, there are glimmers of a great show struggling for air _
particularly in Murphy's first meeting with the male bimbo. ``I'll
bet that sheepish grin of yours got you pretty far,'' the
suspicious Murphy tells him.
   How far will Murphy go? CBS has given the show a sporting chance
with a 9 p.m. Monday slot leading into ``Designing Women,''
competing with ABC's ``Monday Night Football'' and NBC's Monday
movie.
   ``Murphy Brown'' could be smart and stylish, this season's
``L.A. Law.'' It needs to get off Gilligan's Island, and fast.

   Judd Hirsch is back on television, once again
the sad sack in a crew as strange as the bunch on ``Taxi.''
   Hirsch plays the newly divorced John Lacey, who returns to New
York City after being booted out of his suburban home by an
unfaithful wife. This is not glittering Manhattan, either, but
frumpy, funky Rego Park in Queens where John hopes to start over.
   To that end, he tries to join a singles club. When he mistakenly
wanders into an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting and explains that
there weren't any signs, the group leader demands, ``Well, what did
you expect? `Emotionally Shattered This Way,' `Lushes to Your
Left?'''
   No one needs to paint a ``losers'' sign to explain the ``One to
One Club'' or its leader, Louise Mercer (Jane Carr). Louise isn't
very interested in the members as people, but she is insatiably
curious about any sexual problems that might have broken up their
marriages.
   Jere Burns has the delicious role of Kirk, the self-made lounge
lizard who acts and talks alarmingly like Dan Aykroyd in the old
``two wild and crazy guys'' sketches with Steve Martin on
``Saturday Night Live.''
   ``Stick with me, you're gonna make out like a bandit,'' Kirk
tell John. Eyeing the room, Kirk adds, ``We could really get our
turkeys tetrazzinied in this place.''
   Barry Groener is Ralph, whose Bulgarian wife left him five hours
after the wedding ceremony, and Isabella Hofmann plays a normal
woman _ at least in the first episode _ who seems destined for a
larger role in John's life.
   The show reunites Hirsch with Ed. Weinberger, one of the
executive producers of ``Taxi'' and a veteran of ``The Mary Tyler
Moore Show.''
   Given its strong cast, good writing and Thursday night timeslot
after ``Cheers'' on NBC, ``Dear John'' figures to be around a while.

   Right off, you know this is no ordinary show:
   ``Call me Angel,'' says the disembodied voice at the bottom of
the grave, our vantage point as we see Jack Killian (Gary Cole)
standing above. ``That's Jack Killian. He put me here, but I don't
blame him.''
   The alert viewer will immediately realize the two possibilities
for NBC's ``Midnight Caller.'' It is either a delicious semi-satire
on film noir detective movies, or a mindless, self-important crime
drama that a network mistook for daring television.
   Oh, just take a wild guess.
   Angel, we learn, is a murderess _ in a wedding dress, no less _
put to rest by Killian, a former San Francisco cop turned
late-night radio talk-show host who occasionally steps out of the
booth to blow away bad guys, or gals as the case may be.
   We know Killian's a sharp talker because in a flashback he
regales his partner with oh-so-funny tall tales about meeting
Elvis. But the laughs end when the two cops get tripped up by drug
dealers and Killian accidentally blows his partner away.
   Killian is sitting around wallowing in self-pity and presumably
wasting good one-liners, so enter Devon King _ who makes up these
names? _ played by Wendy Kilbourne, who owns a radio station and
needs a late-night talk guy. She hires Killian to dispense crime
prevention advice and otherwise entertain people who are up in the
middle of the night telephoning radio stations.
   In between Killian's witty radio repartee _ ``That's my name,
don't wear it out'' for pete's sake _ he inadvertently elicits
call-ins from killers.
   Such is Angel, a hooker who demands that her customers love her,
or else. Turns out her boyfriend threw her over and married another
gal. That'll turn 'em into serial killers every time.
   Cole is a smoldering presence, and ``Midnight Caller'' is quite
stylish, owing no doubt to co-executive producer Robert Butler, who
directed the pilots of ``Hill Street Blues'' and ``Moonlighting.''
   But a show about clever talk needs some clever writing, and
``Midnight Caller'' doesn't have it.
   Artistic justice being what it is on network television, that
probably won't matter, because ``Midnight Caller'' will undoubtedly
appeal to the all-important male 18-34 demographic, and NBC has put
it up against Tuesday night's female-appeal ``thirtysomething'' on
ABC and a historically low-rated movie on CBS.

<HEAD>George Segal Wreaks Revenge on Television</HEAD>

   Hardly anyone felt bad, or even noticed, when
``Kooper with a `K,''' starring George Segal, suffered sudden death
on CBS last season. It's real cause for regret now, however,
because Segal was freed to do his worst in ``Murphy's Law'' for ABC.
   In truth, the title should be ``Sam Spade Meets the Avengers and
Impersonates Columbo.''
   Murphy is a down-at-the-heels dick in San Francisco who adores
Yeats and Keats, wears an old raincoat and lusts after a Eurasian
model who has fabulous gams and shares his amazingly colorful
residence.
   ``Am I not fey?'' his character seems to say. ``Is my battered
fedora not angled rakishly? Does my rumpled raincoat not evoke pity
and amusement?''
   Maggie Han, who plays girlfriend Kamiko Fannuchi, is the only
excuse to watch the show, though even her smart, sassy character
loses luster once she succumbs to Murphy's labored attempts at
charm.
   The ``Avengers'' connection appears in the comic-book villain,
an Oriental guru who is suspected of murdering a wealthy disciple.
Murphy finds the guru in a lotus position before a complex model
train layout of the New York City subway system. There are even
tiny plastic muggers on one platform.
   John Steed would have raised an eyebrow about one-eighth of an
inch; Segal registers shock, horror and indignation _ a face-warp
that is his standard reaction to most any development.
   The audience, meanwhile, registers revulsion as Segal pulls out
the vox humana stop and revs up the tremolo as he fights for
visitation rights with his 10-year-old daughter. He's never
actually met the girl, what with being colorful and dissolute and
drunk, but judge, can't you see he has a heart o' gold?
   The mother, who has fabulous gams, interrupts her chain-smoking
just long enough to hurl abuse at Murphy. However, when Murphy is
gone, she tells her attorney, ``I wouldn't gloat, Charles. He's
still twice the man you'll ever be.''
   Gee whiskers, they just don't write dialogue like that anymore.
For this, ABC canceled ``Spenser: For Hire''?
   ``Murphy'' gets a break that ABC's programmers seldom gave
``Spenser.'' This show isn't up against NBC's popular ``Hunter,''
but comes on at 8 p.m. EST on Saturday, where it is unlikely to
beat either ``227'' or ``Amen'' on NBC.

   As if the fact that it comes from the same
producers weren't enough, NBC is even giving ``Tattinger's'' the
old ``St. Elsewhere'' time slot.
   If that wonderful and late-lamented show was a square peg in a
round hole, ``Tattinger's'' is a trapezoid. It seems that NBC's
Wednesday 10 p.m. slot is set aside for television that defies
categories, the network's lost-and-found.
   ``Tattinger's'' seems to be aiming for classy-though-absurd, but
it tries too hard to be wacky, a quality that came naturally to
``St. Elsewhere.''
   While ``Tattinger's'' looks for an identity, the search party is
pretty intriguing.
   First there's Nick Tattinger, played with aplomb by the
underrated Stephen Collins. He's a street-fighter who has turned
business sense and personal charm into a successful Manhattan
restaurant that serves the swells and acts as the backdrop to drama
of both the crime and family variety.
   Nick's ex-wife Hillary, played by Blythe Danner as a good-sport
socialite, is trying to raise two teen-age daughters and establish
a meaningful relationship with the quintessential good man, Norman
(Simon Jones).
   Mary Beth Hurt doesn't appear in the pilot but will play the
chef. Jerry Stiller is Sid, the restaurant manager and Nick's loyal
friend. British actor-director Roderick Cook is a snotty
headwaiter. Patrice Colihan and Chay Lentin play the Tattinger
daughters, Nina and Winnifred. Why would a guy like Nick let his
kid be named Winnifred?
   In the premiere episode, airing Oct. 26, Nick has returned from
Paris where he fled after a deranged drug dealer took a potshot at
him. Zach Grenier, who somehow manages to make his eyes roll in
different directions, will apparently be a regular as gun-happy
degenerate Sonny Franks.
   Nick had sold the restaurant, but when an evil real estate
developer tries to muscle the residents of the ``Tattinger's''
block _ Jack Gilford has a cameo as Shlomo, the newsstand operator
_ the juices start flowing, and Nick just can't resist a good fight.
   By the end of the episode, he has reclaimed the restaurant and
set up a line of sexual tension with his ex-wife, who has delivered
the ultimatum that he is to be a good father or good-bye.
   So he'll try to be both a junkyard dog and a debutante's dad.
When he shows up disheveled at Nina's coming out party, she
complains, ``Why you be like the other fathers? They never get shot
at.''
   The Gershwin-like theme music heralds the co-star of the show,
New York City, where ``Tattinger's'' is filmed. The creators'
combination of affection and fear for their locale is tangible.
   Although the pilot is not terribly impressive, there's too much
talent behind ``Tattinger's'' to write it off. It's a character
piece that will take time to evolve. Perhaps as it did with ``St.
Elsewhere,'' NBC will give it some.

<TEXT>
   ``Empty Nest,'' an addition to NBC's Saturday
night schedule, has one outstanding performer, an actor who can
convincingly convey love or impatience or gratitude with the twitch
of an eyebrow.
   Unfortunately, Bear is confined in a small supporting role as
Dreyfuss, dog and confidant to Dr. Harry Weston (Richard Mulligan).
   Harry, who has been widowed 18 months, fusses over three
daughters: Carol (Dinah Manoff), whose husband recently left her;
Barbara (Kristy McNichol), who is a cop; and Emily, who phones
frequently from college.
   Next-door neighbor Charley (David Leisure, the lying salesman
from the Isuzu ads) drops in frequently, while Harry's office is
supervised by nurse Laverne (Park Overall).
   One hoped-for episode of ``Empty Nest'' would send Charley and
Laverne on a cruise to the Bermuda triangle. Laverne is especially
annoying, doing jokes in which the punchline is some variation on
``I'm from Arkansas'' (therefore I am a hopeless hick). The state
should sue.
   ``Empty Nest,'' by the producers of ``Golden Girls,''
exemplifies this year's ``more of the same'' programming philosophy
at NBC. It follows right after ``Golden Girls'' on the Saturday
night schedule and is set in the same Miami neighborhood.
   If that philosophy worked for Lisa Bonet in the ``Different
World'' spinoff from ``The Cosby Show,'' why not for a Saint
Bernard-German shepherd-golden retriever mix?
   There's nothing really wrong with ``Empty Nest'' and nothing to
particularly recommend it. The show runs half an hour and has
commercial breaks, which fills the time for NBC. Maybe it will do
the same for others.

   In the never-ending struggle to find something
to run against NBC's hit comedy lineup on Thursdays, CBS is trying
another genre _ the Western.
   Lee Horsley (``Matt Houston'') returns to prime-time television
as Ethan Allen Cord (no relation to the furniture folks), a
mysterious gunslinger who inherits a passel of young 'uns when his
sister dies back East.
   It seems since he sent her a picture of himself standing in
front of the town's dry goods store, his dying sister mistook him
for a successful businessman who would make a perfect dad for her
kids. Instead, he's a down-at-the-heels gunfighter who's running
from a slew of bad guys and is temporarily holed up in the
depressed mining town of Paradise.
   Although the writing needs to be beefed up, the series admirably
aspires to a lean, terse, authentic feel, and Horsley, in real life
a Colorado horseman, was made to play Westerns. In the pilot, Cord
tries to shield the kids from his violent way of life, even as the
boys become fascinated by gunplay and Cord seeks revenge against
the men who shot him.
   The kids are inoffensive in the pilot. They are 13-year-old
Claire, played by Jenny Beck; 11-year-old Joseph (Matthew Newmark);
8-year-old Benjamin (Brian Lando), and 5-year-old George, played by
Michael Carter.
   They could provide some kid appeal if the show were at an
earlier time, but it is sandwiched between distinctly adult hours,
CBS news show ``48 Hours'' and the night-time soap ``Knots
Landing.''
   To get a more adult audience, the series could and should make
more of the romantic tension between the handsome desperado Cord
and the ice queen Amelia Lawson, the local merchant played by the
fine Sigrid Thornton (``Man from Snowy River'').
   ``Paradise'' premieres Oct. 27 and is on opposite NBC's hit
comedy lineup on Thursday, a timeslot that is definitely not
paradise.

   ``Baby Boom'' is perhaps intended to appeal to
two types of viewers _ single women whose biological clocks are in
alarm mode and single mothers who wish raising a child was that
easy.
   Another instance of NBC's current ``nothing-but-clones''
programming philosophy, ``Baby Boom'' isn't just based on the film
starring Diane Keaton. It is produced by the same people and has
the same guy (Sam Wanamaker) playing the boss, plus the same kid _
actually the twins Michelle and Kristina Kennedy.
   Kate Jackson takes over the lead role of J.C. Wiatt, a tigress
of industry who quite accidentally acquires a baby. This 2-year-old
seemingly travels alone across the Atlantic, and arrives via a
freight company. Viewers who swallow that are what the advertising
community calls a desirable audience.
   J.C. has oodles of money, a Harvard education, a nanny, a huge
apartment and a toddler who doesn't cry. The biggest prroblem to be
solved in the first episode is finding the child's blanket, and
J.C. is absolutely equal to the challenge.
   ``Baby Boom'' is about angst among the pampered, which is far
down on anyone's list of important or interesting problems.
   The show may at least answer the question of whether two babies
are cuter than one John Ritter, whose ``Hooperman'' on ABC is the
competition on Wednesday night, along with CBS' ``The Equalizer.''

   A producer's nightmare:
   You make a nice, thoughtful little show about a single dad
trying to raise a teen-age daughter. First, a writers' strike
delays the show. Next, the network gives it a lousy time period and
changes the show's name. Then the network holds the lousy time
period until the show's premiere with a really dumb show that has
the same premise.
   You wake up in a cold sweat after dreaming the headline _
``Network Show Gets Zero Rating for First Time in History!''
   James Naughton stars as Donald, the single dad in CBS' ``Raising
Miranda'' (formerly ``Close to Home''). Co-starring as Miranda is
one of the better child actors to show up on television, Royana
Black.
   In the pilot, Donald's ditzy wife goes out shopping and never
comes back, although she does phone to inform him she must ``find
herself.''
   This idea has been done to death. Today's TV dads are all
widowed or abandoned _ ``My Two Dads,'' ``Full House,'' ``Who's the
Boss?'' ``The Hogan Family,'' ``Empty Nest'' and, of course, the
silly ``First Impressions,'' which had the ``Miranda'' premise and
time period and made a mess of both.
   ``Raising Miranda'' does it better. The cast is excellent,
especially Naughton as the well-meaning but clumsy dad, and Black
as a smart kid grappling with the the confusion of adolescence.
   Miriam Flynn and Steve Vinovich play long-married neighbors.
There's comic relief and a potentially interesting character in
Bryan Cranston's Uncle Russell, the '60s burnout brother of
Donald's now-absent wife who intends to remain on the premises
living in his van in the driveway.
   The characters in the pilot are written too broadly, but that
tends to sort itself out if a show stays on the air long enough.
   ``Raising Miranda'' is from GTG Entertainment, Grant Tinker's
new production company. Of note: Michael Kozoll, the co-creator and
early co-writer of ``Hill Street Blues,'' is listed as ``executive
consultant'' on the show.
   ``Miranda'' is on Saturday, CBS' lowest night of viewing, so the
ratings will be poor. It's a respectable show that deserves better.

<TEXT>
   On screen, NBC anchorwoman Jessica Savitch was
television's ``Golden Girl'' _ authoritative, beautiful,
intelligent. Off screen, the glitter quickly vanished.
   Five years after her death, two biographies dig beneath the
radiant image. Though Savitch's family and friends dispute their
findings, both books describe a life marred by drugs, psychological
problems, her husband's suicide and intense ambition.
   ``Her whole life was a suicide mission,'' says Alanna Nash,
author of ``Golden Girl'' (E.P. Dutton, $18.95).
   Gwenda Blair, author of ``Almost Golden'' (Simon & Schuster,
$18.95), says Savitch was the wrong woman in the wrong place at the
wrong time.
   ``Drive and ambition certainly got her to the top, but it didn't
provide her with the stability needed to withstand the pressure of
that place in the sun. But even more than that, the changes that
were taking place in the news industry that both elevated her and
punished her is worth telling.''
   Popular with viewers but not with most colleagues, Savitch
skyrocketed to television stardom in the 1970s, first as a local
anchor on Philadelphia's KYW and then as anchor of NBC's ``Weekend
News Digest.''
   By the late 1970s, the petite blonde with the uncanny knack of
romancing the television camera was dubbed ``NBC's Golden Girl'' by
Newsweek magazine.
   Five years later, her star fading, she and New York Post
executive Martin Fischbein drowned when her car toppled into a
canal in Bucks County, Pa.
   The medical examiner's report said drugs were not involved.
However, both books argue that Savitch had a cocaine problem that
had crippled her career.
   There was evidence of instability early on. Her main ambition
was to become the first female network anchor, and to do it by time
she was 30.
   She gave herself an edge _ she shaved a year off her age. But
then her dream was shattered when ABC hired Barbara Walters _ at $1
million a year _ to co-anchor the nightly newscast.
   ``Jessica's highly audible outrage lasted for a long time; then
she went into a corner of the (KYW) newsroom and cried,'' Nash
wrote.
   Her tirades and tantrums were legendary within the business,
according to the biographers. KYW cameras captured one particularly
vivid outburst in which Savitch berated the crew during a
commercial break _ ranting, raving, screaming _ and then coolly
returned to the newscast.
   KYW staffers set the videotape to music and sent it to Savitch's
new network colleagues at NBC before her arrival.
   As her star rose, so did her prima donna status. Besides
Walters, she was the only anchor-reporter to travel with an
entourage that included a driver, hairdresser, personal assistant
and secretary.
   Both books delve into her two marriages, a long affair with an
abusive news producer, the suicide of her second husband, Dr.
Donald Payne, and alleged lesbian liaisons; they differ in their
approach.
   Blair concentrates on the ``Selling of Television News,''
blaming much of Savitch's rise and fall on the nature of the
industry.
   She broke in at a time when television news was undecided
whether it was ``news, journalism or entertainment,'' Blair said.
   Savitch was often criticized as being a lightweight, a reporter
who had not paid her dues. Said Blair: ``At the time, she was
exactly what they wanted her to be: a pretty face who brought in
ratings.''
   Nash, on the other hand, delves into Savitch's background _ her
father's death of kidney disease at age 33, her chilly relationship
with her mother, her crippling insecurities.
   Citing several psychiatrists, including a few who treated
Savitch, Nash concludes that Savitch had a ``borderline''
personality disorder which is characterized by psychological
instability, impaired social behavior, mood swings and trouble with
interpersonal relationships.
   She argues that Savitch's problems can be traced to a childhood
incident when she argued with her father and then ran away, hiding
for hours in a field near her home. When she reappeared, her father
berated her and screamed that she would never amount to anything.
Soon after, he died.
   Savitch always believed she was the cause of his physical
deterioration, Nash said. Blair agreed: ``The person whose approval
she wanted the most (her father) she could never get.''
   Drugs, the authors said, fed all her other problems and led to
the destruction of her professional life. Those tuned into NBC News
Digest the night of Oct. 3, 1983, saw that destruction firsthand as
the anchorwoman appeared to suffer a breakdown on camera. She was
dead 20 days later.
   Savitch's mother and sisters, Stephanie and Lori, did not
cooperate with either author. Lori Savitch, an anchorwoman at her
older sister's former station KYW in Philadelphia, has denied her
sister was addicted to cocaine.
   Nash's book is the more gossipy of the two, full of details
about Savitch's troubled relationships with men.
   Some have questioned the purpose of such an intense and personal
review of Savitch's life, but both authors feel there's a lesson to
be learned.
   ``It is a cautionary tale and a sad one,'' said Nash.
   ``I think it's about the corrupting influence of fame, about
misplaced ambition. ... She was a woman who didn't know who she
was. She only existed on camera.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Running on Empty''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   What ever happened to the revolutionaries of the late '60s and
early '70s? The question bubbles below the placid surface of 1988
and one answer has arrived in a riveting new film.
   ``Running On Empty'' offers a story so current it is mimicked in
real life even as it is released. The recent surrender in Oakland,
Calif., of a '60s fugitive who gave up for the good of her children
is eerily close to the story Naomi Foner has written for the screen.
   The film is the story of Annie and Arthur Pope (Christine Lahti
and Judd Hirsch), fugitive leftovers from the days of violent
anti-Vietnam War protest. More significantly, it is the story of
their brilliant, musically gifted teen-age son Danny (River
Phoenix).
   ``Running on Empty'' is certain to be remembered as the film
that made Phoenix a star. The teen-ager with the '60s name has
intensity and dramatic control far beyond his years.
   Under Sidney Lumet's masterful direction, the viewer is drawn
quickly into the odyssey of the Popes who are wanted for the 1971
bombing of a defense intallation in which a janitor was maimed.
   Since then, they've been on the lam, moving from town to town as
the FBI came close, teaching their two young sons to live a lie.
The boys have new names in each new school and are careful never to
appear in a class picture. The parents hold jobs and derive
substantial support from a vague underground network. The ruse
works for 17 years.
   The crisis that propels this film is Danny's impending high
school graduation, his musical gift which demands further schooling
and his romance with the daughter of his music teacher. Young
Martha Plimpton as the girlfriend plays in perfect counterpoint to
Phoenix's sensitive, engaging Danny.
   The parents must decide whether to uproot Danny one more time.
   Hirsch, with the least sympathetic role as the self-involved,
aging radical father, summons up the most realistic reflection of
the radical life as it was.
   Lahti, an actress who displays new depths with every
performance, has the movie's most affecting scene in a reunion with
the grieving father she left behind. There wasn't a dry eye in the
house at a recent screening.
   Tackling such a prickly subject has pitfalls, and ``Running on
Empty'' has its flaws. The resolutions are too pat, the kids'
resilience strains credulity and the Norman Rockwell style settings
including a high school with the grandeur of Harvard are a bit
much. The rosy glow of conservative America pervades this film.
   The political passion beneath the Popes' predicament is barely
explored. Lahti offers the lame explanation: ``It was over when the
war was over.''
   But ``Running on Empty'' aims to win our hearts rather than our
minds, and it does that with great success.
   ``Running On Empty'' is rated PG-13 for its general subject
matter and the sexual affair between teen-agers.

<HEAD>Star Watch: `Eight Men Out' Director Pitches for Creative Film
Making</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stories of ``Eight Men Out''
and of its director and writer John Sayles begin at the same place,
with youth and innocence.
   The athletes in Sayles' movie about the 1919 World Series,
rigged by gamblers, love their work. For them, baseball is play.
Sayles, too, has a measure of that boyish pluck; he enjoys making
movies.
   The difference is that the baseball players sold out, throwing
the series for a few thousand dollars, ditching their virtue and
their futures in the process.
   Sayles has stood tall. Surrounded by the same kind of
deal-making and influence-peddling that proved toxic to the White
Sox, the 38-year-old Sayles has moved through Hollywood with his
integrity pretty much intact.
   He didn't give ``Eight Men Out'' a happy ending, as others might
have done.
   ``We wanted to make `Eight Men Out,' not `One Man Out' or `Two
Men Out' or whatever the more Hollywood version would be,'' Sayles
said. ``That seemed like taking a dive to us. That was a version of
throwing the series for us and we held out. It took us seven years,
but we got to do it eventually.''
   Sayles has had to personally raise the money for most of his
movies; it's the only way to get them made the way he wants them.
   But it's not a question of smugness. From 1983's ``Lianna'' (a
young woman copes with lesbianism) to 1984's ``Brother From Another
Planet'' (a black space alien visits Harlem) to last year's
``Matewan'' (coal miners strike in West Virginia), Sayles has
explored subjects that are politically riveting and brazenly
uncommercial.
   To support himself, he turned to commercial screenwriting,
including scripts for ``The Howling,'' ``Piranha,'' ``Clan of the
Cave Bear'' and the TV movie ``Unnatural Causes.''
   With ``Eight Men Out,'' starring John Cusak and David
Strathairn, Sayles may have discovered a new mix: opening to both
good notices and long lines.
   The movie may finally introduce the uninitiated to one of the
country's more independent-thinking directors and his reflections
on common people facing uncommon choices.
   Potential producers, however, were skeptical of ``Eight Men
Out.''
   ``A lot of the turndowns we got were people who said, `This is a
great story. You did a really good job on it. But we don't think we
can make money on this thing.'
   ``That's why a lot of good movies don't get made and continue
not to get made. The widest audience that you can go for is
probably the one that doesn't want any waves.''
   The major Hollywood studios told Sayles ``Eight Men Out'' was a
$15 million movie and didn't have ``the ooomph'' to make back the
money.
   ``And we'd say, `We can make it for $6 million or $7 million.
And finally they saw enough of the things that we had done that
looked more expensive than what they cost, they started to believe
us,'' he said.
   Told in straight-ahead style with authentic period detail, the
movie examines how personal and professional pressures seduced a
group of athletes to betray both the national pastime and the
national trust. Unlike ``The Natural,'' with its happy ending, this
is not a saccharine piece.
   Some of the players were motivated either by greed or fears of
hard-nosed gamblers who told them to throw the game _ or else.
Others were provoked by penny-pinching White Sox owner Charlie
Comiskey, who was so cheap he charged his players for washing their
uniforms. The team was called ``The Black Sox'' even before the
1919 series.
   ``The movie is about an exploitative situation,'' Sayles said.
``The owners were owners. You belonged to that guy.'' Some of the
White Sox, Sayles added, were paid half as much as equally talented
players on other teams.
   ``The day that they (the eight White Sox) were acquitted,
Comiskey said, `Well, I'm glad my boys are back.' And the day that
they were kicked out, which was literally the next day, he said,
`Well, good. Good riddance. Baseball doesn't need these guys. We'll
build from the ashes.'''
   Sayles wrote the script for ``Eight Men Out,'' based on Eliot
Asinof's book, 11 years ago as a screenwriting sample. Like much of
the work that followed, the script reflected Sayles' interest in
labor and class struggles.
   ``Eight Men Out'' was made only when Sayles and producers Sarah
Pillsbury and Midge Sanford (``River's Edge'') demonstrated a
remarkable ability for making expensive-looking movies on a
shoestring.
   Sayles plays journalist Ring Lardner in the movie. ``Every time
I can play a role that's one less person I don't have to worry
about: He's not going to give me any trouble,'' he said.
   He'll devote his time now to writing a TV movie about a
``low-rent lawyer'' and a feature film on the Spanish Civil War.
``And I want to go back and write a book that I've been working on
for a long time, a novel based on the Cuban community in Miami.''
   Sayles said his movies carry a variety of messages. ``Rarely is
it a message that you can put on a quilt: `Cleanliness is next to
godliness, so there,''' he said.
   ``With this movie, you should think about how people are
corrupted or lose their dreams without really knowing that's
happening. It should make you think about youth and innocence and
what's overrated about youth and innocence and what's actually
valuable about them _ and what we miss about them when they're
gone.''

   ``Chicago 19'' (Reprise) _ Chicago
   
   Chicago, the band, is approaching its 20th year in showbiz
firmly planted in the netherworld of ``adult contemporary'' music.
``Chicago 19,'' the latest offering by the former kings of Top 40,
gives a bad name to contemporary adults everywhere.
   A totally forgettable assortment of weak songs straining to be
anthems of love, the album has only one song _ the pretty ``We Can
Last Forever'' _ with any potential as a pop hit, something which
used to be Chicago's stock in trade.
   Lyrically, the songs fall into three general categories. There
are a few ``I've been hurt but I'll survive'' numbers, a couple of
``I know you've been hurt but I'll make things better'' tunes and a
some standard-issue whines about lost love.
   There are artists who can make out of such emotions music that
is tough, strong and moving. Then there are records such as
``Chicago 19,'' which take the same ingredients and ... spin around
about 33 times a minute.
   There are no satanic messages on ``Chicago 19,'' and no
endorsements of drug abuse. But this one really deserves a warning
label.

   ``The Indescribable Wow'' (Virgin) _ Sam Phillips
   
   Behind a shocking pink cover and even more ostentatious title is
an utterly charming record. Sam Phillips' ``The Indescribable Wow''
is a describable delight.
   As Leslie Phillips, she recorded several Christian albums before
turning to the pop music market. She decided to change her first
name, supposedly ignorant of the Sam Phillips who founded Sun
Records.
   The 26-year-old California native has a little-girl voice and a
knack for writing memorable melodies. With producer and boyfriend
T-Bone Burnett, she's crafted an inventive record rich with 1960s
influences.
   The wistful ``She Can't Tell Time'' sounds like an outtake from
the Beatles' ``Rubber Soul,'' while ``Remorse'' quotes liberally
from the Fab Four's ``She's a Woman.''
   Like most albums, ``The Indescribable Wow'' has its strong songs
and filler. But Phillips and Burnett save their most imaginative
arrangements for the weak songs, keeping boredom at bay.
   ``What Do I Do,'' for instance, is so slight it would probably
sound incomplete if strummed on an acoustic guitar. Burnett and
guest Van Dyke Parks turn it into a mini-operetta, with a full
orchestra and dreamy staggered vocals.
   ``Holding on to the Earth'' is sinister-sounding with a Farfisa
organ and what sounds like a sitar.
   Burnett is savvy enough to let the strong material stand almost
by itself. Phillips' voice is so seductive in ``I Don't Want to
Fall in Love'' that she won't be able to say the same for her
listeners. ``I Don't Know How to Say Goodbye to You'' and ``I Can't
Stop Crying'' are two other heartbreakers.
   Phillips and Burnett make a fine studio team, as any lover of
classic pop music will be able to attest.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Wendy Bagwell Still Can't Tune His Guitar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Irrepressible Wendy Bagwell has spent
more than a quarter century as a gospel music singer and humorist
and still has trouble tuning his well-traveled guitar.
   ``I still don't know how,'' Bagwell says in a cheerful burst of
self-deprecation.
   Moments before performing in Carnegie Hall 25 years ago, he had
to seek help to get his trusty guitar ready.
   ``I asked somebody in another group if it sounded like it was in
tune,'' he recalled. ``That tells you where I am as a musician.''
   Where he is as an entertainer is celebrating the 30th
anniversary of Wendy Bagwell and the Sunliters, one of gospel
music's most popular and enduring groups.
   ``It's been great,'' he said, alluding to sweet memories of
singing and cracking jokes in hot school auditoriums and small town
churches and dusty fairs since the late 1950s.
   ``If I wipe out this year, I can look up at the Lord and say
thanks for letting me make it with no talent.''
   The record indicates otherwise. The five-member group has
recorded 60 albums, toured Europe, sold several million records,
has a wall covered with awards and has made countless people laugh.
   Bagwell is best known for his record, ``Here Come the
Rattlesnakes,'' an amusing song based on a true story about the
time the Sunliters performed in a church near the Kentucky-West
Virginia line. Soon they discover church members getting rattlers
out of a box as part of the worship service.
   In the key line, the terrified Bagwell discovers there's no back
door.
   ``Where do they want one?'' he asks.
   The song is on the album ``This, That and the Other,'' which
continues to sell. Two million copies have been sold, an
extraordinary amount for gospel music.
   ``It got us off big orange drinks and weenies for a while to
come,'' Bagwell says.
   It also led to him being named comedian of the year by Record
World magazine. ``I didn't even know I WAS a comedian,'' he said.
   The Sunliters' concerts, held just about every weekend, are a
50-50 mix of music and humor.
   Some of the humor is inspired by the audience, such as when
someone gets up and walks toward the back.
   ``Don't write nothin' on the wall,'' Bagwell is fond of saying
to the red-faced person.
   Toward the end of the performance, the light touch is set aside
and veteran singer Jan (``little Jan'') Buckner tells about how,
when she was a baby, her mother was killed by a drunken driver.
   She recounts her time in orphanages and foster homes and then
the group performs the gospel song ``I Firmly Promise You.''
   ``The best compliment we get is from people who say they laughed
'til their stomach hurt and then they cried at the end of the
program,'' Bagwell said.
   Down through the years, Bagwell said, cautious record companies
have wanted him to tone down his humor. These days he refuses,
saying, ``People aren't all that starchy about things.''
   He's resisted offers to cross over into pop music, saying,
``We're blessed where we are. It's mighty good people we sing to.''
   The group rarely works seven straight days for a couple of
reasons. For one, they like to be home on Sunday to attend their
own church.
   ``I never wanted to wear people out,'' Bagwell adds. ``What's
that saying? `I love turnip greens, but not seven days a week.' ''
   He's been telling audiences for years that he's from Smyrna,
Ga., just outside Atlanta. That's not true.
   ``I really live in Hiram. It ain't on the way to nothin'. The
only way you'd come here is on purpose. There's no one-way streets
or red lights.''
   And still he struggles with his guitar.
   ``I played just three chords as a young man. Nowadays, with this
complicated stuff, there's songs I still can't find the chords to.''

<HEAD>The Artists: John Cheek, City Opera Benefit From Dental Check-up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Cheek was hired by the Metropolitan Opera
in 1977 after James Levine heard him praised often enough to
audition him. He was hired by the New York City Opera nine years
later, after Beverly Sills heard his voice in her dentist's office.
   It's more usual for an up-and-coming American opera singer to
move from the New York City Opera to the Met.
   But Cheek, this season, will sing at both places, to the
satisfaction of himself, the two opera companies and the public.
   How he came to be engaged by Miss Sills is an improbable story,
Cheek says, but it's the one she told him so he believes it.
   Visiting her dentist, she complained about the noise of the
drill. He handed her earphones and challenged her to guess who was
singing two of the devil's arias from ``Faust.'' She couldn't.
   Told it was John Cheek, whom she'd heard, but in roles not
requiring personality projection, she immediately called Cheek's
manager and said she was interested in him for ``Mefistofele.''
   This season at the New York City Opera, the 6-foot-3
bass-baritone will sing three evil title roles, in ``Mefistofele,''
``Attila'' and the premiere of ``Rasputin'' by Jay Reise.
   At the Met he'll be a nicer guy, singing the title role in ``The
Marriage of Figaro'' as well as Basilio, the music teacher, in
``The Barber of Seville'' and Colline, a philosopher, in ``La
Boheme.''
   Next season he'll sing his first ``Don Giovanni'' at the New
York City Opera and his first Wagner role, Gunther in
``Gotterdammerung,'' at the Met.
   Cheek's entry level at the Met wasn't the top. He says, ``My
second season, I had about 120 performances, almost a record. It
wasn't a question of being pushed vocally. My manager said my small
roles were `Dinner is served' and my large roles were `Dinner is
not served.'''
   The Met no longer is a place where singers like James McCracken
could only break out of tiny roles by going to Europe and coming
back a star. Cheek says, ``It's very much Levine's idea to take
young American singers, nurturing them there and allowing them to
move on to whatever their talents permit.''
   When Miss Sills offered him ``Mefistofele,'' which the Met
doesn't perform, Cheek asked for Levine's advice. ``He said it was
great, should be really good for me and I should go do it,'' Cheek
said.
   ``At the Met I was sort of getting into stand-up-and-sing parts
_ old men and priests. That's fine, but I wanted to do parts that
require a lot of acting and physical movement.''
   His biggest part at the Met so far is Figaro, who has a lot of
stage action as well as singing, and second biggest is Don Alfonso,
the old man in ``Cosi fan tutti.''
   He has sung the four villains in ``The Tales of Hoffmann'' in
Cincinnati and will sing them again in April in Pittsburgh.
   ``Mefistofele'' certainly fulfilled Cheek's desires for acting
and physical movement. ``The devil is the centerpiece of Frank
Corsaro's production. It's wonderful to sing such a powerful
character that just dominates the stage whenever he appears and
moves with demonic abandon.
   ``I've never done anything else needing that much stage
presence. He has to be this irresistible force. He's a loser; God
wins in the end. But he's a formidable opponent.
   ``Physically it's the most demanding part that I've ever done
and hopefully it will continue to be.''
   Cheek says if he didn't exercise on a machine that simulates
cross-country skiing, he doubts he'd have the strength or endurance
for ``Mefistofele.''
   ``The devil has a strange walk where I drag the top of my toes.
I wear a body stocking which makes me look snake-like, like I'm
stalking my prey. There's a throne about 10 feet high I climb on
and off the top of several times. That took quite a bit of getting
used to, particularly since I'm not fond of heights. The first
rehearsal was a disaster. I couldn't breathe or sing.
   ``The thing that bothers me the most now is that the throne
tends to rattle and shake a bit. That can be real unnerving.''
   Cheek isn't sure he overcame his fear of heights but his
motivation is sufficient to send him scrambling up the throne,
saving enough breath to sing. ``I'm willing to try almost
anything,'' he said.
   The singer was born in Greenville, S.C. His parents, who taught
Spanish and French, moved the family to North Carolina when he was
6 months old. He and his brother grew up in Wilmington, N.C.
   His wife, Lee Young, studies singing and works in massage
therapy. Cheek says, ``She is very good. She went to Japan with me
on the tour and was kept very busy. Singing can be very stressful.
The difficult thing is to get the right muscles working and the
ones that aren't supposed to be working relaxed.''
   His career so far has been mainly with American opera companies
and orchestras. He has sung Walter in ``Luisa Miller'' at the Paris
Opera and still another devil, in ``The Damnation of Faust,'' in
Berlin. He notes that most opera records are made in Europe, using
singers who are known there, and he'd like to be part of that scene.
   It's all right with Cheek that his repertoire is different at
the Met and New York City Opera. ``I get bored with doing one thing
all the time. If I had to rehash five or six roles, I think very
quickly I would lose enthusiasm and I'm sure the performances would
reflect that. I've seen it happen. That takes the joy out of it.
It's just not worth it unless you have that.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Carly Simon Keeps Busy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Newly wed and busy in her career as singer and
composer, Carly Simon dreams of having a little house in the
suburbs.
   ``How I picture it is a little stone house, with maybe two or
three bedrooms, tiny, though,'' she said. ``I'll do all the
housework myself. With a nice living room with fireplace and a cozy
kitchen.
   ``It doesn't need to have a lot of ground but it needs to have
trailing vines, wisteria or honeysuckle, and definitely a magnolia
tree if possible. That's what I want to escape to on weekends from
the city.''
   This is not, however, a woman looking forward to retirement. She
had a new album out in August, which was taped during her first
concert performance in eight years.
   She's also scoring a movie for Mike Nichols that will include a
love theme she wrote for her new husband, Jim Hart. And she has
done two private concerts which were her contribution to a benefit
auction on Martha's Vineyard.
   The Arista Records album, ``Carly Simon's Greatest Hits Live,''
was taped _ and so was a Home Box Office special _ at one of two
concerts on a Martha's Vineyard beach.
   ``I was promoting the `Coming Around Again' album, which came
out in April 1987; consequently there are many songs on the live
album that also are on that album. I also did `You're So Vain,'
`Loving You Is the Right Thing To Do' and `Nobody Does It Better.'
I didn't do `Jesse,' `That's the Way It Should Be' and `Haven't Got
Time for the Pain.'''
   Simon talked about her life and work in her Manhattan apartment,
where winter coats hung from a row of hooks in the entryway.
   About the live album, she said, ``My favorites are songs that
never really got exposure and I wanted to give a second life, like
`Never Been Gone,' which is my favorite song on the album, and `It
Happens Every Day.'
   ``It's funny how certain songs that I've written I always
thought were terrific songs but they were never picked up from
albums as singles or they were on albums that were flops or they
were never recorded properly.
   ``I think `It Happens Every Day' is such a neat song, compact,
concise, emotional. It was on `Hello Big Man,' an album I did for
Warner Brothers, which was never particularly popular. I think it's
one of my best albums. It was at a time Warner Brothers was
thinking of sending me to Siberia. I don't think they invested a
whole lot in promoting that album. They wanted me to do more things
that were contemporary.
   ``They certainly didn't want me to record `Torch,' which was an
album of standards, before Linda Ronstadt did her album of
standards. They didn't want to release it, finally did release it
and it has gone gold.''
   The curse of the recording industry, she said, is radio's top 40
playlists. ``It kills your artistic motivation,'' she said, but
credited Arista Records president Clive Davis for helping to keep
her going.
   ``You really can't sell albums in record stores that don't have
some outlet on radio. Clive says, `You have to be yourself but you
also have to give me something that I can sell to radio.'
   ``I don't know if I consider myself an artist, so let's call me
a musician with an identity and a path. I've got somewhere that I'm
going to. I'm not going to do the same kinds of songs now that I
did eight years ago. A good businessman, if he has a musician who's
in it for the long haul, will let him or her do what he or she
wants to do, with a certain amount of gentle guidance toward the
revolting top 40 playlist.''
   Carly Simon became Mrs. Jim Hart on Dec. 23. The couple met on a
train in upstate New York in May 1987.
   ``He was an insurance salesman. He said saying that got rid of a
lot of people at cocktail parties,'' she said.
   ``He riveted me. I was just fascinated. It didn't matter what he
did. I'd never gone out with a man who had a straight job before.
I'm used to artists and musicians. He thought I was one of those
female singers but he wasn't sure which one. He wasn't into popular
music at all.''
   Hart, who had already begun a novel, quit his job and moved to
Martha's Vineyard with Simon. ``He's an incredible poet and his
novel is just so exciting,'' she said. ``I read it at every stage.''
   Simon avoids stage performances because of claustrophobia, which
also bothers her on airplanes and subways.
   ``It probably stems from a childhood stammer,'' she said. ``I
was always afraid of being humiliated by having to talk in public.
I've worked very hard many, many years to try to rid myself of it.
   ``On a stage I feel trapped by the lights, as if I can't get
off. Then I panic. Outside (last summer) it was a lot better. I
felt there was more air for me to breathe and I felt less trapped.''
   She also performed two mini-concerts this summer, after offering
her services at the Martha's Vineyard Community Services auction.
   ``The highest they ever went before was $4,000 for a sail on
Walter Cronkite's yacht with Walter Cronkite,'' she said.
   When the bidding got to $11,000 for her concert she suggested
that both bidders pay and she would sing two songs at each house.
One wanted an exclusive so bidding went on up and up, until the two
bidders agreed to three songs each.
   ``Jim was going to stand up and say, `What? Only $52,000 for my
wife!''' In September the couple returns to Manhattan, where her
son, Ben, will go to school. Daughter Sarah will go to a boarding
school in Massachusetts. Both children are from her marriage to
singer-songwriter James Taylor.
   Hart has an 11-year-old son who lives in Ithaca, N.Y., with his
mother and stepfather.

   Videos reviewed this week: ``Zelly and Me,'' ``The Milagro
Beanfield War''
   
   ``Zelly and Me'' (RCA-Columbia Home Video; VHS-Beta, $79.95;
Rated PG)
   
   ``Zelly and Me'' is a woman's movie _ with a female
writer-director and a cast that only briefly and peripherally
includes men _ that should appeal to men and women. It shows the
ties that bind two women to a girl and the pain they can cause each
other.
   Zelly (Isabella Rossellini) is governess to an orphan (Alexandra
Johnes) who lives on a Virginia estate in 1958 with her wealthy
grandmother, Co-Co, (Glynis Johns), a lonely, possessive woman
unable to ask for love or give it freely.
   Rossellini is beautiful and touching as Zelly, a gentle, loving
woman far from the brooding, frightened character she played in
``Blue Velvet.'' Zelly and Phoebe have a sweet, nurturing
relationship; Co-Co is unpredictable, from doting to devilish.
   Tina Rathbone's 1988 movie is very pretty, as Zelly and Phoebe
frolic in the gardens, put on a wedding for two stuffed animals or
share their fascination with the legend of Joan of Arc. Into this
idyllic life comes Co-Co, who destroys her granddaughter's
playthings and tries to estrange Zelly and Phoebe as she lashes out
from her jealousy and isolation.
   The film successfully, and occasionally too cloyingly, puts
viewers into the life of this pretty, vulnerable child. The climax
comes with the opportunity for Zelly and Phoebe to escape Co-Co,
and the resolution is satisfying and realistic.

   ``The Milagro Beanfield War'' (MCA Home Video; VHS-Beta, $89.95;
Rated R)
   
   An aging angel in a sombrero watches over Milagro, N.M., and
it's a good thing, too: The evil land developers have come to town,
and they're none too happy about the handyman who's decided to
water his beanfield at their expense.
   In this Tex-mex version of the David and Goliath story, set in
the stunning New Mexico high desert and directed by Robert Redford,
what starts as accidental irrigation becomes a cause celebre in the
sleepy village of Milagro, where little has changed for 300 years.
   As the beanfield grows, so does the community's social
consciousness. Support for the old ways and resistance to the
threat posed by the new resort surge to the point where even the
developer's hatchet man, played by a stone-faced Christopher
Walken, can do little to keep the townsfolk in line.
   This is a funny, feel-good film with plenty of good
performances, particularly from Ruben Blades as the laconic
sheriff, Sonia Braga as the revolutionary garage owner, Ruby, and
Carlos Riquelme as the elderly Amarante, who pampers his pet pig
and carries on frequent friendly arguments with Milagro's guardian
angel (Robert Carricart). The pig is good, too.
   Ignore the ``R'' rating, which is inexplicable; there is no sex
or gore and little foul language. This is a sweet family picture
that will leave everybody feeling warm and gooey as a chocolate bar
on an Albuquerque afternoon.

   To save Ethel St. Lawrence from the aneurysm
pressing on her brain, doctors ``killed'' her for 40 minutes. They
put her in a coma, stopped her heart, chilled her by 40 degrees and
drained her body of blood.
   St. Lawrence was back at work 10 weeks after what she calls ``a
cotton-pickin' miracle,'' a sort of suspended animation that lets
surgeons cure hard-to-reach, high-risk aneurysms that once were
considered inoperable.
   ``It is everything that technology can possibly offer,'' said
her neurosurgeon, Dr. Robert Spetzler at Barrow Neurological
Institute in Phoenix.
   ``It may be the surgery of the future in cases where bleeding
poses the greatest risk to the operation,'' said Dr. Julian E.
Bailes, a neurosurgeon at Allegheny General Hospital here who
studied with Spetzler. ``That's the biggest cause of death in
surgery. If you could put someone in a state of suspended
animation, you could operate in a totally bloodless field.''
   In a severely cold, bloodless state, the brain can be deprived
of oxygen up to 55 minutes, giving surgeons time to remove the
aneurysm _ a bubble caused by weakness in the wall of a blood
vessel _ and clip arteries feeding it without the danger of massive
bleeding and certain death.
   Of 15 patients who have undergone the procedure at Barrow, one
has died, Bailes said. Most had ``excellent'' results, a few
reported some weakness but otherwise did well, and most remained in
a coma no more than five days.
   ``It's getting through the surgery,'' said Dr. Steven Shedd, a
Barrow neuroanesthesiologist who worked on St. Lawrence. ``If
you've tolerated the procedure and you wake up, you're going to be
OK.''
   But the risks, including that the heart won't restart, are too
great to use the procedure where normal anesthesia can adequately
do the job.
   ``It's what Birdseye discovered. It you freeze a fresh fish it
will come back and you can use it. The problem is, some people
don't,'' said Dr. Louis Caplan of Boston's New England Medical
Center and chairman of the American Heart Association's Stroke
Council.
   And because the patient has to be taken to the point of clinical
death for the operation to succeed, doctors approach it with ``a
lot of respect,'' said Shedd. ``Every time I do one of these I get
very nervous.
   ``You're taking a patient that's alive and breathing and
stopping their hearts and putting them into this state. They are
nothing. There is no breathing, no heart function. The brain
function is nil. We tilt the table up and drain all the blood into
the pump.
   ``I don't want to say the word `dead,' but the patient is
definitely suspended at that point. Cellular activity is still
occurring, but at a rate so low that we can't detect it. They're
not doing anything. We're talking cold.''
   St. Lawrence, a 61-year-old Phoenix secretary, was rushed to
Barrow on June 2, suffering from a severe two-day headache and
unable to open her right eye. Tests showed that a sinus aneurysm
detected four years ago had grown.
   Partly because of heavy doses of barbiturates given before
surgery to help prevent stroke or brain damage, St. Lawrence
recalls nothing about the June 6 operation. But she does recall
experiencing a very strong sensation.
   ``I just had this immense feeling that I was being cared for. It
felt like somebody was just holding me in their arms and taking
care of me and that I would be OK. It was just a feeling of peace.''
   Four months after surgery, she needs no medication and the
severe headaches are gone, though she still is unable to fully open
her eye.
   ``It's just a cotton-pickin' miracle. It truly is. They do say
God works in mysterious ways, and one of his ways of working is to
have capable people who know how to do things, and in this case
extremely capable surgeons.''
   Bailes is confounded, though, by Cecilia Duffy, a 76-year-old
Pittsburgh woman who spent 51 minutes in suspended animation Aug.
31 while surgeons removed an egg-sized aneurysm that had almost
completely disabled her.
   Duffy hasn't come out of the drug-induced coma, even though her
brain activity is improving, there is no evidence of brain injury,
and she moves her legs when stimulated. ``Quite frankly, I'm
worried about her because I would have thought she would have come
out of it by now,'' Bailes said.
   ``It's hard to know why (she hasn't) because she's old and her
liver isn't working that well,'' he said. ``She's not breaking down
drugs that quickly, so that's made it a little more confusing...
   ``As we go longer it's more likely she will have suffered some
stroke, some sort of (brain) injury.''
   Cooling the body and stopping the heart before an operation was
pioneered decades ago by cardiac surgeons, particularly in children
where there is little room to maneuver and bleeding is difficult to
control, said Dr. George Magovern Jr., a heart transplant surgeon
at Allegheny General who worked on Duffy.
   ``Hypothermia is an intricate part of cardiac surgery,
particularly moderate hypothermia'' in which the body is cooled 20
to 30 degrees, Magovern said. Profound hypothermia, in which the
temperature is lowered 40 degrees, ``is not done frequently, but
it's done enough.''
   To achieve hypothermia, doctors lower the operating room
temperature to about 55 and wrap the patient in cooling blankets.
They remove several pints of blood and replace them with
refrigerator-cold saline solution. A heat exchanger _ like a
radiator _ then runs the saline-blood mixture through ice and back
into the body. When the body is cold enough, the blood is removed
entirely.
   ``It's quicker and more efficient to repair the heart in a
bloodless field, and sometimes the only way you can accomplish that
is with profound hypothermia,'' Magovern said. ``But the downside
is that it limits you to 55 minutes of surgery, and there's always
the potential for neurological injury.''
   The difficulty in applying it to brain surgery, said Caplan, is
that doctors ``don't have a good way to monitor the person to see
how the brain's working. If you purposely put them in a coma and
decrease temperature and blood pressure, you have no way of knowing
if there's been damage until later.''
   ``It's an extreme way of doing an operation that requires
extreme measures,'' said Dr. Arthur Day of the University of
Florida at Gainesville and chairman of the cerebral vascular
department of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons.
   ``The side effects are quite subtantial potentially,'' Day said.
``So it's not an operation technique that we do for the
run-of-the-mill aneurysm. But for certain uncommon ones it may be
the only way.
   ``The problem is, what would you be like if you didn't have the
surgery? Most of the time having the aneurysm is such a bad thing
that you're willing to take a much greater risk.''

<HEAD>Augustine Research May Provide Valuable Information</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL JENKINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTINE VOLCANO, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Working from a plywood shack
and a collection of tents perched on the flank of Augustine
Volcano, researchers are setting up a high-tech system to measure
the volcano's shudders to within an inch.
   When they're done, scientists using briefcase-sized laser
instruments ``could detect less than that, but it's a matter of
whether you believe it,'' says Gene Iwatsubo of the U.S. Geological
Survey, one of the researchers trying to puzzle out how the volcano
works and whether its eruptions can be predicted.
   ``The thrust of the research is to try to find precursors, signs
of eruption,'' says Juergen Kienle, a University of Alaska
geophysics professor. ``The more precursors you have, the better
off you are.''
   Augustine Volcano juts 4,000 feet out of Kamishak Bay on the
west side of Cook Inlet. It appears benign but there have been six
major eruptions since its discovery in 1778. One, in 1883,
triggered a 30-foot wave that destroyed houses and boats at Port
Graham, nearly 50 miles away.
   Computer models show a slide-generated tsunami would reach
Homer, a Kachemak Bay fishing community of 4,000 people about 70
miles away, in about an hour. A smaller wave would reach Anchorage,
175 miles away, three hours later.
   ``We can't assess the probability of a slide occurring,'' says
state seismologist John Davies. ``All we're saying is there is a
possiblity. We have no way to calculate the likelihood. But if we
can't calculate the possibility, we feel it's best to monitor it.''
   Information that may enable scientists to predict eruptions
accurately at Augustine may be of great value to other parts of the
world where millions of people live in the shadows of volcanoes _
or on them.
   ``If you tell a mayor there is a 5 percent chance his town will
be wiped out, it's hard for him to take action,'' Davies says. ``If
you tell him there's a 75 percent chance his town is going to be
wiped out, he can act.''
   Kienle and seven researchers from the University of Alaska
Geophysical Institute and USGS have been pounding in benchmarks and
performing surveys and gas studies, a $100,000 effort by the
state-federal cooperative Alaska Volcano Observatory formed this
year. A magnetic study also is planned.
   ``This is really an uncomplicated volcano,'' Kienle says. ``This
one is really easy to deal with. It's very beautiful. Very active.''
   Augustine, the most active of some 60 volcanoes in the Aleutian
Arc, erupted in 1812, 1883, 1935, 1964, 1976 and 1986, when it
spewed ash over much of south-central Alaska, disrupting air
traffic.
   Seismographs sensitive enough to detect passing planes, nearby
boats and high winds were placed on the volcano in 1970. Their
tracings on machines in Fairbanks mapped the 1976 eruption, and the
eight months of seismic activity before the eruption 10 years later.
   In January and February of 1986, scientists began briefing the
Air Force, Federal Aviation Administration and state Division of
Emergency Services about a possible eruption. Early March 26, the
seismographs showed earthquakes at the rate of about 50 per day.
Within hours, the rate to 500, then 5,000. Augustine blew its top
the next day.
   ``It's a constant process of becoming better at forecasting when
the volcano will become active,'' Kienle says. ``We are getting
better. We will continue to get better.''
   Four seismographs ring the volcano at an elevation of about
1,000 feet and two are near the peak. Three sets of tiltmeters
measure changes in the surface.
   ``One of the things we're discovering is that most volcanoes
have their own uniqueness,'' Davies says. ``Not every detail that
one learns at one volcano is applicable to another. It's the
hopeful assumption that you can apply it elsewhere. I don't think
it is a long-shot hope. I think it's likely.
   ``The value is obvious. ''

<HEAD>Restorers Tackle Massive Great Pyramid for First Time</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIMI MANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GIZA PLATEAU, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Great Pyramid of Cheops, pocked
by thousands of years of vandalism and stone-robbing, is finally
getting a facelift.
   The effort to clean rubbish from between the massive limestone
blocks and to tighten loose rocks marks the first restoration work
ever attempted on the outside of the sole survivor of the ancient
world's Seven Wonders.
   ``This is not just cosmetic work,'' said Zahi Hawass, the
Egyptian Antiquities Organization's director-general for the
pyramids area. ``We're afraid unless we do something to stabilize
the outer stones, there could be a tragedy.
   ``People have a tendency to think that pyramids will be here
forever because they're so massive, but each is suffering from wind
and sand erosion, rain and salt (and) ... to a great extent because
of the hands of man.''
   Work began inside the Great Pyramid last winter to remove salt
that oozed through the limestone and accumulated along passageway
walls. The work on the outside began in late August.
   From a distance, the pyramid appears fine. Close up, it's
obviously far from healthy. Many of the massive blocks, weighing an
average 2{ tons, have eroded or disappeared. Others hang
precariously on uneven ledges.
   In 1976, a stone weighing several tons fell from the southern
side. No one was injured because tourists were being kept away
during a dignitary's visit, Hawass said. ``We chose to begin
(restoration) with Cheops Pyramid first, because we know there's a
chance more stones will fall.''
   When put in place 4,600 years ago, the estimated 2.3 million
blocks were assembled with such skill that only a thin sheet of
paper would pass between.
   The new project aims at duplicating such precision. Workers
skilled in climbing scurry over the rocks, binding loose stones
with natural mortar like that used by the ancients and repairing
damage caused by millenia of nesting birds, desert animals and
human ravagers.
   Historical records and legends indicate the first man-made
damage occurred as early as 500 years after the death of Cheops,
the second pharaoh of ancient Egypt's Fourth Dynasty. The Egyptians
were in revolt against tyrannical and oppressive practices of the
past, hacking and destroying statues and monuments from the earlier
days of the pharaohs.
   Less than a century later, the 12th-dynasty Pharoah Amenemhet
took many stones from Cheops' pyramid complex to build one for
himself at el-Lisht, south of Giza Plateau. Teams from New York's
Metropolitan Museum, who excavated Amenemhet's pyramid, found
hundreds of the decorated pieces.
   Nobody knows when or why, but the Great Pyramid at some time
lost 30 feet of height, leaving it still enormous at almost 453
feet. Its outer surface originally was covered with a protective
layer of fine, hard limestone, only traces of which survived
desecration and looting.
   Thousands of its stones were stolen over time, but the pyramid
remained structurally intact until the late ninth century, writes
I.E.S. Edwards, the British Egyptologist acknowledged as the
authority on Egyptian pyramids.
   At that time, Arab raiders broke a large hole just below the
main entrance and entered the monument in a vain search for
treasure, Edwards wrote in his showpiece work ``The Pyramids of
Egypt.''
   ``Subsequently it became a copious and convenient quarry,
providing the stone required for bridges over irrigation canals,
houses, walls and other buildings in the neighborhood of Giza and
Cairo,'' he wrote.
   In the early 19th century, the Albanian Mohammed Ali, credited
with creating the modern Egyptian state as part of the Ottoman
Empire, thought nothing of using blocks from Cheops and other
pyramids for construction.
   The English Egyptologist Flinders Petrie wrote in the 1880s of
watching as a steady stream of camels, hundreds daily, carried
massive blocks into Cairo from nearby Abu Rawash pyramid, built by
Cheops' successor Djedefre.
   Today the pyramid area is littered with toppled building blocks.

<HEAD>Suspended Animation Charting New Medical Frontiers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To save Ethel St. Lawrence from the aneurysm
pressing on her brain, doctors ``killed'' her for 40 minutes. They
put her in a coma, stopped her heart, chilled her by 40 degrees and
drained her body of blood.
   St. Lawrence was back at work 10 weeks after what she calls ``a
cotton-pickin' miracle,'' a sort of suspended animation that lets
surgeons cure hard-to-reach, high-risk aneurysms that once were
considered inoperable.
   ``It is everything that technology can possibly offer,'' said
her neurosurgeon, Dr. Robert Spetzler at Barrow Neurological
Institute in Phoenix.
   ``It may be the surgery of the future in cases where bleeding
poses the greatest risk to the operation,'' said Dr. Julian E.
Bailes, a neurosurgeon at Allegheny General Hospital here who
studied with Spetzler. ``That's the biggest cause of death in
surgery. If you could put someone in a state of suspended
animation, you could operate in a totally bloodless field.''
   In a severely cold, bloodless state, the brain can be deprived
of oxygen up to 55 minutes, giving surgeons time to remove the
aneurysm _ a bubble caused by weakness in the wall of a blood
vessel _ and clip arteries feeding it without the danger of massive
bleeding and certain death.
   Of 15 patients who have undergone the procedure at Barrow, only
one has died, Bailes said. Most had ``excellent'' results, a few
reported some weakness but otherwise did well, and most remained in
a coma no more than five days.
   But the risks, including that the heart won't restart, are too
great to use the procedure where normal anesthesia can adequately
do the job.
   And because the patient has to be taken to the point of clinical
death for the operation to succeed, doctors approach it with ``a
lot of respect,'' said Dr. Steven Shedd, a Barrow
neuroanesthesiologist who worked on St. Lawrence.
   St. Lawrence, a 61-year-old Phoenix secretary, had surgery June
6. She now needs no medication and the severe headaches are gone,
though she still is unable to fully open her eye.
   Cecilia Duffy, a 76-year-old Pittsburgh woman, hasn't come out
of the coma induced Aug. 31 to remove an aneurysm. Her brain
activity is improving, there is no evidence of brain injury, and
she moves her legs when stimulated, but doctors don't know why she
doesn't wake up.

<HEAD>Augustine Research May Provide Valuable Information</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTINE VOLCANO, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Working from a plywood shack
and tents perched on the flank of Augustine Volcano, researchers
are setting up a high-tech system to measure the volcano's shudders
to within an inch.
   When they're done, scientists using briefcase-sized laser
instruments ``could detect less than that, but it's a matter of
whether you believe it,'' says Gene Iwatsubo of the U.S. Geological
Survey, one of the researchers trying to puzzle out how the volcano
works and whether its eruptions can be predicted.
   ``The thrust of the research is to try to find precursors, signs
of eruption,'' says Juergen Kienle, a University of Alaska
geophysics professor. ``The more precursors you have, the better
off you are.''
   Augustine Volcano juts 4,000 feet out of Kamishak Bay on the
west side of Cook Inlet. It appears benign but there have been six
major eruptions since its discovery in 1778. One, in 1883,
triggered a 30-foot wave that destroyed houses and boats at Port
Graham, nearly 50 miles away.
   Computer models show a slide-generated tsunami would reach
Homer, a Kachemak Bay fishing community of 4,000 people about 70
miles away, in about an hour. A smaller wave would reach Anchorage,
175 miles away, three hours later.
   Information that may enable scientists to predict eruptions
accurately at Augustine may be of great value to other parts of the
world where millions of people live in the shadows of volcanoes _
or on them.
   Four seismographs ring the volcano at an elevation of about
1,000 feet and two are near the peak. Three sets of tiltmeters
measure changes in the surface.

<HEAD>Restorers Tackle Massive Great Pyramid for First Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GIZA PLATEAU, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Great Pyramid of Cheops, pocked
by thousands of years of vandalism and stone-robbing, is finally
getting a facelift.
   The effort to clean rubbish from between the massive limestone
blocks and to tighten loose rocks marks the first restoration work
ever attempted on the outside of the sole survivor of the ancient
world's Seven Wonders.
   ``This is not just cosmetic work,'' said Zahi Hawass, Egyptian
Antiquities Organization director-general for the pyramids area.
``We're afraid unless we do something to stabilize the outer
stones, there could be a tragedy.''
   Work began inside the Great Pyramid last winter to remove salt
that oozed through the limestone onto inside walls. The outside
work began last month.
   From a distance, the pyramid appears fine. Close up, it's
obviously far from healthy. Many of the massive blocks, weighing an
average 2{ tons, have eroded or disappeared. Others hang
precariously on uneven ledges.
   In 1976, a stone weighing several tons fell from the southern
side. No one was injured because tourists were being kept away
during a dignitary's visit, Hawass said. ``We chose to begin
(restoration) with Cheops Pyramid first, because we know there's a
chance more stones will fall.''
   When put in place 4,600 years ago, the estimated 2.3 million
blocks were assembled with such skill that only a thin sheet of
paper would pass between.
   The new project aims at duplicating such precision. Workers
skilled in climbing scurry over the rocks, binding loose stones
with natural mortar like that used by the ancients and repairing
damage caused by millenia of nesting birds, desert animals and
human ravagers.

   For the first time since the 1970s, automakers
are back in the business of making cars and trucks with a
vengeance, and their offerings for 1989 show it.
   Performance, handling, and wind-cheating styling are required
just to get into the game.
   For 1989, engines are fuel-injected, turbocharged, supercharged,
multivalved or just plain bigger and faster. Many cars have
anti-lock braking, a computerized system that prevents lockup;
advanced suspension systems aimed at a variety of driving tastes;
more responsive four-speed automatic transmissions and styling that
makes the large and small econoboxes of the early 1980s nothing
more than a bad memory.
   Buyers looking for plain, basic transportation can still find
it. But for 1989, the pure pleasure of driving is once again a key
factor in the automotive equation.
   Here are highlights of what's new for 1989:
   GENERAL MOTORS=
   CHEVROLET: Chevy's imports _ the Suzuki-made Sprint minicar,
Isuzu-built Spectrum subcompact and Toyota-GM Nova, along with the
new Suzuki Tracker sport-utility vehicle _ will be sold under the
lineup name Geo at Chevrolet dealerships beginning in 1989. Geo is
the result of Chevy's various attempts to sell imports to buyers
who don't usually shop its dealers. For 1989, the three-cylinder,
50 mpg Sprint becomes the Metro and the Toyota Corolla-based Nova
becomes the Prizm.
   During 1989, Chevrolet will get its first member of the GM-10
midsize car family, a four-door called Lumina. Chevrolet's midsize
Corsica sedan, introduced as a 1988 model, gets a hatch-back
version with fold-down rear seat for 1989. Another option, the LTZ
touring sedan, has a 130-horsepower, 2.8-liter V6 engine and sport
suspension.
   The Cavalier subcompact will be the first car with GM's
so-called ``self-aligning'' steering wheel, which sits on legs that
collapse on impact, flattening the wheel against the driver's torso
to evenly distribute impact force and reduce chest injuries.
   The big 22-year-old, rear-drive 1989 Caprice full-size sedan
comes with a 5.0-liter V8 engine and air conditioning.
   For 1989, Chevy's Corvette sports car gets the most powerful
small-block V8 ever at 5.7 liters, a six-speed manual transmission,
bigger wheels and, on the Z51 performance model, adjustable
suspension. Convertibles will get an optional removable hard-top.
   Like most of its competitors, Chevy's compact S-10 pickup trucks
and Blazer sport-utility vehicles come with standard rear anti-lock
brakes for 1989. Big 4.3-liter, V6 engines are offered on both.
Chevy full-size pickups and Astro rear-wheel-drive compact van also
get rear anti-lock brakes.
   PONTIAC: The Grand Prix coupe, Pontiac's GM10 model, starts the
model year with a 2.8-liter V6 engine, upgraded to a 3.1-liter
engine later in 1989. Air conditioning is standard. Also later,
Pontiac will offer a limited-edition McLaren Turbo Grand Prix, with
a turbocharged 3.1-liter engine and automatic transmission and
anti-lock brakes, both standard.
   Anti-lock brakes also are available on the Pontiac Bonneville
sedan, which has GM's 3.8-liter, 165-horsepower V6 engine on all
versions.
   Pontiac's Grand Am, its best-selling model, is slightly restyled
for 1989. Engine choices, all four-cylinder, include a 2.5-liter, a
turbo-charged 2.0-liter and a 16-valve 2.3-liter.
   For 1989, the 20th anniversary for the Trans Am sports coupe,
Pontiac is offering a limited edition with a turbo 3.8-liter,
250-horsepower engine, automatic four-speed transmission and white
exterior.
   OLDSMOBILE: In mid-1989, Oldsmobile's GM10, the Cutlass Supreme,
also gets the 3.1-liter V6 engine. Anti-lock brakes are standard on
the Trofeo coupe and Touring Sedan and optional on Toronado,
Ninety-Eight and Cutlass Supreme. Oldsmoile also offers
International Series versions of Cutlass Cierra and Cutlass Supreme
and Cutlass Calais, more powerful engines than the base models,
computerized driver information systems and, on the Supreme, a
compact-disc player.
   BUICK: Buick's Riviera coupe and midsize Century are restyled
and Riviera is longer and more graceful. Century gets an optional
3.8-liter V6 engine. Later in the year, Buick moves further upscale
with the Park Avenue Ultra. Ultra will have an all-leather interior
and power front seats. Regal, Buick's GM10, shares the 3.1-liter
engine with its sisters at mid-year and an optional CD player. All
Buick models will have Dynaride suspension, which Buick says is
more responsive while still offering a smooth boulevard ride.
   CADILLAC: ``Bigger is better'' is the motto of GM's luxury-car
division, which has lengthened both the Fleetwood and DeVille for
1989. Allante, the nearly $60,000, Italian-bodied convertible
coupe, has a more powerful 4.5-liter V8 engine, shared with the
rest of the lineup. Allante also has sportier handling and larger
wheels with a self-adjusting suspension system. Other goodies
include a rapid-melt windshield option, personalized remote entry
system and a rear-view mirror that automatically adjusts itself to
glare from other vehicles' headlights.
   FORD=
   FORD: The big news is the sleeker, lower all-new Thunderbird
midsize coupe. The 1989 image model is the Thunderbird Super Coupe,
replacing last year's Turbo Coupe. The Super Coupe is
super-charged, a mechanical system that unlike turbo-charging gives
the engine extra boost at all times rather than only after reaching
highway speed. It also has big, easy-to-read, black-and-white
analog dashboard gauges. The 1989 T-bird has four-wheel independent
suspension, automatic adjustable suspension and a 3.8-liter V6
engine. Options include anti-lock brakes and a compact disc player.

   Ford introduced another 1989 model, the Mazda-engineered and
Mazda-built Ford Probe, in May. The two-door hatchback has a
standard three-valve-per-cylinder, four-cylinder 2.2-liter engine
with an optional turbo-charged 2.2-liter GT version. Transmission
is five-speed manual or four-speed automatic. The GT also has
automatic adjustable suspension, fog lamps and optional anti-lock
brakes and CD player. This reasonably priced car has been sold out
for months and Mazda is squeezing all it can from its Flat Rock
assembly plant.
   Ford also will offer a high-performance version of its Taurus
midsize sedan later in the year. The Taurus SHO _ for Super High
Output _ will have a 24-valve, 3.0-liter, 220-horsepower
fuel-injected V6 engine developed by Ford and Yamaha, five-speed
manual transmission, standard air conditioning and other touches.
   Ford has restyled its Ranger compact pickup and Bronco II
compact sport-utility vehicle for 1989. Both get standard rear
anti-lock brakes and a new 2.3-liter dual-spark plug engine.
   LINCOLN-MERCURY: The 1989 Mercury Cougar shares all features of
the Thunderbird, and like the Super Coupe, the high-performance
Cougar XR7 is supercharged. The 1989 Lincoln Continental luxury
sedan will be the first domestic-made car with airbags on both the
driver and passenger side. The '89 Lincoln Mark VII coupe has a
5.0-liter, 225-horsepower V8, anti-lock brakes and keyless entry
system.
   CHRYSLER=
   CHRYSLER-PLYMOUTH: After nearly a decade, Chrysler is replacing
its venerable, stodgy, fuel-efficient front-wheel-drive K-car with
the more updated Plymouth Acclaim. Acclaim is a roomy, if sparse,
four-door family sedan with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder base engine
and optional 2.5-liter turbo or 3.0-liter V6 with four-speed
automatic transmission. Acclaim's styling is smoother and more
rounded than the K-cars but still conservative. Its suspension
includes gas struts and provides increased control and comfort.
   Chrysler also adds an optional turbo-charged four-cylinder
engine for is Voyager minivan along with the existing optional V6
by Mitsubishi.
   Plymouth's Mitsubishi import, the Colt, is completely restyled
for increased aerodynamics. The two-door Colt hatchback has an
optional turbo-charged engine.
   Plymouth also will get a sporty, Probe-fighting Laser subcompact
coupe during 1989. Laser will be made at Diamond-Star, a joint
venture between Chrysler and Mitsubishi.
   DODGE: Dodge's version of the Acclaim is the Spirit. Dodge also
shares the Colt and sells it under the same name. Like Voyager, the
Caravan minivan gets an optional turbo engine. Most Dodge trucks
get standard rear anti-lock brakes. A new 5.9-liter, in-line
6-cylinder Cummins diesel engine is optional on many 1989 full-size
Ram trucks. The Mitsubishi-built Raider sport-utility vehicle gets
an optional six-cylinder engine. The Dakota midsize truck also gets
a more powerful engine for 1989.
   JEEP-EAGLE: The Mitsubishi-built Summit sedan (a version of the
Mitsubishi Mirage) joins the Eagle lineup. For 1989, Jeep Cherokee
and Wagoneer have optional four-wheel anti-lock brakes, while
Wrangler comes in a new Islander version that offers bright new
colors and a 2.5-liter four-cylinder or 4.2-liter six-cylinder
engine. Jeep-Eagle also will get a version of the Plymouth Laser,
possibly in 1989.
   NISSAN: Two new models will allow Nissan to re-enter the
competition. The rear-wheel-drive 240SX sports coupe has a
multi-valve four-cylinder engine and comes in notchback and
fastback versions. The upscale Maxima sedan gets a V6 engine and a
Nissan-Bose sound system, optional on some versions. Both offer
options including heads-up display, which projects critical
dashboard information such as speed onto the windshield so the
driver doesn't have to refocus by looking from the road to the
gauges.
   MAZDA: 1989 offerings include a rear-wheel-drive minivan.
   MITSUBISHI: Chrysler's Japanese partner will sell two all-new
products through its own dealerships. The 1989 Mirage is a
subcompact sedan that has an optional turbo-charged, 16-valve
four-cylinder engine. The Galant is a compact upscale sedan; its
top model has a 16-valve engine and electronically controlled
suspension, along with optional anti-lock brakes. In early 1989,
Mitsubishi will introduce its Diamond-Star Eclipse sporty coupe as
a 1990 model.
   Mitsubishi's new four-door Montero compact sport-utility vehicle
has a V6 engine and four-wheel-drive. It is longer and wider than
its two-door predecessor, which also gets a the 3.0-liter V6 that
Mitsubishi shares with Chrysler.
   PEUGEOT: The French automaker is fighting for a U.S. comeback
with two luxury-oriented models, the new front-wheel-drive 405
midsize sedan and the larger, restyled 505 sedan and station wagon.
Engines on the 405, Europe's Car of the Year for 1988, include a
four-cylinder multi-valve version. The 505 comes with
four-cylinder, V6 or turbo-charged four-cylinder engines. Anti-lock
brakes are standard on most 505 models and optional on some 405s.
   PORSCHE: The German luxury-sports car maker adds anti-lock
braking, Blaupunkt digital cassette stereo, electric-tilt removable
sunroof, central locking and alarm system and electric seat
adjustment as standard equipment on its 944, 944 S2 and 944 Turbo
models. The alarm system and other touches also come on 911 and 928
models.
   VOLKSWAGEN=
   AUDI: Audi replaces its 5000 luxury sedan line with the 100 and
200 series, both available in a Quattra all-wheel-drive version.
All have five-cylinder engines, with a 130-horsepower version on
the 100 and 162-horsepower edition on the 200. All Audi models,
including the smaller 80 and 90 sport sedans, now come with the
``Audi Advantage,'' a package that includes a three-year
bumper-to-bumper warranty, free routine maintenance for three years
and guaranteed trade-in value.
   VOLKSWAGEN: VW brings three new models from Europe during 1989.
The aerodynamic, all-wheel-drive Passat midsize family sedan and
wagon, the wide-track GTI Rally specialty performance hatchback and
the Corrado, a $20,000 sports car all will reach these shores
during 1989 but probably sell as 1990 models.

   With little advertising and less fanfare, the
Ford Probe is speeding through dealer showrooms, keeping most
buyers waiting at least six weeks for delivery of a car that may be
carving its own market niche.
   Since its formal introduction last May, the Probe, built beside
the Mazda MX-6 at Mazda Motor Manufacturing USA Corp.'s Flat Rock
plant south of Detroit, is being sold three months in advance of
assembly line runs, Ford Motor Co. analyst Ray Windecker said.
   Delivery time can vary depending on what kind and color
automobile a customer wants.
   The American car-buying public got a dose of what Ford had in
mind months before its formal introduction. The news media,
specifically the automotive magazines, sang the car's praises.
   ``By the time the cars were introduced, more than one-third of
the car-buying age populous was aware of the car,'' Windecker said.
   ``I don't think there's been that much excitement about a
domestic car since a Taurus,'' another Ford that was introduced in
December 1985, said Beth Fusco, an auto analyst with Moody's
Investor Services in New York City.
   ``They did a lot of advance promotion for the car in
magazines,'' she said. ``I thought that was a pretty sophisticated
send-off. I think they did a good job promoting it, and I think the
car is selling itself.''
   Probe's base price is $11,490 with a 2.2 liter, four-cylinder
engine. The car, with hidden headlamps and a swept-back rear deck,
can be upgraded with a turbocharged engine and option packages to
$17,292.
   Earlier this summer, scores of Probes reached the end of the
assembly line at Flat Rock needing repairs.
   Mazda quality control manager James G. Bouck said the quality
problems were created when a second shift was added at the plant _
a joint-venture between Ford and Mazda _ and some workers were
retrained and moved from one shift to another.
   Bouck, who moved to Mazda from General Motors Corp., said Mazda
has more stringent quality demands that some other automakers. That
can result in more cars landing in repair lots before being shipped
to dealers.
   ``Our repair inventory is about 300 now,'' he said, calling it
an expected number.
   Probe sales have grown at a steady clip _ about 600 cars more
are sold each month than in the preceding one. No one at Ford would
reveal projected sales figures, but Windecker said demand has
outstripped those projections.
   It's too early to tell exactly where Probe will fit into the
American car market.
   ``They are creating a different niche for themselves,'' Fusco
said. But, she cautioned, ``I think you have to be really careful
when you're creating a niche.
   ``Look what GM did with Fiero,'' she said, referring to the
Pontiac two-seater that sold well in its first few years on the
market before falling off dramatically. GM stopped making the car
earlier this year.
   Analysts said the Probe has capitalized on the No. 2 and most
profitable automaker's strengths _ solid design, careful marketing
and reliability.
   ``They have done many things right,'' said Richard Henderson, an
analyst with the Pershing Division of Donaldson, Lufkin and
Jenrette in New York City. ``It's a combination of many, many
little factors, some borrowed from Europe, some from North America
and some borrowed from Mazda.
   ``Combine that with a nice fit in its product mix ... and you've
got a very successful car,'' Henderson said.
   Like other newly introduced cars, Probe's engineering initially
may take a back seat to its looks.
   ``What is there out there in that price range that looks that
neat?'' asked Fusco. ``I think people buy cars because they look
good, and secondarily because the quality is good and the warranty
is good.''
   Like other Fords, Probe carries a one-year bumper-to-bumper
warranty and a six-year, 60,000-mile powertrain warranty.

   The nation's automakers and suppliers are
offering a growing array of anti-theft devices in an effort to stem
the growing number of stolen vehicles.
   Most of the devices marketed by the Big Three, Honda, Mazda,
Nissan and Toyota involve alarms that honk the horn and flash the
headlights to scare off a would-be car thief. Others systems
disengage starter motors.
   Most of the devices supplied by automakers as standard equipment
come on the maker's more expensive cars. The systems are optional
on many less-expensive models.
   Then there are devices that an owner can pick up at a local auto
parts store _ things that fit around the steering column like a big
doughnut, menacing-looking hooks that lock the steering wheel to
the brake pedal, and still other systems that detect motion and
sound, such as breaking glass.
   Despite all the technology put into anti-theft systems by
automakers and parts suppliers, there was a 5.3 percent rise in the
number of car thefts in the nation from 1986 to 1987, the latest
annual figures available from the FBI.
   And the National Auto Theft Bureau in Chicago says while those
devices may stymie thieves, most of the cars stolen nowadays fall
into two categories _ cars in which keys were left in the ignition
and cars that were simply towed away.
   ``Approximately 13 percent of the recovered (stolen) vehicles
still had the owner's keys in the vehicles ...'' said Tim Kett of
the organization. ``About 10 percent of the vehicles were towed.
This is a common technique used (by thieves) in urban areas.''
   When tow trucks aren't used by thieves, there are a variety of
products offered outside dealerships designed to keep a driver's
car where the driver left it.
   Collars that cover ignition switches and joints in steering
columns can prevent the plastic covering from being easily removed,
exposing wiring for the column controls, including the ignition.
   Alarms that sound when a door is pried open when windows are
smashed or when the car moves also are available.
   Motion detectors have caused some headaches, especially in
heavily urban areas, when they can be activated by a nudge from a
passerby or another vehicle, for instance.
   Aaron Lowe, director of government affairs for the Vehicle
Security Association, a trade organization for makers and marketers
of alarm and vehicle protection systems, said the security industry
is beginning to make more sophisticated and less-sensitive motion
detectors.
   There are some systems available in the after-market which can
alert a driver through a pager that someone may be trying to get
into a car. There are systems which interrupt the electrical or
fuel systems when a door, hood or trunk is opened.
   ``There are a wide range of things a consumer can get, depending
on where they are and what they want to protect,'' Lowe said.

   The likelihood of injury from a car accident
ranges widely among different car models, but for the most part
safety increases with automobile size, according to an insurance
industry report.
   The report on injury claims involving 207 popular models shows
that small cars have by far the highest injury loss records, while
station wagons and large cars often afford the greatest protection.
   According to the insurance group, the Mercedes-Benz SDL-SEL
sedan, which is equipped with a driver-side airbag, had the best
safety record with injury losses that were 58 percent lower than
the average for all cars. Close behind was the Pontiac Safari
station wagon.
   The least safe car was the 4-door Chevrolet Spectrum which had
injury losses that were 78 percent above average, followed by the
4-door Chevrolet Sprint and 4-door Hyundai Excel, both of which had
losses 67 percent above average, the report said.
   Of the 10 cars with the best injury loss record, nine were
categorized as ``large'' cars including five station wagons and
vans. The Saab 9000 was the only ``mid-size'' car in the top 10
vehicles, ranking fifth best with injury losses 51 percent lower
than average.
   The 10 vehicles with the worst injury loss record were all in
the small sedan or small sports car category.
   Exceptions to the general trend that small cars afford the least
protection include another Saab model, the Saab 900, as well as the
Volkswagen Vanagon, the Toyota van, Porsche 944 coupe and Mercedes
Benz 380-560 SL convertible. All are in the ``small'' category but
had better than average injury loss records.
   But except for the Saab 900, all 60 of the ``small'' sedan
models had higher injury losses than average.
   The report by the Highway Loss Data Institute, an insurance
industry research group, covered 1985-87 model cars, but spokesmen
said the findings can be used as a guide for later model vehicles
as well.
   ``The loss experience of most cars is consistent from one model
year to another,'' said Brian O'Neill, the institute's president.
   The report said the results were adjusted to take into account
various ``non-vehicle factors'' such as types and ages of drivers
that might be associated with particular vehicles.
   The 2-door Chevrolet Cavalier was the only mid-size car to have
``substantially worse than average'' injury losses _ 36 percent
worse than average for all vehicles.
   All but two of the 35 ``large'' cars, station wagons, vans and
speciality cars had lower than average injury losses. The 4-door
Oldsmobile Delta 88 and Cadillac Fleetwood-Deville were the
exceptions, ranked as average.
   Of the 207 cars and vans included in the study, 40 had safety
records that were characterized as ``substantially better'' than
average, while 32 were ``substantially worse.''

   Here are the cars ranked as having
``substantially better'' and ``substantially worse'' injury loss
records, according to the Highway Loss Data Institute, an insurance
industry research group.
   These vehicles have injury loss records of at least 30 percent
greater or 30 percent less than the average for the 207 vehicles
examined.
   The number in parenthesis after each vehicle represents the
relative injury loss rate. The lower the number the better the loss
rate; 100 is the average for all vehicles. For example, a 40 would
mean a loss rate of 60 percent below average. A 140 would be a loss
rate of 40 percent greater than average.

   Driving speed will not have much effect on tire performance or
wear, according to test engineers at Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.
   ``In terms of getting from point A to point B, the increase in
speed will compress the time needed to make the trip, but it won't
have any appreciable effect on either tire wear or performance,
unless you engage in sharp cornering, braking or similar maneuvers
at high speed,'' says Walt DeVinney, director of tire testing.
   Goodyear also had this advice:
   _ ``Cold'' air pressure readings on your tires should not exceed
the maximum air pressure specified on the tire sidewall, 35 pounds
per square inch on most cars. Tire inflation checks should be made
often.
   _ Tires on automobiles and light trucks should be rotated at
6,000 to 8,000 miles and again at 18,000 to 24,000 miles, except
when the manufacturer advises otherwise. Rotation usually will mean
more even treadwear, says Goodyear.
   _ All four tires should be of the same type of construction,
except winter tires on drive wheels, or temporary spares supplied
with the wheels.
   _ If replacing tires and you need only two, mount the newest and
best-treaded on the drive wheels.

   With winter, and its rain, snow, sleet and sub-freezing
temperatures in the offing, car care becomes especially important.
   Motorists are advised to have a professional technician check
for signs of wear on the car.
   Walt Alley, director of training at the Midas Insitute of
Technology in Palatine, Ill., suggests checking these car service
areas:
   _ Brakes. Checks brake pads and shoes for wear.
   _ Exhaust system. Look for holes in the muffler, exhaust or
tailpipe.
   _ Oil and lube. Use the proper winter weight motor oil and give
your car a lube job to help protect suspension and steering parts.
   _ Shocks. Worn-out shock absorbers can hinder braking,
especially during sudden stops, and allow excessive body rolls on
curves.
   Alley also suggests assembling a ``winter survival'' kit to keep
in the trunk, to include booster cables, shovel, tow chain, rock
salt or sand, emergency flares, flashlight, and first-aid kit.
   Racing driver Alan Kulwicki advises car owners also check tires,
the gas tank _ running out of gas and flat tires and the two
leading non-mechanical causes of highway breakdowns, he says _ and
antifreeze.
   ``Check your antifreeze to make sure both that you have enough
and that the system is clean,'' says Kulwicki, who drives his own
racing cars for the Zerex racing team. ``A good habit to get into
is to check the antifreeze every time you check the oil, especially
if you've been driving hard.
   ``Always be sure the ignition is off and the engine cold when
opening the radiator,'' he says.
   If the coolant looks dirty, he says, have the cooling system
flushed and replace the antifreeze. If the level is low, add some.
   A 50-50 mix of antifreeze and water usually provides the best
protection against overheating, Kulwicki says.

   Many motorists who wear seat belts are still
exposing themselves to serious injury by wearing them improperly,
according to a federal study that says women, children and
motorists over 50 are most likely to put themselves at risk.
   The National Transportation Safety Board study raised questions
bout the way some belt users wear the safety devices after
examining 167 accidents in which at least one occupant was belted.
   Twenty-one percent of the motorists wearing belts had too much
slack in the shoulder harnesses, and 7 percent of the occupants,
often children, wore belts that were improperly routed behind the
back or under an arm.
   Thirty-one states have laws requiring use of safety belts. But
NTSB Chairman Jim Burnett said, ``We have a lot of misuse and that
problem has to be tackled.''
   Overall, the safety board said, lap-shoulder belts provide
excellent protection with 80 percent of the belted occupants
suffering minor or no injuries. But the study suggested the results
could have been even better were it not for improper wearing of
belts.
   The NTSB study was not a random sample and, therefore, does not
necessarily translate into similar percentages for all motorists,
said Lynne Smith, who was involved in writing of the report. But,
she added, the data are consistent with previous findings of
widespread misuse.
   The four-member safety board urged the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration to require that safety belts meet standards
for the maximum amount of slack allowed or require that the belt
systems be equipped with a ``pre-tension'' device that
automatically pulls a belt tight a split second before a crash.
   The safety board questioned the widespread use among U.S.
carmakers of a belt design that allows a person to pull the belt
out to its full length without it automatically retracting. Most
foreign manufacturers use another design which automatically keeps
the belt snug against the occupant, but which has been criticized
as being less comfortable and, therefore, less likely to be used.
   The safety board said there is evidence indicating drivers aged
50 years or older and female occupants are the most likely to
misuse belts, especially wearing them too loosely. Ms. Smith said
that, generally, slack equal to no more than the width of a fist
should be allowed in the shoulder belt.
   A particularly high misuse of belts was found among children.
One-third had part of the belts behind the back or under an arm.
   ``Such misuse ... seriously degrades the protective capabilities
of the lap-shoulder belt, reducing it to a lap-only belt with
inferior crash protection,'' the safety board said.
   NHTSA, which issues auto safety regulations, was reviewing the
NTSB report, said spokeswoman Betsy Tyson.

   Cars, pickups, jeeps, trucks, recreation vehicles _ and now,
conversion vans.
   One more option in considering wheels in an auto-conscious
country is the conversion van, a full-size utility and minivan that
is shipped without windows and seats and such and then converted to
a passenger vehicle.
   Some van converters start with a sheet metal box, a motor and
wheels and add seating, sidewalls, insulation, wiring, seat belts,
wood trim, radios and TVs, windows, and exterior trim.
   Conversion van sales increased 13 percent in 1987, according to
the Automotive News.
   ``We posted a 38 percent increase and are projecting even
greater interest in the 1989 model year,'' says William T. Becker,
vice president of marketing, advertising and consumer relations for
Glaval Inc., an Elkhart, Ind., conversion company.

   The 1929 Duesenberg J., the 1931 Bugatti Royale and the 1928
Isotta Fraschini are among the 12 classic automobiles in the
Franklin Mint Precision Model collection.
   Model-makers at the Franklin Mint near Philadelphia sculptured
prototypes of the luxury cars on a 1:43 scale, noting details
inside and out, including tiny instruments and gauges on the
dashboards.
   Matching dies were made for each of the components, at least 50
parts for each model, which was then painted and hand-polished.
   Among the models is that of the 1931 Bugatti Royale, which
weighed in a 7,150 pounds and now valued at more than $8 million,
with some estimates over $20 million.
   Tom Monaghan, whose businesses include Domino's Pizza and the
Detroit Tigers baseball team, paid $8.1 million in 1986 for one of
six Bugatti Royales ever manufactured, said to be the only one not
housed in a museum.

   The name game was played at the recent Greater New York
International Automobile Show: Would a car by any other name sell
as well?
   Can you guess where the names come from?
   Volkswagen Jetta was named after the jetstream, as the Scirocco
came from the Italian for a North African wind, and the Golf from
the German ``golfstrom,'' for gulfstream.
   Celestial bodies were the source for the Toyota Corolla, the
sun's outer edge, and the Subaru Alcyone, part of the star cluster
Pleiades (which adorns the Subaru hood).
   The Bentley Mulsanne S was named for the Mulsanne straightaway
at Le Mans, site of five Bentley racing wins, and a region in
southern France inspired the Rolls-Royce Corniche.
   A more scientific approach is taken by NameLabs, a San
Francisco-based consulting firm that sorts through thousands of
morphenes _ a small, meaningful word part _ to create an image the
automaker wants to project. The company has blended word parts to
come up with names like Sentra and Acura, among others.
   Then, of course, there's Henry Ford's choice, the Edsel, named
after his son.

   Texans seem to be driven by stronger passions
than the rest of the nation when it comes to cars and trucks,
according to a new survey. They like pickups, custom paint jobs,
car telephones and big hood ornaments.
   ``The survey throughout the whole country shows that cars are
important in other areas, but Texans really seem to be turned on
about their cars,'' said Rick Williams, a marketing specialist for
Chevron U.S.A. Inc., which commissioned the survey.
   ``The freewheeling tradition that people like Sam Houston and
Davy Crockett carved out years ago continues to this day,''
Williams said.
   The telephone survey, taken in late May, questioned more than
1,000 Americans, roughly half men and half women.
   Participants were asked to pick the vehicle they wanted from
several choices given and to rate how well their choice fit their
lifestyle.
   Another question listed several areas such as performance, fuel
economy, appearance and maintenance asked people to rate how
important it was.
   A third listed several things, such as the hood ornament, and
asked how much each appealed.
   Among Texans, 50 percent found a luxury car like a Cadillac fit
their lifestyle at least moderately well. That's nearly 10
percentage points more than Americans overall.
   Texans also favored utility vehicles (72.3 percent vs. 50.6
percent), pickup trucks (71.2 vs. 53.2), sports cars (40 vs. 33.6)
and basic American sedans (67.6 vs. 63.7).
   On the other hand, 39.6 percent of Americans found European
luxury sedans like a Mercedes very well-suited to their lifestyle,
while 37.8 percent of Texans surveyed agreed.
   Some 37.2 percent of Texas drivers love their car phones, the
survey found, while the devices found favor with 20.6 percent of
Americans overall. Custom paint work was favored by 20.2 percent of
the Texans, while only 12.7 percent of Americans found the paint
mattered a lot.
   Overall, 9.2 percent of respondents said they liked ornate hood
ornaments, while 14.5 percent of Texans replied in the affirmative.
   The margin of error for the overall survey was plus or minus 3
percent; a higher margin of error would apply to subgroups like
Texans.

   It is too early to say whether higher speed limits on rural
interstate highways are unsafe, but preliminary figures show only a
1 percentage point difference in traffic fatality rates, the
Transportation Department reported. The department said that during
the first nine months of 1987, traffic fatalities on highways with
the 65 mph limit rose 18 percent from a year earlier in the 37
states that had adopted the higher speed, compared with a 17
percent increase in 11 states that had not.
   However, ``The 65 mph speed limit has not been in effect long
enough to determine its long-term impact on safety,'' said the
report to Congress, required by a law allowing states to exempt
some rural highways from the 55 mph national speed limit.
   Most of the states raised their speed limits in April and May of
last year. Arizona, California, Louisiana and New Mexico accounted
for 70 percent of the fatality increase in states that raised the
rural speed limit, the study said.
   From Jan. 1, 1987, to the time of the speed limit change,
fatalities had increased 10 percent from the corresponding period a
year earlier. After the speed limit was raised through Sept. 30,
1987, fatalities were 23 percent higher than a year earlier, the
study said.
   The increase was statistically meaningful, but the study
cautioned against applying it to broad conclusions about the
long-term effects of the higher speed limit.
   While Americans debate the pros and cons of a 55-mph speed
limit, most West Europeans legally drive much faster than that, and
they've been doing so with a lower fatality rate than the United
States.
   West Germans can go as fast as they want on their highway system
known as the autobahn so long as they obey other traffic rules,
such as the proper use of directional signals when changing lanes.
   Elsewhere in Western Europe, speed limits range from 86.6 mph in
Italy to 55 mph in Ireland, which does not have an extensive
superhighway system.
   The latest statistics of the 12-nation European Economic
Community, for 1986, when a uniform 55-mph limit was still in
effect in the United States, indicate a highway fatality rate of
14.4 per 100,000 population in contrast to 19.9 in the United
States that year.
   The 1986 highway death toll for EEC nations, with a total
population of 320 million, was 46,046; in the United States, with a
popultion fo 242 million, the motor vehicle fatalities numbered
47,900.
   This past March, however, the U.S. Department of Transportation
said traffic fatalities in the United States for 1987 were the
lowest in history, as measured by 100 million miles of travel. It
put the rate by that measurement at 2.4 deaths compared to 2.5 in
1986, 3.3 in 1980 and 24.08 in 1921, the first year the calculation
was made.
   The department attributed the 1987 decline to the increasing use
of seat belts and a reduction in drunken driving.
   Seat belts are required in most West European countries, as they
are in 32 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. Italy plans to
require seat belts by September, 1989.
   Many European countries also have stiff penalties for drunken
driving.

   Safety will be among the choices new car buyers will have this
year, according to the National Coalition to Reduce Car Crash
Injuries.
   Air bags and anti-lock brakes are two of the major safety
devices that many manufacturers are offering. Three-point rear seat
belts will also be more commonplace this model year, the Coalition
points out.
   Eleven of the world's 17 largest automobile manufacturers will
offer inflatable air restraint systems as either standard or
optional equipment, according to a study conducted by Ralph Nader,
consumer advocate.
   Four other manufacturers have committed to air bags beginning in
1990 and General Motors _ which offers them as options on the Delta
88 _ says it will offer 3 million cars with air bags by 1992.
   Anti-lock brakes were offered as standard or optional equipment
by 17 of 23 auto manufacturers recently surveyed by the Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety.

   ``Comparison shopping'' for an auto insurer can result in
sharply reduced insurance costs.
   ``While all auto insurance policies may appear similar, quite
the opposite is true,'' says Charles F. Wright, assistant vice
president, Aetna Life & Casualty, ``and a smart consumer can often
save hundreds of dollars.
   Some of the money-saving discounts offered by various companies,
he says, include:
   _ A ``total account'' credit to those who insure both car and
home with the same company. The credit differs from state to state,
Wright says, but is usually 10 percent off the auto premium, or 5
percent off both auto and homeowner premiums.
   _ Some companies offer a ``first accident forgiveness'' which,
after five continous accident-free years, guarantees that rates
will not go up after a first at-fault accident.
   _ Car pool commuters often qualify for discounts.
   _ Installing anti-theft devices in your car may qualify you for
a discount. ``A 5 percent credit is typical for an alarm-only
device or an active disabling mechanism which prevents the car from
starting,'' says Wright. Some companies offer a 10 percent credit
for a passive disabling device that automatically prevents the car
from starting.
   _ You can save money by insuring children who drive infrequently
because they are away at school on the parents' policy rather than
separately.
   _ Check the companies that make discounts available to females
between 30 and 64 years old who are the only drivers in the
household.
   _ Good driver discounts are offered by some companies to drivers
with accident-and-violation free records and to motorists driving
fewer than a certain number of miles a year.
   _ Some states require discounts be given to drivers who take
driver training or defensive driving courses.
   _ Drivers still at school may be entitled to a ``good student
discount'' program by maintaining a high scholastic average.

   A new, easier to read road map of Texas denotes major cities in
type more than one-quarter inch high, with small town names more
than twice as large as national road atlases.
   The 203-page Texas Road Atlas and Recreation Directory, which
has 79 pges of large-scale sectional maps of the state, is produced
by Rand McNally's Austin, Texas, branch.
   ``Our Austin cartographic people didn't make the maps at such
large scale because we thought Texans had more eye problems than
the rest of the country,'' said Michael Dobson, director of
catographic services for Rand McNally. ``Rather, it's because the
population is aging throughout the country.
   ``Also, everyone at times has to read maps under dim lighting
conditions. Under the dome light of a car or truck at night, for
example. The only practicl format for such easy-to-read maps is a

   Jack Daniel whiskey, distilled in a
rustic Tennessee hollow and promoted in advertising featuring
weather-beaten men in bib overalls, may be going upscale.
   The down-home sippin' whiskey reportedly will have a new,
refined version called ``Gentleman Jack,'' priced higher than its
famous country cousin.
   News media have been alerted to a small-town fair Sept. 30 in
Lynchburg _ population 361 _ where the Jack Daniel distillery is
located.
   That's when they'll roll out the barrel for a taste.
   ``Gentleman Jack'' would be the distillery's first new whiskey
in 100 years.
   ``We've spent a long time developing it,'' Arthur S. Hancock,
executive vice president of Jack Daniel, told The Tennessean,
Nashville's morning newspaper.
   The paper quoted anonymous sources as saying Gentleman Jack
would be filtered through charcoal twice, once before it goes into
barrels for aging and again before it is bottled. Regular Jack is
filtered through charcoal once, before it is put in the barrels.
   Promotional material sent to reporters Friday invited them to
``the celebration of the century'' in Lynchburg outside the
red-brick courthouse.
   ``Everyone will gather on the courthouse square for square
dancing, cake walks, lemonade...'' a media advisory said on a
letter adorned by Jack's picture, showing him in a wide-brimmed
western hat and proudly sporting a handlebar mustache.
   Dana Reece, a spokeswoman for the celebration, declined to
elaborate on the announcement.
   Jack Daniel, located 75 miles south of Nashville in the rolling
Tennessee hills, was established in 1866 and is the oldest
registered distillery in the United States.
   The product, Lynchburg's only major industry, is billed as
``whiskey as our fathers made it.''
   The whiskey can be distilled in Lynchburg but not consumed
because the town is in a dry county. Toasts to the new Jack will
have to be held in an adjoining county.
   The company said any new product would be ``the first new
whiskey to come out of the hollow since Tennessee rejoined the
Union.''

<HEAD>Michael Jackson Overtakes Cosby as Highest-Paid Entertainer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   He's bad, he's bad, and he makes a lot of money
at it: Michael Jackson is the world's highest-paid entertainer,
according to Forbes magazine.
   Jackson, who ranked ninth last year in the magazine's list of
the 40 best-paid celebrities, moonwalked his way past Bill Cosby to
No. 1 by raking in an estimated $60 million this year, the magazine
said in its Oct. 3 edition.
   Jackson is expected to earn a total of $97 million for 1987 and
1988, Forbes said
   The 30-year-old entertainer made approximately $40 million from
his recent worldwide tour, with the rest coming from sales of his
album ``Bad,'' his autobiography, ``Moonwalk,'' Pepsi endorsements
and other music publishing, the magazine said.
   Cosby, who topped last year's list with 1986-87 income of $84
million, was No. 2 on the current list with $92 million in earnings
for 1987 and 1988, Forbes says.
   The youngest entertainer on the list was 22-year-old heavyweight
boxing champion Mike Tyson. Tyson's earnings skyrocketed from $10
million in 1987 to approximately $45 million this year, the highest
1988 income behind Jackson's, the magazine estimates.
   Two other boxers, Sugar Ray Leonard and Michael Spinks, made the
list, with $27 million and $17 million, respectively, in earnings
for the two-year period.
   In contrast, the income of America's top-grossing executive,
Charles Lazarus of Toys R Us Inc., averaged $31.5 million a year
for 1986 and 1987, the most recent two-year period for which
executive pay records are available. Lazarus made $60 million,
including about $56 million in one-time stock gains, in 1987.
   In addition to Jackson, the top 10 wealthiest celebrities and
their two-year incomes are:
   _Bill Cosby, actor, $92 million.
   _Steven Spielberg, movie maker, $64 million.
   _Sylvester Stallone, actor, $63 million.
   _Eddie Murphy, comedian and actor, $62 million.
   _Charles M. Schulz, Peanuts cartoonist, $62 million.
   _Bruce Springsteen, rock star, $61 million.
   _Mike Tyson, heavyweight boxing champion, $45 million.
   _Madonna, singer and actress, $46 million.
   _Arnold Schwarzenegger, actor, $43 million.
   The magazine notes that the top 10 averaged at least $21 million
for each of the last two years. Lazarus was the only business
executive to exceed that average. Chrysler Corp.'s Lee Iaccoca came
close with an average annual income for 1986 and 1987 of $19
million.
   Thirty other entertainers were included on the list, with Frank
Sinatra pulling in the rear with $16 million, the minimum two-year
income needed to qualify for this year's list.
   Forbes also notes that in death, perhaps more so than in life,
entertainers continue to fill pocketbooks as well as hearts.
   Elvis Presley's estate, for example, will earn approximately $15
million this year, including $11 million from Graceland Mansion,
the home Presley purchased in 1957 for $100,000 that now is a
museum honoring the entertainer.
   Other dead entertainers whose estates are making in excess of $1
million annually are Ian Fleming, author of the James Bond series,
$7.5 million; John Lennon, ex-Beatle, $5 million; Jimi Hendrix,
guitarist, $4.0 million; T.S. Eliot, poet and author, $2.5 million;
and James Dean, actor, $1.2 million.
   The Forbes Top 40 ranking includes five women. In addition to
Madonna, the list contains Oprah Winfrey, Whitney Houston, Tina
Turner and Jane Fonda.
   The magazine also noted that 25 percent of those on the list are
black.
   Forbes says the list knows no international borders and shows an
evolving culture, with 17 of the top 40 in the music business.
   ``No longer are steel mills or auto factories or oil wells the
principal sources of great wealth,'' it says. ``In the
postindustrial society, the once despised entertainment industry
has usurped that role.''

   A judge Monday postponed a hearing on the
government's $3 billion lawsuit against Union Carbide Corp. seeking
compensation for the 1984 gas disaster that killed 2,800 people and
injured more than 20,000.
   Bhopal District Judge M.W. Deo reset the hearing for Oct. 1
after both sides said the Supreme Court had yet to rule on appeals
for interim relief to those injured in the world's worst industrial
accident.
   The Indian government is contesting a high court ruling that
reduced interim relief from 3.5 billion rupees ($270 million) to
2.5 billion rupees ($192 million).
   Union Carbide is challenging both awards, saying the courts
cannot order relief payment until responsibility for the leak has
been determined.
   A decision on the appeals is expected within a week, Advocate
General A.M. Mathur told the judge.
   The disaster occurred on Dec. 3, 1984, when toxic methyl
iso-cyanate gas leaked from the pesticide plant operated by Union
Carbide's Indian subsidiary.
   The government filed the lawsuit against Union Carbide in Bhopal
District Court in 1986 after passing a law making it the sole
representative of all the victims.
   The government claims the accident was caused by negligence and
filed criminal charges against seven Carbide officials. Union
Carbide maintains the leak was due to sabotage by a disgruntled
employee.
   The government also has presented copies of claims filed by more
than 5,000 people injured in the accident and has asked the court
to order Union Carbide to produce a copy of its insurance policy.
   Union Carbide, based in Danbury, Conn., earlier said it could
not be sued because the Bhopal plant was run by its subsidiary,
Union Carbide India Ltd. The government contends the insurance
policy will prove that Union Carbide controlled the plant and
therefore should pay compensation to the victims.
   ``We will inform you at the next hearing on whether we are
filing the insurance policy or not,'' Anil Diwan, a lawyer for
Union Carbide, told the judge.

<TEXT>
   American Brands Inc., which recently thwarted a
hostile takeover with the ``Pac-Man defense'' of buying the suitor,
won't re-use the strategy to derail another possible attempt that
has emerged, the tobacco giant's chairman said in an interview
published today.
   ``You can bet this isn't going to be a Pac-Man,'' William J.
Alley was quoted as telling the Wall Street Journal.
   Speculation that American Brands would re-deploy the Pac-Man
surfaced after New York investor  LeBow's maneuvering was interpreted by
American Brands
executives as a ruse to induce them to buy Liggett, which has lost
market share in recent years to competitors, the Journal said.
   It quoted Alley as calling LeBow's move ``an outrageous ploy to
get us to bail them out from what appears to be a deteriorating
situation at Liggett.''
   The newspaper also quoted Alley as saying American Brands isn't
for sale, he has no interest in talking with LeBow and ``we
wouldn't take Liggett if they gave it to us.''
   Based in Greenwich, Conn., American Brands is a diversified
tobacco company with a 7.2 percent share of the cigarette market,
selling brands that include Lucky Strike, Pall Mall and Tareyton.
   Liggett, based in Durham, N.C., has a 3 percent market share and
makes such brands as Chesterfield, L&M and Eve.

   Service Merchandise Co. Inc. said a

transaction.
   S.P. Braud, vice president and chief financial officer of

   The company's shares now are traded on the over-the-counter

closing stock price of $13.50 a share Friday, Service Merchandise
has a market value of $449.5 million.
   Service Merchandise, the largest catalog showroom retailer in
the United States, said in a news release Sunday that a special
committee of the company's board of directors was set up to respond
to any such offer and to take other action related to a possible
sale.
   ``The investor group has informed the special committee that,
given relevant financing restrictions, any offer it might make
would be at or near recent market prices for the company's stock,''
the release said.
   Zimmerman declined to comment on any possible deal.

   The stock market turned downward in quiet
trading today, giving up some of last week's gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 6.94 to 2,091.21 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 2 to 1 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 302 up, 584 down and
468 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 18.54 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Last week, the market extended an advance it began in late
August with a lift from fresh evidence that economic growth was
slowing to a moderate pace.
   The government reported a larger-than-expected decline in the
nation's trade deficit for July as imports slowed.
   Most analysts agree that the recent slackening in the pace of
business activity has at least postponed any further moves by the
Federal Reserve to tighten credit.
   But some argue that the central bank will have to take further
steps sooner or later in its avowed mission to keep inflationary
pressures from reviving.
   Losers among the blue chips included General Electric, down \ at
43; American Express, down ] at 29[, and Exxon, down ] at 45].
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.55 to 152.24. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .17 at 298.05.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 5.87 to
2,098.15, finishing the week with a net gain of 29.34 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 3 on the
NYSE, with 898 up, 527 down and 517 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 211.11 million shares, against 161.21

<HEAD>Saudis Exceeding Quota; Price Committee Location Decided</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia is intentionally exceeding its oil
production quota in response to the breakdown in discipline within
OPEC and in hopes of influencing an upcoming price committee
meeting, a respected oil industry newsletter said Monday.
   The Petroleum Intelligence Weekly said Saudi Arabia is exceeding
its quota in an effort to challenge other quota violators to stop
overproduction. The newsletter said the Saudis are expected to
offer to return to their quota only when other OPEC members do so.
   Meanwhile, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman said the organization's
five-member price committee will meet either on the Indonesian
island of Bali or in Vienna on Sept. 25 and 26.
   Lukman, speaking on his arrival at the site of the Asia-Pacific
Petroleum Conference, declined to be specific, telling reporters,
``Why don't you ask Subroto?''
   OPEC Secretary General Subroto currently is in the Austrian
capital.
   Although the price committee can't make pricing adjustments, it
has the authority to call a full meeting of all 13 members of OPEC.
   Oil prices rose last week when the meeting was announced,
reflecting the market's optimism that such a gathering could mean
that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was
interested in restraining output and raising world oil prices.
   Prices eased late in the week, however, partly in response to a
statement from Iraq that it would not go along with an OPEC-imposed
quota.
   Iraq, as well as other OPEC countries, have been exceeding their
quotas, dumping more than a million barrels of oil a day more than
the market can absorb, according to some analysts.
   Last week, the Saudis announced special discounts to some
countries, leading some analysts to speculate that OPEC's largest
producer had given up its quota in favor of competing for market
share.
   The weekly newsletter said the Saudis had violated their
4.35-million-barrel-a-day quota in order to influence the Sept. 25
meeting, but did not say by how much.
   Saudi Arabia is expected to formally confirm its supply
violation to fellow committee members, the newsletter said.
   Lukman, meanwhile, took issue with the Saudi report, saying
exceeding quotas was not the way to solve the oversupply problem.
Lukman also said reports that OPEC's production had reached 20
million barrels a day were exaggerated. He declined to say how much
the cartel is producing.
   Lukman also said unilateral efforts by OPEC to shore up the oil
market through production quotas in the face of excess world supply
allowed other producers to take a more than two-thirds share of
global production.
   This, he said, ``sowed the seeds of the oil market crisis of
1986.''
   Lukman said he would be meeting with representatives of non-OPEC
countries attending the APPEC sessions regarding the shaky crude
oil market.
   Non-OPEC oil producers at APPEC include Egypt, Malaysia, and
Oman. Lukman declined to comment on the nature or extent of the
meetings.

   The stock market retreated today, giving up some
of last week's gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 29.34 points last
week, fell 17.69 to 2,090.55 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 2 to 1 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 47.22 million shares at
midmorning.
   Last week, the market extended an advance it began in late
August with a lift from fresh evidence that economic growth was
slowing to a moderate pace.
   The government reported a larger-than-expected decline in the
nation's trade deficit for July as imports slowed.
   Most analysts agree that the recent slackening in the pace of
business activity has at least postponed any further moves by the
Federal Reserve to tighten credit.
   But some argue that the central bank will have to take further
steps sooner or later in its avowed mission to keep inflationary
pressures from reviving.
   Losers among the blue chips included General Electric, down [ at
43[; American Express, down \ at 29\, and International Business
Machines, down { at 113}.
   Reebok International slumped 1\ to 10}. On Friday the company
projected lower earnings for the third quarter and the year.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.09 to 151.70. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .80 at 297.42.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Open Lower On Follow-Through</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened lower today on
the Chicago Board of Trade, with soybeans falling substantially in
a continuation of the selling flurry that erupted near the close of
Friday's session.
   The decline was technically motivated, since fundamental
supply-and-demand factors were bullish for soybeans, analysts said.
   Investment houses were major sellers of soybean futures, said
Dale Gustafson, an analyst in Chicago with Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc.
   ``They're looking for some sort of support down here'' at price
levels 40 cents to 50 cents a bushel below last week's highs, he
said.
   Weekend rains in Brazil, where the soybean crop is just getting
started, also pressured U.S. soybean futures prices, analysts said.
   Grain futures basically followed the soybean market lower,
although early losses in the wheat market were limited by
confirmation of new sales of subsidized U.S. wheat to Algeria and
Morocco, Gustafson said.
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent to 2\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.16{ a bushel; corn was }
cent to 2{ cents lower with September at $2.77 a bushel; oats were
4} cents to 6 cents lower with December at $2.60 a bushel; soybeans
were 8 cents to 12 cents lower with September at $8.38 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were lower in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .50 cent lower to .30 cent higher with October
at 69.45 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to .70 cent
higher with September at 80.05 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent to
.17 cent lower with October at 37.80 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .22 cent to .70 cent lower with February at 50.15
cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled higher on Friday.

<HEAD>Japanese Agricultural Union Will Ask U.S. Farmers For Help</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's powerful Zenchu agricultural union said it
plans to seek support from U.S. farmers in its fight to protect the
Japanese rice market from foreign imports.
   A spokesman for Zenchu, the Central Union of Agricultural
Cooperatives, said at a meeting Monday it would send a team of
representatives to the United States to seek support directly from
American farmers.
   The union Monday also called for a demonstration by 1 million
Japanese in October to show their support for the union's stance.
   Last week, the U.S. Rice Millers Association filed a complaint
with the U.S. Trade Representative's office under Section 301 of
the recently passed U.S. omnibus trade law, which requires the
president to retaliate against a country failing to give equal
access to its markets.
   The U.S. trade office turned down a similar complaint under the
old Section 301 before the omnibus trade law was passed.
   Union Executive Director Tokuo Matsumoto emphasized at the
meeting that the rice growers have the support of Japanese
consumers.
   Matsumoto also said that, ``the U.S. market for corn and wheat
is effectively closed, so it is strange to criticize the closed
nature of the Japanese rice market.''
   Matsumoto said it was impossible to make a simple comparison
between prices in an open and closed market.
   ``It is necessary to consider various factors such as wages and
consumer prices in general,'' he said.

<HEAD>CSX Announces Restructuring Program, Will Repurchase Stock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CSX Corp. is embarking on a billion-dollar
restructuring program aimed at focusing the company's resources on
its transportation businesses, officials announced today.
   CSX officials said the company would repurchase up to 60 million
common shares and sell the company's natural gas transmission and
natural gas liquids processing businesses, Texas Gas Transmission
Corp. of Owensboro, Ky. and CSX NGL Corp. of Houston.
   The company is ``immediately launching an aggressive program
designed to significantly reduce operating and overhead costs,''
officials said. It will also consider selling some of its resort
properties.
   Wall Street reacted enthusiastically to the announcement. CSX
stock rose sharply on the New York Stock Exchange today, trading at
$30.75 a share, up $3.87{ from Friday.
   CSX said it would purchase up to 40 million shares, representing
26 percent of its outstanding stock, through a ``Dutch auction''
beginning later this week.
   Under the auction, shareholders will be invited to specify
prices ranging from $28 to $33 per share for their holdings. The
company will then select a single purchase price and will buy up to
40 million shares offered at or below that price.
   The offer is being mailed to shareholders this week and will
close Oct. 18, CSX spokesman Thomas E. Hoppin said.
   The company then may repurchase the remainder of the 60 million
shares, approximately 38 percent of its oustanding shares, in the
open market or in private negotiations, officials said.
   At $33 a share, the buyback would cost CSX $1.98 billion.
   Initial funding for the repurchase will come from cash and
short-term borrowings.
   The company also said it will redeem four series of preferred
stock issued by its subsidiaries CSX Transportion Inc. and Seaboard
Coast Line Railroad Co.

   How many junior executives does it take
to cross a stream with three wobbly boards?
   About a dozen, but wait till you try.
   Imagine getting a team of aggressive independent-thinkers to
stop over-analyzing the situation long enough to scramble across
the creek in 20 minutes.
   That's the mission of one Outward Bound exercise that comes with
a package of adventure training here in the Rocky Mountains.
   The creek crossing is part of a day of ``problem solving''
designed to force participants to work as a team in a rough _ very
rough _ equivalent of a business crisis.
   One team of managers that recently attempted the so-called
``acid river test'' included this reporter, drafted by The
Associated Press to experience the training firsthand.
   Our team, made up of managers from a number of different
companies, ventured to the stream's edge with another group from
the Champion Spark Plug Co.
   My group consisted of three people who ran their own businesses
_ including a grandmother _ plus an insurance salesman, two
educators, two program directors for philanthropic organizations, a
securities lawyer, a utility executive and the chief operating
officer of a gas pipeline company.
   Each team was given three boards, which we could use to reach
blocks strategically placed in the water. If any board touched the
water we had to forfeit it.
   What's worse, we had to bring the boards with us as we went,
since the boards weren't long enough to simply lay end to end
across the stream. And if anyone fell into the water they would be
penalized by being forced to wear a blindfold.
   Our team leader, a woman in her late 20s, was confounded like
the rest of us. While she was open to suggestions, the route to dry
ground proved more anguishing than a three-aspirin meeting with the
boss.
   First there was silence, then frustration, a sprinkling of
debate and finally, anxiety.
   ``You have 10 minutes left,'' shouted the instructors.
   We quickly consigned an insurance salesman from Florida to be
our ``advance man,'' since he seemed most fit and least likely to
lose the boards in the drink as we experimented with different,
jerry-rigged configurations.
   The minutes clicked by, though, and it seemed obvious we just
didn't have enough boards. Some of us were ready to give up.
   The key came first to a woman who runs her own consulting
business. She saw that two boards placed in a T-pattern would reach
the blocks and allow us to complete a makeshift bridge with the
third board.
   Grabbing each others' shoulders or hands for support, our group
made it across with a few seconds left and yelped in triumph like a
pack of day campers.
   Looking back on it, there was no single leader, no strategy by
decree. Everyone did something to contribute. In retrospect the
solution seemed surprisingly obvious.
   Some of us also took comfort in the fact that the Champion Spark
Plug group got ``eaten'' by the acid.

<HEAD>Gavlick Machinery Can Almost Always Come Up With What Customer
Orders</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK SEAVY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRISTOL, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For a Connecticut company that buys and
sells used machinery, an aging lathe or blast furnace may be just
what the customer ordered.
   In its 31 years in business, the Gavlick Machinery Corp. has
become a matchmaker of sorts, introducing companies that have
equipment to sell to firms that want the goods.
   ``The whole fact of the matter is finding a buyer and seller and
that can be done just as easily with the smaller pieces as with the
larger ones,'' said Nancy E. Gavlick, the company's assistant vice
president.
   The used machinery market is known for its breadth and Gavlick
spans it with divisions specializing in machinery for all kinds of
industries: machine tools, video, electrical equipment, plastics,
graphic arts, chemicals and data processing, among others.
   Gavlick takes several different approaches to matchmaking.
Sometimes it purchases equipment cold from companies, knowing that
it will be able to find buyers. On other occasions, Gavlick brokers
deals between companies or auctions off equipment for firms going
out of business or closing plants.
   If a machine doesn't suit the specifications of a prospective
buyer, Gavlick is also equipped to rehabilitate or redesign it.
   ``It's as though we're an arm of the client company or a
department because we do everything from market research and
valuation to even helping them sell their products,'' said Richard
E. Gavlick, the company's president and chief executive officer.
   A former machine tool salesman, Gavlick founded the company with
his father, Isadore T. Gavlick, in 1957. Now his daughter, Nancy,
also works there.
   With 16 divisions and a computer database of more than 200,000
possible sellers and buyers around the world, the privately held
company prides itself in its ability to tackle tall orders.
   For example, the General Electric Co. was seeking to phase out a
specialized machinery line for producing wire for electrical
conductors at the same time a Chilean copper company wanted to
phase one in. Gavlick put the sale together last year, moving
General Electric's dip-form line to Metalurgica Coplasa S.A.
   ``Chile is one of the most important exporters of copper,''
Richard Gavlick said. ``Metalurgica Coplasa's use of the dip-form
line could have a significant impact on the country's copper trade
and economy.''
   But while Gavlick may have helped expand Chile's economy,
another deal helped close down a segment of Great Britain's.
   In 1981, Gavlick acted as co-agent for the sale of $500 million
worth of surplus steeling-making equipment that once operated under
the banner of the British Steel Corp. The sale, executed over two
years, cost workers in 14 steel mills across England their jobs.
   Not all Gavlick deals have international consequences and its
500,000-square-foot warehouse in Bristol is overflowing with
machinery in all shapes and sizes being rebuilt or awaiting sale.
The company also has offices in Miami and Cleckheaton, England.
   With about 100 employees at the Bristol headquarters and 40
representatives abroad, the company is ready to strike quickly when
opportunity arises, Ms. Gavlick said.
   ``We're pretty much wide open and ready to go at a moment's
notice,'' said Ms. Gavlick, who left a career as an account
executive with a New York advertising firm to join her father in
business. ``We're really going out and seeking opportunities,
rather than being reactive.''
   It's the company's readiness that makes it attractive, according
to Rudy Eberstadt, a former executive at Microdot Corp. in
Greenwich, Conn., a Gavlick customer.
   ``They stay in constant contact with the customers and they are
on top of the market,'' Eberstadt said.
   Richard J. Callahan, who heads Business Information Services
Inc., publisher of newsletters covering the wire, fastener and
supplier industries, said Gavlick is able to respond when a
business suddenly booms and needs equipment fast.
   ``When things turn around and you need it in a hurry, they'll
have it for you,'' Callahan said.
   The company, which would not disclose any financial figures, has
also seen its share of lean economic times. A 1973 fire destroyed
its 104,000-square-foot complex in Torrington, Conn., and the
downturn of the steel industry during the early 1980s hurt Gavlick,
officials said.
   Gavlick said the company made a series of purchases in the early
1980s and extended its credit, only to face a shrinking market. He
said at the height of the depression in the steel industry, Gavlick
sold machinery at a loss just to meet payroll.
   He said the steel market is now on the upswing and Gavlick
Machinery along with it.
   The company, whose sales are 60 percent foreign and 40 percent
domestic, has guided companies large and small through the sales
process.
   Once General Motors Corp. was looking for a market for its ring
forging machine, a device that produces the outer ring of a
railroad car wheel bearing. It got an offer of $225,000, but
Gavlick recommended it hold out for $475,000.
   The machine was eventually sold for $400,000.
   ``We were seen as heroes,'' Richard Gavlick said.

<HEAD>EEC Industrial Output Up 3.5 Percent in First Half</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUXEMBOURG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The index of industrial production in the
European Economic Community rose an estimated 3.5 percent in the
first half of 1988 from the same period last year, the EEC said.
   Eurostat, the trading bloc's statistics agency, said Monday that
by comparison, industrial output in the United States rose 6
percent in the first half and in Japan by nearly 11 percent.
   The increase in the EEC index was led by a 6.1 percent jump in
production of capital goods, Eurostat said. Output of consumer
goods rose 3.2 percent and of intermediate products by 2.6 percent.
   The index, using 1980 as a basis year at 100, was calculated at
111.5 in June, up from 110.1 in May and an average 107.4 for all of
1987.
   Eurostat said the gains in output in the first half in the 12
EEC nations varied from 2.5 percent and 3 percent in West Germany
and France, to around 5 percent in Britain, Italy and Spain and to
nearly 10 percent in Luxembourg and Ireland.
   The Netherlands was the only EEC country where industrial output
fell in the first half. It declined by 3.3 percent, mainly because
of a drop in natural gas production.

<HEAD>New Systems Could Bring Cheaper Fares to Europe</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two giant international airline reservations
networks are to appear in European travel agencies next year, but
the debate is already raging over whether they will be a boon to
air travelers.
   The networks, called Galileo and Amadeus, will replace the
fragmented reservation systems of Europe's national airlines, which
critics say discriminate against smaller airlines and hamper
competition on this side of the Atlantic, where fares are higher
than in the United States.
   The two groups of European airlines backing the competing
networks claim their technological sophistication will make travel
agencies more productive and better inform travelers.
   More important, the airlines promise that the systems will be
neutral _ meaning they won't favor individual carriers. Any airline
will be able to have its flight information listed in these
systems, for a fee.
   ``Our ultimate customer is the person who chooses to travel or
not to travel. We want to make his journey more cost-efficient and
time-efficient,'' said Justin Dukes, chief executive of Galileo.
   Bernard Anques, strategic planner for Amadeus, says the system
``will enable the travel passenger, especially the business
passenger, to have better products at a best price. The consumer
will be better off.''
   But not everyone is convinced that the new systems will foster
competition. Critics say the smaller airlines will remain at a
disadvantage because the new networks are owned largely by big
carriers.
   Existing systems have been accused of burying competitors'
flight information or delaying its entry into the computer,
charging high fees to list competitors, unfairly exploiting their
access to competitors' schedules and fares, and locking travel
agents into long contracts with high cancellation fees.
   Such criticisms have dogged the five airline-owned reservation
systems in the United States, where a congressional study recently
criticized the systems for stifling competition and padding profits
for their airline owners. Although the airlines that own the
systems are prohibited from listing their flights first, the
systems still give those carriers a big advantage, the study said.
   Critics of the European systems warn that because the two new
networks are separate, the skies will be ruled by two big blocs of
airlines, and that until they interconnect, the traveler cannot be
assured of access to the full range of flights available on a
particular route.
   Hugh Welburn, managing director of Travel Trends International,
a London research firm, said, ``One of the effects is likely to be
an increase in the power of the bigger airlines against the small.
Basically they offer the provider of the systems an opportunity to
handicap competitors, especially smaller competitors.''
   Ultimately, experts predict, Galileo and Amadeus will
interconnect. ``Technological development is bound to provide means
of linking these two systems. The effect of that would be to make
more choices available to the consumer,'' Welburn said.
   Swindon, England-based Galileo, whose airlines carry a total of
120 million passengers a year, is made up of shareholders British
Airways, KLM Royal Dutch Airways, Swissair, Aer Lingus, Alitalia,
Austrian Airlines, Olympic Airways, Sabena, TAP Air Portugal, and
Covia.
   Covia, which operates the U.S.-based Apollo computer reservation
system, is 51 percent owned by United Airlines.
   Madrid-based Amadeus, whose airlines carry 91 million passengers
annually, is made up of partners Air France, Iberia, Lufthansa and
Scandinavian Airlines System, plus eight associate airlines.
   Like other airlines, the network owners will have to pay to use
the system and have their flight information listed. Fees will vary
depending on the services the customers take and the competitive
conditions in the geographical area.
   The owners believe the networks, which also will include
information about train, ferry, hotel and car reservations, will
make them money as the European airline industry slowly becomes
deregulated, which should encourage people to travel more.
   More deregulation will bring a confusing array of new routes and
fares, which will have to be put into some kind of order if they
are to be sold successfully.
   Already, deregulation has spawned small independent airlines
like Virgin Atlantic Airways of Britain, the French Air Liberte,
and Transavia-Holland.
   Observers say fare wars could break out after 1992, when the
12-nation European Economic Community is to become one barrier-free
marketplace of 320 million consumers.
   U.S. computer reservation systems were the first to enter the
European market in pursuit of post-deregulation opportunities.
United Airlines and American Airlines started selling their systems
in Europe in 1985, way ahead of Galileo and Amadeus.
   Underscoring how big the stakes are, British Airways refused to
let American Airlines' Sabre system issue British Airways tickets _
even though it had been doing so in the United States _ until June,
when the two airlines reached a settlement.
   The market is ripe for selling more automation, since only 65
percent of the International Air Transport Association's (IATA)
10,500 licensed travel agencies have computer terminals, compared
with almost all 26,500 U.S. agencies in the International Airlines
Travel Agent Network.
   Systems already are going global. For example, Amadeus intends
to sign a cooperation agreement with Abacus, an Asian system.
   So far, official efforts by the EEC and others to produce codes
of conduct to govern the new systems have been piecemeal, and their
conclusions may vary, said David Kyd, an IATA spokesman.
   But proponents of the systems believe the new networks will aid
consumers by moving more reservation-making to the travel agents,
away from the individual airlines, thus dampening the incentive for
biased booking.
   ``I think all competition tends to ensure that the consumer gets
the best possible value. If the customer can choose the best fare
route, ... that is what the system will ensure,'' Galileo's Dukes
said.

   Stock prices tumbled in quiet trading today,
giving up a big chunk of last week's gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 29.34 points last
week, fell 23.47 to 2,074.68 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 2 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 342 up, 873 down and
470 unchanged.
   Last week, the market extended an advance it began in late
August with a lift from fresh evidence that economic growth was
slowing to a moderate pace.
   The government reported a larger-than-expected decline in the
nation's trade deficit for July as imports slowed.
   Most analysts agree that the recent slackening in the pace of
business activity has at least postponed any further moves by the
Federal Reserve to tighten credit.
   But some argue that the central bank will have to take further
steps sooner or later in its avowed mission to keep inflationary
pressures from reviving.
   Losers among the blue chips included General Electric, down { at
42}; Exxon, down | at 45[; Ford Motor, down \ at 49~, and
International Business Machines, down 1] at 112~.
   Reebok International dropped ~ to 11[. On Friday the company
projected lower earnings for the third quarter and the year.
   CSX jumped 3} to 30|. The company announced a restructuring
program that includes the planned repurchase of as many as 60
million shares, or about 38 percent of the total outstanding.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.40 to 151.39. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 1.31 at 296.91.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 69.80 million shares at
noontime, down from 104.42 million at the same point Friday.

<HEAD>Rig Count Dips by 17 Amid Preparations for Hurricane Gilbert</HEAD>

   The number of working oil and gas rigs showed the
biggest single-week decline since mid-July, dropping by 17 to total
921 as production was partially interrupted by preparations for
Hurricane Gilbert, Baker Hughes Inc. reports.
   It was the lowest level reported since the count reached 894 on
Aug. 1, Baker Hughes economist Ike Kerridge said Monday.
   The dip in the number of working Texas rigs centered in the
state's Gulf Coast region, signaling that weather played a factor
in the lower numbers, Kerridge said. The count probably would have
plunged still lower if a more accurate method were available for
recording offshore rig evacuations, he added.
   ``The offshore count really does not reflect the shortened rig
count in the gulf due to Hurricane Gilbert,'' Kerridge said. ``Our
feeling, from what we have heard, is that most of the rigs in the
gulf were shut down at least a few days.''
   The count had increased by five in last week's tally to total
938, halting a month-long trend of small declines.
   Baker Hughes' rig count, the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity, reflects the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the number of working rigs since 1940.
   The rig count reached a peak of 4,500 active rigs in December
1981, which was the height of the oil boom. But oil prices plunged
to less than $10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 and the
rig count went with it, dropping to 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   The lowest level this year was the reported 880 rigs on May 2.
   Among major oil producing states, Louisiana had 11 fewer working
rigs, followed by Texas, 10; Wyoming, four; Oklahoma, three; and
Kansas, which declined by one.
   North Dakota and Pennsylvania both increased by four working
rigs, while Ohio gained three and Colorado, California and New
Mexico added two apiece. Michigan gained one.
   Although Texas declines primarily were reported along the coast,
Kerridge said Louisiana's were scattered throughout the state.

<HEAD>The Fantastic Social Security Surplus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For a nation accustomed to enormous debts in its
consumer, business and government sectors, the idea of
trillion-dollar Social Security surpluses tends to sound like a
financial fairy tale.
   The idea of a surplus anywhere in Uncle Sam's books would be
hard to accept, but to believe that it will appear in the Social
Security account, just recently rescued from insolvency, sounds
utterly implausible.
   But implausibility gets strained further. The surplus talked
about is in amounts almost incomprehensible, not just to ordinary
folks who have a difficult time adjusting to millions of dollars,
but even to actuaries.
   As calculated by the Social Security Administration, the surplus
could grow to $12 trillion in about 40 years. And, since the
surplus would have to be invested in Treasury securities, it might
absorb the entire national debt.
   The scenario becomes more incredible. With the federal deficit
vanished, a string of surplus years might occur in the next
century, forcing interest rates down and conceivably spurring or
retarding economic growth.
   But there is another side to the story, too, and it adds to the
incredible nature of this financial phenomenon. Is it possible for
highly trained actuaries to make multitrillion-dollar errors? Could
all this be a dream?
   There are those who say it is. Writing for the Heritage
Foundation, a conservative think tank, Professor Peter J. Ferrara
of George Mason Law School calls the projections the great Social
Security surplus hoax.
   ``The trouble is that there is and will be no cash mountain,''
he says. ``Those who think there will be have been misreading U.S.
government Social Security projections and do not understand
federal budget accounting.''
   A study by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, a securities firm,
questions some underlying assumptions. It claims estimates are
based on an absence of recessions, mortality rates that improve too
slowly and an uninterrupted, and unlikely, increase in real wages
of 1.4 percent a year.
   In fact, the Social Security Administration itself offers a
pessimistic scenario of slow growth and relatively high inflation
that has the surplus peaking at $3.3 trillion in 2015, rather than
at $12 trillion in the year 2030.
   That's a difference of $8.7 trillion!
   In the view of some who view the entire surplus projection as a
pipe dream, the huge range in official estimates demonstrates that
sensible people should retreat from the future to more practical
problems of the moment.
   Generally, these critics argue that the projections are based on
invalid assumptions regarding demographics, health, income,
interest rates, fertility rates and a dozen other considerations,
many of them economic and political.
   Moreover, they point out, even if the surplus does accumulate to
$12 trillion by 2030, it might all disappear in payments to
recipients over the following two decades. That is, any surplus
would be temporary.
   Still, critics say repeatedly, politicians cannot be trusted to
keep their hands off any pile of money. Inevitably, it is said,
they would devise ways to spend it. If you do not believe it, they
say, you deserve to be hoaxed.
   Not taking any chances, Howard Stein, chairman of Dreyfus Corp.,
commissioned a study of what an end to federal deficits might mean
for investors. (``To begin with, long-term bonds would appear to be
an extraordinary value.'')
   An editorial in a newsletter for investors in Dreyfus mutual
funds this month warned, ``There will be all sorts of ingenious
proposals for diverting this money to `worthy' programs ...
buttressed by equally ingenious arguments.''
   It reminded readers: ``It really isn't the government's money.
It belongs to every working American man and woman, today and in
the future.'' It suggested they be vigilant.

<TEXT>
   Prices on the London Stock Exchange fell during a
subdued session Monday, with little corporate or economic news to
influence trading.
   Dealers said Wall Street's slide pulled London equities somewhat
lower in the last hour of trading.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index closed down
6.8 points, or 0.4 percent, at 1,759.9.
   Volume was modest, as 326.7 million shares changed hands,
compared with 396.5 million shares traded Friday.
   The Dow Jones industrial average was off 27.20 points at
2,070.95 as London trading subsided. British equities were able to
shake off most of Wall Street's slide as speculative situations
supported London prices, traders said.
   Traders also said players appeared hesitant to commit themselves
ahead of Tuesday's release of British money supply data for August.

<TEXT>
   A majority of Americans believe immigrants
have a negative impact on the economy, and almost half said the
newcomers contribute little to American culture, according to a
poll published today.
   ``A lot of our old prejudices are still at work,'' said Maurice
A. Roberts, editor of Interpreter Releases, a Washington-based
national immigration journal, said of the Los Angeles Times poll.
   The poll surveyed 1,418 people nationwide last weekend, four
months after the one-year immigrant legalization program ended and
two months after the government began full enforcement of sanctions
against employers who hire illegal aliens.
   Asked whether immigrants get more or less from the U.S economy
through social services and unemployment benefits than they
contribute through taxes and work, 64 percent of the respondents
said immigrants take more than they give.
   Nineteen percent said immigrants contributed more, while 4
percent said immigrants benefited and contributed equally to the
economy. The rest of the respondents had no clear opinion,
according to the poll.
   Asked whether immigrants have made a contribution in the last
decade to American culture, 46 percent said they haven't, while 40
percent said immigrants have enriched the culture. The rest had no
clear opinion.
   The margin of error was four percentage points in either
direction.

<TEXT>
   Pillsbury Co. announced Monday the sale of
its Godfather's Pizza unit to the restaurant division's management.
   Terms of the agreement were not announced, Pillsbury said in a
prepared statement.
   Godfather's Pizza, which will remain based in Omaha, Neb., has
542 restaurants, 178 of which are company-owned. It is the nation's
fifth-largest pizza restaurant chain.
   The management group, led by its president, Herman Cain, began
negotiations with Pillsbury last March, when the parent company
announced its desire to sell the Omaha-based restaurant chain.
   Godfather's Pizza was founded in Omaha by Willy Theisen in 1973
and sold its first franchise a year later.
   Godfather's became a public company in 1982 and a year later
merged with Chart House Inc. to form DiversiFoods Inc., a
Chicago-based restaurant concern which included 377 Burger King
stores.
   At its peak in 1984, Godfather's had 911 restaurants generating
$365 million in annual sales.
   Pillsbury acquired Diversifoods in 1985, primarily for its
Burger King franchises.
   Cain, who served as vice president of Burger King's Philadelphia
region since 1983, was appointed president of Godfather's in 1986.

   Soybean futures closed sharply lower Monday on
the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting disappointment in the lack
of foreign and domestic demand, analysts said. Grain futures prices
also declined.
   Soybean contracts for September and January delivery traded down
the permitted limit of 30 cents a bushel during the session but
recovered slightly before the close.
   ``A lot of bulls are throwing in the towel, backing away from
the market,'' said Mario Balletto, soybean market analyst in New

   ``There's no buying showing up from users,'' he said. ``That's
still the big lament in the market.''
   Three soybean meal contracts closed down the $10-a-ton limit for
that market. The September contract, which has no limit, closed
down $12.80 at $261 a ton.
   At the close, wheat was 1 cent to 6 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.97 a bushel; corn was 2
cents to 6} cents lower with September at $2.72 a bushel; oats were
3{ cents to 6\ cents lower with September at $2.54 a bushel;
soybeans were 15\ cents to 27{ cents lower with September at $8.20

<HEAD>Dollar Falls Slightly; Gold Prices Continue Slide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar drifted lower Monday in slow European
trading, reflecting dealer reluctance to speculate in advance of
meetings by the International Monetary Fund and Group of Seven
finance ministers this week.
   Gold slid lower, persisting in a slide that has pushed prices to
the lowest levels since early last year.
   The dollar's performance might ``be repeated every day this
week,'' one dealer said.
   The IMF and World Bank are to begin a meeting on international
debt in West Berlin on Thursday. In addition, the G-7 finance
ministers are to hold a meeting of their own there on Saturday to
discuss economic policy.
   The G-7 industrialized nations are the United States, West
Germany, Japan, France, Great Britain, Italy and Canada.
   Dealers will watch both meetings for a change in direction for
the dollar.
   The dollar's failure to rally last week after the release of
strong U.S. trade figures has left the market confused, dealers
said. Few want to sell the U.S. currency and few want to buy, they
said.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar inched up 0.04 yen to a closing 133.80 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 133.90 yen.
   In London, the dollar fell slightly against the British pound.
It cost $1.6785 to buy one pound, little changed from $1.6758 late
Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday
included: 1.8695 West German marks, down from 1.8763; 1.5793 Swiss
francs, down from 1.5835; 6.3520 French francs, down from 6.3795;
2.1100 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1151; 1,393.50 Italian lire,
down from 1,398.50; 1.2194 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2232.
   Gold continued its slide from last week, reaching a morning low
of $405 a troy ounce in Zurich, before hectic buying helped the
metal regain some lost ground.
   Gold finished lower in Zurich, closing at $408.50 compared with
$411.00 late Friday.
   In London, gold fell to $409.30 a troy ounce, compared with late
Friday's $412.00.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell $3.07 to close at $411.40.
   Silver bullion prices fell on the London market where the metal
was trading at $6.28 a troy ounce, compared with $6.40 Friday.

   Compaq Computer Corp., continuing its market
battle with industry giant IBM, announced Monday a smaller,
full-power desktop computer in its growing line of products.
   The Compaq Deskpro 386-20e offers more standard features than
the company's larger 386-based personal computers in a smaller
package, said Compaq President Rod Canion.
   The unit is being aimed at users of 286-based personal computers
who need a faster, compatible unit. It is also being introduced in
direct competition with International Business Machines Corp.'s
Personal System-2 Model 70-121, which is comparably sized and
priced, Compaq said.
   The Deskpro incorporates Compaq's Flex architecture in a smaller
form, offering compatibility with the industry standard while
running 25 percent faster than the IBM PS-2 Model 70-121, Canion
said.
   The models range in price from $5,199 to $7,999.
   The 386 is short for the 80386, Intel Corp.'s most powerful
microprocessor and the successor to the Intel 80286.

   Apple Computer Inc. announced Monday a new

runs 10 percent to 15 percent faster.
   Even though the new computer uses a different microprocessor _
Motorola Inc.'s 68030 microprocessor instead of the older 68020 _
it runs virtually all software written for the Mac II, Apple said.
   The Macintosh II has gained a bigger foothold in business than
earlier Apple machines. The Wall Street Journal said Monday that
some features of the Mac IIx suggest it could compete with a
computer scheduled to be introduced Oct. 12 by Next Inc., which is
headed by Steven Jobs, the co-founder and former chairman of Apple.
   Suggested retail prices of the Mac IIx, which is scheduled to be
available next month, range from $7,769 to $9,369.

Unisys customers to other makers of big computers, particularly
International Business Machines Corp., said Jay Stevens, an analyst
for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   The new machines are the successors to the 1100-90 computers of
Sperry Corp., which Burroughs Corp. took over two years ago to form
Unisys.
   The 1100 series is a favorite with banks and airlines, both of
which are heavy users of a style of computing called on-line
transaction processing. Unisys said it could achieve an
industry-best 6,500 transactions per second by closely tying
together four computers, each containing four processors.
   Unisys said the 2200-600 computers complete the renewal of the
1100 line, which it promised at the time of the Burroughs-Sperry
merger.
   The computers use semiconductors and packaging technology from
Hitachi Ltd., but Unisys said it intends eventually to drop its
reliance on the Japanese company.
   Prices range from $2 million for a base model to $29 million for
the model capable of 6,500 transactions per second, Unisys said.
The computers will be available next year between March and June.
   The new software for transaction processing runs on the old as
well as the new machines.

   New York, New England and Southern California have
the highest ratio of housing costs to wages in the nation and are
facing severe labor shortage because of it, a new study shows.
   While American business is spending billions to help house its
workers, it also is being impelled to join the lobby for federally
sponsored housing reform, which promises to be a major business
concern of the 1990s, according to the study published in the
Harvard Business Review.
   Some of the effects of the crunch include companies abandoning
big cities, managers refusing transfers from places like Denver and
Houston to Boston or San Francisco, and unions fighting for wage
increases tied to the cost of housing.
   ``The housing shortage continues to drive up wages, drain the
work force of every region it afflicts, and force businesses to
pour capital into ballooning recruitment and relocation budgets,''
said the study, which appears in the magazine's September-October
issue.
   Calculating an ``affordability ratio'' of housing prices to
wages, the study found that Boston; Anaheim, Calif.; Hartford,
Conn.; New York; Providence, R.I.; and San Francisco are the
least-affordable places in the country to live.
   In Boston, the median 1987 price of a single-family home was
$177,200, while the average annual wage was $23,148, for a ratio of
7.7. That makes housing unaffordable, according to the study, since
a household would need an income of $59,449 to buy the average
house.
   The average national ratio was 4.2 _ $85,600 for the house with
a $20,615 income. But a family still would need $28,718 to afford
the payments.
   Consequently, businesses in high-cost housing regions are
spending billions of dollars to finance employee mortgages,
relocate workers around the country and subsidize incomes to help
meet housing costs, the study found.
   Often, companies just can't lure people to work in places with
expensive housing, the study said.
   ``Many big- and middle-sized firms around the country are having
a difficult time attracting employees,'' Peter Dreier, housing
director for the Boston Redevelopment Authority and one of the
study's authors, said Monday.
   ``An engineer who sells his three-bedroom house for $80,000 and
moves to the East or West coast finds that for that money he can
maybe get a one-bedroom condominium.''
   Dreier said 75 percent of Boston-area employers recently
interviewed had raised wages or benefits beyond inflation
adjustments because of the city's housing woes. A new contract for
the local hotel and restaurant workers' union ties wages to housing
costs rather than consumer prices.
   The single-family house price in greater Boston is the nation's
third highest behind Honolulu and New York, and rents average more
than $800 a month for a two-bedroom apartment, a more than 25
percent increase since 1981, the study said.
   In the San Francisco Bay area, only 15 percent of households
could afford the 1987 median single-family home of $171,400 and
rents rose over 25 percent from 1981-86. The situation is similar
in Anaheim, San Diego and Los Angeles, the report said.
   ``It's a very serious problem in the Bay Area,'' said Stephen
Barton, a housing policy analyst with the Bay Area Council, a
business-sponsored civic group concerned with housing, employment
and transportation.
   To help fight the trend, San Francisco companies have worked
with the nonprofit Bridge Housing Corporation to create more than
3,000 units of housing in five years valued at $238 million.
   But in the New York City area alone last year, Mobil Oil,
International Paper Co., J.C. Penny Co. Inc. and Lillian Vernon
Corp. all announced they were moving, taking almost 4,000 jobs from
the area. The Grumman Corp. opened new engineering centers in Texas
and Florida instead of near its Bethpage, L.I., headquarters
because of high suburban housing prices.
   A high-technology research consortium earlier this year cited
housing as a reason for locating a $1.5 billion semiconductor
research project in Austin, Texas, instead of greater Boston.
   The study criticizes the Reagan administration for slashing the
federal housing-assistance budget 75 percent since 1980, to $8
billion from $33 billion. It says American business ``has
shouldered much of the housing burden'' and calls for corporate
leaders to lobby Congress for a comprehensive housing policy for
the rest of the century.
   Said Dreier, ``Business needs to pay attention to housing not
out of a sense of do-gooderism or civic pride but out of concern
for their own bottom line.''

<HEAD>Rales Group Assails Interco Resistance, Warns of `Unfortunate
Consequences'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An investor group trying to acquire Interco Inc.
for $2.6 billion warned the manufacturing company Monday of
``unfortunate consequences'' if it proceeds with an anti-takeover
restructuring that includes asset sales.
   ``You have refused to communicate with us concerning our
interest in acquiring Interco for nearly two months,'' complained
Steven and Mitchell Rales, the brothers who lead the takeover
group, Cardinal Acquisition Corp., in a letter to Interco's board.
The letter was released publicly.
   It was the Rales' response to an Interco filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission last week in which the St.
Louis-based company disclosed the possibility of a defensive
restructuring to thwart an unsolicited takeover.
   Interco said it had retained a group of unidentified bankers to
explore how to finance the restructuring, which could include the
sale of assets such as the company's Ethan Allen furniture concern.
   Such a move could make Interco, a diversified manufacturer with
products that also include London Fog raincoats and Florsheim
shoes, an unattractive acquisition target to the Rales brothers,
Washington-based investors known for their takeover forays.
   Their letter assailed what they called Interco's ``vague
references to a `recapitalization plan' which to date is only
mythical. Not once have you provided stockholders with any
information concerning timing or value.''
   The letter also reiterated that the Rales group's $70-a-share
offer is good only for the company in its present form.
   ``In order to avoid any unfortunate consequences should you
decide to pursue asset sales, we expect to be consulted well in
advance so that we can evaluate the effect that any such sale would
have on our offer,'' the letter stated. ``In addition, we wish to
participate in any such sale process with a full and fair
opportunity to bid.''
   The group did not elaborate on the meaning of ``unfortunate
consequences,'' but presumably was warning of legal action or a
shareholder proxy fight to block any restructuring that would spoil
its strategy.
   Interco spokesman David Garino said the company had no comment
on the Rales letter.
   The Rales group first moved to acquire Interco in late July, but
the company has repeatedly rejected the overtures. The group owns
about 8.7 percent of Interco's 38.4 million shares outstanding.

<TEXT>
   The government said Monday it had
approved a joint venture that will permit the sale of the soft
drink Pepsi-Cola in India.
   Food Processing Minister Jagdish Tytler said the project, which
also envisions production of food products, was cleared after a
meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs.
   Pepsico Inc., which makes Pepsi soft drinks and Frito-Lay snack
foods, said from its headquarters in Somers, N.Y. that it first
proposed a joint venture to the Indian government more than three
years ago.
   Its partners in the deal are the Punjab government's
Agro-Industries Corp. and the Tata group, one of India's largest
industrial companies.
   The agreement calls for an initial investment totaling $17
million.
   The project involves setting up agro-research facilities, a
potato and grain processing plant, a fruit and vegetable processing
unit and a plant to manufacture soft-drink concentrate.
   In its announcement, Pepsico said the research facilities will
be used to develop high-yield crops and disease-resistant seed
varieties.
   It said the potato and grain processing plant will make snack
foods for local consumption, while the fruit and vegetable
processing plant will manufacture fruit juice concentrates and
tomato paste, mainly for export.
   Soft drink manufacture will occur locally through a group of
franchised bottlers, which will be supplied by an Indian plant that
produces soft drink concentrate, Pepsico said.
   Pepsico's share in the project is pegged at 39.9 percent, in
compliance with a law that limits foreign involvement in a joint
project to 40 percent.
   The project is to be based in the northern state of Punjab, a
rich farming state which has seen its once-booming economy
shattered by six years of guerrilla warfare by Sikh extremists and
has been desperate to lure new industry.
   Tytler said the project would create 50,000 jobs in India, of
which more than half would be in Punjab.
   Indians were cut off from foreign-made sodas in 1977 when
Coca-Cola Co. pulled out rather than follow a government directive
to dilute its ownership and reveal its secret formula.
   Last year, Double Cola Co. from Chattanooga, Tenn., was allowed
to sell in India under a special program to encourage investment
from non-resident Indians. Indian businessmen based in London
secured the government's approval and have opened three plants.
   Pepsico will have to comply with some exacting conditions of the
Indian government.
   The soft-drink production will be restricted to 25 percent of
the project's sales and exports of food products will have to be
five times the value of imports.
   The proposal was stalled for over two years by opposition
politicians and domestic bottlers.
   Chandra Shekhar, leader of the opposition Janata Party,
describes the Pepsi plan as ``a diabolical attempt to abandon the
chosen path of self-reliance.''
   George Fernandes, also of the Janata Party, said in a statement
that his party would ``physically prevent the installation of
facilities to produce Pepsi in the country.''
   Domestic Indian soda-manufacturers had also tried to block
Pepsi's entry into India. ``We are a poor country, and we need to
develop industry _ our own industry _ and this is not the way,''
Ramesh Chauhan, owner of India's largest soda-maker, Parle Exports
Private Ltd., said in an interview last year.
   Parle is estimated to control 60 percent of India's $460 million
annual market for soft drinks and will probably be the hardest-hit
by the entry of Pepsi into India.
   But Pepsi officials say their aim is to stimulate demand to
double its present size and carve out a share of the increased
market.
   There was no indication whether Pepsi would be able to use its
brand name while marketing its cola. The monthly India Today
magazine said in a recent article that the name Pepsi-Cola would
``give it an obvious advantage over local brands and (be) .. too
much a symbol of multinational neo-colonialism.''

   Stock prices turned downward in quiet trading
Monday, giving up some of last week's gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 29.34 points last
week, fell 17.07 to 2,081.08.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
584 up, 885 down and 472 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 135.77 million
shares, down from 211.11 million Friday, when the total was
inflated by futures-related trading at the so-called triple
witching hour.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 159.05 million shares.
   Last week, the market extended an advance it began in late
August with a lift from fresh evidence that economic growth was
slowing to a moderate pace.
   The government reported a larger-than-expected decline in the
nation's trade deficit for July as imports slowed.
   Most analysts agree that the recent slackening in the pace of
business activity has at least postponed any further moves by the
Federal Reserve to tighten credit.
   But some argue that the central bank will nevertheless have to
take further steps sooner or later in its avowed mission to keep
inflationary pressures from reviving.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down 1{ at 112}; General Electric, down [ at 43[; Exxon,

   Reebok International dropped ~ to 11[. On Friday the company
projected lower earnings for the third quarter and the year.
   CSX jumped 3} to 30|. The company announced a restructuring
program that includes the planned repurchase of as many as 60

   Elsewhere, news and rumors of possible takeovers continued to
set a lively pace in an otherwise uninspired market.
   Kroger rose 1} to 52}. The company said it had been approached
by Dart Group with a merger proposal under which Kroger holders
would receive about $55 a share in cash and securities.
   Time Inc., which has been rumored since late last week to have

and buyouts, gained 9| to 116\.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000

percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .87 to 151.92.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index fell 2.36 to 308.45, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index was down 1.83 at 268.82.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market

   CSX Corp. said Monday it would buy back up
to 60 million of its common shares and sell off two natural gas
units in a billion-dollar restructuring that will allow the company
to concentrate on its transportation business.
   CSX said it would begin repurchasing shares this week through a
``Dutch auction,'' in which shareholders are invited to offer their
holdings at a price between $28 and $33 per share. The company will
choose one price and purchase up to 40 million shares offered at or
below that price.
   Depending on market conditions, the remainder of the 60 million
shares would be purchased on the open market or in private
negotiations, officials said.
   At $33 a share, the restructuring would cost CSX a total of
$1.98 billion.
   Investors reacted enthusiastically to the CSX announcement, and
bid the company's stock up $3.75 a share to $30.50 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Wall Street analysts said the proposal would benefit CSX
shareholders.
   ``It's extremely positive,'' said transportation analyst Jeff
Medford at Wheat First Securities Inc. in Richmond. Reducing the
number of shares outstanding would make the return for stockholders
substantially higher, Medford said.
   The restructuring indicated CSX management is concerned about
generating revenue for stockholders, a change from its apparent
position in the past several years, Medford said.
   Medford said he believes the true market value of CSX is higher
than its current trading price, but he said the company should have
no problem finding takers for its buy-back offer.
   ``Most institutions have been disappointed with CSX's operating
performance,'' he said.
   CSX stock prices have been lagging at about 25 percent below
their pre-October 1987 price, while the market as a whole is only
about 10 or 11 percent below its pre-crash value, according to
analyst Andrew Geller of Provident National Bank in Philadelphia.
   Medford said the company had the cash available to buy back the
shares without selling assets, but he called the planned sale of
CSX's natural gas transmission and natural gas liquids processing
businesses, Texas Gas Transmission Corp. of Owensboro, Ky. and CSX
NGL Corp. of Houston, a sound business move.
   The restructuring continues CSX's moves over the past year to
reduce costs by making payroll cuts and selling assets, Geller
said. CSX said it will considering selling additional assets such
as its luxury resort properties and will launch ``an aggressive
program designed to significantly reduce operating and overhead
costs.''
   Hays T. Watkins, CSX chairman and chief executive officer, said
the restructuring ``evidences our continued commitment to
increasing stockholder value by concentrating our resources on our
core transportation businesses.''
   Medford attributed the change in direction of CSX's management
to John Snow, president and chief operating officer.
   The Richmond-based CSX is the parent company of CSX
Transportation, CSX Energy, CSX Properties and CSX Technology.

   The dollar weakened marginally Monday in scanty
trading, reflecting currency-dealer reluctance to do much business
ahead of some potentially significant meetings and economic reports.
   Gold prices eroded further, persisting in a slide that has
pushed bullion to the lowest levels in about 18 months. Republic
National Bank of New York quoted gold at $409.20 a troy ounce as of
4 p.m. EDT, down $2.55 from Friday.
   Foreign exchange brokers said a spate of possibly market-moving
news expected during the week incited a cautious attitude toward
the dollar.
   Aside from meetings planned by the International Monetary Fund,
World Bank and the finance ministers of leading industrialized
democracies, the United States will report a final revision of
second-quarter economic growth and the August rate of inflation. In
addition, Japan will report a range of economic statistics and
Britain will report its money supply growth figures.
   ``There seems to be a thousand reasons not to trade, and that
seems to be what happened,'' said John Baker, chief dealer at the
New York branch of Bank Julius Baer & Co.
   Some dealers said they were growing pessimistic about the
dollar's ability to strengthen. They said the currency's failure to
appreciate sharply in the aftermath of a large reduction in the
U.S. monthly trade deficit reported last week was viewed as a
reason to start selling dollars.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.04 yen to 133.80 yen. Later in
London it was quoted at a higher rate of 133.90 yen. But by the
time trading ended in New York the dollar weakened to 133.54 yen,
compared with 134.12 yen level Friday.
   The British pound strengthened slightly against the dollar in
London, to $1.6785 from $1.6758. Later in New York sterling fetched
$1.6787, unchanged from Friday.
   Other late-dollar rates in New York vs. levels late Friday:
1.8677 West German marks, down from 1.8711; 1.5780 Swiss francs,
down from 1.5808; 1.2189 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2232; 6.3495
French francs, down from 6.3630; and 1,391.75 Italian lire, down
from 1,399.00.
   Other late-dollar rates in Europe vs. levels late Friday: 1.8695
marks, down from 1.8763; 1.5793 Swiss francs, down from 1.5835;
6.3520 French francs, down from 6.3795; 2.1100 Dutch guilders, down
from 2.1151; 1,393.50 Italian lire, down from 1,398.50; 1.2194
Canadian dollars, down from 1.2232.
   Gold continued to weaken, reflecting what dealers called
investor disillusionment with the metal's value as a hedge against
inflation.
   ``I think basically we have an exhausted market in which there's
no buying, so any metal that comes into the market isn't finding
receptive buyers,'' said Jeffrey Nichols, head of American Precious
Metals Advisers, a New York-based consulting concern. ``There's
nothing particularly unusual that went on today except for more of
the same pessimism.''
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
fell $2.50 a troy ounce to $409.20. Earlier, gold fell $3.07 in
Hong Kong to $441.40; in Zurich it fell $2.50 to $408.50; and in
London it fell $2.70 to $409.30.
   Silver for current delivery rose 4.4 cents on the New York Comex
to $6.37 a troy ounce. Earlier in London, silver slid 12 cents to
$6.28.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Dive On Lack Of Demand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices fell sharply Monday on the Chicago Board
of Trade, reflecting disappointment in the lack of foreign and
domestic demand, analysts said. Grain futures prices also declined.
   On other markets, gold and platinum futures retreated while
silver rallied; energy futures rose; livestock and meat were mixed;
and stock-index futures advanced.
   Several soybean contracts traded down the permitted limit of 30
cents a bushel during the session but recovered slightly before the
close. Prices ended at their lowest levels since Aug. 23.
   ``A lot of bulls are throwing in the towel, backing away from
the market,'' said Mario Balletto, soybean market analyst in New
York with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.
   ``There's no buying showing up from users,'' he said. ``That's
still the big lament in the market.''
   Mickey Luth, soybean analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in
Chicago, termed export sales and shipments ``lousy,'' adding that
the soybean market was beginning to feel pressure from the
advancing harvest.
   More soybeans usually come to market at harvest-time as farmers
and grain handlers clean out their bins to make room for the new
crop.
   Luth said the soybean market's recent pattern of long, slow
rallies followed by sharp breaks was typical of tight-supply years.
The Agriculture Department expects soybean production this year to
be 23 percent below last year's level.
   The market has been trading in a broad range from $8 to $10 a
bushel and is unlikely to go higher barring major problems with the
Brazilian soybean crop, he said.
   Corn and wheat futures followed the soybean market but losses in
wheat were limited by talk of new export business with Morocco and
Algeria, analysts said.
   The USDA confirmed after the close it had accepted bids from
exporters on sales of 100,000 metric tons of subsidized wheat to
Morocco and 50,000 metric tons to Algeria.
   Wheat settled 1{ cents to 6} cents lower with the contract for
delivery in September at $3.96\ a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 7{
cents lower with September at $2.71\ a bushel; oats were 4 cents to
6{ cents lower with September at $2.52 a bushel; soybeans were 12}
cents to 28{ cents lower with September at $8.21 a bushel.
   Gold futures prices declined for the fourth straight day on New
York's Commodity Exchange and posted new 18-month lows.
   But gold appeared ``oversold'' from a technical standpoint, said
Stephen Platt, an analyst in Chicago with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``It looks like you've basically exhausted the downside momentum
for now,'' he said.
   Precious metals futures all opened lower on Monday but drew
support from a late firming of crude oil prices, Platt said. Silver
closed higher, gold finished slightly lower and platinum was down
sharply.
   The platinum market ``seemed like it finally caught up with some
of the weakness in both gold and silver,'' he said.
   Platinum, traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, settled
$13.10 to $14.90 lower with October at $503 a troy ounce.
   Gold settled $2.70 to $3.10 lower with October at $410.20 a troy
ounce; silver was 0.5 cent to 3.5 cents higher with September at
$6.37 a pound.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate
crude oil settled 7 cents lower to 16 cents higher with October at
$14.73 a barrel; heating oil was .01 cent lower to .12 cent higher
with October at 41.36 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .25
cent lower to .15 cent higher with October at 44.24 cents a gallon.
   Live cattle prices were mostly lower, with October and December
deliveries hardest hit, in response to Friday's monthly USDA
cattle-on-feed report.
   The report showed fewer marketings and fewer cattle placed on
feedlots during August than the futures market had expected. The
numbers suggested supplies of slaughter-ready cattle would remain
plentiful through the end of the year, then tighten a bit early
next year.
   Hog futures also wee mixed, partly in anticipation of the USDA's
quarterly hogs and pigs report, which will be released Sept. 30,
analysts said, while frozen pork bellies declined in a technical
sell-off.
   Live cattle settled .35 cent lower to .10 cent higher with
October at 69 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .55
cent higher with September at 79.85 cents a pound; hogs were .30
cent lower to .27 cent higher with October at 37.67 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .70 cent to 1.20 cents lower with February
at 49.52 cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures advanced slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, with the contract for December delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settling .20 point higher at 271.85 points.

<TEXT>
   The directors of Phoenix-based Ramada Inc. have
rejected a $368 million takeover offer by the owners of the Hyatt
hotel chain.
   The 10-member board met for more than four hours on Friday
before announcing the offer by HCC Corp. of Chicago, a Hyatt
affiliate, was ``not in the best interests of Ramada and its
shareholders,'' Ramada spokesman Joe Cole said.
   Jay Pritzker, HCC president, had given Ramada until the close of
business Friday to respond to his corporation's offer of $10 a
share for all stockholders other than HCC.
   The Ramada board based its decision in part on an opinion of
Salomon Brothers Inc., a New York-based financial adviser, that
HCC's proposal was ``grossly inadequate and unfair from a financial
point of view,'' Cole said.
   Ramada operates or franchises the operation of more than 600
hotels under the Ramada and Rodeway chains, runs several casinos
through its Gaming Group and is entering the mid-priced,
family-dining market with Marie Callender's restaurants.
   Ramada stock closed at $10 a share Monday, unchanged from
Friday's price, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

<TEXT>
   KDI Corp. said Monday its board was
considering the possible sale of the diversified manufacturer to a
management-led investor group for about $185 million.
   Eugene A. Cafiero, KDI's chairman and chief executive officer,
heads the group that is exploring whether to purchase the
diversified Cincinnati-based manufacturer for $19 a share.
   At the end of August, KDI had 9.7 million shares outstanding,
which at $19 a share would place the purchase offer at almost $185
million.
   KDI stock closed at $17.87{ a share, up 37{ cents, in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading Monday.
   Ariadne Australia Ltd. of Sidney, Australia, owns 49.7 percent
of KDI, enough for a controlling interest in the company. The
Australian business began considering in May whether to sell its
shares, leading Cafiero and his group to express their interest in
a buyout of KDI.
   Cafiero and his group said their willingness to purchase KDI
required execution of definitive agreements no later than Wednesday
morning.
   Cafiero, former chairman and president of Chrysler Corp., became
KDI president in October 1986.
   His success in turning the company around during 1987 was
reflected in its sales, which increased 11 percent from the
previous year to $314.4 million.
   Income for the company, whose products include swimming pools
and chemicals, jumped 189 percent to $18.8 million.

<HEAD>Time Stock Up Again, Says Has No Plans for Buyout or Other
Transaction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time Inc.'s share price climbed another 9
percent Monday, boosting its rise over the past two sessions to
more than 19 percent, on buyout and restructuring speculation about
the media and entertainment giant.
   After the market closed, the company broke with its policy
against commenting on market rumors, and said it ``is not
considering a leveraged buyout or any other transaction that could
account for its price rise.''
   Time advanced $9.62{ a share to $116.25 in trading on the New
York Stock Exchange, following a $9.37{ a share rise last Friday.
   Last Friday, the company said it knew of no reason for the rise
in its stock price, but declined to comment on any of the assorted
rumors that swirled through the market.
   Among the rumors, analysts said, were that Time was considering
a restructuring or a management-led buyout, might sell part of its
operations or could become a takeover target.
   But some analysts also said the stock may be benefitting from
conjecture about the recent consolidation wave in the publishing
business.
   Macmillan Inc., the textbook giant, for instance, has proposed a
management-led buyout as it tries to fend off a competing bid from
British publisher Robert Maxwell.
   After Time's stock continued to its sharp ascent in Monday's
session, the company issued this statement about an hour after the
market closed:
   ``While it is Time Inc.'s policy not to comment on market
rumors, in view of the uninformed speculation about the company in
the last two trading days, Time Inc. said today that it is not
considering a leveraged buyout or any other transaction that could
account for the rise in its stock price.''
   Time is a leading magazine and book publisher, owns the Home Box
Office pay-television service and has an 82 percent stake in
American Television and Communications Corp., a cable television
operator with about 3.78 million subscribers.
   It has about 58 million shares outstanding, and earned $150
million, or $2.58 a share, in the six months ended June 30, on
revenue of $2.17 billion.
   Based on Monday's closing price, Time would have a market value
of about $6.74 billion.

<TEXT>
   Primerica Corp., which plans to merge
with Commercial Credit Group Inc., said Monday that in light of the
proposed combination it was terminating an agreement to sell its
Pennsylvania Life Insurance Co. subsidiary.
   Primerica announced in April it had agreed in principle to sell
Santa Monica, Calif.-based Pennsylvania Life and two affiliates to
American National Insurance Co. of Galveston, Texas, for about $240
million.
   Kenneth M. Koprowski, a Primerica spokesman, said that because
Commercial Credit and Pennsylvania Life are both engaged in
financial services, it made sense to review the decision to sell
the insurance company.
   Last month, Primerica agreed to be acquired by Commercial Credit
in a $1.65 billion, mostly stock deal.
   Primerica is engaged in financial services and specialty
retailing. Its other subsidiaries include the investment firm Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co.

<HEAD>IC Industries Will Become Whitman Corp.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   IC Industries Inc. will change its name to
Whitman Corp. on Dec. 1, as part of its evolution from railroad
operator to manufacturer of consumer goods and provider of
services, officials said Monday.
   The company's current name was derived from the initials of the
Illinois Central Railroad, which IC is spinning off to its
shareholders. The new name comes from Whitman's chocolates and
frozen desserts, one of the brands of Pet Inc., IC's foods
subsidiary.
   Chicago-based IC also owns Pepsi-Cola General Bottlers; Hussman
Corp., a manufacturer of food-service equipment; and auto-repair
specialist Midas International.
   ``The decision to change our name to Whitman Corp. is another
key step in our strategic plan to sharpen our focus on consumer
goods and service,'' Karl Bays, chairman and chief executive
officer, said in a statement.
   Spokesman Charles Connolly said the company settled on Whitman
as its new name after a year of research that gave it high marks
for familiarity, quality and distinction.
   ``It's easy to say, it's easy to spell, it tests very well and
it's ours to use,'' he said.

<HEAD>Judge's Ruling On Merger Will Come Before Friday, Company Says</HEAD>

   A Houston judge said she would rule before Friday
on the state attorney general's request for an injunction to keep
Halliburton Co. from acquiring Gearhart Industries, Halliburton
officials announced Monday.
   State District Judge Sharolyn Wood set trial for 10 a.m. EDT
Wednesday, after the case was transferred from Austin to facilitate
the defendants' request for an immediate trial.
   Halliburton officials said they wanted the matter settled before
Friday, when some Gearhart creditors have the right to withdraw
their consent to the merger, which could force the oil well
evaluation and geophysical services company into bankruptcy.
   The state attorney general's office obtained a temporary
restraining order last week, temporarily blocking the acquisition
valued at about $300 million.
   Gearhart officials at the company's Fort Worth headquarters,
speaking at a special meeting of the board of directors, reaffirmed
their belief that the terms of the proposed merger with Halliburton
are in the best interests of the company and its shareholders.
   The Gearhart officials also told board members they were
confident Wood would allow the merger.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Monday ordered the L'Oreal
cosmetic company to pay $2.1 million to an Illinois hair care
business for copyright infringement, and barred the French
corporation from selling its ``ZAZU'' line of products in the
United States.
   ``We're happy to have this verdict,'' said James FitzGibbon, the
attorney for Zazu Designs, a Hinsdale, Ill.-based hair salon that
also manufacturers and sells hair care products. ``This was a case
where the evidence unquestionably supported the findings.''
   In a 26-page decision, U.S. District Judge Prentice Marshall
ruled that Paris-based L'Oreal ``took an arbitrary, exciting mark
which belonged to plaintiff and destroyed it.
   ``It regarded plaintiff (Zazu) as a small town nuisance,''
Marshall said.
   He ordered L'Oreal to pay Zazu Designs $100,000 for lost
profits, $1 million to help the firm restore the trademark and $1
million in punitive damages.
   The judge also ordered L'Oreal to stop selling its ZAZU products
and ordered the firm to remove them from store shelves around the
country.
   Neither L'Oreal officials nor their attorneys could be reached
for comment on the ruling Monday night. No one answered at the
offices of the company's New York attorney, Russell Falconer.
   L'Oreal had moved to dismiss the case on grounds that it was not
subject to the jurisdiction of the northern Illinois district
court, Marshall noted. But he said the motion was denied because
``defendant (L`Oreal) is present in this district and has committed
the wrongful acts attributed to it in this district.''
   Zazu Designs Hair Salon was founded in 1979 by Raymond Koubek
and Salvatore Segretto and the name was registered with Illinois
authorities.
   The store quickly became known in the Chicago area, and its
revenue increased from $40,000 the first year to $450,000 in 1986
and $600,000 in 1987, according to court documents.
   ``Koubek and Segretto represent the great American dream,''
Marshall wrote in his decision. ``They have taken their skills,
undergone extensive training and emerged as very successful
entrepreneurs in a highly competitive business.''
   In 1985, Koubek and Segretto began selling hair care products
bearing the ZAZU trademark, the same year L'Oreal began planning
its line of hair cosmetics. A year later, L'Oreal chose ZAZU as the
name for its new products, court records showed.
   In their investigation into whether the trademark was available,
L'Oreal officials called Zazu Designs but did not speak to the two
owners. All that was asked was whether ZAZU products were sold at
the store, the judge said.
   ``The investigation was perfunctory, cursory, and of little or
no value,'' Marshall said. ``Plaintiff (Zazu) was looked upon as a
nettlesome fly to be brushed aside despite the fact that it had
registered the mark ZAZU in the very industry that defendant
intended to enter under that identical name.''
