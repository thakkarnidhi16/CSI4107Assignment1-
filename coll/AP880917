   Organizers of a rodeo for homosexuals on
Friday accused officials of the University of Nevada-Reno officials
of bowing to public pressure and using a contract dispute to cancel
the contest.
   In August, the university's Lawlor Events Center canceled the
contract to rent out its stadium Oct. 21-23 for the international
championship gay rodeo, in which top riders from regional gay
rodeos compete.
   ``I think it is just an excuse on the part of Lawlor to prevent
these types of events from coming to the facility,'' attorney Rod
Sumpter told a Washoe District Court judge.
   Don Klasic, general counsel for the university and Lawlor,
denied the charge, telling the judge, ``It has always been a
contract action. This is not a civil rights action.''
   On Sept. 1, the International Gay Rodeo and the Silver State Gay
Rodeo associations sued UNR, which oversees the events center on
its campus.
   The associations are seeking an injuction from Judge William
Forman to force Lawlor to rent its stadium for the gay rodeo, which
has been advertised for several months throughout the world.
   Forman said he would rule on the injuction Monday.
   Klasic told the court the contract was cancelled by Lawlor after
Aug. 15 when the gay organization failed to come up with $9,000 in
pre-payments to cover expenses for security, parking, cleanup and
other operation costs.
   He said Lawlor became concerned about the organization's ability
to pay expenses so a prepayment schedule was orally agreed to in
June.
   Les Krambeal, president of the international association, said
he only agreed to the demands because he feared Lawlor otherwise
would cancel the event. His organization paid $2,263 in prepayments
before running out of money.
   During initial contract talks in October 1987 and when the
document was signed in February 1988, Krambeal said he was told
expenses would not be due until Oct. 23.
   Sumpter said the written contract did not call for any
prepayments. Instead, it only required that $7,300 be paid up front
to rent out the stadium, which was done, he said.
   Sumpter said Lawlor used the financial concern as a way to cause
the association to violate its contract because of negative
complaints from area residents who protested similar events held in
the late 1970s and early 1980s.
   The prepayment plan was decided only after news leaked that a
gay rodeo was returning to Reno and two local business groups told
Lawlor officials that previous gay rodeo organizations didn't pay
all their bills, he said.

<TEXT>
   Left-wing guerrillas firing automatic
weapons burst into a federal court building in the town of Buga
Friday and freed five of their comrades being held for trial,
police reported.
   They said a judge's administrative assistant was taken hostage
by the gunmen and his body was found with a bullet in the head
beside a highway near the town 160 miles southwest of Bogota.
   Two of the guerrillas freed by the attackers were captured after
an hour-long pursuit, the police said. They did not report any
other casualties or give further details.
   In other developments, leftist rebels freed 22 government
soldiers and policemen captured in a raid last month and also
released two Colombian geologists seized in another attack, the
government and military announced.
   The soldiers and policemen freed Friday had been taken prisoner
Aug. 23 by guerrillas of the People's Liberation Army and the
Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces during a joint attack on the
northwestern town of Saiza.
   A statement from the office of President Virgilio Barcos said a
one-day cease-fire had been arranged so the captives could be
released in the Uraba region, about 300 miles northwest of Bogota.
   Two of the government troopers had been wounded in the rocket
and mortar attack on the police station in Saiza, Gen. Jesus Arias
said in an interview with the radio station RCN. He did not list
their conditions or elaborate.
   The two geologists released Thursday were among five who worked
with coal companies and were kidnapped Aug. 20 by rebels of another
guerrilla group, the National Liberation Army, or ELN.
   Rebels freed the two geologists in an arranged meeting with a
group of reporters in the city of Bucaramanga, 200 miles northeast
of Bogota.
   An ELN communique said the three other geologists would be
released soon, but declared the guerrillas would launch an
offensive against foreign coal-mining companies.
   Exxon and the Colombian state company Carbacol are partners in a
$3 billion surface mine near Colombia's Caribbean coast.
   ELN guerrillas have attacked oil pipelines and oil installations
operated by Occidental Petroleum Co., Shell Oil and the Colombian
state company Ecopetrol 46 times this year, according to the
government. It placed the damage at $300 million.
   A Defense Ministry communique released Friday said 1,174 people
have been killed this year in guerrilla attacks and battles between
rebels and security forces.
   It listed the slain as 499 guerrillas, 378 civilians and 297
policemen and soldiers.
   The ministry has reported 2,037 people were killed last year in
fighting involving rebels, government forces and civilians caught
in the violence.

<HEAD>Cult Film Performer Arrested for Mice-Biting Act</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An underground performer who allegedly bites the
heads off two mice in the cult film ``Mondo New York'' has been
arrested on animal cruelty charges, an ASPCA spokesman said.
   Joe Coleman, 32, a Manhattan performance artist, was taken into
custody by ASPCA agents at his Greenwich Village apartment Friday,
said Jeffrey Hon, spokesman for the American Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
   Coleman was booked at a police station on charges under the
state Agriculture and Markets Law; if convicted, he could face up
to one year in prison and a $1,000 fine per mouse, Hon said.
   ``While this one act may seem fairly insignificant, the whole
issue of animals in entertainment is not,'' said Hon. ``We're
letting people from underground acts to Hollywood producers know
they can't get away with animal cruelty.''
   Coleman was still being processed by police and could not
immediately be reached for comment.
   ``Mondo New York,'' a cult favorite which plays in weekend
midnight shows at a Greenwich Village theatre, features an
assortment of bizarre acts from the downtown Manhattan scene.
   Although the film was released earlier this summer, Coleman was
not arrested because ASPCA investigators hoped to catch him in the
act during one of his live performances, Hon said.
   Authorities have an eyewitness to Coleman's performance and
decided to arrest him after receiving a tip that he was leaving for
Europe, he said.
   In his scene, Coleman allegedly bites the heads off two mice and
spits them into the audience. According to Hon, the scene has
outraged animal rights activists, including television game show
host Bob Barker.
   ``Bob Barker has been very keen for us to arrest this guy
Coleman so legislators can see exactly what's going on,'' said Hon.

   Comedian Joan Rivers is currently in
negotation with with Tribune Entertainment Co. about hosting a
daytime television talk show, according to industry newspaper
reports.
   The former host of Fox Broadcasting Co.'s ``The Late Show'' and
guest host of NBC's ``The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson'' is
said to be working out a deal for a 26-week cycle beginning in the
fall of 1989 that would serve as a counterpart to Tribune's
``Geraldo.''
   Neither Miss Rivers nor Tribune could be reached for comment in
calls made after business hours.
   Although a contract has not been signed, it was only a matter of
``crossing the T's and dotting the I's,'' according to Friday's
editions of The Hollywood Reporter.
   The talk show would be carried by the six Tribune-owned
television stations, including KTLA in Los Angeles, WPIX in New
York and WGN in Chicago, The Daily Variety reported in its Friday
editions.
   Miss Rivers is currently appearing on Broadway in Neil Simon's
``Broadway Bound.'' She also stars as the permanent ``center
square'' on television's ``Hollywood Squares.''
   Miss Rivers vacated the guest host spot on the NBC talk show in
1986 to take the starring role in ``The Late Show,'' which debuted
Oct. 9, 1986. The show got lower ratings than expected, and she
left the program in May 1987.

<HEAD>Administration Cool To Soviet Offer On Bases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration is reacting coolly
to new Soviet proposals aimed at removing U.S. objections to a
large radar facility in Siberia.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Friday the
administration continues to insist that the Kremlin dismantle the
huge installation at Krasnoyarsk. U.S. officials say the facility
violates the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
   There is little administration interest in a Soviet offer to
allow U.S. officials to inspect the facility or a separate proposal
to convert it into an international space center, Fitzwater
indicated.
   U.S. officials took a mostly cautious stance in response to
several initiatives that Soviet General Secretary Mikhail S.
Gorbachev announced Friday in Moscow _ steps that Gorbachev said
would improve world security.
   Among Gorbachev's proposals was an offer to dismantle a large
Soviet naval base at Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam in exchange for U.S.
willingness to close military installations in the Philippines.
   President Reagan told reporters he had not had time to study the
Gorbachev proposal fully, saying, ``I look forward to doing that
because we certainly want to do anything we can to help bring about
a better relationship between our two countries.''
   But in a reference to the pitfalls of card-playing, he said,
``As I have frequently said to him (Gorbachev), `Trust everybody,
but cut the cards.'''
   Fitzwater voiced skepticism earlier, saying, ``We're somewhat
pessimistic.''
   ``It just doesn't seem to make sense on the face of it,'' the
spokesman said when asked about Gorbachev's base-closing proposal.
   ``But, on the other hand,'' he said, ``we want to give a full
analysis to the speech to that proposal, and the context of what
was said. ... I don't want to elaborate. We'll wait for a more
detailed analysis.''
   Gorbachev also proposed creation of an international center on
the peaceful use of outer space at the Siberian radar station,
according to the Soviet news agency Tass. It appeared he was
proposing the elimination or conversion of the Krasnoyarsk radar
installation, which the U.S. government claims violates the 1972
ABM treaty.
   Fitzwater said ``there was some mention'' of allowing U.S.
inspectors into Krasnoyarsk during a recent superpower review of
the ABM treaty in Geneva, and he said, ``We essentially reject that
idea.''
   ``Our demand has always been that Krasnoyarsk be dismantled as a
violation of the ABM treaty and we still believe that to be the
case,'' he said.
   ``To allow inspections or personnel to view their equipment and
so forth, or to turn it into a space station or a drive-in movie
theater, or anything else, simply does not respond to the need to
dismantle what is a violation of the treaty,'' the spokesman said.
   The United States maintains that the Krasnoyarsk facility
violates provisions of the ABM treaty prohibiting the deployment of
large radar stations capable of giving early missile attack
warnings unless such facilities are stationed on the periphery of
U.S. or Soviet territory.
   The Soviets have argued that the facility's function is to
follow objects in outer space.
   Reagan got some support from Capitol Hill as the Senate voted
81-0 to support the administration's contention that the giant
Soviet radar system violates the treaty.
   ``These violations are a threat to the security of the United
States,'' said Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., author of the
resolution.
   The non-binding resolution said the radar station question
should be settled before there are any new U.S.-Soviet agreements
on limiting strategic, or long-range, atomic weapons. The two sides
are now negotiating toward a 50 percent reduction in such arms.
   The resolution also urged Reagan to develop ``appropriate,
proportionate response options'' to the Soviet radar station.
   Fitzwater told reporters at the daily White House news briefing
that the administration was not yet prepared to declare Krasnoyarsk
a ``material breach'' of the treaty _ a step that effectively would
serve notice of American withdrawal from the ABM pact.
   ``I frankly think it's unlikely that there would be any change
in our present position'' against a breakout from the treaty, he
said.

<HEAD>NASA Sets Shuttle Launch Date As Threat Of Hurricane Eases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The much-delayed launch of the shuttle
Discovery for the first manned space mission since the 1986
Challenger disaster has been set by NASA for Sept. 29.
   A three hour launch ``window'' from the Kennedy Space Center in
Florida opens at 9:59 a.m. EDT.
   ``I'm delighted to have reached this point,'' said Richard
Truly, National Aeronautics and Space Administration flight chief,
in making the announcement Friday. ``My hat is off to all members
of the shuttle team whose tireless efforts have brought us here to
the brink of America's return to manned space.''
   The date was set after Truly decided that Hurricane Gilbert
would not disrupt operations at the Johnson Space Center in
Houston, home of Mission Control for shuttle flights.
   ``No threat to JSC facilities is projected if Gilbert continues
on its current path,'' the announcement said.
   The first flight in 32 months will be a four-day, one hour
mission to deploy a huge NASA communications satellite. Discovery
is to land at Edwards Air Force base in the Mojave Desert on Oct.
3, if the launch goes as scheduled.
   Navy Capt. Frederick Hauck will command the five-man flight, all
of whom have been on previous missions. The crewmen are Air Force
Col. Richard O. Covey, the pilot, and mission specialists George D.
Nelson, John M. Lounge and Marine Lt. Col. David C. Hilmers.
   The shuttle was cleared for flight Wednesday after a two-day
review of the shuttle's systems and the readiness of launch and
flight control teams at the launch site.
   The $100 million Tracking and Data Relay Satellite that the
astronauts will carry into orbit is a twin of one lost in the
Challenger explosion Jan. 28, 1986. It is needed to complete a
communications system that eventually will replace all
ground-to-air links with the space shuttle and a number of
satellites.
   They will also conduct 11 science and technology experiments and
check out hundreds of design changes made to the shuttle.
   NASA had hoped to return to manned space flight sooner with the
26th shuttle mission, designated as STS-26. But five announced
launch dates had to be scrubbed because of technical problems
involved in the $1.2 billion redesign. There were 56 major changes
and more than 400 lesser ones; the orbiter alone received 210 fixes.
   The most extensive changes were made to solid fuel rockets that
provide more than 70 percent of the power to propel the shuttle
into orbit.
   The Challenger explosion, which claimed the lives of seven
astronauts including schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe, was caused by
a leak in one booster that allowed a plume of flame to reach the
fuel tank.
   NASA grounded the shuttles following the explosion.
   One major change implemented is an escape system designed for
use if the shuttle has to ditch in the ocean. It has been installed
in Discovery and will be put into the two other shuttles remaining
in the fleet. A replacement for Challenger is being built and
should be ready for flight in 1990.

   A sudden rash of illness affecting
hundreds of University of North Dakota students who ate at a school
cafeteria has been blamed on food poisoning, university officials
said.
   More than 220 students had been treated with antibiotics at the
school's student health services as of Friday, university spokesman
Peter Johnson said. Two diabetic students were hospitalized as a
precaution, Johnson said.
   All of the students apparently had eaten recently at the
Wilkerson Hall cafeteria, school officials said. The cafeteria
serves a university complex of five residence halls, which house
about 1,500 students.
   Dr. John Swenson, director of student health services, said food
poisoning was the most likely cause of the illnesses, which
included stomach cramps, diarrhea and vomiting.

   A joint U.S.-Vietnamese team soon will begin
an on-site investigation into the fate of missing American
servicemen, focussing on seven cases in which there is evidence the
victims were alive when they disappeared.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Friday the seven
are part of the 70 ``most compelling cases'' which U.S. officials
raised with Vietnamese authorities last year.
   Other officials said that although the 70 were presumed to be
alive when they became separated from their units, all have long
since been presumed dead because there is no evidence to prove
otherwise.
   This is the first time the United States and Vietnam have agreed
on a joint investigation involving more than one site. Officials
from the two countries participated in the excavation of a crash
site in search of missing servicemen in November 1985.
   Lt. Col. Joe Harvey, commander of the U.S. Joint Casualty
Resolution Center, said in a telephone interview Friday from
Honolulu, ``We're going to do joint investigations of incidents,
not just crash sites, but places where people were last thought to
be but we don't know exactly what happened to them.
   ``I think it's a very significant development,'' he said. ``We
think this will be the first of many such joint activities.'' The
inspections will be concentrated in an area north of Hanoi.
   On Friday, House Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois
urged the families of missing servicemen to ignore the rumors that
will be inevitable during the pending search.
   ``We have to continue to press for an accounting of each and
every one, even though the prospects of finding anyone alive
diminish with the passing of time,'' Michel told a crowd of several
hundred at a National POW-MIA Recognition Day ceremony on the steps
of the Capitol.
   All told, more than 1,700 Americans remain unaccounted for in
Vietnam since U.S. military involvement in the country ended 15
years ago. There is no firm evidence that any are alive although
officials routinely check out reports of live sightings.
   The two countries reached agreement on an on-site inspection
procedure during a meeting in Hanoi that ended Wednesday, Redman
said. The investigation will involve interviews with villagers and
other activities.
   A 90-day period, beginning Sept. 1, was set aside for carrying
out the investigations, Redman said, with each one limited to 10
days.
   After suspending cooperation with the United States on the MIA
issue in August, Vietnam recently agreed to resume discussions on
the issue.
   The suspension was precipitated by Hanoi's unhappiness with the
administration's policy of keeping Vietnam isolated diplomatically
and economically until that country withdraws its troops from
Cambodia.
   Vietnam is one of the few countries with which the United States
does not have diplomatic relations.
   While restoring cooperation on the MIA question, Vietnam has not
lifted a ban on discussions about a program to permit thousands of
former political prisoners to emigrate to the United States.

<HEAD>US Considers Changing Convoy Procedures In Persian Gulf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration has approved in
principle its first change in Persian Gulf convoy procedures as a
result of the Iran-Iraq cease-fire, defense officials say.
   Assuming the changes are finalized, U.S.-flag tankers in the
waterway will be kept within a ``defensive zone'' by American
warships and always under surveillance, but won't be accompanied
every step of the way as is now the case, the sources said.
   ``The best way to describe it is in basketball terms, by saying
you're going from a man-to-man defense to a zone defense,'' said
one official.
   The change will allow only a slight reduction in the number of
warships deployed to the Persian Gulf _ probably one fewer ship _
but will increase the flexibility of the task force commander and
allow the Navy's ships to operate at a lesser alert level, the
officials added.
   The sources, who agreed to discuss the matter only if not
identified, said the change in procedure had been tentatively
approved by the Pentagon and White House, but would not be ordered
until allies with warships in the region and certain Mideast
countries were consulted.
   The Defense Department declined to discuss details of the plan
on Friday but acknowledged in a statement:
   ``The administration is considering additional steps which ...
(could be described as) modest modifications of our present method
of providing protection to U.S.-flagged shipping in the gulf.
   ``The modifications currently under consideration do not involve
any significant reduction in force levels. We are continuing to
consult with our friends and allies.''
   The United States has 26 Navy ships assigned to its Joint Task
Force Middle East, including 17 inside the Persian Gulf itself. As
of Friday, the Navy had conducted 85 convoy operations since the
summer of 1987, when the escorts began.
   With the exception of the departure of one cruiser, the USS
Vincennes, the naval force has not changed in size despite last
month's end to hostilities between Iran and Iraq.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci has said repeatedly the
United States will not reduce its military presence in the region
until it is absolutely convinced the cease-fire will hold and that
American merchant ships aren't threatened.
   According to the sources, Carlucci has approved the idea of
``providing flexibility'' to the Navy on convoys.
   ``You keep your warships nearby, always close enough to act, but
drop the continuous, side-by-side presence,'' explained one source.
   ``The Navy vessels deploy in what amounts to a picket line up
and down the gulf, ready to pick up a merchant as it moves within a
particular range,'' said another.
   The sources said the plan called for the Navy to directly escort
merchants through the narrow Strait of Hormuz, the sole entrance to
the Persian Gulf, but to use the picket-line approach for the
remainder of the trip.
   ``This is the first important response to the cease-fire,'' said
one source. ``If this works out OK, then we can consider additional
steps.''
   The United States mounted its escort operations in 1987 after
President Reagan approved a request by Kuwait to reflag 11 of its
tankers under the American flag. Kuwait, a key ally of Iraq in the
8-year-old war, had seen its ships become a special target of
Iranian forces and wanted to obtain U.S. military protection.
   For more than 40 years before the escorts, the Navy's normal
Persian Gulf presence consisted of four to six ships.

<HEAD>Airlines Ordered To Check Takeoff Warning Alarms On All Boeing 727
Jets</HEAD>

   Airlines have been ordered by the Federal
Aviation Administration to check takeoff warning alarms on all
Boeing 727 jetliners because of questions raised in the
investigation of a Delta Air Lines crash last month.
   FAA officials said Friday the directive to the airlines for a
one-time check of the estimated 1,200 727 jets in domestic
operation was ``purely precautionary.''
   There is no evidence that the alarm, which warns of a false flap
setting, malfunctioned in the Delta plane that crashed Aug. 31 at
the Dallas-Fort Worth airport, killing 14 of the 108 people aboard,
the officials said.
   Anthony Broderick, the FAA's associate administrator for
regulation and certification, said checking the alarms on all
Boeing 727s was ``not anything other than our own effort to gather
data.''
   ``It shouldn't be read that we have any indication that the
flaps were involved in the (Delta) accident,'' he said.
   In Seattle, Boeing Co. spokeswoman Liz Reese said the company
was unaware of the FAA order. She added that the order is not an
unusual action.
   Broderick said the action was taken because there have been ``a
lot of questions asked'' in connection with the crash and the
positioning of the flaps during the takeoff.
   Investigators have uncovered conflicting evidence as to whether
the flaps were positioned properly prior to the Delta crash. The
federal investigation has not yet determined the cause of the
accident.
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators have said
that among the areas being examined is whether the flight crew
extended the flap setting as required. If the flaps were not
extended for takeoff as required, an alarm should have sounded in
the Delta's cockpit, but no such alarm could be heard on the
cockpit voice recorder tape.
   An aircraft's wing flaps help the plane gain lift and should
have been extended 15 degrees when the Delta jet took off.
   The lever that controls the flaps in the Delta jet was found in
a ``retracted'' position and the flaps on the wing also were found
retracted. However, the co-pilot was heard on the cockpit voice
recorder tape to acknowledge that the flaps had been set at the 15
degree position.
   One theory being examined is that the flap setting might have
been called out, but not set properly. Another theory has been that
a crew member might have extended the flaps properly prior to
takeoff, but at the last second retracted them in a desperate
attempt to reduce drag and keep the plane aloft.
   The NTSB announced Thursday that an inspection of the three
engines of the Boeing 727 found no mechanical failure that could be
blamed for the accident.

<HEAD>Lehman Says His Changes Didn't Weaken Procurement System</HEAD>

   Former Navy Secretary John Lehman says the
changes during his controversial tenure didn't lead to the current
Pentagon investigation of bribery in Navy contracts.
   ``I am very proud of the achievements made in rebuilding the
Navy during my tenure. I do not believe the changes that led to
that success made the system, by its nature, more susceptible to
waste, fraud and abuse,'' he said Friday.
   Lehman's appearance before the House Armed Services Committee
was his first major public comment since the ongoing investigation
became public three months ago.
   The investigation concerns allegations of bribes from
consultants, many of them former Pentagon employees, to current
Defense Department employees to obtain inside information about
contracts. Those details could be crucial to winning multimillion
dollar contracts. No charges have yet been filed.
   A key figure of the investigation is Melvyn Paisley, the former
assistant navy secretary for research and engineering and a close
associate of Lehman during their Navy tenure.
   Paisley resigned and became a high-priced consultant shortly
after Lehman quit to take a Wall Street job in April 1987.
   Lehman was a controversial figure during his six-year tenure,
often clashing with lawmakers and other critics of Reagan's naval
build-up. That buildup was the key component of Reagan's program of
large increases in the Pentagon budget.
   Lehman didn't talk about specifics of the investigation and
committee members didn't seek those details because they didn't
want to harm the probe. But he noted the Navy has more consultants
than the other services, chiefly because the service has fewer
officers. Some Navy tasks are performed by consultants that in the
Army and Air Force would be done by officers, he said.
   ``Consultants are essential, but we do have too many,'' he
added. ``The Navy could substantially reduce its reliance on
consultants.''
   ``I was never comfortable with the dependence on consultants,''
Lehman said, adding that his efforts to reduce that dependence were
thwarted by unidentified bureaucrats.
   Lehman did endorse a pair of reforms proposed after the
investigation became public. One would require consultants to
register and the other would direct them to disclose all their
contracts to prevent conflicts of interest.
   Lehman strongly defended his running of the Navy, disputing
critics who have said the changes he ordered may have fostered a
climate which led to the investigation. Those changes include more
centralized management and elimination of some layers of
bureaucracy.
   ``With regard to strong centralized policy-making and
decentralized execution, I see no way that either principle
increases the opportunity for waste, fraud and abuse,'' he said.
   Overall, said Lehman, the Pentagon should be reorganized to give
much more authority for daily decisions to lower-level personnel,
rather than top officials. He opposed the creation of a single
purchasing ``czar,'' a change proposed by some lawmakers.
   He proposed that the secretary of defense simply make policy,
and turn all other major decisions over to the three services.
   The staff also should be reduced by half, he said.

<HEAD>House Panel Suggests New Limits On Free Mailings For Congress</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Election-year mass mailings by lawmakers have
risen dramatically and prompted leaders of a House committee to
call for new restrictions on how much mail can be sent at taxpayer
expense.
   Four members of the House Administration Committee, including
its Democratic chairman and senior Republican member, said in a
letter Friday that increased numbers of taxpayer-paid mailings this
year have caused a backlog in their processing and delivery. That
could cause some of the mail to arrive at voters' homes during the
height of the campaign season in late October, they said.
   Critics contend that some mailings, particularly newsletters,
are little more than government-paid campaign literature intended
to promote the re-election of officeholders.
   Under House rules, members cannot send a mass mailing less than
60 days before the date of a primary or general election in which
their name appears on the ballot. Mailings must be delivered to the
House folding room by that deadline for processing.
   The lawmakers said that after the cutoff period this month,
there were 58 million pieces of mail awaiting processing by the
Publications Distribution Service.
   There were 35.4 million pieces of mail ready for processing at
the same point in 1986, 36.7 million in 1984 and 33.3 million in
1982.
   A temporary second shift of workers was added to the House
folding room earlier this year at a cost of nearly $500,000, and
their employment has been extended through mid-October to help
handle the larger volume of mail, the lawmakers said.
   ``It is essential that additional limitations be considered to
prevent this situation from repeating itself to the detriment of
the House and its members,'' the lawmakers said in their letter.
   Generally, members are limited to six mass mailings for their
districts during a year, but that does not include town meeting
notices.

<HEAD>Court Decision Expected Soon On House Auctioning</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge is expected to decide soon
whether the Reagan administration has considered the needs of the
homeless before auctioning off about 47,000 foreclosed homes that
are owned by the government.
   U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch declined Friday to decide
several challenges by the homeless to the federal government's
policies, but said he would make his decision as soon as possible
after taking the arguments under advisement.
   William Bradford, an attorney for homeless advocates, reminded
Gasch that two temporary restraining orders barring the Department
of Housing and Urban Development from selling houses in the greater
Washington area and in Michigan expired Friday.
   Gasch replied, ``I would hope they would maintain the status
quo.''
   Government attorneys told Gasch they would have to consult with
their clients, but HUD general counsel J. Michael Dorsey said later
through a spokesman that the housing agency would follow the terms
of the restraining order through the end of business next Wednesday.
   The coalition of advocates for the homeless argued the HUD has
violated the law by selling its stock of foreclosed single-family
homes to the highest bidder without determining whether they could
be beneficial to the homeless and low-income people.
   Bradford told Gasch that HUD receives 70,000 houses each year _
about 7,000 a month _ but the agency ``cannot proceed as if it is
simply in the real estate business. They must consider the
homeless.''
   In a related case, the National Coalition for the Homeless also
argued that the Reagan administration has defied a congressional
mandate to release underused federal property as housing for the
nation's homeless.
   Ms. Maria Foscarinis, a coalition attorney, said ``there are
thousands of properties underutilized which could be used for the
homeless.'' She said that of the 12 facilities that have been
officially identified as underutilized, only two have been made
available to the homeless.
   ``It's unconscionable - as well as illegal - that federal
buildings stand vacant while homeless men, women and children sleep
on the streets,'' she said.
   The suits want the court to order the government agencies to
survey their property, determine which is underutilized or no
longer needed and make those properties available for the homeless.
   Government attorney W. Robert Irwin argued that the 1987
homeless act does not apply to single family dwellings ``They want
to shut down a program that has been going on for 50 years,'' he
said. ``They want to tie up the program.''
   Arthur Goldberg, another government lawyer, said all the
agencies have complied with the requirements of the provisions of
the homeless act.

<HEAD>Republicans Pushing `Training' Wage As Alternative To Kennedy Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republicans are planning to whittle away at
Democratic-proposed increases in the $3.35 minimum wage for the
first time in eight years through a subminimum ``training'' wage _
but not until next week.
   With many senators taking Friday off to campaign for re-election
in their home states, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, was unwilling to
risk a vote on a Democratic measure aimed at killing his proposal
for a 80 percent subminimum wage.
   Under the Hatch proposal, employers could pay the ``training''
wage during the first 90 days a worker is on their payroll.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., the chief author of the mininum
wage bill, was ready to vote Friday on his proposal to double the
number of student exemptions that employers can now use to pay
part-time workers 15 percent below the wage floor _ or $2.85 an
hour presently.
   Hatch called Kennedy's proposal a ``mock training wage,'' saying
it would would not give employers any incentive to ``open the door
to those who have nothing, who are undereducated and unskilled.''
   He said his subminimum training wage advocated by the Reagan
administration, Vice President George Bush and Bush's running mate,
Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind., could ``create hundreds of thousands of
new jobs.''
   With presidential and congressional elections just eight weeks
away, President Reagan, Bush and other Republicans have softened
their opposition to any increase, but have not said how large it
should be.
   In June, Quayle offered before the Senate Labor Committee a
proposed raise to $4 an hour over two years but coupled it with a
subminimum training wage. The measure was never voted on.
   Bush, campaigning in Ohio, said Friday that a lower training
wage, the administration's euphemism for a subminimum rate that it
has advocated since 1981, must accompany any increase for him to
support it.
   Kennedy called the Republican proposals a Trojan Horse, saying
Quayle's proposal for a $4 minimum wage amounts to a 10 percent cut
in buying power after taking inflation into account from when
Reagan and Bush took office.
   ``And from that miserly floor, he proposes a further cut for all
new hires,'' Kennedy said. ``Can this be what George Bush means
when he talks about a kinder, gentler America?''
   Kennedy's bill would raise the minimum wage 40 cents an hour in
each of the next three years _ to $3.75 in 1989; $4.50 in 1990 and
$4.55 in 1991 _ directly benefitting about 15 million workers now
paid less than $4.50 an hour.
   Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said he hoped to get a
vote on Kennedy's and Hatch's different subminimum proposals next
Tuesday and a vote on final passage by the end of next week.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said the House will take up
and ``likely pass'' it as soon as the Senate acts.

<HEAD>Judge Refuses to Drop Weapons Charges Against Columnist</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Syndicated columnist Carl T. Rowan received a
setback when a judge refused to dismiss weapons charges against
him, ruling that Rowan was not authorized to own a handgun he used
to wound a teenager trespassing in his backyard.
   District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Arthur L. Burnett Sr.
on Friday also directed that Rowan's case be heard before a jury in
a trial scheduled for Sept. 22.
   The columnist, an outspoken opponent of ownership and use of
handguns, faces one count each of possession of an unregistered
weapon and ammunition for the gun. If convicted of both misdemeanor
charges, he would face a maximum penalty of two years in jail and a
$2,000 fine.
   Rowan, 63, had argued in a pre-trial hearing that the charges
should be dismissed because the weapon used in the June 14 shooting
had been given to him by his son, Carl Jr., a former FBI agent, who
had been told it was not necessary to register the weapon because
he was a law enforcement officer.
   Although Rowan concentrated on whether his son was misled by
city officials in his efforts to register the weapon, Burnett gave
greater weight to the question of whether the elder Rowan was
authorized to possess the gun.
   The city's far-reaching 1976 handgun ordinance makes clear that
``a valid holder of a registration certificate for a firearm could
not lend or give it to another person ... whether that person be a
relative or a friend, and whether the purpose was for protection or
some other worthy objective,'' Burnett concluded.
   Burnett also rejected Rowan's claim of exemption from the gun
control law on the grounds that he uses his home as a business, not
just a residence.
   Benjamin N. Smith, 19, of suburban Chevy Chase, Md., was wounded
in the wrist when Rowan caught him and three others taking a swim
in his backyard pool.
   Rowan says he shot Smith when the teen-ager lunged at him, but
Smith said he was shot while trying to flee.

<HEAD>Sessions Acknowledges Contacts With Salvadoran National Guard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   FBI Director William Sessions has acknowledged
contact between between a bureau intelligence source and the
Salvadoran National Guard.
   But in comments to a House subcommittee Friday, Sessions said it
will be impossible to determine whether the source gave the Guard
sensitive information from FBI files.
   Critics of the Salvadoran government claim links between the
National Guard and right-wing death squad killings in the Central
American country. Salvadoran political leaders reject the
allegations.
   Sessions told the subcommittee hearing on the FBI's
investigation of the Committee in Solidarity with the People of El
Salvador that there were ``communications'' between former bureau
intelligence source Frank Varelli and the Guard.
   ``I do not know specifically what he gave to the El Salvador
National Guard,'' Sessions said. ``We have no way of establishing
that.'' He said it was possible Varelli passed along sensitive
information.
   It was disclosed last year that Varelli, who is suing the FBI
for back pay, had given congressional investigators a list of 13
Salvadorans facing deportation from the United States. He told
Congress in February 1987 that he had gotten the list from FBI
Agent Daniel Flanagan of Dallas, and he passed it along to the
Salvadoran National Guard. Flanagan subsequently resigned from the
FBI.
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., suggested Varelli may have had
access to other such lists as well.
   ``It is quite possible,'' Sessions responded in testimony before
the House subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights, which
Edwards chairs. Sessions noted that the bureau took action to
ensure that the 13 Salvadorans ``were in fact informed'' their
names had turned up on the list.
   The FBI early in 1987 rejected a suggestion by Edwards, based on
information from Varelli, that the bureau was trading information
with the National Guard in El Salvador. Oliver Revell, executive
assistant director of the FBI, said at the time that such a
suggestion ``is not true.''
   Based on information supplied by Varelli, the FBI launched a
terrorism probe of CISPES in March 1983.
   Sessions disciplined half a dozen bureau personnel Wednesday for
negligence in the investigation. He said the bureau failed
initially to check out Varelli's unreliable background and that the
bureau broadened the probe unnecessarily in October 1983 to cover
rank-and-file CISPES members who had nothing to do with
international terrorism. The FBI closed the probe in June 1985
after failing to establish any substantial link between CISPES and
international terrorism.
   Sessions said the FBI in the CISPES probe committed no illegal
acts and no violations of constitutional rights.

   Vice President George Bush is steeping
himself in the symbols and rhetoric of patriotism while stepping up
accusations that Michael Dukakis is an out-of-touch liberal who
acts like a chameleon on the campaign trail.
   In campaign appearances on Friday, the Republican presidential
candidate ridiculed Dukakis' campaign trip this week to plants and
other facilities run by defense contractors. In one appearance,
Dukakis rode in an M-1 tank.
   ``I can't say he's not trying, the opponent from Masachusetts,''
Bush told a rally in Findlay, Ohio, honoring the U.S. flag. ``He
drove a tank this week but after he drove it, the tank kept veering
left.''
   In a news conference earlier Friday, Bush accused the Democratic
Massachusetts governor of being a ``made over'' candidate who is
trying to hide a liberal record from American voters.
   After opposing the MX missile, the Midgetman, and the B-1
Bomber, ``Now suddenly he rides around in a tank, jumps out of the
tank, takes off the helmet and comes on with different positions,''
Bush charged.
   Dukakis has since modified his opposition on the B-1.
   ``The tank did not fit,'' he said. ``It's time to take another
message to Michael... You cannot fool the Soviet leadership by
knocking America's defense for 10 years and then riding around in a
tank for 10 minutes ... You can't fool the American people.''
   Bush made the comments in Columbus, Ohio, after a tour of the
Buckeye Steel plant where his grandfather, Samuel Prescott Bush,
was president in the early part of the centry.
   Later, the visual setting was all red-white-and-blue as Bush
spoke against a colorful backdrop of flags on his visit to Findlay
in northwest Ohio. His appearance in the city, which was formally
designated Flag City, USA, in 1974, was to help kick off the town's
three-day festival honoring the flag.
   He said the Findlay townspeople got Congress to designate their
city Flag City in 1974 because ``the time had come to stand up for
the American flag and the values it represented and that is good
old-fashioned patriotism.''
   A crowd of a few thousand crowded the town intersection where
Bush spoke from the steps of the stately old Elks Club building.
   Of the flag he said, ``It is the symbol of these United States
of America and to the liberty for which it stands one nation under
god, with freedom and justice for all.''
   Bush has made a campaign target of Dukakis' gubernatorial veto
of a Massachusetts measure to require teachers to lead their
students in the pledge of allegiance to the flag.
   Bush also said Dukakis is trying to hide his liberalism.
   ``He refuses to repeat the positions that he took in wrapping up
that Democratic primary,'' Bush said. ``He ran way out on the left
and now he's trying to move over, and I'd say make the American
people forget the positions that he ran on and the positions that
he's lived on since he's been the liberal governor of the state of
Massachusetts.''
   Later Bush continued to emphasize his own pro-defense themes
when he helped unveil a monument to the Airmen who died in Vietnam
at the Air Force Museum at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in
Dayton.
   Bush has planned a quiet weekend, with only one public event,
attending a naturalization ceremony today for a group of immigrants.

   Republican vice presidential candidate Dan
Quayle has a new campaign battle cry: ``endive!''
   Quayle got a lot of mileage in farm states Friday out of the
leafy vegetable and some pithy one-liners as he accused Democrat
Michael Dukakis of being ``out of touch'' with the nation's
heartland.
   ``We need people who will listen to agriculture, not talk down
to it,'' Quayle said in speeches in Omaha, Neb., and in Des Moines.
``I reviewed the farm program of the governor of Massachusetts. His
idea of farm production is growing flowers in Harvard Yard.''
   In his five-day campaign swing through the Midwest and Plains
states, Quayle increasingly turned to ridicule and hyperbole to
make his points.
   Quayle is spending the weekend at home in McLean, Va. He attends
a picnic today at the Virginia home of Sen. John Warner, the
ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, on which
Quayle also serves.
   On Friday, Quayle ridiculed Dukakis, the Democratic presidential
nominee, for suggestions that livestock and grain farmers consider
growing Belgian endive.
   ``During the primary season last winter, our opponent responded
that one of the answers to helping farmers was for them to grow
different crops,'' Quayle said. ``He suggested blueberries and
Belgian endive to pull farmers out of their economic doldrums.''
   Republicans have been making hay of Dukakis' endive remark,
which he made in Iowa, since the Republican National Convention.
   Quayle said the ``entire national market'' for Belgian endive is
worth less than $10 million per year.
   ``So if you start growing these little things, don't count on
paying off the farm debt,'' Quayle said.
   He got laughs from the crowds when he held up a head of endive
to show them ``just how the man from Massachusetts thinks he can
rebuild the farm economy.''
   In Des Moines, Quayle joined in after the audience started
chanting: ``endive! endive!''
   Dukakis, he said, doesn't understand the ``heartland of
America'' and is ``out of touch with the people across America.''
   He said Dukakis also had switched ``back and forth'' so much on
defense issues in recent days that ``I decided to sum it up this
way: His farm policy is the Belgian endive and his defense policy
is the Belgian waffle.''
   Quayle said a George Bush administration would open more markets
abroad for U.S. agricultural products, support development of
alternative fuels such as ethanol, which is made from grain, and
focus more on rural economic development.
   ``We'll get that capital gains tax down to 15 percent and that
will help small businesses which means more jobs here in the
heartland,'' Quayle said. ``I can also assure you that with us, you
get folks who are experienced in lowering interest rates, lowering
inflation, creating jobs, increasing productivity and keeping the
peace,''

   Democrat Michael Dukakis laid part of the blame
for Southern California's growing drug problem on George Bush as he
pledged more agents and prosecutors in a stepped up fight against
drug kingpins.
   ``George Bush was supposed to be in charge of that war, and we
all know what happened,'' the Democratic presidential nominee told
students at Roosevelt High School in the Latino section of East Los
Angeles on Friday.
   ``You know, if you don't show up at school, you fail, and if you
don't show up at your job as chief officer of the war on drugs, you
fail, the American people lose, and the drug lords take over,'' he
said.
   Dukakis, trying to reverse a slide in California polls, was
campaigning for a second day in the state today.
   He was meeting with campaign workers in Anaheim in Orange
County, a conservative Republican area where the campaign hopes to
cut into Bush's expected support. From there, Dukakis was flying
back to Washington to meet with members of the Congressional Black
Caucus at a dinner Jesse Jackson was expected to attend.
   The Massachusetts governor planned to resume campaigning Monday
with stops in Texas, possibly to visit hurricane-damaged areas,
while devoting much of the rest of his week to preparations for
meeting his Republican rival in their first debate.
   Dukakis made drugs the focus of his California foray, and he
suggested the Reagan administration had slighted California in
favor of Florida in allocating anti-drug resources.
   ``Today you have less than half the number of DEA (Drug
Enforcement Admininstration) agents they have in Miami,'' Dukakis
told rookies at the Los Angeles Police Academy. ``That's going to
change.''
   California, the largest state with 47 electoral votes, is
considered a crucial battleground along with Texas for the Dukakis
campaign _ while Florida remains virtually out of reach and has
been the object of little personal campaigning by the candidate.
   However, his running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, visited
Florida on Friday and today.
   Dukakis pledged to double the 2,800 DEA agents nationally over
five years, beginning with 600 next year, and to add 800 new
federal prosecutors in an effort to speed up handling of drug cases.
   Dukakis promised to send the first 100 drug agents to Southern
California, where he said cocaine seizures have risen 3,500 percent
during the Reagan years and there have been ``massive increases''
in drug-related deaths.
   Campaign aides said the prosecutors would cost $40 million and
the new drug agents would cost $50 million the first year. Dukakis
asserted that the agents would pay for themselves, however, through
seizure and forefeiture of assets.
   ``It's really a no-cost step,'' he told police officers in Chula
Vista, just south of San Diego.
   Outside the Chula Vista police station, Dukakis was greeted by
demonstrators needling him for his prison furlough policy, which
was changed in the face of public opposition.
   Several demonstrators wore mock prisoner's stripes. They
chanted, ``Let me out, I'll kill again.'' One carried a sign saying
``Hey Mike, thanks for the weekend.''

   Democratic vice presidential candidate
Lloyd Bentsen stood in a downtown ballroom, on courthouse steps and
at a shuffleboard court _ in three different cities _ to deliver
the same message.
   ``I'm looking for old friends who wandered away in recent
years,'' he said. ``I'm talking to the Reagan Democrats. I'm urging
them to come home, and they're responding.''
   Bentsen, the Texas senator who Michael Dukakis picked as running
mate to help woo the South, spoke Friday morning in a Memphis hotel
and in the afternoon at the Pitt County, N.C., courthouse in
Greenville.
   There, he spiced his stump speech with a rebuke of Vice
President George Bush's attempts to denigrate Dukakis' performance
as Massachusetts governor.
   ``Under Mike Dukakis, Massachusetts unemployment is the lowest
rate of any major industrial state in this union,'' he said.
``Wages are growing twice as fast as the national average, personal
income growing faster than any other state, and he submitted ten
balanced budgets in a row.
   ``When George Bush speaks out against Mike Dukakis. We should
all remember that when it came to speaking out against arms to
Iran, when it came to speaking out against cozy deals with Gen.
(Manuel Antonio) Noriega of Panama, when it came to speaking out
against economic policies that have almost tripled the national
debt, Geoge Bush didn't speak, he just voted present.
   ``I'll tell you, when it comes to strong leadership, George Bush
has got himself a bad case of laryngitis.''
   By evening, Bentsen was in Palm Beach, Fla., in a trailer park's
shuffleboard area next to a Coast Guard Cutter, where he tailored
his speech with an attack on the Reagan administration and Bush for
failure in the fight against drug imports.
   ``They asked him to lead'' the fight against drugs, he said.
``And he blew it badly.'' Bentsen was joined by Sen. Lawton Chiles,
D-Fla., an old friend from Washington who also accompanied him to
Panama City.
   The Palm Beach stop also included a ritzy, closed-door
fund-raiser at the home of a prominent attorney. About $50,000 was
raised for Bentsen's Senate re-election campaign.
   Under an unusual Texas law, Bentsen is running both for the vice
presidency and a fourth term in the U.S. Senate.
   The vice presidential campaign, which had been bogged down by
scheduling difficulties the day before, appeared to be picking up
the pace. ``We've had a helluva good day,'' Bentsen told reporters
on his campaign plane.
   Bentsen was returning to Washington this afternoon and heading
back on Monday to his home state of Texas to resume campaigning.
   Bentsen expressed relief that Hurricane Gilbert appeared to be
going ashore in a sparsely-populated area of Mexico. In addition to
his general concerns about Texas, Bentson's father has a ranch in
the Rio Grande valley near Brownsville, which apparently was being
spared major damage.

<NOTE>Eds: Top prospects uncertain</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis pledged in California to fight the nation's drug
problem with more spending and more hiring, while George Bush
questioned his rival's sincerity on defense issues as both
candidates planned for the first presidential debate of the
campaign.
   In a speech Friday at the Los Angeles Police Academy, the
Democratic presidential nominee told recruits he would double the
number of Drug Enforcement Administration agents over the next five
years, paying for the increase with cash and other assets seized in
drug busts. Dukakis also pledged to hire 800 more federal
prosecutors.
   ``We're going to send a message to drug kingpins,'' he said.
``As far as Mike Dukakis is concerned, there's nowhere you can run,
there's nowhere you can sail, there's nowhere you can hide. There
will be no safe haven for dope peddlers and drug profits anywhere
on this Earth.''
   But Dukakis, in a later appearance, mistakenly said that DEA
agents at one point had to hold a bake sale to raise stakeout
money. Aides explained that the book that was the source of that
anecdote said the bake sale was held to raise money for drug
education.
   Bush, the Republican nominee, spent much of the day in Ohio,
where he derided what he called Dukakis' shifting positions on
defense.
   ``You cannot fool the Soviet leadership by knocking America's
defense for 10 years and then riding around in a tank for 10
minutes,'' Bush said Friday in Columbus, Ohio, making light of
Dukakis' well-filmed visit to a tank design facility. ``You can't
fool the American people.''
   Bush's running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, combined that
criticism with a jab at Dukakis' farm policy by referring to his
statement that cash grain and livestock farmers should consider
alternative crops such as Belgian endive and blueberries.
   Contending that Dukakis is out of touch with Middle America,
Quayle told an audience in Omaha, Neb.: ``I decided to sum it up
this way: His farm policy is the Belgian endive and his defense
policy is the Belgian waffle.''
   Quayle was finishing a five-day swing of Midwest and Plains
states.
   Quayle's Democratic counterpart, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, took
special aim during an appearance in Greenville, N.C., at Bush's
claim Thursday that Dukakis mismanaged Massachusetts' fiscal
affairs.
   ``When George Bush speaks out against Mike Dukakis,'' he said,
``we should all remember that when it came to speaking out against
arms to Iran, when it came to speaking out against cozy deals with
Gen. Noriega of Panama, when it came to speaking out against
economic policies that have almost tripled the national debt,
George Bush didn't speak, he just voted present.''
   Both Bush and Dukakis ran into some turbulence while campaigning.
   Outside the Chula Vista, Calif., police station, Dukakis was
greeted by demonstrators needling him for his prison furlough
policy, which was changed in the face of public opposition.
   Several demonstrators wore mock prisoner's stripes. They
chanted, ``Let me out, I'll kill again.'' One carried a sign saying
``Hey Mike, thanks for the weekend.''
   In Findlay, Ohio, where the annual flag celebration was held
Friday, some residents complained Bush had turned it into a
political photo opportunity.
   ``What was intended to be a non-partisan promotion of fun and
patriotism has turned into a partisan use of the flag for private
gain by a candidate,'' said local businessman Neil Scott.
   The vice president returned to Washington, where Dukakis also
was headed to meet with members of the Congressional Black Caucus
at a dinner that Jesse Jackson was also expected to attend.
   Both men have set aside large parts of next week to prepare for
their first debate of the fall presidential campaign, a 90-minute
nationally televised session a week from Sunday in Winston-Salem,
N.C.
   In Washington, members of the Dukakis campaign, the Democratic
National Committee and Jesse Jackson's National Rainbow Coalition
stressed unity during a news conference in which they announced a
stepped-up registration and get-out-the-vote effort aimed at
minority voters.
   Joseph Warren, the general election coordinator for the Dukakis
campaign, said the drive targets 42 cities in 14 states. The
Democratic Party will ``take the lead'' in the campaign, which will
try to register 2 million new voters and win a minimum 70 percent
black voter participation in the Nov. 8 election.

<HEAD>Conflicting Testimony On Whether Alcoholism Hurt Deaver's Memory</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The judge who will sentence Michael K. Deaver
for perjury is pondering sharply conflicting testimony about
whether alcoholism impaired the former presidential aide's memory
when he gave sworn testimony.
   Dr. William Flynn, Deaver's doctor during two hospital visits
for alcoholism in 1985 and 1986, said the former White House aide
likely suffered memory impairment from tranquilizers he took for
alcohol withdrawal.
   But Ralph Tarter, an alcoholism expert testifying for the
prosecution, said ``motivational reasons rather than neurological
reasons'' best explained Deaver's failures of recollection under
oath.
   Attorneys for Deaver offered two days of medical testimony to
show that alcoholism should be considered a mitigating factor when
the former presidential aide is sentenced for lying when his
lobbying was investigated for possible ethics-law violations.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson is scheduled to
sentence Deaver on Sept. 23. The former deputy White House chief of
staff faces a possible five-year sentence and a $6,800 fine for
each of three perjury counts.
   Deaver was found guilty last year of lying when he said he
couldn't recall contacting former Reagan administration colleagues
on behalf of major corporations who paid him six-figure fees for
his services.
   Flynn, head of the alcoholism and drug abuse clinic at
Georgetown University Hospital, testified that Deaver
``definitely'' suffered memory and judgment impairments during two
hospital stays for detoxification.
   But on cross-examination, Flynn admitted to independent counsel
Whitney North Seymour Jr. that he never tested Deaver for memory
loss during the hospital stays and meant to say that ``people in
that situation have impaired memory and judgment.''
   Flynn also provided another piece of circumstantial evidence
that Deaver telephoned then-Secretary Elizabeth Dole on behalf of
Trans Word Airlines.
   Deaver was talking on the phone at 5 p.m. June 3, 1985 when he
first entered the former presidential aide's room at the hospital,
Flynn said. A log kept by Mrs. Dole's secretary that was produced
at the trial showed Deaver had called the Cabinet official at
precisely that hour.
   Among other things, Deaver was convicted of lying when he told a
federal grand jury on June 20, 1986 that ``I don't recall any
government contact I made on behalf of TWA.''
   The defense is trying to show that Deaver honestly couldn't
recall the telephone contact because he was drugged and suffering
from alcoholic withdrawal.
   But Flynn, who testified that Deaver later took heavy doses of
the tranquilizer Valium to counteract alcohol withdrawal, said the
former White House aide was neither drunk nor sedated by a dose of
Librium he took 30 minutes earlier.
   The defense countered with Dr. Dolores Morgan, a Miami physician
who treats alcoholics.
   She said medical records showed that by 1985 when Deaver had
resigned from President Reagan's staff his alcoholism had reached
an advanced stage.
   Kidney failure that kept Deaver from attending Reagan's second
inaugural in January 1985 was ``a classic example'' of the medical
complications of alcoholism, she said. It was misdiagnosed as an
allergic reaction to blood-pressure medicine because Deaver didn't
tell doctors he was drinking heavily.
   Morgan said Deaver probably understated his problem when he told
Flynn and other doctors six months later that he had only recently
started drinking more than a fifth of Scotch whisky a day.
   On appeal, the defense is expected to repeat arguments that
improper trial rulings by the judge put Deaver at a strategic
disadvantage that prevented him from testifying.
   The defense, confronted with these rulings from the bench, chose
to rest its case without calling Deaver or any of the medical
experts who were prepared to testify.

<HEAD>Seabrook Finances Now Lone Obstacle To Low-Power License</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission says the idled Seabrook, N.H., reactor will not get a
low-power operating license until regulators are convinced the
plant's owners are financially stable.
   But Seabrook officials, buoyed by a commission vote Friday that
removed the only other regulatory obstacle to gaining the license,
said they will begin immediately preparing the reactor for
low-power testing in anticipation of a license.
   The NRC voted 4-0 for a rules ``clarification'' that will allow
nuclear plants to receive low-power permits without an emergency
siren system in place to alert neighbors within 10 miles of the
reactors of an atomic emergency.
   Commission regulations say financial qualification should not be
a consideration for a low-power license, but NRC Chairman Lando W.
Zech Jr. said there are extenuating circumstances in the Seabrook
case. For the first time, he said, Seabrook's finances would be a
factor in consideration of a low-power license.
   ``It's a serious issue,'' Zech told reporters after the hearing.
``We'll be watching closely to see the financial qualification
situation at Seabrook.''
   Zech's concerns focused on Public Service Company of New
Hampshire, a partial Seabrook owner which filed for bankruptcy
reorganization last January.
   ``In my judgment, bankruptcy is a special case,'' the chairman
said. ``... We should be satisfied that bankruptcy will not prevent
safe, low-power operation.''
   Massachusetts communities within Seabrook's 10-mile zone fought
successfully to have the emergency sirens removed. State officials
led by Gov. Michael Dukakis, the Democratic presidential nominee,
believe those coastal towns, with their narrow roads and bulging
summer populations, would not be able to evacuate quickly. The new
rule takes effect in 30 days.
   Edward Brown, president of the reactor's owner, New Hampshire
Yankee, hailed the commission vote as ``another major step forward
for Seabrook.''
   Dukakis blasted the ruling, saying it ``defies logic and brings
new meaning to the word irresponsible.'' He derided the commission
as the ``Not Responsible Commission'' and said it ``is experiencing
a meltdown in its thinking process.''
   The lone regulatory obstacle remaining for Seabrook's low-power
license is a petition filed by plant opponents charging that the
reactor's owners are financially unfit to operate the plant.
   That question was tentatively scheduled for a vote following the
siren issue, but was postponed.
   The idle $5.6 billion reactor is losing $50 million each month
in maintenance and finance costs.
   Martin Malsch, NRC deputy general counsel, said he hoped the
commission would have the issue resolved within a month.
   Seabrook officials said they were optimistic of a favorable
ruling.
   ``We feel we have proved to the commission that we are
financially qualified,'' said Ronald A. Sher, spokesman for New
Hampshire Yankee.
   If the NRC rules that the Seabrook owners are financially fit,
the plant would be eligible for a low-power license, which allows
it to run tests at 5 percent power.
   The owners need the 5 percent permit before securing a
full-power commercial license, while opponents say low-power
testing would contaminate the reactor with radioactive fuel and
make a future conversion to a gas-fired plant much more expensive.

<HEAD>`Truth-in-Contracting' Rules Loosened By Pentagon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon has slightly relaxed the
``truth-in-contracting'' regulations it imposed after this summer's
disclosure of a massive fraud investigation. But it refused to drop
the rules altogether as industry asked.
   The Pentagon on Friday said its Defense Department Task Force on
Procurement ``has determined that both the Certificate of
Contractor Business Ethics and Integrity and the Profit Recapture
Clause remain necessary to protect the government's interests....''
   The certification and profit recapture regulations were imposed
July 15 against defense contractors named in search warrants
obtained by the Justice Department. Fifteen companies are currently
subject to the special requirements.
   The investigation, which became public in June, concerns
allegations that defense contractors hired outside consultants to
obtain proprietary information on the bids of competing defense
companies, and that the consultants may have paid bribes to
Pentagon employees to get such information.
   The certification clause requires any of the contractors who
receive a contract worth at least $100,000 to certify that they
have not obtained any inside information. The profit recapture
regulation specifies the Pentagon can reclaim profits from any
company that has obtained sensitive information improperly.
   The Pentagon said it was narrowing the application of the
certification rule by specifying the written pledge would be
required only when a contractor is competing with other firms to
start a new project.
   Under the initial version of the rule, if a contractor was on
the Pentagon's list, the requirement was imposed regardless of
whether the contract was sole-source or competitive, and regardless
of whether it was for the start of a project or to expand work
awarded to the company earlier.
   A Pentagon official who asked not to be named said the change
was designed to lighten somewhat industry fears that firms could be
held accountable now for actions that dated back several years.

   Cincinnati's Tom Browning pitched the 14th
perfect game in major league baseball's 108-year history, breezing
past the Los Angeles Dodgers 1-0 Friday night.
   It also was the first no-hitter since the beginning of last
season. Six no-hit bids were broken up this season, including one
by the Reds' Browning.
   A pitcher achieves a perfect game by allowing no batter to reach
base.
   Browning, a 28-year-old left-hander, struck out seven Dodgers.
   In the ninth, Browning completed the game by getting Rick
Dempsey on a fly ball to Paul O'Neill at the warning track in left
field, Steve Sax on a grounder to shortstop and pinch-hitter Tracy
Woodson on a strikeout to end the game.
   The last no-hitter was April 15, 1987, by Milwaukee's Juan
Nieves against the Baltimore Orioles in the American League.
   The last perfect game was by California's Mike Witt, a 1-0
victory over California on Sept. 30, 1984, also in the American
League.
   The National League's last perfect game was Sept. 9, 1965, by
the Dodgers' Sandy Koufax against the Chicago Cubs.

   The Federal Communications Commission is
loosening the regulatory reins on American Telephone & Telegraph
Co. by allowing the long-distance leader to offer special discounts
to business customers.
   The FCC said in a written order Friday that AT&T will be able to
offer special pricing plans for telecommunications services to
respond to individual customers who have been offered lower prices
by competing long-distance companies.
   ``The commission action recognizes the intense level of
competition in the business long-distance market and it allows AT&T
to respond competitively as conditions warrant,'' AT&T said.
   AT&T said the decision was ``good news for all
telecommunications customers'' because it would enable the company
to attract more large-business customers to its networks, ``with
cost savings flowing to all.''
   But AT&T's competitors, including MCI Communications Corp., had
objected to AT&T's pricing plan, saying that if discount pricing
were allowed, AT&T would be able to undercut the competition with
predatory pricing.
   AT&T had proposed the discount pricing plan after Holiday Corp.
told the company it planned to switch its chain of Holiday Inn
hotels to MCI long-distance services unless AT&T could offer a plan
that was priced competitively.
   AT&T, which serves about 70 percent of the long-distance market,
is the only long-distance carrier whose rates are subject to
federal regulation and which must file with the FCC the prices it
charges for its services. Other carriers can set their prices below
AT&T's and offer customers special discounted packages of services
to individual customers.
   The agency's action allows AT&T to offer a pricing plan for
Holiday Corp. that will provide long-distance services to Holiday
Inns at rates 5 percent to 10 percent below AT&T's PRO America II
service, which is offered to other business cutomers.
   The Holiday plan will be allowed to go into effect today, but
the FCC will conduct an investigation and is requiring the company
to keep separate accounts of the costs and revenues generated by
the account to assure that other AT&T ratepayers will not be
subsidizing the discounts for Holiday, the FCC said.
   As part of the investigation, the FCC said it would consider
whether the pricing plan can be justified under the 1934
Communications Act, which prohibits telephone companies from
offering rates that are unreasonably or unduly discriminatory among
its customers.
   The commission said it would conclude the investigation promptly
but set no deadline.
   Commissioner Patricia Dennis, one of the three sitting FCC
commissioners, dissented from the decision, saying she objected to
allowing AT&T to put its Holiday pricing plan into effect until the
investigation was completed.
   She said she questioned whether the Holiday pricing plan was
legal. ``There is a strong likelihood that the commission is
allowing an unreasonably discriminatory and unlawful tariff to take
effect,'' she said.

   A mix-up between the National Park Service, a
Ukrainian group, and organizers of a massive quilt memorializing
people who have died of AIDS is causing logistical problems in the
nation's capital.
   Organizers of the Names Project, a 16-ton quilt bearing 10,000
names of AIDS victims, thought everything was set for the site of
their Oct. 8 ceremony, in which the quilt is to be displayed and
the names read.
   But the Park Service instead promised use of the Ellipse, a
circular lawn behind the White House, to a group of Ukrainians who
plan to hold a rally and march to celebrate 1,000 years of
Christianity the same day.
   The Ukrainians say moving would cause them too many logistical
problems, and the Park Service says it can't order a group to
relocate without a compelling reason involving public safety.
   ``The problem is that we can't force any group to move, even
though that would be the simple solution in this case. But we'd
never have suggested it to the Ukrainians if we knew the Names
Project wanted it,'' said Sandra Alley, assistant regional director
for public affairs of the Park Service. She said she the Ukrainians
are considering moving to another location.
   ``We've put together our program based on the site, we've
advertised it in our community and we're expecting 15,000 people
and to move now would be a real problem,'' said Eugene Iwanciw,
organizer of the Ukrainian Millenium Celebration.
   Names Project organizers say other sites are inadequate.
   The mix-up resulted when demonstration and project organizers
had to go through a third party to book the site.

<HEAD>Shultz Says Israel Must End Occupation; Rejects Palestinian State</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said an
Arab-Israeli peace depends on the Palestinians dropping their
demand for an independent state and Israel ending its military
control of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Speaking Friday on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the Camp
David accords, Shultz rejected a proposal by Yasser Arafat,
chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, that Israel be
forced to withdraw to the lines of partition approved by the United
Nations before the Jewish state was established in 1948.
   ``Israel will never negotiate from or return to the lines of
partition,'' Shultz said in remarks prepared for a Mideast
conference at the Wye plantation near Queenstown, Md.
   ``But it must be prepared to withdraw _ as Resolution 242 says _
from territories occupied in the recent conflict,'' Shultz said.
``Peace and security for all sides are at stake.''
   He quoted from the resolution approved by the U.N. Security
Council at the end of the 1967 Mideast war. It does not
specifically call on Israel to give up all the territory the Arabs
lost _ and nor did Shultz.
   But he also did not call for Israel's retention of any of the
land, which includes the eastern half of Jerusalem that has become
part of Israel's capital.
   The speech had the earmarks of a valedictory. Shultz spoke of
``fundamental constants'' that he suggested the next administration
consider in seeking an Arab-Israeli settlement.
   The first point was that ``the status quo serves the interest of
no party'' and that peace in the region depends on an agreement
between Palestinians and Israelis.
   On the Arab side, Shultz gave high priority to the Palestinians
and referred almost in passing to Jordan whose King Hussein this
summer abandoned any claim to represent the 1.4 million
Palestinians who live on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   ``Palestinians need to achieve rapid control over political and
economic decisions that affect their lives,'' Shultz said.
``Israelis need time to adjust to a new situation, one in which
Palestinians _ not Israeli military government officials _
administer the West Bank and Gaza.''
   He rejected the position taken by some Israelis that since
Palestinians form a clear majority of Jordan's population the
country should become their state while Israel retains the West
Bank.
   ``Jordan is a vibrant and heterogenous society, with a strong
national identity of its own,'' Shultz said. ``It is not a
Palestinian state.''
   He said Palestinians have a right to participate actively in
every stage of negotiations and ``must approve the outcome.''
   At the same time, Shultz called on Palestinians to pursue
credible goals.
   ``The status of the West Bank and Gaza cannot be determined by
unilateral acts of either side, but only through a process of
negotiations,'' Shultz said.
   ``A declaration of independent Palestinian statehood or
government-in-exile would be such a unilateral act,'' he said.
   In four trips to the Middle East this year Shultz was unable to
set up Mideast peace talks. Palestinians, under Arafat's
instructions, boycotted his attempts to meet with them.
   Hussein demanded a commitment from Israel that it would give up
the West Bank and Gaza, while Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
opposed the peace conference Shultz proposed because it might give
an influential role to the Soviet Union.
   In the speech, Shultz backed off. He said a peace conference
``may'' be necessary and stressed a need for direct negotiations
among the parties.
   Asked if Shultz would return to the Middle East before leaving
office in January, a State Department official who insisted on
anonymity said: ``I don't see that right now.''

<HEAD>Complaints Lead Sub Base To Pull Fonda Tapes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GROTON, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jane Fonda's exercise videotapes were
pulled from the shelves of the Naval Submarine Base retail store
because of complaints over her anti-Vietnam War activities, a base
spokesman said.
   ``It reflects the consumer concern and nothing more,'' said Lt.
Cmdr. Jack Ward. Only two or three copies of several different
titles were removed, he said.
   One of the two complaints came from Gaetano A. Russo, a retired
major general of the Connecticut National Guard who organized
anti-Fonda protests of a movie she filmed in Waterbury.
   Russo said he walked into the store and saw a Fonda tape being
played on a video recorder.
   ``I told them it was an insult to every American that ever
lived,'' Russo said Friday.
   John W. Pillar, a member of the Groton Representative Town
Meeting, said he also complained to Navy authorities about the
tapes.
   During a 1972 visit to Hanoi, Fonda broadcast a radio message in
which she said some American weapons were illegal. She also was
photographed next to a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun.
   Fonda apologized this summer on national television to veterans
who may have been hurt by her actions, but her effort at
reconciliation was rejected by both the American Legion and the
Veterans of Foreign Wars.
   Stephen M. Rivers, a spokesman for the actress in Los Angeles,
said he was surprised that the tapes were removed because of only
two complaints, particularly because the military's job ``is to
defend and protect our freedoms.''
   ``We have all the right to opinions, to express them, and
(should) respect the rights of those who don't agree with us,''
Rivers said.

   An Ohio man sitting in a downtown

making threatening remarks against Vice President George Bush on
the day of Bush's visit in the city.
   Police said Charles T. Rode Jr., 35, of Findlay allegedly made
threatening comments at approximately 9 a.m. Friday shortly before
Bush's arrival in this northwest Ohio city. Police and Secret
Service agents arrested Rode, who did not resist and was not
carrying a weapon, officials said.
   Rode was detained in Findlay until Bush left the city, and then
was taken to the Lucas County jail in Toledo, where he was being
held today without bond on a felony charge of threatening the vice
president.
   Bush was in Findlay for a half-hour speech during the city's

<HEAD>Polls Favor Governing Party But Indicate Greens May Gain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Final pre-election polls indicated
Sweden's Social Democratic Party stands a good chance to stay in
office, but the environmentalist Greens may win seats and a role as
a legislative power broker.
   Sweden's high taxes and welfare system and the non-socialist
opposition's ability to govern were chief issues in a television
and radio debate Friday that analysts said could tip the balance in
Sunday's election.
   Ten percent of voters questioned this week said they were still
undecided.
   Young Greens supporters demonstrated outside the television
studio hall because their party was excluded from the broadcast
debate. Swedish public television said it was open only to
incumbent parties.
   The Greens failed to clear the 4 percent minimum for legislative
representation in the two previous elections they contested, but
this summer's ecological disasters and general discontent among
young voters have boosted their chances for seats _ and perhaps a
role in a coalition government.
   The five parliamentary party leaders all stressed the
environment in opening statements, but in the ensuing debate
concentrated on calls for more housing and improved retiree, health
and child-care benefits.
   A poll by the Swedish Institute of Public Research, or SIPO,
forecast that Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson's Social Democrats and
the small Communist Party would win a combined 46.2 percent of the
vote.
   The three non-socialist parties polled a total 44.6 percent in
the survey of 1,094 people taken from Monday through Thursday. The
balance between the two blocs was taken by the Environment Party,
or Greens, with 7.1 percent. The margin of error was about 2
percent, said institute director Bert Levin.
   Another poll of 1,500 people by the IMU institute forecast a
49.2 percent total for the Social Democrats and Communists, enough
to make the governing bloc independent of the Greens.
   A third poll by the SEMKA institute forecast a more even
situation outcome, with 45.6 percent for the socialist bloc and
44.1 for the non-socialists. The Greens polled 6.9 percent.
   Carlsson repeatedly questioned what he called the non-socialist
opposition's lack of a joint platform, referring to internal
quarrels that split their coalition governments in 1976-82.
   ``Voters alas have not received an answer about the
non-socialist so-called government alternative,'' Carlsson said.
``You may wake up Monday morning and have a policy you do not have
a clue about.''
   Conservative Party leader Carl Bildt said the Conservatives,
Liberals and Center parties had ``presented their aims.''
   In the only reference to foreign policy, Bildt called for a
Swedish entry into the European Market, while Carlsson said Sweden
should cooperate with the EEC ``except on foreign and defense
policy,'' citing Sweden's neutrality.
   Also absent were references to the ``Carlsson affair,'' the
Social Democrats' attempt with the help of publisher turned private
detective Ebbe Carlsson to investigate leads in the 1986
assassination of former Prime Minister Olof Palme.
   The private investigation, undertaken without the knowledge of
Swedish authorities, forced Minister of Justice Anna Greta Leijon
to resign last June.
   The socialist bloc won a majority of 50.1 percent in the 1985
election to the 349-seat Riksdag, or parliament. Social Democratic
leaders have said the party would stay in office as a minority
government if it could.
   Their ability to govern would be in doubt if the Communists fail
to pass the 4 percent barrier and drop out of the legislature. The
SIFO poll gave the Communists 4.2 percent, an edge that could be
wiped out by the margin of error.
   Both blocs have said they would not rely on the Greens to form a
government.
   The Social Democrats have governed Sweden for 50 of the last 56
years with the support of smaller parties.
   Normal voter turnout is about 90 percent of Sweden's 6.3 million
eligible voters.

   Iraq has rejected a U.N. bid to send a
team of experts to investigate allegations it used poison gas
against Kurdish rebels, many of whom have fled to neighboring
Turkey.
   ``The response was negative,'' Iraq's Acting U.N. Ambassador,
Ali Mahmoud Sumaida, told reporters Friday after meeting with
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar. ``We declined to receive
such a mission because there is no basis for evidence (for such a
mission).''
   At least a dozen nations, including the United States and
Britain, have urged Perez de Cuellar to send a team to look into
charges that Iraq was using chemical warfare against its Kurdish
minority.
   Sumaida said reports by a Turkish team of experts and the
Turkish Red Crescent _ Turkey's equivalent of the Red Cross _ did
not provide sufficient evidence to warrant dispatching a team of
investigators.
   Perez de Cuellar did not issue an immediate response to the
Iraqi rejection.

<TEXT>
   Here are some comments Friday from the
presidential campaign trail:
   
   GEORGE BUSH, mocking Dukakis for trying to show his national
security prowess by riding in a tank: ``The tank did not fit. You
cannot fool the Soviet leadership by knocking America's defense for
10 years and then riding around in a tank for 10 minutes.''
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, criticizing Bush's lack of leadership in the
war against drugs: ``George Bush was supposed to be in charge of
that war, and we all know what happened ... You know, if you don't
show up at school, you fail, and if you don't show up at your job
as chief officer of the war on drugs, you fail, the American people
lose, and the drug lords take over.''
   
   LLOYD BENTSEN, saying that Bush has failed to speak out against
questionable Reagan administration policies and: ``When George Bush
speaks out against Mike Dukakis. We should all remember that when
it came to speaking out against arms to Iran, when it came to
speaking out against cozy deals with Gen. (Manuel Antonio) Noriega
of Panama, when it came to speaking out against economic policies
that have almost tripled the national debt, George Bush didn't
speak, he just voted present.''
   
   DAN QUAYLE, chiding Dukakis for waffling on defense issues, and
harkening back to the Massachusetts governor's earlier suggestion
that farmers solve their economic woes by growing Belgian endive:
``I decided to sum it up this way: His farm policy is the Belgian
endive and his defense policy is the Belgian waffle.''

   Actor Tom Selleck says he fulfilled a childhood
dream by going to bat with the Baltimore Orioles and hitting two
home runs.
   The former ``Magnum P.I.'' star spent most of the summer in the
Baltimore area on location for ``Her Alibi,'' a romantic comedy
film in which he plays a mystery writer who becomes involved with a
murder suspect.
   Filming for the movie, which also stars model Paulina Porizkova,

   The highlight of the summer was the day Selleck went to batting
practice with the Baltimore Orioles at Memorial Stadium, where he
hit two home runs, he said.
   ``It was about 120 degrees on the field. I had a great time,''
said Selleck, who played baseball in college. ``They helped my

   He said he plans to appear in several more movies, but will take
a five- or six-month hiatus first to spend time with his wife and
baby.
   ``I need to get away from the business,'' he said.

   Suzanne Blum, the lawyer who represented the Duke
and Duchess of Windsor for 40 years, said she was fulfilling the
duchess' wishes when she allowed the couple's private letters to be
published, a newspaper reported.
   But the Daily Telegraph on Friday said Mohammed al-Fayed, an
Egyptian businessman who has bought the duchess' house in Paris,
has challenged Ms. Blum's authority to publish the letters and is
demanding she return them.
   He claims Ms. Blum took the letters and other papers from the
house during the duchess' final illness and immediately after her
death in 1986, a charge Ms. Blum denies.
   Some of the correspondence was recently included in books by
Michael Bloch, Ms. Blum's protege.
   One book, ``The Secret File of the Duke of Windsor,'' revealed
that the former King Edward VIII, who abdicated the British throne
in 1936 to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson, referred to
Queen Elizabeth II as ``Mrs. Temple Junior,'' and ``Shirley.''
   Ms. Blum, 89, told the newspaper she was given the letters by
the duchess, who wrote a letter authorizing Ms. Blum to publish
them.

   The local YMCA has a new building,
thanks in part to two of the area's residents, King Hassan II of
Morocco and former Rep. Millicent Fenwick.
   The $3.5 million building was dedicated last week, when it was
revealed that the king donated $100,000 to the cause.
   Hassan, who lives part of the year on a 493-acre, $7.5 million
Tudor mansion in nearby Peapack-Gladstone, is rarely seen by
neighbors.
   But Fenwick, who got to know the Moroccan ambassador in Rome
during her own service there as an ambassador to a United Nations
agency, wrote the diplomat a letter asking if the king would
contribute money for a new building.
   ``He was enthusiastic. I was amazed,'' Fenwick, a Bernardsville
resident, said Thursday. ``He said that is just the kind of thing
the king is interested in.''
   Robert Ohaus, a member of the YMCA's board of directors, said
the king gave them a check last year made out in Arabic. ``All we
could read was the $100,000, but that was enough.''

   The Senate has reiterated its overwhelming
support of the Reagan administration's contention that a giant
Soviet radar system violates the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
   ``These violations are a threat to the security of the United
States,'' said Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., author of the
resolution that won 81-0 approval after only brief debate on the
issue Friday.
   It was the third vote in two years on the issue. The earlier
votes were 89-0 and 93-2.
   The dispute involves the Soviet radar station at Krasnoyarsk,
which the United States has argued is a violation of the 1972 pact
limiting defensive systems that each superpower can build. The
Soviets dispute the U.S. contention.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, without admitting any
violation, had proposed earlier in the day the Russians would be
willing to allow the radar station to be used as an international
space tracking system as part of an exchange for U.S. closure of
military bases in the Phillippines.
   The Senate's non-binding resolution said the radar station
question should be settled before there are any new U.S.-Soviet
agreements on limiting long-range atomic weapons.

<TEXT>
   Hurricane Gilbert slammed the
Texas-Mexico coast with heavy rain, high waves and tornadoes
Friday, and thousands of Gulf Coast residents fled inland or
huddled in public shelters and boarded-up homes.
   Heavy rain fell on this southernmost Texas city and wind gusts
to 62 mph were measured at the airport and to 65 mph at Port
Isabel. Up to 5 inches of rain was forecast, along with tides 7 to
11 feet above normal.
   Nearly two dozen tornadoes were reported around Brownsville as
Gilbert made its way ashore, overturning cars and mobile homes and
tearing the roofs from buildings. Some injuries but no deaths were
reported.
   Police in nearby Harlingen said the windows of 20 to 30 cars in
a parking lot were shattered by high winds or a tornado. Low-lying
coastal roads were closed by high water.
   A Coast Guard helicopter rescued the crews of three fishing
boats run aground in the storm-tossed Gulf of Mexico, plucking five
people from a 70-foot fishing boat and found the crew of its sister
boat beached near Port Isabel.
   The Coast Guard also rescued a third missing boat and crew in
Matagorda Bay. ``We're just full of happy endings today, which is
great with a storm like this,'' said Petty Officer Bob Morehead.
   At 11 p.m. CDT, the center of the storm was near latitude 24.6
north and longitude 98.6 west, or about 115 miles southwest of
Brownsville. Its highest sustained winds had slackened to 105 mph.
   Gilbert, which for a time earlier this week was the most
powerful storm on record in the Western Hemisphere, weakened
somewhat but remained a dangerous storm, responsible for at least
70 deaths and billions of dollars in damage as it roared across the
Caribbean and through the Gulf of Mexico.
   The calm eye at the heart of the hurricane made landfall about
120 miles south of Brownsville at 4:35 p.m. CDT, in Tamaulipas
state, said Mark Zimmer, meteorologist at the National Hurricane
Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
   It was moving west-northwest at about 12 mph, and was expected
to follow that track through mid-day Saturday, before turning
gradually to the northwest, forecasters said.
   ``The rain was blowing sideways,'' said Ruth Wooddell, who chose
to ride out the storm in her home Saturday.
   By 11 p.m., hurricane warnings for the Texas coast from Port
O'Connor to Brownsville were downgraded to a high wind warning, but
coastal flood warnings were posted for the entire Texas coast.
   ``The danger of flash flooding in Texas is very great. Rainfall
as high as 10 to 15 inches _ maybe even 20 inches _ is expected,''
Zimmer said.
   Remnants of Gilbert should bring very heavy rains this weekend
to Rio Grande valley of Texas before heading north up the
Mississippi River Valley as a ``huge rain-making machine,'' Zimmer
said.
   Hurricane-force winds should end by early Saturday. By mid-week,
the storm should be in lower Ohio River Valley. ``Gilbert will last
be heard of as a rain storm somewhere in the Great Lakes,'' he said.
   The eye passed over Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz, two small Mexican
villages a few miles north of La Pesca, which has a population of
about 500, said Mark Zimmer, meteorologist at the National
Hurricane Center.
   The mayor of Soto la Marina, 20 miles inland from La Pesca, was
contacted by The Associated Press as the storm struck his town of
8,000 residents.
   Mayor Hinojosa Cortina said the town's situation Marina was
``getting worse with every passing minute. There are very strong
winds. It's all dark. There is no electricity and no water. Trees
have been uprooted.''
   Cortina said some residents had fled the town in advance of the
hurricane but many remained. Other town officials said 3,000 people
from fishing villages along the coast were given shelter in Soto la
Marina.
   Monterrey, an industrial city with a population of about 3
million, is the closest major city that could be affected. It is
210 miles northwest of La Pesca, but protected by the small
mountain range of the Sierra de Tamaulipas.
   Zimmer said the range should break up circulation of hurricane
winds and accelerate drop in wind speed, which naturally occurs
when storm moves over land. But he also said very heavy rains could
cause flash floods and mudslides.
   Thousands of people also evacuated in neighboring areas of
northeastern Mexico, including the entire beach area of Matamoros,
a city of 280,000 just across the border, which includes posh
vacation homes, restaurants and small fishing villages, officials
said.
   Many streets in Matamoros were flooded and officials said about
5,000 people fled their homes in low-lying coastal areas. Winds of
35 mph, gusting as high as 57 mph, knocked out power to the city.
   ``Up to now the damages are not considered very grave,'' said
Jose Inez Gonzalez, a city spokesman. He said officials distributed
crackers and water to thousands of people in shelters and urged
them to stay until the storm ended.
   To the south, about 300,000 people were homeless in Yucatan
State and 10,000 more were homeless in Campeche, on the west coast
of the peninsula, the government news agency Notimex said.
   Violent weather surrounding the hurricane spun off more than a
half-dozen tornadoes over the Brownsville area Friday, blowing over
at least two homes and slightly injuring one person. Gilbert's
influence extended far across the Gulf and thunderstorms that were
part of its circulation spawned tornadoes in Alabama.
   The roof was ripped from a Brownsville apartment complex and
windows were blown out. Police in nearby Harlingen said the windows
of 20-30 cars in a parking lot were shattered by high wind or a
tornado.
   Despite the danger of flying debris, Robert Rios, 16, was
skateboarding down Brownsville's International Boulevard when the
storm neared its peak.
   ``There's a lot of movement and it's fun,'' Rios said. ``I know
it's dangerous. I've fallen down a couple of times but it's just a
thrill.''
   Some 125 shelters holding 50,000 people were open in a
four-county area of southern Texas around Brownsville, American Red
Cross spokeswoman Barbara Lohman said.
   An estimated 25,000 people evacuated as a precaution in southern
Louisiana, as did about 40 percent of the 65,000 residents of the
island city of Galveston, but most people in those two areas were
allowed to return home Friday when the storm's track seemed certain
to avoid them.
   Brownsville resembled a ghost town Friday, with many of its
100,000 residents having fled to schools, auditoriums and churches.
Electrical power was out in some areas and sporadic in others.
   But city spokeswoman Pam Downing estimated at least 50 percent
of Brownsville's residents live at or below the poverty line and
could not afford to leave.
   ``Obviously, we have those that live in substandard housing and
they have no way of getting out of here,'' she said. ``And if they
do get out of town, the cost of supplies would be too much and
their finances basically force them to stay here.''
   Police fanned out in colonias _ where people live in
metal-roofed, plywood shacks _ to make certain residents had left.
   ``We don't want to panic anybody but we wanted to tell them that
if they did not get out now, it would be very difficult to get out
later,'' police Sgt. Dean Poos said as officers went through a
flood-prone area of town known as Southmost, about 20 miles from
the Gulf along the Rio Grande.
   Mayor Ygnacio Garza at mid-day halted police from warning people
to leave.
   Tornadoes and flooding by then made travel too dangerous, said
Hidalgo County Sheriff's Department spokesman Rene Torres. ``People
are being advised to just stay where they're at and ride the storm
through,'' he said.
   Downing estimated only 20 percent of the residents had left town.
   ``We didn't want to go anywhere but here anyway,'' Ramon
Cardenas, 78, said while he and his invalid wife, Maria, waited out
the storm at a public shelter. ``Our house is pretty old. We left
everything in there. If it falls, we know it doesn't have to go
very far, but I don't know what we'll do if it is damaged.''
   One Texas drowning was indirectly related to the hurricane. A
3-year-old boy fell from his family's shrimp boat when they moved
the vessel for safe mooring, said Calhoun County Sheriff's
spokesman Rick Prush.
   The Coast Guard rescued 16 people from three fishing boats, two
near Port Isabel and one in Matagorda Bay.
   Gov. Bill Clements sent National Guard units to McAllen, Alice
and Corpus Christi.

   Hurricane Gilbert powered into Mexico's
eastern coast Friday for the second time in three days, forcing
thousands of residents from their homes after killing at least 21
people on the Yucatan Peninsula.
   Heavy rains from the storm also drowned eight people in
Honduras, where officials said about 6,000 people were homeless and
27,000 acres of crops were destroyed.
   The eye of the hurricane crossed onto land at 5:35 p.m. EDT
(4:35 p.m. CDT), sweeping ashore 120 miles south of Brownsville,
Texas, the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla., said in
a statement. Brownsville is just across the Rio Grande from
Matamoros, a city of 280,000 people.
   Gilbert _ a 450-mile-wide hurricane with winds of 120 mph _ made
landfall just north of La Pesca, a fishing village on the Gulf of
Mexico. The coastal plain in that zone is sparsely populated.
   The confirmed Mexico death toll rose to 21, Jorge Galicia of the
National Civil Defense System told The Associated Press early
Saturday. All occurred in the three Yucatan peninsula states of
Campeche, Yucatan and Quintana Roo.
   Authorities said Friday that 10 people were missing in the
Yucatan state.
   The mayor of Soto la Marina, 20 miles inland from La Pesca, was
contacted by The Associated Press as the storm struck his town of
8,000 residents.
   Mayor Hinojosa Cortina said the situation in Soto la Marina was
``getting worse with every passing minute. There are very strong
winds. It's all dark. There is no electricity and no water. Trees
have been uprooted.''
   Cortina said some residents had fled the town in advance of the
hurricane but many remained. Other town officials said 3,000 people
from fishing villages along the coast were given shelter in Soto la
Marina.
   Many streets in Matamoros were flooded and officials said about
5,000 people fled their homes in low-lying coastal areas.
   At 9 p.m. EDT (8 p.m. CDT), the eye of the hurricane was near
latitude 24.4 north, longitude 98.1 west, or about 110 miles south
southwest of Brownsville, the National Hurricane Center said.
   It said Gilbert was moving toward the west-northwest at 12 mph.
The report said flash floods and tides of 7 to 11 feet above normal
were expected near and to the north of where the storm came ashore.
   Monterrey, an industrial city with a population of about three
million, is the closest major city that could be affected. It is
210 miles northwest of La Pesca but Sierra de Tamaulipas, a small
mountain range between Monterrey and the coast, should blunt the
hurricane's strentth, said Mark Zimmer, a meterologist at National
Hurricane Center.
   He said the range should break up circulation of hurricane and
accelerate drop in wind speed, which naturally occurs when storm
moves over land. But Zimmer said he expects very heavy rains as
warm hurricane winds rise into cooler mountain air. This could
cause flash floods and mudslides, he said.
   The hurricane struck the Mexican coast first Wednesday morning,
roaring into the Yucatan Peninsula.
   About 300,000 people were homeless in Yucatan State and 10,000
more were homeless in Campeche on the west coast of the peninsula,
the government news agency Notimex said.
   The mayor of Cancun, on the east coast of the peninsula, said
11,000 tourists and residents were evacuated from beachfront areas
before the storm hit.
   Power and communications were still out in much of Yucatan,
thousands of people remained in shelters, many areas were flooded
and transportation was only partially restored.
   The Cancun and Cozumel airports opened Friday, allowing 8,000
tourists to begin leaving the popular Caribbean resorts.
   The damage ``looks awesome and spectacular,'' Tourism Secretary
Antonio Enriquez Savignac said during an appearance on the private
Televisa network Friday after returning from a flight over the area.
   Matamoros, only 25 feet above sea level and 12 miles from shore,
lacks natural wind breaks such as hills or high buildings.
Authorities said their main worry was flooding, which already
affected some streets.
   Officials said about 5,000 people spent Thursday night in
shelters. Countless others already have fled the city for towns
farther inland, while thousands waited out the hurricane behind
boarded or taped doors and windows.
   ``Our house started flooding, so we called the police and they
brought us here,'' said Maria Crecencia Vazquez, a 45-year-old
mother of 10 who sought shelter in a church meeting hall, one of
126 shelters set up in Matamoros.
   The refugees, mostly poor families, said they spent all night
Thursday in the shelters without food or blankets.
   ``They closed a lot of stores because too many people were
packing in,'' said Jose Padilla, 29. ``Most of us didn't get any
food.''
   The Matamoros airport was closed at midmorning.
   About 100 miles south of La Pesca, heavy winds and rains pounded
the oil port of Tampico where 30 ships were anchored. Power was cut
in some areas and the airport and coastal highway were closed,
according to El Sol de Tampico, the local paper.
   Nearly 1,000 miles away from Matamoros, across the Gulf of
Mexico, much of the Yucatan Peninsula was in tatters.
   Glbert caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damages as it
rolled across three states of the peninsula destroying 90 per cent
of the corn and fruit crops.
   But tourism officials were optimistic they could put Cancun and
Cozumel back in working order in six weeks, in time for the height
of the fall and winter season.

<HEAD>Another Body Part Found in Ohio River</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note contents</NOTE>
<DATELINE>EAST LIVERPOOL, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sixth human body part has been
found in the Ohio River, and medical examiners say it appears the
victim, a young woman, was shot before her body was cut into
segments with a power saw.
   The latest grisly discovery, made late Thursday, came near East
Liverpool where four other parts have been discovered, said Tracy
Dulaney, a spokeswoman for the Hancock County, W.Va., Sheriff's
department, which is handling the investigation.
   Hancock County Coroner Dr. Reynaldo Vista identified the latest
part as a right hip. He said Friday he believes a puncture on the
left side of the torso was caused by a small-caliber bullet.
   On Wednesday, barge workers found a fifth part, the victim's
right arm, wedged between two coal barges when they stopped near
Kenova, W.Va. The limb could have been picked up by the barge as
far upstream as Pittsburgh, said West Virginia Medical Examiner
Irwin Sopher.
   The gruesome search began Sunday, when a fisherman between
Chester, W.Va., and East Liverpool snagged his hook on a garbage
bag, reeled it in and found a left human arm inside.
   The next day, Hancock County officials searching the river
downstream from where West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvana borders
meet found more bags containing a thigh, part of a torso and a
section of buttocks.
   The parts appear to have been severed with a type of power saw,
and had been in the water up to 10 or 12 days, Sopher said.
   The victim was a short, white woman in her early 20s, he said.
Authorities are matching her with the descriptions of about five
women reported missing recently from Pennsylvania and Ohio.
   ``The main focus now is getting an ID on the body,'' Sopher said.
   Medical authorities earlier this week said they would attempt to
make an identification through the FBI from fingerprints of a left
hand.

   Sam Donovan, ace billboard painter,
is juggling paint brushes and cans on a narrow board that dangles
high above a swampy bog.
   ``You won't believe this, but I'm scared to death of heights,''
said Donovan, 36, who has acquired a reputation for creating
portraits that loom many times larger than life.
   Donovan's life work is art usually seen at a great distance in a
fleeting glance from a car window. Instead of an appreciative
museum audience, he can hope to impress only the myriad of passing
travelers, such as casino tourists and truckers.
   His labors may last only a few days before being covered by the
next advertisement. But the affable artist says he doesn't mind.
   ``I enjoy looking at it for a couple of weeks. If I really like
it, I'll deliberately pass it every day on my way to work just to
see it,'' Donovan said.
   Billboard painting requires a combination of the agility to
climb rickety planks leading to the billboard, the talent to
translate a tiny photograph into a mural hundreds of times larger
and the pluck to endure rain, snow, sleet and heavy winds.
   Donovan says he will paint almost anything on a billboard, but
he especially enjoys assignments involving portraits.
   One day recently, he spent six hours painting Frank Sinatra's
face, right down to the famous blue eyes.
   ``With an older person like him, you have a lot more wrinkles
and that's more time-consuming,'' he said, wiping the paint off his
hands and onto his splattered flannel shirt and jeans.
   ``When I painted Miss New Jersey last week, her face was a lot
easier because it's smooth,'' he said. ``But she had all that red
hair.''
   The job started on a whim. After majoring in biology in college,
Donovan grew restless and took a job painting small signs 10 years
ago. Eventually, he started painting billboards for the R.C.
Maxwell Co.
   He began doing portraits slowly, reading art books and
practicing with watercolors at home.
   Now an independent billboard painter, Donovan is considered
``the best,'' said George Harvey, general manager of R.C. Maxwell's
office here.
   ``He showed great promise early on,'' Harvey said. ``He expanded
his talents so well and so quickly. He soon was thirsting for more
intricate layouts.''
   Donovan acknowledges that good billboard painters are hard to
find.
   ``Very few people set out to say, `I'm going to be a billboard
painter,''' he said. ``There aren't that many of us because you
have to be good to get a job, and there's no place to learn this.''
   A job begins with Donovan charting out the photograph on a sheet
of graph paper, which he then copies in pencil onto his giant
``canvas.'' He next fills in the colors, a tricky process that
involves compensating for the changing light at different times of
the day.
   During the process, he'll climb down the narrow planks quite
frequently to walk several hundred yards away and evaluate the
billboard through binoculars.
   Unlike billboards that are simply made of paper pasted onto the
wood, a hand-painted billboard can last several years if varnished,
Donovan said.
   Donovan recalls only one instance in which he almost fell off a
billboard. The pulleys gave way, and he scrambled for a line to
catch.
   Sheepishly, Donovan also admitted that a few paint cans have
escaped his grip.
   ``I've dropped paint on the Boardwalk on a brand new awning, and
I've even hit a few mink stoles, but they probably never knew where
it came from.''

<HEAD>Rebels Burst Into Court Building and Free Five Comrades; One
Hostage Killed</HEAD>

   Armed left-wing rebels burst into a
federal court building, freed five jailed comrades and abducted a
judge's assistant, who was later found shot to death, police said.
   They said the guerrillas fired automatic weapons as they entered
the building in the town of Buga, 160 miles southwest of Bogota.
   Police said they captured two of the guerrillas freed in the
attack after an hourlong chase. The body of the hostage was found
beside a highway outside of town, police said.
   They did not report any other casualties or further elaborate.
   In other developments, leftist rebels freed 22 government
soldiers and policemen captured in a northwestern Colombia raid
last month and also released two Colombian geologists seized in
another attack, the government and military announced.
   The soldiers and policemen freed Friday had been taken prisoner
Aug. 23 by guerrillas of the People's Liberation Army and the
Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces during a joint attack on the
town of Saiza.
   A statement from President Virgilio Barcos's office said a
one-day cease-fire had been arranged so the captives could be
released in the Uraba region, about 300 miles northwest of Bogota.
   Two of the government troopers had been wounded in the rocket
and mortar attack on the police station in Saiza, Gen. Jesus Arias
said in an interview with the radio station RCN. He did not
elaborate.
   The two geologists released Thursday were among five who worked
with coal companies and were kidnapped Aug. 20 by rebels of another
guerrilla group, the National Liberation Army, or ELN.
   Rebels freed the two geologists in an arranged meeting with a
group of reporters in the city of Bucaramanga, 200 miles northeast
of Bogota.
   An ELN statement said the three other geologists would be
released soon.
   A Defense Ministry communique released Friday said 1,174 people
have been killed this year in guerrilla attacks and battles between
rebels and security forces.
   It listed the slain as 499 guerrillas, 378 civilians and 297
policemen and soldiers.
   The ministry has reported 2,037 people were killed last year in
fighting involving rebels, government forces and civilians caught
in the violence.

   A 31-year-old man seen swaying on the

spend 45 days in jail after pleading guilty to drunken driving.
   Oscar Fincham of Ellicott City took up horseback riding to get
around after previous drunk-driving convictions caused him to lose
his license, his lawyer, J. Michael Lawlor, said Friday.
   Fincham was not aware drunk driving laws applied to horseback
riders, Lawylor said.
   Fincham was arrested in July after police spotted him riding
somewhat uncertainly on the back of a brown mare on a crowded
sidewalk in Ellicott City.

   Leapfrogging questions over the morality of
abortion, an advisory panel has concluded that federal researchers
should be allowed to use fetal tissue in their quest for effective
treatment for Parkinson's and other diseases.
   The leaders of a National Institutes of Health special panel
convened to consider the topic complimented their colleagues Friday
for focusing on questions put to them by top officials of the
Department of Health and Human Services.
   Left unresolved was whether a proposed White House ban on using
the remains of fetuses intentionally and legally aborted in such
experimental treatments will be upheld during the waning months of
the Reagan administration.
   Also unanswered was whether President Reagan is throwing his
personal political weight behind the proposal, which was circulated
for private review by administration health officials.
   The NIH panel voted late Friday _ 19-0, with two abstentions _
to ``recommend that research proceed.''
   Retired federal appellate Judge Arlin M. Adams of Philadelphia,
the special committee's chairman, indicated at a news conference
that he and some other panel members personally were opposed to
abortion but did not let that enter into their decision to
recommend that the government not stand in the way of using legally
obtained fetal remains for research.
   Defending the panel against allegations from anti-abortionists
that the makeup of the panel was stacked in favor of allowing the
research, Adams told reporters that an examination of his opinions
as a judge would show that he was ``very concerned about abortion''
himself.
   ``I didn't know how I was going to vote until I had heard the
testimony,'' said Adams, who was one of the 19.
   Dr. Kenneth J. Ryan, head of the department of obstetrics and
gynecology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, acknowledged
that the fundamental question of the morality of abortion was a
factor.
   ``It seemed to me that the abortion question was in the
background, hovering over us all the time,'' said Ryan, chairman of
the scientific issues portion of the committee deliberations. ``But
I thought the panelists were so intellectually honest with
themselves that they made every effort to divorce the abortion
question ... wherever possible from the question of whether you
could use the product of abortion.
   ``I think that was really the key of the entire three-day
discussion: Could you divorce the two. Some people think you cannot.
   ``I suspect that most of the people on the panel believed
honestly ... that you could, with necessary safeguards, make a
cleavage between the two questions.''
   Sensitive to those concerns, the committee extensively discussed
what type of safeguards should be recommended. Indeed, the
discussion ran so long, the panel will meet again before completing
its work and forwarding its formal, written recommendations to a
standing NIH advisory committee by Dec. 1.
   It did agree that ``a pregnant woman should not be induced to
terminate pregnancy in order to furnish fetal tissue for
transplantation or medical research.''
   It said the mother's decision to have an abortion should be kept
separate from her decision to allow the fetus to be used for
research and that guidelines must be drawn to avoid
commercialization of fetal tissue.
   As part of those fundamental safeguards, it said anonymity
should be maintained between the donor and recipient so there would
not be a temptation for a woman to have what was referred to in
discussions as a ``custom pregnancy'' and abortion in an effort to
provide tissue that might be implanted in a relative with
Parkinson's or some other disease.
   The committee members responded cautiously to reports that White
House adviser Gary Bauer, a staunch opponent of abortion and
distributor of the draft executive order that would ban fetal
tissue research, has suggested that Reagan might make a decision
that runs counter to the committee's recommendations, perhaps even
before they are finalized.
   ``Because it's an election year, I think it's very difficult to
comment on why people do what they do,'' said Ryan.
   Nonetheless, he said, it would ``fly in the face of the
usefulness'' of appointing the committee in the first place if a
decision was to be made before it made its recommendations.

<HEAD>Hundreds Of Thousands Look For Water, Food and Shelter in Jamaica</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Hurricane Gilbert, Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five days after Hurricane Gilbert
pounded this Caribbean island, life for hundreds of thousands of
residents has been reduced to finding clean water, something to eat
and a dry place to sleep.
   A state of emergency was in effect today in disaster areas,
where nearly half the nation's 2.3 million people live.
   At least 26 people died on this island as the storm, which
forecasters called the most intense on record, swept across the
Caribbean and Mexico's Yucatan peninsula this week before heading
for the northern Mexican coast.
   A half million Jamaicans were left homeless by Gilbert after it
hit the island's east coast, and 80 percent of the country's
500,000 homes were severely damaged or destroyed.
   Prime Minister Edward Seaga told a news conference Friday that
food stamps would soon be distributed to those most in need.
   The state-owned Jamaica Press reported that to prevent the
spread of disease, the government was trying to move people out of
refugee shelters and back to their homes, if the homes had not been
destroyed.
   On Friday, work crews covered roofless government buildings with
plastic sheets, replaced snapped utility poles and cleared streets
of debris.
   The Jamaica Broadcasting Corp. broadcast health bulletins urging
people to boil their water.
   Children bathed with soap at an open water hydrant in downtown
Kingston, and people filled plastic jugs at a burst water main.
   Many people stood in long lines to get into grocery stores
guarded by helmeted soldiers and dogs.
   Women and children balanced large water containers on their
heads or waited patiently in line to fill cans of cooking kerosene.
   Gilbert devastated what was already a weak economy with one out
of four workers unemployed. The banana and poultry industries were
destroyed and tourism, the No. 1 foreign exchange earner, faced an
uncertain future.
   One bright spot was a report by Minister of Mining and Tourism
Hugh Hart that the main aluminum and bauxite plants received little
or no damage. The minerals are among Jamaica's major exports.
   Seaga, who estimated total damage from the storm at $8 billion,
said reconstruction would require ``the largest-scale international
assistance we have ever mobilized'' _ from $300 million to $400
million worth.
   On Friday, emergency relief supplies had already arrived from
the United States, Canada, Britain, France, West Germany and other
countries, and nearly all of Jamaica's Caribbean neighbors pledged
assistance.
   The state-owned Jamaica Press said American Airlines, Air
Jamaica and other carriers agreed to airlift supplies from New York
free of charge.
   Seaga invoked emergency powers by declaring much of the island a
disaster area Thursday night. He ordered the immediate reopening of
gasoline stations and stores that sell vital supplies.
   Seaga also imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew to prevent looting.
   President Reagan sent a letter to Seaga expressing his and
America's ``deepest sympathy for the tragic loss of life'' from the
storm, said presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater in Washington.
   ``The United States will play an active role in helping Jamaica
rebuild for a bright and prosperous future,'' said the letter.
   Jamaica canceled its ``Come Back to Jamaica'' television
commercials Thursday, but travel agents in New York reported that
many people who had booked tours to the island were still planning
to go.
   Seaga was quoted by Jamaica Press as saying that damage to
``four or five'' hotels had been reported and they had closed
temporarily. Others were operating with limited services, he said.
   In Haiti, military ruler Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy issued a brief
statement Friday night expressing sympathy with Haitian victims of
Gilbert.
   Ten people drowned when their boat sank Sunday night off the
southern coast of Haiti. The government declared a state of
emergency in three southern departments.
   In the Dominican Republic, where the storm caused flooding and
widespread damage to crops, five had been reported dead.
   The Cayman Islands, which also was in the hurricane's path,
reported very minor damage, with 51 homeless out of total
population of 23,000. Phones in some areas still out of order
Friday and thousands of trees were blown down, but no significant
damage was done to buildings.

   Seabrook nuclear plant officials say
preparations for low-power testing will begin immediately following
a vote by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to clear a major
obstacle toward a long-delayed license.
   But Seabrook foes, including Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis,
declared Friday that the fight to stop the $5.6 billion reactor
from operating is far from over.
   ``The NRC _ the Not Responsible Commission _ is experiencing a
meltdown in its thinking process,'' said Dukakis, the Democratic
presidential nominee, who has played an important role in stalling
Seabrook.
   The ruling, Dukakis said in a prepared statement, ``defies logic
and brings new meaning to the word `irresponsible.'''
   The NRC on Friday voted 4-0 for a rules ``clarification'' that
will allow nuclear plants to receive low-power permits without an
emergency siren system in place to alert neighbors within 10 miles
of the reactors of an atomic emergency.
   But the commission left open the question of whether Seabrook's
owners are financially qualified to conduct the tests. Public
Service Company of New Hampshire, the main owner of Seabrook, filed
for bankruptcy reorganization last January.
   Edward Brown, president of New Hampshire Yankee, the utility's
Seabrook division, hailed the NRC action on the rule change as
``another major step forward for Seabrook.''
   He said Seabrook will require about five weeks of preparation
before the plant would be ready to begin testing at up to 5 percent
power. He estimated that the license could take another four weeks,
and that tests could begin two weeks after that.
   Asked whether Seabrook was rushing to start testing before the
November election since Dukakis is one of the plant's key
opponents, he said the timing is ``pure coincidence.''
   The lone regulatory obstacle remaining for Seabrook's low-power
license is a petition filed by plant opponents charging that the
reactor's owners are financially unfit to operate the plant.
   That question was tentatively scheduled for an NRC vote
following the siren issue, but was postponed.
   Brown predicted that a final agreement will be in place within
several weeks to cover payments being skipped by the owner of the
fourth largest Seabrook share, Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale
Electric Co.
   He described that agreement as a permanent arrangement, but
under questioning acknowledged that it would provide funding only
sometime into 1990. Asked what would happen then, Brown said, ``If
we're not in commercial operation at that point, we'll have to face
up to it at that point.''
   The idle $5.6 billion reactor is losing $50 million each month
in maintenance and finance costs.
   To critics who complain that low-power operation could be
allowed without warning sirens in place, Brown said, ``There is no
hazard to public safety from low-power testing _ absolutely none.''
   But opponents denounced the NRC vote as weakening protections to
the public.
   ``The decision again shows the Reagan-Bush administration is so
blindly committed to getting Seabrook on line that public
protection doesn't matter,'' said U.S. Rep. Edward J. Markey,
D-Mass., in a statement.
   ``Its goal is to get this plant plugged in and turned on before
Nov. 8 so that no one can turn it off later,'' Markey said.
   NRC Chairman Lando W. Zech Jr. responded that the NRC's vote
``has nothing to do with the presidential election. ... I think the
Nuclear Regulatory Commision is acting within its authority, acting
responsibly.''
   In his statement, Dukakis said the ruling comes at a time when
no adequate evacuation plan has been prepared to protect residents
near the plant, which lies just north of the Massachusetts border.
Dukakis won't submit a plan for Massachusetts communities within 10
miles of Seabrook. Plant owners have developed their own plan for
Massachusetts.
   Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon held a news
conference in Boston and vowed ``to take every action possible
including going to the federal court to stop low-power licensing.''

   Two Libyan workers stabbed three U.S.
servicemen in what U.S. officials called an ``unprovoked
altercation'' outside a bar in this Athens seaside suburb, police
and embassy officials said.
   A U.S. Embassy statement said one of the Americans was seriously
hurt in the Friday brawl but his injuries were not
life-threatening. Another was being kept for observaton and a third
had already been discharged, the statement said.
   ``They (the servicemen) were injured in an unprovoked
altercation,'' the statement said.
   ``The two attackers have been charged with aggravated assault
and battery. No charges were placed against the victims,'' it said.
   A police spokesman identified the Americans as Sgt. William
Carlisle, 24, Airman Kabil Martinez, 24, and Airman Michael Sisler,
20, all serving at Hellenikon Air Force base next to Athens
airport. Their hometowns were not available.
   ``This is not a terrorist act,'' the police spokesman said on
condition of anonymity. ``Reports we have show that it was an
early-morning brawl outside a bar. The Libyans were apparently
drunk.''
   He identified the Libyans as Gamal Liandamil, 22, a hotel
employee, and Idris Benahmed, 22, an electrician.

<HEAD>State Farm Disaster Team Readies for Hurricane Gilbert</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Insurance disaster teams armed with a
truckload of computer equipment, claim forms and blank checks left
for Texas as State Farm Insurance braced for heavy losses from
Hurricane Gilbert.
   The nation's largest home insurer sent about 60,000 blank
checks, 88 personal computers, 50 rooms of office furniture, 20
copy machines, 12 generators and enough paper folders and claim
forms to handle 100,000 claims to south Texas in anticipation of
extensive storm damage.
   ``It's a sizable operation and it's something we've done before
so we're ready,'' said Dave Hurst, spokesman for State Farm at
company headquarters in Bloomington.
   ``We have 500 people around the country on stand-by duty ready
to move in as soon as possible after the storm to handle claims.''
   An office in San Antonio will serve as the staging area for
State Farm's disaster team and 37 people were setting up earlier
this week as the hurricane ripped across the Caribbean. The storm,
however, weakened considerably after it hit the Texas-Mexico
coastline and headed north today.
   The staff at the nerve center will mushroom to 260 by the middle
of next week as State Farm agents, claim adjusters and managers
begin settling claims.
   Most insurance companies, including State Farm and Allstate,
stopped writing storm-damage coverage by Wednesday morning. And
homeowners gave up the idea of buying new flood insurance after
learning that a new policy would not take effect for five days.
   Hurst said space has been rented in seven coastal hotels for
emergency offices and phone lines already have been installed in
some locations.
   ``We've got some office furniture and phones in place but most
of its is being held back in San Antonio until after the storm
passes,'' Hurst said. ``As soon as possible after the storm, we'll
move in start processing claims.''
   Generators are sent because power often is knocked out for long
periods of time due to large storms. The company sent a handfull of
cellular phones to ensure communication lines remain open and even
25 floor fans were sent to keep computer equipment ventilated.
   Losses were expected to be heavy in Texas, where State Farm is
the largest single insurer of homes, Hurst said. In the Brownsville
area, the most heavily hit, State Farm insures about 8 percent of
all homes.
   ``We think this storm will not be as bad Hurricane Alicia in
1983 which hit Houston and Galveston,'' Hurst said. ``In that
storm, we paid $150 million in claims. It was the worst storm we
ever had. But we'll still have quite a few claims this time.''

<HEAD>Aquino: U.S., Soviets Must Decide on Gorbachev Proposal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino said today
it was up to the United States and the Soviet Union to decide
whether to maintain or pull out their bases in Southeast Asia.
   Mrs. Aquino was responding to an offer Friday by Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev to abandon a strategic naval base in Vietnam
if the United States would abandon its bases in the Philippines.
   ``That is for the two superpowers to discuss and to talk
about,'' Mrs. Aquino told reporters at the presidential palace.
   Gorbachev made the offer in a speech in which he outlined a
seven-point plan for defusing tension in Asia. His call came
against a backdrop of growing opposition to the U.S. bases in the
Philippines.
   Earlier today, Sen. Leticia Shahani belittled Gorbachev's
pullout offer, saying the Soviet and U.S. military facilities were
not ``comparable.''
   Ms. Shahani, chairwoman of the Senate's Foreign Relations
Committee, said the U.S.-run Clark Air Base and the Subic Bay Naval
Base were ``far bigger complexes'' than the Kremlin's base at Cam
Ranh Bay, Vietnam.
   Ramon Mitra, speaker of the House of Representatives said: ``It
is us (Filipinos) who will chart our own foreign policy.'' But his
deputy Antonio Cuenco said Gorbachev's offer was a ``sound
proposal.''
   Mrs. Aquino said Friday said she hoped the Philippines and the
United States could resolve their differences in talks over the
U.S. bases despite a deadlock over compensation and other issues.
   She said Filipino Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus, who is in
the United States, and Secretary of State George Shultz were trying
to narrow differences ``so I'm hoping they will.''
   On Thursday, Shultz said in Washington that the United States
wanted to keep Clark, Subic and four other installations in the
Philippines but that Manila's demands for more money were too high.
   ``There are alternatives which we are having now to examine,''
Shultz said shortly after meeting with Manglapus, chief of the
Philippine panel in the stalled bases talks that began in April.
   U.S. officials say Washington is considering moving the bases to
Guam or other sites.
   The United States pays about $180 million a year for use of the
six bases.
   Manglapus has said the Americans have offered about $502 million
in compensation but added the $1.2 billion annual Phillipine demand
is ``reasonable.''
   Cam Ranh Bay is the Soviets' major naval deployment base abroad,
while Clark and Subic are the United States's largest foreign bases.
   The United States says its bases are essential to prevent Soviet
military expansion in the Far East.
   About 40,000 troops, military dependents and Defense Department
civilians are stationed at the six bases in the Philippines, which
employ about 42,000 Filipinos. Annual salaries to Filipino
civilians total more than $83 million, the second largest payroll
after the Philippine government.

   Worried Soviet space officials are considering
changes in training for their cosmonauts after a capsule stranded
in orbit last week, the director of the program said.
   ``We altogether, including the Mission Control Center, the
cosmonauts and engineers, were a bit complacent about our life and
maybe our preparedness got a bit lower _ our preparedness for
functions in unexpected situations that can always emerge in any
flight,'' Vladimir A. Shatalov told reporters Friday.
   But Shatalov told reporters that ``nothing teaches us more than
the difficulties we encounter in life.''
   Cosmonauts Abdul Ahad Mohmand of Afghanistan and veteran Soviet
spaceman Vladimir Lyakhov were stranded in orbit for 26 tense hours
on Sept. 6 because of equipment and crew problems on their Soyuz
TM-5 capsule. After two unsuccessful attempts to reenter the
atmosphere, the capsule landed safely in Soviet Central Asia as
food and oxygen ran dangerously low.
   The two cosmonauts, Shatalov and other space scientists faced a
Moscow news conference Friday to assess the problems of the flight.
   ``I think that after this flight all the experts in space
technology, the Mission Control Center and training center will
make many useful conclusions that will be realized in changes in
the design, logic of management, documentation and equipment of the
center, in the organizational structure and probably in the methods
of cosmonauts' training,'' said Shatalov.
   Before the capsule was stranded in space, it docked with the Mir
orbiting space station, where it left off a doctor who is to
monitor the health of two cosmonauts conducting experiments there
since December.
   After the capsule undocked from the Mir and was preparing to
return to Earth, a sensor in the Soyuz's guidance system failed to
fire an engine that slows down the capsule so it can safely enter
the atmosphere. On a second attempt, the braking engine fired under
automatic control, but shut itself down.
   Lyakhov admitted to reporters last week that he had made
mistakes, such as improperly restarting the engine after the second
failed attempt. But he did not refer to the mistake at Friday's
briefing.
   Alexander Dunayev, chief of the space agency Glavkosmos, said
mission control also erred when it did not make a necessary
adjustment to control the speed of the descent. The problem was
diagnosed and resolved, he said, but ``you can see we made a
certain mistake in control and those mistakes should be
liquidated.''
   Shatalov said Friday that the stranded capsule could have made
an emergency landing at various sites in the Soviet Union and in
the United States, Canada and France. But he said the return to
Earth was postponed to give mission control and the cosmonauts time
to set up the landing at the planned Soviet site, where ground
crews were waiting to assist the cosmonauts after touchdown.
   Dunayev said the Soviets hope to launch an unmanned space
shuttle this year but want to be completely certain of a successful
mission before a launch is scheduled.

<TEXT>
   This partially evacuated city,
spared the worst of Hurricane Gilbert, became a windsurfers'
paradise as crowds turned out to ride the blustery skirts of the
giant storm.
   Boarded-up buildings and empty streets made much of Corpus
Christi seem abandoned, but Ocean Drive was jammed with traffic jam
Friday as residents and tourists flocked to the seawall after word
that Gilbert would hit farther to the south than expected.
   Scores of cars cruised up and down the windy beachfront road, as
bicyclists, joggers and windsurfers were joined by crowds of
residents complaining of cabin fever in their boarded-up homes.
   ``This is definitely the advanced class,'' said Nancy Clark, a
legal investigator who took her sailboard into 35-mph winds here
after fleeing Port Isabel.
   Her biggest danger was the parking lot beside the beach.
   ``I was so excited when I got here and saw the waves that I
slipped down on the pavement,'' she said, rolling up her wetsuit to
display a small gash on her shin. ``This is what we wait all year
for.''
   ``This definitely rates a `10'. But it's also a good day for
conservative, positive sailing,'' said Corpus Christi architect
Robert Jones, one of about a half-dozen windsurfers who rode high
tides at 4 feet above normal levels.
   ``I was sitting in the house with the windows boarded up,
getting kind of bored,'' said Jones. ``I decided I'd just get out
here and see what the winds were like.''
   Many of the residents and tourists who decided to stay had heard
repeated warnings that Gilbert would likely turn toward the north,
striking land near Brownsville and bashing Corpus Christi with
heavy wind and rain.
   But when the hurricane stayed on its course toward Mexico, the
seawall swelled with confident crowds, despite warnings of flash
floods.
   ``Most people probably wouldn't expect to see this many people
down here in a hurricane, but once you've lived in Corpus Christi
for a while, you come to expect the unusual out of the residents,''
said Russ Roland, who was enjoying his daily bicycle ride along the
seawall.
   For a lot of the natives here it's seen as kind of a sign of
bravado, Roland said.
   ``We don't have this many people out here on an average day
during the summer,'' he said.
   Families gathered along the seawall as the waves lapped at the
concrete steps, and children danced along the edge of the churning
water, mugging for cameras.
   Many, including Doug Reiter, said they just grew tired of
sitting inside a house darkened by plywood-covered windows.
   ``I think everybody is just bored, and this is kind of a release
from being cooped up,'' he said. ``You can only take that sort of
thing so long before you start getting stir crazy.''

<DATELINE>WEST ORANGE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hard-nosed principal Joe Clark, saying
``we've had enough of liberals,'' declared he's ready to expand his
tough talk beyond the halls of Eastside High School and run for
public office.
   Clark told several reporters and about 50 supporters Friday
night that he's running for Essex County Freeholder as a Republican
because he wants to inject his conservative philosophy into
politics.
   Clark gained national attention this past year as a
disciplinarian known for roaming the halls of his Paterson school
with a baseball bat and bullhorn. Some have criticized his tactics
as more flash than substance and condemned him for intimidating
students.
   Others ranging from newspaper editorial writers to the Reagan
administration credit Clark as an example of a tough black urban
educator who brought law and order to a rowdy, inner-city school.
   ``Don't look at the color of my skin,'' Clark said Friday.
``Look at me because of the contents of my ability.''
   Clark, who said he wouldn't give up his job as principal if he
won the election, was selected for the November ticket by a group
of county Republicans, said John P. Renna, chairman of the Essex
County Republican Party.
   ``We selected him because he has an excellent background,''
Renna said. ``He has an aggressive personality. He's nationally
known.''
   For his part, Clark said he was running because ``we've had
enough of liberals.''
   The principal will face Democratic nominee Leroy J. Jones Jr., a
finance manager for AT&T. ``I think everybody's entitled to the
political arena,'' Jones commented. ``I look forward to the
challenge.''

   The late A.L. Donahue, a native Texan who later
lived in Arizona, was 18 in September 1900 when a hurricane struck
Galveston Island just before midnight, killing 6,000 people. It was
the worst natural disaster in U.S. history. Here's his account of
that storm, as written, from his journal of some years later:
   It was on a Saturday and the wind was blowing from the south,
coming in from the Gulf and gradually increasing its velocity as
the day wore on.
   I and one or two of my brothers were cutting red-top cane by
hand and standing it in large round shocks. ...
   The clouds come up about the middle of the morning and got
thicker as the hours passed, and about 3:30 in the afternoon I
could head a deep low sound of thunder in the southeast and as it
slowly come close and closer, the very ground that I stood on would
vibrate for long periods. And the wind was increasing, and the
clouds looked nearly as black as bellows of coal smoke and (were)
down close to the tree tops.
   All birds stopped their singing and no cricket or frog made any
sound, just the wind and the continued sound of heavy thunder is
all that you could hear.
   There is a helpless feeling that accompanies any real storm
cloud for all of nature's life of low or high cast. ... (one has)
no idea just how unimportant and small and helpless a storm can
make anyone feel, and this storm on that September day is the
darkest of my memory.
   The waves come over the (50-foot) seawalls ... (and) all was
confusion. You could hear screams for help and the prayers and
cries of the drowning above the sound of the thunders and rolling
billows of the deep as they come in and over the entire town.
   In one of the higher buildings ... the third floor held the
central telephone switchboard, and the girls on duty stayed until
the water come through the windows and then all soon was washed out
into the tempest of surging water.
   Timbers, trees, logs, houses, people, horses, cattle, hogs, dogs
and chickens, turkeys and other animals and fowls was all mixed in
those waves as they come in and swept back out to sea, carrying in
their undercurrent everything that was caught as they boiled up
over and down and under, then back to repeat the same action over
and over for 12 to 14 hours.
   There was a Society Ball held on the third floor of a brick
building. They danced and sang and prayed, cried and screamed but
the music continued until the waves come through the windows and
all (were) taken.
   (When daylight finally came, ``a death-shrouded dawn,'' he was
in the water.)
   There was a young woman bobbed up right near holding to a heavy
timber with one hand and under the other arm she held a baby or a
small child, and soon as she could she cried for help. I was near
on a timber or timbers that seemed to be the wood ceiling of a
large room. I could almost reach out and catch them, but ... as I
was about to get a good hold, the bottom fell out of where we was
and everything went down and down. But I still stayed with my
timbers and when I come to the surface again and got the salt water
out of my face and eyes, I looked in every direction, and by the
flashes of lightning I saw my young lady again, but she was not
close and she did not have that child. ... Very soon there was a
mountain of water between she was and me ... and I never seen her
any more to know it.

rattlesnakes and lizards for sale to reptile gardens.
   He was also known for making archaeological finds, and artifacts
from his collection are to be found in the Smithsonian Institution

<TEXT>
   For six couples, the memories of a
Jamaican vacation will include flying debris, quivering buildings,
water sloshing in toilet bowls and ocean foam splashing at their
hotel windows.
   The couples from Fernandina Beach, whose four-day holiday began
as a lark, were among thousands of travelers trapped on the island
by Hurricane Gilbert, one of the century's most violent storms.
   ``You couldn't see the ground from our room three stories
above,'' Jan Nabors, one of the group, recalled Thursday. ``You
couldn't see three or four feet in front of you on the balcony.''
   In Jamaica, where winds reached 175 mph, an estimated 500,000
people were left homeless and at least 26 were reported dead from
Gilbert, which passed directly over the island Monday.
   The Fernandina Beach couples attempted to leave Jamaica on
Sunday from Montego Bay, but high winds had already canceled the
flights.
   The tourists were told they would be evacuated from Sandal's
Royal Caribbean Hotel to a more secure structure. The next day, the
group was taken by bus to join about 1,500 tourists taking refuge
at the Wyndham Hotel, a seven-story structure about 300 feet from
the ocean.
   ``The air was white'' with foam blown from the sea, tourist John
Burbank said.
   ``On the ocean side, windows were being blown out,'' said Mrs.
Nabors' husband, Donald.
   Some of the group began to move out into the hotel hallways to
hide from flying glass if their windows burst, they said.
   At one point the windows in another room burst, the door was
blown off the hinges and the hallway walls began to lean inward
from the force of the wind, Nabors said.
   ``We saw the wall buckling in and when it started doing that, we
moved on down to the end of the hallway. We were getting away from
the ocean side of the hotel and going to the inland side.
   ``Once it blew out the windows, you could feel the whole
corridor vibrating,'' he said.
   Under the assault of the winds, the entire hotel shook, Mrs.
Nabors said.
   ``The water was sloshing out of the toilets,'' she said.
``That's shaking.''
   The couples arrived at Jacksonville International Airport on
Thursday.
   ``We're just glad to be alive,'' Nabors said as he walked off
the plane. ``It was a hell of a storm.''

   Federal officials have overcome major legal
obstacles in their case against Ferdinand Marcos and it is now
likely they will ask a federal grand jury to indict the former
Philippine president for fraud, the Los Angeles Times reported
today.
   However, the indictment is expected to deal only with
accusations of wrongdoing after Marcos left office in February
1986, the newspaper said.
   The case was narrowed to overcome doubts about whether U.S. law
could apply to the deposed president's alleged efforts to
misappropriate billions of dollars in Philippine taxpayers' funds,
according to anonymous sources cited by the newspaper.
   The indictment, anticipated for months, has been delayed by a
number of circumstances.

expressed reservations at one point about the quality of the case
when draft charges were brought before him.
   The investigation is now focusing on allegations that Marcos and
his wife, Imelda, conspired with Saudi Arabian financier Adnan
Khashoggi and others to violate U.S. district court injunctions.
They allegedly secretly transferred ownership of hundreds of
millions of dollars in stolen art and Manhattan real estate bought
with Philippine government funds.
   Court records in related civil lawsuits allege that Marcos took
control of the funds while he was still in power but used elaborate
schemes involving front companies and agents to hide his ownership
and liquidate properties after he went into exile in Hawaii.
   The inter-agency Police Review Group, which became more
prominent in the wake of the diplomatically embarrassing attempt to
prosecute Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega on federal drug
charges in Florida, helped settle problems with the legal case
early in the week, the Times said.
   U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani in New York, along with his
staff, outlined details of proposed criminal charges against Marcos
at a White House meeting of the review group Tuesday, The Times
said. President Reagan did not attend.
   Intelligence advisers are expected next week to offer their
opinions on how the case could affect foreign relations.
   In a statement issued from the Philippine embassy in Washington,
D.C., Severina Rivera, general counsel for his government's
Presidential Commission on Good Government, said:
   ``There has been considerable skepticism in Manila about
President Reagan's willingness to approve the indictment of Mr.
Marcos. ... If he approves it, Filipinos everywhere will applaud
Mr. Reagan and the American system of justice that applies the full
force of the law to corrupt dictators who violate U.S. laws.''
   However, some concern has been expressed that Marcos may flee to
Mexico or another country because the indictment is imminent, a
source told The Times.

   Mayor Carl Peve and two members of the
village board have quit in a pig-headed dispute over pork
sandwiches and control of a town festival.
   A third village board member is threatening to resign after a
board meeting this week failed to resolve questions about who
should monitor the annual Lafayette Reunion Days.
   ``I'm done. I'm through being called names and having people
wave their fists in my face,'' said Mayor Peve.
   The dispute concerns an ordinance empowering the village board
to oversee the activities of a committee that organizes summer
festivals.
   Gene Scott, president of this year's organizing group, the
Reunion Committee, said the three-day festival in August was a
success and drew more than 1,500 visitors to the town of 277.
   But Peve insists the committee needs to be monitored, and some
of the loudest squealing concerned the mayor's allegation that the
committee slaughtered several hogs and sold pork sandwiches without
having the meat properly inspected.
   Dennis Lovins of the Illinois Department of Agriculture said
meat products must be inspected before being sold. Scott, who noted
communities commonly slaughter hogs for fairs, said his only
mistake was in not asking people to make a donation for the
sandwiches instead of buying them.
   ``This town is supposed to be a community of little helpers, but
some members of the board got pigheaded and decided to play God and
butt into our business,'' Scott said.

<HEAD>Another Wet Weekend Expected In Yellowstone</HEAD>

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Firefighters looked
forward to another wet and cool weekend in Yellowstone National
Park, but elsewhere across the West forest fires continued to rage
under the whip of shifting winds.
   The fires that have affected half of the park's 2.2 million
acres stayed within containment lines although flames shot through
the park on Friday, with temperatures increasing to the mid-60s and
steady winds approaching 35 mph, authorities said.
   Today's forecast called for a chance of light snowshowers this
afternoon and temperatures in the 50s. Heavy winds also were
expected, but park spokeswoman Sonya Capek said the high humidity
and cool temperatures would keep the fires down.
   Firefighters in Glacier National Park in Montana were not as
lucky Friday. About 200 firefighters were forced to retreat from a
blaze after winds gusting to 40 mph pushed a wall of fire past
containment lines.
   ``It was just an incredible show,'' fire information officer Kim
Berns said of the 300-feet high flames.
   Shifting winds pushed the 34,500-acre fire up a drainage along
the northeast flank where crews were reconstructing lines that blew
out Thursday, Berns said.
   In Idaho, officials were throwing all available manpower and
equipment at a wilderness fire in the north-central Gospel Hump
Wilderness as wildfires continued to burn in most of the state's
national forests.
   ``I don't know if we're over the hump as far as the fire season
goes, but we've been saying we're guardedly optimistic,'' said
Sandi Sacher, an information officer at the Boise Interagency Fire
Center.
   Fires that have consumed more than 190,000 acres remained out of
control and outside wilderness boundaries in the Nez Perce,
Challis, Panhandle and Salmon national forests, she said.
   Firefighters in Washington state, meanwhile, contained three
large fires that have charred more than 70,000 acres.
   In Yellowstone, 30 Canadian firefighters arrived Friday to help
battle the flames burning within nearly 1.2 million acres of the
2.2 million-acre park. The ``helitak'' group was the first Canadian
crew to arrive on scene since the U.S. Forest Service accepted that
country's offer to help.
   The experienced firefighters are a first-attack group, which
fights flames from a helicopter, Capek said.
   This past week, firefighters took advantage of the wet cold
weather to strengthen existing lines around fires and extend the
lines. By Friday, 50 percent of the 335,500-acre North Fork fire,
the most troublesome of the blazes in the park, had been contained.
   Officials believe the rain and snow that fell in the park had
dampened fuels sufficiently so that only seven days of continued
dry weather would bring back the tinder-dry conditions that allowed
fires to grow by thousands of acres daily, said Denny Bungarz,
North Fork fire incident commander. Officials predicted they would
contain that blaze by mid-October.
   Military personnel were stationed on either side of U.S. Highway
191, the fire's western edge, to keep it from jumping the road.
   ``If you put two hot shot crews in competition with each other,
it's a situation of two plus two equals five,'' Bungarz said. ``I
think the Army and the Marines will react the same way.''
   About 700 Marines from Camp Pendleton in California arrived
Friday, bringing the military force in the park up to 4,100.
   Fire information officer Marvin Crocker said the Marines
probably would be out on the fire lines today.
   In Oakridge, Ore., a $5,000 reward was offered for information
leading to the arrest and conviction of the person responsible for
starting a forest fire burning in the Willamette National Forest.
   A fire patrol plane crew and witnesses have given fire
investigators solid leads about vehicles seen in the area when the
blaze was only about an acre in size, forest officials said.
   The fire had grown to 7,300 acres Friday, but Forest Service
officials predicted it would be contained by next week and
controlled by the end of the month.

<HEAD>Government Presents Kurds Who Support Baghdad, Condemn Rebels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN RICE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSUL, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq, trying to counter charges it used
poison gas against its Kurdish minority, brought foreign
correspondents to the heart of Kurdistan and paraded Kurds who
denounced the rebels and praised Iraq.
   The local Kurds denied the government used poison gas against
them, and scorned the rebels who fled to Turkey last month.
   ``If one of them comes, I would drink his blood like water. They
are the traitors of our country,'' Naima Khader Hussein told
reporters Friday in Sulaymaniyah.
   She said her husband died fighting the rebels in 1985. Around
her were dozens of other relatives of Kurds killed by insurgents,
many holding pictures of their loved ones.
   The Iraqi government, infuriated by mounting Western charges
that it used poison gas to crush Kurdish insurgents, arranged the
one-day trip for journalists to show the accusations were baseless.
   Journalists from the around the world were flown by jetliner
Friday from Baghdad to the oil center of Kirkuk. There they boarded
Soviet MI-8 helicopters and flew to Sulaymaniyah, then on to Mosul
by dusk. There was also a side trip by bus to meet Kurdish refugees
who had accepted an amnesty program in Arbat, near Sulaymaniyah.
   Government officials in green uniforms hovered over each
interview and helped translate some Kurdish to Arabic and then to
English. They often cut off talks after a few minutes to rush
reporters on to the next engagement.
   At a new cinder block village, a group of Kurds greeted the
journalists, chanting: ``With blood and soul we sacrifice ourselves
for you Saddam,'' referring to President Saddam Hussein.
   Officials said the group came ``from dirty villages,'' but
several of them said they had moved from the city of Sulaymaniyeh
to take advantage of free houses.
   The towns themselves were busy, full of Kurdish men in sashed,
baggy trousers and distinctive head scarves.
   But the view during the helicopter flight from Sulaymaniyah
appeared to confirm reports that the government is relocating many
Kurds from remote villages into new concrete housing complexes and
destroying old settlements.
   Reporters saw several new housing complexes laid out in
geometric order near highways on the Kurdish plain.
   There were few if any villages of the traditional style visible
from the air, and dozens appeared demolished. A few were scorched
with fire.
   On Thursday, Defense Minister Adnan Khairallah said villagers
were being relocated away from the border for security reasons and
also to provide them with improved services.
   None of the Kurds brought forward by the government accused
Iraqi officials of knocking down villages.
   ``The rebels used to burn the villages and take the families
away,'' said Majid Karim Sharif in Arbat.
   Camp officials said more than 4,200 Kurds had returned to the
Arbat center, about 56 miles from the border with Iran, to take
advantage of the amnesty announced by the Iraqi government last
week.
   The government has said previously that more than 11,500 Kurds
have sought amnesty.
   In a separate development, a spokesman for the Kurdish rebels
claimed that 2,400 Kurdish civilians trapped in a mountain ravine
were killed in a poison gas attack Aug. 30 by Iraqi warplanes.
   Word of the alleged slaughter was delayed because it took the
handful of Kurds who survived the attack 10 days to reach southern
Turkey and contact rebel officials, the spokesman for the Kurdistan
Democratic Party reported in a telephone interview with The
Associated Press in Cyprus.
   The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
victims were fleeing an Iraqi military offensive by trekking to
Turkey.
   He claimed the casualties raised the number of Kurds killed by
Iraqi chemical weapons since early August to around 4,300.
   The official also said that Kurdistan Democratic Party
guerrillas, battling an estimated 60,000 Iraqi troops pushing into
rebel-held mountains in northern Iraq, killed 140 in a major clash
several days ago.

<HEAD>Gilbert's Strength Diminishes; Elswhere, Fair Skies the Rule</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Hurricane Gilbert was downgraded to a tropical storm this
morning as its sustained winds decreased to 65 mph, and the storm
was expected to further weaken as it continued on a west-northwest
course along the Texas-Mexico border.
   Elsewhere, fair weather conditions were the rule, except for
some rain in parts of Washington state and Montana, the northern
Rockies into the Plains, and the Great Lakes through the upper Ohio
Valley into the Tennessee Valley.
   Because of the Gilbert, tides of seven to 11 feet above normal
were reported from Brownsville to Port O'Conner in Texas and four
to six feet above normal elsewhere along the Texas coast.
   A tornado watch continued in parts of south Texas and adjacent
coastal waters this morning, and a flash flood watch remained in
effect for much of south Texas.
   More than 4{ inches of rain fell in Brownsville in 24 hours
ended early this morning.
   Showers and thunderstorms brought locally heavy rain to parts of
Alabama Friday, and numerous roads were under water. Flash flood
watches or warnings were in effect for much of the state.
   Today's national weather forecast called for thunderstorms due
to Gilbert in south-central and southwest Texas; and showers and
thunderstorms from the Gulf Coast states into the Tennessee and
lower Mississippi valleys, from the Carolinas to southern New
England, from the upper Ohio Valley to New York state, and from the
Pacific Northwest to Montana.
   High temperatures were expected in the 70s and 80s across much
of the nation.
   Highs were likely to approach 90 degrees in the central Plains,
and the middle Mississippi and lower Ohio valleys; 90 to 95 in
Florida and parts of the Gulf Coast states; 90s to about 100
degrees in the desert Southwest; 60s in the north Atlantic Coast
states and the Pacific; and 50s and 60s in Montana and Idaho.
   The nation's temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 33 degrees
at McCall, Idaho, to 84 at Homestead, Fla., Phoenix and the Naval
Air Station at Corpus Christi, Texas.

<HEAD>Valerie Harper Wins Court Battle Over Firing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Valerie Harper was awarded $1.85
million and a share of the profits from the show ``Valerie'' by a
jury that found the Lorimar production company acted in bad faith
in firing her.
   The jury foreman said the message of Friday's verdict was, ``You
just have to treat people fairly.''
   Miss Harper said she felt ``vindicated, gratified, thrilled''
with the verdict, which her lawyer said could earn the actress up
to $15 million.
   ``The truth did prevail,'' she told reporters. ``We won
financially. We won morally. I don't see any loss of any kind.''
   The Superior Court jury spent nearly a month hearing evidence
and took 4{ days to reach a complex verdict that required them to
answer more than 30 questions.
   Lorimar Telepictures Corp., which produces the NBC series,
originally sued Miss Harper, claiming she breached her contract by
quitting the show. A countersuit by the actress and her husband
contended she was wrongfully fired in August 1987. NBC and
individual producers were dropped from that suit during trial.
   The jury found that Miss Harper, her husband, Tony Cacciotti,
and their company, AV Productions, had lived up to their contracts
with Lorimar.
   But they said Lorimar acted ``in bad faith, without a reasonable
basis or probable cause'' by firing the actress.
   Jurors believed that Lorimar witnesses lied when they said Miss
Harper was out to ``submarine the show,'' said the jury foreman,
postal worker Archie McDaniels.
   The firm should not have held a crucial meeting in Miss Harper's
absence before firing her, he said.
   ``The television business is just like any other business,''
McDaniels said. ``You have good and bad. This verdict doesn't
condemn the TV industry. You just have to treat people fairly.''
   The panel awarded the $1.85 million in general damages for lost
wages, but declined to award punitive damages to Miss Harper and
her husband, who was a supervising producer on the NBC series.
   Miss Harper also was granted a 12{ percent share of adjusted
gross profits for the 1987-88 season, including fees for
syndication of the show. Her contract would have run through 1991.
   Her attorney, Barry Langberg, said the share of the gross
profits could bring the actress $10 million to $15 million in the
long run.
   Lorimar's attorney, Donald Engel, expressed relief that punitive
damages were not awarded.
   ``It could have been worse,'' he said, adding that an appeal was
unlikely because ``the verdict is so small.''
   But Lorimar spokeswoman Barbara Brogliatti disagreed. ``We're
disappointed in the verdict,'' she said. ``And our attorney has
advised us there are grounds for an appeal and we are considering
it.''
   Some of the jurors lined up in the hallway after delivering
their verdict to get Miss Harper's autograph.
   At the trial, the company claimed that Miss Harper was
emotionally unstable and menopausal, a position she denounced
Friday as ``sexist.''
   Sandy Duncan replaced Miss Harper on the show, which was
retitled ``The Hogan Family.

   Ramon Simpas Subejano, a Philippine native who
became one of the United States' most decorated war veterans, died
at the Veteran's Administration Hospital in Boston. He was 83.
   He had been hospitalized for a brief illness before his death
Friday.
   Subejano left the Philippines for the United States in 1927,
when he stowed away aboard a freighter. He traversed the world as a
seaman before buying a pool hall in Brooklyn with $32,000 he won
one night in a casino.
   But he lost all his money in the Great Depression and went to
work as a busboy. Subejano was drafted in the Army in 1942 and
became one of the most effective soldiers in Europe, killing more
than 400 German soldiers from Normandy to the Rhineland.
   He was wounded four times and came home disabled but covered
with medals, including a Silver Star and decorations from the
French, Dutch and Belgian governments.
   He was awarded the Silver Star for the single-handed capture of
a Nazi-held factory near Dillingen, Germany. According to his
service record, Subejano crept into the ravaged factory against
heavy machine gun fire and grenade explosions, killing five
Germans, wounding six and forcing the surrender of 37 others.
   Subejano, a lifelong bachelor who was described as polite and
easygoing, made the news last year when he was involved in a slight
altercation with his landlord over a rent increase.
   The landlord filed a criminal complaint against 5-foot-2
Subejano, claiming that he had threatened him even though the
landlord stood 6-foot-2 and weighed 250 pounds.
   At the time of the incident, a neighbor said Subejano was
``still out every day in a beautifully pressed white shirt, little
suit with suspenders and a spit-shine polish on his shoes. I don't
know what he did in the war but he's still a tough little guy.''

   Several hundred thousand anti-government
protesters took to the streets of the capital today to demand
democracy, and troops opened fire on a crowd surrounding government
buildings, wounding at least three.
   Most of the protesters today marched peacefully in lines through
the streets of the capital, some carrying placards that read: ``If
we don't get it, we will hit out.''
   But a violent scene developed around the Trade Ministry
building, where troops opened fire to disperse an angry crowd. At
least three people were wounded.
   The sound of gunfire attracted a much larger crowd, and many
threatened to burn down the building. Buddhist monks intervened
before the threats could be carried out.
   Soon after, a group of students clambered over adjacent rooftops
to break into the Ministry building. It was not immediately clear
whether the students remained in the building or had been persuaded
to leave.
   Protesters also surrounded two other nearby government
buildings, City Hall and the Central Bank. Shooting was heard in
the area but it could not immediately be determined who was
involved.
   Troops had not been reported to fire on anti-government
protesters since mid-August.
   About 100 soldiers were posted at both the Central Bank and City
Hall but only a few were at the Trade Ministry.
   Today's protests indicated that the population of Rangoon, the
nation's capital, was unsatisfied with yet another concession by
the government.
   State radio announced Friday that all military personnel and
civil servants must resign from the ruling Burma Socialist Program
Party and refrain from membership in all future political parties.
   The decision, the radio said, was made at the recommendation of
a recently formed election commission which is to supervise
multi-party elections in about three months. The opposition has
rejected this move, saying an interim government must be formed
before elections take place.
   About two-thirds of the 2.5 million members of the ruling party
come from military and civil service ranks.
   Some opposition leaders, who are believed to be negotiating with
President Maung Maung's government, have been attempting to stop
mob violence from escalating.
   On Friday, prominent dissident Aung Gyi defused a potentially
bloody confrontation between soldiers and more than 100,000
demonstrators moving on the Ministry of Defense armed with spears,
swords and knives.
   Aung Gyi, a former brigadier general, asked the crowd to ``fight
without bloodshed.''
   ``We cannot blame these soldiers for the faults of some of their
commanders,'' he told the crowd. ``Soldiers are born of the people.
They are the people's army.''
   One Burmese intellectual who watched the confrontation said of
the protesters: ``They don't seem to be afraid of the guns. They
are angry and frustrated.''
   Interviews with a number of Burmese government employees today
also indicated that a government warning that all civil servants
return to work by Sept. 26 or face official action would go
unheeded.
   Virtually all government employees, including some police and
military personnel, have been on strike since Aug. 8, causing an
almost total administrative breakdown.
   Massive protests began after strongman Ne Win, who seized power
in 1962, resigned last July. His replacement, hardliner Sein Lwin,
attempted to restore order by ordering the military to fire at the
swelling number of protestors but resigned 17 days later.
   On Aug. 19, the relatively moderate Maung Maung became Burma's
first civilian leader in a quarter century, but he has also been
unable to stop the nationwide uprising.

   About 100 radical students took to the
city's streets today in an anti-Olympic protest on the Games'
opening day, and police arrested about a dozen of them, witnesses
said.
   The students marched from a shopping center toward Myongdong
Cathedral, shouting ``Oppose single-host Olympics!'' and ``Down
with military dictatorship!'' witnesses said.
   Soon after the march began, about 100 plainclothes police
charged the demonstration and arrested about a dozen protesters,
the witnesses said.
   No tear gas was fired and no injuries reported, they said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   It was the first known anti-Olympic street demonstration in
Seoul in recent weeks. Most student protests have been carried out
on university campuses.
   Radical students, who form a small minority in South Korea, are
demanding that the Olympics be shared with North Korea to help
unify the Korean peninsula, which was divided at the end of World
War II in 1945.
   North Korea boycotted the Olympics after its demand to co-host
the Games was turned down by the International Olympic Committee.

<TEXT>
   The biggest athletic show on earth
opened today with a record number of nearly 10,000 Olympic athletes
from 160 countries marching under a massive security blanket and
the jealous glare of communist North Korea.
   A colorful, 3{-hour spectacle mixing ancient Korean rituals with
space-age technology kicked off 16 days of athletic competition at
the Seoul Summer Games. The Games will provide a showcase for South
Korea and produce the first all-out East-West gold rush since the
1976 Montreal Games.
   ``I'm glad the sky is so high and so blue,'' Yuk Hee-Jin, a
17-year-old Korean high school student, said on entering the
stadium. ``I believe God is blessing my country for its years of
hard work and preparations for the Olympic Games.''
   After mutual boycotts of the 1980 Moscow and 1984 Los Angeles
Games, Soviet bloc and Western athletes strode into Seoul's
sun-washed Olympic Stadium in closed ranks to the tumultuous roar
of a sellout crowd of 70,000.
   On the streets of downtown Seoul meanwhile, police arrested
about a dozen radical students today for mounting an anti-Olympic
protest, witnesses said. But no tear gas was fired to quell the
protest and no injuries were reported.
   At least a billion others watched the Olympics via a 115-nation,
worldwide television hookup. NBC alone paid $300 million for
television rights to the Games, which cost the South Korean hosts
$3.1 billion for stadiums, arenas and various support facilities,
all of which were in place well before the start of the Games.
   By decree of the International Olympic Committee, North Korean
television was blacked out. The communist nation had demanded to
co-host the Games, but Olympic officials said only one nation can
do so.
   Superlatives of the Seoul Games included: the most athletes
(9,633), the most countries (20 more than at Los Angeles), the most
gold medals (237) and the most venues (34 for 23 official sports
and three demonstration sports).
   Communist North Korea sparked a mini-boycott that failed to sway
its biggest political allies, including the Soviet Union and China.
   Of the countries following North Korea's boycott, only Cuba
ranked as a sports power, while Ethiopia had hopes in the marathon.
Both also boycotted the Los Angeles Games.
   The other no-shows _ Albania, the Seychelles, Madagascar and
Nicaragua _ are not regarded as major sports nations.
   On the eve of the opening ceremonies, North Korea again
displayed its wrath, saying in an official Communist Party
statement that South Korean President Roh Tae-woo's call for a
``successful opening of the Olympics ... will help intensify the
fascist rule, increase the danger of war and mean tolerating the
schemes to perpetuate the division of the nation.''
   Similar criticism of the Games has come from student radicals in
the south, hundreds of whom staged scattered anti-Olympic,
anti-government, and anti-U.S. demonstrations in Seoul as the
Olympic torch arrived in the capital Friday. But none of the
demonstrations came near the heavily guarded Olympic facilities or
the torch procession. They also failed to arouse popular support.
   In one protest at the Kookmin University, about 300 students
burned an effigy of President Reagan as well as a U.S. flag.
   But the anti-Americanism of the radical students found no echo
in the Olympic stadium, where the crowd gave one of its loudest
accolades to the U.S. team.
   For South Korea, the Games offered a worldwide showcase for its
emergence from a developing country to an Asian industrial power
whose exports include computers, automobiles and super tankers.
   To guard against internal or external threats to the Games,
South Korea has marshalled a 120,000-man security force and placed
its 650,000-member armed forces on heightened alert. Although not
directly involved in Olympic security, the 40,000-member U.S.
ground forces were placed on ``increased alert'' and a U.S. Navy
carrier task force patrolled off the coast.
   South Korea has stressed the Games' theme of reconciliation and
of ``Harmony and Progress'' _ a theme symbolized in the omnipresent
South Korean flag at the center of which is a sunlike disc
combining the opposing forces: the red Yin and the blue Yang.
   The strains of Beethoven's Choral Symphony, lauding the
brotherhood of man, resounded through the stadium as the procession
of Olympic athletes got underway.
   From his box which appeared to be enclosed in bullet-proof
glass, Roh rose to declare the Games of the 24th Olympiad
officially open.
   Iran, in line with its fundamental Islamic beliefs, was the only
country in the procession to have a Korean man, not a woman, carry
the signboard bearing its name.
   The first competitions scheduled for after the ceremony today
were women's platform diving, soccer, men's volleyball, men's
basketball, boxing and taekwondo, a demonstration sport at these
Games.
   The first gold medal was to be awarded Sunday morning in the
women's air-rifle competition.
   The United States, Soviet Union and East Germany were expected
to garner the most medals.
   As a prelude to the Stadium ceremony today, a flotilla of nearly
400 boats sailed majestically on the nearby Han River, led by a
dragon drum ship.
   The stadium extravaganza, involving 1,500 performers, blended
taekwondo demonstrations, age-old Korean folk dances, electronic
synthesizers, rock music and sky divers.
   It also provided the first suspense of the Games in the form of
some white doves, who perched on the unlit Olympic torch basin as a
platform carrying flame-bearers rose upwards.
   When the torch was lit, exploding into an inferno, the doves
scattered, and it could not be determined if any were killed.

<HEAD>Attorney May Seek Genetic Tests Of Florida Girl In Baby-Swap Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney may seek a court-ordered
genetic test to determine if a 9{-year-old Florida girl is the
daughter of a Pennsylvania couple who filed suit claiming a
baby-switch conspiracy in 1978.
   Marvin Ellin, a Baltimore malpractice lawyer, said he will first
ask the girl's father to allow his daughter to be tested, but will
ask a court to mandate the test if he refuses, The Baltimore Sun
reported today.
   The girl's father said he would not allow her to be tested and
that they had the wrong child.
   The test would compare inherited factors in the girl's blood
with the blood chemistry of Ernest and Regina Twigg of Langhorne,
Pa.. The Twiggs are plaintiffs in a $100 million suit alleging
three doctors and a nurse at Hardee Memorial Hospital in Wauchula,
Fla., switched their healthy baby girl with a child suffering from
a congenital heart defect.
   The small hospital also was named as a defendant in the federal
suit.
   Mrs. Twigg said Friday she will seek custody of the girl if she
turns out to be her daughter and if she is not happy and safe. The
girl, whose mother died of cancer seven years ago, now lives with
her father.
   Arlena, the child Mrs. Twigg brought home from the hospital 10
years ago, died Aug. 23 at the Deborah Heart and Lung Center in
Browns Mills, N.J.
   The Twiggs discovered that Arlena's Type B blood made it
unlikely she was their daughter since they have Type O blood.
Sophisticated protein-matching tests at the Johns Hopkins
Immunogenetics Laboratory in Baltimore also concluded the child was
unrelated to the Twiggs.
   A third test known as ``genetic fingerprinting'' is scheduled to
begin next week.
   The Twiggs, who have seven surviving children, moved from
central Florida two years ago.
   Using public records, the St. Petersburg Times said Friday it
had located a blond, blue-eyed girl, the only other white girl
reported born at Hardee Memorial at the time Regina Twigg gave
birth, in a southwest Florida city.
   To protect the child, the paper did not identify her.
   Relatives of the girl discount the notion that she was part of a
baby-swapping scheme.
   ``My sympathy goes out to those people,'' the girl's father said
Thursday evening. ``They have every right to pursue their real
child. (My daughter) is not their child. ... She will never be
their child.''
   The father told the newspaper he knew nothing of any baby swap.
He would not disclose his daughter's blood type and said he would
resist any attempts to draw the girl into the Twiggs' battle. The
girl knows nothing of the search for her.
   ``Until they get an indictment or a conviction ... I have
nothing to say,'' he said. ``I'm an innocent bystander.''

   Rains stopped today and waters receded
further from the worst floods ever to hit Bangladesh, authorities
said.
   Water-borne diseases killed at least 28 more people, raising the
official death toll since flooding began in June to 932, officials
said.
   The government's official count is generally considered too low.
Dhaka newspapers estimate at least 1,888 people have died.
   Health officials said at least 57,881 cases of diarrhea have
been reported nationwide in the epidemic that has broken out in the
impoverished country of 110 million.
   At least 211 of those victims have died of diarrhea, caused by
drinking contaminated water, said the officials, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   An estimated 40 million people have been affected by the floods,
which have inundated 53 of the country's 64 administrative
districts.
   Rail links from the capital of Dhaka to large towns such as
Chittagong, the main port, and Sylhet, the business center, were
restored Friday following major repairs to the railroad bridge at
Tongi, on Dhaka's outskirts. The bridge was washed away by the
flooded Turag River at Tongi two weeks ago.
   A senior Communications Ministry official, also speaking on
condition of anonymity, said: ``We expect national highways and
inter-district roads to be driveable by the beginning of next
month, and rail communications to be functional in two weeks.''
   Refugees fleeing the floods sought shelter in Dhaka, a city of 6
million people. More than 1 million flood victims are being fed and
given shelter at municipal centers, officials said.

   Survivors of a fishing boat accident spent
18 hours clutching to a small life raft trying to stave off
disorienting hypothermia that caused the last victim to jump from
the raft into the Pacific Ocean.
   Five people survived, but four others died before being rescued
Friday by Coast Guard helicopters about 35 miles from the coast.
   Dr. Esther Sewell, who treated some of the survivors, said some
were in the life raft, some had hung onto the side and some clung
to a bulkhead that became detached from the 45-foot tuna fishing
charter boat Cougar as it sank.
   The last person to die was in the raft, Sewell said, but
hypothermia apparently made him confused.
   ``He saw the helicopter and he got out of the raft and started
swimming for it. He started taking off his life jacket,'' Sewell
said.
   One of the survivors, Clyde Sloan, 41, spent the entire 18 hours
in the water clinging to the side of the life raft, his relatives
said.
   ``He thought he was going to die,'' said his son, Rocky Sloan.
``My dad's friend died in his arms.''
   Sloan said his father told him all nine tied themselves together
and took turns in the life raft. When a woman in the raft died,
they tied her to the bulkhead and someone else took her place in
the raft, he said.
   After their rescue, the survivors were taken to Pacific
Communities Hospital in Newport, about 115 miles southwest of
Portland.
   The Coast Guard was still trying to determine exactly why the
charter boat went down in apparently calm seas.
   The boat's engine room apparently flooded, but the crew didn't
notice until the vessel already had begun to sink, said Veronica
Cady, of the Coast Guard public affairs office in Seattle.
   Five helicopters, two airplanes and the Coast Guard cutter Iris
participated in the search, which began Thursday night when the
Cougar, a former Navy launch, was reported overdue at Depoe Bay.
   The boat, owned by Depoe Bay Sports Fishing & Charter, was hired
for a day of tuna fishing.
   Helicopter crews located the survivors and three of the bodies
at about 10:30 a.m. Friday, about three hours after the search had
resumed. A fourth body was located nearby a few hours later.
   The boat was equipped with citizens band and marine radios, but
no distress calls had been monitored on any frequencies, said Coast
Guard Capt. Michael Lovett.
   The dead were identified as Pat Watson, 40, owner and operator
of the boat; Rick Moore, 26, of Depoe Bay, a crewman; Richard
Boxwell, 36, of Corvallis, and Hallie Wynne, no age available, of
Lincoln City.
   Along with Sloan, the survivors were identified as Andy Liddell,
34, of Depoe Bay, a charter boat skipper who was acting as a
crewman; Dale Powell, 56, of Aumsville; Peter Russell Erickson, 47,
of Albany, Ill., and Gary Williams, no age available, of Lincoln
City.
   Three of the survivors were admitted to the Newport hospital in
serious condition suffering from hypothermia, and two were treated
for exposure and released, said hospital administrator Tom Olsen.

   Two towns on the Chinese-Soviet border will begin
tourist exchanges across the Amur River, the official China Daily
said today. The river towns were once the scene of bloody military
clashes between the two nations.
   Officials of Heihe in China and Blagoveshchensk in the Soviet
Union agreed daylong tours will be organized, with the first group
of 40 Chinese crossing the river later this month. The newspaper
said two exchanges a month are planned between the two river towns.
   In 1969, the two communist powers engaged in border fighting
along the Amur, or Heilongjiang, River and the Ussuri River of
northeast China.
   The two nations began normalizing economic and other
non-political ties in 1982, and border trade now is thriving.

<HEAD>Li Peng Says Summit Possible, China Seeks Better Ties With Soviets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Premier Li Peng said today that a Chinese-Soviet
summit can be held if lower-level meetings bring the two sides
closer together on issues such as Cambodia.
   He also denied that the leadership is split over how to proceed
with troubled economic reforms and said that reports of major
resistance to reform are groundless.
   The premier, meeting with The Associated Press board of
directors and executives, said improved relations with Moscow were
in the interests of China and world peace and would not threaten
China's ties with Japan and the West.
   It was the most favorable Chinese response yet to the Soviet
Union's repeated invitations for a summit meeting to end a
quarter-century of estrangement between the communist neighbors.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev renewed the invitation in a
speech Friday in Siberia in which he said he was ready to begin
summit preparations without delay.
   The People's Daily and the official English-language China Daily
reported Gorbachev's offer without comment.
   Although Li noted China's longstanding ``three obstacles'' to a
Chinese-Soviet summit, he seemed to play down the differences while
emphasizing that China ``would like very much to normalize
relations.''
   The three obstacles are the Soviet troop presence in
Afghanistan, the nine-year occupation of Cambodia by Soviet-allied
Vietnam, and the heavy Soviet troop presence on its border with
China.
   Progress recently has been made in all three areas.
   Li, speaking through an official interpreter at Beijing's
Diaoyutai state guesthouse, said the most important issue was for
Vietnam to pull out of Cambodia. Hanoi has already begun a partial
troop withdrawal from the embattled country.
   Chinese and Soviet negotiations who met last month to discuss
Cambodia were ``relatively close'' on the need for a Vietnamese
withdrawal, he said.
   ``It still takes a series of negotiations between the two sides
to bring their views closer together,'' Li said. ``Once there is
further agreement the subject of a summit meeting will be placed on
the agenda.''
   China has consistently used the leverage of a potential summit
meeting to try to resolve one of its primary security concerns: the
fear of an expansionist Vietnam on its southern border.
   Li said Chinese-Soviet relations could not return to the
comraderie of the 1950s, when the two nations were close allies and
the Soviet Union sent thousands of technicians to help develop
industry in China, which was devastated by a civil war.
   The two countries split bitterly in the early 1960s over
strategic and ideological differences.
   Li also sought to reassure Japan and the West, with whom China
has developed friendly ties and trade in the past decade, that they
have nothing to fear from a Soviet-Chinese rapproachment.
   ``Improvement of Chinese-Soviet relations will not impair
relations between China and the United States, and it will be in
the interests of world peace,'' Li said.
   In his 40-minute interview, Li stressed that ``rumors going
around the world'' of a serious rift in the Chinese leadership were
untrue. ``All this is groundless,'' he said.
   Li, who heads the government, claimed in particular that there
is no political division between himself and Zhao Ziyang, general
secretary of the Communist Party.
   Li is regarded as more cautious toward reforms that will reduce
the role of central planning in running the economy, while Zhao is
thought to be China's strongest advocate for bold steps to
introduce market-oriented principles.
   Reports in the Hong Kong and Western press have speculated that
Zhao's powers have declined as a result of the 20 percent inflation
rate, out-of-control public spending, panic buying and corruption
that now plague the economy.
   In the past month the government has taken several measures to
calm consumers and cool off the economy, including pegging bank
interest rates to inflation to end runs on banks and pledging there
will be no more price hikes this year.
   Li said these decisions were made by top party and government
leaders ``under the directorship of General Secretary Zhao Ziyang
and some were proposed by him himself.''

<HEAD>Libya Allegedly Training Guerrillas To Topple Kenyan Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prosecutor claimed that Libya is
training Kenyan guerrillas to topple President Daniel arap Moi's
government, Nairobi newspapers reported today.
   The three English-language newspapers also published photographs
of nine men who allegedly have traveled to Libya for guerrilla
training since April.
   Kenya last year accused Libya of training 200 Kenyans in
guerrilla warfare to overthrow the government. Officials said
Kenyan dissidents abroad had promised money to the trainees. The
government later closed the Libyan Embassy in Nairobi after
accusing diplomats of operating a spy ring.
   The prosecutor made the claim in the court case of Gibson Maina
Kimani.
   Kimani was sentenced Friday to seven years in prison after he
pleaded guilty to charges of possessing seditious literature from
the clandestine Kenya Patriotic Front and the Kenya Revolutionary
Movement.
   It was the first time officials acknowledged the existence of
the rebel groups. The Kenya Patriotic Front is allegedly led by
Koigi wa Wamwere, a former legislator living in exile in Norway,
and the Kenya Revolutionary Movement, is said to be led by Raila
Odinga.
   Odinga, the elder son of former vice president and government
critic, Oginga Odinga, was detained Sept. 9 under security laws
that allow for detention without trial. He and nine other detainees
had been freed Feb. 5.
   Odinga was Kenya's longest-serving detainee under Moi, having
been detained after an abortive 1982 coup by disgruntled junior
officers in the air force.
   Bernard Chunga, deputy public prosector, said in court that
Kimani, a businessman, helped coordinate activities between the two
opposition groups.
   Chunga said Kimani met Wamwere three times this year, twice in
Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and once in Kampala, Uganda, to discuss
recruitment of men to receive guerilla training in Libya.
   Wamwere, Chunga said, gave Kimani $1,666 to recruit potential
trainee guerrillas at a Feb. 11 meeting in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
This was in addition to $289 Kimani had received by mail, the
prosecutor said.
   Chunga said Kimani escorted three recruits to Tanzania on April
29 and they left for Libya May 16.
   Chunga said Kimani learned Odinga headed the Kenya Revolutionary
Movement when he delivered a letter from Wamwere after a May 27
meeting in Kampala, Uganda.
   Kimani then met Odinga June 26 and later provided travel
documents for other recruits from the Kenya Revolutionary Movement,
the prosecutor said. They flew to Libya from Dar es Salaam on Aug.
22, Chunga added.
   The government has recently been cracking down on members of the
opposition. More than 80 people _ including lawyers, journalists,
civil servants, university lecturers and students _ have been
jailed for admitting links with banned opposition groups.
   Human rights groups such as the London-based Amnesty
International claim confessions have been coerced.

   A gunman killed a restaurant worker today
as he served coffee to customers, and police blamed the attack on
Basque separatists.
   The gunman fled in a car after shooting Jose Luis Barrios in the
San Jorge Restaurant, police said. The 34-year-old, whose father
owns the restaurant, was the only person hurt in the attack at 1
a.m.
   An anonymous caller who said he spoke for the Basque separatist
organization ETA told a traveler's bureau in Santurce that a man
whose car had been stolen was tied to a tree in the nearby town of
Baracaldo.
   Police later located the man who said two men had stolen his car
at gunpoint at 10 p.m. Friday. Police were checking to determine if
the stolen car was used by the gunman who carried out the killing.
   Police did not know why the attacker singled out Barrios or the
San Jorge Restaurant, which is owned by Prospero Barrios, a former
Socialist city councilman in Santurce.
   The caller did not claim responsibility for the killing on
behalf of ETA, which seeks independence from Spain for the
three-province northern Basque region. Since taking up arms in
1968, ETA has taken responsibility for killing 600 people, mainly
police, military and paramilitary Civil Guard officers.
   So far this year, ETA has claimed responsibility for attacks
that have killed 10 people in the Basque country, including a
discotheque owner and a restaurant owner who ETA said were involved
in drug trafficking.

   A Solidarity leader today said Interior
Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak told members of the independent labor
movement that he sees a future for the banned group but refused to
promise legalization.
   Wladyslaw Frasyniuk described the six-hour meeting he attended
Friday, and said the opposition side emerged ``with a feeling of
victory.''
   At the meeting, Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa and government
officials agreed to hold broad-based talks in mid-October to focus
on national problems and the future of Solidarity.
   ``Our positions got closer. I am satisfied,'' a tired-looking
Walesa said after the meeting at a government guest house outside
Warsaw.
   Walesa last month persuaded striking workers to end a wave of
walkouts after obtaining the government's agreement to hold talks.
He had not met with the government for six years.
   For the first time Friday, other Solidarity members and
representatives of the official trade union alliance OPZZ were
brought into talks to prepare for October's discussions.
   According to Frasyniuk, the leader of a Solidarity chapter in
the southwestern city of Wroclaw, Gen. Kiszczak told opposition
representatives that he sees a place for Solidarity in Poland's
future but could not take a decision now because his hands are tied.
   Alternate Politburo member Stanislaw Ciosek told the meeting
there was strong resistance to the idea of legalizating Solidarity
among the police and army, who ``fear this symbol,'' according to
Frasyniuk.
   ``They clearly said, `Give us time,''' Frasyniuk said.
   There was no immediate government confirmation of Frasyniuk's
account.
   Frasyniuk told reporters that the union decided to continue
talks even without a firm commitment because it did not want to be
seen as being the first to break off the process of negotiation.
   After the meeting, participants had ``a feeling of victory,'' he
said. ``You could see that the problem of Solidarity was the
dominant one, and nobody directly attacked Solidarity.''
   The trade union movement, the first ever permitted in the Soviet
bloc, was broken up in 1981 under martial law and later banned.
   The meeting, the second between Walesa and communist authorities
in two days, was called to set terms for a round-table meeting of
groups, including Solidarity, that represent various sectors of
Polish society. They are to address major Polish problems,
including the future of the outlawed Solidarity and of trade union
pluralism.
   ``Some bitter things were traded,'' said mediator Andrzej
Stelmachowski.
   The recent labor unrest posed the most serious threat to
Solidarity since it was crushed in 1981.
   Stelmachowski, a law professor who has been the go-between in
arranging the meetings, reported that no decisions were taken ``but
there was some progress.''
   In the Soviet Union, meanwhile, the state-run media softened
their hard-line support of the Polish government, saying both
officials and protesters are to blame for many of Poland's problems
and that the two should compromise.
   The daily newspapers Sovietskaya Rossiya and Izvestia carried
commentaries Friday suggesting that workers were driven to strike
by the government's mishandling of sharp price increases in the
spring.
   Sovietskaya Rossiya said trust in Poland's government has eroded
so badly that the leadership may not survive.
   ``Will the incumbent government stay in power or will it resign?
This issue has become a political reality and will be discussed by
the Polish parliament,'' wrote V. Runov, Warsaw correspondent for
the official Tass news agency. The dispatch appeared in Sovietskaya
Rossiya.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II today preached peace
and reconciliation in northern Mozambique, where a 13-year civil
conflict has forced 1 million to flee and left 6 million at the
edge of famine.
   The Roman Catholic leader traveled from Maputo, the capital, to
this Indian Ocean port city in the devastated north, where he
celebrated Mass before thousands of people, including many refugees.
   The pope lamented ``the prevailing situation of insecurity due
to violence which ... generates violence, anxiety and distress,
leaving limited space for freedom.''
   Beira, which has port and rail facilities that reach into
landlocked African nations, has been a frequent target of attacks
by rebels of the Mozambique National Resistance, known by their
Portuguese acronyn as Renamo.
   The rebels in a statement today from Portugal claimed their
troops killed 46 soldiers from Mozambique and Zimbabwe in the last
30 days, including one near Vila de Mungari, southwest of Beira.
Rebel leader Alfonso Dhlakama also said he hoped the papal visit
would contribute to peace in Mozambique.
   Some Mozambican bishops have been urging President Joaquim
Chissano's Marxist government to start talks with the rebels. John
Paul told Chissano Friday night that ``the efforts of my brother
bishops in Mozambique have always received my backing.''
   The Marxist government, however, has refused to negotiate and
has criticized the bishops for advocating talk with ``armed
bandits.''
   ``The weapons we are still obliged to carry are used exclusively
to defend our country's freedom and our nation,'' Chissano told the
pope.
   The Mozambican army, assisted by Zimbabwean forces, has been
able to keep the rail lines running for the past year.
   Renamo guerrillas also have been extremely active in Nampula
province, where the pope will stop this afternoon for a meeting
with local Roman Catholic clergy.
   The conflict that started in 1975 between the government and the
guerrillas has forced about 1 million Mozambicans to flee into
neighboring countries and left an estimated 6 million of
Mozambique's 14.5 million people in need of food aid, according to
relief organizations.
   The anti-Marxist guerrillas, believed to number between
12,000-22,000, are able to roam the countryside almost at will.
   No government acknowledges assisting the rebels, who have caused
tremendous economic damage and have been accused of widespread
civilian atrocities. Renamo denies the charges.
   The U.S. State Department, in a report released in April,
estimated the rebels had killed 100,000 civilians in the past two
to three years.
   Earlier this week, Renamo announced a unilateral cease-fire
during the pope's visit and wished the pontiff a good stay.
Nonetheless, Mozambique announced extensive security measures for
the pope and the pilgrims traveling to see him.
   Mozambique is the final stop on the pope's 10-day tour of
southern Africa. He has visited Zimbabwe, Botswana, Swaziland and
Lesotho and made a brief, unscheduled stop in South Africa after
his plane was diverted in bad weather.
   Mozambique, which also has been ravaged by drought in recent
years, receives most of its military assistance from the Soviet
Union, but increasingly has been making overtures to Western
nations.
   The United States is the largest donor of food aid to
Mozambique, and Britain has been providing military training.
   Mozambique also has been working to improve relations with
neighboring South Africa, which has backed Renamo in the past.
South Africa says it stopped supporting the guerrillas under terms
of a 1984 mutual non-aggression pact, but Mozambique has continued
to charge South Africa with providing assistance.

   Republicans are planning to whittle away at
Democratic-proposed increases in the $3.35 minimum wage for the
first time in eight years through a subminimum ``training'' wage _
but not until next week.
   With many senators taking Friday off to campaign for re-election
in their home states, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, was unwilling to
risk a vote on a Democratic measure aimed at killing his proposal
for a 80 percent subminimum wage.
   Under the Hatch proposal, employers could pay the ``training''
wage during the first 90 days a worker is on their payroll.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., the chief author of the mininum
wage bill, was ready to vote Friday on his proposal to double the
number of student exemptions that employers can now use to pay
part-time workers 15 percent below the wage floor _ or $2.85 an
hour presently.
   Hatch called Kennedy's proposal a ``mock training wage,'' saying
it would would not give employers any incentive to ``open the door
to those who have nothing, who are undereducated and unskilled.''
   He said his subminimum training wage advocated by the Reagan
administration, Vice President George Bush and Bush's running mate,
Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind., could ``create hundreds of thousands of
new jobs.''
   With presidential and congressional elections just eight weeks
away, President Reagan, Bush and other Republicans have softened
their opposition to any increase, but have not said how large it
should be.
   In June, Quayle offered before the Senate Labor Committee a
proposed raise to $4 an hour over two years but coupled it with a
subminimum training wage. The measure was never voted on.
   Bush, campaigning in Ohio, said Friday that a lower training
wage, the administration's euphemism for a subminimum rate that it
has advocated since 1981, must accompany any increase for him to
support it.
   Kennedy called the Republican proposals a Trojan Horse, saying
Quayle's proposal for a $4 minimum wage amounts to a 10 percent cut
in buying power after taking inflation into account from when
Reagan and Bush took office.
   ``And from that miserly floor, he proposes a further cut for all
new hires,'' Kennedy said. ``Can this be what George Bush means
when he talks about a kinder, gentler America?''
   Kennedy's bill would raise the minimum wage 40 cents an hour in
each of the next three years _ to $3.75 in 1989; $4.15 in 1990 and
$4.55 in 1991 _ directly benefitting about 15 million workers now
paid less than $4.50 an hour.
   Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said he hoped to get a
vote on Kennedy's and Hatch's different subminimum proposals next
Tuesday and a vote on final passage by the end of next week.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said the House will take up
and ``likely pass'' it as soon as the Senate acts.

   Police rounded up 225 people on a variety of
felony and misdemeanor charges in the latest of several sweeps
aimed at ridding city streets of violent gang activity, authorities
said Saturday.
   The sweep, which began Friday evening and concluded early
Saturday, was conducted in crime-ridden inner-city areas, police
Detective David Powers said.
   Police Officer Jim Farris said 225 people, 146 of them suspected
gang members, were either cited or taken into custody for offenses
ranging from minor traffic violations to possession of guns and
drugs.
   There was no violence involved in any of the arrests, he said.
   In all, police arrested 39 adults and 23 juveniles on felony
charges, Farris said.
   Officers also seized two guns and $250 in cash, Farris said.
   The sweep involved 200 officers who took part in the
department's ``Hammer'' task force, so named by Police Chief Daryl
Gates.

<TEXT>
   A state appeals court that upheld the fraud
conviction of Salvatore ``Bill'' Bonnano rejected a claim by the
son of reputed Mafia boss Joseph Bonnano that he was the victim of
discriminatory prosecution.
   A 3-0 decision of the 1st District Court of Appeal on Friday
upheld the 1985 conviction and four-year prison sentence of the
younger Bonnano for cheating elderly residents out of $45,000 in a
home improvement scheme.
   Although another man, Anthony Insana, committed most of the acts
in the scheme and was given immunity from prosecution for his
testimony, the jury could well have concluded that Bonnano ``was
often the motivating force behind Insana's `rip-offs,''' said the
opinion by Justice William Newsom.
   The ruling also said Bonnano had failed to prove that
authorities were out to get him because of his ``notorious family
background.''
   Prosecutors said Bonnano and Insana cooperated in a scheme to
cheat customers of Insana's contracting company. The victims were
homeowners, most of them elderly, who bought home improvement
contracts.
   Largely through the testimony of Insana, Bonnano was convicted
of eight grand theft charges, involving $45,700 taken from four
people between October 1977 and January 1978, and of conspiracy to
commit grand theft. He was acquitted of 10 other grand theft
charges.
   The appeals judges rejected Bonnano's argument that the
convictions were improperly based on the uncorroborated testimony
of an accomplice, Insana. They also rejected Bonnano's claim that
Insana should have been declared incompetent to testify because he
was allegedly an alcoholic.

   Rambo clones and mercenaries spoiling for
a fight invaded a Strip hotel for a Soldier of Fortune convention
this weekend, doting over exotic weapons and attending lectures on
battles to be won in far-off places.
   Meanwhile, the promoter of the event collected donations in
large glass bottles to help fight a $9.4 million judgment awarded
by a Texas court that ruled his Soldier of Fortune magazine was
used to recruit a contract killer.
   Before the weekend was over, the 8th annual convention was
expected to draw several hundred competitors for a wide range of
paramilitary events.
   Participants spent the earlier part of the week attending
shooting matches and learning survival, commando and defensive
techniques. Seminars ranged from air operations in Nicaragua to
Middle East terrorism and new Soviet weaponry.
   In addition, some 7,000 visitors were expected to browse through
an exhibit hall filled with knives, stun guns, semi-automatic
pistols, high-powered sniper rifles and assault weapons.
   One gray-haired woman, clad in a camouflage hat, slacks and
jacket and a T-shirt touting the Survival Store gun shop, huffed
her way up a disabled escalator to a convention area where some 200
exhibitors were displaying their weapons.
   Intratec of Miami featured its new Scorpion, a pistol capable of
firing 30 rounds as fast as the finger can squeeze the trigger.
   ``It's for defense and recreation,'' said company spokesman Tom
Conrad. ``It's great for a family, for recreational shooting. A
child can handle it. It's great for plinking tin cans.''
   The company also is promoting a weapon less than 5 inches long
that fits in the palm of a hand, touting it as ``a very affordable
insurance policy.''
   Action Arms of Philadelphia promoted a range of weapons as ``New
Toys for the Big Boys.'' Among the weapons was a 32-round Uzi
pistol, less than 10 inches long, manufactured by Israel Military
Industries.
   At the end of one aisle, a man on a videotape discussed ``the
myth of shooting to wound versus shooting to kill,'' saying the
latter was the smarter policy.
   Ed Ciammitti, vice president of the Guardian Spy Shop, Phoenix,
talked of personal security items such as tear gas, stun guns up to
100,000 volts, a strobe light that temporarily blinds an attacker
and a new dry powder that swells an attacker's eyes and throat,
making it hard to see and breathe.
   T-shirt vendors were doing a booming business, with messages
such as ``Mercenaries Never Die: They Just Go to Hell to Regroup,''
``Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap,'' ``Fight Crime _ Shoot Back'' and
``Gun Control is Being Able to Hit Your Target.''
   Bumper stickers implored ``Boycott Jane Fonda'' and ``Pardon
Ollie _ Indict Congress.''
   Throughout the exhibit hall and registration areas were giant
bottles for donations to various causes, including the Omega First
Amendment Legal Fund, to be used to fight a $9.4 million judgment
levied against Soldier of Fortune magazine in a Houston case.
   The lawsuit claimed that Robert Black hired a hit man through
the magazine's personal services classified ads, and the hit man
killed Black's wife, Sandra Black of Bryan, Texas, on Feb. 21,
1985. The magazine was found negligent for publishing the ad.
   Robert Brown, editor and publisher of the Boulder, Colo.-based
magazine, said in a statement to conventioneers that it would be
impossible for a publication to track down and verify each
advertiser's ``hidden agenda.''
   Black is on Texas death row for paying John Wayne Hearn $10,000
to kill Mrs. Black. Hearn is serving three life terms for the Black
slaying and two other killings in Florida.

five women, the official Xinhua News Agency said Saturday.
   The report said the awarding ceremony was Friday, two days after
the People's Liberation Army named 17 men to the post of general.
   The five women major generals are now the only women generals in
the army. They are:
   _Nie Li, vice-director of the Science and Technology Committee

   _Hu Feipei, vice president of army's Louyang Foreign Languages

   Xinhua said Li Zhen, a Long March veteran, became China's first
woman general in 1955. Mao Tse-tung eliminated ranks in 1965.

   Radical students demonstrating against
the Olympic Games and the government have seen their support
dwindle to a handful of diehards, and most Koreans have rejected
their violent extremism.
   The radical movement has lost ground as hope grows in South
Korea that political reforms will end the nation's long tradition
of authoritarian rule and produce an enduring democratic system.
   Many Koreans, including a growing number of students, say
violent anti-government protests are no longer necessary. People
are increasingly critical of the radicals.
   ``Students know the people are against these demonstrations,'' a
student leader said.
   Demonstrations against the Olympics, which began Saturday, have
been small by Korean standards with the turnout dropping each day.
Protests have been confined to campuses away from the Olympic
venues and many have been peaceful.
   The government helped to defuse the protests by ordering riot
police to avoid clashes if possible and not to use tear gas during
the Olympics. Radicals marching out of colleges for violent
protests several times found no police waiting to confront them and
ended up dispersing in confusion.
   But violence has not disappeared completely. Protesting radicals
hurled firebombs at runners escorting the Olympic torch to Seoul
last week but failed to stop it. On Saturday, riot police beat
radical students who staged an anti-Olympic protest in the heart of
Seoul. About 20 protesters were arrested.
   Student leaders say the Olympics should have been shared with
communist North Korea to help reunite the Korean peninsula. They
claimed the Games were being used to keep the two Koreas divided.
   ``We must oppose single-host Olympics which prolong dictatorship
and perpetuate nation division,'' said a student leader, who like
other radicals spoke on condition of anonymity.
   North Korea boycotted the Olympics after its demand to co-host
the Games was rejected. The peninsula was divided in 1945.
   The radicals hoped to use the Games to continue anti-government
protests by claiming they were being used to cement authoritarian
rule. Radicals say President Roh Tae-woo's government is a front
for military rule and insist there have been no political reforms.
   ``The Olympics are being used to cement the fascist regime,''
one student leader told a recent demonstration.
   Roh, a former general who took office in February, introduced
broad reforms and most forms of political activity are now legal
after years of repression. Even the main opposition parties agree
that Roh is making an effort to build democracy.
   The changing political climate began to erode support for the
radical movement this year. Once the spearhead for political change
in South Korea, the movement began losing many students because
they no longer saw the need for violent protests.
   The departure of moderate students enabled leftist hardliners to
take control of the student groups. The hardliners have attempted
to compensate for their smaller numbers with more violent tactics.
   But the call for anti-Olympic protests has attracted little
support.
   Top opposition leader Kim Dae-jung said even the radical leaders
realize that the great majority of South Koreans want the Games to
be a success. Koreans see the Olympics as a way to put the country
in the front rank of nations.
   ``The students know they will not be supported by our people,''
Kim said in an interview.
   Onlookers have jeered protesting radicals at several
demonstrations, criticizing them for ruining South Korea's image at
a time when world attention was focused on the country.
   ``Go home. You are shaming our nation,'' screamed an angry old
man at protesters at one demonstration.
   While the radicals have lost support, political observers say
they cannot be ignored because of their willingness to use
violence. A change in the political situation or loss of confidence
in the government could revive the radicals' support, they add.
   Radicals form less than 10 percent of about 1 million college
students. Other students may like some of the radicals' ideas, but
reject their violent tactics.
   The radicals come from all social and economic backgrounds.
Children of senior officials and military officers join children of
workers and poor farmers in campus groups, united by a common
idealism and anger over years of oppressive rule.
   The radicals say they are fighting for creation of an idealistic
``society of the masses'' with students, workers and peasants
uniting to end oppression, poverty and exploitation. But the
radicals often are vague about their goals.
   ``We feel in our hearts that something must be done now. People
just talk and the government uses that to continue its rule. We
must act to force change,'' said one leader.

   Riot police Saturday dispersed and
beat radical students who staged an anti-Olympic protest in the
heart of the capital on the opening day of the Olympics. About 20
protesters were arrested.
   Students later held a rally at Korea University in the north of
Seoul and burned an effigy painted with an American flag in the
shape of a nuclear bomb.
   ``Oppose dictator's Olympics,'' students chanted at both
protests.
   About 200 students shouting anti-Olympic slogans tried to march
through Seoul's main shopping district towards Myongdong Cathedral
to protest the opening of the Games. The brief protest was held
about 10 miles from the Olympic venues.
   Scores of riot police charged the march after it had gone about
150 yards. Police roughly dispersed the protesters.
   Riot police punched and kicked protesters and arrested about 20
who were forced into a bus and taken away. Others protesters fled
as police chased them.
   It was the first protest staged in the city center in several
weeks. Protesters did not attempt to fight police.
   Nearly 10,000 Olympic athletes from 160 countries opened the
biggest athletic show on earth Saturday under a massive security
blanket and the jealous glare of communist North Korea.
   A colorful, 3{-hour spectacle, mixing ancient Korean rituals
with space-age technology, kicked off 16 days of athletic
competition at the Summer Games. The Games will produce the first
all-out East-West gold rush since the 1976 Games in Montreal.
   Later Saturday, about 300 students staged an anti-American
protest at Korea University. They denounced the South Korea and
U.S. governments and demanded the Olympics be shared with communist
North Korea.
   ``Yankee go home,'' students shouted as they shot their fists
into the air.
   About 400 riot police kept watch outside the school, but did not
intervene and students dispersed without a confrontation.
   Radical students have staged many protests against the Olympics
and the government of President Roh Tae-woo.
   The radicals are demanding the Olympics be shared with North
Korea to help unify the two Koreas which were divided at the end of
World War II in 1945 and which fought the 1950-1953 Korean War
   North Korea boycotted the Olympics after its demand to co-host
the Games was turned down by the International Olympic Committee.
   The radicals contend the United States helps to enforce the
partition of the Korean peninsula. Radicals demand the expulsion of
the 42,000 U.S. troops based in the nation under a mutual defense
treaty.

   Subscribers to Index on Censorship got a surprise
this month. Instead of the usual reports of suppression of free
speech by dictatorships, the entire issue of the small but
respected journal was devoted to Britain.
   It reflected growing alarm among editors, broadcasters and civil
libertarians that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government is
adding censorship to Britain's already extensive official secrecy.
   From repeated attempts to suppress news about Northern Ireland
to a worldwide government campaign to ban the publication of an
intelligence veteran's memoirs, the list of recent controversies
over media freedom has grown dramatically.
   ``If freedom is diminished in the United Kingdom, where
historically it has deep roots, it is potentially diminished
everywhere,'' wrote Matthew Hoffman, an assistant editor of the
Independent newspaper. Hoffman edited the special issue of the
Index of Censorship, a monthly journal on freedom of speech and
censorship.
   Mrs. Thatcher insists she is trying to bolster national
security, deny terrorists a platform and restore discipline to a
leaky civil service. But during her nine-year tenure, Britain has
gained a reputation as the most secretive of the Western
democracies.
   ``Secrecy from the top of our society to the bottom is
preventing newspapers from telling the public what is really
happening,'' the Guild of British Newspaper Editors charged in a
recent report, ``Officially Secret.''
   The problem was underscored when Mrs. Thatcher ignored calls to
explain a mysterious incident in which a Cuban diplomat was
expelled last week after firing a gun on a London street.
   Those who felt the public was entitled to know why lives were
put in danger received a stock response: The government never
``makes statements on matters relating to national security.''
   The March shooting of three Irish Republican Army members on a
bombing mission in Gibraltar also stirred the secrecy debate.
   When two British television companies turned up witness'
accounts suggesting soldiers deliberately shot to death the three
men instead of trying to arrest them, the government pressured the
networks to suppress the films, arguing they would prejudice the
inquest.
   The networks refused and the films were screened on schedule.
   Other incidents have raised concern over official secrecy:
   _A police raid on British Broadcasting Corp. studios to seize
tapes of a documentary about a secret spy satellite.
   _A legal bid this year to stop BBC radio broadcasting from
interviews with current and former members of the intelligence
services.
   _The confiscation of unscreened TV film of street violence in
Belfast; a court order delaying screening of a film about an
IRA-related trial.
   _The banning of a BBC film about an IRA sympathizer that
provoked a one-day protest strike at the BBC.
   Overshadowing all for sheer cost and persistence is the Thatcher
administration's worldwide two-year court battle to suppress
``Spycatcher,'' the memoirs of retired intelligence operative Peter
Wright.
   Mrs. Thatcher says she is defending a principle _ the life-long
oath of secrecy taken by secret agents. She has lost her battle in
foreign courts, but in Britain it drags on. The Guardian and
Observer newspapers are still fighting in court to publish extracts
of ``Spycatcher.''
   In Bath, southern England, bookseller Peter Marsh this month
received a summons for contempt of court for selling copies of
``Spycatcher'' that had been imported from Ireland.
   Marsh works alone and said he could be bankrupted by legal
costs, but added in a telephone interview: ``I sell books, it's my
living and I don't see why I should be deprived of that right
because of some overweening authority.''
   Since coming to office in 1979, Mrs. Thatcher's government has
used the all-embracing 1911 Official Secrets Act in at least 24
prosecutions, compared with 34 the previous 68 years. The act makes
it an offense for a civil servant to disclose any information,
however trivial, without authorization.
   The government has unveiled a proposed reform confining the act
mainly to defense, intelligence and foreign relations matters,
saying this would dispel any notion it was being used to protect
the government from embarrassment.
   But the proposals reinforce the lifetime gag on intelligence
officers and shield the intelligence services from any
parliamentary scrutiny.
   Some newspapers have responded by printing sensitive stories
under headlines pointing out that under the new law, such stories
will be unpublishable.
   Novelist John Mortimer wrote in Index of Censorship: ``In
healthier days most newspapers ... attacked the government of the
day, whichever government it might be. Now, however, too many
journalists censor themselves.''
   Maurice Frankel, chairman of the Campaign for Freedom of
Information, which is pressing for a U.S.-style law, said, ``Press
freedom is deteriorating ... And it's notable how relatively little
opposition there's been from the press itself.''
   Ronald Dworkin, professor of jurisprudence at Oxford University,
concluded in Index on Censorship: ``Censorship is no longer an
isolated exception. ... The sad truth is that the very concept of
liberty is being challenged and corroded by the Thatcher
government.''

   Attending a school where the ratio of
women to men is 63-to-1 may seem like heaven to some young men, but
for the first seven full-time male students admitted to Centenary
College in 78 years, it can be a little strange.
   Ken Strauss, a 21-year-old junior from Mount Olive, acknowledged
that he was ``a little uncomfortable with all girls in class'' but
said he was able to adjust by the time he attended his second class
after school opened Sept. 7.
   Strauss, a psychology and elementary education major, recalls
how a female student saw him standing outside a classroom and
mistook him for the professor.
   ``Most of the girls are friendly. It seems like they know me
more than I know them,'' said Richard West, 21, a freshman business
major.
   West said his decision to attend the school was supported by all
his friends _ except his girlfriend, who is a sophomore.
   ``She's not too happy about my going here,'' West said.
   West doesn't expect to be distracted by his female counterparts,
or at least ``not so much on my part but on the girls' part because
I'm the new element.''
   Centenary College was founded in this northwestern New Jersey
town as a coeducational preparatory school in 1867. Admission was
limited to girls in 1910 and Centenary became a women's junior
college in 1940. The four-year college was formed in 1976, and men
were allowed to enroll only in the Continuing Education Division,
consisting mainly of night classes. In April, the trustees decided
to admit male students full time.
   Dorothy Prisco, vice president for academic affairs and dean of
the college, said the board decided it was ``the right time and the
right circumstances'' to admit men full time.
   She said the school responded to the success of the continuing
education division and the fact that male students were requesting
admission to full-time programs.
   ``We felt very strongly that we were operating from a foundation
of constraints and that it was the time to go coeducational,'' she
said.
   ``It certainly broadens the perspective of the classes,'' Ms.
Prisco said. ``The teaching challenge, I think, becomes greater ...
the richness of discussion in class becomes greater ... it brings a
whole new perspective.
   ``However, it doesn't mean that we are going to forsake our
mission of providing a strong education for women. I don't think we
have to give up one for the other.''
   Total enrollment is about 450 students. There were 192 incoming
students in 1987, down from 235 in 1986 and 261 in 1985, according
to admissions department statistics.
   Adding male minds to the campus will not precipitate changes in
the curriculum, Ms. Prisco said.
   ``I think we have strong academic programs and I think that's
why we have the seven male students ... because they've realized
our programs are strong,'' she said.
   All seven are commuters, but dormitory space for men will be
available in 1989, Ms. Prisco said.
   John Stowe, 23, a transfer student who lives within walking
distance, said he decided to attend Centenary because it is a
small, private school.
   ``I enjoy the campus and it's terribly convenient for me,'' he
said. ``It's been a really neat experience for me ... but it is a
little strange walking into a room full of girls and not seeing
another guy there.''
   Stowe's girlfriend also is not too happy with his choice of
academic institutions.
   ``She's not pleased a bit but she's getting over that,'' he said.

<HEAD>Aquino Says U.S. Must Respond To Soviet Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino said
Saturday the United States must decide whether to accept a Soviet
offer and close its bases here in return for a Soviet pullout from
a strategic garrison in Vietnam.
   On Friday, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev offered to abandon
its naval facilities in Cam Ranh Bay if the United States removed
its six military installations from the Philippines.
   ``That is for the two superpowers to discuss and to talk
about,'' Mrs. Aquino told reporters. She gave no indication whether
her government will make any recommendation to Washington over the
Soviet offer.
   Other Filipino officials also reacted cautiously to Gorbachev's
offer, which was part of a seven-point plan for reducing tensions
in Asia.
   Gorbachev's proposal came during growing opposition to the bases
here and against the backdrop of deadlocked U.S.-Philippine talks
over the future of the installations, which include Clark Air Base,
Subic Bay Naval Base and four smaller installations.
   Talks between the United States and the Philippines over the
final two years of the 1947 Military Bases Agreement have stalled
over compensation and other issues.
   On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said in
Washington that the United States wanted to keep Clark, Subic and
four other installations in the Philippines but that Manila's
demands for more money were too high.
   Shultz met this week in Washington with Filipino Foreign
Secretary Raul Manglapus to discuss the impasse but neither side
announced any progress.
   The United States pays about $180 million a year for use of the
six bases. Manglapus has said the Americans have offered about $502
million in compensation, but he said the Philippine demand for $1.2
billion a year would be a ``reasonable'' figure.
   The agreement expires in 1991, and Mrs. Aquino has refused to
say whether she will allow the bases to remain after that.
   In a statement to reporters, Sen. Leticia Shahani, chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Soviet and U.S.
military facilities were not comparable and that the Clark and
Subic bases were ``far bigger complexes'' than Cam Ranh Bay.
   Two other senators, Heherson Alvarez and Rene Saguisag, welcomed
the Gorbachev proposal but warned that the issue would require
careful study.
   In other developments, the government announced Saturday that
Mrs. Aquino ordered the cancellation of the passport of the founder
of the outlawed Communist Party of the Philippines after the
military claimed he had resumed leadership of the rebel movement.
   The statement released by the presidential palace said Mrs.
Aquino issued the order Friday against Jose Maria Sison, whom she
freed from prison in 1986. Sison left the country six months later
and is believed to be in Western Europe.
   The military said Sison has been soliciting funds for the rebels
abroad.
   Sison founded the Maoist party in 1968 and was arrested in 1977.
He was among about 500 political prisoners released by Mrs. Aquino
in March 1986, one month after a civilian-military uprising toppled
Ferdinand Marcos and propelled her to power.
   The party and its armed wing, the New People's Army, have been
waging a 19-year insurgency to establish a Marxist state in the
Philippines.
   Elsewhere, the military said suspected rebels led by a fugitive
Roman Catholic priest ambushed a government jeep in the southern
Philippines, killing five people.
   Col. Rogelio Villanueva, regional army commander, said the
attack occurred Friday in the coastal town of Cortes in Surigao del
Sur province about 510 miles southeast of Manila.
   Villanueva said about 30 guerrillas opened fire on the National
Irrigation Administration jeep as it passed by on an isolated strip
of the national highway.
   Villanueva quoted the survivors as saying the rebel band was led
by renegade priest Frank Navarro, one of the best known clerics who
have joined the rebellion.

<HEAD>Bush Made Rapid Rise From Campaign Underdog</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush has dropped a line from his stock
campaign speech: the one about being the underdog and liking it.
   Little more than a month ago, the vice president was trailing
Democrat Michael Dukakis in national public opinion polls by double
digits. Now, most polls show Bush has seized the agenda and is
either leading Dukakis or is even with him.
   Political professionals offer differing explanations for Bush's
rapid rise. But most suggest a combination of factors: his
well-received convention address, a series of speeches that put
Dukakis on the defensive, and the failure of questions over running
mate Dan Quayle's military record to stick as a major liability.
   Some analysts also cite quick damage control on the part of
Bush's campaign team, led by campaign chairman James A. Baker III,
in minimizing possible embarrassments _ such as the quick
resignations last week of Bush operative Frederic Malek and six
members of an ethnic coalition after allegations of anti-Semitic
activities surfaced.
   Bush himself says he's doing a better job now in ``getting
through to the American people,'' both in terms of personality and
message and that ``there's a good sense the campaign is on the
move.''
   The speed of the vice president's rally was welcomed by campaign
officials.
   ``All of us had a lot of confidence in him and a lot of
confidence the campaign would start moving in the right direction.
But all of us were surprised how fast it did,'' campaign manager
Lee Atwater said.
   Atwater credits Bush's convention acceptance speech _ in which
he appealed for a ``kinder, gentler nation'' and moved out from the
shadow of President Reagan _ as decisive in Bush's surge.
   Private analysts agree the speech was important but suggest
other factors for Bush's rise, including a major miscalculation on
the part of Dukakis strategists on the impact of the Quayle
controversy.
   ``There is an old political axiom: never murder anyone when
they're committing suicide,'' said Norman Ornstein, a political
analyst with the American Enterprise Institute. ``There was a
tactical judgment in the Dukakis campaign to lay low for a few
weeks or play presidential.''
   ``But that didn't work very well,'' since the Quayle episode
``hasn't done the damage to George Bush that one might have
imagined,'' Ornstein said. ``Then, they (Dukakis campaign) were
flat-footed when Bush went aggressively on attack.''
   Quayle aside, Bush roared out of New Orleans with a series of
speeches that depicted Dukakis as a liberal who is soft on crime
and quick to raise taxes. The Dukakis campaign did little to
respond.
   Some Republicans said the furor over reports that Quayle used
family influence to join the Indiana National Guard during the
Vietnam War era may have actually worked to the ticket's advantage.
   Republican consultant David Carmen said, ``People were very
sympathetic to Quayle and didn't understand what all the fuss was.
They were getting no news about Dukakis and there was a lot of
sympathy for this guy.''
   Democratic consultant David Garth disagreed and said the
selection of Quayle ``was without doubt the dumbest move the Bush
campaign has made. It was dumb to pick him and dumb to stick with
him.''
   ``My feeling is that, had Bush picked anybody else but Quayle,
the election would be over today'' _ with Dukakis the loser, Garth
said.
   He said Bush's rise in the polls reflected ``a very good speech
at the convention'' and what he contended were misleading polls
that showed Dukakis ahead of Bush earlier in the summer.
   Dukakis appeared to be ahead only because of ``a false bump'' he
got from public attention to his lengthy primary battle against
Jesse Jackson. ``Then the only question left was whether Jackson
would cause trouble at the Democratic convention. And when he
didn't, it gave another spurt to Dukakis,'' Garth said.
   Other analysts suggested that Dukakis' lack of movement in the
polls reflects a common political phenomenon, a problem that in
fact affected Bush in his 1980 presidential bid: A relatively
unknown candidate gets a big surge in the polls from winning
primaries, then sees it evaporate as voters get to know more about
the candidate and lose their initial curiosity.

<HEAD>McFarlane Says Administration Exaggerated Potential Of Defenses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert ``Bud'' McFarlane, who was White House
national security adviser in 1983 when President Reagan launched
the Star Wars initiative, says the administration engaged in
``romantic and hyperbolic hyperbole'' to exaggerate the potential
of space-based defenses.
   ``Truly impressive gains have been made in the technologies
associated with ballistic missile defense since the late 1960s,''
McFarlane wrote in the fall issue of Foreign Affairs magazine.
   ``Yet there is no basis for saying that any of these systems
will be adaptable as effective weapons systems before the turn of
the century, except for two traditional ground-based
interceptors,`` said McFarlane, who was Reagan's national security
adviser 1983-85.
   McFarlane said that he was among the White House advisers who
urged Reagan to outline the Star Wars plan, formally known as the
Strategic Defense Initiative, during a March 1983 speech on defense
issues.
   ``The president's speech provoked a firestorm of debate, and in
the five years since then have been marked by bitter, passionate
advocacy and criticism,'' he said.
   Initially, McFarlane said, the debate was ``polarized by, on the
one hand, the romantic and manipulative hyperbole of the
administration and, on the other, by the flatly dismissive rhetoric
of scientists who should have known better.''
   In answer to the question, ``can defensive technologies provide
the means to defend us against ballistic missile attack?'' said
McFarlane, ``we do not know and cannot know for the next 10 to 15
years.''
   Despite the sometimes misguided political debate that followed
Reagan's Star Wars speech in 1983, said McFarlane, the initiative
helped force the Soviets back to the negotiating table, nudged them
toward 50 percent cuts in strategic arms and may have prompted them
to into economic reforms.
   McFarlane wrote that ``those of us in the White House who
proposed the Strategic Defense Initiative believe that a
reorientation of our investment strategy to emphasize an area of
our comparative advantage _ excellence in high technology _ could
persuade the Soviets that we could outstrip an entire generation of
Soviet military investment.''
   ``If we could do so, we could remove their only claim to
superpower status and perhaps lead them to deal more constructively
with our concerns about their (strategic rocket) forces,'' he said.
   ``The Soviets' commitment to a 50-percent reduction in their
heavy missile launchers and warheads _ a possibility they would not
discuss seriously until after SDI was proposed _ represents a
vindication of that strategy,'' wrote McFarlane.
   McFarlane, a former Marine Corps officer, resigned from the
National Security Council staff in December 1985 and is now a
counselor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in
Washington.
   He pleaded guilty in March to four counts of misleading Congress
about the Iran-Contra affair, in which the administration sent arms
to Iran in hopes of winning freedom for American hostages in
Lebanon.

   Troops opened fire on anti-government
protesters who surrounded the Ministry of Trade today but later
surrendered to the students and Buddhist monks who occupied the
downtown building, witnesses said.
   After the soldiers surrendered, they were disguised as
protesters so they could escape, witnesses said. Elsewhere, three
people accused of offering poisoned water to demonstrators two
weeks ago were beaten to death by a mob and beheaded after the
monks released them from their custody, witnesses said.
   Three people were slightly wounded in the shooting at the
ministry, the witnesses said, the first known by troops in Rangoon
against anti-government protestors since a bloody but ineffective
military crackdown last month.
   The incident at the ministry occurred while as many as half a
million students, striking government employees, monks and
policemen took to the streets to demand the end to 26 years of
authoritarian rule.
   Two other government buildings nearby, City Hall and the Central
Bank, were ringed by demonstrators but there was apparently no
bloodshed although some reported hearing shots fired. About 100
soldiers stood guard at each building.
   A small number of soldiers guarding the Trade Ministry opened
fire on a surging crowd which surrounded the building and
threatened to set it afire.
   Clambering over adjacent rooftops, students entered the top
floor of the four-story structure. According to eyewitness
accounts, 24 soldiers inside the building surrendered to monks and
were disguised as students wearing red headbands to get them past
the mob outside.
   The soldiers were driven away, possibly to a nearby monastery,
and the monks seized one machine gun and several semi-automatic
weapons.
   Today was not the first time soldiers sided with the
demonstrators. On Sept. 9, 500 servicemen marched with protesters
in Rangoon in the first major military defection. Smaller
defections also occurred in the provinces.
   
   Three people alleged to have offered poisoned water to
demonstrators two weeks ago were beaten to death by a mob and
beheaded after being released from the custody of monks, witnesses
said.
   Some opposition leaders, who are believed to be negotiating with
President Maung Maung's government, were attempting to stop mob
violence from escalating. On Friday, one key opposition figure,
Aung Gyi, defused a potentially bloody confrontation between
soldiers and demonstrators moving on the Ministry of Defense armed
with spears, swords and knives.
   ``They don't seem to be afraid of the guns. They are angry and
frustrated,'' said one Burmese intellectual watching the
demonstrators facing off against rifle-armed troops Friday.
   The renewed protests indicated the general Rangoon population
was unsatisfied with the reforms offered by the government.
   The state-owned Radio Rangoon announced Friday that all military
personnel and civil servants had to resign from the ruling Burma
Socialist Program Party and refrain from membership in all future
political parties.
   The decision, the radio said, was made at the recommendation of
a recently formed election commission which is to suprevise
multiparty elections in about three months. The opposition has
rejected this move, saying an interim government must be formed
before elections can take place.
   About two-thirds of the 2.5 million members of the Burma
Socialist Program Party come from military and civil service ranks.
   Several Burmese government employees said today they would defy
a government order that they return to work by Sept. 26 or face
dismissal.
   Virtually all government employees, including some police and
military personnel, have been on strike since Aug. 8.
   Earlier today, the demonstrators marched in well-disciplined,
peaceful lines and carried placards with anti-government slogans
such as, ``If we don't get it (democracy), we will hit out.''
   When smaller numbers of protesters confronted troops at the
three government buildings, messages were quickly sent out and
shortly the demonstrators were reinforced by others from nearby
areas.
   Massive protests began after authoritarian leader Ne Win, who
seized power in 1962, resigned in July. His replacement, hardliner
Sein Lwin, attempted to restore calm by ordering the military to
fire on protesters, but he resigned 17 days later. On Aug. 19, the
relatively moderate Maung Maung became Burma's first civilian
leader in a quarter-century.

   Israeli troops killed one Palestinian and
wounded 24 in the occupied lands today, Arab sources said, as
residents observed a general strike to mark a massacre of
Palestinians in Lebanon six years ago.
   Today also was the 10th anniversary of the signing of the Camp
David accords which called for Palestinian self-rule in the
occupied lands and paved the way for the Israeli-Egyptian peace
treaty of March 1979.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir issued a statement on the accords
saying:
   ``These agreements created a turning point in the history of the
Middle East. They proved that it's possible to achieve peace
between Israel and its neighbors, that the hatred which prevailed
is not eternal.''
   Egypt marked the anniversary by once again blaming ``Israeli
intransigence'' for the accords' failure to give the Palestinians
in the occupied lands a voice in ruling themselves.
   But except for the bitterly worded statement by Butros Ghali,
minister of state for foreign affairs, the anniversary passed
largely unnoticed in Cairo.
   Underground leaders of the Palestinian uprising called for the
general strike to mark the massacre of hundreds of Palestinians in
Beirut's Sabra and Chatilla refugee camps by Israeli-backed
Christian militiamen in September 1982. The strike turned violent
in several towns and villages.
   In Jenin, dozens of Palestinians blocked the road with stones
and burning tires and threw rocks at passing military vehicles, an
Arab reporter said.
   Troops opened fire with rubber bullets and tear gas. When the
rioters failed to disperse, the soldiers opened fire with real
bullets, killing 18-year-old Emad Arkawi. A military spokesman
confirmed a dead Palestinian was brought to the hospital but said
the army was investigating the circumstances.
   Arkawi was the 267th Palestinian to die since the intefadeh,
Arabic for uprising, began nine months ago. Six Israelis have also
been killed.
   Arab reporters said three Palestinians between the ages of 17
and 20, including one woman, were wounded in the incident.
   Another 21 Palestinians were wounded, at least one critically,
in clashes with troops in other parts of the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   The army said it was investigating the reports.
   The general strike was fully observed throughout the occupied
territories.
   In Jenin, Palestinians painted graffiti in Arabic and Hebrew
saying: ``Death to the Jews,'' and ``The End Is Near.'' It was the
first time Arab insurgents have painted graffiti in Hebrew.
Palestinian flags, outlawed by Israel, flew from the homes of many
Jenin residents.
   In all the cities of the occupied territories, workers stayed
away from their jobs, transportation ground to a halt and the
streets were deserted.
   In Gaza City, Palestinian flags were hoisted on electricity
wires and protesters burned tires. Protesters littered the highway
linking Gaza and Khan Yunis with nails to prevent cars from
travelling.

   The Organization of American States, facing
the worst financial crisis of its history, may be forced to lay off
as many as 300 of its 1,000 employees over the next few months,
according to OAS sources.
   The crisis is based largely on the Reagan administration's
decision to reduce its 1988 contribution to the OAS by $10 million
and by the same amount next year. Compounding the problem is the
failure of several other major contributors, including Chile and
Venezuela, to keep their payments current, the sources said.
   The impending layoffs have generated gloom and uncertainty among
OAS employees, most of whom are Latin Americans who are faced with
the prospect of the immediate loss of their U.S. visas if their
jobs are eliminated.
   ``The staff is terribly worried,'' said Arturo Garzon, a Mexican
who is president of the OAS staff association.
   He noted that many of the employees are longtime residents of
the Washington area and would have to start from scratch if forced
to return with their families to their native lands.
   ``They are facing a terrible family situation,'' Garzon said.
   The OAS, whose origins date back 99 years, is designed to
enhance cooperation among the United States and more than 30 other
countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.
   In its heyday, the OAS was seen by successive U.S.
administrations as a vital tool for combatting communism in the
hemisphere but the United States has largely ignored the
organization in recent years. This is partly because the
anti-communist consensus among member states has eroded over the
years.
   President Reagan bypassed the OAS in October 1983 when he
decided to join forces with several other Caribbean countries in
toppling the leftist government of Grenada.
   Neither the United States nor Nicaragua has looked to the OAS as
an appropriate forum for achieving a settlement to their
long-running dispute.
   The United States, with 85 per cent of the combined gross
national product of OAS member states, has a quota of about $40
million, or 66 per cent of the organization's annual budget of
about $65 million.
   The money is used to pay for programs in such fields as human
rights, education and drug abuse, among others.
   But the Reagan administration, faced with its own budgetary
woes, informed the OAS last May that it was reneging on $10 million
of its 1988 quota. The money was reallocated to cover a foreign
exchange shortfall that U.S. diplomatic missions in Europe had
experienced as a result of the declining value of the dollar.
   The OAS sources said the second blow came more recently when the
United States decided to cut $10 million from its 1989 quota.
   ``We have to decide every month which bills we'll pay,'' said
one OAS official, insisting on anonymity. He predicted the layoffs
would be announced around January 1 after decisions are made on
which programs should receive priority.
   Joao Baena Soares, a Brazilian who has served as OAS secretary
general since 1984, was unavailable for comment on the crisis. But
he told one interviewer recently that the situation ``is so serious
the essence of the organization is in danger.''
   Said Garzon, ``We have dedicated our lives to the benefit of the
hemisphere. But we are disposable.''

<TEXT>
   Tourists are flying out and medicine,
plastic tents and food are pouring in at Jamaica's two
international airports as this island nation struggles to recover
from the fury of Hurricane Gilbert.
   Little by little, Jamaica, home to 2.3 million people, is
struggling back from the worst disaster in its history. But it's
going to be a slow and painful process.
   The confirmed death toll of 26 was low in comparison with
Hurricane Charlie, which hit Jamaica in 1951 and killed more than
150 people. But Charlie caused less physical damage. Prime Minister
Edward Seaga has estimated losses at $8 billion and called Gilbert
the worst disaster in the nation's history.
   The government say 500,000 people, or two-fifths of the
population, have been left homeless after the hurricane roared down
the spine of the 144-mile-long island on Monday. Four out of every
five houses were either damaged or destroyed as Gilbert's 145 mph
winds tore away zinc roofs as if they were plastic sheets.
   Ninety-three percent of the island still had no electricity
Saturday, although power was restored in the northern coast city of
Montego Bay, the main tourist area.
   The power failure cut off fresh water supplies to most of the
island, including Kingston, a city of 750,000 people, because the
pumping and filtration plants run on electricity. Power was not
expected to be fully restored to the capital for at least two weeks.
   Crowds gathered around water hydrants and burst mains in
90-degree heat, filling plastic buckets and old milk containers.
Reports from the countryside said people were taking water from
muddy streams, despite the hazard of contamination.
   Radio stations carried a taped message every half hour from the
health minister, Dr. Kenneth Baugh, warning people to boil drinking
water, and millions of water purification tablets were being
airlifted in from around the world.
   Looting of stores, warehouses and supermarkets in the first days
after the hurricane forced the government to impose a night curfew,
which was still in effect at the end of the week. People who failed
to stock up before the storm rushed supermarkets and gasoline
stations, forming long lines outside both. Armed soldiers were seen
regulating the flow of shoppers in and out of a supermarket outside
Kingston.
   On Thursday, Seaga declared a 30-day state of public emergency,
ordering stores and gasoline stations to reopen and giving security
forces ``full'' but unspecified power to ensure that they did.
   The emergency order also gave the government the right to seize
transportation and heavy equipment to distribute supplies arriving
from around the world.
   The loss to agriculture is severe. Government officials said the
poultry industry and this years's crop of bananas and coffee were
wiped out.
   Seaga told reporters Friday that he would discuss the disaster
with world bank officials next week, but had no plan to ask for a
rescheduling of Jamaica's $4 billion foreign debt.
   The disaster hit just as Jamaica was showing signs of recovery
from economic distress brought on by a worldwide slump in the value
of bauxite, sugar and other commodities.
   In addition, tourism _ now the nation's biggest foreign exchange
earner at $550 million a year _ had staged a remarkable recovery as
a result of an intense campaign to rid the island of its reputation
for political violence.
   Although four major hotels in Montego Bay were heavily damaged,
Seaga said the area was making a quick recovery and the tourist
industry was generally in good shape.
   Elections are due in Jamaica by next March, and Seaga, who is
seeking a second consecutive term, has consistently trailed former
Prime Minister Michael Manley in opinion polls. There was
speculation that his handling of the hurricane disaster could tip
the balance.

   A $100,000 reward is on the table and
nearly $1 million has been paid in ransom, but authorities say they
still haven't gotten a break in the kidnapping of the ailing wife
of a Jackson multimillionaire.
   Earlier this month, FBI officials released a statement by Robert
M. Hearin offering the reward and asking for the safe return of his
wife, 72-year-old Annie Laurie Hearin, who was abducted from their
home July 26.
   Mrs. Hearin suffers from intestinal ileitis, a disease that can
result in life-threatening complications without medication.
   ``Nothing is new,'' said Police Department spokesman Sgt. Chip
Pippen. ``To my knowledge, at least in the police department, we've
had no response to the reward.''
   FBI agent Wayne Taylor said federal authorities had nothing new
to report.
   ``The investigation is ongoing at this time,'' he said. ``The
community is concerned, but we just have nothing to report.''
   Since Mrs. Hearin's disappearance, the only word from her has
been a letter, which the FBI said was in her handwriting, with an
Atlanta postmark.
   Hearin could not be reached for comment; calls to his home were
not answered.
   A typed ransom note was left at the house when Mrs. Hearin was
abducted. Small spots of blood were found inside and outside the
front door of the two-story house.
   The crudely phrased note, the only direct word from the
kidnappers, instructed Hearin to pay an unspecified amount of money
to 12 people he had allegedly wronged.
   The people named in the letter are current or former franchisers
with School Pictures of Mississippi Inc., which handles portraits
of school children, of which Hearin was once the largest
stockholder. The company filed suit against the 12 in the early
1980s, claiming they owed money from operating loans, materials and
film processing fees.
   Hearin researched the monetary amounts involved in the lawsuits
to decide how much to pay each of the 12. Although neither the FBI
nor Hearin has said exactly how much was paid, the payments
``totaled nearly one million dollars,'' according to Hearin's Aug.
23 statement.
   The story of the kidnapping was voluntarily embargoed by the
news media for about 30 hours because officials believed publicity
might endanger the victim. The kidnapping was disclosed at a news
conference July 28 after family members decided to go public
because of the vagueness of the demands in the ransom note.
   On Aug. 23, FBI officials announced that Hearin had followed the
instructions and that payment had been mailed to the 12 named in
the letter, or their survivors, on Aug. 16, the day after Hearin
received the letter from his wife.
   The letter promised that Mrs. Hearin would be returned if the
payments were made.
   Taylor said he could not comment on whether any of the 12 people
had returned the money. At least one _ lawyer N. Alfred Winn of St.
Petersburg, Fla. _ reportedly did send back a check he received
from Hearin.
   Hearin's worth reportedly exceeds $100 million. In addition to
being co-owner of Mississippi Valley Gas Co., he and his partner,
New Jersey oil man Leon Hess, own controlling interest in Lamar
Life Corp., a life insurance company which is the largest
stockholder in Trustmark National Bank, Mississippi's
second-largest financial institution.
   Mark Dale, lead researcher for ``Unsolved Mysteries,'' NBC-TV's
series on unsolved crimes, said producers plan to broadcast a
segment about the kidnapping this fall if Mrs. Hearin is not found.
Last year, the segments produced tips that led to the capture of
nine fugitives and solving of eight cases.

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS grafs 26-27: Meanwhile, Handgun, to CORRECT Handgun
Control's position that law enforcement supported sted opposed

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Ken Gray says that in his southern
Illinois district, support for the National Rifle Association is
almost as strong as for the Pledge of Allegiance.
   So when the NRA told Gray's constituents to make sure he voted
against a waiting period for handgun purchases, they responded.
   A week ago, they surrounded his car in the district and
virtually kept him prisoner inside until he promised to help strip
the waiting period from an anti-drug bill.
   They repeated verbatim all the NRA arguments _ especially the
fear that this was the beginning of the end of gun ownership.
   Last Thursday, the Illinois Democrat was part of the 228-182
majority that voted to eliminate from an anti-drug bill a seven-day
waiting period for handgun purchases and an optional background
check of the buyer. The House substituted a requirement that the
Justice Department develop a system for gun dealers to check
whether buyers are convicted felons.
   Gray's case, more than almost any other, shows just how powerful
the tug of the NRA can be.
   He has no fear of defeat, because he's not running for
re-election due to health reasons.
   He said he personally supports a waiting period and believes his
constituents were ``brainwashed by the NRA.''
   And he had an emotional reason to support the waiting period,
since two of his longtime friends and former constituents are Jim
and Sarah Brady.
   The waiting period is symbolically named after Jim Brady, the
presidential press secretary who was shot along with President
Reagan in the March 30, 1981, attempt on Reagan's life. Sarah Brady
is the vice chair of Handgun Control Inc., which joined the
nation's major law enforcement organizations to lobby hard for the
waiting period.
   So why did Gray vote with the NRA?
   In his district, Gray said, ``after the Pledge of Allegiance,
the NRA comes next. If I'm their spokesman, I'm not going to pull a
holier than thou routine. I'm sitting here as a hired hand.''
   The tug of the NRA wasn't as direct on all House members, but it
was there nonetheless.
   Rep. Helen Delich Bentley, R-Md., is a strong-willed lawmaker
who would never be called a wimp by her colleagues. A co-sponsor of
the drug bill that contained the Brady language, she said she told
NRA backers ``I supported Brady and leave me alone.''
   Ms. Bentley said in an interview she was not pressured by the
NRA. But when the voting began, she watched the NRA supporters pile
up an increasing margin for their substitute language.
   When the pro-NRA count reached a majority, she decided she
couldn't be of help to the waiting-period forces. Bowing to the
inevitable, she inserted her electronic card into a slot that cast
her vote for the NRA's position.
   ``I wanted to see what would happen,'' she said. ``I told Sarah
Brady a long time ago I would support her amendment. But I made a
decision to vote depending on what was on the table. When I voted,
the Brady amendment was gone.''
   It was not the first time the 3-million-member NRA won a gun
control fight, though the opposition this time was more formidable.
   The opponents matched the NRA's zeal, but the gun control forces
could not match the NRA's financial resources, said Dewey Stokes,
the president of the Fraternal Order of Police.
   David Conover, an NRA lobbyist, attributed his group's victory
to hard work, good strategy and some last-minute luck.
   The gun group, as it has many times before, mobilized its 21
field representatives across the country and thousands of activist
volunteers.
   When the Brady language appeared ready for a vote two weeks ago,
the NRA count estimated only a narrow 10-vote victory.
   Then, the vote was postponed for a week.
   ``We got lucky,'' Conover said, because the postponement allowed
thousands of NRA members to receive their latest issue of either
American Hunter or American Rifleman _ the NRA magazines. Although
prepared in August, the publications contained an ad urging members
to call members of Congress to vote against the waiting period.
   ``People saw in the magazine it still was not resolved,''
Conover said, and apparently turned a steady stream of contacts
with lawmakers into a last-minute flood.
   Meanwhile, Handgun Control Inc., saying law enforcement
uniformly supported the waiting period, brought hundreds of
uniformed police officers to Washington as lobbyists.
   But months before, the NRA had begun compiling names of police
officers who backed the gun lobby's positions and opposed the
waiting period.
   Two weeks ago, the NRA brought its police backers to Washington,
and House members began receiving visits by rank-and-file officers
from both sides.
   The pro-Brady police officers were given space in a House office
building by the Judiciary Committee, whose chairman, Peter W.
Rodino Jr., D-N.J., supported their cause. They turned the hearing
room into a command center, directing the lobbying effort.
   The pro-NRA police had breakfast each morning at the NRA
cafeteria, and then were bused to Capitol Hill.
   ``When more than 100 rank-and-file police officers came to
Capitol Hill and, in their own words, argued against a waiting
period, that had a big effect,'' Conover said.
   ``It showed what we had been saying, but had not demonstrated:
that law enforcement was not united on this issue.''

   Hurricane Gilbert weakened to a
tropical storm as it blustered northwestward today but it threw
tornadoes and sheets of rain at thousands of shuttered evacuees
along the Texas-Mexico border.
   At least 109 people have been killed and more than 800,000 left
homeless since Gilbert ripped through the Caribbean with 175 mph
wind earlier this week, then crossed the Yucatan Peninsula and Gulf
of Mexico before slamming into northeastern Mexico. One person died
today in Texas after being injured in a tornado.
   But by this morning, the once massive storm's maximum sustained
winds had flagged to 65 mph, nine less than hurricane strength, and
forecasters said the eye had all but disappeared. However, they
warned of continued danger from flash flooding inland.
   Gilbert was downgraded to a tropical storm at 6 a.m. EDT as it
proceeded 50 miles southeast of the city of Monterrey in northern
Mexico, said Noel Rishnychok, a meteorologist with the National
Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
   Winds were still weakening as the storm moved west-northwest at
12 mph, he said.
   Gulf Coast residents expressed relief that the storm, which
earlier was deemed the most powerful ever tracked in the Western
Hemisphere, pulled its punch as it came ashore despite delivering a
spate of tornadoes.
   ``We're thankful,'' said Betty Turner, mayor of Corpus Christi.
``What could have been one of the most deadly storms in history
appears to have missed us.''
   Corpus Christi residents who evacuated were eager to return, but
Turner said, ``We're saying don't do it because of the flooding.''
   At least a dozen tornadoes peppered southern Texas today,
following 14 on Friday, killing one woman, striking a hospital
complex, military bases and a mobile home park, authorities said.
Some injuries were reported.
   At 6 a.m. CDT, the center of the storm was in northern Mexico
near latitude 25.0 degrees north and longitude 99.8 west, or about
150 miles southwest of Brownsville, located at the southernmost tip
of Texas.
   Gilbert's remnants should bring very heavy rains to Rio Grande
valley before heading north up the Mississippi River Valley as a
``huge rain-making machine,'' said Mark Zimmer, meteorologist at
the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
   ``The danger of flash flooding in Texas is very great,'' Zimmer
said. ``Rainfall as high as 10 to 15 inches _ maybe even 20 inches
_ is expected.''
   By midweek, the storm should be in the lower Ohio River Valley
and end up in the Great Lakes as nothing more than foul weather,
forecasters said.
   ``The people in the Midwest better dust off their umbrellas,''
Zimmer said.
   Gilbert, responsible for billions of dollars in damage during a
weeklong rampage across the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, barreled
ashore Friday afternoon in Tamaulipas state, a sparsely populated
area of Mexico about 120 miles south of Brownsville.
   The eye passed over Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz, two small
villages a few miles north of La Pesca, Mexico, where ocean tides
coursed over two miles of flatlands and into the town.
   ``We presume (the Mexican villages) are getting a good pounding
from 120 mph winds,'' Zimmer said Friday.
   Thousands of people evacuated in areas of northeastern Mexico,
including the entire beach area of Matamoros, a city of 280,000
just across the border.
   To the south, about 300,000 people were homeless in Yucatan
state and 10,000 more were homeless in Campeche, on the west coast
of the peninsula, the government news agency Notimex said. The
storm had left more than 500,000 homeless in Jamaica earlier in the
week.
   In Texas, heavy rains fell on Brownsville, with gusts up to 82
mph recorded at nearby Padre Island, but the vulnerable coastal
area escaped the worst of the storm.
   Police in nearby Harlingen said the windows of 20 to 30 cars in
a parking lot were shattered by high winds or a tornado. Low-lying
coastal roads were closed by high water.
   About 125 shelters holding 50,000 people were open in a
four-county area of southern Texas around Brownsville, said
American Red Cross spokeswoman Barbara Lohman. When the eye of the
storm passed to the south, evacuees were eager to return to their
homes.
   ``We're going home. We think everything is going to be OK,''
Philip Gibbons said Friday night, leaving a Brownsville shelter
into a downpour. ``We don't think it's going to get bad and there
was no need to stay here anymore.''
   Others, however, were more cautious.
   ``I wouldn't want to go home and then have my family hurt by a
tornado,'' said Praxedis Lindsey, 25, of Brownsville, who was at a
shelter with his pregnant wife and son.
   Elsewhere, most of the estimated 25,000 people evacuated in
southern Louisiana and 20,000 in the island city of Galveston were
allowed to return home Friday.
   In Alabama, tornadoes were reported in seven counties, uprooting
trees but causing no major damage or injuries.
   One Texas drowning was indirectly related to the hurricane. A
3-year-old boy fell from his family's shrimp boat when they moved
the vessel for safe mooring, officials said.

   Rains from Hurricane Gilbert sent a
river raging over its banks in Monterrey, sweeping at least 10
policemen to their deaths and overturning buses loaded with
evacuees from Matamoros, police said today.
   The flooding occurred in Monterrey, an industrial city of 3
million people, located 110 miles from the Texas border and 140
miles inland from Matamoros.
   At least 10 police officers were swept away while on a rescue
mission around midnight, a judicial police officer said. Several
buses loaded with evacuees overturned in the raging water and more
were feared drowned.
   The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said early
today it had been raining for more than 24 hours.
   A trailer truck also slid into the Santa Catarina river in the
driving rain and its two occupants were missing, the local
newspaper El Norte said.
   Recreational areas with soccer fields, basketball courts, tennis
courts and jogging trails have been built along the river in the
last few years.
   Monterrey is a major northern industrial center and the capital
of Nuevo Leon state. The Santa Catarina river crosses Monterrey.
   The storm slammed into Mexico for the second time in a week
Friday afternoon. The eye of 450-mile-wide hurricane, with 120 mph
winds, crossed onto land at 5:35 p.m. EDT, sweeping ashore in a
sparsely populated area 120 miles south of Brownsville, Texas,
weather reports said.
   Although the storm had lost much of its muscle, it caused floods
and mudslides after it barreled into Mexico. Earlier in the week,
Gilbert killed at least 29 and left 300,000 people homeless in the
Yucatan Peninsula.
   The hurricane has killed at least 109 people, including one in
Texas, 39 in Mexico, 26 in Jamaica, 30 in Haiti, five in the
Dominican Republic and eight in Honduras. However, the death toll
is expected to rise.
   In Matamoros just across the Rio Grande from Brownsville, the
storm felled trees, downed power lines and flattened dozens of tin
shack homes on the evacuated beachfront. About 5,000 people were
evacuated inland.
   Nearly two dozen tornadoes were reported around Brownsville.
Much of the Yucatan Peninsula remained without communications and
supplies today.
   At 9 a.m. EDT today, Gilbert's center was located near latitude
25.1 north and longitude 100.3 west, or 185 miles west southwest of
Brownsville and 40 miles south of Monterrey, said the National
Hurricane Center in Florida.
   Maximum sustained winds were estimated to be near 50 mph and the
storm was expected to weaken further during the next 24 hours.
   The center said rainfall of 10 to 15 inches was accompanying the
storm with up to 20 inches locally. Flash floods were likely, it
said.
   The storm was moving west-northwest at about 12 mph, and was
expected to follow that track through midday today before turning
gradually to the northwest, forecasters said.
   In Matamoros, officials said the worst part of the storm
appeared to have passed. ``Up to now the damages are not considered
very grave,'' said Jose Inez Gonzalez, a Matamoros government
spokesman.
   Officials distributed crackers and water to thousands of people
in shelters and rged them to stay put until the storm ended.
   Gilbert hit Soto la Marina, a town of 8,000 people 20 miles
inland from La Pesca on late Friday, its mayor told The Associated
Press by telephone.
   ``There is considerable material damage to the town. It is still
raining very hard,'' said Mayor Ruben Hinojosa Cortina. ``We will
just have to stay in and wait until tomorrow to survey the
situation.''
   Hinojosa Cortina said about 3,000 refugees from La Pesca were
sheltered in Soto la Marina but other coastal residents had not
been evacuated or decided to ride out the storm.
   The Sierra de Tamaulipas, a small mountain range between
Monterrey and the coast, should blunt the hurricane's strength,
said Mark Zimmer, a meterologist at the National Hurricane Center.
   Zimmer expected the last of hurricane-force winds today. But he
predicted very heavy rains as warm hurricane winds rise into cooler
mountain air, possibly causing flash floods and mudslides.
   The Mexican armed forces began emergency flights Friday of food,
medicines and water to Cancun, Cozumel and other disaster sites in
the Yucatan.
   In many locations, hurricane victims were without food, drinking
water, electrical power, gasoline and communications since
Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   The newly renovated boyhood home of President
William H. Taft opened to the public Saturday and the federal
official who oversaw the completion of the 19-year project was
delighted.
   ``I'm very excited. I feel like we've really done something
important,'' said Steven Kesselman, National Park Service
superintendent for the house. ``It looks great, if I do say so
myself.''
   The 18-room, three-story house includes five furnished rooms,
exhibition rooms and work space for Park Service staff.
   Taft, the only American to serve as both president and U.S.
chief justice, was born at the house in 1857. His father, Alphonso
Taft, bought the house and its 1.82 acres for $10,000 in 1851,
after moving from New England, and added a wing for more space. The
family sold the house in 1899 and auctioned off many of the
furnishings.
   Park Service officials had no original blueprints to guide the
restoration. They had only an 1868 photograph of the house, with
young William Taft in the front yard, to show the home's 19th
century appearance.
   Taft, a lawyer who made his national reputation by serving as
civil governor of the Philippines and later as secretary of war
under President Theodore Roosevelt, was the nation's 27th
president, from 1909 to 1913.
   Taft lost a re-election bid to Woodrow Wilson and served as
chief justice from 1921 to 1930. He died in Washington in March
1930, a few weeks after resigning from the Supreme Court.
   The house, built in the 1840s, was acquired by the Park Service
in 1969. Kesselman, who arrived in 1985 to direct the final stages
of restoration, said the total job cost $3 million of public and
private funds.
   The private Friends of William Howard Taft Birthplace Inc.
raised nearly $600,000 of that total to buy furniture. Some
furniture was donated.

   The destructive force of Hurricane Gilbert
has put this Caribbean resort, popular with U.S. and other
tourists, out of commission for up to three months, Cancun's mayor
said.
   Nearly 6,000 tourists were stranded in the resort area Friday
and 2,000 other vacationers were in the neighboring resort island
of Cozumel, just south of Cancun.
   With Cancun still without electricity or telephone service after
Gilbert hit Wednesday, the tourist industry's priority today was
``to get the tourists out of here,''said Gabriel Escalante,
president of the Cancun Hotel Association.
   Mayor Jose Gonzalez Zapata said Cancun's luxury beachfront
hotels, many flooded and windowless, ``should be operating by
December.'' The tourist high season starts on Dec. 15.
   Tourism Minister Antonio Enriquez Savignac was more optimistic,
saying that damages to Cancun's hotels would be repaired within six
weeks.
   Escalante said it was too early to estimate financial losses
suffered by Cancun's tourist industry when Gilbert slammed into the
city with 160 mph winds. At least 39 people died in Mexico in the
storm, which forecasters have called the most intense on record.
   He said a figure would have to wait ``until experts come in to
evaluate the damage.''
   About 1,500 tourists jammed the local airport Friday afternoon
waiting for a flight out.
   Eleven commercial flights left Cancun Friday from an airport
working only during daylight hours because its control tower
suffered serious damages. Temporary controller equipment was being
shipped in from Mexico City.
   Among the most seriously damaged of the nearly 50 beachfront
hotels were the Club Med and the Presidente.
   Craig Rowley, a Club Med employee from Whittier, Calif., said
about half the luxury resort's installations were destroyed by the
hurricane.

<HEAD>Trustee Says Two New PTL Bidders; Ministry Trims Services,
Expenses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT MILL, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PTL's bankruptcy trustee says he is
considering two new bids for the ministry's assets this weekend as
he prepares to recommend a buyer to a federal bankruptcy judge.
   ``I hope we can finish it up by Monday,'' Trustee M.C. ``Red''
Benton said Friday night.
   In a separate development, ministry officials said they were
suspending some service programs at the troubled ministry,
including a home for unwed mothers-to-be, to save money.
   Benton said one new bidder is a Toronto, Ontario, businessman,
but he refused to reveal his name. Another bid came from a group of
private investors from the New York and Washington areas, Benton
said.
   The Charlotte (N.C.) Observer quoted unidentified sources as
saying the private investors offered about $200 million, $50
million in cash.
   The Canadian man, the newspaper reported, wants an option on the
assets until Dec. 31. If he then bought the property, he would pay
$115 million including $50 million in cash.
   Benton said if he could not make a recommendation on a buyer to
Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds by Monday, he would request another
deadline extension to accept more bids. Reynolds has given Benton
until Sept. 27 to choose a buyer or liquidate PTL's assets.
   Peter Thomas, the Vancouver, British Columbia, businessman who
had previously offered $113 million, remains a possible buyer,
Benton said, adding, ``I think Peter Thomas is still right in
there.''
   PTL has been in bankruptcy proceedings since June 1987, three
months after founder Jim Bakker left amid a sex-and-money scandal.
Reynolds has said that if PTL and its large Christian theme park
near here aren't sold by Oct. 1, he will order the ministry closed.
   Earlier this month, Benton described Bakker as the leading
bidder for the property, but the proposed deal apparently fell
through when Bakker couldn't prove he had the financing to reclaim
his ministry.
   Benton and Don Edwards, interim president of Heritage Ministries
Inc., said Heritage Ministries officials have suspended the
operations of their home for unwed mothers, adoption service and
home for homeless or drug-addicted men.
   The suspension will save the ministry $3,000 a day in operating
costs, said Edwards. The minstry had found homes for the two girls
still living at the unwed mothers facility and were looking for
places to send the men.

   A car slammed into a line of people waiting to buy
tickets to a concert by rock star Prince early Saturday, killing a
17-year-old and injuring five other people, police said.
   The driver of the car, a 21-year-old Cambridge man, told police
he was rear-ended by another vehicle, but police said they would
charge the man Monday with vehicular homicide, running a red light
and driving to endanger.
   ``They were on line and at about 1:45 a.m., this individual lost
control of his car,'' said Boston police spokesman Jim Jordan. He
said the car crossed a median and crashed into a line of people
waiting to buy tickets at a record store.
   Jordan said the 17-year-old, whose name was withheld pending
notification of relatives, was pronounced dead at Beth Israel
Hospital. Five other people were taken to two other hospitals, he
said.
   The 21-year-old driver was released. Although some witnesses
corroborated the driver's story of being hit, police believed the
man's actions contributed to the accident, Jordan said. However, he
said, there was no evidence of alcohol use.
   Tower Records receptionist Bobby Harris said ticket buyers had
started lining up Friday morning. The tickets for the Oct. 5
concert at the Worcester Centrum went on sale Saturday morning.
   Massachusetts General Hospital said three people taken there
were all treated and released, while officials at Brigham and
Women's Hospital said they would not immediately release
information on the condition of two ticket-buyers brought there.

<HEAD>Soviet Press In Rare Critique Of Polish Leadership</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Poland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Polish leadership must share the blame with
strikers and protesters for many of Poland's problems, the
state-run Soviet press said in a rare critique of a Moscow ally.
   The daily newspapers Izvestia and Sovietskaya Rossiya suggested
in commentaries Friday that Polish workers were driven to strike by
the government's mishandling of sharp price increases in the spring.
   Trust in Poland's government has eroded so badly that the
leadership may not survive, Sovietskaya Rossiya said.
   ``Will the incumbent government stay in power or will it resign?
This issue has become a political reality and will be discussed by
the Polish parliament,'' wrote V. Runov, Warsaw correspondent for
the official Tass news agency. His dispatch appeared in Sovietskaya
Rossiya.
   Izvestia said recent unrest should not cause the Polish
government to back away from reforms.
   ``The country has approached a point in the process of socialist
renovation and democratic development where it shouldn't stop.
Further steps forward are necessary to overcome dogmatic and
sketchy thinking,'' said correspondent L. Toporkov. ``One should
compromise, each to the other.''
   Sovietskaya Rossiya said the strikes and their aftermath are
just another step in democratization.
   ``But at the same time, economic decline is occurring. Progress
in reform over the last two or three years has been small and the
workers themselves have failed at reform,'' the newspaper said.
   When protests swept Poland earlier this year, the Soviet media
called the strikes ``groundless and harmful both from the political
and economic viewpoints.'' Commentaries carried by the papers then
also accused Western countries of agitating strikers.
   The latest wave of strikes in August posed the most serious
threat to Poland's government since it imposed martial law and
banned Solidarity in 1981. Lech Walesa, leader of the independent
union federation, agreed to end the strikes after the government
agreed to talks on legalizing the movement.
   ``On Aug. 20, when the strike wave reached its culmination
point, it was clearly determined that the workers' protest in major
cases is resistance to the failed economic policy conducted
recently,'' Sovietskaya Rossiya said.
   The Polish government this year raised prices 42 percent, a move
officials said was necessary to balance goods with the money
supply. Thousands of workers struck in protest and another wave of
strikes began in August.
   Sovietskaya Rossiya said Poland's council of ministers was given
extraordinary power to push through economic reforms, but ``it
hasn't given any tangible results.''
   Runov said the government has responded with immediate measures
to speed the country's economic reform program, but ``a problem of
trust in the government is still an open one.''

<HEAD>University Heart Transplant Surgeon Ousted As Division Head</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A world-renowned heart and lung transplant
surgeon has been ousted from his position as head of the division
of cardiovascular surgery at the University of Minnesota Hospital.
   Dr. Stuart Jamieson was relieved temporarily in early August
during an investigation into assorted allegations, among them a
never-proven claim that he or one of his assistants left a forceps
inside a patient's chest and then did not inform the patient of the
fact.
   In a brief news release offering no explanations, the hospital
said Friday that ``after considerable thought and external
consultation, a decision has now been made not to reinstate Dr.
Jamieson'' to his leadership post. It said he continues as a
professor of surgery and a member of the hospital staff.
   The August announcement came after the Star Tribune reported
that the university was investigating Jamieson in connection with
two operations. The newspaper later said its account of one of the
operations should not have been published because it was based on
sources who lacked firsthand knowledge.
   The St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch last month quoted sources as
saying the move for Jamieson, 40, to temporarily step aside was
partly the result of a sharp dispute over the surgeon's personality
and aggressive management style.
   The announcement Friday of surgery department chairman Dr. John
Najarian's decision not to reinstate Jamieson capped weeks of
tension at the hospital over the matter.
   Hospital spokeswoman Sally Howard said that because the decision
involves confidential personnel matters, the reasons for Jamieson's
ouster ``probably will never be discussed in a public forum.''
   There was no comment from Jamieson and Najarian; both have
failed to return repeated phone calls from reporters since the Aug.
2 announcement.
   Jamieson was hired by Najarian in January 1986 from Stanford
University Medical Center in Palo Alto, Calif., where he was a
protege of famed heart surgeon and University of Minnesota alumni
Dr. Norman Shumway. Shumway's daughter, a newly trained heart
surgeon, recently joined Jamieson's staff.
   ``I thought he was the best cardiac surgeon available in the
United States. He was our No. 1 choice,'' Najarian said in May
1986, soon after Jamieson's arrival.
   At the time, Jamieson was president-elect of the International
Society for Heart Transplantation. He is among a handful of
surgeons in the world trained in combined heart-lung transplants,
and has performed seven heart-lung transplants at Minnesota.
   There are two other heart transplant surgeons among the five
cardiac surgeons on the university staff, but Jamieson is the most
experienced and the only one who has done heart-lung and single-and
double-lung transplants.
   Dr. Edward Humphrey, chief of heart surgery at the Veterans
Administration Medical Center at Fort Snelling, will serve as
interim head of cardiovascular and thoracic surgery until a
permanent head is appointed, the statement said.
   University Vice President for Health Sciences Dr. Neal Vanselow
said he reviewed Najarian's action and supports it.
   ``These are tough and gray areas where anyone could make a
mistake, but I feel reasonably comfortable about this one,''
Vanselow said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British boxer Frank Bruno, the No. 1 contender to
Mike Tyson's heavyweight crown, shielded his family with his body
while the 200 mph winds of Hurricane Gilbert pounded Jamaica, a
newspaper reported Saturday.
   Nothing had been heard from the 26-year-old boxer, on vacation
in Jamaica with his girlfriend, Laura, and their daughters Nicola,
6, and Rachel, 2, since the hurricane struck the island last Monday.
   But on Saturday the London Daily Mail newspaper, which tracked
them to their hotel at the beachside resort of Negril, told how
Bruno had shielded his family with his 228-pound body while the
storm battered the holiday complex.
   ``It was worse than anything you can imagine,'' the Mail quoted
Bruno as saying. ``There was nothing to do but duck down, box
clever and pray and hope it would go away.
   ``Nothing can scare me now. Tyson will be a breeze after this
little lot,'' the boxer, whose title fight with the American has
been postponed twice, was quoted as saying.
   Bruno would not have been on vacation at all had his title fight
with Tyson, originally scheduled for Wembley Stadium Oct. 8, not
been delayed. The champion suffered a concussion in a car crash at
his New York state home two weeks ago and no new date has been
fixed.
   The Daily Mail said other guests at Bruno's hotel talked with
admiration of the fighter's efforts to protect his family and help
local villagers replace tin roofs on their shattered homes.
   They quoted West German engineer Frank Oesterle, vacationing at
the same hotel as Bruno, as saying: ``He is a big man in every way
with a big heart. He worked like a Trojan to help clear up the mess
and he was out among the guests cheering them up.
   ``He told me that during the height of the storm his family was
very frightened, crouching on the floor, and he used his big arms
and body to protect them,'' Oesterle told the Daily Mail.
   Bruno told the newspaper: ``Quite frankly we were all shocked.
We did not think it was going to be as serious as it was even
though we had a warning.''
   In London, Bruno's manager Terry Lawless, who spent four days
trying to contact the fighter, said, ``Thank God he's safe. I am
not surprised he's being dubbed a hero.''

   Anti-Marxist rebels of the Mozambique
National Resistance killed 46 soldiers from Mozambique and Zimbabwe
during clashes in the last month, the rebels claimed Saturday.
   The rebels released the statement in Lisbon one day after Pope
John Paul II arrived in Mozambique on the last part of a 10-day
tour of southern Africa. John Paul urged Mozambique's
Marxist-oriented leaders to begin peace talks with the rebels.
   In the statement, rebel movement leader Alfonso Dhlakama said he
hoped John Paul's visit would contribute to peace in Mozambique,
one of the world's poorest nations and one that has been wracked by
internal war since it gained independence from Portugal in 1975.
   On Monday, the rebels declared a cease-fire in three areas of
the country so residents could attend Masses celebrated by the pope.
   The rebel statement said its forces on Sept. 1 attacked barracks
housing Mozambique government troops and Zimbabwean forces, killing
nine Mozambican and seven Zimbabwean soldiers.
   The statement said rebel forces on Monday killed 20 Mozambique
government soldiers and nine Zimbabweans in clashes near Vila de
Mungari, southwest of the coastal city of Beira.
   The rebel forces disputed what they said were government claims
that rebel commander General Calisto Meque was killed in combat by
Mozambican troops in central Zambezia province.
   The statement said Meque is alive and commanding rebel units in
Zambezia. The rebels also claimed they killed a government officer
late last month in an ambush in northern Cabo Delgado province.
   The government forces _ backed by Zimbabwean, Tanzanian and
Malawian troops _ have been fighting the right-wing guerrillas in
Mozambique since 1975.
   The bitter struggle has forced 1 million Mozambicans to flee to
neighboring countries and caused famine among an estimated 6
million of the country's 14.5 million inhabitants.
   The rebel forces, whose estimated 12,000 to 22,000 guerrilla
fighters formerly received backing from South Africa, have been
accused of slaughtering civilians. The rebels deny the allegations.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan operated a secret chemical weapons factory
during World War II, bombed China with poison gas grenades and
tested poison on prisoners of war, including Americans, a new
report charges.
   The report in the October issue of the Chicago-based Bulletin of
the Atomic Scientists also contends the U.S. government knew about
Japan's use of chemical weapons but failed to prosecute Japanese
officers at the Tokyo war crimes tribunal in 1946.
   The report's author, Yuki Tanaka, speculated the U.S. government
decided against prosecuting because it wanted to learn from Japan's
knowledge of bacteriological warfare.
   ``The use of chemical weapons (by the Japanese) was covered up
by the U.S. government,'' Tanaka said Saturday in a telephone
interview from his home in Australia.
   Tanaka, a lecturer in Japanese at the University of Adelaide in
Australia, drew on newly discovered Japanese war documents, his own
interviews and previously published material to piece together the
account, said Len Ackland, the Bulletin's editor.
   ``I think what you have here is the first full story of Japan's
poison gas enterprise and its grim results both on the Chinese and
on the Japanese workers,'' he said Friday.
   Tanaka said his research was prompted partly by the Japanese
government's long-time insistence that it never used chemical
weapons in World War II. Japan signed the 1925 Geneva Convention
that banned use of such weapons.
   Tanaka said his research showed that Japan built a factory for
chemical weapons on Okunoshima, one of dozens of tiny islands in
the Inland Sea. To help keep the factory secret, Tanaka contends,
the Japanese government erased the island from maps in 1939.
   The factory operated from 1929 until the end of World War II,
when it was destroyed at the direction of Allied officers. The
plant manufactured a variety of chemicals, including mustard gas,
lewisite, nausea gas and hydrocyanic acid gas for use against
China, Tanaka's report said.
   Neither the Japanese nor U.S. governments would respond to the
report in the Bulletin, a monthly magazine founded in 1945 and
supported by scientists concerned about the implications of nuclear
weapons development.
   The Japanese foreign ministry would not make an official comment
despite repeated calls from The Associated Press. But a Ministry of
Education official said, ``We have not gathered enough evidence to
specify it as a historical event.''
   The U.S. Defense and State departments also declined comment on
the report through several public affairs officers, all of whom
refused to be identified.
   Atrocities committed during the Japanese invasion of China,
which began shortly before World War II, have long been a source of
controversy between the two countries. Chinese army records allege
that at least 2,000 Chinese were killed and 35,000 injured by
Japanese chemical weapons, Tanaka's report said.
   Tanaka wrote that in 1983, researchers from Keio University
obtained a two-volume report on Japan's experiments with
bacteriological and chemical weapons on Chinese, Soviet, American
and Polish prisoners in the early 1940s.
   The article gave no detail on the tests on Americans but said
Chinese were subjected to mustard gas attacks and it quoted
research notes on the resulting damage to their skin.
   In another test, Chinese prisoners had to drink a liquid form of
the chemical; in a third, some of the liquid was dropped in the eye
of a prisoner, Tanaka reported. Documents do not say what happened
to the prisoners.
   In his article, Tanaka contends that U.S. Col. Thomas Morrow, a
law officer assigned to investigate Japanese war crimes, uncovered
evidence of Japan's use of chemical weapons and wrote two reports
about it.
   But Tanaka said Morrow ``was summoned home abruptly'' from Tokyo
in the early stages of the war crimes trials, ``and the issue was
dropped, possibly because the U.S. government was interested in
keeping information relating to biological and chemical warfare for
its own use.''
   ``My intention was to warn of the danger of chemical weapons,''
Tanaka said. ``So I hope the U.S. and other major countries which
are producing chemical weapons will reconsider.''
   The report also said medical specialists from Hiroshima
University have tracked nearly 5,800 former employees of the
chemical weapons factory who suffered lasting injuries from working
with the substances.
   ``Cancer of the respiratory organs is particularly high,
suggesting a direct link with the inhalation of poison gas,'' the
report said.
   One worker ``recalled in an interview that the factory was so
contaminated that workers had to keep an eye on caged parakeets,
which dropped dead when gas leakage rose,'' the report said.

   President Reagan today saluted America's
Olympic athletes, calling them ``as patriotic as the Pledge of
Allegiance, as red, white and blue as the flag.''
   ``Our athletes are a remarkable group, not only for their
achievements, but also for how they represent so much of what is
good and beautiful and splendid about this sweet and promised
land,'' the president said in his weekly radio address.
   As he has in most of his recent radio speeches, the president
mentioned Republican presidential nominee George Bush, saying that
the vice president was ``representing all of us'' when he saw the
athletes off to Seoul, South Korea, two weeks ago.
   ``You can see the American spirit in the lives of every one of
our team members at these games,'' Reagan said. ``This team comes
from all over our nation _ from the rough and tumble streets of our
brawny cities to the quiet lanes of our vast countryside, from the
suburban hills of Southern California to riverfront towns in the
Midwest.''
   ``There is so much we have to be proud of in our Olympic team
this year,'' Reagan said.
   ``Our athletes have a love, a happiness and an exuberance in
being American,'' he said. ``They're as patriotic as the Pledge of
Allegiance, as red, white and blue as the flag. They're filled with
the spirit of our land.''

   Democratic vice presidential candidate
Lloyd Bentsen, finishing a four-day Southern campaign swing,
declared Saturday that Democrats who voted for President Reagan in
1980 and 1984 are ``coming back in droves.''
   The Texas senator told an enthusiastic, partisan audience in a
small college auditorium that his ticket represented ``the
difference between performance and promise. It's a message we
understand here in the South.''
   ``I've spent a lot of time in the last month going around
visiting ... Democrats that have voted for Reagan,'' he said. ``And
I've gone to them and said, `Come home' ... and they're coming back
in droves.''
   Vice President George Bush had failed in his role as Reagan's
appointee to lead the fight against drug imports in Florida,
Bentsen said.
   ``And now George Bush wants a promotion,'' he said, drawing
laughter from the crowd. ``And he wants to pass the torch of
failure on to the junior senator from Indiana,'' Republican vice
presidential candidate Dan Quayle.
   Bentsen spoke in front of a huge American flag, behind a
collection of nautical items including a ship's wheel and lobster
traps.
   On the stage with him was Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., with whom
Bentsen has gone quail hunting in the past. ``We're opening Quayle
season a little early this year,'' Bentsen said, repeating one of
his favorite lines.
   In this conservative area of the Florida panhandle, near two
major military installations, Bentsen tried to underline what he
said was a commitment to a strong defense by Democratic nominee
Michael Dukakis.
   ``Our message to the new South, our message to America, is
strength and stability for national defense,'' he said.
   ``We support a strong nuclear deterrent. We support the triad,
powerful reliable strategic weapons on the land, in the air and
under the sea,'' he said.
   He did not mention Dukakis' opposition to two programs for
modernizing the land-based leg of the triad, the MX and Midgetman
missiles. Bentsen himself has supported both of those programs.
   Chiles described Bentsen as ``the third senator from Florida''
for all the work he's done for the state.
   But even enthusiastic supporters in the audience doubted the
panhandle would go for the ticket.
   ``You're in the middle of the redneck Riviera,'' said Kay
Horton, who was the area's lone Dukakis delegate to the Democratic
National Convention.
   Jerry Miller, Democratic chairman of nearby Okaloosa County,
said Reagan took the area 65 percent to 35 percent last time.
   ``The comparison with four years ago is like night and day,'' he
said.
   ``We've got a fighting chance at even this time,'' he said.
   Bentsen was returning to Washington Saturday afternoon to attend
to Senate business on Monday.

   Armed Buddhist monks and students took
over a government building Saturday, forcing 24 soldiers to
surrender in the latest escalation of unrest threatening to topple
the authoritarian government.
   The occupation of the Ministry of Trade building in downtown
Rangoon was believed to be the first in which a government office
in the capital was taken over by protesters fighting to end 26
years of repression under the Burma Socialist Program Party.
   The soldiers first opened fire on the protesters and slightly
wounded three people. They later surrendered and were disguised as
protesters with red headbands and allowed to escape, witnesses
said. Mobs outside the building had threatened to behead the guards.
   The shooting was believed to be the first time soldiers fired on
demonstrators since the Aug. 8-12 rioting that ousted hard-line
President Sein Lwin and left 112 people dead by the government's
count. They previously shot only at escaping prisoners and mobs of
looters.
   Elsewhere, three people accused of offering poisoned water to
protesters two weeks ago were beaten to death by a mob and beheaded
after the monks released them from custody, witnesses said.
   Up to 500,000 demonstrators, including striking government
workers and policemen, took part in peaceful marches in Rangoon,
carying placards that said, ``If we don't get it (democracy), we
will hit out.''
   Western-educated lawyer Maung Maung took over Aug. 19 as the
first civilian leader since the 1962 military coup, but protesters
have rejected his plan for the ruling party to supervise a general
election under a multiparty system. They have demanded an interim
government be formed to conduct the polling.
   Witnesses said the troops guarding the ministry building opened
fire after a surging group of protesters surrounded the building
and threatened to set it ablaze.
   Clambering over adjacent rooftops, students entered the top
floor of the four-story structure. Twenty-four soldiers inside
surrendered to monks, who drove them away after seizing a
submachine gun and several semi-automatic weapons.
   Protesters also ringed the City Hall and Central Bank buildings
nearby and shots were heard, but there apparently was no bloodshed.
After reinforcements arrived, about 100 soldiers were posted at
both buildings.
   Security forces have sided with protesters in towns including
Victoria Point in the southernmost province of Mergui. On Sept. 9,
500 servicemen joined protest marches in Rangoon in the first major
military defections.
   State-run Radio Rangoon Saturday urged army personnel to return
to their duties and work toward ``consolidating sovereignty,
national unity.''
   Opposition leaders, who were believed to be negotiating with the
government on formation of an interim administration, have tried to
prevent violence.
   On Friday, leading dissident Aung Gyi defused a potentially
bloody confrontation between soldiers and 100,000 demonstrators
moving on the heavily guarded Ministry of Defense compound with
spears, swords and knives.
   Aung Gyi, a former army brigadier, told the crowd, ``We cannot
blame these soldiers for the faults of some of their commanders.''
   Street protests have persisted despite a series of concessions
by Maung Maung's government.
   The latest, announced by Radio Rangoon Friday, said all military
personnel and civil servants must resign from the ruling party and
not become members of any future political parties.
   It said the decision was made at the recommendation of the
commission that is to supervise the elections, which may occur in
October. Two-thirds of the 2.5 million party members come from
military and civil service ranks.
   Many government workers said Saturday they would not heed a
government warning to return to work by Sept. 26 or face
punishment. Virtually all the workers have been on strike since
Aug. 8, paralyzing the adminstration.
   One effect of the strikes has been the price of rice, the staple
food, has tripled in recent weeks. The U.S. Embassy said Saturday
it would donate $500,000 to religious organizations to buy rice for
needy residents.
   With the political instability, most embassies have evacuated
dependents of their diplomatic staffs and non-essential personnel.
   A number of Japanese were evacuated Saturday to Thailand after
the embassy in Rangoon urged the remaining 108 Japanese there to
leave. About 100 Americans had left earlier.
   Security forces killed scores of people in quelling student-led
protests in March and June. That set the stage for the July 23
resignation of Ne Win, who had ruled since he staged the 1962 coup.
   More protests flared after Sein Lwin succeeded him. The
government said security forces killed 112 people in Rangoon before
Sein Lwin resigned Aug. 12 after 17 days in power, but Western
diplomats said the death toll may have been much higher.

   President Reagan saluted U.S. Olympic athletes
Saturday and urged Americans to ``remember, win, lose or draw, how
much we have to be proud and thankful for.''
   The president devoted most of his weekly radio address,
delivered from the presidential retreat at Camp David in Maryland's
Catoctin Mountains, to the games that began Friday in Seoul, South
Korea.
   The patriotic tone of the address recalled Reagan's acceptance
speech at the 1984 Republican National Convention, in which he
spoke of that summers's Olympics.
   In that speech in Dallas, Reagan likened the Olympic runners'
torch to ``another torch, the one that greeted so many of our
parents and grandparents ... Miss Liberty's torch.''
   In Saturday's address, the president said he agreed with the
remarks of Vice President George Bush, who saw the athletes off to
Seoul two weeks ago.
   In his send-off speech, Bush said the athletes ``stand for the
country of the little guy, the country where no matter what the
circumstances of your birth and background, you can go anywhere and
do anything.''
   The vice president, said Reagan, was ``representing all of us''
in his remarks.
   ``Our athletes are a remarkable group, not only for their
achievements, but also for how they represent so much of what is
good and beautiful and splendid about this sweet and promised
land,'' the president said.
   ``They're as patriotic as the Pledge of Allegiance, as red,
white and blue as the flag,'' he said.
   ``So as you watch these Olympics, remember, win, lose or draw,
how much we have to be proud and thankful for. After all, we're
Americans.''

<HEAD>Coleman Blasts Bush's Handling Of Drug War</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush has been ``non-combatant'' as the
Reagan administration's point man in the war on drugs and the grim
toll has climbed, with ``more deaths, more wasted lives, more
shattered families,'' a Texas Democrat said Saturday.
   ``While George Bush was in charge, he himself said the nation is
losing ground in the war on drugs. That's because he's used only
one weapon in the war: hot air,'' Rep. Ron Coleman said in the
Democratic response to President Reagan's weekly radio address.
   Coleman accused the vice president of supporting funding cuts to
enforcement and drug treatment programs, slashing personnel and
leading an ineffective border interdiction system that even the
head of the Drug Enforcement Administration recommended be
abolished.
   Coleman pointed to a survey of drug enforcement officials by the
watchdog General Accounting Office that showed more than half
believing that Bush's anti-drug programs had ``no effect'' or had
``somewhat worsened'' drug interdiction efforts.
   He also took aim at a proposal by the Republican presidential
nominee to put his running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, in
charge of the drug fight if the two are elected.
   ``This is the fellow who, until last week, wasn't even aware his
boss had been directing the administration's anti-drug efforts,''
Coleman said of Quayle.
   ``The Medellin Cartel (Colombian drug dealers) isn't exactly
worried at the thought that J. Danforth Quayle might take aim at
their deadly business with his press releases,'' Coleman said,
referring to Quayle's work as a public relations officer for the
Indiana National Guard during the Vietnam War.
   ``How can he be put in charge of this war when he wouldn't fight
in the last one? We still haven't forgotten the last time he was
given the opportunity to carry a rifle for his country,'' Coleman
said. ``This is a fellow who sat out the last war typing press
releases in Indiana.''

   Here is the text of the Democratic response to
President Reagan's weekly radio address:
   Hello. I'm Congressman Ron Coleman from Texas.
   Those of us along the U.S.-Mexico border live on the front lines
of the war on drugs. You can walk into the desert from my home in
El Paso any night and hear the drone of aircraft flying north with
their deadly cardo.
   The Reagan-Bush administration's point man in the war on drugs
is the man who would be president _ George Bush.
   But the stubborn facts are these:
   While George Bush was in charge, he himself said the nation is
losing ground in the war on drugs. That's because he's used only
one weapon in the war: hot air.
   While George Bush was in charge, he tried to cut $238 million
from drug enforcement funding for state and local police
departments.
   While George Bush was in charge, he tried to cut drug treatment
funding by 50 percent.
   While George Bush was in charge, not once did Mr. Bush demand
economic sanctions _ under a law he said he wanted _ against
countries that won't cooperate in the war on drugs.
   While George Bush was in charge, 2,000 Coast Guard personnel
have been cut from the war on drugs.
   While George Bush was in charge, the Reagan-Bush administration
created the tough-sounding National Narcotics Border Interdiction
System, but it worked so badly that the head of the Drug
Enforcement Administration said it should be abolished.
   While George Bush was in charge, the Reagan-Bush administration
tried to kill the program that helps state and local governments
pursue drug traffickers.
   While George Bush was in charge, Panama's drug-smuggling
dictator, General Noriega, was on the U.S. government payroll _
lining his pockets and returning the favor by lining our morgues
with the bodies of our young people.
   While George Bush was in charge, the cost of cocaine in Miami
plummeted 600 percent.
   While George Bush was in charge, cocaine deaths doubled
nationwide.
   While George Bush was in charge, the grim drug toll has climbed
_ more deaths, more wasted lives, more shattered families.
   The verdict of drug enforcement officials nationwide in a survey
by the watchdog General Accounting Office? More than half said
George Bush's anti-drug program had ``no effect'' or had ``somewhat
worsened`` drug interdiction efforts.
   And what's George Bush's latest proposal? Putting vice
presidential hopeful J. Danforth Quayle in charge. You'll remember
this is the fellow who, until last week, wasn't even aware his boss
had been directing the administration's anti-drug efforts.
   Imagine. J. Danforth Quayle in charge of the war on drugs. How
can he be put in charge of this war when he wouldn't fight in the
last one? We still haven't forgotten the last time he was given the
opportunity to carry a rifle for his country.
   This is a fellow who sat out the last war typing press releases
in Indiana. This is a fellow who voted to drop drug charges against
Panama's indicted dictator.
   Putting the vice president in charge of the war on drugs isn't a
new idea. President Reagan tried it. It didn't work then. And it
certainly won't work now under the country club direction of golfer
J. Danforth Quayle.
   The stubborn fact is the George Herbert Walker Bush and J.
Danforth Quayle have been noncombatants in the war on drugs. The
Medellin Cartel isn't exactly worried at the thought that J.
Danforth Quayle might take aim at their deadly business with his
press releases.
   Several days ago, the nation was shocked by the story of a
little boy in New Orleans named Shrimpy. Shrimpy worked for two
years for drug dealers and lost a bag of crack. He got a bullet in
his head from point-blank range. Shrimpy was 11 years old.
   The problem isn't just saying no to drugs. It's getting a new
president and vice president who will say yes to fighting the war.
   This is Congressman Ron Coleman from Texas for a drug-free
America. Thank you, and have a good weekend.

   Here is the text of President Reagan's weekly
radio address, delivered from Camp David, Md.:
   My fellow Americans, let me begin this talk with a special
message to the people of Texas.
   Last night, many of you endured the ravages of Hurricane
Gilbert. Today, as you wait for the waters to recede and the
cleanup to begin, Nancy and I and all Americans hold you in our
prayers.
   We all have one blessing to count: Warning came early. You were
ready; so were we. The federal government has spent the last week
preparing to help during and after the storm.
   We've offered help as well to our international friends who felt
Gilbert's full force. As I told Jamaican Prime Minister Edward
Seaga, we're ready to play an active role in helping them to
rebuild.
   Now, on a happier note, if you're like me, you look forward
every four years to a very special event: The Summer Olympics. As
you know, this week and next, the Olympics are being held in Seoul,
South Korea.
   Last night, athletes from all over the world marched around the
Olympic Stadium there and stood and watched as a single
torch-bearer climbed the steps and lit the Olympic flame, marking
the start of the Games.
   I'm sure that, like me, you'll be proud of all these young men
and women, and particularly of our own American athletes. Our
athletes are a remarkable group, not only for their achievements,
but for how they represent so much of what is good and beautiful
and splendid about this sweet and promised land.
   As Vice President Bush said when, representing all of us, he saw
them off two weeks ago, they stand for the country of the little
guy, the country where no matter what the circumstances of your
birth or background, you can go anywhere and do anything; where the
millionaire has no more vote than the pauper; where the sense of
possibilities is so palpable you can almost breathe it in the air.
   The Vice President was right, and I've always thought you could
see the spirit of which he spoke in all our Olympic athletes. You
can see it in the way so many of them will pause in their daily
training in Seoul, as our athletes have at past Olympics, to help
competitors from countries where good coaching is hard, if not
impossible, to find. You can see it in stories that have been told
about American Olympians over the years, like the one about a
boyhood hero of mine, Jim Thorpe.
   In the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm, Thorpe took the gold in both
the pentathlon and the decathlon. He was the most talked about
competitor at those Games. With his medals won, Thorpe was
presented to the King of Sweden, who said, ``You, sir, are the
world's greatest athlete.'' And what was Thorpe's reply to this
august European monarch? It was simple, straightforward and
American. He said, ``Thanks, King.''
   And you can see the American spirit in the lives of every one of
our team members at these games. This team comes from all over our
nation, from the rough-and-tumble streets of our brawny cities to
the quiet lanes of our vast countryside; from the suburban hills of
Southern California to riverfront towns n the Midwest; they
represent every aspect of our country's life, and a shining hope,
too _ a crystalline beacon of opportunity that we know is the heart
of America.
   One athlete, raised in very modest circumstances, recalled
recently that, quote, ``We were rich as a family,'' unquote. And
that wealth of love has given her the strength to achieve her
dream, just as throughout our history the wealth of family love has
given countless millions of Americans the strength to pursue their
dreams in our land of opportunity.
   There's so much we have to be proud of in our Olympic team this
year. In all teams, from all over the world, no group of young men
and women is quite like them. They're filled with optimism for the
future, with faith in the boundless possibilities of humanity, with
zest for a life pursuing excellence, pursuing achievement, pursuing
the limits of their God-given abilities, and piercing beyond what
they thought were those limits.
   As an Olympic athlete from another nation recently marveled
about our nation and its people, he said, ``In America, they
appreciate achievement and faith in the future. In fact,'' he said,
``it's a prerequisite for getting around.'' And he concluded,
contrasting the energy of the United States to other countries he
had known, ``For everybody in the street in America, every day is a
competition.''
   Yes, our athletes have a love, a happiness, and an exuberance in
being American. They're as patriotic as the Pledge of Allegiance,
as red, white, and blue as the flag. They are filled with the
spirit of our land and all of its magnificent diversity, a
diversity you can see, even in their faces.
   When you look at most other teams, it's easy to tell what
continent or region they're from, but we Americans come from every
continent and region. Ours are the faces of all humanity, just as
our nation was built by the hopes of all humanity.
   So, as you watch these Olympics, remember, win, lose, or draw,
how much we have to be proud and thankful for. After all, we're
Americans.
   Until next week, thanks for listening, and God bless you.

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Waite Will Be Released Soon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Beirut weekly said Saturday that
missing Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite will be released soon.
   Ash-Shiraa cited no sources for its report that Waite will be
released ``as a result of an orchestration between Britain and
Iran, including London's denunciation of Iraq for using chemical
weapons against the Kurds.''
   Ash-Shiraa broke the story of secret U.S. arms sales to Iran in
1986, but has not been accurate in its recent reporting on foreign
hostages in Lebanon, including several reports that hostages would
be released imminently.
   Waite, 48, disappeared Jan. 20, 1987 after leaving a seaside
hotel in Moslem west Beirut to negotiate with kidnappers of
American hostages.
   There has been no confirmed claim of responsibility for his
abduction.
   Ash-Shiraa said Iran ``is now directly in charge of the
hostages' affairs in Lebanon.''
   The report said the release of German hostage Rudolf Cordes on
Monday ``sparked anger and confusion within Hezbollah (Party of
God) because it was carried out without consulting the party.''
   Hezbollah, made up of Shiite Moslem zealots loyal to Iran's
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, is believed to be the umbrella group
for those holding foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   Cordes' release leaves 17 foreigners missing in Lebanon,
including nine Americans.
   The longest held is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped in Beirut
on March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Israeli and Lebanese Forces Withdraw After Guerrilla Search</HEAD>

   Israeli forces and allied Lebanese
militiamen withdrew to the Israeli-occupied security zone Saturday
after a 24-hour search operation for guerrillas in southern
Lebanon, police said.
   About 250 Israeli troops and militiamen of the South Lebanon
Army in 29 tanks and armored vehicles pulled back to the security
zone before dawn after searching a 24-square-mile area for
guerrillas.
   A police spokesman said the Israelis and their allies ``did not
face any resistance during the operation'' which was carried out
just south of Syrian army lines in the western sector of Lebanon's
Bekaa valley.
   Five Lebanese citizens were wounded during the sweep, and shells
severely damaged at least 15 houses in the villages of Mimess and
Ain Ata, the spokesman said. The official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, did not say how the five were injured.
   The search was launched Friday hours after an Israeli army
patrol foiled an infiltration attempt inside the security zone,
killing three guerrillas.
   Talaat Yacoub's pro-Syrian Palestine Liberation Front claimed
responsibility for the attack in a communique released in the
southern port city of Sidon.
   The attempted infiltration Friday was the second abortive
attempt in six days to cross the six-to-10-mile security zone
established by Israel.
   A week ago, Israeli soldiers captured four guerrillas after
seriously wounding one of them in the zone.
   Israel set up its security zone after withdrawing the bulk of
its occupation army from southern Lebanon in June 1985 after a
three-year occupation. The zone is intended to serve as a buffer
against cross-border raids.
   The strip is patrolled by about 1,000 Israeli troops and an
equal number of militiamen.
   Also Saturday, gunmen wounded three Ghanaian peacekeepers
serving with the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon in the southern town
of Abbasiyeh, a U.N. spokesman said.
   The U.N. spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the gunmen chased the U.N. jeep and opened fire after it had an
accident with a civilian car.
   ``The attackers escaped and civilians evacuated the three
wounded Ghanaian soldiers to a hospital'' in the southern port city
of Tyre, the spokesman said.
   He said the three Ghanians were admitted to UNIFIL's field
hospital at the border town of Naqoura. Their condition was
satisfactory, he said.
   The 5,800-strong UNIFIL, with soldiers from nine countries, has
been based in southern Lebanon since March 1978.

   Officials predicted disaster and
talked of fingerprinting those who stayed behind to identify their
bodies. Gulf coast residents from Grand Isle, La., to this
tip-of-Texas town boarded up their windows and fled.
   But in the end, it was Gilbert, ``the storm of the century,''
who stayed away _ turning out to be too big to turn north, too
gracious to blast the U.S. coast.
   ``We were waiting for the storm, but it never showed up,'' said
Francisco Garcia as he used a crowbar to pry plywood off his
family's barbecue hut. ``Some people are mad a little bit that they
spent money and the hurricane never showed up.''
   Meteorologists' predictions that Gilbert, like past hurricanes,
would turn north toward Texas or Louisiana and strengthen after
battering Mexico's Yucatan Penninsula proved wrong. Gilbert hardly
strayed from its west-northwest course.
   ``He was so large it was too hard to veer,'' said Greg Flatt of
the National Weather Service here. ``It was controlling the weather
pattern. The weather pattern wasn't controlling it.''
   Said Neil Frank, former director of the National Hurricane
Center and now weatherman for KHOU in Houston: ``This storm was so
big it just did its own thing and charged right into Mexico.''
   Gilbert dumped up to 6 inches of rain on areas and spun off
deadly tornadoes that destroyed a few homes, damaged roofs and
shattered windows. Across the Rio Grande in Mexico, as in Jamaica
and Haiti, the damage was widespread and severe.
   ``I don't think anybody's going to feel this was the wrong thing
to do,'' Corpus Christi Mayor Betty Turner said of the evacuation
in her town, where thousands of residents crowded into shelters.
   ``This isn't new to South Texas,'' said Corpus Christi police
chief Robert Olson. ``People know what hurricanes can do. I think
that should another one arise, they'll respond just as well.''
   On Galveston Island near Houston, several hundred miles from
where Gilbert hit, an evacuation order was under fire. And some in
poor neighborhoods of this border town complained about the expense
of hurricane preparations.
   But when the sky cleared, most said they held no hard feelings
over the no-show hurricane.
   ``I'd rather be safe than sorry,'' said Rosbel Villarreal, who
boarded up the home he recently bought here and took his family,
including three young children, to a motel in McAllen. ``I spent
probably $150 but I didn't want to take a chance.''
   ``Sometimes they hit here, sometimes they don't. You never
know,'' said Jeni Hinojosa as she swept up fallen leaves and
branches from her yard.
   Guadalupe Longoria remembers more brutal storms here like Allen
and Beulah. But she stayed in her home alone, praying, all Friday
night.
   ``I was expecting whatever the dear Lord sends us,'' she said.
   By Saturday morning, a steady stream of cars and campers
returned to wind-whipped Brownsville and the city that had gone
into hibernation returned to life. Lines formed at bakeries, and
crews began picking up the fallen palms and branches.
   For five days reports on Gilbert's brute force prompted coastal
residents to batten down the hatches and prepare for a fierce storm
that made its mark on history with the lowest recorded barometric
pressure in the hemisphere.
   Thousands of residents evacuated, but most stayed, saying either
they felt safe in their own homes and would tough it out, or they
feared looters.
   Plywood shot up to $15 a sheet in some areas. There were long
lines at grocery stores, and hotels hundreds of miles away took in
Gilbert escapees.
   ``You've got to do it,'' Garcia said. ``The meteorologists made
a mistake, but anybody can make a mistake. You never know with
hurricanes.''

<HEAD>Solidarity Leader: Government Says Independent Union Has A Future</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CZESTOCHOWA, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Solidarity has a
future in Poland but refused to lift a 6-year-old ban on the East
bloc's first independent union federation, a union leader reported
Saturday.
   ``They clearly said, `Give us time,''' said Wladyslaw Frasyniuk,
describing a meeting Friday between Solidarity chief Lech Walesa,
Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak and 22 other people from the
government, Solidarity and the church.
   Walesa meanwhile traveled to this southern city Saturday for an
annual workers' pilgrimage and to report to other Solidarity
leaders about prospects for legalizing the union.
   Walesa agreed to end a wave of strikes last month after the
government agreed to talk to Solidarity about legalization. The
labor unrest posed the strongest challenge to the communist
government since it crushed Solidarity in the 1981 martial law
crackdown. The union was banned in 1982.
   Frasyniuk, Solidarity leader in in the southwestern city of
Wroclaw, met with a small group of reporters early Saturday.
   He said Kiszczak informed Solidarity members Friday that
Solidarity has a future but told union activists that he could not
take a decision on legalizing it now because his hands are tied.
   He said alternate Politburo member Stanislaw Ciosek told the
meeting the police and army are resisting the push to legalize
Solidarity because they ``fear this symbol.''
   ``Can we call this a great success? I think not. Success will
occur when Solidarity has the right to return to legal activity,''
Frasyniuk said.
   But he said the union ``cannot involve itself in interminable
discussions, because the people we represent expect concrete
effects.''
   Frasyniuk said Solidarity decided to continue talks even without
a firm commitment because it did not want to be seen as being the
first to break off the process of negotiation.
   After the meeting, Solidarity members had ``a feeling of
victory,'' he said. ``You could see that the problem of Solidarity
was the dominant one, and nobody directly attacked Solidarity.''
   ``We now see that the legalization of Solidarity isn't one
single act to grant or not. It is a process,'' said Zbigniew Bujak,
a Warsaw Solidarity leader.
   Newspapers on Saturday carried a brief government communique
about the meeting and listed those who attended. But there was no
confirmation of Frasyniuk's account.
   In an unusual move, the Politburo of the Polish United Workers'
(communist) Party held a meeting Saturday to review ``the current
problems of the socio-political situation of the country,'' the
state-run news service PAP said. It gave no further details. The
Politburo normally meets only on Tuesdays.
   The talks at a government villa outside Warsaw marked the first
time a national delegation of Solidarity activists met with
authorities and the official trade union alliance OPZZ, which was
set up after Solidarity was banned.
   Although their union remains illegal, Solidarity members wore
union pins during the meeting and were treated with respect by the
officials present, Frasyniuk said.
   But Andrzej Stelmachowski, a pro-Solidarity law professor who
served as a mediator to set up the meeting, said ``some bitter
things were exchanged'' during the six hours of talks. He did not
elaborate.
   The meeting was to discuss terms for large-scale talks on
Poland's future, including the subject of Solidarity and trade
union pluralism. The sides agreed that the talks would convene in
mid-October.
   Walesa left Warsaw on Saturday for the Jasna Gora monastery in
Czestochowa, site of the Black Madonna painting, Poland's most
revered icon.
   He was to attend a workers' pilgrimage that annually draws tens
of thousands of Solidarity supporters. It was begun by the
pro-Solidarity priest the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko before his murder
by police agents in 1984.
   In the Soviet Union, meanwhile, the state-run media softened
their hard-line support of the Polish government. They said
officials and protesters must share the blame for many of Poland's
problems and that the two should compromise.
   The daily newspapers Sovietskaya Rossiya and Izvestia carried
commentaries Friday suggesting that workers were driven to strike
by the government's mishandling of sharp price increases in the
spring.
   Sovietskaya Rossiya said trust in Poland's government has eroded
so badly that the leadership may not survive.

<TEXT>
   Maryland's top law official pulled two
``Saturday Night Special'' handguns from underneath his business
suit to make a point at a breakfast for gun control advocates.
   Bishop L. Robinson, the secretary of public safety and
correctional services, pulled out the guns to illustrate how easily
they could be concealed, stunning guests invited to Gov. William
Donald Schaefer's fund-raising breakfast Friday morning.
   ``My God, it was so dramatic,'' said Harold C. Donofrio, an
advertising executive. ``Bishop does not dress in loose clothing.
... Not a bulge anywhere.
   ``All of a sudden, he gets a gun from inside his belt, and the
next thing you know he's got this thing in the palm of his hand. He
passes that one off to someone, reaches somewhere else and gets
another gun,'' Donofrio said.
   Schaefer invited 40 supporters to the private breakfast to raise
funds to back Maryland's handgun control bill, the first of its
kind in the nation, whose fate will be decided in a referendum on
the Nov. 8 ballot.
   After Robinson's demonstration, they came up with on-the-spot
pledges of an estimated $75,000 to $100,000 to help support the
bill.
   Schaefer signed the bill, which seeks to ban the sale of cheap
handguns known as Saturday Night Specials, in May.
   However, a group called the Maryland Committee Against the Gun
Ban, with support from the National Rifle Association, conducted a
vigorous campaign to repeal the law, submitting enough petition
signatures to bring the issue before state voters.
   Critics contend the law could lead to a ban on the sale of all
new handguns. Defenders say it will only affect cheaply made
Saturday Night Specials.
   Bruce C. Bereano, a top state lobbyist and supporter of the gun
bill, said the breakfast was a signal that from the governor's
standpoint the campaign to save the bill ``is going to be todus
porkus _ whole hog.''

<HEAD>Company Drops Health Plan That Wouldn't Cover Drug or Alcohol
Abuse, AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Circle K Corp. has dropped a plan to limit
medical-care coverage for employees because of ``lifestyle
decisions,'' such as those who contracted AIDS or suffered from
drug or alcohol abuse.
   ``Effective immediately, we have canceled implementation of
these specific limitations due to the widespread misunderstanding
of both the intent and the specifics of the changes,'' Circle K
President Robert Reade said in a memorandum to employees.
   The memorandum, dated Tuesday, was made public Friday.
   In January, the Phoenix-based chain of convenience stores told
its 26,000 employees that rising medical costs had forced it to
implement a policy of not paying for the medical care of people
suffering disease or injury as a result of lifestyles. The company
does not buy health insurance, instead paying medical claims out of
its own budget.
   The policy did not receive widespread attention until August,
when it triggered complaints and demonstrations. Critics said it
discriminated against victims of acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   Company officials said the policy was intended to apply only to
employees hired since Jan. 1 _ limiting the number affected to
about 3,000 _ and claimed Circle K never intended to investigate
how employees became infected with AIDS, which is most often
transmitted through homosexual sex or sharing of needles by
intravenous drug abusers.
   However, the chain temporarily suspended the policy and gave it
up this month.
   Reade said company learned from the flap that ``impressions and
perceptions many times are more important than intentions. It's
such a volatile and sensitive issue that I think no matter how
carefully we explained it, we would have been misconstrued.''
   ``I'm just delighted,'' said Kathleen Barnes, director of the
Arizona AIDS Project.
   ``The biggest danger was always that other companies were going
to follow their lead,'' she said. ``Now this is going to help keep
everyone else in check.''
   Other companies reportedly had considered similar steps in the
face of increases of 20 percent to 30 percent a year in the cost of
employee medical insurance and estimates by the federal government
that, by 1991, the medical bill for AIDS will top $10 billion a
year. The medical cost of alcoholism already is $13 billion a year.

<HEAD>Character Actor Louis Quinn Who Starred On `77 Sunset Strip' Dead
At 73</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Louis Quinn, a veteran gag writer turned
character actor who became known to millions of TV viewers as
Roscoe the horse player on the hit 1950s and '60s detective show
``77 Sunset Strip,'' has died at age 73.
   Quinn died Wednesday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center of lung
cancer.
   He began his writing career in radio after graduation from Los
Angeles High School, turning out material for such stars as Orson
Welles, Paul Whiteman and Milton Berle and for such shows as ``The
Breakfast Club.''
   When Berle moved from radio to television, Quinn followed and
wrote for ``The Texaco Star Theater,'' which featured the comedian.
   He went on to act as host of some of his own shows, including a
program on Los Angeles station KHJ-TV and radio interview shows
broadcast from Chicago's Crossroads Lounge and New York City's
Copacabana.
   He also appeared in such movies as ``Gypsy,'' ``The Al Capone
Story'' and ``The Crowded Sky.''
   Quinn gained perhaps his widest audience from 1958 to 1963 when
he played Roscoe, the comical horse-race handicapper who hung
around a Los Angeles detective agency in ``77 Sunset Strip.''
   Other TV credits included appearances in such westerns as
``Lawman,'' ``Maverick'' and ``Sugarfoot.''
   Quinn is survived by a daughter, brother and four sisters.

<HEAD>Publisher Bought Land Despite Book Predicting Rapture</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A book publisher bought land for a new
headquarters in April while planning to publish a booklet
predicting the beginning of the end of the world would occur in
September.
   Norvell Olive, 47, executive director of the World Bible Society
in Nashville, spent $114,000 for the land as he arranged to publish
the booklet, ``88 Reasons Why the Rapture Will Happen in 1988.''
   The booklet, written by Edgar Whisenant of Little Rock, Ark.,
predicted that Jesus would ``rapture the church'' and believers
would be taken up to heaven during the Jewish new year. He
initially said the `rapture' would occur by sunset Tuesday but
later revised it to Wednesday morning.
   Whisenant, a retired engineer and self-taught Bible student,
also said there would be seven years of plague, famine and nuclear
war before Christ's Second Coming.
   Olive said he went ahead with the purchase of the 3.13 acres of
land in Nashville because negotiations had taken a long time.
   ``We had had a contract on the property for a year,'' Olive said.
   He said the World Bible Society would disperse profits from the
booklet if the predictions in it do not come true by the end of the
year. In a news release, the society did not say how the profits
would be dispersed, and telephone calls to the society's officer
were not answered Saturday.
   The organization estimated net proceeds at between $200,000 and
$300,000.
   The society, a non-profit corporation Olive founded in 1979,
said it has distributed more than 2 million copies of the booklet
but more than 1 million books were given away free. The booklet,
priced at 30 cents to $2 each, cost 15 cents to produce and is now
out of print.
   ``The book has created a sweeping revival across the country,''
the news release said. ``It is estimated that up to 100,000 people
may have made new confessions of faith.''
   Orders for the booklet are still coming in but won't be filled,
Olive said.
   The Nashville Banner reported Saturday that Olive awaited the
rapture on a 68-foot luxury houseboat on nearby Percy Priest Lake.
   ``Yes, I live comfortably,'' he said. ``The Lord has helped me
to live comfortably.''

   Broken trees and traffic lights
littered city streets Saturday, but many residents were just happy
to have homes to return to.
   More than 5,000 people left shelters around town early Saturday
after the main force of Hurricane Gilbert passed through Mexico
about 100 miles to the south.
   ``I'm kind of glad to be back home. I didn't know what I was
going to find. My house is 80 years old and I thought it was going
to be blown away but it wasn't,'' said Odilon Gracia, 75.
   He said he waited out the storm at an elementary school with a
leaking roof and wet floors. ``I feel a little better in my house
than at that school,'' he said.
   While the shelters emptied, the city grew congested. Restaurants
and food stores closed for two days opened their doors again. Cars
lined up at gas stations.
   Residents pried protective plywood from windows and doors and
mopped up water that had leaked in. Others cut up fallen trees and
hauled them away.
   Despite wind still gusting at more that 30 mph Saturday, work
crews were out picking up dangling traffic lights and downed power
lines that caused some temporary outages Friday.
   Southern Texas was spared the 120 mph wind that whirled around
the eye of Gilbert, but was battered by rain, high wind and
tornadoes spun off by the system.
   ``I thought it was going to be worse, but thank God it wasn't,''
said Gloria Zapata, 40, while she and her family picked up garbage
strewn in their yard by the wind.
   ``I'm thankful it wasn't as hard as it probably could have been
or else everything here would have been blown away.''
   Rosalinda Delgado and her three children spent the night in a
shelter, and were relieved to find their home in good shape.
   ``I was scared, the children were scared, that we weren't going
to have any furniture left when we got back. But everything seems
to be OK,'' Ms. Delgado said.

   Pneumonia and eye and skin diseases
have broken out in Bangladesh in the aftermath of floods that
claimed at least 953 lives, doctors and officials said Saturday.
   ``Over 3,500 medical teams working in the flooded areas are not
fully equipped to handle these new diseases,'' said one Health
Ministry official. ``Most of them are not carrying enough medicines
for these ailments.''
   The government's toll of 953 from the flooding, which inundated
about 80 percent of the country, is considered low. Newspapers put
the toll in excess of 2,000.
   The government's figures include 211 deaths from diarrhea,
caused by the disruption of pure water supplies when floodwaters
washed away pumps and inundated wells. Most of the other deaths
occurred from drownings, and a lesser number from bites by
poisonous snakes.
   Flooding is an annual disaster in Bangladesh, where the 110
million people earn an average per capita income of $150 per year.
Last year, floods during the monsoon season killed at least 1,500
people.
   One doctor in Dhaka said an ``unusually large number'' of
patients from flood-affected areas are suffering from eye ailments
and skin diseases.
   ``The daily average of such cases has increased four- to
six-fold in the last one week,'' said the doctor, Abdur Rahman. ``A
week or 10 days back, the daily average of such patients was about
10. Now it is between 50 and 60 every day.''
   At least 51,792 cases of diarrhea have been reported from
flooded areas, where victims had little or no way to boil water. A
government effort to bring water purification tablets to the
countryside has been largely unsuccessful.
   The reports of the disease outbreaks come as the levels of major
rivers in the low-lying country begin to recede.
   ``By next Friday, most of the water will recede, except from the
low-lying areas close to the rivers,'' said one official at the
Flood Control Center.
   The floods have inundated 53 of the country's 64 districts. But
government efforts to get relief to an estimated 40 million people
have been hampered by lack of communications and resources.
   Many outlying areas remain inaccessible by road, and there is
little dry land for the few helicopters.
   But resumption last Friday of rail traffic between Dhaka, the
capital, and Chittagong, the country's main port, was expected to
boost relief work.
   Bangladesh, one of the poorest countries in the world, relies
heavily on imports. Ninety percent of its imports come through
Chittagong.

   Lebanese presidential candidate Raymond
Edde said Saturday he will not return home even if he wins an
election scheduled for Thursday unless Israeli forces withdraw from
south Lebanon.
   Meanwhile, U.S. envoy Richard Murphy met for more than two hours
Saturday in Damascus with Syrian President Hafez Assad to try to
help Lebanon out of a political crisis threatening to re-ignite
that country's civil war.
   Murphy, assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs,
was accompanied by Washington's new ambassador to Syria, Edward
Djerejian, and David Newton, head of the Syria, Jordan and Lebanon
desk at the State Department.
   American and Syrian officials would not elaborate on the talks,
although one U.S. source close to the delegation said Murphy may
travel to Lebanon this weekend for meetings with Lebanese
officials, including President Amin Gemayel.
   The United States and Syria have been trying to ensure a
president is elected in Lebanon before Friday, when Gemayel's
six-year term expires. Under the constitution, he cannot seek a
second consecutive term.
   Edde, speaking in a telephone interview from Paris, where he has
been living since 1976 after three assassination attempts in
Lebanon, said the success of Thursday's vote was ``unfortunately''
dependent on the Damascus negotiations.
   An attempt to convene Lebanon's parliament Aug. 18 to elect a
president collapsed when Christian deputies, opposed to Syria's
candidate, former President Suleiman Franjieh, boycotted the
session.
   Lebanon's U.S.-aided Christians oppose Syria's efforts to impose
a settlement to end the 13-year-old civil war. Franjieh was the
only serious contender until Edde announced his candidacy last week.
   Edde, a 75-year-old Maronite Christian, said once Israel
withdraws its troops from a so-called ``security zone'' in south
Lebanon, he can ask Syria to withdraw its forces.
   ``Without that, Lebanon is not independent, with the presence of
both the Israeli and Syrian armies,'' said Edde, a former interior
minister.
   The government-run Syrian press, after virtually ignoring Edde,
quoted him Saturday as saying the presence of their army in Lebanon
was legal.
   The article was interpreted as a sign Edde is emerging as a
compromise candidate in the discussions between the Syrian and U.S.
sides.
   Edde confirmed he said Syrian troops were in Lebanon legally
because they were invited there in 1976 by the Lebanese government
and had a peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League. But he said
there would be no need for them once Israel withdrew.
   ``I am convinced there will be no more civil war if there is a
withdrawal because I am confident in the Lebanese people from both
sides, both Moslem and Christian,'' he said.
   Edde said if Israel did not withdraw he would not return to
Lebanon and would instruct parliament instead to elect another
president.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Hurricane Gilbert killed at least
30 people when it swept across Haiti's southern peninsula last
week, the Haiti Disaster Preparedness Office reported Saturday.
   An agronomist said the storm destroyed huge tracts of crops in
the south and predicted a faminie.
   Radio stations, which earlier reported 10 people died when their
boat sank during the storm, broadcast the new government figures
Saturday.
   ``It seems that 50 to 60 percent of agricultural production in
the south has been destroyed. This means that we can expect a
famine in that region within two months,'' Jacques Edouard Alexis,
an agronomist and former dean of the Agronomy School, said Saturday.
   The military government has declared a state of emergency in the
three southern departments, where there is extensive damage to
homes and heavy losses in livestock and fruit trees.
   Coastal roads were flooded and power lines blown down.
   The Canadian government has offered $50,000 in emergency relief
to be channeled through the Roman Catholic Order of Oblate Fathers.
   The U.S. Embassy announced a gift of $25,000 to the Haitian Red
Cross for relief work.
   Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, president of the military government,
expressed sympathy for the victims of the hurricane Friday night.
   ``The military government is conscious of its responsibilities
and duties towards the nation and cannot be insensitive and
indifferent to the misfortune which has befallen us,'' Namphy said.
   At least one political leader questioned why Haiti hadn't better
spent money it has received in the past for hurricane protection
measures.
   ``After all this time that Haiti has been subject to the
possible ravages of hurricanes ... and millions and millions of
dollars have fallen into the hands of its rulers, with what
structures of protection has the country been endowed?'' Gerard
Phillipe-Auguste asked in a statement distributed to the press.
   Phillipe-Auguste was minister of agriculture under President
Leslie Manigat, who was overthrown by Namphy in a military coup in
June.
   Before the arrival of the hurricane, state and private radio
stations broadcast the hurricane emergency instructions prepared by
the disaster office, but no evacuation was announced.

<HEAD>Gilbert Leaves Grand Isle's Highway Just 100 Feet From Shore</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Hurricane Gilbert-US, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRAND ISLE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hurricane Gilbert's waves washed away 25
feet of coastline, leaving the highway connecting the island to the
mainland in danger if another storm hits the Gulf of Mexico, an
official said Saturday.
   ``Now the state is really going to have to get into the scene
because there is a threat to the highway,'' said Mayor Andy
Valence, who ordered the 2,000 inhabitants to evacuate during the
storm.
   Altogether, he said, the resort community lost 100 feet of land
from hurricanes Gilbert and Florence. Now Louisiana Highway 1 is
only 100 feet from shore in some places, he said.
   Grand Isle's losses are only a small part of the coastal erosion
in a state which loses more than 50 square miles of coastal
wetlands each year. But it's a significant amount for an island
about a mile wide and eight miles long facing the open Gulf of
Mexico due south of New Orleans.
   Other parts of the state apparently escaped Gilbert's passage
across the Gulf unscathed, aside from minor damage from a tornado
Friday in Slidell, north of New Orleans.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer will join Valence next week to survey the
coastal damage to the state's only populated barrier island.
   Valence has been trying raise money to build two stone jetties
to stop or at least slow down the erosion.
   The jetties were a major campaign platform for the new mayor,
who took office 75 days ago. Since then, he's had to evacuate the
island four times for hurricanes Beryl, Florence and Gilbert, and a
tropical storm.
   Valence said that's a record for Grand Isle. ``People are very
sensitive to weather conditions here,'' he said. ``At the same
time, we're equally sensitive to Grand Isle's beauty and charm.''
   Valence and about 12 emergency workers rode out the storm on the
island. At its worst point Thursday night, the pounding of the surf
created a salt mist that shorted out and exploded hundreds of power
company transformer connectors.
   Valence lifted his evacuation order Saturday morning, but police
dispatcher Linda Blanchard said many residents went home much
earlier while Gilbert was hitting Mexico.
   ``We started coming back Friday afternoon,'' she said. ``There
was no water on the roads then.''

1838</HEAD>

   A steady rain fell Saturday as a small
wagon train departed from Red Clay State Historical Park for
Tahlequah, Okla., to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the
infamous ``Trail of Tears.''
   ``It's fitting,'' observed Ray Morris, the coordinator of the
project. ``From what I've read, the first bunch of Cherokees were
forced to leave on a day much like this one.''
   Morris, of Golconda, Ill., drove one of the six covered wagons
that will make the 1,000-mile journey, scheduled to end in early
December. Participants hope to call attention to the federal
government's forced removal of the Cherokees from their eastern
homelands in 1838.
   ``I think the blackest chapter of our nation's history began
with the Indian Removal Act of 1830 and culminated with the
relocation of the Cherokees in 1838,'' Morris said.
   ``The government called it a treaty but what it really amounted
to was   ...   at gunpoint. They were made
to leave their homes and walk to Oklahoma so the white settlers
could have their land.''
   According to historical accounts of the trek, the first group of
Cherokees, numbering about 1,000, departed Oct. 1, 1838, from Red
Clay, their last tribal council ground in the East. They were
accompanied by federal troops and state militia. In all, 13 groups
of Indians made the trek.
   ``About 4,000 of the Indians, or more than one-third of those
who started out from Tennessee in the fall of 1838, died along the
way,'' Morris said. ``Yet, there are only two marked graves, in
Hopkinsville, Ky., along the entire route of the Trail Of Tears.
It's a page of our history that's largely been ignored.''
   The wagons that left Red Clay on Saturday were pulled by four
mule teams and two teams of horses. A half-dozen riders on
horseback also joined the first leg of the trek.
   Among the riders was Ricky Todd, a farmer from Woodbury, Tenn.,
who said he first heard of the Trail of Tears as a little boy when
he saw it mentioned on a plaque. Woodbury was one of the towns the
Indians went through.
   Todd is the project's Tennessee coordinator.
   ``This is an educational project and we'd like for people to
come out and walk or ride with us for a while,'' he said. ``In my
town, I know, the schoolchildren will be coming down to see the
wagon train and learn more about what happened on the Trail of
Tears.''
   ``We want them to know that the Cherokees weren't savages in
loincloths, that they were a civilized people whose land was stolen
by the white man.''
   Morris said the wagons represent each of the six states the
Cherokees went through on their way to Oklahoma.
   ``The Cherokees followed a circuitous route through Tennessee,
Kentucky, Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas and Oklahoma, a route that
later would be known as the Trail of Tears,'' he said. ``We're
going to stay as close to that route as is possible.''
   Prior to embarking, Morris read a letter from Wilma Mankiller,
the principal chief of the Cherokee Nation at Tahlequah.
   ``Those of you who are taking part in this commemoration of the
Cherokee Trail of Tears cannot conceive the human misery of those
you now honor,'' she wrote.
   ``The Cherokee people had lived much like their rural southern
neighbors. They were a settled, agricultural people with a
democratic form of government. The effect of the removal was to
thrust the Cherokee people back into the Stone Age.''
   Morris, an agricultural adviser, said he expects the trip to
take 76 days, or about half as long as it took the Cherokees to get
to Oklahoma. Participants are financing the trip out of their own
pockets, except for $1,000 donated by the state of Illinois, he
said.
   ``I know we'll run into some problems along the way, but they
won't be anything compared with the sacrifices the Cherokees had to
make,'' he said.

   First-term Mayor Ygnacio Garza never
wanted to be in the spotlight, but he has had a hectic summer
dealing with a store roof collapse that killed 14 and coordinating
efforts to prepare for a hurricane.
   By city charter, the mayor's post is not very powerful, but
Garza has taken control of a city where several former top
officials were accused of wrongdoing.
   Garza, a 35-year-old certified public accountant who served as a
city commissioner in 1979-83, said he stayed out of politics after
his first venture because he didn't think it was for him.
   He returned last year to help manage his native city's
administration after it was rocked by scandal.
   ``Although the city charter gives the mayor very little power,
the leadership has to be shown regardless of what the charter
says,'' said Garza, a 6-foot-6 man nicknamed ``Nacho.'' ``You have
to assume a leadership role if you are going to lead a city through
a crisis.''
   On July 7, the roof of the Amigo Store collapsed under the
weight of torrential rain, trapping dozens and killing 14 people.
   Garza took control, coordinating initial rescue efforts and
later talking to officials from across the country who offered
equipment, food and medical supplies for the victims and their
families.
   Garza learned that the city lacked some heavy equipment and
communications gear, but said he was pleased that numerous private
companies offered their assistance almost immediately.
   This past week, while Hurricane Gilbert moved through the
Caribbean toward the Texas-Mexico border area, Garza and other city
officials prepared for the worst, although the storm ran inland to
the south in Mexico.
   The store roof collapse had one effect on the city's
preparations for the storm.
   ``What the roof collapse did was give us confidence in our
rescue procedures, that we could deal with a disaster as
devastating as a hurricane,'' Garza said. ``The roof collapse was
more reactionary and with the hurricane we did have some lead time
and we knew what we wanted to do.''

   Palestinians staged a general strike Saturday
to mark the sixth anniversary of a Beirut refugee camp massacre.
Israeli soldiers shot and killed two Palestinians and wounded 27,
Arab reports and hospital officials said.
   The army clamped curfews on 250,000 Palestinians in the occupied
Gaza Strip and arrested more than 100 alleged Arab ringleaders in
the occupied West Bank in a nighttime raid aimed at heading off the
disturbances.
   The 1.5 million Arabs of the occupied territories obeyed orders
issued by underground leaders to stage a general strike marking the
massacre of hundreds of Palestinians in Beirut's Sabra and Chatilla
refugee camps by Israeli-backed Christian militiamen in 1982.
   In a related development, Egypt marked the 10th anniversary of
the Camp David peace accords by again blaming ``Israeli
intransigence'' for the U.S.-brokered plan's failure to give the
Palestinians a voice in ruling themselves.
   Butros Ghali, minister of state for foreign affairs, said in
Cairo: ``Egypt had hoped that this anniversary would come at a time
when there was peace in the Middle East and Palestinians enjoyed
the right of self determination.
   ``But because of Israeli intransigence, and the continuation of
its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza strip, and its
continuation of repressive measures which stand against all
international laws as well as U.N. principles, the Palestinian
people still live under tragic circumstances.''
   The signing of the two accords, which laid down a framework that
led seven months later to the only peace treaty between Israel and
an Arab country, followed 13 days of negotiations at the U.S.
presidential retreat at Camp David, Maryland.
   Egypt considers that accord frozen since negotiations among
Israel, Egypt and the United States broke down in 1982.
   Ghali's statement noted the uprising that began in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza last Dec. 8. He said the Palestinians ``have
refused and rebelled against (Iraeli occupation) in a huge popular
uprising.''
   Palestinians Saturday stayed away from their jobs and kept
indoors except for knots of mostly young protesters who took to the
streets to burn tires and stone Israeli forces.
   Late Friday, the army, bracing for trouble, arrested over 100
Palestinians suspected of organizing demonstrations in Nablus,
Dahariya and Tulkarm in the occupied West Bank, a military
spokesman said.
   But the move did not prevent the most widespread and intense
violence in several weeks.
   In Jenin, Israeli soldiers opened fire after dozens of
Palestinian protesters blocked a main road with burning tires and
stones and threw rocks at military vehicles, Arab reporters said.
   The troops killed 18-year-old Emad Arkawi, Palestinian hospital
officials said.
   Arab reporters said Israeli troops also shot and killed
25-year-old Munjed Sarhan, from the village of Lubban Sharqiya.
Sarhan died immediately. His body was draped in a Palestinian flag
and buried, the reporters said.
   A military spokesman confirmed a dead Palestinian was brought to
Jenin hospital but said members of the family took the corpse for
burial and the army could not investigate the cause of death. The
spokesman said he was investigating the reported death in Lubban
Sharqiya.
   Saturday's fatalities brought the Palestinian death toll to 268
since the intefadeh, Arabic for uprising, broke out nine months
ago. Six Israelis also have died.
   Of the 27 Palestinian casualties reported Saturday, the army
confirmed only the wounding of one boy in Gaza.
   In Jenin, insurgents scrawled graffiti in Arabic and Hebrew that
said ``Death to the Jews'' and ``The End is Near.'' It was the
first time protesters have painted graffiti in Hebrew.

<HEAD>Construction Site Turns To Fish Grab, And Grabbers Get Ticketed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A highway construction site turned into a
fish grab when part of a bayou was drained, leaving a wide, muddy
hole where men with nets, buckets and spears sloshed around after
fish.
   But not for long: state wildlife and fisheries agents armed with
ticket books quickly put the brakes on the landlubber fishermen
Friday.
   ``The people who got citations were the ones in the water
actively chasing the fish,'' said Capt. Burton Wiley of the
wildlife department. ``We didn't write up anyone who was picking up
dead fish off the bank. If they want to scavenge, that's their
business.''
   Agents ticketed only people who caught gamefish such as bass or
perch from the water, letting them keep trash fish such as catfish,
gar and buffalo fish, he said.
   But men at the construction scene after the incident disputed
Wiley, saying the game wardens confiscated all of the fish,
including catfish and buffalo fish. And, they said, nobody was
allowed to pick up any of the fish at the site.
   ``I don't think it is right for us to have to pay a big fine for
catching fish that were going to die anyway,'' the Alexandria Daily
Town Talk quoted an unidentified participant as saying. The minimum
penalty for violating state gamefish regulations is $25.
   Wiley said the best thing for the contractor to have done with
unharmed fish stranded in the pool have been to dump them into the
bayou on the other side of the earthen dam.
   Project engineer Raymond Boniol of the State Department of
Transportation and Development said he was not present when the
tickets were issued and is not familiar with state laws governing
taking fish at a construciton site.
   ``That's not in the plans and specifications we drew up for this
project,'' he joked.

   A high school English class took on a task of epic
proportions when they decided to read aloud Homer's epic poems,
``Iliad'' and ``Odyssey.''
   It took them 29 straight hours.
   Carol Samson's class at Columbine High School started at 7 a.m.
Thursday and took turns reading every word of the ``Iliad.'' When
the students finished a little after 10 p.m., they started on the
``Odyssey,'' completing that work just before noon Friday.
   The marathon reading session developed after Samson told the 72
students that it took 31 hours for the Greeks to sing ``Iliad.''
Someone wondered how long it would take to read it, and Samson
suggested they find out.
   Samson had Greek food brought in for the reading, and the
students made paper Greek shields to add to the ambiance in the
classroom.
   Samson said her students didn't care for Achilles, a Greek
warrior and hero in ``Iliad.''
   ``He's proud and arrogant, and when he pulls back and won't
fight, they don't care for that,'' she said. ``One of the students
said, `You know, this Achilles is not a happy camper.''

   The Massie family has learned to step
lightly around the house since moving to the Black Hills in
southwestern South Dakota.
   It seems they have a den of rattlesnakes for neighbors.
   Charles and Ima Massie and their children moved into their rural
home in 1976, and ever since they've had periodic encounters with
snakes.
   ``We keep our eyes open all the time,'' Mrs. Massie said.
   Their first summer, they killed six snakes, she said, including
one that coiled up near a cupboard in the house.
   Through the years, rattlesnakes also have been spotted and
killed in the driveway, in grass, even coiled around the mailbox.
   State officials have inspected the home and determined that a
rattlesnake den was within slithering distance of the house, but
nobody had been able to find it, Mrs. Massie said.
   On Thursday, the Massies returned home to find their neighbor,
Annette Peldo, had just used her .22-caliber rifle to shoot a
rattlesnake that had been coiled near the Massies' backdoor.
   ``The snake had crawled around the corner of the house,'' Mrs.
Massie said. Peldo ``went home and got her .22, jumped up on the
car and shot at him until she killed him. It was really long, about
2{ to 3 feet, and really big.''

<HEAD>Creator Of Corvette Stingray Dies Of Heart Failure</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to include day of death.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BLOOMFIELD HILLS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William L. Mitchell, creator of
the now-classic Corvette Stingray and a former General Motors
executive, has died of heart failure at the age of 76.
   Ranked as one of the top 10 auto designers of all time by Car
and Driver magazine, Mitchell was a winter resident of North Palm
Beach, Fla. He died Monday in Michigan and was buried Friday in
Bloomfield Hills.
   A vice president of design at GM for 19 years, Mitchell molded
the appearance of hundreds of car models, including the 1963 Buick
Riviera and the 1970 Camaro. His designs were transformed into more
than 72.5 million automobiles, according to GM.
   The Stingray was introduced in 1963, when the Corvette was about
10 years old, and quickly became the dream of sports-car lovers.
   Mitchell told The Post of West Palm Beach, Fla., last year of
the genesis of his idea for a body design that became the
fiberglass-body Stingray.
   ``I bought a Corvette chassis for one dollar,'' he said. ``I
created the Stingray. I wanted it to look like no other car. I
wanted to race.''
   GM officials had stipulated that Mitchell remove all company
logos and keep the car off GM property while he tinkered with it,
Mitchell said.
   He was quick to complain about today's cars.
   ``I don't like the new Corvette,'' he told the newspaper. ``I
think it's very bland. The emblem looks like a cigar wrapper. It
has no classic look.''
   And most new cars ``all look like a bar of soap ... they lack
definition,'' he said.
   Mitchell joined the GM design staff in 1935, and a year later
was promoted to chief designer for the Cadillac Studio. There he
created the 1938 Cadillac Sixty Special, the first smaller,
personal luxury car.
   He retired from GM in 1965.
   Survivors include his wife Marian, three daughters and four
grandsons.

<DATELINE>BEIRA, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Saturday blessed
wheelchair-bound victims of Mozambique's 13-year civil war and
noted improvements in the Marxist government's relations with the
Roman Catholic Church.
   On the last portion of a 10-day, five-nation tour of southern
Africa, the pope flew from the capital, Maputo, to Beira, an Indian
Ocean city of 300,000 isolated except by air and water because of
intense guerrilla activity in the region.
   Beira, the country's second-largest city after Maputo, has been
plagued by almost daily cuts in electricity and water shortages
caused by sabotage from anti-Marxist rebels of the Mozambique
National Resistance movement.
   Protected from a blazing sun by a thatched altar shaped like a
native hut, the pope delivered a Mass at the edge of a golf course
where the grass had been cut for the first time in 14 years, local
officials said. Security surrounding the pope was tight.
   ``The picture frequently described by missionaries who live with
you is not without shadows, due to the prevailing situation of
insecurity, which ... generates violence, anxiety and distress,
leaving limited space for freedom,'' the pope said.
   The civil war, which began after Mozambique gained independence
from Portugal in 1975, has forced about 1 million Mozambicans to
flee to neighboring countries. Relief agencies estimate 6 million
of Mozambique's 14.5 million populace require food aid.
   At the open-air Mass before 50,000 people, the pope blessed a
tractor driver who lost his legs when his vehicle hit a landmine
and a young man whose legs were paralyzed after he was hit by
bazooka fire in a rebel ambush.
   Port and rail links from Beira reach into landlocked African
nations and have been a frequent target of attack by rebels, known
by their Portuguese acronym Renamo.
   The Mozambican government has been openly hostile to churches in
the past, but now is working to improve strained relations.
   The government recently returned church-run schools and
hospitals that it said were mistakenly confiscated when many such
institutions were nationalized. The rector of Beira seminary,
Manuel Machabo, said the government returned two churches in his
area that were being used as a warehouse and a gymnasium.
   In an apparent reference to anti-church government policies, the
pontiff said social ills develop when men begin ``shutting
themselves off to God.''
   But the pope acknowledged the improvements, saying, ``I would
like to recognize also the efforts that are being made at this
moment for the difficulties to be overcome.''
   Life for Beira's residents remains difficult. Communications are
poor, stores lack many basic foods, transportation is difficult and
residents almost never travel outside the city for fear of rebel
attacks.
   ``But life is improving,'' says Maria do Ceu, a Portuguese nun
who teaches languages at a local school. ``Five years ago a piece
of meat was an event, now we have it from time to time.''
   Later, John Paul spoke to about 5,000 people at the airport in
the northern city of Nampula, where he heard more horror stories
about the civil war. The Portuguese archbishop of Nampula, Manuel
Vieira Pinto, said rebels killed 8,000 civilians and plundered
about 600 towns in the past five years.
   John Paul also met with clergy in Nampula before flying back to
Maputo, where he was scheduled to speak Sunday.
   Some Mozambican bishops have urged the government to talk with
the rebels. But President Joaquim Chissano's government has refused
to negotiate and has criticized the bishops for advocating talk
with ``armed bandits.''
   The rebels have been accused of widespread civiian atrocities, a
charge they deny. The U.S. State Department, in an April report,
estimated the rebels have killed 100,000 civilians in the last two
to three years.
   The rebels earlier announced a cease-fire during the pope's
visit and wished the pontiff a good stay.
   Chissano met the pope last May in Rome, but the Vatican appears
to be holding off the establishment of diplomatic relations as an
incentive to advancing the peace process.
   Mozambique, ravaged by drought in recent years, receives most of
its military assistance from the Soviet Union, but increasingly has
been making overtures to Western nations. The United States is the
largest donor of food aid in Mozambique, and Britain has been
providing military training.

<HEAD>Sandinistas And Rebels To Resume Peace Talks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Sandinista government and
U.S.-backed rebels plan to resume talks Monday after a three-month
stalemate in their search for an end to seven years of war.
   Both sides called the planned two-day conference in Guatemala a
preliminary step toward reopening the high-level talks that broke
off June 9.
   The left-wing Sandinistas and rebels, known as Contras, signed
an accord March 23 to seek a negotiated settlement to the conflict
the government says has claimed the lives of 28,000 Nicaraguans.
   The agreement called on the rebels to lay down their arms in
exchange for democratic reforms. Shortly before the talks broke off
in June, the Sandinistas proposed a timetable for disarmament and
political reforms.
   But the Contras rejected the plan, saying it did not go far
enough. They insisted on the immediate release of political
prisoners, disbanding of the supreme court and full democratic
guarantees.
   A March 21 agreement to suspend offensive military operations
remains in place but both sides accuse the other of violating the
truce.
   The Defense Ministry issues frequent communiques claiming Contra
ambushes of government forces. Bosco Matamoros, spokesman for the
rebels, said recently Sandinista troops attacked Contra positions
93 times in August.
   Earlier this month the Sandinistas proposed preliminary talks in
Guatemala to be followed by a conference in Managua.
   The Contras initially rejected the suggestion, saying the
government had restricted their movements during four earlier talks
in Managua and they would not return to the capital. They also
wanted Nicaragua's opposition parties to participate in the next
round of talks.
   Last weekm the rebels added a new condition. They demanded the
release of more than 40 opposition leaders arrested by police
during a demonstration on July 10.
   Matamoros recently proposed Sept. 26 for the next high-level
talks to be held in a still-to-be decided location.
   The Sandinistas maintain the talks should be held in Managua and
that only the government and the Contras take part.
   Overt U.S. military aid to the rebels ended Feb. 29 and the
Contras have few bargaining chips left.
   Over the past four months, most of the rebel forces fled from
Nicaragua back to base camps inside Honduras where they receive
non-lethal aid suplied by the United States.
   Contra sources say only 2,000 fighters remain inside Nicaragua,
with more than 9,000 in base camps near the border in eastern
Honduras.
   The rebels, saying the Sandinistas still get large amounts of
Soviet-supplied war materiel, are seeking renewed U.S. military aid.
   Both sides are anxiously awaiting the U.S. presidential
elections in November. The Sandinistas hope for a Democratic
victory by Michael Dukakis, who opposes more Contra aid, while the
Republican contender, Vice President George Bush, has supported aid
to the rebels.

   One of the worst growing seasons in recent
memory will mean a smaller-than-usual apple crop in the nation's
second-largest apple-producing state, growers said.
   The effects of late spring rain showers just when pollination
began and a dry summer is coming into focus even as the state's
major apple variety, the McIntosh, is being harvested in orchards
across New York this weekend.
   ``It's too early to tell any numbers, but this year's crop is
definitely down,'' said Lee Peters, a vice president of Fowler
Brother's Orchards in Wolcott.
   Statewide, production this year is estimated to be about 2
million bushels down from last year's 18.8 million bushels,
according to industry figures. It's also the smallest apple crop
since 1972.
   Raymond Lemka, a fruit grower in East Greenbush, said he was
just beginning his harvest, and his crop is looking farily good.
But there is usually a 10-day period in which McIntosh apples can
be picked, he said, and any extended period of rain would be yet
another setback.
   According to the National Weather Service in Albany, a cold
front was headed into the state and showers are likely.
   In Washington state, the nation's leading apple producer,
growers have largely avoided the drought.
   A July forecast for the Washington fall apple crop calls for
total production about one-third less than the record 1987 crop,
but that's largely because trees naturally bear less fruit the year
after a big crop. The total would be about the same as the 1986
crop.

   Wondering what to wear isn't a worry
for one group of conventioneers in the northern Adriatic resort of
Rovinj, where nudists from 21 nations kicked off their annual
congress on Saturday.
   About 500 delegates from the International Naturists Federation
met in the resort town on the Istrian peninsula for the three-day
gathering, the news agency Tanjug reported.
   Delegates are from throughout Europe, the United States and
Canada, it said.
   Among the agenda items is a round-table discussion on
``Naturism, Tourism and Leisure Time,'' the Tanjug said.
   This is the second time Yugoslavia has hosted an international
nudist meeting. In 1972 the European naturist center of Koversada
hosted the 13th world congress of nudists.

<HEAD>Iceland's Government Resigns in Dispute Over Economic Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REYKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 15-month-old coalition government
of Prime Minister Thorsteinn Palsson resigned Saturday night after
failing to agree on a program to deal with the country's acute
economic problems.
   President Vigdis Finnbogadottir was expected to decide within a
day whether to call new elections or to ask a leader of one of the
three coalition parties to try to form a government.
   Iceland's fishing industry, which produces 70 percent of the
North Atlantic island nation's export income, has suffered heavy
losses.
   The economic crisis became so severe that on May 14, two days
before he was to have left for Washington, Palsson postponed an
official visit to the United States. He subsequently made the trip
on Aug. 9.
   Also, on May 14, the government temporarily suspended currency
trading because of a drain on foreign reserves caused by
speculation the currency, the crown, would be devalued by 20
percent.
   Leaders of the fishing industry had demanded that sharp a
devaluation, which would have made the prices of exports cheaper
and more competitive but would have increased the prices of imports.
   The economic package under discussion included a 6 percent
devaluation and a new tax package.
   After weeks of negotiation, Palsson of the Party of
Independence, his Social Democratic Finance Minister Jon Ealdvin
Hannibalsson and Foreign Minister Steingrimur Hermannsson of the
Farmer's Party failed to agree.
   The three coalition parties, which formed the government in June
1987, have said they did not want new elections, but the Women's
Ticket party is reported to favor elections because opinion polls
show it gaining popularity.
   Hannibalsson and Hermannsson said Saturday they had been
discussing economic measures, were close to agreement and were
seeking talks with opposition parties to see if they could gather
enough support if either should be asked to form a new government.
   Under a North Atlantic Treaty Organization agreement, Iceland,
with a population of 250,000, is the site of a major U.S. air base
at Keflavik, 25 miles southwest of the capital Reykjavik.

   A sports bookmaking operation
that took in more than $1 million a day in receipts was broken up
Saturday by Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies, and four people
were arrested, authorities said.
   Deputies raided two residences at 9:30 a.m. and seized
computers, television monitors and two wire service teletype
machines, said Deputy Detta Roberts.
   The raid followed a five-month investigation, she said.
   ``The daily receipts were in the millions,'' she said. ``This
was a pretty big operation.''
   The teletypes carried a sports report put out by Sports Network
of Huntington Valley, Pa.
   General Manager Bill Rohrer described the service as a
comprehensive package of sports scores, stories and statistics
geared to broadcasters. He said private individuals also use the
information.
   Arrested for investigation of conspiracy for bookmaking were
Clarence Austin, 47, Fred Cohen, 55, Mark Mitzenmacher, 28, and
Chas Rizzuto, 43, said Ms. Roberts.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis, declaring
Republican George Bush has provided ``zero protection for the
environment,'' proposed Saturday elevating the Environmental
Protection Agency to a Cabinet department.
   ``And the first secretary of the Environment is going to be as
committed to protecting the environment as George Bush has been to
neglecting it,'' the Democratic presidential candidate told a
cheering crowd of campaign workers.
   Dukakis drew a roar of approval from several hundred volunteers
when he referred to rhetorical flubs by the Republican ticket.
   ``Dan Quayle doesn't know what century he's in and George Bush
can't remember the Pledge of Allegiance,'' he said.
   From California, Dukakis flew to Washington, D.C., to share the
spotlight at the annual Congressional Black Caucus dinner with
Jesse Jackson and to plead for high turnout among black voters,
acknowledging blacks will be essential to a Democratic victory.
   ``Our adversaries are not just George Bush and Dan Quayle,''
Dukakis said in prepared remarks. ``Our adversaries are despair and
resignation and indifference and complacency.''
   He struck several themes important to blacks, including civil
rights, law enforcement, increasing the minimum wage, support for
black colleges and sanctions against South Africa's repressive
apartheid regime.
   Dukakis laid out his plan for a new Cabinet department at a
rally in a union hall at which his campaign was signing up precinct
workers for the drive to capture California's 47 electoral votes _
the biggest single prize on Election Day.
   With politicians and pollsters agreed that the fight for
California's critical electoral votes was currently a dead heat,
Dukakis was recruiting thousands of precinct workers to his cause.
   At a series of meetings across the state, similar to the one at
which Dukakis spoke, the campaign hoped to sign up 5,000 precinct
captains. The process will be repeated on upcoming weekends in an
effort to have a worker in each of the state's 23,000 precincts.
   The environment is a major issue in California and one of the
most volatile aspects is the controversy over offshore oil drilling.
   Following Dukakis' announcement, National Wildlife Federation
President Jay D. Hair called it ``exactly the kind of presidential
leadership needed to address some of the most complex and important
human and environmental health issues before our society.''
   While the Reagan administration has advocated pushing ahead with
drilling off the California coast, Bush said last spring that he
favored a delay in approving pending leases to determine if they
were environmentally sound.
   ``He's done more somersaults than an Olympic gymnast on the
subject of offshore drilling off the California coast,'' said
Dukakis. ``When he's in Texas _ he's for it. When he's in
California, he says _ well, maybe not.
   ``My friends, we need a president who won't change his position
with the time zone.''
   ``There'll be no drilling in Santa Monica Bay,'' he pledged.
``And we're going to send the administration's five-year oil and
gas leasing plan back to the drawing board.''
   Dukakis ridiculed Bush's record on the environment, saying ``he
calls for `zero tolerance' against those who poison our water with
toxic chemicals, but for seven and a half years, he's provided zero
protection for the environment of this country.''
   He said that as chairman of the White House task force on
regulatory reform Bush ``diluted, delayed and destroyed scores of
regulations to preserve the environment.''
   In a fact sheet distributed by the Dukakis staff, it was noted
that the EPA budget already is larger than those for the State and
Commerce departments and that it employs more people than the
departments of Housing and Urban Development and Education.
   The cost was described as ``insignificant,'' perhaps as little
as a few hundred thousand dollars.
   Dukakis spoke in front of banner that read, ``Orange County
Volunteer Victory Team.'' The volunteers all received red, white
and blue Dukakis for president signs and were told to put them up
in front of their homes and urge neighbors to do the same.
   ``Don't let anybody tell you this campaign is just television,''
he told the volunteers.
   But the Dukakis forces have an uphill fight in Orange County, a
Republican bastion. The best Democrats hope for in the area is to
hold down the GOP majority to a level they can overcome with votes
from heavily Democratic areas of the state.

<HEAD>Iraq Claims It Resettled Kurds In Modern Villages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAMARNI, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq has transformed the face of its
northern Kurdish region with battles and bulldozers, and an
official said Saturday that residents of hundreds of razed villages
were moved to new, more modern towns.
   The government, which has accused of attacking Kurdish
separatist rebels with chemical weapons, flew foreign reporters by
helicopter to this devastated village and over much of the region
Friday and Saturday.
   Guides ate grapes growing in one area allegedly attacked by
chemical weapons to support the government's denial it used poison
gas during its recent offensive against the Kurds.
   Rebel leaders claim 4,300 Kurds died in Iraqi gas attacks.
   Many other areas visible from the air have been bulldozed in
what officials describe as a plan to concentrate Iraqis throughout
the country in towns more easily served with power, water and other
amenities.
   ``We are bringing together the families of the villages'' into
new towns of 2,000 to 3,000 people, Namuk Raqib Sorji, the
provincial governor, told reporters in Dihok, 210 miles south of
the Turkish border and 250 miles north of Baghdad.
   ``The villages are isolated and far-flung,'' he said. ``It is
very difficult to bring services to people.''
   Dihok is one of three governorates in Iraq's Kurdish region,
where about 3.5 million Kurds live.
   ``About 200 small villages in Dihok alone'' have been
eliminated, the provincial governor, Sorji told reporters.
   Bamarni, 12 miles south of the Turkish border, fell victim to
the Iraqi army's massive thrust against Kurdish rebels, who had
been supported by Iran. The offensive began shortly after a
U.N.-sponsored cease-fire in the eight-year-old Iran-Iraq war went
into effect on Aug. 20.
   A bulldozer stood on a hill overlooking the smashed concrete and
mud-brick houses. Grape vines still flourished near broken bicycle
frames, old shoes and an abandoned baby doll. Fire had scorched the
orchard on the town's edge. There were no residents.
   Iraqi government escorts took reporters to what they identified
as the Balisian Valley, 95 miles southeast of Bamarni. They said it
is where the rebels claimed gas attacks occurred, but there was no
obvious evidence of that _and no people either.
   The United States and several other western European states have
urged the United Nations to dispatch a team to Iraq to investigate
charges of poison gas attacks but Baghdad has refused.
   On a 90-mile flight from Sulaymaniyah to Arbil, geometric grids
of new concrete dwellings rose along highways or on the outskirts
of large towns.
   Western diplomats say Iraq appeared to be trying to end decades
of simmering rebellion among Kurds by eliminating remote village
sanctuaries and putting the general population into more easily
controlled centers.
   But the Dihok governor said the program was ``a general
decision'' applied across the country, although outside observers
have not noted movements on a similar scale outside the Kurdish
region.
   Tens of thousands of Kurds from villages have fled into Turkey
and Iran during the latest fighting.
   In another development Iraq's information minister, Latif
Nassayif Jassim, said Saturday Israel would ``pay very dearly'' if
it attacked targets on the pretext they were chemical weapons
plants, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
   In June 1981, Israel carried out what it called a pre-emptive
air strike against the French-built reactor west of Baghdad to
prevent Iraq from developing an atomic bomb.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people formed a human chain at a
nuclear power plant in the Baltic republic of Lithuania on Saturday
to protest the facility's threat to the environment, Tass reported.
   The official news agency said people from all over Lithuania
locked arms at the Ignalina Atomic Electric Station in the north
east of the republic.
   Fire broke out Sept. 5 in a control cable of the No. 2 reactor,
but no radiation was released, Tass reported at the time.
   During Saturday's demonstration, people cleaned up the area
around the plant located near a lake and planted trees, Tass said.
Some of the protesters were invited to tour the plant.
   Tass did not give a precise number of demonstrators, saying only
that there were thousands, or give their demands.
   The demonstration was part of a growing environmental campaign
in the Soviet Union. Soviets are increasingly taking advantage of
Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or
openness, to speak out.
   Gorbachev himself has said the government should pay more
attention to preserving the environment and earlier this year
created an agency to oversee environmental protection.
   Concern over the dangers of nuclear power heightened in the
Soviet Union and worldwide after the April 26, 1986, explosion at
the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the Ukraine. The accident sent
a cloud of radioactivity worldwide and killed 31 people.
   Eight U.S. senators and 20 congressmen sent letters Thursday to
U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz urging him to discuss the
Ignalina plant's problems with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnandze, a U.S.-based group of Lithuanian emigres reported.
Lithuanian Catholic Religious Aid said the letters call for an
international commission to investigate the plant's safety.
   Shultz is to meet Shevardnadze in Washington on Sept. 22-23.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis ridiculed Republican George Bush's
claim to be an environmentalist, accusing the vice president
Saturday of flip-flops on the issue of offshore oil drilling and
comparing him to former Interior Secretary James Watt.
   The Massachusetts governor, speaking to campaign workers in
Anaheim, Calif., also said he would elevate the Environmental
Protection Agency to a Cabinet-level department.
   ``The first secretary of the environment is going to be as
committed to protecting the environment as George Bush has been to
neglecting it,'' Dukakis said.
   Dukakis was attacking Bush on one of the issues the Republican
presidential nominee has staked out for himself, having declared
last month at an appearance in Michigan that he was a lifelong
environmentalist.
   ``The next thing you know, we'll be hearing that James Watt and
Anne Gorsuch (Burford) and Rita Lavelle are environmentalists
too,'' Dukakis said.
   Watt, who served as President Reagan's first interior secretary,
was a favorite target for attack by environmental groups because of
his support for opening up previously protected land for commercial
use. Mrs. Burford was in charge of the EPA until 1983. Ms. Lavelle,
who headed the agency's toxic waste cleanup program, served three
months in jail for lying to Congress.
   ``The sight of George Bush campaigning on the coast and talking
about his commitment to clean water reminds me of the old saying
from television detective shows: They always return to the scene of
the crime,'' Dukakis said.
   Bush, meanwhile, on Saturday was wooing the immigrant vote often
sought by Dukakis, who seldom fails to mention his Greek-born
parents.
   The vice president spoke briefly to a group of 174 new citizens
from 62 countries at a naturalization ceremony in Washington. Bush
stood in for Reagan at the event, staged by the Commission on the
Bicentennial of the Constitution to commemorate the 201st
anniversary of the signing of the Constitution in Philadelphia.
   ``We Americans have always thought of ourselves as special, as a
light shining out to the world,'' Bush told the new citizens after
they were given the oath of citizenship by former Supreme Court
chief justice Warren E. Burger. ``All of us, from the newest
citizen to the oldest, must participate in the running of this
country.''
   Bush's remarks were low-key and non-partisan, but the event gave
him a chance to appear before television cameras flanked by the
flag and a replica of the Liberty Bell and to recite the Pledge of
Allegiance, which has become a mainstay of his campaign.
   Dukakis, speaking later to a crowd at the Congressional Black
Caucus legislative conference in Washington, said the election's
stakes are particularly high for blacks.
   ``This election is a struggle for the future of America,'' he
said in prepared remarks. ``It's a struggle for the soul of
America. It's a struggle we must win, and I need your help to do
it.''
   Dukakis' unity message was designed to help heal what some
regard as continued divisions within the Democratic party since he
defeated Jesse Jackson for the party's nomination.
   ``Together, we're going to build an America where we aim high
again,'' he said, mentioning the issues of civil rights
enforcement, judicial appointments, full employment, the war
against drugs and sanctions against South Africa's racist
government.
   In California, Dukakis accused Bush of standing by and doing
nothing while the administration tried to dismantle the Superfund
program for cleaning up toxic wastes. He also said Bush supported
Reagan's veto of the Clean Water Act and has ``done more
somersaults than an Olympic gymnast'' on the question of offshore
drilling.
   Bush also came under attack Saturday for his role in leading the
administration's efforts to stem the flow of illegal drugs into the
United States. He has said that he would appoint his vice
presidential running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, to a similar
responsibility if the Republican ticket wins the election.
   Speaking to a partisan crowd in the Florida panhandle,
Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen said Bush
``wants to pass the torch of failure on to the junior senator from
Indiana.''
   Quayle, meanwhile, addressed a crowd of picnickers who gathered
in the pouring rain at the farm of Sen. John Warner, R-Va., near
Middleburg.
   ``I call this kind of weather Dukakis weather _ gloomy skies and
dark clouds,'' said Quayle, speaking into a microphone poking out
of two bales of hay set up in front of Warner's house.
   But the strongest attack came from Rep. Ron Coleman, D-Texas,
who delivered the Democrats' response to Reagan's weekly radio
address with pointed references to Quayle's decision to serve
public information officer in the Indiana National Guard during the
Vietnam war.
   Coleman questioned Quayle's fitness to lead the nation's war on
drugs.
   ``How can he be put in charge of this war when he wouldn't fight
in the last one? We still haven't forgotten the last time he was
given the opportunity to carry a rifle for his country,'' Coleman
said. ``This is a fellow who sat out the last war typing press
releases in Indiana.''

<HEAD>Storm Spawns Tornadoes In Texas, Rain in Plains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Hurricane Gilbert produced dozens of tornadoes in eastern Texas
on Saturday as it weakened and was downgraded to a tropical
depression, and it continued to push rain and thunderstorms across
the southern Plains.
   Eight tornadoes touched down in the San Antonio, Texas, area and
three near Del Rio, Texas. Twisters also touched down near the
Texas communities of Devine, Jourdanton, Fischer, Sattler and Brady.
   Saturday afternoon, Gilbert's center was about 230 miles
west-southwest of Brownsville, Texas, on the Texas-Mexico border.
   Rain and thunderstorms extended across the southern Plains and
into eastern Arkansas, northern Mississippi and northern Alabama,
the Appalachians, from Florida across New York state and western
New England.
   Rain also was scattered over northwest Montana.
   Rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included 2.10
inches at Bluefield, W.Va.; 1.96 inches at the Air Force Base near
San Antonio; 0.84 of an inch at Greer, S.C.; and 0.83 of an inch at
Hickory, N.C.
   A winter storm watch was posted for Saturday night and Sunday
for western and central Montana. Cold rain was expected to become
locally heavy snow in the mountains and passes. As much as 8 inches
of snow was expected over the southwest and central mountains by
Sunday, with up to a foot of new snow in the higher mountains.
   The cold and rain also were expected to reach across northern
Wyoming and snowfall of 2 to 5 inches was possible in the mountains
of northern Wyoming, including the Yellostone National Park area.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 42
degrees at both Cutbank and Great Falls, Mont., to 96 degrees at
Palm Springs, Calif. The nation's low Saturday was 22 degrees at
Gunnison, Colo.
   Sunday's forecast was for rain and thunderstorms from the
eastern two-thirds of Texas across Oklahoma and eastern Kansas,
from northern Arkansas across Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana,
northwest Kentucky, western Tennessee, northern Mississippi,
Alabama, Georgia and northwest Florida. Showers also were expected
from Maine across east-central New England and thunderstorms were
to extend from Montana across Wyoming into the western portion of
the northern Plains, with rain becoming snow in the mountains.
   High temperatures were to be in the 40s and 50s over the
northern half of the Rockies and the upper Missouri Valley. Highs
in the 60s and 70s were forecast from New England across New
Jersey, the northern Appalachians, the remainder of the upper
Midwest and Rockies and the Pacific Northwest, with 70s along the
California coast. Temperatures were to reach the low 90s in
Florida, southern Mississippi and Louisiana, and from southwest
Texas through the desert Southwest, with 80s elsewhere.

<HEAD>Rebels Obstructing Relief Supplies to Southern Sudan, Government
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rebel attacks are preventing convoys of
relief supplies from reaching the famine-stricken south, a
provincial governor was quoted Saturday as saying.
   The Sudan Peoples' Liberation Army is ``obstructing relief
operations to southern Sudan and that has stopped the works of the
Red Cross there,'' Mauris Lawya, governor of Equatoria Province,
said in a statement to the Sudanese daily Al-Nahar.
   Lawya said rebel attacks during the past few days forced an
army-escorted convoy of 912 trucks headed for the provincial
capital Juba, 750 Miles south of to return back to Yie, 70 miles to
the northwest.
   Lawya said only 96 out of 1,080 supply trucks from neighboring
Uganda were able to make the journey to Juba, 750 miles south of
the capital Khartoum, because of such attacks.
   The rebels believe the government might use relief convoys as a
cover to move military reinforcements into areas under guerrilla
control.
   Meanwhile, the rebel group claimed in a radio broadcast
monitored Saturday that it captured Katre, a garrison town 20 miles
from the border with Uganda and warned aircraft not to fly over
southern Sudan without its permission.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nairobi, also called on civilians to
evacuate Juba and nine other southern Sudan towns.
   Pacifico Lado Loleik, who represents South Sudan in the
sovereign council, which acts as head of state, said earlier this
week that rebel attacks are stopping food trucks from reaching
Malakal, an Upper Nile city 425 miles south of Khartoum.
   Officials have said thousands of people in the south have died
and tens of thousands more may also perish without food shipments.
   The rebels, mostly Christians and animists, are seeking more
autonomy as well as economic and administrative reforms from the
Moslem majority government in the north.

<TEXT>
   China's Premier Li Peng said Saturday that China
and the Soviet Union could hold their first summit in three decades
if lower-level talks succeed.
   China's highest-ranking government official also denied strongly
that the Chinese leadership is divided over how to proceed with the
nation's economic reforms, now riddled with inflation, overspending
and corruption.
   Li spoke in an interview with The Associated Press board of
directors and executives. It was China's most positive response yet
to Soviet calls for an improvement in ties.
   On Friday, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev called for ``full
normalization'' between the two Communist giants. Moscow and
Beijing have been politically at odds since an ideological falling
out in 1960.
   Li said he welcomed such a call.
   In a 40-minute interview at the Diaoyutai state guesthouse, Li
stressed that Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, often
regarded as Li's political rival, has been a full participant in
recent decisions to slow down reforms.
   ``Rumors going around the world'' of a serious rift in the
leadership are groundless, Li said. Minor differences over policies
are ``normal phenomena,'' he said. ``Our top leadership is united.''
   Li said China ``would like very much to normalize our relations
with the Soviet Union.''
   He noted that China and the Soviet Union share 4,300 miles of
common border, ``so the strain on relations between the two
countries is not in the interest of China because we need to
modernize our country in a peaceful environment.''
   He also emphasized that China has no intention of becoming an
ally of the Soviet Union or returning to the relationship of the
1950s, when Moscow acted as a big brother to the fledgling
Communist government in Beijing.
   The premier also refuted the idea that better Chinese-Soviet
ties would be a threat to the West.
   ``Let me tell you a secret,'' he said with a smile. ``Recently
when your Defense Secretary (Frank) Carlucci was here I asked him
some questions about the Soviet military strength and he told me a
lot of things I did not know.''
   Li also left open the possibility of the first Chinese-Soviet
summit since Nikita Khrushchev met Mao Tse-tung in 1959.
   Gorbachev, in his speech in Siberia Friday, renewed overtures
for a summit he first made in Vladivostok in 1986.
   Although Li noted China's longstanding ``three obstacles'' to a
Chinese-Soviet summit, he seemed to play down the differences while
emphasizing that China ``would like very much to normalize
relations.''
   The three obstacles are the Soviet troop presence in
Afghanistan, the nine-year occupation of Cambodia by Soviet-allied
Vietnam, and the heavy Soviet troop presence on its border with
China.
   Progress recently has been made in all three areas.
   He said Chinese-Soviet talks on Cambodia in Beijing last month
had ``reached certain results.''
   He said some disagreements remain on other issues, but ``once
there is further agreement the subject of a summit meeting will be
placed on the agenda.''
   Li tried to dispel reports of dissension within China's
political ranks by explaining that all top decisions are made by
the Communist Party Politburo, which is headed by party chief Zhao
and includes Li.
   He said decisions made in the past month to calm consumers and
cool off the economy, including a ban on further price increases
this year, were made ``under the directorship of General Secretary
Zhao Ziyang and some were proposed by him himself.''
   Some Western and Hong Kong reports have speculated that Zhao,
who advocates bold policies of introducing market-oriented reforms,
is in trouble because of the current serious side-effects of the
reforms.
   Li said the reforms, initiated by senior leader Deng Xiaoping 10
years ago, will proceed, but there is a need to stabilize an
economy battered by a 20-percent inflation rate, rising government
deficits and uncontrolled spending on public projects.
   The Associated Press delegation was led by William J. Keating,
AP board chairman and chief executive officer of the Detroit
Newspaper Agency, and AP President and General Manager Louis D.
Boccardi.

<HEAD>Judges Rule Public Interest Lawyers Can Collect Prevailing Rates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court said lawyers who
handle so-called public interest cases at low rates can charge the
government the higher ``prevailing market rate'' for their work if
they win in a suit challenging federal policy.
   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, in an
8-3 decision Friday, ruled that public interest lawyers are
entitled to collect fees at the often-higher, prevailing rate when
they successfully challenge federal government policies.
   Under federal laws, the government must pay the legal fees of
the winning side in a variety of challenges to federal statutes, a
system designed to encourage private initiatives to enforce the
law. The government, however, has challenged the size of the fees.
   Judges dissenting from the appellate decision asserted that the
ruling overturns a rational and efficient method for determining
fees, established by a ruling in 1984, and will ``create an
enormous administrative burden for this court.''
   A former assistant U.S. attorney who was involved in
establishing the rule that the government would reimburse lawyers
at the rate normally charged by their law firms said the ruling
would create chaos.
   ``How can you determine what the market price is?'' he asked,
speaking on condition that he not be identified. ``Every law firm
charges a different hourly fee.''
   The case arose after four lawyers successfully sued the Interior
Department, challenging laws that they said allowed huge mining
companies to skirt environmental standards. The lawyers represented
Save Our Cumberland Mountains Inc., a citizens group based in
Tennessee.
   A U.S. district judge awarded them just under $200,000 in legal
fees for the four-year legal battle, according to one of the
lawyers. The government appealed.
   A three-judge appellate panel ruled that the two lawyers should
be compensated at a lower rate of $100 an hour, finding that the
district court judge had erred in using the prevailing market rate
to determine the legal fees.
   U.S. Appeals Court Judge David B. Sentelle, in his opinion for
the majority, said the three-judge panel's ruling was
``inconsistent with the intent of Congress in enacting fee award
statutes'' and with Supreme Court rulings. From now on, he said,
awards would be based on ``the prevailing market rate.''

<TEXT>
   A group of religious U.S. peace activists arrived
here Saturday after being expelled from Honduras, where they were
held in a cell for four days after protests at the American embassy
and a U.S. air base.
   Members of Project Independence, who arrived at Miami
International Airport, said they were protesting U.S. intervention
in Central America, and that colleagues in Guatemala would continue
to protest.
   They said four other members of the interdenominational group,
who chained themselves to the U.S. embassy gate in Guatemala City
on Wednesday, have been joined by ``scores'' of Guatemalan citizens
each day for prayers and protest songs.
   ``They will stay chained up until they are forcibly removed or
until the seventh day of their action,'' said Andres Thomas, 27, a
seminary student at the Divinity School of Howard University in
Washington.
   He said the group in Guatemala City also will fast until the end
of the protest.
   Thomas was one of 13 Project Independence activists detained in
Honduras on Wednesday and deported Saturday for separate protests
in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital, and at the Palmerola air base
40 miles outside the city.
   The four protesters in Guatemala City were identified in a
Project Independence news release as Charlie Liteky, 57, a former
Roman Catholic priest; Dale Ashera-Davis, 34, member of a religious
community in Baltimore, Md.; former Swarthmore College Dean John
Schuchardt, 49, and Sara Story, 26, a legal researcher from
Washington.
   According to Patricia McCallum, 47, a doctoral student at
Harvard University's Divinity School who took part in the
Guatemalan protests, Project Independence staged the demonstrations
to coincide with the anniversary of the date in 1821 when Central
America gained independence from Spain.
   ``We put our bodies in front of the path of death'' that project
members regard as the fruit of Central American policies of the
Reagan administration, Ms. McCallum said.
   The project was brought into being ``to condemn the long and
continuing history of U.S. military and CIA-backed intervention in
all the Central American countries,'' said a statement issued at an
airport news conference.
   Ms. McCallum said the group was detained for three days in a
cell measuring 6-by-14 feet, where two U.S. consular officers
visited them.
   Members of the group said Honduran guards told the protesters
their case was being handled by U.S. authorities.
   ``It was clear to us our destiny was in the hands of the U.S.
embassy,'' Ms. McCallum said.
   Mark Fryer, 31, a member of the Catholic Worker Movement from
West Creek, N.J., said the group received privileged treatment at
the prison. Guards were friendly and food and newspapers were
brought to the protesters.
   But he charged that Guatemalan prisoners down the corridor went
without food for seven days and could be heard screaming under
torture.
   ``It was horrible to know that this (alleged torture) was just
one of the results of U.S. government policy in Central America,''
Thomas said.
   The group identified the other members as: Mary Jane Helrich,
70, Newport, N.Y.; Teri Allen, 30, and John Bach, 41, both of
Hartford, Conn.; Kathy Boylan, 45, Wyandanch, N.Y.; Art Laffin, 34,
and Elmer Maas, 53, both of New Haven, Conn.; Gail Presby, 29, New
York City; Bob Simpson, 67, Philadephia; Brian Terrell, 32, Maloy,
Iowa; and Judith Williams, 49, Madison, Conn.

   Thousands of revelers jammed the
downtown area Saturday to soak up the suds and kick off
Oktoberfest, the world's biggest and best-known beer bash.
   Officials estimate more 6 million people will attend the
2-week-long binge of hoopla and are expected to consume nearly 1.4
million gallons of the brew.
   The annual event draws visitors from both home and abroad to
savor the traditional Octoberfest fare _ hamhocks, sauerkraut,
grilled chicken and sausages _ washed down with glasses of beer to
the sound of blaring Bavarian folk music.
   The festival got its start as a wedding party when on Oct. 12,
1810, when Crown Prince Ludwig, who later became King Ludwig I of
Bavaria, married Princess Therese von Saxony-Hilburgshausen. That
five-day celebration was held on the same patch of ground where the
event is held today.
   During the early Octoberfests, the royal family paid the costs
of the festival, but that tradition has long since faded and
visitors are paying record prices for their brew this year.
   According to festival organizers, a liter of beer will cost on
average about $3.70.
   Organizers said they expected consumption to equal or top last
year's figures. Last year, revelers drank 1,396,720 gallons of brew
and consumed a total of 732,859 grilled chickens and 349,594 pork
sausages.
   Since its inception, the annual event has only been canceled 24
times, in 1854 and 1873 because of cholera epidemics, and during
and after World War I and World War II.

   ``He was so ugly he had to sneak up on
breakfast,'' one tale-spinner said, as ``Once upon a time ...''
took on a down-home flavor out at the eighth annual Northern
Appalachian Storytelling Festival.
   Storytelling often has been relegated to the children's hour at
libraries, storytellers said at the weekend event at Mansfield
University in north-central Pennsylvania.
   But now they said they are in demand for everything from therapy
for emotionally disturbed children to corporate picnics.
   ``Folk arts never die out. It's like a river that flows
underground,'' said Gamble Rogers, 51, of St. Augustine, Fla.
``Then it breaks back into the sunlight.''
   ``Just tell what happened and it's history,'' said Rogers, one
of four storytellers at the two-day festival. ``Storytelling is
just like history gussied up a little bit.''
   Jimmy Neil Smith, director of the National Association for the
Preservation and Perpetuation of Storytelling in Jonesborough,
Tenn., said the number of full-time professional storytellers has
increased from about a dozen in 1973 to 200 or more.
   Attendance at the National Storytelling Festival, held each
October since 1973 in Jonesborough, has grown from 60 to more than
5,000, Smith said. Mansfield's festival was expected to draw 500
people this weekend, up from 50 when it started.
   Storytelling lagged with the coming of radio and television but
has reemerged as people have turned back to basics, Smith said.
   ``There's something very special and very important and very
powerful about a told story. ... It's a co-creational process. With
television, everything we have is created for us. We literally see
the smoking gun,'' said Smith, 41, a former high school English and
journalism teacher.
   Rogers began his career in the 1960s performing as a back-up
guitarist and later toured as a folk singer. ``Through the early
and mid '70s, I kept expanding the introductions to my songs,'' he
said.
   Now, his guitar playing provides interludes for colorful tales
sprinkled with down-home wisdom.
   He told of massive high school teacher Eulalah Singleterry,
``who loomed above us like a myopic praying mantis,'' and a pit
bull charging him that resembled ``a blimp swallowed in a mammoth
raccoon coat.''
   And he told of the movie projectionist ``so ugly he had to sneak
up on breakfast.''
   Jim May gave up teaching elementary school to tell stories full
time in 1985. He strung together humorous anecdotes from his
childhood in rural McHenry County, Illinois, where he grew up
listening to stories from his father, a horse-trader, his
grandfather, who ran the general store, and other family members.
   ``If you want to learn the family stories, you have to go to all
the funerals,'' May said.
   Bobby Norfolk, 37, was a park ranger in St. Louis who had
dabbled in stand-up comedy and acting before becoming a full-time
storyteller two years ago. He told a folk tale from Ghana about a
pot that produced food on command until the man who found it got
greedy and ruined its magical powers.
   Maggie Peirce, 57, a native of Belfast, Northern Ireland, began
as a folk singer and has been storytelling since 1972.
   She told an Irish folk tale about a young man who apprentices as
a thief, beginning her story with: ``Once upon a time when the
birds ate lime and the monkeys chewed tobacco up a tree ...''
   ``That's how my father started every story,'' she said.

   Dominador Kayser Bazan, a former Panamanian

Saturday.
   Rey Bazan said men in civilian clothes went to his brother's

   Noriega, as the commander of Panama's 15,000 member Defense

   Dominador Bazan, an associate of President Eric Delvalle who was
deposed by Noriega last Februay, had resigned as ambassador to
Washington in late 1987.
   Delvalle was ousted after he tried to fire Noriega as the
military commander. Noriega had been indicted in February by two
federal grand juries in Florida that accused him of drug
trafficking.
   Dominador Bazan had been named foreign minister only a few hours
before Delvalle was removed, and he also left the government.
   He was a director of a television station owned by Delvalle that
was shut down by the government earlier this year.
   The United States still recognizes Delvalle as Panama's
president and has imposed economic sanctions against Panama.
Noriega has defied U.S. pressure to resign and leave the country.

   The government said Saturday
that U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar will visit
South Africa soon to discuss a regional peace initiative.
   Roland Darroll, a spokesman for the Department of Foreign
Affairs, said he did not know the exact date of Perez de Cuellar's
planned visit and additional details would be released Monday.
   A U.N. spokeswoman in New York said Tuesday that Perez de
Cuellar had accepted an invitation from President P.W. Botha to
visit South Africa.
   Spokeswoman Nadia Younes said, ``A mutually convenient time for
the visit is being discussed. When the visit materializes, the
secretary-general will use the opportunity to visit certain other
countries in the region.''
   The U.N. General Assembly will formally open its 43d annual
session on Tuesday. The guerrilla wars in Angola and South-West
Africa, also known as Namibia, are on the agenda in coming weeks.
   South Africa has administered Namibia under a mandate issued by
the League of Nations after World War I and has rejected U.N.
resolutions repudiating that mandate and calling for independence
for the territory.
   South Africa has said it is willing to grant independence to the
territory next June 1 if the estimated 50,000 Cuban military
personnel supporting the Marxist government in neighboring Angola
have been withdrawn by that date.
   Angolan, Cuban and South African troops have been observing a
cease-fire since Aug. 8 in the 13-year-old war in Angola. South
Africa and the United States back the rebels of the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola.
   In Namibia, guerrillas of the South-West Africa People's
Organization have been fighting for independence from
white-controlled South Africa since 1966.
   Angolan, Cuban and South African representatives and U.S.
mediators have held several rounds of talks in recent months and
another set of negotiations may be held this week in Brazzaville,
Congo.
   They have not been able to agree on a date for Namibian
independence and the removal of the Cubans from Angola.
   Perez de Cuellar has frequently criticized South Africa's system
of apartheid, under which the 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs and the 5 million whites control the country.

   Taking a break from the headaches of the
Palestinian uprising and Israel's election campaign, thousands of
Israelis turned out Saturday for a canine beauty pageant.
   Marco, a feisty boxer owned by Dov Amir, padded off with the
champion's trophy after beating out 800 other pretty pooches in
Israel's dog-of-the-year contest held in Tel Aviv's Exhibition
Center.
   ``We can find time for other things besides the intefadeh,''
said organizer Avi Marshak, using the Arabic word for uprising to
describe the 9-month-old wave of Palestinian violence aimed at
ending Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   About 20,000 people attended the two-day show, organizers said.
   Israeli couples in cutoff jeans and short-sleeved shirts pushed
baby strollers from ring to ring to view the more than 50 different
breeds ranging from tiny lap dogs like the Yorkshire terriers to
Great Danes and St. Bernards.
   Marshak said the contest was sanctioned by the World Kennel Club
based in Brussels, Belgium, and had judges from the Netherlands,
South Africa, Italy and Britain.
   But although the competition was billed as an international
event, organizers conceded there were few if any contestants from
abroad. This was in contrast to 1987, before the uprising began,
when a World Dog Show competition attracted scores of foreign
competitors to Israel.
   ``Even so, we don't feel the intefadeh here,'' said Rafi Shahaf,
a veterinarian, who was interviewed in the show ring where Conan,
his steel gray Mastino Napoletano, had just taken a blue ribbon.
   The show briefly pushed the Nov. 1 general elections out of the
limelight for the doglovers. Experts say the razor-tight race
between the right-wing Likud Party and the left-leaning Labor Party
could determine the future of the Israeli-occupied Palestinian
lands.

   A police officer was reassigned after
videotapes showed him thrusting his baton into a crowd
demonstrating outside a hotel where Vice President George Bush was
holding a fund-raiser, the mayor said Saturday.
   United Farm Worker leader Dolores Huerta, who was distributing
information about a table grape boycott, was injured during the
demonstration Wednesday.
   Mayor Art Agnos said Huerta was cleary visible in the group seen
on the videotape. Huerta suffered two broken ribs and a ruptured
spleen.
   Police said there were about 100 officers and 850 protesters at
the demonstration outside the hotel where Bush was holding a
$1,000-a-plate fund-raiser. Earlier that day, Bush had announced
his opposition to the union's table grape boycott.
   Huerta, 58, a union vice president, co-founded the union in 1964
with her brother-in-law Cesar Chavez.
   Agnos said he, Police Chief Frank Jordan and other top police
officials reviewed videotapes of the protest provided by television
station KRON before deciding to reassign officer Francis Achim to
administrative duty, pending the outcome of several investigations
into the incident.
   The mayor said that he has asked the police department to review
its policies for use of batons in crowd-control situations.
   ``Police face a difficult task when outnumbered by large numbers
of demonstrators and I want to be sure they use the most prudent
methods _ methods that minimize the risk of injury to themselves or
anyone else,'' Agnos said.
   Agnos, a UFW supporter for 20 years, has visited Huerta at the
hospital at least twice. He said she has not been interviewed about
the incident yet, on the request of her doctor.
   According to Huerta's son, Emilio, an officer took a UFW flag
she was carrying, threw it to ground and stomped on it. He also
said the same officer poked her several times above her left hip.
   In Southern California on Saturday, actor Martin Sheen led 350
supporters of the union's ``Boycott Grapes'' campaign on a
traffic-stopping march down Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu. The
march was dedicated to Huerta.
   Chavez staged a 36-day fast that ended Aug. 21 to protest
pesticide use on grapes. Union officials charge that excess use of
the chemicals has caused cancer in farm worker families, a charge
that government and industry officials strongly deny.

   Palestinian and Jordanian officials met
Saturday to discuss aid from Arab countries to help Palestinians in
the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, Jordan's news media
reported.
   The joint Jordanian-Palestinian Committee on the Steadfastness
of Palestinians Living in Israeli-Occupied Territories ``reviewed
its financial situation and ways of contacting some Arab countries
for funds needed so that the committee can continue its
activities,'' the official news agency said.
   A Foreign Ministry official said the committee wants to raise
$450 million to finance economic and social projects in the
territories.
   The official, speaking with the condition he not be identified,
said the committee would contact Arab countries that have not paid
promised commitments to the fund.
   Mahmoud Abbas, member of the executive committee of the
Palestine Liberation organization, headed the Palestinian side at
the meeting and Foreign Minister Taher Masri led the Jordanian side.
   King Hussein and PLO leader Yasser Arafat formed the joint
committee in 1980 to channel economic and other aid to 1.5
Palestinians living under Israeli occupation. It became the only
formal link between Jordan and the PLO after Hussein's decision in
July to his government from Palestinian affairs in the occupied
territories.
   A 9-month-old uprising against Israeli occupation in the
territories has left 268 Palestinians and six Israelis dead.
   According to resolutions of the Arab League's Baghdad summit in
1980, oil-rich Arab countries agreed to contribute $100 million to
help finance development projects in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
captured by Israel from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East
War.
   Among those countries _ Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and
Saudi Arabia _ only the Saudi government kept its promise and paid
its $30 million share, the official said.
   Palestinian and Jordanian officials were not available for
comment.

   Police retrieved the remains of two
American servicemen from an icy glacier where their plane crashed
shortly after the end of World War II, the Italian news agency ANSA
reported Saturday.
   The two men, a colonel and a corporal, were killed in 1946 when
their Boeing B-17 crashed at an altitude of 10,000 feet on a snowy
Alpine mountain.
   The wreckage was discovered several years ago embedded in the
ice, but there had been no sign of remains or of documents to
identify the victims, ANSA said.
   Police confirmed the discovery but they refused to release the
identities of the servicemen or say how the remains were found on
Friday.
   Search crews were looking for remains of other victims of the
crash.

   Republican George Bush was picked to win the
presidency by voters who were asked to set aside their political
preferences and predict the Election Day victor, according to a
poll released Saturday by U.S. News & World Report.
   Fifty-three percent of the 669 respondents to the telephone poll
said they expected Bush to win this fall, while 26 percent picked
Democrat Michael Dukakis to be the victor. Twenty-two percent said
they didn't know.
   The poll, conducted Wednesday and Thursday, had a 3.8 percentage
point margin of error. It was conducted for U.S. News by KRC
Research@Hotline with Everett Ladd of the Roper Center for Public
Opinion Research.
   While voters picked Bush to win in November, by a slight margin
they thought Dukakis would fare best when the two candidates square
off in a debate on Sept. 25.
   Thirty-one percent said they thought Dukakis would win over the
most people to his side on the basis of his debate performance,
while 26 percent thought Bush would win outperform Dukakis. Fifteen
percent thought the two would tie, and 28 percent didn't know or
had no opinion.
   A full 50 percent of the survey's respondents, when asked to
summarize the campaign to date, said the candidates' positions
haven't been spelled out. Nineteen percent said the campaign has
been too negative, 14 percent said it has been informative and 8
percent said they had not paid much attention.
   Asked their opinion of Bush, 56 percent said their impression
was favorable and 28 percent said it was unfavorable. On Dukakis,
42 percent had a favorable opinion and 37 percent said unfavorable.

   A U.N. human rights delegation met Saturday
in Havana with Cuban activists, religious groups and legislative
leaders, the official Cuban news agency Prensa Latina said.
   Cuban President Fidel Castro invited the Geneva-based U.N. Human
Rights Commission to Havana to investigate U.S. allegations that
his government is guilty of serious human rights violations.
   The delegation, which arrived in the Cuban capital Friday for a
nine-day visit, met at the Hotel Commodore with six members of the
Pro-Human Rights Committee of Cuba and with four members of the
executive committee of the Ecumenical Council of Cuba, Prensa
Latina said in a dispatch monitored in Mexico City.
   It reported the president of the ecumenical council, Raul
Suarez, said his delegation ``didn't denounce anyone. We just
represented the 18 churches and seven ecumenical movements that are
part of the council.''
   Prensa Latina said the hotel lobby was packed with reporters,
onlookers and several people who described themselves as formerly
imprisoned ``counterrevolutionaries'' who want to leave Cuba.
   The agency's report said that later the U.N. delegation had a
two-hour meeting with legislative leaders. It quoted the head of
the National Assembly as saying he and other lawmakers described
Cuba's legislative system and ``responded to a number of
questions.''
   Cuban officials have said the U.N. delegation members can talk
to whomever they like.
   The delegation's spokesman, Roger Han-Moevi of Benin, said the
panel planned to interview private citizens, government officials
and representatives of non-governmental organizations during the
visit, the news agency reported.
   On Sunday, the U.N. delegation planned to visit the Island of
Youth, where 20,000 people from all over the Third World work and
study, Prensa Latina said.

   The Boston schools superintendent said he enrolled
his daughter in a public school outside the city to protect her
from possible gang violence.
   Laval S. Wilson said his 16-year-old daughter, Nicole, witnessed
seven youths putting a homemade bomb in a locker at her school last
April.
   Although there had been no threats to his daughter, Wilson said
he and his wife are concerned about possible retaliation because
she had helped law enforcement officials investigate the incident
at the Boston Technical High School in the city's impoverished and
drug-ridden Roxbury section.
   Some of the youths were identified as members of a gang, Wilson
said. He said he supported his daughter's intention to testify and
said she should not be penalized for it.
   Wilson declined to identify the community or the school where
Nicole is studying. He said he and his wife decided on the change
after studying the case during the summer.
   Some parent activists in Boston public schools said they
sympathize with Wilson's concerns, but questioned why he did not
transfer his daughter to another high school within Boston.
   ``You question his own confidence in the Boston public
schools,'' said Paula Georges, executive director of the Citywide
Educational Coalition. ``Is there no other high school in the
system that is good enough?''
   Wilson said he and his wife decided transferring within the
system would not solve their daughter's problem. He said the youths
involved may have friends in other high schools in the city.
   Wilson said the seven youths who admitted their part in the
April 15 blast, which caused no injuries, were expelled or
transferred to other schools.

   About 200 people were feared drowned
Saturday after a river swollen by Hurricane Gilbert's heavy rains
surged over its banks, sweeping away four buses and flooding scores
of homes, authorities said.
   The raging Santa Catarina River engulfed cars, crushed houses
and flooded large areas of this industrial city of 3 million about
110 miles from the Texas border. Much of Monterrey was without
power and drinking water and the airport was closed.
   Gov. Jorge Trevino Martinez declared the state of Nuevo Leon a
disaster area.
   ``It was a terrible thing, the worst thing that could have
happened here,'' said his spokesman, Geraldo Castro. ``This
disaster is unprecedented in the state.''
   The hurricane, the strongest on record, was downgraded to a
tropical depression Saturday after leaving at least 100 other
people dead across the Caribbean, Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula and
Texas.
   Castro said there were at least 200 people aboard the four
buses. ``I don't think many of them could have escaped,'' he said.
Red Cross spokesman Adelberto Salas said only 13 people aboard the
buses were saved.
   Castro said some 20,000 people in the state were homeless,
12,000 of them in Monterrey.
   ``We all left with only the clothes on our backs,'' Victorio
Cruz said as he picked through mud, gravel and the cement blocks
where his two-room house had stood.
   Flood waters began to recede late Saturday but the current in
the Santa Catarina was too strong for a search for bodies.
   Trevino told a news conference the bodies ``are buried in mud.
If there are people inside (the buses), they are dead.''
   He said a total of 60 bodies had been recovered in Monterrey and
downstream Saturday but a ``considerable number'' of people were
still missing.
   ``The current carried more bodies but we don't how many there
are,'' said Coroner Juventio Guerrero in the suburban township of
Guadalupe.
   Four policemen were swept to their deaths trying to rescue the
bus passengers, said Comandante Antulio Alejo, commander of the
Cobra police unit. The National Civil Defense System in Mexico City
said two volunteers helping the police officers were missing.
   Alejo also said that at the same spot ``There are several cars
buried there also and we understand that some bodies are still in
some of the cars.''
   Weather stations reported that Hurricane Gilbert, during a
28-hour period beginning Friday and ending Saturday morning, poured
12 inches of rain on Monterrey.
   As the water began to subside Saturday afternoon the wheels and
chassis of one overturned bus could be seen. The vehicle was buried
up to the wheels by mud and rocks.
   Nearby and partially buried were construction machines and other
vehicles that had been carried by the raging waters into the river.
   Eduardo Pichardo, an employee of Transportes Frontera in
Monterrey, said about 64 people were aboard the two buses from his
company. He said one bus was en route to Monterrey from the border
city of Nuevo Laredo and the other was on a run from Monterrey to
Mexico City.
   Police said the buses were coming from the direction of
Saltillo, about 55 miles west of Monterrey. Saltillo, a city of
about 450,000, is the capital of neighboring Coahuila state. Police
said the buses probably had been diverted from their original
routes because of flooded roads.
   They said rising water stranded the buses on a low-lying stretch
of road parallel to the river. As a special police unit, the
Cobras, tried to rescue the passengers, the current increased, the
water rose and the buses overturned.
   Downstream from Monterrey, bodies were being recovered from the
river, police said.
   The bodies of an elderly woman, a small boy and two men, all
unidentified, were found in the town of Juarez 14 miles east of
Monterrey, said federal police spokesman Felipe de Jesus Banda
Martinez.
   In Cadereyta, 20 miles east of Monterrey, a police spokesman
said another ``eight or ten bodies have been pulled out of the
river.''
   At noon EDT Saturday, the National Hurricane Center in Coral
Gables, Fla. issued its final advisory on Gilbert.
   It said the center of the storm was near latitude 25.5 north and
longitude 101.0 west or about 220 miles west southwest of
Brownsville, Texas, and 45 miles southwest of Monterrey.
   Maximum sustained winds were estimated to be near 35 mph and the
storm was expected to weaken further. But rainfall of 10 to 15
inches was forecast, with up to 20 inches in some areas.
   It was the second time in three days that Gilbert slammed into
Mexico.
   The storm hit the Yucatan Peninsula on Wednesday and killed at
least 29 people after leaving 69 people dead in the Caribbean.
   Gilbert, which turned into a hurricane Sept. 10, killed 26 in
Jamaica, 30 in Haiti, five in the Dominican Republic and eight in
Honduras.
   The storm at one point packed sustained winds of 175 mph and had
gusts of more than 200 mph. It was the most intense storm on record
in terms of barometric pressure, which was measured at 26.13,
breaking the 26.35 inches recorded for the 1935 hurricane that
devastated the Florida Keys.
   The storm left 500,000 homeless and caused $8 billion in damage
in Jamaica. In Haiti, the military government declared a state of
emergency in three southern regions, where 50 to 60 percent of the
agricultural production was destroyed.
   The storm left the eastern Yucatan resort of Cancun in shambles.
About 300,000 people were homeless in Yucatan state and 10,000 more
homeless in Campeche, on the west coast of the peninsula, said
Notimex, the Mexican news agency.
   Gilbert stranded 8,000 tourists in Cancun and Cozumel, left much
of the peninsula without power or communications and caused
hundreds of millions of dollars in damage.
   The storm came ashore again Friday afternoon along a sparsely
populated stretch of the Gulf of Mexico coast south of Matamoros.
   It quickly began to dissipate into torrential rains and high
winds that drenched the northeastern states of Tamaulipas, Nuevo
Leon and Coahuila.
   In Texas, heavy rains fell on Brownsville, with gusts up to 82
mph recorded at nearby Padre Island, but the vulnerable coastal
area escaped the worst of the storm.
   A woman was killed Saturday morning when a tornado hit her
mobile home in Bexar County, Texas. A second person died in San
Antonio when a utility pole crashed into a house.

   President Corazon Aquino said Friday
she hoped the Philippines and the United States could resolve their
differences and end a deadlock over compensation and other issues
in negotiations over U.S. bases.
   ``Well, they have their position, and we have ours,'' she said
of the disagreement.
   Mrs. Aquino made her remarks before Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev offered to give up the Soviet base at Cam Ranh Bay,
Vietnam, if the United States closes its six installations in the
Philippines.
   She told reporters Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus was trying
to narrow differences in his talks with Secretary of State George
P. Shultz in the United States, ``so I'm hoping they will.''
   The Filipino-U.S. talks are to set compensation and other terms
for the final two years of the bases agreement, which expires in
1991. Mrs. Aquino refuses to say if she will support extending the
agreement.
   On Thursday, Shultz said in Washington that the United States
wants to keep the giant Clark Air Base, Subic Navy Base and other
installations but Filipino money demands were too high.
   U.S. officials say Washington is considering moving the bases to
Guam or other sites.
   The United States now pays about $180 million a year to use the
bases. Congressional sources have said Washington offered to
increase the compensation to nearly $500 million, including
doubling direct bases-related aid to $360 million.
   Manila newspapers say the Philippines has demanded up to $1.2
billion a year, although Manglapus refuses to confirm that figure.
   Many Filipinos see the bases as an odious vestige of American
rule here, which ended with Philippine independence in 1946.
   In addition, Manglapus and other officials maintain the bases do
not serve Philippine interests because the country does not
perceive an external threat.
   Last week, Deputy Foreign Secretary Jose Ingles told a meeting
of non-aligned nations in Nicosia, Cyprus, that the bases may
threaten national security by making the Philippines a target in a
future superpower confrontation.

   A report on a June train crash that killed 57
people said a radio alert from the train hurtling out of control 90
seconds before impact was not relayed over loudspeakers at the
station until 30 seconds before it hit.
   An investigating commission's findings, made public Friday, said
the accident at the Gare de Lyon station was due to a ``chain of
circumstances'' implicating both personnel and the complex rules of
the state-run train authority.
   The 36-page report recommended better training for personnel,
modification of some equipment and an improved radio network.
   It stressed the ``unfavorable circumstances'' caused by a
passenger who pulled an alarm to automatically stop the suburban
train shortly before it was to enter Paris at rush hour June 27.
   The train restarted, then hurled without breaks into the
station, crashing into a standing train about to depart.
   The report said that from the moment the conductor tried
rearming the breaks after the unscheduled stop, a series of
technical and human errors took place.
   The report noted that a radio alert was given just 1{ minutes
before the accident while loudspeakers warned of the impending
crash just 30 seconds in advance, leaving passengers on the
standing train little time to evacuate. Most of the dead were in
the standing train.
   Transport Minister Michel Delebarre said the report had been
handed over to the head of the train authority, Jacques Fournier,
for study before a board meeting scheduled for Oct. 26.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department has advised the
Canadian and Illinois-based makers of railroad maintenance
equipment that it will file a lawsuit to block their proposed joint
manufacturing venture, a department official said Friday.
   The $30 million project proposed by Ivaco Inc. of Montreal and
Jackson Jordan Inc. of Schaumburg, Ill., would violate federal
antitrust laws, said Charles F. Rule, the assistant attorney
general in charge of the department's antitrust division.
   In a statement issued late Friday, Rule said the venture might
lessen competition in the production and sale of automatic tampers,
large pieces of equipment used to level and allign railroad tracks.
   ``The proposed joint venture would control over 70 percent of
the automatic tampers sold in the United States,'' he said. ``We
are particularly concerned ... because it would reduce to only two
the number of United States sellers of automatic tampers. As a
result, railroad companies would face higher prices.''
   Sales of the tampers totalled about $15 million last year, the
Justice Department said.
   Ivaco is the largest domestic producer of the equipment, made by
its Canron Inc. subsidiary at plants in Columbia, S.C., Toronto,
and Queensland, Australia, the department said.
   It said Jackson Jordan, which produces tampers at a plant in
Ludington, Mich., ranks third in U.S. production behind Plasser &
Theurer of Austria, which operates a plant in Chesapeake, Va.
   A receptionists answering the telephone at Jackson Jordan
headquarters said the company's offices were closed for the weekend
and that officials could not be reached for comment. Calls to Ivaco
in Montreal were unanswered.

<HEAD>EPA Must Decide If It Will Regulate All Benzene Emissions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency must
decide by March 13 whether to regulate benzene emissions from at
least nine additional sources, according to a federal judge's
ruling.
   The ruling by U.S. District Judge June L. Green declined,
however, to impose a deadline sought by an environmental group for
tightening controls on evaporation of gasoline, one source of
benzene, from cars.
   Benzene is a major chemical building block for producing other
chemicals. Breathing benzene causes leukemia, according to studies
of industrial workers.
   Though EPA has made decisions about several sources of benzene,
and is considering major regulations for some of them, the judge
said the Clean Air Act requires the agency to make explicit
decisions on benzene emissions from other sources the agency has
identified _ plants making ethylene, chlorobenzene, nitrobenzene,
linear alkyl benzene and cyclohexane; chemical and refinery waste
disposal; industrial solvent usage and the bulk handling and
transportation of gasoline.
   If the agency decides these sources deserve regulation, it must
adopt regulations within six months, the judge said in the ruling
issued Thursday.
   EPA expects to adopt a tightening of auto gasoline evaporation
regulations by the end of the year.
   David Doniger, attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, the plaintiff in the case, said Friday the ruling applied
to all hazardous air pollutants over which EPA has jurisdiction.
``EPA can't just pick one source, regulate it and say, `That's
it,''' Doniger said.
   The sources in question were identified in the 1970s ``but just
dropped off the agency's scopes,'' he said.
   Alan Eckart, associate general counsel of EPA, said: ``We have a
lot of doubt whether she had jurisdiction to issue the order,'' and
for the plaintiff, ``the proper way would have been a petition to
use to regulate those sources.'' However, he said EPA has not
decided whether to appeal.

   The Justice Department is reviewing 40
break-ins at offices and residences of political opponents of the
Reagan administration's Central America policies, FBI Director
William Sessions told Congress on Friday.
   The department, Sessions told a House subcommittee, is trying to
determine whether there were violations of civil rights in the
break-ins, which in most cases are unsolved.
   Government lawyers are reviewing the incidents on the basis that
the unidentified people committing the crimes may have conspired to
inhibit the victims from carrying out their constitutional rights
to petition Congress.
   The FBI already has said it has found nothing to suggest the
burglaries are connected to each other and has ascertained no
pattern to them.
   A member of the House subcommittee on civil and constitutional
rights, Rep. Robert Kastenmeier, D-Wis., theorized that the
break-ins possibly could be politically motivated and are being
carried out by Salvadorans in this country or by intelligence
assets of the FBI.
   Subcommittee chairman Don Edwards, D-Calif., suggested the
Salvadoran National Guard, which critics of the Salvadoran
government say is linked to right-wing death squads in that
country, also might be in contact with those conducting the
break-ins.
   Sessions told the panel that Kastenmeier's and Edwards' theories
may be correct, but that the bureau has nothing to substantiate
them.
   Reagan administration critics have suggested the FBI might be
involved in the break-ins, but bureau officials have said they have
found no evidence of that.
   Sessions said it is ``important for the American public to know
that it is not the bureau'' involved in the burglaries and he said
he looks forward to ``being able to respond'' to inquiries by
Edwards that the bureau had nothing to do with them ``and I hope
that it is always that way.''
   At one of the locations under review in the Justice Department
examination, the Old Cambridge Baptist Church in Cambridge, Mass.,
has been burglarized 10 times since 1984.
   The church houses the New England Central American Network, a
coalition of 150 organizations opposing U.S. military intervention
in Central America and organizing food shipments to Nicaragua.
   Edwards last May sent Sessions a list of break-ins at the homes,
churches and offices of people opposed to U.S. policy in Central
America.
   He wants the Justice Department to conduct more widely focused
probes of the burglaries, on the basis that they interfere with
First Amendment rights, not just on the narrow question of whether
the groups lobby Congress.
   Edwards' list of break-ins in a May 4 letter totaled more than
70. Edwards says there now are some 100 break-ins that appear to
fit the pattern of being targeted at Central American policy
opponents.

<TEXT>
   Despite some criticism that his call for
an evacuation of the island was unnecessary, City Manager Doug
Matthews said Friday he made the decision because his primary
interest was in saving lives.
   By Friday morning, about 65 percent of the 65,000 Galveston
residents were off the island with 40 percent of them leaving
before the evacuation recommendation was given, Matthews said.
   Matthews said his decision to call for evacuation was based in
part on a report by the Texas Department of Public Safety that the
hurricane could hit near Freeport if it turned northward overnight.
   The report said if that happened, Friday morning would be too
late to evacuate the entire island, which takes 17 hours.
   About 90 percent of the businesses were closed on the island
Friday. Many homes and businesses were boarded up. ``It's like a
ghost town around here,'' Matthews said.
   As Gilbert's center moved onto the northern Mexican shore Friday
afternoon, however, forecasters lifted a hurricane watch for the
upper Texas coast at 2 p.m. and Galveston officials rescinded their
evacuation recommendation.
   DPS officials in Austin said the data may have been
misinterpreted by Galveston officials and that evacuation may have
been premature.
   But Matthews said Friday he did not misinterpret the data and
that it was just one piece of information used to decide whether to
evacuate.
   Even if the hurricane misses the Galveston area, the economic
impact caused by lost tourist dollars and closed businesses could
top $70 million, city manager Doug Matthews said Friday.
   At least 30 area school districts were closed Friday and
athletic and cultural events were postponed because of the
hurricane's threat. NASA's Johnson Space Center sent all but a few
employees home Thursday and closed the center to tourists.
   In Houston, traffic was lighter than usual Friday morning as
area schools, colleges and some businesses decided not to open. But
many other businesses decided against closing as the threat of
Gilbert waned.
   Tenneco Inc., which employs nearly 4,000 people in the area,
remained open Friday as did Shell Oil Co. with its 13,000 Houston
workers.
   Suzanne Thomas, a Tenneco spokeswoman, said ``it was business as
usual'' Friday despite the threat earlier this week the storm might
hit the area. She said the company had no problems conducting
business.
   ``We stayed open. Most of the downtown businesses did,'' Ms.
Thomas said.
   The Bankers Association said Houston banks also were open Friday.
   In hindsight, Matthews said he would have made the same decision
because he was more concerned about saving lives than anything
else. In Texas, officials may recommend an evacuation but they
cannot order people from their homes.
   Although the storm has forced many businesses to close and send
employees home, it has meant big sales to some other companies.
   Panic-buying this week cleared the shelves of many grocery
stores in the area and sales also were booming at lumber and
hardware stores. But sales could slow later as people use up their
hurricane provisions.
   And although oil prices increased earlier this week partly
because of the storm, the decreasing chance that Gilbert would
seriously disrupt energy production in the Gulf helped curb the
recent rally.
   Oil and gas companies operating in the Gulf evacuated many of
their personnel from refineries and oil platforms, but observers
said the prospect of major disruption in oil supplies had waned.

   When the syndicated television show
``Entertainment Tonight'' planned a show on media hoaxers, they
contacted veteran hoaxer Joey Skaggs _ who quickly hoaxed them by
sending a friend to do the interview.
   ``How could I resist?'' Skaggs asked after the program aired
Friday night. ``I mean, who did they think they were dealing with?''
   Skaggs, speaking by telephone from his Manhattan apartment, was
ecstatic after viewing the opening segment on the show, which
featured co-host Mary Hart delivering this caveat:
   ``The hoaxers are honest enough to admit they enjoy the
attention. But their bottom line is this: Let the talk show
bookers, the newspaper assignment editors and the viewers beware.''
   Laughed Skaggs: ``The only problem is they didn't take their own
advice.''
   ``Joey pulled a fast one on us,'' said ET producer Kevin
Narblock from Los Angeles, adding he suspected Skaggs might have
been up to something when a picture of the hoaxer in Penthouse
magazine didn't match the fellow on the film.
   Hart introduced the phony Skaggs, played by writer-teacher
Norman Savage, by detailing a hoax perpetrated on ``Good Morning
America'' where Skaggs offered a cure for the common cold: the
common cockroach.
   Savage, wearing a pair of dark sunglasses, then says, ``What I
hope to achieve is that the public becomes more skeptical. And if
they're more skeptical, maybe they're more discerning, more
demanding. And so the media, then, has to police themselves a
little better.''
   Skaggs said he was doubly tickled because he had appeared
previously on ``Entertainment Tonight,'' so the program should have
footage of what he really looks like.

   A Continental Express commuter plane from North
Platte, Neb., belly-landed at Stapleton International Airport
Friday night after the pilot reported landing gear problems, but
there were no reports of injuries.
   Flight 2063, a Beechcraft 1900 propjet scheduled to arrive at
Denver at 5:25 p.m., made the emergency landing at 6:30 p.m.,
Stapleton officials said.
   Stapleton spokesman Richard Boulware said none of the seven
passengers or two crew members appeared to have been injured, and
there was little damage to the plane.
   He said the pilot notified Stapleton officials that he was
having problems lowering the plane's landing gear. Authorities
cleared the runway and posted emergency personnel as the plane went
into its landing pattern.
   The landing itself, telecast by Denver television stations,
appeared smooth, with the plane sliding to a halt without flames or
smoke evident, even though the runway had not been prepared for the
landing with foam.
   Boulware said the propeller was stopped when the plane descended
to 5 feet above the ground. The craft skidded a half-mile down the
runway before coming to a stop, he said.

Cinemas</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Major American motion picture exporters asked
anew Friday for U.S. government intervention to enable them to
operate film distribution offices in South Korea.
   The Motion Picture Export Association of America, in a formal
unfair trade complaint to the U.S. Trade Representative, accused
South Korea of violating a 1985 agreement permitting independent
U.S. distribution of major Hollywood productions, of discrimination
and of failure to crack down on pirating of video cassettes.
   Announcing the action, MPEAA Chairman Jack Valenti told
reporters the South Korean film importing and distributing industry
has launched a ``very aggressive attack to make sure that Americans
never get to open their own offices'' as promised in 1985.
   Seoul cinema houses bypassing local distributors to deal
directly with the American exporters have been threatened with
having ``live snakes let loose in their theaters'' to frighten away
audiences, Valenti said, quoting Korean press reports.
   Two Seoul cinemas that made direct bookings with the U.S.
exporters to show ``Fatal Attraction'' and ``Batteries Not
Included,'' pictures that were hits elsewhere in Asia, were
expelled from their industry association and may be forced to
cancel the openings later this month, Valenti said.
   It is a coincidence that the trade complaint is being filed at
the start of the Seoul Olympic Games, when Korea is at the center
of international attention, Valenti said. MPEAA has been warning
for weeks it would take action unless Korean authorities agreed to
negotiate the issues and a recent meeting with the South Korean
ambassador produced no results, he said.
   The South Korean Embassy did not respond immediately to requests
for comment on the MPEAA complaints.
   The 1985 accord allowed MPEAA companies to import and distribute
their motion pictures in Korea, he said. That accord prompted MPEAA
to withdraw an earlier formal complaint it had filed with the U.S.
trade representative charging unfair trade.
   But three years later, the country's domestic film distribution
industry, ``literally defying their government,'' has made it
economically impossible for U.S. exporters to operate distribution
offices, Valenti said.
   Valenti said South Korea is the only country outside the Soviet
bloc where the U.S. film industry cannot freely operate its own
distribution system and split profits directly with cinemas. South
Korea's 673 cinemas showed 11 MPEAA pictures in 1984, 18 in 1985,
28 in 1986, 30 in 1987 and nine the first half of this year, he
said.
   But independent U.S. film-makers not belonging to MPEAA operate
in South Korea by selling films outright and 75 percent of the
movie houses show American pictures, Valenti acknowledged.

   Nancy Clark rode her sailboard over
the northern edge of Hurricane Gilbert on Friday to the cheers of a
surfside crowd that gathered after word their city would be spared
the brunt of the hurricane.
   Much of Corpus Christi seemed abandoned Friday, but Ocean Drive
was jammed with traffic as residents and tourists flocked to the
city's seawall with the news that Gilbert would hit farther south
than expected.
   The eye of the hurricane came ashore Friday afternoon about 120
miles south of Brownsville, or about 280 miles from Corpus Christi.
   Scores of cars cruised up and down the windy beachfront road in
Corpus Christi, as bicyclists, joggers and windsurfers were joined
by crowds of residents complaining of cabin fever in their
boarded-up homes.
   ``This is definitely the advanced class,'' said Ms. Clark, a
legal investigator who took her sailboard into 35-mph winds after
fleeing Port Isabel near Brownsville.
   ``This definitely rates a `10'. But it's also a good day for
conservative, positive sailing,'' said Corpus Christi architect
Robert Jones, one of about a half-dozen surfers who rode high tides
at 4 feet above normal levels.
   ``I was sitting in the house with the windows boarded up,
getting kind of bored,'' said Jones. ``I decided I'd just get out
here and see what the winds were like.''
   Many of the residents and tourists who decided to stay in Corpus
Christi had heard repeated warnings that Gilbert would likely turn
toward the north, striking land near Brownsville and bashing Corpus
Christi with heavy wind and rain.
   But when the hurricane stayed on its course toward Mexico, the
seawall swelled with confident crowds.
   ``Most people probably wouldn't expect to see this many people
down here in a hurricane, but once you've lived in Corpus Christi
for a while, you come to expect the unusual out of the residents,''
said Russ Roland, who was enjoying his daily bicycle ride along the
seawall.
   Families gathered along the seawall as the waves lapped at the
concrete steps, and children danced along the edge of the churning
water, mugging for cameras.
   Many, including Doug Reiter, said they just grew tired of
sitting inside a house darkened by plywood-covered windows.
   ``I think everybody is just bored, and this is kind of a release
from being cooped up,'' he said. ``You can only take that sort of
thing so long before you start getting stir crazy.''

<TEXT>
   Quality Inns International Inc. must stop using
the name ``McSleep Inns'' for its economy hotels because the public
would believe the hotels are owned by the fast-food giant
McDonald's Corp., a judge ruled Friday.
   U.S. District Judge Paul Niemeyer said the use of the prefix
``Mc'' is a ``deliberate attempt to benefit by the good will and
reputation of McDonald's.''
   He granted McDonald's a permanent injuction and gave Quality
Inns 30 days to comply with the injunction.
   The company immediately responded to the injunction by changing
the name of their new hotel chain to ``Sleep Inns,'' which will
offer a night's lodging for $20 to $29. The first two ``Sleep
Inns'' will break ground next week in Nova Scotia, Canada, and
Salisbury, N.C., the company said.
   ``The last thing we wanted for our lodging product is to be
confused with some hamburger chain,'' said Gerald Petitt, executive
vice president and chief operating officer for Quality Inns.
``We'll change the name to eliminate any chance of anyone being
confused.''
   Last September, Quality Inns, based in Silver Spring, announced
the new chain of economy hotels to be marketed under the name
``McSleep Inns.''
   Three days later McDonald's demanded that the name not be used.
   After repeated warnings from McDonald's, Quality Inns filed suit
against the hamburger chain, asking the court to declare that
``McSleep'' does not infringe on the chain's trademark. Quality
Inns said the ``McSleep'' name was selected because it connotes a
clear impression of value.
   McDonald's counter-sued Quality Inns in U.S. District Court in
Baltimore, charging that the use of the name constitutes an
infringement and that the public will confuse the hotels with
McDonald's.
   Niemeyer heard the case without a jury in July.
   ``The court has reaffirmed the rights of our customers not to be
confused or mislead by companies trying to profit from our name and
image,'' Chuck Rubner, a McDonald's spokesman, said Friday.

   Hurricane Gilbert roared northward
today, weakened but still flinging tornadoes and sheets of rain at
thousands of shuttered evacuees along the Texas-Mexico border and
threatening flash flooding inland.
   At least 70 people have been killed and more than 800,000 left
homeless since Gilbert ripped through the Caribbean and Mexico with

   But by this morning, the once massive hurricane's maximum

   There is no evidence that the alarm, which warns of a false flap

   Broken trees and traffic lights
littered city streets Saturday, but many residents were just happy
to have homes to return to.
   More than 5,000 people left shelters around town early Saturday
after the main force of Hurricane Gilbert passed through Mexico
about 100 miles to the south.
   ``I'm kind of glad to be back home. I didn't know what I was
going to find. My house is 80 years old and I thought it was going
to be blown away but it wasn't,'' said Odilon Gracia, 75.
   He said he waited out the storm at an elementary school with a
leaking roof and wet floors. ``I feel a little better in my house
than at that school,'' he said.
   While the shelters emptied, the city grew congested. Restaurants
and food stores closed for two days opened their doors again. Cars
lined up at gas stations.

   Officials predicted disaster and
talked of fingerprinting those who stayed behind to identify their
bodies. Gulf coast residents from Grand Isle, La., to this
tip-of-Texas town boarded up their windows and fled.
   But in the end, it was Gilbert, ``the storm of the century,''
who stayed away _ turning out to be too big to turn north, too
gracious to blast the U.S. coast.
   ``We were waiting for the storm, but it never showed up,'' said
Francisco Garcia as he used a crowbar to pry plywood off his
family's barbecue hut. ``Some people are mad a little bit that they
spent money and the hurricane never showed up.''

   George Bush has dropped a line from his stock
campaign speech: the one about being the underdog and liking it.
   Little more than a month ago, the vice president was trailing
Democrat Michael Dukakis in national public opinion polls by double
digits. Now, most polls show Bush has seized the agenda and is
either leading Dukakis or is even with him.
   Political professionals offer differing explanations for Bush's
rapid rise. But most suggest a combination of factors: his
well-received convention address, a series of speeches that put
Dukakis on the defensive, and the failure of questions over running
mate Dan Quayle's military record to stick as a major liability.
   Some analysts also cite quick damage control on the part of
Bush's campaign team, led by campaign chairman James A. Baker III,
in minimizing possible embarrassments _ such as the quick
resignations last week of Bush operative Frederic Malek and six
members of an ethnic coalition after allegations of anti-Semitic
activities surfaced.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis, declaring
Republican George Bush has provided ``zero protection for the
environment,'' proposed Saturday elevating the Environmental
Protection Agency to a Cabinet department.
   ``And the first secretary of the Environment is going to be as
committed to protecting the environment as George Bush has been to
neglecting it,'' the Democratic presidential candidate told a
cheering crowd of campaign workers.
   Dukakis drew a roar of approval from several hundred volunteers
when he referred to rhetorical flubs by the Republican ticket.
   ``Dan Quayle doesn't know what century he's in and George Bush
can't remember the Pledge of Allegiance,'' he said.
   From California, Dukakis flew to Washington, D.C., to share the
spotlight at the annual Congressional Black Caucus dinner with
Jesse Jackson.

   Radical students demonstrating against
the Olympic Games and the government have seen their support
dwindle to a handful of diehards, and most Koreans have rejected
their violent extremism.
   The radical movement has lost ground as hope grows in South
Korea that political reforms will end the nation's long tradition
of authoritarian rule and produce an enduring democratic system.
   Many Koreans, including a growing number of students, say
violent anti-government protests are no longer necessary. People
are increasingly critical of the radicals.
   Demonstrations against the Olympics, which began Saturday, have
been small by Korean standards with the turnout dropping each day.
Protests have been confined to campuses away from the Olympic
venues and many have been peaceful.

   Japan operated a secret chemical weapons factory
during World War II, bombed China with poison gas grenades and
tested poison on prisoners of war, including Americans, a new
report charges.
   The report in the October issue of the Chicago-based Bulletin of
the Atomic Scientists also contends the U.S. government knew about
Japan's use of chemical weapons but failed to prosecute Japanese
officers at the Tokyo war crimes tribunal in 1946.
   The report's author, Yuki Tanaka, speculated the U.S. government
decided against prosecuting because it wanted to learn from Japan's
knowledge of bacteriological warfare.
   Tanaka, a lecturer in Japanese at the University of Adelaide in
Australia, drew on newly discovered Japanese war documents, his own
interviews and previously published material to piece together the
account, said Len Ackland, the Bulletin's editor.

   Rep. Ken Gray says that in his southern
Illinois district, support for the National Rifle Association is
almost as strong as for the Pledge of Allegiance.
   So when the NRA told Gray's constituents to make sure he voted
against a waiting period for handgun purchases, they responded.
   A week ago, they surrounded his car in the district and
virtually kept him prisoner inside until he promised to help strip
the waiting period from an anti-drug bill.
   They repeated verbatim all the NRA arguments _ especially the
fear that this was the beginning of the end of gun ownership.

   Subscribers to Index on Censorship got a surprise
this month. Instead of the usual reports of suppression of free
speech by dictatorships, the entire issue of the small but
respected journal was devoted to Britain.
   It reflected growing alarm among editors, broadcasters and civil
libertarians that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government is
adding censorship to Britain's already extensive official secrecy.
   From repeated attempts to suppress news about Northern Ireland
to a worldwide government campaign to ban the publication of an
intelligence veteran's memoirs, the list of recent controversies
over media freedom has grown dramatically.

   The Organization of American States, facing
the worst financial crisis of its history, may be forced to lay off
as many as 300 of its 1,000 employees over the next few months,
according to OAS sources.
   The crisis is based largely on the Reagan administration's
decision to reduce its 1988 contribution to the OAS by $10 million
and by the same amount next year. Compounding the problem is the
failure of several other major contributors, including Chile and
Venezuela, to keep their payments current, the sources said.
   The impending layoffs have generated gloom and uncertainty among
OAS employees, most of whom are Latin Americans who are faced with
the prospect of the immediate loss of their U.S. visas if their
jobs are eliminated.

   ``He was so ugly he had to sneak up on
breakfast,'' one tale-spinner said, as ``Once upon a time ...''
took on a down-home flavor out at the eighth annual Northern
Appalachian Storytelling Festival.
   Storytelling often has been relegated to the children's hour at
libraries, storytellers said at the weekend event at Mansfield
University in north-central Pennsylvania.
   But now they said they are in demand for everything from therapy
for emotionally disturbed children to corporate picnics.
   Jimmy Neil Smith, director of the National Association for the
Preservation and Perpetuation of Storytelling in Jonesboro, Tenn.,
said the number of full-time professional storytellers has
increased from about a dozen in 1973 to 200 or more.
   Attendance at the National Storytelling Festival, held each
October since 1973 in Jonesboro, has grown from 60 to more than
5,000, Smith said. Mansfield's festival was expected to draw 500
people this weekend, up from 50 when it started.

<HEAD>Land Costs and Traffic Jams Change Face of Historic Center</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND DE LIGNY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rising land costs and traffic
jams of modern Amsterdam are changing the face of the ``Canal
Belt,'' the city's cultural and economic core since the middle of
the 14th century.
   The industry that has operated there for centuries has moved to
the suburbs, leaving behind a 35-percent employment rate in the
area and bringing yuppy-like gentrification and skyrocketing rents
to neighborhoods that hadn't changed much since the 17th century.
   The latest and the last of the industries to depart was Klene's
candy factory, which had permeated its neighborhood with the
distinct aroma of licorice since it opened in 1915.
   Klene's factory moved to a modern, $9.5-million plant in Hoorn,
20 miles north.
   ``We left for a number of reasons, but the catastrophic traffic
situation here was the most important one,'' said Hans Hilarius,
Klene's managing director.
   The company serves about 10 percent of the Dutch licorice market
with yearly sales amounting to the guilder equivalent of $4 million.
   As Klene's output more than tripled over the past decade,
getting the ingredients _ mainly sugar and starch _ in and the
licorice and peppermint out became an almost impossible task
because of the Canal Belt's old narrow streets, Hilarius said in a
recent interview.
   ``The daily average was five 20-ton trucks with raw materials
and the finished product a day,'' said Hilarius. The trucks had to
run an obstacle course of traffic jams on the 8-foot wide street
along the Looiersgracht Canal.
   Industrial activity within Amsterdam's city center had been
declining since the mid-1960s, when the city developed huge
industrial zones in the deep-water port area west of the city.
   But development of the industrial zone was stunted by the 1973
oil crisis recession.
   Instead of industrial giants coming in, it was small to
medium-sized businesses that took refuge from heavy traffic and
high land leases in the city-owned industrial zones. City leases,
which serve as a sort of real estate tax, have increased from the
equivalent of $1.20 a square foot in 1978 to $4 now.
   An Amsterdam Chamber of Commerce survey indicated that during
the last eight months of 1986, more than 800 such firms moved out
of the 2.3-square-mile Canal Belt, taking with them them some 2,200
jobs.
   Among the major departures was the Heineken brewery, which
shifted its main brewery to Zoeterwoude, 25 miles south of the
capital, and kept only its head office and a demonstration plant
for tourist tours in the capital.
   ``It worries us greatly that 35 percent of the city center's
work force is now unemployed,'' said Chamber of Commerce chairman
Rob de Vilder, ``and most of the companies that left employed
low-grade labor.''
   Amsterdam's average unemployment rate is 18.4 percent, well
above the national figure of 14 percent. Klene's 85-member work
force was made up of unskilled laborers.
   Hilarius said he unsuccessfully tried to buy city land for a new
plant in the cramped city center. City Hall spokesman Harald Ytsma
said, however, no municipal land had been sold since 1896, when the
city adopted a lease-only policy to have tighter control over land
use.
   Part of the area's unemployment problem stems from the
traditional reluctance of Dutch workers to commute to jobs outside
their own cities, with the majority of the commuting class white
collar employees.
   De Vilder of the Chamber of Commerce minimizes the problem of
industry abandoning the city center, saying other, smaller business
are taking its place.
   ``The city is losing lots of unskilled jobs, but on the other
hand, thousands of small businesses are opening their doors every
year,'' he said.
   ``What is industrial activity? In our view, a small computer
repair company also is industrial activity, and such firms abound
in the inner city.''
   That shift has prompted a gentrification that is turning
historic working-class neighborhoods like the canal-woven Jordaan
into upscale neighborhoods.
   With most city jobs now in the banking, commerce, media and
tourism sectors, De Vilder says, unskilled workers should be
induced to commute to out-of-town jobs.
   But blue collar attachment to inner city neighborhoods is often
stronger than the draw of jobs in a strange city.
   One elderly Jordaan woman signalled that bittersweet attachment
when she told a new white-collar neighbor, ``If it weren't for
people like you, my son could afford to live in this neighborhood.''

   As the season approaches for yearend tax
planning, investors face the possibility that some standard,
time-tested strategies might not work so well this year.
   In normal circumstances, the main idea in yearend maneuvering
for tax purposes is to minimize the tax liability from investments
you would incur for the current year's tax return.
   To do that, you could use any one of several techniques for
postponing realization of capital gains until the new year arrives.
   In addition, you might sell an investment that has performed
poorly before yearend, taking a loss to offset profitable sales
made earlier in the year or to reduce your other income by as much
as $3,000.
   Advisers on tax matters have traditionally urged their clients
to take these steps early, so as not to be caught in the
late-November and December rush.
   But thanks to the elections, the federal budget deficit and the
possibility of additional changes in the tax code before too long,
many of the experts are hesitating to make the usual
recommendations right now.
   As Standard & Poor's Corp. put it in its advisory publication
The Outlook:
   ``Keep in mind that shifting investment gains forward to 1989
could be the wrong move if tax rates rise next year, a possibility
that certainly can't be ruled out.
   ``On the other hand, the next tax hike could come in a package
that would lower capital gains tax rates.''
   Adds William Brennan, a Valley Forge, Pa., adviser on tax and
investment planning, ``Ingrained in our subconscious is the notion
we must delay income taxes as long as possible.
   ``1988 may be the year to purge ourselves of this preconception
_ the 28 percent tax rate won't last forever.''
   The idea of postponing tax liabilities rests on a solid
foundation known as the time value of money. The longer you can
legally put off the time of reckoning, the longer you have the use
of the money and its earning power.
   Many long-term investment strategies are geared to delaying
taxes until after you retire, when you presumably fall into a lower
tax bracket than you occupied in your peak earning years.
   The problem is, the virtues of tax postponement come into
question when you do not know what future tax rates will be.
   No matter what is said during the presidential election
campaign, many financial observers believe ``revenue-raising''
proposals will be made next year because of the need, mandated by
law, to narrow the federal budget deficit.
   Nevertheless, some observers say, there is a case to be made for
waiting longer than usual to decide on 1988 tax strategies _ if you
think, or hope, that the rest of the campaign and the results of
the Nov. 8 elections will help to clarify the tax outlook for next
year and beyond.
   No matter what the future may hold, there is a natural human
tendency to want to reduce the current year's tax burden, if only
for the emotional satisfaction that comes with a refund in the
spring.
   For investors planning to sell losing investments before
yearend, experts offer the reminder that they must avoid what the
Internal Revenue Service calls a ``wash sale.''
   If you sell an investment, and repurchase it within 30 days
(either before or after) the date of the sale, the loss from the
sale does not qualify for any deduction.
   In the unusual environment that prevails this year, tax advisers
agree, one old precept still applies: While tax planning is
important, short-term tax considerations should never become so
paramount in your mind that you permit them to lead you astray from
your long-term plans and goals.

   Living in this coastal town, Elwot Avery
learned to pay careful attention to the weather, and on the
afternoon of Sept. 21, 1938, his nose told him to expect an
``autumnal sou'wester.''
   It soon became clear it was something much worse. Trees were
already down when a two-car garage was lifted by the winds before
his eyes.
   ``It went up whole, like a kite, and flew on over the tops of
the trees and smashed in the road just like so much kindling
wood,'' recalls Avery, now 89.
   Impelled beyond reason to see more, Avery left his wife and
stepped outside.
   His hilltop home had become an island; neighboring houses were
swamped in 5 feet of water. The wind nearly blew him off his feet.
He crawled back on his hands and knees.
   The Great New England Hurricane of 1938, which had turned inland
virtually without warning, was the worst natural disaster to hit
the region. Its torrential rains, 30-foot waves and 186 mph winds
pulverized granite seawalls, twisted railroad tracks like spaghetti
and leveled whole forests.
   Moreover, the storm was aimed like a giant wrecking ball at the
most densely populated part of the country, the so-called Gold
Coast between New York and Boston. It wiped out 4,500 homes and
badly damaged 15,000 other buildings, smashed 26,000 cars, sank
6,000 boats and tore down nearly 20,000 miles of electric lines.
   The death toll was generally calculated at 580 killed, 100
missing. Nowhere was it heavier per capita than in Westerly, a town
of barely 20,000 inhabitants today and fewer then.
   Within hours of the storm's passing, the old Westerly High
School became a temporary morgue where bodies _ eventually more
than 100 _ were brought for identification.
   Avery, as owner of a funeral home, was put in charge. Since all
the telephone lines were down, he got a ham radio operator to order
a truckload of caskets. Then he worked round the clock for three
days _ ``living on tomato soup and whiskey'' _ to bury the dead.
   Among them was his own mother, whose beachside cottage had been
smashed to pieces by huge waves. The last time anyone saw her
alive, he says, she was standing in the surf holding the handle of
a suitcase. The suitcase itself had been torn away by the wind.
   There were similar scenes of terror everywhere the hurricane
struck, from Long Island to Maine.
   As the waves swept through downtown Providence, people ran for
higher ground. Some drowned in the streets.
   Claire Powell, who was 9 years old, remembers the terror she
felt when her father did not come home that night.
   ``It turned out he climbed a light pole and hung on until he was
rescued,'' she says, still exuding relief 50 years later.
   Short circuits caused by flooding set off the worst fire that
New London, Conn., had seen since Benedict Arnold and the British
torched the city in 1781. The flames quickly consumed 30 buildings
and threatened the entire business district.
   Firefighters, floundering in water above their waists, watched
in frustration as the hurricane blew the spray from their hoses
back into their faces. Only a shift in the wind saved the city.
   Across the region, the storm cut power, transportation and
telephones, isolating whole communities. In Somerville, Mass.,
physicians delivered babies by candlelight.
   As the Connecticut River rose 25 feet and spilled over its
banks, 10,000 people were evacuated from low-lying areas of
Springfield, Mass.
   After the flooding came looting. Fall River, Marlboro and
Northampton, Mass., were under martial law. National Guardsmen with
fixed bayonets patroled Providence and Westerly.
   But there were also many instances of heroism.
   The New Haven Railroad's Bostonian express was trapped, with 600
aboard, by floodwaters at a trestle near Stonington, Conn. Hulks of
cottages and boats slammed against the cars. Passengers screamed as
the train swayed dangerously.
   The engineer ordered everyone into the first car and the tender
of his locomotive. Wading into shoulder-deep water, he uncoupled
the other cars, then climbed back aboard and opened the throttle,
nudging aside a house that had been tossed onto the tracks and
driving the locomotive inch-by-inch across the buckling trestle to
safety.
   On open water, it was a rare boat that was able to ride out the
storm. In Somerset, Mass., a 600-foot oil tanker was tossed ashore.
In Warwick, R.I., the wind picked up a 30-foot sloop like a toy and
deposited it 40 feet above the ground in the branches of an elm,
where it remained perched and little damaged.
   Katherine Phillips of Providence was blown half-a-mile across
Narragansett Bay clinging to a wooden door.
   Mary Haggerty of East Providence looked out the window of the
small office building where she was working and realized it was
floating in the Seekonk River. She made her way to the roof as the
building swept toward the India Point Bridge. At the moment of
impact, she grabbed the bridge's rail and held on.
   In Hartford, the clock in the Old State House stopped at 4:10
p.m. An 80 mph wind, the highest recorded in the city, tore off
roofs, uprooted trees and toppled buildings.
   In Boston, the historic frigate Constitution was ripped from its
moorings and damaged. Throughout the city, windows bent, then burst
out toward the wind, showering the streets with glass. Some 2,000
injuries were reported.
   The hurricane's damage, in 1938 dollars, was estimated at $400
million _ the equivalent of several billion dollars today. But some
observers believe its effects went well beyond damage to property
and loss of life.
   ``It has been described as an act of God in an age of
innocence,'' says Everett S. Allen, who covered the storm as a
reporter for the Standard-Times of New Bedford and wrote a book
about it, ``A Wind To Shake the World,'' in 1976.
   ``We lived at that time with a general sense that things would
always remain largely as they were. What the storm proved, at first
blush, was that landmarks do not have to endure,'' he says.

<TEXT>
   A little past 1 a.m. on Sept. 30,
1938, in the headquarters of the Nazi Party here, the leaders of
Germany, Britain, France and Italy signed the Munich Pact and told
the world war had been averted.
   ``I believe it is peace in our time,'' trumpeted Prime Minister
Neville Chamberlain of Britain.
   A year later World War II started.
   Instead of being ``appeased'' by the dismemberment of
Czechoslovakia, as the Munich Pact provided, Germany's Adolf Hitler
invaded Poland.
   The pact was, in fact, one of the great stepping stones toward
war.
   A half century later, world politics is still being shaped by
the lessons learned, the lessons unlearned and the lessons
forgotten from the Munich Pact.
   ``The sort of attitude _ `Let's not have another Munich' _ has
become a way of thinking about international politics, particularly
on the more conservative side,'' said Reinhold Meyers, a West
German political scientist and specialist on the Munich Pact.
   Meyers added that is at least partially reflected in the
continuing mistrust between East and West.
   ``Munich has become a sort of ideological catchword because it
stands for a policy of capitulation,'' Meyers said in an interview.
   The Munich talks were a last-ditch attempt, led by Chamberlain,
to appease Hitler's militaristic craving for ``Lebensraum'' (living
space) and avoid war.
   Hitler was threatening to invade Czechoslovakia, which would
have triggered an immediate European war because of France's
commitment to protect the Czechs and Britain's alliance with the
French.
   ``The Munich Pact was not only one of the most important steps
leading to World War II, but it has also become a symbol of
successful political blackmail,'' said Hermann Graml, a top West
German historian.
   Chamberlain, Premier Edouard Daladier of France, Hitler and his
ally in Italy, dictator Benito Mussolini, began the Munich
Conference on Sept. 29, 1938.
   Czechoslovak leaders were excluded as Hitler demanded.
   The site of the talks, a long, three-story, barracks-like
structure built just three years earlier, still stands and is a
music school.
   But Hitler's private office, where the four leaders met,
disappeared long ago in postwar renovations.
   Firsthand accounts of the four-power meeting describe the Nazi
leader as extremely volatile and ready to wage war if he wasn't
given Czechoslovakia's German-speaking Sudetenland.
   ``Hitler was in a crude and rude and aggressive mood _ a very
unattractive character,'' the British statesman Lord Home, who
accompanied Chamberlain as his aide, said in a recent interview
with The Associated Press at his estate in Scotland.
   Daladier, writing years after the meeting, said of the start of
the discussions: ``Hitler arose and delivered a diatribe against
the Czechs. It was a real explosion. Spreading his arms or
clenching his fists, he accused the Czechs of a frightful tyranny
over the Sudeten Germans.''
   Historians say Hitler had used the argument of
self-determination for Czechoslovakia's minority Germans as a
propaganda device to justify his claims upon the bordering nation.
   ``What he really believed in was the right of supposedly
racially superior Germans to dominate other people,'' Graml, a
Munich University professor, said during an interview at his office.
   At one point during the discussions, Chamberlain objected to
Hitler's stipulation that Czechs who would evacuate their nation's
11,000-square-mile Sudetenland, an area slightly larger than
Maryland, could not even take their cattle.
   Paul Schmidt, Hitler's translator during the conference, wrote
in later years that the Nazi leader responded impatiently: ``Our
time is too valuable to be wasted on such trivialities.''
   Chamberlain dropped the matter.
   Faced with a hostile Nazi leader who appeared ready to throw all
of Europe into war if he didn't get what he wanted, the Munich Pact
was signed.
   Leaders from all over the world welcomed the agreement and what
looked like a last-minute escape from war.
   But Winston Churchill said the pact had shamed his country.
   ``You were given the choice between war and dishonor,''
Churchill told Chamberlain later. ``You chose dishonor and will
have war.''
   Hitler was given the Sudetenland, but it quickly became obvious
he had no intention of keeping his vow to be satisfied with just
that.
   In March 1939, German troops overran the rest of Czechoslovakia.
   Six months later German troops marched into Poland, and soon the
world's major powers, including France and Britain, were embroiled
in a war that did not end until Nazi Germany's defeat in May 1945.
   Many modern-day historians, like Meyers, say Chamberlain had no
choice but to sign the Munich Pact, arguing that Britain could not
have withstood a major war at that time.
   ``The British could not afford to go to war in September 1938
because of the negative status of its air force, and they had
hardly any expeditionary force at all,'' said Meyers, a professor
at Muenster University.
   But the Munich Pact has left a lot of bitter memories.
   Some French historians say the Munich accord may be one reason
there has never been a strong French pacifist movement since World
War II.
   ``Politically, mentally, pacifism was killed by Munich,'' said
Jean-Pierre Azema, a historian at Paris' Political Science
Institute.
   The Czechoslovaks, the sacrificial victims of the Munich Pact,
also have bitter recollections of the infamous accord.
   Czechoslovakia was rebuilt after World War II and Communist
leaders were installed.
   This past February, Milos Jakes, Czechoslovakia's new Communist
Party leader, defended the Communist takeover in 1948 as a
guarantee that the nation's alliance with the Soviet Union had rid
it of dependence ``on imperialist states, for which a tragic price
was paid after Munich.''
   But Hitler's invasion was replayed 30 years later with the
Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia that crushed the 1968
``Prague Spring'' reform movement.

   With loyalty unshaken by hindsight,
Lord Home, Neville Chamberlain's aide at the 1938 Munich Pact talks
with Adolf Hitler, defends an episode long ranked among the most
shameful in British history.
   ``Chamberlain decided to continue with this peaceful diplomacy
in order to try to persuade Hitler that war would be a tragedy not
only for Germany, but for Europe,'' Home (pronounced Hume) said in
an interview as the 50th anniversary of the Munich Pact approached.
   ``He thought that Hitler must be sufficiently reasonable to
understand that.''
   Chamberlain bought peace, but Hitler quickly overran all of
Czechoslovakia and started World War II with his invasion of Poland
in 1939.
   Winston Churchill, Chamberlain's successor as prime minister in
1940, sharply assailed his predecessor for signing the Munich Pact.
   Chamberlain died haunted by the words he blurted out to cheering
crowds outside No. 10 Downing St. on Sept. 30, 1938, as he
brandished the piece of paper he'd brought home that day.
   ``I believe it is peace in our time.''
   Home, who as Sir Alec Douglas-Home served as prime minister
himself in 1963-64, sticks to a generous judgment of the leader he
served as parliamentary private secretary from 1937 to 1940.
   ``If you are a prime minister leading a democracy and you want
the nation to go united into a war, then you've got to carry
diplomacy as far as you conceivably can,'' Home said in the
interview at his 50-room estate, Castlemains.
   Home, at 85, is still active politically as a member of the
unelected House of Lords.
   Self-effacing and impeccably mannered, Home recalls both the
chilling details and the vain hopes of the face-to-face talks with
Hitler.
   ``Hitler was in a crude and rude and aggressive mood _ a very
unattractive character,'' he said.
   ``But Chamberlain was concerned to get this bit of paper out of
him, which he'd drafted that morning himself, saying that Britain
and Germany would settle their differences by peaceful means, so a
bit of that short time was taken up with that.''
   The rest consisted of allowing Hitler to annex the Sudetenland
from Czechoslovakia, which the Nazis overran entirely the following
March. Six months later German troops marched into Poland and
Chamberlain finally declared war on Sept. 3, 1939.
   Chamberlain, Home said, never expressed any regrets about the
Munich Pact, but knew he'd blundered with his ``peace in our time''
remark.
   ``As soon as he said the words, he knew that he'd made a mistake
because it was an unjustifiable claim,'' Home added.
   ``He'd gone back to Downing Street from the aerodrome. The
crowds were enormous. I was inside, we were packed like sardines,
and I heard somebody on the staircase say to him, `Well, Neville,
go up to the historic window and say peace in our time.'
   ``And he turned on whoever it was _ I couldn't see who is was _
and said, `I don't do that kind of thing,' ... and somebody in the
next four or five yards must have said, `Oh, Neville, look at the
crowd, go on, do it.' And that's how it happened.''
   Home said the justification for Munich is that it saved a vital
year for British air rearmament.
   ``It could have made all the difference between victory and
defeat.''
   To Churchill, who replaced Chamberlain as prime minister in May
1940, Britain ``chose shame'' at Munich.
   ``We have sustained a defeat without war, the consequences of
which will travel far with us along our road,'' he declared in the
House of Commons.

   When Premier Edouard Daladier returned to France 50
years ago after signing the Munich Pact with Adolf Hitler, Neville
Chamberlain and Benito Mussolini, he received a delirious hero's
welcome.
   In most French eyes he had saved their country and averted war.
   But today, for many French citizens the Munich Pact and the name
Daladier are synonymous with appeasement, even cowardice. It also
may be one of the reasons why the pacifist movement has never
gained much ground in France.
   ``To criticize somebody as a ``Munichois'' is an insult,'' said
Jean-Pierre Azema, a historian at Paris' prestigious Political
Science Institute. ``Somebody who lacks courage is called
Munichois.''
   Yet, at the time, the agreement that gave Czechoslovakia's
Sudetenland to Germany was approved by 60-65 percent of the French
people, despite French military accords with the Prague government
in force since World War I.
   But the French themselves became the victims of Hitler's
ambitions when the Nazis occupied France in 1940.
   Daladier, then minister of war, was interned by the
collaborationist Vichy government. In 1943 he was taken to Germany
and imprisoned until the end of the war.
   Daladier never recovered politically. He died in 1970, having
never again held office.
   ``Even though his attitude during the war was irreproachable, he
never recuperated politically because of Munich,'' said Azema.
   The Munich generation is now in its twilight years. The majority
of today's Frenchmen have no firsthand memory of the times, its
dangers, its fears, its politics.
   Nonetheless, Munich remains a strong symbol.
   ``I have the impression that it rendered the French
non-pacifist,'' said Azema, noting stronger movements in other
European countries.
   ``Politically, mentally, pacifism was killed by Munich. No
French politician can support a pacifist policy, a pacific policy
yes, but not a pacifist policy.''

   The son of Benito Mussolini remembers that Italy's
fascist dictator, like Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain of
Britain, thought the Munich Pact of 1938 had saved the world from
war.
   ``I remember he came home from Munich and said, `Peace is
safe,''' said Vittorio Mussolini, who was 22 when his father went
to the Munich Conference.
   But Giovanni Spadolini, the Republican president of today's
Italian Senate and a professor of contemporary history at the
Univeristy of Florence, said the Munich agreement to cede the
Czechoslovakia's Sudentenland to Germany ``generated negative
beliefs within the dictatorships and within the democracies.''
   ``Hitler was convinced that France and Great Britain would never
have gone to war to defend the Eastern states,'' said Spadolini.
   ``Mussolini, who had taken a role that was unnatural for him,
that of the apostle of peace, was convinced of playing a
determinant role within the Axis. Above all, Munich contributed to
the infusing in him the ... conviction that the British were
decadent and faint-hearted and could be provoked without impunity.''
   Said Bruno Bottai, the secretary general of the Italian Foreign
Ministry: ``Munich was also the last conference in which the
destiny of other peoples was decided in an abstract, arrogant way.
   ``Then, people thought they could still solve war and peace with
political agreements, now we try to deal with this through the more
complex mechanism of the United Nations, together with the concept
of armaments reduction, which is new and more complex.''
   Sen. Gaetano Arfe, a member of the independent left who also is
professor of history of parties and political movements at the
University of Florence, said the advent of the atomic bomb marks a
great difference between then and now.
   ``At the time, one could aim for war. Now this is no longer
possible. ... The European countries can no longer have autonomous
foreign policies. These have to lie within the systems of NATO and
the EEC (European Economic Community).''
   Bottai said Italian diplomacy at the time was against an
excessive alignment with Germany. The Munich conference was seen as
a chance to widen the dialogue with France and Britain, he said.
   ``Unfortunately that was an illusion, which lasted for a short
time,'' he said.

<HEAD>AP SPOTLIGHT: Munich Pact _ Bitterness still in Czechoslovakia</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: One of a five-story package</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Half a century after the Munich
Pact dismembered their country, many Czechs still feel they were
betrayed by nations they thought were their allies.
   British, French and Italian leaders joined Adolf Hitler in
Munich, Germany, in September 1938 to sign a pact allowing the
Nazis to swallow the German-speaking Sudetenland. The following
year, Hitler occupied the remainder of Czechoslovakia as well and
the nation no longer existed.
   ``In the history of nations there are events ... which even
decades later bring about strong feelings of patriotism,''
historian Jan Anger wrote in his book ``Munich 1938,'' published in
Prague this past August.
   Czechoslovakia's president in 1938, Edvard Benes, had relied on
a treaty with France and the loyalty of Britain to protect his
country from Hitler's fascism.
   Britain and France were the country's two main allies on which
Czechoslovakia had modeled its democracy.
   In a 1947 biography of Benes, Compton Mackenzie wrote: ``What
finally broke Benes' heart was the betrayal of France.''
   Bitter feelings have lasted long after the end of World War II
and the reconstruction of Czechoslovakia, including the
Sudetenland, under Communist leadership.
   Milos Jakes, who became the Communist Party leader in December,
said in February that the 1948 Communist takeover guaranteed an
alliance with the Soviet Union instead of dependence ``on
imperialist states, for which a tragic price was paid after
Munich.''
   However, many Czechs and Slovaks have felt equally betrayed by
their Soviet allies.
   Many of them are younger people who are bitter about the
Soviet-led invasion 30 years later to crush the ``Prague Spring''
of reforms.
   On the 30th anniversary of the Munich Pact in 1968,
Czechoslovaks were reeling from the shock of the Warsaw Pact
invastion Aug. 20-21 that crushed the reform movement of Alexander
Dubcek, the Communist Party leader at the time.
   On Aug. 21 of this year, thousands of mostly young Czechoslovaks
turned out on Prague's Wenceslas Square to protest the 1968
invasion. An estimated 10,000 demonstrators chanted ``Dubcek'' and
demands for truth and freedom.
   While bitter about Munich, Czechoslavaks see the Nazi era as
being over and West German visitors today are warmly welcomed in
Czechoslovakia.
   ``We usually hate the most those we have loved the most, and
vice versa,'' said one long-time political observer who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   ``Look at the eager welcome given to the thousands of West
Germans swarming the streets of Prague today. One could almost
forget the way they (Germans) came to this country 50 years ago.''

<HEAD>The Lure of Dividends Return</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the stock market acts like a bull, many
investors concentrate on capital appreciation and all but forget
dividends.
   The reason why is hardly complex, since almost anyone is likely
to be attracted to a one-day leap of $1 a share vs. a dividend that
might amount to less than that for an entire year.
   But when the market stalls, as it seems now to be doing,
interest in dividends returns. Newsletter writers tout
high-dividend stocks and brokers offer clients their lists of
prospects for dividend increases.
   When the talk is about dividends, you know the spirit of the
marketplace has changed, that it has become calmer, more realistic,
more attuned to economic conditions and, most likely, healthier.
   Smart investors, however, never lose interest in dividend
yields, even when others are talking about huge one-day profits and
the promoters are talking about a new era and new levels of
prosperity.
   The dividend collectors, however, know that over the long run
they sometimes can make more in dividends a bit at a time than
others might make _ and lose _ in sharply fluctuating prices.
   Investment Information Services, one of the new-breed market
researchers who rely on cold, hard, provable data in contrast to
the emotions, promotions and shenanigans that predominated from
1982 to 1987, offers this evidence:
   _Over the past 38 years, the total return on the Standard &
Poor's 500-stock index has averaged 11.4 percent. Of this, 4.6
percent came from dividends, the rest from capital appreciation.
   _Reinvestment of dividends over a long period of time can boost
an investor's wealth enormously. Little dividends become big sums
when compounded; that is, when dividends reinvested earn dividends
themselves.
   If you had invested $1,000 in the S&P beginning in 1926, and
withdrawn all dividends during that time, your investment would
have been worth $19,366 by the end of 1987.
   But, had you reinvested all the dividend payments so that they
in turn could earn dividends, your portfolio during the same time
would have grown to $347,956.
   Such evidence is not new, but it still arrives with a shock on
the current market scene, having been scorned for years by a public
that believed a stock puchased in the morning should show a gain by
afternoon.
   Dividends cannot do that, since seldom are they offered more
than once in three months. Moreover, you must pay taxes on
dividends, whereas you can defer any tax on capital gains until you
sell.
   There are other reasons, too, why dividends fall out of favor
during bull markets, chief of them being the notion that
dividend-paying companies are too plodding, too conservative, too
slow-growing.
   But when the marketplace returns to its senses, as it probably
has now, the beauty of dividends returns to its proper place in
investment philosophies.

<HEAD>The Fuel Economy Debate: It Cloaks a Welter of Concerns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's automakers, their regulators and
their critics agree on this: There is more to fuel economy than
saving gasoline.
   On a single mile per gallon, to hear the interested parties tell
it, hangs the U.S. trade balance, the ability of the domestic auto
industry to compete, the nation's energy independence, thousands of
highway traffic deaths, even the capacity of the Earth's climate to
support humankind.
   A welter of comment offered at hearings this past week lead to
those assorted conclusions. It now falls to the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration to weigh those competing interests
and issue a decision on where fuel consumption standards ought to
be set in the future.
   In many respects, fuel economy is a 1970s issue hitching a ride
on the concerns of the 1980s and the 1990s.
   Beginning in 1972, oil producing nations, mainly in the Middle
East, raised oil prices dramatically. Congress in 1975 responded
with legislation to reduce the nation's reliance on foreign oil by
forcing Detroit to build more fuel-efficient cars.
   The law phased in a minimum gas mileage each manufacturer on
average must attain. The corporate average fuel economy _ shortened
to CAFE and pronounced like a small eatery _ is calculated on the
basis of gallons of gasoline used by a maker's domestic car
production over the estimated life of the vehicles.
   The CAFE standard in 1985 reached 27.5 mpg. The next year it was
lowered to 26 mpg by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration after some of the automakers argued that, for
technological and commercial reasons, they could not meet the
stricter standard.
   The standard was scheduled to revert to 27.5 mpg with the 1989
model year. NHTSA in August proposed setting the CAFE standard
through 1990 somewhere between 26.5 mpg and 27.5 mpg.
   General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. oppose setting the
standard at the higher end of the range. They said they could live
with a 26.5 mpg standard, but the question is one of trade and jobs.
   To meet a 27.5 mpg CAFE standard, the two largest U.S.
automakers said they would have to restrict production of large
cars.
   The result, they said, would be layoffs at large-car assembly
plants. The job losses would cascade through the manufacturers'
suppliers and into the general economy, ultimately numbering in the
hundreds of thousands.
   Analysts buy the argument that the stricter fuel-economy
standard would pinch GM and Ford.
   ``I think you would have more problems, because Americans want
to buy horsepower and big cars,'' said David Healy, an analyst with
the New York brokerage house Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ``It
probably wouldn't be a disaster; it would be more of a pain for the
companies than it is now.''
   A pain for GM and Ford would be a boon for the foreign
automakers, particularly the Japanese, and detrimental to the U.S.
balance of trade, both the automakers and analysts said.
   Large and luxury cars accounted for about 19 percent of the 5.2
million domestic cars sold in the United States this year through
August, according to industry reports.
   All but one of those models were made by GM and Ford. Chrysler
makes one big car. Most imported cars are smaller vehicles.
   Even if the U.S. makers restricted big-car production, they
would still make some of the high-profit vehicles, thereby diluting
the average gas mileage of their fleets.
   To offset that production, ``they have to have a lower
performance (small) car than the importers, because the importers
don't have to balance their small cars aginst the higher fuel-usage
cars,'' said Thomas O'Grady, president of Integrated Automotive
Resources Inc. of Wayne, Pa.
   Therefore, even buyers of small cars would tend to gravitate to
higher-performance imported vehicles.
   Against that bread-and-butter question lie other issues, some
divorced from the orginal conservation intent of the law.
   Some want CAFE loosened to lower the highway death toll. The
Competitive Enterprise Institute, a free-market advocacy group,
argued that setting the standard at 27.5 mpg would lead to between
2,200 and 3,900 additional deaths over the life of 1989 cars
because people are more likely to be killed in crashes involving
smaller vehicles.
   Others want the mileage standards tightened in order to protect
the environment. The Energy Conservation Coalition, a group of 20
environmental and conservation grups, argued that loosening the
CAFE standard, by putting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere,
would accelerate the greenhouse effect, a warming of the atmosphere
caused by a trapping of the sun's heat, with disastrous effects for
world's food-growing ability in the next century.
   The Department of Transportation, GM and others point to
gasoline prices averaging 97 cents per gallon, far lower than
forecast during the height of the oil crunch, and say the law has
outlived its original intent and should be scrapped.
   Still others, such as the Center for Auto Safety, a consumers
group often critical of the auto industry and its regulators, say
the conservation issue is still important, with oil imports
standing at 38.1 percent this year, against 36.8 percent when the
CAFE law was passed. A new energy crisis, they argue, is something
for which the nation should be prepared.
   The CAFE decision, the conflicting comment suggests, is a
question of public priorities, a balance between the economic
health of the auto industry and broader political, safety and
environmental concerns. A ruling is expected within a few weeks.

<TEXT>
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _The government said the U.S. merchandise trade deficit showed
the biggest improvement in almost six years in July, shrinking to
$9.53 billion from a revised June deficit of $13.22 billion.
Another report showed a broader measure of U.S. trade, figured
quarterly, narrowed sharply from April through June.
   _Other government economic reports evidenced a slowdown in
growth. Industrial production rose a modest 0.2 percent in August,
while retail sales declined 0.2 percent during the month. The
industrial operating rate for August showed little change, and
business inventories were reported up just 0.3 percent in July.
   _Agriculture Department officials held to an earlier prediction
that consumer food prices would rise an average of only 3 percent
to 5 percent this year, with about 1 percent of the rise attributed
to the summer drought.
   _Sales of U.S.-made cars and trucks fell 9 percent in early
September, but last year's incentives continued to color the
year-to-year comparisons.
   _Nine personal computer makers declared their technical
independence from International Business Machines Corp., with a new
standard for how information will be passed around inside their
machines. Analysts said the new ``bus,'' or data pathway, killed
for good the idea that IBM would control the standards for the next
generation of PCs.
   _Kroger Co., one of the nation's largest grocery chain, said it
was considering a $3.77 billion restructuring plan, which analysts
said was designed to ward off a hostile takeover by Herbert and
Robert Haft.
   _Management officials at Hospital Corp. of America said they
planned a $3.3 billion buyout of the company, one of the world's
biggest hospital chains.
   _Macmillan Inc. agreed to a $2.36 billion takeover by Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts & Co., a private investment firm. But British
publisher Robert Maxwell responded by raising his offer for
Macmillan to $2.41 billion in cash.
   _Consumer-products giant Colgate-Palmolive Co. accepted a
management-led buyout of its Kendall Health Care subsidiary in a
deal that values the business at around $1.1 billion.
   _Playtex Holdings Inc. said it will split into two separate
companies under a series of buyout transactions totaling about $1.3
billion. The deal would separate Playtex' family products
businesses from its intimate apparel operations.
   _Ames Department Stores Inc. said it had agreed to buy Zayre
Corp.'s 388-unit discount store division in a deal it valued at
about $800 million.
   _Armtek Corp. accepted a sweetened $561.2 million buyout offer
from its once-hostile suitor Mark IV Industries Inc., ending a
brief battle for the auto parts maker.
   _American Brands Inc. rebuffed a buyout proposal from an
investor group led by financier Bennett LeBow, who alternatively
requested a chance to buy the company's tobacco businesses.
   _Harvard University said it is raising $30 million to start
companies to commercialize medical research. Administrators said
the plan would raise money needed to supplement Harvard Medical
School's $350 million research budget.
   _Hugh Hefner, the jet-setting founder of Playboy magazine, said
he would give his daughter, Christie Hefner, full command of
Playboy Enterprises.
   _The Senate voted overwhelmingly to confirm investment banker
and former Sen. Nicholas F. Brady as Treasury secretary in time for
a major international meeting in West Berlin.
   _Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress he
sees no need for a blanket ban on mergers of the biggest banks and
securities firms, but he said he would go along with such a ban to
win passage of legislation permitting banks to underwrite
securities.
   _The House moved toward tougher treatment for Wall Street
insider traders, passing legislation that would dramatically
increase fines and prison terms and penalize investment firms where
the practice takes place. The measure's fate in the Senate was
unclear.
   _The General Accounting Office put the cost of bailing out the
savings industry at $45 billion to $50 billion, up about $14
billion from a previous estimate.

<HEAD>Real Traders Enliven Movie Set In Soybean Pit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Four and a half years in the Chicago Board of Trade's U.S.
Treasury bond pit have taught Tom White that the popular image of
futures traders as overnight millionaires is a myth.
   Two days of playing a soybean trader in the upcoming film comedy
``Limit Up'' convinced White that his own perception of Hollywood
movie-making was also at odds with reality.
   Instead of glitter and glamor, White and 13 other real-life
traders from Chicago, who were recruited to add authenticity to the
production, found the experience downright tedious.
   ``You're filming 10 percent of the time and 90 percent of the
time you're standing around waiting for them to set the cameras and
lights,'' White said.
   And those lights were hot.
   ``I was sweating more than I do in the pit I trade in every
day,'' the 29-year-old independent trader said last week during a
break from the hectic pace of the T-bond arena.
   ``Hot'' also could describe the group's performance as soybean
traders whipped into a buying frenzy by rumors of a large Soviet
grain purchase, said director Richard Martini, a Chicago-area
native who also wrote the screenplay for ``Limit Up.''
   ``It just electrified everyone in the company,'' Martini, 33,
said in a telephone interview from the set on the trading floor of
the old Pacific Stock Exchange building in Los Angeles.
   ``The actors were incredibly impressed with their energy and
what these guys do,'' Martini said. ``Some of these guys who came
out here had traded together for 25 years and you just can't get
that from Hollywood.''
   Martini's older brother Robert, a former CBOT trader who served
as a consultant on the production, said the realistically raucous
trading scenes drew wild applause from onlookers.
   ``All sorts of heavyweights were coming over to the set,'' he
said. ``They'd never seen anything like it.''
   The attention was welcomed by White, who said he went to
Hollywood harboring a fantasy of being discovered.
   ``I'm available any time for any other production for any
film,'' he said. ``I'd gladly trade spots.''
   Martini's previous credits include the screenplay for the 1987
comedy ``Three For The Road'' and ``Can't Hurry Love,'' a 1988
release that he wrote and directed.
   ``Limit Up'' stars Nancy Allen, Dean Stockwell, ``Saturday Night
Live'' alumni Brad Hall and Danitra Vance, and Ray Charles. The
movie is being produced by Management Company Entertainment Group
Inc. and is scheduled for release next spring, said MCEG spokesman
Al Newman.
   The movie's title refers to a sharp upward move in the price of
a commodity traded on a futures exchange. Exchanges usually limit
the amount that prices can move in either direction.
   Martini said Miss Allen plays a low-level employee of a trading
company at the fictitious Midwest Grain Exchange who sells her soul
to the devil (Miss Vance) to become a successful soybean trader.
Stockwell plays her arch-rival in the soybean pit and she falls in
love with Hall, who plays a broker. Ray Charles plays God.
   The director said he envisions ``Limit Up'' as a cross between
the Christmas classic ``It's A Wonderful Life'' and ``Trading
Places,'' the 1983 comedy hit about commodities trading that
featured Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd.
   Martini said he asked a friend at the Board of Trade to recruit
some traders for his movie because he wanted to realistically
portray ``the integrity of bean traders, the camaraderie between
them ... how they are like gladiators in the Roman arena fighting
for the world food supply.''
   Despite such high praise, the Chicago contingent returned home
with their visions of Tinseltown a bit tarnished.
   ``Maybe I thought we'd be involved more,'' White lamented.
   ``Hollywood's very glamorous,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a
42-year-old grain trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., ``but the
actual making of fils is very boring.''

<HEAD>Toyota Unit Makes Rare Foray By Japanese into US Public Debt
Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. bond market, which has proven
attractive in recent years for Japanese investors, showed it can be
gracious on those rare occasions when it gets a call from a
borrower affiliated with a Japanese company.
   The market provided a warm reception this past week for a $200
million issue of three-year notes from Toyota Motor Credit Corp.,
the U.S. finance subsidiary of the Japanese automaker Toyota Motor
Corp.
   The notes, sold in denominations of $1,000, were priced to yield
8.826 percent, or a slim 38-hundredths of a percentage point more
than Treasury securities with a similar maturity.
   ``We were very pleased. It went very well and sold out within
one hour,'' said Wolfgang Jahn, vice president for Toyota Motor
Credit in Torrance, Calif.
   He said while the company has no specific plans for additional
offerings, he said he expects to be back.
   According to the research firm Securities Data Co., the sale was
the first straight public debt offering in the United States in 10
years by an affiliate of a Japanese company other than a bank or a
concern controlled by the government.
   The last such issue was the sale a $20 million in five-year
notes by Ito-Yokado Ltd., a Japanese department store company, in
June 1978, according to Fran Wissak of Securities Data in Newark,
N.J.
   Mark J. Lerner, head of the Japan Banking Group at Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets, which led the underwriters of the issue, said
Japanese companies have been deterred from the U.S. debt market
because of Securities and Exchange Commission requirements.
   But he said he suspects other Japanese companies will be
watching the Toyota note sale and may be encouraged to try it as
well.
   A wholly-owned subsidiary of Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. Inc.,
Toyota Motor Credit makes loans to U.S. Toyota dealers and their
customers.
   It has grown rapidly over the past three years, and counts over
$3 billion in accounts receivable on its books, according to Jahn.
   Jahn said the company started out raising money in the
Euromarkets because they offered ready access and cheaper rates,
initially, than the U.S. markets.
   But Jahn said as the company's growth accelerated, it found it
needed to return to the Euromarket more frequently.
   Over the past three years, he said Toyota Motor Credit raised $2
billion in 16 separate offerings and that in recent months, found
itself going back to the market with new offerings every six to
eight months.
   ``We realized that we couldn't raise all our funds in Europe,''
he said. ``It was time for us to enter the U.S. market.''
   Lerner said Merrill Lynch worked for nine months to come up with
documents acceptable to the company and the SEC. He said a
first-time issuer could get into the Euromarkets, on the other
hand, in two weeks.
   Nonetheless, Jahn said Toyota Motor Credit wanted ``to make sure
we have the capability of going into the U.S. market'' to
accommodate the company's expected growth.
   ``It is the deepest and most liquid debt market in the world,''
added Lloyd Misteli, assistant treasurer at Toyota Motor Credit.
   Lerner said he expects Toyota Motor Credit will become one of
the most active issuers in the U.S. debt markets within two years,
joining a group that included the financing arms of the Big Three
U.S. automakers.
   He said other Japanese companies may also decide to start
borrowing here.
   The increasing frequency of Japanese acquisitions in the United
States may accelerate that development as Japanese companies look
for new sources of funds to help them finance those purchases, he
said.
   ``Now that a major leader among Japanese companies has taken
this initial step, other Japanese companies will follow suit,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Wall Street Not Yet Wowed by Signs of Slowing Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the effort to revive the sagging securities
markets of Wall Street, the U.S. economy certainly has been doing
its part.
   Early this year, when stocks were weighed down by fears of a
recession, the economy put on a burst of impressive growth.
   Now, amid worries about inflation and tighter credit, business
activity appears to be obliging by slowing down to a safer, more
sustainable speed.
   But the traders and money managers who make the markets go still
seem unsatisfied. And that has left many observers wondering just
what it is the markets want.
   Consider the government's latest report on international trade,
which read like a prescription specifically written to cure the
markets' ills.
   The Commerce Department figures, issued on Wednesday, showed a
much larger than expected narrowing in the U.S. trade deficit, to
$9.53 billion in July from $13.22 billion in June.
   In the prevailing view of things on Wall Street, the deficit was
headed in the right direction for the right reason _ an 8.9 percent
drop in imports, while exports continued to increase.
   The implication was that the worldwide markets for goods
produced in this country remained strong and that domestic demand
was slowing enough at the same time to cool inflation worries.
   The stock market did indeed rally on the news, but the advance
had a half-hearted ring to it. The Dow Jones average of 30
industrials closed Wednesday with a gain of 17.60 points.
   By the next day, the market was back in the sluggish, drifting
pattern that has predominated since mid-summer.
   ``The initial reports on the economy's health in August were
unexpectedly weak,'' said Maury Harris, economist at PaineWebber
Inc. ``But one month is not a trend.
   ``The erratic course of monthly data suggests it is premature to
conclude that the economy is registering the slowdown from
above-average growth which is a prerequisite for lower interest
rates.''
   Similarly, Donald Straszheim, economist at Merrill Lynch, said
any conclusion about slower growth is ``probably premature.''
   The latest trend in data on unemployment claims, Straszheim
observed, ``suggests that employment growth will pick up in
September and that the unemployment rate will decline.''
   Growth in the gross national product isn't likely to slow until
late this year, he said, and even then it will probably be stronger
than the Federal Reserve wants to see in its campaign to restrain
inflation.
   ``Recent indicators have delayed the next tightening by the
Fed,'' he conceded, ``but the Fed is still likely to tighten
further.''
   In the face of such restraining comments, the Dow Jones
industrial average settled for a 29.34-point gain to 2,098.15 in
the past week.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.97 to 152.79;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market climbed
2.31 to 383.91; and the American Stock Exchange market value index
was up .77 at 298.22.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 165.38 million shares a day,
against 138.17 million the week before.
   Should the economy begin a sustained slowdown that Wall
Streeters accept as the real thing, will that mean clear sailing
for the markets?
   Perhaps, analysts say. But there is also the distinct
possibility that investors will begin to worry in earnest about the
possibility of a recession.
   At some point, more and more investors are likely to question
whether the Fed and other central banks can engineer an
anti-inflationary economic slowdown without bringing on a more
serious slump.
   Says Jeffrey Applegate at the firm of Tucker, Anthony & R.L. Day
Inc., ``The extreme economic risk is recession, not boom.''

   Oil futures prices declined in moderate trading
as the market shifted its attention from Hurricane Gilbert to the
oversupply of oil around the world.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the October contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, settled
33 cents lower at $14.57 a 42-gallon barrel Friday compared with
Thursday's closing price of $14.90 a barrel. Other contract months
also settled lower.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery closed down
1.41 cents at 44.22 cents a gallon compared with 45.63 cents a
gallon on Thursday. The contract rose more than 3 cents on
Wednesday on fears of a hurricane-induced gasoline shortage.
   The October wholesale heating oil contract fell 1.33 cents a
gallon to close at 41.37 cents a gallon, compared with 42.70 cents
on Thursday.
   Analysts said the market opened lower and traded in a narrow
range Friday before weakening at the end of the day along with the
prospects of a disruption in domestic gasoline and crude oil
supplies in the Gulf of Mexico.
   The market had rallied earlier in the week on reports the
hurricane was approaching the U.S. coastline near Texas and
Louisiana and that many U.S. refineries had ceased operations.
   But by Thursday, analysts said the focus shifted to production
concerns as threats of a hurricane doing serious damage dissipated.
By Friday companies which had evacuated workers from oil platforms
announced they were resuming operations.
   ``Once the hurricane is off the front pages, the market will be
back to looking at the supply and demand situation and I don't
think that looks constructive,'' said William Byers, an analyst
with Bear, Stearns & Co.
   Reports this week indicated the 13-member Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries had reduced its production last
month, from 20 million barrels a day to below 19 million, but still
more than the market can absorb, according to analysts.
   That preceded an announcement that the cartel's price monitoring
committee would meet Sept. 25 and 26, suggesting that OPEC might be
serious about setting production limits that would strengthen world
oil prices.
   But on Thursday, Iraqi's oil minister slowed the market's upward
momentum by announcing his country would not lower its oil output
and might raise its production instead.
   ``That dampens any optimism about what could come out of an OPEC
meeting,'' said John Azarow, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc.
   Iraq has refused to abide by its OPEC-assigned quota of 1.5
million barrels a day and is reported to be producing about 2.7
million barrels a day. Some observers hoped that after a recent
cease-fire in its 8-year-old war with Iran, Iraq would join with
other OPEC nations in restraining production.

<HEAD>Business Inventories Rise Slowly In Sign Of Economy's Strength</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: for Saturday PMs</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Investors who had second thoughts after they bought gold as a
hedge against inflation have pushed the price of the precious metal
lower.
   Gold prices continued to tumble Friday, shedding nearly $7 a
troy ounce. The plunge brought the two-day decline in gold prices
to roughly $18 an ounce and left gold at its lowest point since
March 1987.
   Republic National Bank in New York quoted gold bullion at
$411.75 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT.
   Unlike stocks and bonds, gold does not provide dividends. Its
main merit is it keeps its value when paper investments are eroded
by inflation. But inflation has been lower than gold investors had
expected.
   ``These people are disappointed and shocked and adding fuel to
the fire,'' said Steven Pepper, vice president and bullion dealer
at Republic National Bank. ``The more selling that comes in, the
more these people are in a panic.''
   In other markets Friday, stocks gained some ground and the Dow
Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.87 to 2,098.15. The dollar
was mixed and bonds drifted slightly lower in sluggish trading.
   The government said Friday business inventories rose in July at
the slowest rate in 11 months, an indication sales were strong
enough to keep goods from piling up on the shelves.
   The Commerce Department said inventories rose 0.3 percent _ the
smallest rise since one of 0.2 percent in August 1987.
   Economists believe businesses have been intentionally adding to
their inventories in a small way to have a buffer for continued
strong sales.
   Business sales fell 0.2 percent in July, but the decline was not
considered worrisome because it followed a strong 1.4 percent jump
in June.
   ``When you put June and July together, sales are still growing
strongly,'' said James Annable, chief economist of First National
Bank of Chicago.
