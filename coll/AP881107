   Public Order Minister Tassos Sehiotis
resigned Monday after a Greek-American banker indicted in a $30
million financial scandal fled the country, apparently aboard a
yacht.
   The conservative opposition immediately demanded the resignation
of Premier Andreas Papandreou's socialist government, claiming it
was staging a cover-up.
   Banker George Koskotas, 34, disappeared Saturday afternoon. A
police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Koskotas
fled abroad on Sunday, apparently by yacht from the seaside village
of Megalo Pefko, 20 miles from Athens.
   Sehiotis said a warrant had been issued for Koskotas' arrest. One
week ago, Koskotas was banned from leaving Greece pending the
outcome of an official enquiry into alleged financial irregularities
at the Bank of Crete, which he controls.
   Sehiotis, whose ministry was responsible for police surveillance
of Koskotas, said he was resigning ``since such (public order
ministry) omissions ... create an issue of political sensitivity.''
   The scandal has shaken the government because of accusations in
Greek newspapers that senior socialist officials were involved in
illegal deals set up by the Bank of Crete.
   The socialists also have been criticized for permitting Koskotas
to build a multi-million dollar banking and media empire in Greece
since 1984 without adequate checks by the central bank on his
financial background.
   The government last week pledged ``absolute clarity'' in
uncovering the scandal and warned there will be ``no pardons' for
members of the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) who may
be implicated.
   ``The Greek people are left with the conviction that George
Koskotas was spirited away so that he would not speak. The
responsibility goes all the way to the top of the government
pyramid,'' Constantine Mitsotakis, leader of the New Democracy main
opposition party party, said in a statement demanding the government
resign.
   Koskotas was suspended Oct. 20 as chairman of the Bank of Crete
and indicted on five counts of forgery and embezzlement.
   Last week Koskotas appeared before a district attorney on a
charge of forging documents purporting to show that the Bank of
Crete had $13 million invested with the American brokerage firm
Merrill Lynch.
   He was not detained but given until Nov. 14 to prepare his
defense.
   Koskotas also is accused of forging documents purporting to show
his bank had another $17 million in an account with an American
bank, Irving Trust Corp. Both U.S. firms have said they had no
record of the deposits.
   Koskotas, who holds both American and Greek citizenship, bought a
controlling interest in the Bank of Crete in 1984 after working in
its central Athens branch for six years as an accountant.
   Rival newspapers have claimed Koskotas illegally used Bank of
Crete money to fund his publishing group Grammi, which controls
three daily newspapers, five magazines and a radio station.
   Koskotas resigned Oct. 29 as chairman of Grammi, the day after
the premier's son, Education Minister George Papandreou, denounced
as a forgery a Bank of Crete statement showing a $2.3 million
transfer to a Merrill Lynch account in his name.
   The younger Papandreou showed reporters a letter from a New York
lawyer saying there was no record at Merrill Lynch of such a
transfer.
   Koskotas' parents, brother, wife and five children all have left
Greece during the past week.

   Two police officers who entered a
pro-Solidarity church in Gdansk drunk during a Mass and offended
worshippers have each been sentenced to more than a year in prison,
the official PAP news agency reported.
   The officers behaved rudely in St. Brygida's Roman Catholic
church, a center for the banned Solidarity trade union movement,
during the July 22 service and physically attacked people who tried
to evict them, worshippers reported at the time.
   PAP said in its report Monday that one of the officers was
sentenced to 1\ years in prison, the other to one year and two
months for ``insulting religious feelings of the believers.''
   The officers, who were not identified, were also fined the
official equivalent of $167 each by the Gdansk court, PAP said.
   Poland is more than 90 percent Roman Catholic.

   Police arrested 377 people, including prominent
pediatrician and social activist Benjamin Spock, on Monday in the
culmination of a long series of protests on Capitol Hill called to
focus attention on the plight of the homeless in America.
   ``We're here to show the politicians that there is a crisis in
America, a crisis that they are not responding to, a crisis that we
want answers for,'' said Mitch Snyder, a Washington advocate for the
homeless and organizer of the protests.
   Snyder led a march and 90-minute rally across Constitution Avenue
from the Capitol building, capping the event with his exhortation to
the crowd to sit down in the middle of the street and be arrested as
way of showing concern for the homeless.
   Some 377 followed Snyder's appeal and were arrested by police on
charges of disorderly conduct and obstructing traffic on Capitol
grounds, said Dan Nichols, a spokesman for the Capitol police.
   The protest and arrests had been coordinated with Capitol police
and were generally quiet. About 2,000 persons attended the rally,
Nichols said.
   One of the speakers was the Academy Award-winning actress Cher,
who had originally taken part in the march to the Capitol from a
motel five miles away. She left the march to promote her new line of
perfume, ``Uninhibited,'' but returned to the rally in a black van
limousine. She left shortly before the arrests began.
   ``I'm sorry I'm late, but I had to go do my job,'' she explained.
``I'm here to show my concern and my support for the homeless. I'm
very committed to the cause of the homeless. People have to have it
brought into their consciousness that the plight of the homeless is
very serious.''
   Snyder, of the Community for Creative Non-Violence, organized a
series of protests beginning Sept. 26 to call attention to the
plight of the homeless. Carol Fennelly, a member of the organization
who also joined in the fast, has been bedridden and did not
participate in Monday's protest.
   A total of 239 people have been arrested by Capitol police during
the protest, Nichols said. Most were charged with unlawful entry.
   The rally took on the trappings of a political gathering, with
dozens of people in the crowd sporting ``Dukakis-Bentsen'' buttons
and signs in support of the Democratic presidential ticket. No signs
in support of Vice President George Bush, the Republican
presidential nominee, were apparent.
   ``We've already seen what Bush can do during the eight years of
the Reagan administration,'' said Snyder. ``Whoever wins the
election, it will be a long fight to improve the situation for the
homeless, but I think it will be easier if Dukakis wins.''

<HEAD>Lawmakers Predict Next President Will Face New Children's TV Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers angered by President Reagan's veto of
a bill to limit advertising in children's TV programs say Congress
will be back next year with another, possibly tougher measure.
   Reagan killed the bill late Saturday night with a pocket veto,
even though the measure had overwhelming support in Congress.
Critics likened his action to ``ideological child abuse'' and called
his administration ``morally bankrupt.''
   Reagan said the bill to impose ad limits and make children's
informational programming a condition of station license renewals
would violate constitutional guarantees of free speech and might
discourage commercial networks from financing quality children's
programming.
   But Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., co-author of the bill, said
the veto was another example of the administration putting
``commercial considerations and ideological precepts ahead of
children's interests.''
   ``The president's actions represent a victory for the toy and
cereal hucksters, but a major defeat for our nation's children,''
said Markey, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce
telecommunications subcommittee.
   Rep. Matthew J. Rinaldo of New Jersey, ranking Republican on the
subcommittee, said Reagan acted on bad advice in killing the measure.
   ``It was a rather conservative piece of legislation with a
minimal amount'' of regulation, far less onerous than earlier
proposals that were considered but set aside in favor of the
bipartisan compromise, he said.
   ``Next year, whoever is president will be faced with a tougher
bill and a more determined Congress,'' Rinaldo predicted.
   The measure would have limited advertising in children's shows to
10{ minutes per hour on weekends and 12 minutes per hour on weekdays.
   The Federal Communications Commission had imposed similar limits
on broadcasters but scrapped them four years ago in the belief that
self-regulation by the industry would determine what was best for
children.
   The bill also would have required TV broadcasters to provide
educational and informational programming for children as a
condition of license renewal.
   The Senate approved the measure on a voice vote last month. The
House passed it by a margin of 328-78 in June.
   Reagan said that while he supports efforts to improve the quality
of children's programs, ``this bill simply cannot be reconciled with
the freedom of expression secured by our Constitution.''
   He said, ``the Constitution simply does not empower the federal
government to oversee the programming decisions of broadcasters in
the manner prescribed by this bill.''
   Children's television advocates had pushed for the bill because
they said that under the FCC's philosophy of deregulation,
children's TV has become overcommercialized and the quality of
programs has suffered.
   Peggy Charren, president of the Cambridge, Mass.-based Action for
Children's Television, which has worked 20 years for passage of the
measure, said she was ``flabbergasted'' by the veto.
   ``Here was a bill that was not going to raise the deficit, not
going to raise taxes, was going to get a little bit of education for
children ... and what Reagan said was you don't have to do anything
for children. I call it ideological child abuse,'' she said.
   The measure was a bipartisan compromise that had been stripped of
proposals to outlaw shows, called ``program-length commercials'' by
critics, that feature toy manufacturers' products and to require
broadcasters to air an hour of educational programming per day.
   The final measure had the tacit support of the broadcasting
industry after the National Association of Broadcasters lobbied
effectively against the stronger versions of the bill.
   Edward O. Fritts, president of the NAB, said that ``while we
recognize this legislation charted some new territory, we were
willing to accept its outcome.''
   The veto puts back on track an FCC inquiry into the
commercialization of children's TV. The commission is considering
whether it is necessary to impose advertising limits and regulate
program-length commercials and interactive toys that respond to
inaudible signals beamed through TV sets.
   But lawmakers and children's TV advocates say they do not expect
the current FCC to depart from the Reagan administration's
philosophy of deregulation.

<HEAD>Education Secretary Wants To Be Hispanic Role Model</HEAD>

   On a recent trip back to Texas, Education
Secretary Lauro Cavazos insisted on shaking hands with every student
who goes to school on the huge ranch where he was born.
   As they filed past the first Hispanic member of a president's
Cabinet, the son of a ranch hand told each child how he too had once
studied in the tiny schoolhouse nestled among the prickly brush and
mesquite trees on the King Ranch.
   ``You can do it if you just stay in school,'' Cavazos told them.
   ``When we talk to young people about opportunity through
education, it helps to have a man at the top who proves through his
own life and experience that the American system of opportunity
through education works,'' says Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
   Cavazos was born on the King Ranch, which is the largest in the
United States and covers 914,000 acres in South Texas. The ranch,
which includes parts of six counties between Harlingen and Corpus
Christi, is the bedrock of one of the nation's biggest oil and gas
fortunes and is credited with the development of the Santa Gertrudis
cattle breed, the first native to this country. Darwin Smith,
chairman and chief executive of Kimberly-Clark Corp., is chairman of
the privately held ranch.
   Cavazos, who began his schooling along with other cowboys'
Spanish-speaking children at the ranch, became education secretary
on Sept. 20.
   His nomination by President Reagan to replace William J. Bennett
from a list of Latino candidates was criticized by Hispanic leaders
as a political ploy to bolster Republican presidential nominee
George Bush in the Hispanic community.
   Rep. Albert Bustamante, a San Antonio Democrat and chairman of
the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said at the time: ``It seems that
the administration has just discovered that Hispanics exist.''
   But he praised Cavazos, the president of Texas Tech University
and its medical school since 1980, as ``well respected, well
prepared, with a history in education that is second to none.''
   Cavazos will serve until Jan. 20 unless reappointed by the next
president and brushes aside questions about the next turn in his
career, saying he reached his life's goal when he became a full
professor.
   He is firm in insisting no deal has been struck for him to remain
in the Cabinet if Bush wins on Tuesday, but speculation is strong
that Cavazos would be asked to stay.
   Cavazos has campaigned for the Republican ticket in trips that
include visits to local schools, and emphasizes the need to keep
students from dropping out and to educate the illiterate,
handicapped and dyslexic to their fullest potential.
   In Texas, he says, 45 percent of Hispanics don't finish high
school, while the rate for blacks is 32 percent. The national
average is 28.5 percent.
   While economic troubles, early marriage, drugs or alcohol are
blamed for the Hispanic dropout rate, Cavazos sees those as merely
symptoms of an unraveling family structure unable to give children
the support and confidence they need.
   ``If the family structure is tight and intact and if it values
education, if it really wants to see these young people move ahead;
I think therein is the fundamental problem. ... If that family
structure is not a good, tight structure that supports education and
encourages education and raises the vision of young people and says
`Yes son, yes daughter, you will educate yourself,' ... they can
fall into the social ills I talked about.''
   Cavazos credits his parents _ a cattle foreman and a homemaker
who never went to college _ with encouraging their five children to
get degrees. One son, Dick, became a four-star Army general, and
another, Bob, was an all-America running back who now owns a ranch.
   A father of 10, Cavazos' voice fills with emotion when he recalls
graduating from Texas Tech with his bachelor's degree.
   ``I was so proud, so proud, when I looked at my father when I got
my baccalaureate degree,'' he says. ``And his pride in me when I
went up the academic ladder there was so clear.''

<HEAD>Voluntary Safety Programs Fail To Reduce Fishing Deaths</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Coast Guard's voluntary safety programs
have failed to reduce the number of accidents and deaths in the
nation's most dangerous industry, commercial fishing, says the
National Transportation Safety Board.
   The two agencies are about to lock horns again over the issue,
with the NTSB pressing for mandatory licensing of captains and
mandatory safety training for crews.
   Coast Guard officials insist their voluntary programs already
have reduced the number of fishing boat accidents and fatalities, a
contention disputed by the NTSB.
   ``Despite the Coast Guard statement that fishing vessel casualty
rates for 1986 and 1987 have decreased, safety board accident
investigations indicate that major marine fishing vessel and
property loss rates have not decreased from January 1978 until July
1988, and the death rate has increased in recent months,'' the NTSB
said in a recent report.
   The report focused on the sinking of the Seattle-based fishing
vessel UYAK II in the Bering Sea almost a year ago. Two crew
members, including the captain, were rescued but the bodies of four
others were never recovered.
   The NTSB said the 115-foot vessel began to list, but it was not
equipped with a general alarm system that could have alerted the
crew to the problem.
   In the report and in a mid-October letter to Coast Guard
Commandant Paul Yost Jr., the safety board once again urged the
Coast Guard to seek congressional approval for a series of mandatory
regulations including captain licensing, vessel inspection and crew
safety training.
   ``We laid out what we think needs to be done, but our
recommendations have no force of law,'' said Ted Lopatkiewicz, an
NTSB spokesman.
   The NTSB says the fishing industry has the poorest safety record
of any industry in the nation and the death rate for fishermen is
seven times the national average for all industry groups.
   From January 1978 to April 1987, the safety board investigated
207 major fishing accidents which involved the loss of 147 lives and
a total property loss of more than $165 million.
   That breaks down to 1.8 accidents, $1.4 million worth of property
loss and 1.3 deaths per month.
   This year, Congress did approve legislation requiring commercial
fishing vessels to carry such basic safety equipment as life rafts,
survival suits and emergency transmitters.
   The Coast Guard has 90 days to respond to the latest NTSB
recommendations, most of which it has rejected outright over the
past three years.
   For instance, since early 1986 the Coast Guard has at least three
times rejected the recommendation that it seek authority from
Congress to license fishing vessel captains.
   ``Before taking the more radical step of requiring these masters
to be licensed, the voluntary program should be given a chance to
demonstrate how effective it can be,'' the Coast Guard said in a
letter to the NTSB in March.
   The Coast Guard said casualty rates declined in 1986 and 1987 and
``in our view, part of this improvement may be attributed to the
voluntary program.''
   The Coast Guard also said mandatory licensing would require 225
new employees, cost $9 million to set up and $800,000 a year to run.
   Lopatkiewicz said agencies often are reluctant to adopt NTSB
recommendations and that it takes time to win them over.
   ``We hope eventually they see the light,'' he said, adding that
because it has only the power of recommendation the NTSB sometimes
has to ``regulate by raised eyebrow.''

<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The days of champagne and plastic roses are
coming to an end in Jordan, a country running short of imported
money to pay for imported goods.
   The government Saturday imposed taxes and restrictions on imports
aimed at saving $200 million a year in foreign currency for this
country of 2.8 million people.
   ``We started developing a champagne budget on a beer pocketbook
... This is why (the economy) has to be adjusted,'' said a senior
government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The belt-tightening move appeared to be the first step in what
the official said would be a three- to five-year period during which
Jordan hopes to slash its $6 to $7 billion foreign debt.
   The government banned new letters of credit to finance cars and
trucks, video recorders, refrigerators, microwave ovens, television
sets, chandeliers, marble, plastic flowers and fruit, and a dozen
other goods.
   Finance Minister Hanna Odeh announced on television Sunday night
that banning chandeliers alone will save $3 million.
   Goods already financed were slapped with stiff import duties,
sending the price of some TV sets up 40 percent. To help cushion the
blow, the government cut electricity and water bills.
   The blacklist targets the posh Western lifestyle many Jordanians
adopted in the early 1980s, when their country was flush with money,
much of it imported by hundreds of thousands of Palestinians with
Jordanian passports who worked in the Persian Gulf.
   ``It will touch the conspicuous consumer class, which
unfortunately we have developed,'' said Kamel Abu Jaber, a political
scientist at the University of Jordan. He noted that ``the large
masses of people'' would not be affected by the restrictions.
   Some officials have said privately that the economy has been hurt
by King Hussein's decision in July to renounce sovereignty over
Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which Jordan
governed from 1948 to 1967.
   Plans to remove their citizenship and give them two-year instead
of five-year passports led some Palestinians to withdraw savings
from Jordanian banks because of the uncertainty of their status in
Jordan, one official said.
   One Western diplomat who requested anonymity estimated that
nearly 30 percent of Jordan's currency is held by Palestinians in
the West Bank and the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip.
   The new restrictions also follow a slide in the value of Jordan's
once- stable currency, the dinar, which was worth about $3 last
year, drifted to about $2.66 last month and is now hovering around
$2.
   Bankers said the effective devaluation would help curb imports by
raising their prices.
   More than half of the residents of Jordan are in a sense imports
themselves _ families from Palestine, which is now Israel, who fled
as refugees from their homeland in 1948 and 1967 and were granted
citizenship.
   Many went to work in the gulf during the oil boom of the late
1970s. They sent a total of more than $1 billion back to families in
Jordan, or through Jordanian banks to relatives in the West Bank.
   The other mainstay of Jordan's economy, Arab aid, has also been
slipping. About $360 million a year have come from Saudi Arabia
since 1979, but other Arab states have fallen short of the total
$1.25 billion a year in aid they pledged to Jordan as a state on the
front line with Israel.
   Since 1982, the slumping oil market also has been responsible for
the reduction in foreign capital.
   But most Jordanian bankers and analysts seemed optimistic about
the long-term prospects for a country rich in educated manpower.
   ``We've been living beyond our means and I believe that right now
we have to adjust,'' said Jawad Anani, an economist who heads the
Royal Scientific Society in Amman.
   With the new policies discouraging imports and encouraging
greater production, ``there's a very good chance for Jordanians to
pull out of this,'' he said.

   Astrophysicist Fang Lizhi is happiest pondering
the mysteries of the universe, but he has become embroiled in the
more worldly affairs of politics by fearlessly speaking out against
China's communist government.
   Fang, 52, has emerged as China's top dissident by publicly
championing democracy and questioning Marxism in this one-party
state.
   ``We hope we have a good government, but there is no guarantee,''
says the Beijing Observatory professor with the easy manner and
impish smile. ``The only guarantee comes from people's pressure.''
   ``I like to speak freely,'' he said in a recent interview in his
airy Beijing apartment. ``I think I just show ... we have the right
of speech.''
   Fang emerged during pro-democracy student demonstrations that
rocked major Chinese cities in late 1986 and early 1987. Authorities
said speeches he gave to students at the University of Science and
Technology in Hefei helped incite the protests.
   When China's leaders cracked down on the protests, Fang was
kicked out of the Communist Party and fired from his university post.
   The demonstrations died down, but Fang refused to be silenced.
   Since his purge, he has given a series of interviews to foreign
journalists, criticizing one-party rule and claiming Marxism is
outdated and widely unpopular. No other Chinese of his stature has
dared to publicly launch such attacks on the system.
   During a summer visit to Australia, Fang mentioned rumors that
many Chinese leaders and their children maintained foreign bank
accounts. Chinese authorities, reportedly displeased with his
statements, subsequently withdrew permission for Fang to travel to
the United States later this year.
   Fang said he does not regret any of his comments and will
continue to speak out. ``I'm a soldier who already crossed the
river,'' he said. ``There's no way to turn back.''
   Authorities are reluctant to allow Fang to speak before an
audience, even on non-political topics, he said.
   At an informal gathering on the Beijing University campus to mark
the school's 90th anniversary in May, he was treated like a hero by
several hundred students who came to hear him speak on science and
democracy. When Fang was leaving, a crowd formed around him and
students thrust forward books, envelopes, handkerchiefs and even
money for the professor to sign.
   Letters of support come to Fang almost daily from around the
country. He says they encourage him to continue his activities.
   The last person to embody support for democracy in China was Wei
Jingsheng, a former electrician at the Beijing Zoo. He was sentenced
to 15 years in jail in 1979 on charges of supplying military secrets
to a foreign power and agitating to topple the Chinese communist
system.
   The government, however, generally has attempted to show leniency
toward Fang in an effort to improve the country's image.
   When reporters last year suggested his apartment on the Beijing
University campus was too small, authorities immediately gave him
new quarters about twice the size.
   ``They want to use me. I know that,'' Fang said. ``On one side
they don't like me, they criticize me. (On) the other side, they
want to show they are open.''
   The official Beijing Review in May published a lengthy feature on
Fang and other official media ran articles about his scientific
work. But the Hong Kong-based newspaper South China Morning Post
says Chinese publications recently were instructed not to mention
the professor's name.
   Fang was born to the family of a postal clerk in the southern
coastal city of Hangzhou and was admitted to Beijing University in
1952, at age 16, to study physics and nuclear reactor theory.
   He became one of China's pioneer researchers in laser theory and
won international attention with his research in cosmology, the
study of the universe.
   Fang said his break with Marxism began over cosmology.
   According to the professor, former Politburo member Hu Qiaomu had
questioned the need to study cosmology since Marxism already
maintained the universe was infinite.
   ``This is an open question right now,'' Fang said. ``In
cosmology, Marxism is not right.''
   Fang lives with his wife, Li Shuxian, a professor of physics at
Beijing University, and the younger of their two sons in an
apartment about 780 square feet in size _ huge by Beijing standards.
   A poster of Albert Einstein hangs near the entrance and the
apartment has a new personal computer and a video cassette recorder
_ both rare items in China.
   Fang, who earns $73 a month, receives $2,688 a year for research.
He devotes much of his energy to writing scientific papers, and the
14 published this year include ``Physics and Beauty'' and ``Why
Doesn't the Universe Go Into Heat Death?''

<DATELINE>ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American medical school in
Grenada has fallen on hard times in the five years since invading
U.S. troops evacuated its students and flung the once-obscure school
into the news.
   St. George's University School of Medicine, whose students
President Reagan said were saved from becoming hostages of a Marxist
government, is still turning out doctors on this lush tropical
island at the southern tip of the Caribbean.
   The 11-year-old private school now boasts 1,390 graduates
licensed in 45 U.S. states, and clinical training programs at
hospitals in New Jersey, New York and Britain.
   But as one of several so-called offshore schools in the region
catering to to students rejected by U.S. medical schools, St.
George's is straining from a steep decline in the overall number of
young people going into medicine.
   Since the invasion of October 1983, enrollment at the school's
two Grenada campuses has plunged from 480 to 226. It has cut its
work force from 120 to 90 and put expansion plans on hold. Tuition
has nearly doubled _ to $17,000 a year from $8,700 in 1983.
   A few years ago, St. George's accepted only one of every 10
applicants. Now it's taking one of every two.
   ``The caliber of our students has declined; I'll be candid about
it,'' Chancellor Charles R. Modica, said in an interview. ``But the
American medical schools' pool of applicants has gone down.''
   Despite the fall in enrollment, St. George's still has 33
full-time professors, down just two from 1983, and 44 part-time
visiting professors, down four. Officials say the school is in no
danger of closing.
   ``There's no thinking in that respect,'' said spokesman Arthur
Massolo. ``It's alive and kicking, and we intend to keep it that
way.''
   The U.S. medical establishment has long denounced St. George's
and other offshore medical schools as ``diploma mills,'' but
teachers and adminstrators say St. George's students are highly
motivated and score well on qualifying exams.
   ``My kids get as good training in gross anatomy as they can get
anywhere in the world,'' said Dr. John B. Christensen, chairman of
the Department of Anatomy, who held the same post for seven years at
the University of Missouri at Kansas City.
   ``We could sell diplomas,'' he said, ``but a diploma does not
permit you to practice medicine. You still have to take
board-qualifying exams.''
   Modica, a New York lawyer, founded St. George's at the age of 29
after being rejected by four U.S. medical schools and spending a
fruitless year in Spain trying to become a doctor.
   The school grew steadily but attracted little attention until the
United States decided to overthrow a radical pro-Cuban junta that
seized power and murdered left-wing Prime Minister Maurice Bishop.
   In justifying the invasion, Reagan said the students at St.
George's, most of whom were Americans, were in danger of being taken
hostage.
   They were evacuated in army helicopters by some of the 6,000 U.S.
Marines and paratroopers who landed on the island Oct. 25, 1983,
along with a token Caribbean force.
   A stately bronze monument bearing the engraved signatures of the
19 U.S. servicemen killed in action reminds visitors St. George's
main campus on Grand Anse Beach was once a war zone.
   Initially, school officials strongly opposed the invasion, saying
Grenada's rulers assured them the students would not be harmed. But
within days, they changed their minds.
   Modica says today that he was briefed at the State Department and
shown documents of discussions within the revolutionary government
that persuaded him the students might have been taken hostage.
   ``After the briefing, I felt that there was some justification
for military action,'' he said. ``It was a close call, and I
wouldn't have wanted to make the decision.''
   Modica said enrollment peaked around the time of the invasion and
has been falling for the past 2{ years.
   The reason, he said, is the medical profession, with its long,
hard years of training and costly malpractice suits, has become much
less attractive to American graduates over the past decade.
   Applications to U.S. medical schools have dropped from 42,624 in
1974 to 28,123 last year, with the biggest decline occurring over
the past four years, according to the Asssociation of American
Medical Colleges.
   As a result, the nation's 127 accredited medical schools are
opening their doors to students who just a few years ago would not
have qualified, officials say. And that has shrunk the pool of
applicants for schools like St. George's.

   Knox White wants the good people of South
Carolina's 4th Congressional District to think of him every time
they hear George Bush's name _ a strategy many Republican hopefuls
are pursuing this year.
   White, 34, a city councilman from Greenville, S.C., is trying to
oust freshman Democratic Rep. Liz Patterson in a district that the
GOP presidential nominee is expected to sweep.
   So White's speeches and advertisements are studded with
references to the vice president and, like Bush, he repeatedly
pledges to oppose tax increases, protect jobs and battle illegal
drugs.
   ``Every Republican south of Washington, D.C., is linking himself
to George Bush,'' says White's campaign manager, Bob Knight.
   Maybe so. But on the eve of what national polls indicate is
likely to be a Bush victory over Democrat Michael Dukakis, few
people expect either candidate to provide much of a boost to more
than a few House hopefuls.
   Politicians and observers unanimously expect the House to remain
solidly Democratic, whatever the presidential race's outcome. And
they agree that if Bush wins and if he pulls GOP House contenders to
victory at all, it is likely to be in only a handful of races
scattered across the country, mainly in the conservative South.
   ``As George Bush does better, it helps the image of the
Republican Party,'' says North Carolina GOP chairman Jack Hawke, in
whose state there are four tight House races. ``But in the past we
just haven't seen coattails that significantly in North Carolina.''
   For the coattail effect to work, a presidential candidate must be
so appealing that he draws large numbers of people to the polls who
dutifully vote for other candidates of the same party.
   But in recent decades, strict party-line voting has been going
the way of candidates who lack blow-dried coiffures.
   Beginning with President Eisenhower's re-election in 1956, more
than one quarter of the country's 435 House districts have voted for
one party for president and the other party for its representative.
In 1984, such ticket splitting between the presidential and House
candidates occurred in 196 districts, or 45 percent.
   ``Most House races are pretty insulated from the presidential
election,'' says spokeswoman Peggy Connolly of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee.
   The reasons are many. Increasing numbers of voters identify
themselves as independents, and often decide congressional races on
local issues, not national ones. And incumbents of both parties
usually enjoy insurmountable fund-raising advantages and represent
districts drawn to maximize their re-election prospects.
   Not only do most House incumbents seeking re-election win these
days _ the success rate was 98 percent in 1986 _ but they are doing
it so convincingly that they are usually invulnerable to defeat by
their party's presidential candidate.
   Two years ago, nearly nine out of every 10 incumbents were
re-elected with at least 60 percent of the major party vote, putting
them far out of range of the 1 or 2 percent vote swing that a strong
presidential candidate can bring to House contenders on his ticket.
   ``For there to be coattails this year, it would have to be in a
race that's very close and in an area where Bush will do very
well,'' says Martin Wattenberg, a political science professor at the
University of California at Irvine who studies voting behavior.
``We're talking about a pretty minimal impact there.''
   Political pros on both sides say about a dozen such races do
exist. Besides the contest between White and Patterson _ who
mentions Dukakis' name as infrequently as possible _ others where
presidential coattails might help are Republican Lyons Gray's bid to
oust Democratic Rep. Stephen Neal in North Carolina's 5th District;
GOP Rep. John Hiler's fight to hold off Democratic challenger Tom
Ward in the Indiana 3rd; and Democrat Harry Johnston's fight with
Republican Ken Adams to retain an open Democratic seat in the
Florida 14th.
   But even though Republicans might pick up a few seats this year
that may be attributed to Bush's victory, it is possible that for
the first time since 1960, the party that wins the presidential race
might suffer a net loss of seats in the House.
   That is largely because while the 70 contests considered
reasonably close are split evenly between Democratic and Republican
seats, the GOP holds 15 of the 27 open seats that are not being
defended by an incumbent. Open seats are where turnover from one
party to the other is most likely.
   It is even possible that in a losing effort, Dukakis might still
help Democrats in tight House races in New England, including
Democratic Rep. Fernand St Germain's effort to retain his 1st
District Rhode Island seat against Republican Ronald Machtley, and
Democrat James Donchess's fight for the open GOP seat in New
Hampshire's 2nd District against Republican Chuck Douglas.
   Since the Democrats lost 20 House seats when President Kennedy
was elected in 1960, the party of the winning presidential candidate
has picked up seats in the chamber every four years.
   Since then, the presidential year swings have ranged from the 38
seats the Democrats won in President Johnson's 1964 victory to the
two Democratic pickups that accompanied President Carter's 1976
triumph.

   Jane's defense publishers today expanded its series
with a new volume on riot control, counter-insurgency weapons and
equipment to detect and protect against terrorist action.
   ``The amount of effort and research being put into the defense of
every realm against traditional threats is dwarfed by that going
into the defense of the realm and the populace against the
terrorist, the insurgent, the freedom fighter or the guerrilla under
whatever color of ideological cloak,'' editor Ian Hogg says in his
foreward to ``Jane's Security and Counter-Insurgency Equipment.''
   The new book by the respected defense information publisher lists
equipment in five categories. The firearms section includes standard
infantry weapons as well as guns for specialized security tasks.
   Operational equipment includes land, sea and air vehicles,
surveillance aids such as night vision goggles, thermal imagers,
explosives detectors and robots to set off discovered bombs.
   The riot control section lists a wide range of tear gas devices,
stun grenades, plastic bullets and fragmentation grenades.
   Armor and protection includes bulletproof vests, flak jackets and
even a bulletproof undershirt that won't be conspicuous under a
business executive's shirt.
   The fifth section covers, transmitters, receivers, a fingerprint
identification system, security fences and laser barriers.
   Not only does the terrorist ``have new types of ideology,'' Hogg
says, ``they are familiar with new types of weaponry and in their
ranks are people to whom technology is simply a better method of
vanquishing their enemies. Moreover, they appear to have
inexhaustible reserves of funds and backers with unlimited reserves
of weapons and equipment.''
   The new book was produced by Jane's Publishing Co. Ltd., which
publishes ``Jane's Fighting Ships,'' ``Jane's All The World's
Aircraft'' and a variety of other yearly volumes on military
hardware and other subjects.
   The company also publishes the magazine ``Jane's Defense Weekly.''

<HEAD>Four Sisters Commit Suicide, Fearing Father Can't Afford Dowries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fearing their father could not raise
enough money for their dowries, four sisters in southern India
committed suicide, Indian news agencies said.
   The sisters hanged themselves with their saris from the ceiling
of their house at Alappulli in Kerala state, United News of India
and Press Trust of India reported Sunday.
   The four young women were concerned about the financial problems
their father, a police constable, had after providing a dowry for
their eldest sister, the news agencies said.
   The sisters _ Santha, 25, Sumati, 23, Anaka, 21 and Sasikala, 18
_ took their lives Friday while their father was away on duty and
their mother was working in the family's rice paddy, according to
the reports.
   Last February, three sisters between the ages of 18 and 22 hanged
themselves over dowry problems in the northern state of Uttar
Pradesh.
   Although India outlawed dowry in 1962, the practice of paying the
groom's family is still widespread.
   Many marriages are still arranged by families before the bride
and groom ever meet, and there are frequent reports of young women
being set on fire by in-laws in dowry disputes that continue after
the weddings.
   Such ``kitchen fires'' are reported almost every day by Indian
newspapers. Last year, the government reported 1,572 cases of the
crime, which is known as ``bride-burning.''

<TEXT>
   Forty years after his death, Indian independence
leader Mohandas K. ``Mahatma'' Gandhi has been reinstated as a
lawyer by the legal society in London that disbarred him in 1922, a
member of the society said.
   Gandhi, who protested British colonial rule with a campaign of
passive resistance, was arrested and imprisoned in India several
times in the 1920s. Because of that he was disbarred in 1922 by the
Inner Temple, one of the four Inns of Court with exclusive right to
call lawyers to the English bar.
   Gandhi was reinstated Sunday, the 100th anniversary of the start
of his legal career at the Inner Temple. Patrick Sheehan of the
legal society said the posthumous reinstatement indicated a changed
point of view.
   ``I believe people weren't used to the idea of the revolting
dominions, colonies, seeking their independence in that way,'' he
said.
   Gandhi was assassinated in 1948 by a Hindu nationalist. India
gained its independence the previous year.

<HEAD>VA Expansion Will Cost More Than $9 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Changing the Veterans Administration into the
Department of Veterans Affairs may be relatively cheap as government
programs go, but officials say it will still cost upwards of $9
million over the next decade.
   Much of that money will go for new signs and stationery for the
government's fifth-largest agency, according to officials from the
VA and the Congressional Budget Office.
   But ``given the relative size, the cost impact isn't expected to
be significant, particularly in any one given year,'' said Nina
Shepard, the CBO analyst who helped develop the cost projections.
   When the new department comes into being next March 15, it will
be little different from the current VA, according to Bonner Day, a
spokesman for the agency.
   ``I don't think much has to be done before March 15. The
essential duties have not been changed. The biggest difference is
that the head of the agency will now be a member of the Cabinet,''
he explained.
   The agency won't move from any of its more than 500 buildings
around the country, nor will its operations be greatly affected.
   ``Really, except for the different name and what that requires,
we'll be the same as we are now,'' he explained. ``I don't think you
will see changes day to day.''
   What is required by the name change are new signs _ thousands of
them _ along with stationery with the new name.
   The VA has a $30 billion annual budget, much of which is
disbursed in payments to the nation's veterans. There are about 27
million veterans and 49 million dependents of veterans or survivors,
although only about 2.5 to 3 million use VA services on a regular
basis.
   The bill creating the Department of Veterans Affairs as the 14th
seat in the Cabinet was signed by President Reagan on Oct. 25,
shortly after it had been given overwhelming approval by both the
House and Senate.
   Veterans organizations had long had the bill at the top of their
legislative agenda and said moving the agency into the Cabinet would
elevate the status of veterans.
   The VA is estimating a cost of $9.8 million for the switch,
including $8.5 million for signs and the rest for changing
stationary and the names on veterans publications.
   The signs will have to be changed at the more than 500 VA
buildings around the country, Day said. The VA is still trying to
figure out just exactly how many new signs it will need.
   The VA doesn't plan to change all its signs or buy new stationery
right away, Ms. Shepard said. ``We tried to find out the number of
signs, but they didn't have an exact figure at hand.''
   ``As the old stationary runs out, they will buy new stuff,'' she
said. Similarly, the signs will be redone over the next five years.
   During the congressional debate over changing the VA's status,
some legislators said the total cost might be $33 million, far
higher than the $9.8 million figure.
   But that estimate was for a different bill, which would have
substantially expanded the staff of the agency's inspector general
department, the office which guards against wrongdoing. The bulk of
the additional money would have gone to hire new staff members, Ms.
Shepard said. Those provisions were dropped.

<TEXT>
   George Bush and Michael Dukakis each promise to
cut the federal deficit if elected president, but their proposals
for new programs could put the United States deeper in debt,
economic and political analysts say.
   Each candidate has described or endorsed plans covering areas
from defense to child care that could total billions of dollars in
increased spending if adopted by Congress without offsetting cuts in
other spending.
   ``These guys are going in the opposite direction,'' said
Professor James Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional
and Presidential Studies at American University. ``They're talking
about spending money rather than saving money.''
   Henry J. Aaron, senior fellow in economic studies at the
Brookings Institution, cited ``the failure of both candidates in my
view to deal responsibly with the deficit problem.''
   Bush and Dukakis have expressed concern about the budget deficit,
which was $155 billion in fiscal 1988, which just ended. The
national debt, under $1 trillion when Ronald Reagan took office, is
now more than $2.6 trillion.
   Concerns about the deficit's potential effect on the U.S. and
global economies played a role in last year's drop in world stock
markets and led to an agreement between Reagan and the Congress to
limit spending.
   Thurber said the U.S. budget deficit remains one of the main
concerns to foreign investors, who now are loaning the money to pay
for more than half of the debt and are concerned about the security
of their funds.
   ``They don't have very many other places to send their money, but
they're wondering if they'll ever get their money out of this
situation,'' said Thurber.
   Marvin Kosters of the American Enterprise Institute said new
programs could be adopted without increasing the budget deficit if
other programs are cut, but ``not painlessly, and not without
political conflict, certainly.''
   Aaron said he thinks pressures in Congress will keep any new
programs small and have them ``self-financed'' by eliminating tax
benefits or cutting other programs.
   Dukakis has said he would cut some nuclear weapons, but his
pledge to build up conventional arms could prove ``very costly,''
said Thurber.
   Bush has criticized Dukakis for opposing both the mobile MX and
Midgetman missiles, but acknowledges he cannot afford to press ahead
with both. Bush says Dukakis is naive to let the Soviets know in
advance what missiles he will eliminate.
   Bush's proposals include a $3.7 billion ``Invest In Our
Children'' package aimed at children of low-income families that
would help provide day care, more pre-school education and better
health care.
   Dukakis endorsed the concept, but not the exact dollar amount, of
the $2.5 billion ``A Better Child'' day care bill that failed to win
approval in Congress this year. It would set federal standards and
funnel money to states to expand day-care slots.
   Dukakis wants to spend $100 million on prenatal health care that
he claims would pay for itself in a year because infants born under
the plan would be healthier and require less hospital care after
birth.
   Dukakis also wants to require all but the smallest employers to
offer basic health insurance to workers and their families _ a move
he says will cost the government nothing, but which Bush says
amounts to a new tax of at least $35 billion on those businesses.
Dukakis says his plan would insure 22 million of the nation's 37
million uninsured.
   Aaron said that over time it would reduce tax revenues because it
would shift some income from the taxable category to the untaxable
fringe-benefit category.
   Bush proposes a reduction in capital gains taxes, which would
benefit people with investments in the stock market and elsewhere,
at a cost estimated by the Congressional Budget Office at $3.9
billion a year.
   Bush claims the tax reduction would free up money for more
private investment, creating jobs and stimulating the economy; thus,
in the end it would work toward reducing the deficit, because the
government would have more people paying taxes.
   Bush vows he would adopt ``no new taxes'' and claims he would
eliminate the deficit by putting a ``flexible freeze'' on government
spending to keep total growth at the inflation rate.
   Dukakis says he would increase enforcement of tax collection and
would raise taxes only as a last resort. But ``they're just not
going to get that much more money out of it,'' said Thurber, adding
that the Reagan administration has already increased the number of
agents pursuing tax cheats.

   A barrage of pre-election polls has given George
Bush a lead for popular votes in the presidential contest and an
even greater advantage in the more critical race for electoral votes.
   With Election Day looming, a 50-state poll by ABC News and The
Washington Post put 25 states firmly in Bush's column and another 16
leaning his way. Only the District of Columbia was firm for Democrat
Michael Dukakis.
   Though the poll did not jibe with all other individual state
assessments, it assigned Bush a daunting lead: His 25 firm states
alone would provide more than the 270 electoral votes needed for
election.
   In national popularity, the ABC-Post poll gave Bush a 10-point
lead among likely voters, 54-44 percent. Gallup found Bush up by 12
points, a CBS News poll said nine points and a USA Today-CNN poll
said 11. NBC News-Wall Street Journal and Harris polls found a
closer race, with a 5-point Bush lead.
   The differing results indicated continuing indecision and
dissatisfaction among some voters, factors that can accentuate the
effect of differences in polling dates and methods, such as
identifying likely voters.
   There was room for movement: One in five respondents in the
Gallup and NBC-Journal polls were undecided or said they could
change their minds, and in Gallup's poll only about half of each
candidate's support was strong.
   Gallup, however, said its undecided respondents appeared likely
to split evenly, on the basis of their background and ideology.
   Voter dissatisfaction was clear. Two-thirds in the NBC-Journal
poll said the campaign was one of the worst in recent history, as
many were unhappy with the nominees' discussion of the issues and
six in 10 said they wished other candidates were running.
   As it was, Bush led in most ratings on presidential ability.
Likely voters by 62-25 percent said he would be better able to
maintain a strong defense, and he outranked Dukakis on crime, the
economy and foreign policy.
   The ABC-Post's state-by-state poll underlined the difficulty of
Dukakis' position: He needed to win all his firm and leaning states,
all the tossup states, all the leaning Bush states and at least one
firm Bush state.
   The poll, conducted by re-interviewing most of the respondents in
a 50-state survey in early October, found 17 states moving toward
Bush and only three moving toward Dukakis. The number of states
firmly or leaning for Dukakis actually declined from eight to four.
   The results did not agree with all recent state polls. New York
was rated as leaning to Bush, for example, although a recent state
poll put Dukakis slightly ahead in New York. Washington state also
was said to be leaning for Bush, although a poll there last week put
Dukakis ahead by 10 points.
   USA Today and CNN conducted five separate state polls, finding
Bush ahead in California, 54-45; in Ohio, 58-42; and in
Pennsylvania, 53-46. It was about even in Illinois, 51-48 for Bush,
and Michigan, 51-49 for Bush.
   Although the other new national surveys were not large enough for
state-by-state results, Gallup found the race tight in the East and
Bush leading strongly in all other regions, particularly the South.
The closer NBC-Journal poll found Bush leading well in the South and
West with tight races in the East and Midwest.
   In popularity nationwide, the ABC-Post poll found a slight
decline from a 13-point Bush lead late last month. The other polls
Sunday also found some tightening, although they disagreed on its
extent.
   The ABC-Post poll was weighted to an effective sample size of
1,500 likely voters for the national popularity figure, with a
margin of error of plus or minus three points. Margins of error
varied state-by-state, and ABC made characterizations of the state
results without releasing numbers.
   In addition to the District of Columbia firmly for Dukakis, it
said Hawaii, Massachusetts and Minnesota were leaning his way.
Tossups were Illinois, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont
and West Virginia.
   Leaning for Bush were Alabama, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana,
New York, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, Mississippi, Nebraska,
Nevada, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Washington. The rest were rated as
firm for Bush.
   NBC and the Journal polled 1,721 likely voters Tuesday through
Saturday; Gallup, 1,969 Thursday through Saturday; Harris, 2,114
Wednesday through Saturday; CBS, 1,585 Friday and Saturday; USA
Today-CNN 2,506 nationally and about 500 in each of the five states,
Thursday through Sunday.
   The Gallup and Harris polls had margins of error of plus or minus
two percentage points; the NBC-Journal and CBS polls, three points;
the USA Today-CNN polls, two points for the national sample, four
for the states.
   In addition to the ABC-Post finding of 54-44 percent Bush, the
numerical results were: USA Today-CNN, 55-44; Gallup, 53-41; CBS,
51-42; Harris, 50-45; NBC-Journal, 48-43. All included leaning
voters except the NBC-Journal poll; including them, its result was
50-45.

   Despite a decline in smoking, annual spending
by Americans on cigarettes is climbing and probably will continue to
do so through the rest of this century, says an Agriculture
Department economist.
   ``Manufacturers will face falling domestic volume and will need
to raise prices to maintain profits,'' Verner Grise said. ``Tax
rates of state and local governments will continue to rise. The need
for additional tax revenues is mounting, and tobacco taxes,
especially cigarettes, have been a mainstay of state revenue systems
for many years.''
   Grise, who specializes in tobacco analysis for the department's
Economic Research Service, said that in addition to federal and
state taxes ``a growing number of local jurisdictions are looking to
the same revenue source.''
   Reporting in the agency's latest Agricultural Outlook magazine,
Grise said there have been dramatic changes in the last decade.
   ``Spending for cigarettes is double what it was 10 years ago,''
he said. ``But the rise reflects higher prices, not more use. U.S.
consumption has fallen 10 percent from its peak of 640 billion
cigarettes in 1981. Retail cigarette prices, on the other hand, have
risen about 90 percent since 1980.''
   Most of the increase has been from higher manufacturer and
wholesale prices, and from the boosts in taxes. Prices go up to
maintain or enhance profits as well as to cover rising manufacturing
costs.
   Last year, Grise said, Americans spent about $33.5 billion on
cigarettes, a little more than 1 percent of consumer disposable
income and approximately the same proportion as 10 years ago.
   Cigarette excise taxes totaled about $9.7 billion in 1987,
compared with $6.6 billion in 1980, he said. Federal taxes accounted
for 49 percent, with state and local governments the remainder.
   But looked at another way, total excise taxes only accounted for
29 percent of consumer expenditures on cigarettes in 1987, down from
34 percent in 1980. Grise said that although taxes rose, the
marketing bill for manufacturing, distributing and merchandising
cigarettes increased faster.
   The United States has had an excise tax on cigarettes since 1862,
Grise said, and since 1969 all states have imposed such taxes, along
with an increasing number of local governments.
   Iowa was the first state to impose a cigarette tax in 1921, and
by 1950 40 states and the District of Columbia were taxing
cigarettes. Rates now range from 2 cents per pack of 20 cigarettes
in North Carolina _ the leading producer _ to 38 cents in Minnesota.
Grise said that makes a weighted U.S. average tax of about 18 cents
per pack.
   ``The increase in spending on cigarettes in the 1980s has largely
gone to manufacturers,'' he said. ``The farm value of cigarette
expenditures was actually $100 million less in 1987 than in 1980.''
   Tobacco farmers in 1980 received 7.5 cents of each dollar spent
by cigarette users, but in 1987 growers got only 4 cents, Grise said.
   ``Meantime, the manufacturer's share (of each dollar spent) rose
from 35 cents to 44,'' he said. ``The distributor's share stood at
24 cents in 1980 but retreated to 23 cents in 1987.''
   Federal excise taxes edged to 14 cents of the consumer dollar
last year from 13 cents in 1980. Back in the 1950s and 1960s,
federal taxes accounted for up to 35 cents of each cigarette dollar.
   Grise said state and local taxes rose to more than 20 cents of
each dollar in the 1970s and early 1980s but dropped to about 15
cents in 1987.
   Of about $33.5 billion spent on cigarettes last year, Grise said
the farm value was approximately $1.35 billion; the manufacturing
share, $14.9 billion; wholesaling and retailing, $7.62 billion;
federal taxes, $4.73 billion; and state and local taxes, $4.95
billion.

<HEAD>Democrats Confident of Retaining Senate Lead; GOP Talking Momentum</HEAD>

   Democrats are confident they will keep their
controlling grip on the U.S. Senate no matter which party wins the
White House in Tuesday's election.
   Party organizers even hope to chip away at Republican Senate
seats, perhaps bolstering their 54-46 majority by one or more seats.
   Republicans, however, say the momentum is turning in their favor
in races across the country, while conceding that every tight race
will have to break in their favor if they are to stand even a chance
of regaining the Senate control they lost two years ago.
   Strategists in both parties say an unusual volatility in the
electorate this year adds an element of uncertainty that could lead
to election-night surprises.
   As the campaign moved into its final hours, GOP Senate candidates
in states in which polling has given Vice President George Bush wide
margins over Democratic rival Michael Dukakis have moved to identify
themselves with Bush and his political themes.
   Political money flowed freely. The Federal Election Commission
reported that as of Oct. 19, Senate candidates of both parties had
raised a total of $157.5 million.
   The most expensive race in the country to date: California, where
Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., spent more than $10 million and
Democratic Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy spent more than $5 million. The
race was a tossup on the eve of the election.
   Overall, it appeared to be a good year for most incumbents, who
attracted the lion's share of campaign contributions. In many of
their races it appears to be a case of no contest.
   Most of the 15 Democratic incumbents seeking re-election appear
to be safe, cushioned by leads of 10 or more points. Only three of
the 12 Republicans seeking further six-year terms appear to be in
trouble.
   Among Democrats, late polling showed Sen. Frank Lautenberg,
D-N.J., pulling ahead of former Army Brig. Gen. Pete Dawkins after
weeks of harshly negative campaigning.
   Sen. John Melcher, D-Mont., was locked in a head-to-head contest
with rival Republican Conrad Burns with Melcher recycling television
ads featuring talking cows from his 1982 campaign. In this case, the
cows call Burns a ``greenhorn'' who would be out of his depth in
Washington.
   Among Republican incumbents, strong challenges are being mounted
for the seats held by Sen. David Karnes, R-Neb.; Chic Hecht, R-Nev.;
and Lowell Weicker, R-Conn. Karnes appeared headed for defeat, while
Hecht and Weicker were battling down to the finish.
   But much of the action revolves around three of the six seats
being vacated by retiring senators, three Republicans and three
Democrats.
   There are clear favorites in Virginia, Mississippi and Vermont.
   Former Democratic Gov. Charles Robb is widely expected to capture
the seat being vacated by one-term Sen. Paul Trible, R-Va. Rep.
Trent Lott, R-Miss., the House Republican whip, is favored to take
the seat of the Senate's most senior Democrat, John Stennis, who is
retiring. And Rep. Jim Jeffords, R-Vt., is favored to win the seat
of retiring Sen. Robert Stafford, R-Vt.
   The three others _ in Florida, Washington and Wisconsin _ are
tossups, and may contain a key to the final outcome of the 1988
Senate campaign.
   In Wisconsin, millionaire businessman Herb Kohl, the Democrat,
has outspent Republican Susan Engeleiter, the minority leader of the
state Senate and held onto a shrinking lead despite criticism he has
never before held public office.
   In Florida, Republican Rep. Connie Mack III was locked in a tight
battle with Democrat Rep. Buddy MacKay for the seat being vacated by
Democrat Lawton Chiles.
   A dead heat for the seat being left by Sen. Daniel Evans,
R-Wash., has developed between former GOP Sen. Slade Gorton and Rep.
Mike Lowry, D-Wash.
   Lowry has run a series of negative ads, including one accusing
Gorton of voting ``against the environment'' in his previous Senate
term.
   The Gorton camp retaliated, recruiting Evans for a television
spot in which he accuses Lowry of distorting Gorton's record and
tells him: ``Mike, you've been spreading so much stuff I've had to
change my shoes.''
   The camera then pulls back, the picture widens and Evans, dressed
in a three-piece business suit, displays dirt-splattered work boots.
   Viewing the horseraces, Democratic and Republican strategists saw
it this way:
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Democratic
Campaign Committee: ``The Democrats will hold 54 seats at a minimum
and I believe have a very good chance to add. ... There is a unique
volatility in the electorate.''
   Tom Mason, spokesman for the Senate Republican Campaign
Committee: ``We are probably more enthusiastic about our chances now
than at any point in the cycle. We think the momentum is going our
way almost across the board. But we will have to win all the close
ones. ... But it's still quite volatile out there and we could still
end up on Election Day minus two. But we could just as easily be
plus two or better.''

<HEAD>Jamaica Will Neld Help Restoring Poultry Flock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jamaica's poultry flock was almost wiped out in
mid-September by Hurricane Gilbert, and the Agriculture Department
says the Caribbean nation will need additional aid to get it
reestablished.
   A report by the department's Economic Research Service says only
about 150,000 of Jamaica's normal flock of 5 million birds were
spared by the storm. Beef and dairy operations apparently were
damaged less severely, but heavy losses were reported for crops,
including sugar cane, bananas and tree products.
   Poultry accounts for nearly 60 percent of the meat consumption of
Jamaica's 2.5 million people. About 60 percent is produced
domestically, the rest from imports, mainly from the United States.
   Loans under various USDA credit programs have been stepped up to
help Jamaica buy food, breeding stock, hatching eggs and other items
needed to recover from the storm, the agency said.

   This year is the 30th anniversary of the first
sales of instant noodles in Japan, and a report from Tokyo says the
noodles have become a regular part of the Japanese diet and
lifestyle.
   Originally a snack food for children, the noodles _ known as
ramen _ now are consumed at the annual rate of 4.5 billion packets,
based on 1987 figures by the Japan Instant Food Industry Association.
   The report said that Japanese men, on the average, consume 3.7
packets a month; women, 2.8; and young people, 4.6. Overall, the
instant noodles make up an estimated 5 percent of Japanese food
expenditures.

<HEAD>French Voters Approve Plan For New Caledonia, But White Islanders
Vote No</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   French voters have approved a program to grant more
autonomy to New Caledonia and permit an independence referendum in
1998 on the South Pacific territory, but turnout was light and many
white islanders voted no.
   The government of Socialist Premier Michel Rocard is hoping the
statute, which passed Sunday, will buy 10 years of peace in the
islands that have suffered from intercommunal violence since 1984.
   The statute includes a development program for native Melanesians.
   With all votes in except from a few Caribbean territories, 80
percent of the vote was in favor of the new statute and 20 percent
against. Turnout, however, was a mere 37.3 percent, the worst
showing for any national election since the end of World War II.
   The archipelago of New Caledonia, 11,000 miles from Paris, has
been rent by periodic violence between the native Melanesians, known
as Kanaks, and white European settlers.
   Kanaks, most of whom favor independence, make up 43 percent of
New Caledonia's 145,000 inhabitants. The settlers, most of whom want
to remain French, are 37 percent. The rest of the population is made
up of Polynesians and Asians, who generally favor France.
   After another round of violence last spring that left 25 people
dead, Kanak leader Jean-Marie Tjibaou and Jacques Lafleur, leader of
the anti-independence forces, signed an agreement with Rocard on the
island's future.
   Tjibaou and Lafleur demanded a referendum to seal the deal.
   But Tjibaou, Lafleur and Rocard did not get strong national
backing for their plan. Only 14.5 million of France's 38 million
voters cast ballots. And of them, 13 percent cast blank or invalid
ballots.
   In New Caledonia itself, turnout was much higher at 63.7 percent,
but the approval much less. ``Yes'' received 57.03 percent and
``no'' 42.9. The opposition vote was largely in the south, where
most of the European population lives. In Noumea, the capital and
white settler heartland, 63.7 percent voted against the plan.
   ``Democracy has spoken,'' Rocard said after the polls closed.
``It appears that 12 million French have just approved the statute.
This statute is from now on the law of France.''
   The draft law voted on in the referendum proposes a new local
autonomy statute for New Caledonia, the seventh since the end of
World War II. It divides the archipelago into three provinces, each
with its own provincial assembly and local administration.
   The law also provides amnesty for any person charged with actions
of a political nature before Aug. 20, except murder.
   It also provides for a program of economic development in
Melanesian areas and training of local residents to assume
administrative tasks.
   Tjibaou admitted that the 42.9 percent ``no'' vote ``is very
large. It is a significant handicap for the future. We must be very
vigilant.''

<TEXT>
   A 125-pound Great Dane named Cinnamon has
Gov. Thomas H. Kean to thank for a reprieve of sorts that allowed it
to stay with its family.
   An insurance company had told William and Tina Slack they either
had to get rid of the dog or stop operating a day care center in
their home.
   Branchville-based Selective Insurance Co. of America told the
Slacks a large dog like Cinnamon might endanger young children, Mrs.
Slack said Sunday.
   ``Basically, their hands were tied,'' she said of the company.
``They didn't have much choice as far as the law is concerned.''
   She said no other insurance company would talk to them about a
day-care policy except Selective, and the family had to think of a
solution.
   The family needed the money from the day-care operation to help
pay the mortgage on their new house, Mrs. Slack said. Her husband is
a pastor.
   Faced with the thought of life without Cinnamon, their daughter,
11-year-old Kristy, wrote a letter to Kean and started what has
become known as the ``Cinnamon Affair.''
   A week later, the Slacks received a letter from the governor's
office, which said they could expect to hear about the case in a few
days, Mrs. Slack said.
   But Kristy grew impatient, called the office and was told that
her case had been sent to a higher state official.
   A few days later, Mrs. Slack said, the family received a personal
phone call from Kean, who told them a compromise had been worked out
and they could keep the 3-year-old dog.
   The family will have to keep her in a kennel in the backyard when
children are being cared for.
   Kean placed a few calls to state Insurance Commissioner Kenneth
Merin and Selective Insurance Co. executives, said Carl Golden, the
governor's press secretary.
   ``Here was a case that the governor felt was something that he
could involve himself in and hopefully bring it to a successful
conclusion, which he did,'' Golden said, who added that Kean is a
long-time dog lover.

<TEXT>
   The third-ranking leader of the
outlawed Communist Party of the Philippines was arrested at Manila's
airport on Sunday, authorities announced.
   Brig. Gen. Alexander Aguirre, capital regional commander, said
Ignacio Capegsan, allegedly the party's deputy secretary-general,
was planning to board a flight for Los Angeles.
   ``He was on his way to the USA, particularly Los Angeles,''
Aguirre said. ``It is possible that he is being projected into the
international commission of the Communist Party of the Philippines.''
   But a military official, quoting an intelligence report, said
Capegsan was at Ninoy Aquino International Airport to see off a
woman friend who was on her way to California.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
report did not say whether the woman was arrested. Aguirre said
Capegsan was carrying documents identifying him as a ``Mr. Beltran.''
   Military officials have claimed rebel representatives are raising
funds among Filipino expatriate communities abroad to finance the
19-year-old Communist insurgency. Aguirre said Capegsan was carrying
travel documents identifying him as a ``Mr. Beltran.''
   Aguirre said that following the arrest, troops raided a suspected
rebel ``safe house'' early Monday in suburban Quezon City and seized
bank books, computer diskettes and other records.
   Aguirre said he reported the arrest to President Corazon Aquino,
who has vowed to crush the rebel movement before her term expires in
1992.
   Capegsan was the highest-ranking member of the party to be
arrested since secretary-general Rafael Baylosis was captured in
March.
   He was believed to be a member of the party's ruling Political
Bureau and central committee. He was also chairman of the party's
Northern Luzon Commission, which directs rebel operations in the
northern Philippines.
   Capegsan was the seventh member of the central committee arrested
this year, according to the military. Longtime party leader Rudolfo
Salas was arrested in September 1986.
   Last month, a Philippine court issued an arrest warrant charging
that the founder of the party, Jose Marie Sison, had resumed its
leadership.
   Sison was jailed in the 1970s but released by Mrs. Aquino in
March 1986. He left the country the following September and remains
in Western Europe, where he issued a statement denying having
resumed party leadership.

   Starring in a new movie about rape brought back
nightmares for actress Kelly McGillis, who says she was raped,
sodomized and beaten in 1982 by two men who broke into her New York
apartment.
   Miss McGillis spoke about the ordeal in this week's People
magazine.
   Her new film, ``The Accused,'' is strongly reminiscent of a
gang-rape in a bar in New Bedford, Mass., where bystanders allegedly
watched and cheered. She plays the assistant district attorney who
prosecutes the bystanders.
   The 31-year-old actress says she turned down the role of the
victim, which went to Jodie Foster, ``because I have been a victim
in real life and had no need to re-create it on screen.''
   After filming ``The Accused'' and hearing two rape victims tell
their stories, she decided to go public with her own story.
   ``I thought that my not talking about my own experience was the
most cowardly act of my life,'' she said. ``I don't think I'm going
to change the world, but if I can make the difference in one
person's life, then telling my story has been worth it.''
   Two men were arrested. One served more than three years in
prison, charges against the other man were dismissed for lack of
evidence.

   Police have canceled a boycott of
Willie Nelson's concert Thursday after the country singer apologized
a second time for a benefit he performed for an Indian later
convicted of killing two FBI agents.
   Two weeks ago, Sgt. Harold Flammia, president of the San Antonio
Police Officers Association, asked officers not to work as security
officials at the concert because Nelson sang at a California benefit
for Leonard Peltier. Nelson met earlier this year with the American
Federation of Police Officers and the Fraternal Order of the Police
and issued a blanket apology for that concert.
   But Flammia said since the Texas police organization is not
affiliated with the other groups, it wanted a separate apology.
   Nelson gave one Friday night.
   ``I deeply regret that so many police officers and police
organizations were offended by the Indian concert,'' he said. ``I
have nothing but respect for all lawmen and under no circumstances
do I support cop killers.''

   ``He did great,'' Diana Ditka said Sunday after leaving his
bedside at Lake Forest Hospital, where the 49-year-old Ditka is
recovering from a mild heart attack suffered Wednesday.
   The Bears helped make the situation less stressful by beating the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 28-10.
   ``He didn't do anything different than if he were watching
another (team's) game,'' Mrs. Ditka said. ``If we were watching a
game after our game were over with, he would always yell, `Catch the
ball.' He just gets excited a few times when somebody makes a
mistake.''
   She said the only difference in watching the Bears game was that
he ``chewed his gum a little harder, I think.''

<TEXT>
   Sen. Dan Quayle is calling Democrat Michael
Dukakis ``the frightening candidate'' for president, saying Dukakis
has no foreign policy credentials.
   Answering questions Sunday as he entered the homestretch of the
1988 campaign, Quayle said he was offended by Dukakis' suggestion
that he would be unfit to head a White House crisis management team
in a Bush administration.
   The GOP vice presidential candidate said that Dukakis ``has
absolutely no experience in foreign policy. The only foreign policy
he's had is conversing with the governor of New Hampshire.''
   The Indiana senator struck back at Dukakis a day after the
Democratic standard-bearer said the notion of Quayle involved in
sensitive national security matters was ``a frightening thing.''
   Quayle scheduled a tour of a Westinghouse plant near Baltimore
today before flying to Roanoke, Va., for a rally and then to his
home state of Indiana.
   Quayle was rounding out his campaign with an appearance in South
Bend, Ind. He planned to dine privately with family and friends in
Indianapolis tonight, cast his ballot and return here Tuesday night
to await the election results.
   While carrying out a modest campaign schedule consisting of an
appearance at the historic Berkeley Plantation in southeastern
Virginia Sunday, Quayle was asked at several points if the Bush
campaign organization was intentionally giving him a low-profile
schedule in the campaign's waning days.
   ``I think you probably better unfog your glasses,'' he told a
bespectacled reporter who raised the question. ``I'm right here.
We're very versatile, very flexible. We go to good ones (solid
Republican states), bad ones (Democratic states) and in between.
Wherever they say.''
   The question was raised because Quayle in recent days has made
appearances in mostly small media markets and, with the exception of
Kentucky, Maryland and West Virginia, states considered safely in
the Republican column.
   Bush spokesman Mark Goodin, who accompanied Quayle on the
Virginia trip, said that sending the senator into traditionally
strong Republican states is part of a strategy, not to hide Quayle,
but to have the senator work to keep Republican backers from taking
Bush's election for granted.
   Quayle's ire was raised by statements that Dukakis made in
response to questions in an Associated Press interview. The governor
was asked about what he thought about Bush's suggestion, in an
interview with British television personality David Frost, that he
would put Quayle in charge of a crisis management team, if elected.
   ``Dan Quayle?'' Dukakis asked.``In charge of managing the most
serious crises we face in the country? That's a frightening thing,
isn't it.''
   Quayle, standing next to his plane before commencing his campaign
activities Sunday, snapped back. ``Well, the frightening thought is
President Michael Dukakis. He is truly the frightening candidate.
... He's the one that's truly frightening in the area of foreign
policy in any kind of crisis.''
   Asked what he would do if put in charge of a crisis management
team in a Bush administration, Quayle said only, ``Same thing George
Bush has done.''
   President Reagan gave Bush a similar assignment early in his
administration in a move that contributed to Alexander M. Haig Jr.'s
resignation as secretary of state. There has been little definitive
record of what Bush did in that capacity, although he has been
credited by some in the administration as having played a principal
role in overseeing the U.S. invasion of Grenada.
   Quayle said last week he thought he could be a valuable foreign
policy adviser to Bush because of his service on congressional
foreign affairs committees. Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, appearing with
Quayle at a campaign rally in Louisiana, credited the Indiana
senator with helping to get the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces
(INF) treaty ratified by the Senate.

<HEAD>Divorce Lawyers Give Thumbs Down To Arnie Becker of ``L.A. Law''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Divorce lawyer Arnie Becker may be a hotshot
attorney in the fictional legal world of television's ``L.A. Law,''
but his real-life peers say they wouldn't want to invite him to join
their group.
   After a panel discussion titled ``Arnie Becker _ How Real is
He?'' members of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers voted
50-14 against the notion of extending an invitation to Becker to
join their association.
   The hypothetical matter came up Saturday at the start of a
four-day meeting devoted mostly to weightier issues, such as custody
and surrogacy, and the economic hardships that no-fault divorce have
caused some women.
   But Leonard Loeb, president of the academy, credits Becker's
character with raising awareness of the legal specialty. However, he
said it's impossible to know whether the character actually has
influenced members of the profession.
   ``The character is bigger than life, but not unreal,'' said Loeb.
   ``And we're up closer than most people. We see the warts and
freckles, we understand many of the things he goes through. I
suppose the jury is still out, to what extent the portrayal has
helped.''
   Among those sitting in on the Becker panel was Bill Finkelstein,
an ``L.A. Law'' story editor and producer who writes Becker's
character, played by actor Corbin Bernsen, for the NBC-TV show.
   ``I'm not comfortable thinking about Arnie or any other character
strictly as a role model, because dramatically, that's too limiting
a standard to hold him to,'' said Finkelstein, an attorney who put
aside his practice while working on ``L.A. Law.''
   ``Like everybody else, Arnie has different sides, some heroic and
some anything but heroic. Arnie has done things that if someone I
knew in real life had, I'd say, `What a jerk!'
   ``By the same token,'' Finkelstein said, ``he's done some things
I greatly admire. And in this company, in dress, behavior and other
measures, I'd say he's basically middle of the pack. There are a
fair share of matrimonial lawyers more flamboyant than Arnie.''
   Needless to say, the vote probably won't affect Becker's
television following.
   Besides, fictional characters cannot join the elite academy,
which is comprised of only about 1,000 of the nation's 40,000
divorce lawyers. The American Bar Association's Family Law Section,
by contrast, has about 16,000 members.
   Despite the turndown, one thing Becker still has going for him is
the perception that ``L.A. Law'' has not only glamorized the
business, but has encouraged more young people to enroll in law
school.
   ``Enrollment is definitely up,'' said Finkelstein, ``but I don't
know whether that means I get the credit or the blame.''

   If kids could vote, George Bush and Michael
Dukakis would have a hard time matching 9-year-old Joseph Norfleet's
presidential platform: turn the White House into a toy factory.
   ``Instead of congressmen going to meetings, they would be busy
making my tops,'' Joseph wrote.
   Child's Play, a theater troupe, turned Joseph's and other
children's musings on what they would do as president into a stage
production at the Goodman Studio Theater on Saturday.
   And what would they do?
   Rig lotteries so their friends would get rich; hold school only
three times a week; hire an expert chef to prepare school lunches;
elect Chicago Bulls basketball star Michael Jordan mayor of Chicago;
and end federal ``spending on dumb things.''
   Shalita Boyle, a seventh-grader from suburban Crestwood, said if
she were chief executive for a day, said she'd go shopping and have
the taxpayers pick up the tab.
   Since none of them will be president in 1988, what would the
youngsters tell Bush and Dukakis if they met them?
   ``That's easy,'' said Joseph. ``I think they shouldn't make
promises they can't keep.''

<DATELINE>CAVE IN ROCK, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Not much traffic flows through this
sleepy town on the Ohio River, but a rock store on its main drag
boasts worldwide, mail-order sales that owners claim make it a gold
mine.
   ``We've got the best business in town, and people from around
here don't even know it,'' Larry Palmer, 23, said of Palmer's
Trading Post, which he and his father, John, operate in this
community of 468 people.
   ``Rocks are a good business. You'd be surprised.''
   John Palmer established the store about 18 years ago to get away
from the dangers of fluorite mining. Rocks always had fascinated
him, and he collected enough in his 16 years as a miner to go into
business.
   Finding a beautiful rock is like ``looking at a beautiful
woman,'' he said recently. ``You go, `Wow!' That's why people
collect rocks.''
   Most of the Trading Post's rocks come from the area. They carry
prices ranging from 50 cents to $4,000 and weigh up to 200 pounds.
The Palmers rely mostly on local miners to help the store maintain a
rock inventory in the thousands.
   ``What's so amazing about our little store here,'' Larry Palmer
said, ``is we can sit here all winter long and the only one who
comes here is the (mail carrier), and we're still making a living.
   ``I just bought me a new car,'' he said. ``I've got one of the
best jobs a guy in this country could have.''

   The football practice field at Columbiana
High School is choked with foot-high grass this fall because
financial problems have sidelined the football squad and other
extracurricular activities.
   ``We don't have a student newspaper, we don't have plans for a
yearbook, we don't have any sports. Right now we are not planning on
a prom,'' said Charles A. Winters, principal at the town's
350-student high school.
   The 1,200 students in Columbiana schools in northeastern Ohio
have lost extracurricular activities this school year because voters
have rejected six tax levies since 1986.
   A school tax increase is on Tuesday's ballot.
   Other school systems in Ohio have cut back sports because of
money woes, but the Ohio High School Athletic Association said
Columbiana is the state's only district without athletics this year.
   As a result, about eight athletes transferred to other school
systems, said Superintendent Roger Stiller. The latest departure was
by a basketball player last week, he said.
   Winters, who went to the University of Pittsburgh on a football
scholarship, said cutbacks in sports and other school programs could
hurt some students' chances to win scholarships and admission to
college.
   Senior Sheli Farran, who has played on the basketball, volleyball
and softball teams, said the loss of high school activities has left
Columbiana teen-agers without much to do in their spare time in this
rural village of 4,900 residents near Youngstown.
   ``It seems like you just come here, you go to school, and then
you go home and you have to find your own thing to do,'' she said.
``There's a movie theater, but you can only see the same movie so
many times ... really there's nothing for the kids in this town.''
   School districts on the East and West coasts generally have
avoided such cuts because of strong local economies, but in the
Midwest, where regions are suffering from stagnant economies, cuts
in sports, music and drama are more common, said John Myers, a
spokesman for the Denver-based National Conference of State
Legislatures.
   ``We have had the southern oil-producing and (midwestern)
agricultural areas show sharply declining property tax revenues,
which presents the schools with less money to spend on activities,''
he said.
   Myers said there are also efforts in some states to mandate a
limit on property taxes, thus reducing the amount of money available
to schools.
   Columbiana school officials first made the cuts in 1986.
   But a group of parents raised $92,000 to cover the cost of the
threatened activities through last school year, paying for coaches,
sports equipment and a choir director with the donations, Winters
said.
   ``The whole time they were saying, `This is a one time shot for
us, we can't do this again, so we need your support and we need this
levy passed,''' he said.
   Stiller said the average homeowner in the district pays $600 to
$650 in property taxes to the schools, which he said is about
average in the state.
   ``I guess what we have here is a real division in the community
between people who want those activities and people who either don't
care or don't want them,'' Winters said. ``Folks who don't have kids
or whose kids aren't involved don't really see that as a part of
education, I guess.''

   Partisans of 29 statewide propositions
Californians face Tuesday spent a record $130 million _ more than $9
a voter _ on a media war involving issues like car insurance rates,
AIDS and raising cigarette taxes.
   More than half the spending has centered on five conflicting
propositions aimed at revamping the auto insurance rate-setting
process and lowering premiums.
   Insurance companies alone, fearing a budding ``car premium
revolt,'' poured more than $60 million into the battle, and trial
lawyers' groups spent $15 million, making it the most expensive
single campaign in the country outside a presidential race.
   ``This is the most massive financial attempt in corporate history
to buy votes,'' said consumer advocate Ralph Nader, chief supporter
of the proposition that would cut auto rates the most.
   Other hotly contested initiatives would raise cigarette taxes by
a record 25 cents per pack, override Republican Gov. George
Deukmejian's veto of a state worker safety program, and tackle AIDS
issues.
   Elsewhere Tuesday: Maryland will decide whether to keep a
6-month-old law effectively banning cheap handguns; Michigan,
Arkansas and Colorado will tackle the issue of abortion financing;
South Dakota, Utah and Colorado will decide tax limitation proposals.
   Florida, Arizona and Colorado voters will vote on whether to
declare English their states' official language; and Oregon voters
will consider the toughest statewide smoking ban in the nation.
   Insurance companies have tried to convince California voters that
the only real hope for rate relief would come from Proposition 104,
which would create ``no-fault'' auto insurance and cap attorney fees.
   Insurers have condemned the rival Nader-backed Proposition 103,
which would cut rates 20 percent and impose government regulation.
They also have criticized a rival measure backed by lawyers to cut
auto premiums by 20 percent for good drivers and prohibit limiting
lawyers' fees.
   Despite the insurers' blitz of television commercials, polls
showed voters favoring the Nader-backed measure. But a large
undecided vote left the outcome unclear.
   If two or more of the measures pass, court battles may produce
some unintended hybrid.
   California Proposition 102, backed by tax revolt champion Paul
Gann, would require doctors to report people who have AIDS to county
public health offices. It would also allow people charged with
certain crimes to be tested for the deadly disease without their
consent. The measure has been opposed by state health authorities.
   Gann, who contracted acquired immune deficiency syndrome in 1982
from a blood transfusion, and other supporters argued that they were
tired of watching public health sacrificed in the name of civil
rights. Proponents received a boost late in the campaign when
Deukmejian endorsed the measure.
   A second AIDS measure would allow people charged with certain
crimes to be tested for AIDS without their consent. Supporters
claimed the measure would help protect victims of sex crimes, police
and firefighters. But critics argued it could give victims a false
sense of security.
   Polls indicated voters leaning toward adopting both AIDS measures.
   The tobacco industry spent $18 million to defeat a measure that
would raise cigarette taxes 25 cents per pack and use the money for
research and health care programs. But polls indicated the
initiative could pass by a slim margin.
   Health experts argued in their low-budget campaign that the
measure would discourage smoking; the industry called it an unfair
tax that would trigger a crime wave by encouraging cigarette
smuggling.
   California Proposition 97, meanwhile, would in effect override
Deukmejian's veto in 1987 when he wiped out the private-employer
portion of the California Occupational Safety and Health Act
program, known as Cal-OSHA.
   To supporters, including labor groups, the $7 million program
axed by the governor was the nation's finest worker safety system,
far more effective than its federal counterpart. To Deukmejian, it
was a wasteful state bureaucracy that duplicated federal efforts.
Polls indicated voters may pass the measure.
   The California ballot has been stretched even further by hundreds
of local measures across the state. San Francisco voters must wade
through 25 additional propositions, including two involving the
basing of the USS Missouri, the battleship on which the Japanese
surrendered during World War II. An advisory measure in Berkeley
supports Palestinian self-determination.
   The lengthy ballot prompted some counties to announce they would
apply a 10-minute limit on time spent in voting booths in order to
avert long lines. That prompted a challenge by civil rights groups,
who on Friday won a temporary restraining order from a federal
judge. But on Sunday the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overruled
the lower court and approved the 10-minute limit.

   A private jet owned by tobacco heiress
Doris Duke brought former Philippine first lady Imelda Marcos here
Sunday night.
   The Boeing 737 landed at San Jose International Airport about 8
p.m., said Griz Gotschall, the airport's operations supervisor.
   After the plane landed, Mrs. Marcos got into a private car and
drove away, Gotschall said. He said he didn't know when she would
leave or if she planned to head back to Hawaii.
   The plane left Morristown Airport in New Jersey on Sunday
afternoon. Mrs. Marcos had been staying with Miss Duke, who has a
1,200-acre estate at Hillsborough, N.J., after pleading innocent in
U.S. District Court in New York City to racketeering charges last
week.
   Miss Duke has an unlisted telephone number and could not be
reached for comment at her Hillsborough home.
   Mrs. Marcos and her husband, former Philippine President
Ferdinand Marcos, are accused of looting more than $100 million from
their homeland, funneling it to foreign bank accounts and using it
to buy prime New York City real estate and art.
   Marcos, 71, remained in Hawaii, where the couple has lived since
their ouster from the Philippines in 1986. His lawyers said he was
too ill to travel.
   Miss Duke and Mrs. Marcos are said to be old friends, and the New
Jersey millionaire posted more than $5 million bail for the former
first lady.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ One of Haiti's most powerful men, a
colonel indicted on U.S. drug charges who until recently led the
country's most feared army unit, has died under suspicious
circumstances, a family friend says.
   Col. Jean-Claude Paul, who was forcibly retired Sept. 30 as
commander of the Dessalines Battalion, died about 3 p.m. Sunday of a
heart attack in his home in suburban Fermathe, Radio Haiti-Inter
said. He was 49.
   The independent station gave no other details, but a family
friend said there was speculation the 29-year army veteran was
poisoned.
   Paul's maid and gardener were detained by police for questioning,
said the family friend, who would not be identified further.
   In addition, the colonel's former wife, Mireille Delinois, was
taken to the Petionville police station for protection because of
fear of reprisals by Paul's relatives, the friend said.
   The military government's spokesman, Frantz Lubin, said he had no
information on Paul's death. U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Susan Clude
also said she had nothing.
   Paul was stripped of his command after a Sept. 17 revolt by
noncommissioned officers ousted Haiti's military leader, Lt. Gen.
Henri Namphy.
   The coup leaders, who said they were outraged by state-sponsored
murder under Namphy, replaced him with Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril and
ousted about 60 of the army's most repressive commanders.
   Paul at first appeared allied with Avril, but the new leader
reportedly became concerned Paul might turn against him. Last month,
Avril said he planned to close the barracks of the 700-man
Dessalines Battalion, the most brutal unit in Haiti's 7,000-member
army.
   The unit has been linked to the Tonton Macoutes, the hated
private army of the 29-year Duvalier family dictatorship, and some
of its members have been blamed for widespread violence that has
thwarted moves toward democratization promised after a popular
uprising drove Jean-Claude Duvalier into exile in February 1986.
   The violence included attacks on polling stations that forced the
cancellation of independently run general elections last November,
leaving at least 34 people dead.
   Paul had been a powerful force in the army, which has run this
impoverished Caribbean nation for most of its 144 years. The
barracks of his former command are adjacent the presidential palace.
   In March, Paul was indicted by a federal grand jury in Miami on
charges of conspiring to import cocaine into the United States.
   The soldiers who ousted Namphy said they wanted to name him army
chief but decided not to because of the drug charges.
   Haitian and diplomatic sources later said Paul's retirement could
help lead to the renewal of a $70 million annual aid package the
United States cut off after the November 1987 election massacre.
   The drug trafficking indictment alleges Paul conspired to import
220 pounds of cocaine into the United States in December 1986. It
says the traffickers used a landing strip on Paul's farm 90 miles
outside Port-au-Prince, the capital, to load and fly the shipment to
the Bahamas.
   Fritz Pierre-Louis, a former lieutenant in the Haitian army who
later defected, told Sens. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., and Bob Graham,
D-Fla. in a special U.S. Senate hearing that 70 percent of Paul's
troops were involved in drug trafficking.
   Namphy led a military junta that assumed power when Jean-Claude
Duvalier fled into exile in France.
   An attempt to dismiss Paul in June failed and led to the fall of
the civilian government of Leslie F. Manigat, who had won
military-run presidential elections in January.
   Namphy had tried to reassign Paul to an administrative post, but
Paul refused and was backed by Manigat. Namphy ousted Manigat on
June 20, accusing him of meddling in army affairs, and Paul remained
head of his battalion.
   Paul did not intervene when soldiers overthrew Namphy in
September.
   The soldiers who formed Haiti's new government have said they
want to end random, state-sponsored violence and institute
democratic reforms, but the government has set no dates for
elections.

   Democrat Bruce Sundlun, hurling
allegations of unethical conduct, has battled to a dead heat against
Republican Gov. Edward DiPrete, and kept up the attack in an
eleventh-hour gubernatorial debate.
   Turning around a question on education Sunday, the millionaire
communications executive said: ``I think you ought to start
educating our children on the need for honesty and integrity in
state government. Ethics _ it's taught in the sixth grade.''
   Rhode Island is one of 12 states selecting governors Tuesday.
Democrats are given a good chance of retaking the office in Utah,
West Virginia and Indiana. Nine incumbents _ six Republicans and
three Democrats _ are on ballots.
   The gubernatorial race here is the most expensive in Rhode Island
history, with each candidate spending about $2 million. Sundlun, 68,
has contributed $1.9 million out of his own pocket.
   Sundlun, who lost to DiPrete by a landslide in 1986, robbed the
two-term governor of an early, commanding lead by raising questions
about DiPrete's private business deals, alleged favoritism in the
awarding of state contracts and the hiring last month of the ex-wife
of a reputed mobster for a state job.
   DiPrete, 54, has stressed the state's economic recovery in his
four years in office, citing increased spending on education and day
care and challenging Sundlun on Sunday to say what he would do
differently. He has also accused his opponent of business misconduct
and mismanagement.
   A WLNE-TV poll Friday and Saturday gave Sundlun 44 percent to 43
percent for DiPrete. A WPRI-TV poll Wednesday and Thursday gave
DiPrete 47 percent to Sundlun's 46 percent. Both surveys had margins
of error of roughly 5 points.
   ``We've seen all this negativeness and I think that adds a new
dimension to the undecided vote,'' said Brown University political
science professor Darrell West. ``They're not going to be able to
resolve their indecision because neither of the candidates has given
them a reason to vote for them.''
   Pollsters said undecided voters were relying on Sunday's hastily
arranged, televised debate to help them make up their minds, but
neither candidate took the experts' advice that Sundlun talk issues
and DiPrete confront the ethics questions.
   ``We're here today to talk about issues,'' said the governor,
accused by Sundlun of using his political influence in a family land
deal that netted him $400,000. ``I think the public is fed up with
your mudslinging, quite frankly.''
   Sundlun, who has attacked DiPrete for increasing spending 45
percent, appeared nonplussed and had to grope for an answer when
DiPrete asked him, ``What would you cut?'' The Democrat said he
would stop hiring outside lawyers for state business and reduce
spending by the governor's office.
   Elsewhere, West Virginia Gov. Arch Moore, a Republican, trailed
far behind Democrat Gaston Caperton; Democrat Evan Bayh, the son of
former U.S. Sen. Birch E. Bayh, led GOP Lt. Gov. John M. Mutz in
Indiana; and in Utah, Gov. Norm Bangerter erased a 30-point deficit
to draw even with Democrat Ted Wilson.
   Democrats hold 27 of the 50 governorships. Republican Robert Orr
of Indiana is barred by law from a third term; Montana Democrat Ted
Schwinden and New Hampshire Republican John Sununu are retiring.
Other states holding gubernatorial elections are Delaware, North
Carolina, Missouri, North Dakota, Vermont and Washington.

   A U.S. appeals court cleared the way for
California election officials to put a 10-minute limit on each
person's time in a voting booth, saying there was no evidence the
cap would be rigidly enforced.
   The 9th U.S. Court of Appeals ruled Sunday that a lower court's
temporary restraining order blocking at least three counties from
applying some measure of the 97-year-old law was unjustified.
   Appeals Judge Stephen Reinhardt of Los Angeles wrote that the
statute had not previously been enforced rigidly or in a way that
unduly restricted the ability to vote of people who do not speak
English as their primary language.
   ``The court has rightly recognized that this standard that has
been in use for nearly 100 years is an appropriate reminder to the
voter,'' said Chief Deputy Secretary of State Tony Miller.
   He added that ``no elections official is going to reject any
bodies from the booths,'' but many instead could now diplomatically
tell voters Tuesday to complete ballots as quickly as possible.
   The issue was raised when Marin, Sonoma and Santa Clara counties
announced they would use the law to speed people through voting
because of an unusually long ballot with 29 statewide propositions
and anticipation of a record turnout.
   Civil rights groups challenged the limit. On Friday, U.S.
District Judge Robert P. Aquilar ruled in San Jose that the time
limit amounted to a literacy test, which is outlawed by the federal
Voting Rights Act.
   The appeals court did not rule on that issue, saying it could be
decided in a trial.
   In arguing for the limit, Deputy State Attorney General Robert
Murphy said long lines could discourage voters from entering polls,
effectively disenfranchising them for the sake of those with
language difficulties who do not take advantage of absentee ballots.
   ``We're concerned that if people think there is no time limit,
people will tarry, will take all the time they can get,'' Miller had
said earlier.
   The lawsuit challenging the limit was brought on behalf of
Hispanic and Asian minorities by the Mexican American Legal Defense
Fund, the American Civil Liberties Union's northern California
chapter and the Legal Aid Society of Santa Clara.
   Manuel A. Romero of the legal defense fund argued Sunday that
requiring non-English speaking voters to transfer ballot choices
from a second-language sample ballot mandates ``a certain level'' of
literacy.
   But Murphy and James Emerson, Santa Clara's deputy county
counsel, said voting that way requires only basic mechanical skills.
   After the ruling, Romero said it indirectly validated his
concerns.
   ``It says what we've been saying, that in the absence of any
history of this being rigidly applied in the past, if business
continues as usual, with no strict, literal enforcement, then
there's no problems,'' he said.
   A record 10.5 million people are expected at the polls, or 75.2
percent of registered voters, according to Secretary of State March
Fong Eu.

   A 20-year-old man told a judge he
wants to serve time for car theft and forgery in prison because the
county jail is too boring.
   ``I can't sit that long in the county jail because it will drive
me crazy,'' Robert R. Couture said. ``There's nothing to do. If I go
to prison, I can go to school, I can get a job, go to work camp.''
   Couture asked Jefferson County Superior Court Judge William
Howard on Friday to delay his plea on three counts of forgery until
after Couture is sentenced in Snohomish County on a car theft charge.
   Jefferson County Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Steve Olsen said
Couture wanted to plead guilty to the car theft charge first so that
sentence will be added to his forgery sentence.
   Sentences over one year are served in state prisons, less than a
year in a county jail.
   Public defender Crad Verser told the court that the Snohomish
County prosecutor will recommend that Couture be sentenced to two
months in jail for the car theft. The standard range the court could
impose is two-to-five months.
   On the forgery charges, the most Couture could get is under 12
months, which would mean jail time.
   But with the sentences from both counties added together, Couture
could be sent to prison, for 12 to 14 months.
   Couture said he fears that if he had to languish in jail, he'd be
so restless he'd end up back in court on other charges before
completing his sentence.
   Howard accepted the two attorneys' recommendations and delayed
Couture's arraignment on the three forgery counts until January.

   Nan Berman has a suggestion for all spurned
lovers, tyrannized employees and anyone who's had an especially bad
day: don't get mad, get even. And she'd be glad to help.
   Her month-old business ``Enough is Enough,'' billed as ``creative
revenge for today's world,'' has already mailed a three-foot dead
bluefish to a philandering husband in California and delivered a
burned and messy suit to a lawyer who implied his girlfriend was
``unsuitable'' for him.
   More common requests among those wronged, however, are the 13
dead roses, sent in a beribboned black box ($25), or 13 black
balloons tied together by a single dead red rose ($30).
   Other ``insults to suit the occasion'' include a real stuffed
shirt ($25) for pompous bosses and drinking glasses with cigarette
butts on the bottom for obnoxious smokers.
   ``Twenty years ago, people didn't speak up the way they do now,''
said Berman. ``But since the '60s, people have expressed themselves.
And with me, you really have a way to vent things out.''
   Berman, 43, was inspired to start ``Enough is Enough'' after a
year spent driving a florist delivery truck for a boss she said was
the ``grumpiest, most unpleasant person ever born.''
   ``She never smiled, she was just miserable,'' said Berman. `` I
hung in there for a year but I was so sick of it. I thought _ I can
get this same atmosphere by making a business out of it.''
   Berman financed her venture with $30,000, some of it from her
husband, a businessman. She prowled bargain-basement department
stores and gift shows for ideas. She brought back artifacts such as
a cloth witch on a stick (for ``those witchy people on brooms''),
porcelain pigs (``for people on a diet'') and real kites (to send
those for whom you want to tell ``go fly a kite'').
   She buys her dead roses for $5 for several dozens at the Boston
Flower Exchange and purchases other items in bulk. Her material is a
combination of specialty store items from joke shops and objects she
finds herself.
   Berman is happiest fielding phone calls in her small office
behind a florist, surrounded by boxes of wilting roses, black
balloons, and buttons reading ``First of All _ We Kill All the
Lawyers.''
   She jumps up enthusiastically to point out another gag, like the
cactus she recently bought. She plans to deliver it to an
insufferable boor with the words ``sit on it,'' she said, laughing
uproariously.
   ``Maybe after a while it won't seem so funny but now I can't help
laughing all the time,'' she said.
   Since she opened her business, Berman has received more than 100
calls and 30 people have paid for her services. She promises her
customers that she won't reveal their names.
   ``I want to stress that we'll do anything, as long as it's
legal,'' she said.
   Berman is most eager to coordinate more elaborate schemes. For
people who want to play a prank on a boss, she has a plan in the
works to move the boss's office furniture and to another part of the
building.
   ``But we'll move it back during the day,'' she said. ``Most
people we get are doing this stuff for a joke. They're not
malicious.''
   Berman's part-time staff consists of her 23-year-old son, her
cousin and a friend. Her days driving a flower truck are a distant
memory.
   ``We just sit around and laugh all day,'' Berman said.

   Andrei Sakharov arrived on his first journey
outside the Soviet Union, declaring himself a free man and speaking
out for a supporter jailed over a protest on behalf of the Nobel
laureate nearly eight years ago.
   The human rights activist told reporters at Logan International
Airport on Sunday night that dissident mathematician Vazif Meilanov
was imprisoned after staging a one-man protest on his behalf and now
faces additional charges.
   ``I feel it is my duty now, at this moment, to remember this man
and many others who remain in prison,'' Sakharov said.
   Sakharov, winner of the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize for his defense of
human rights, is scheduled to spend two weeks in the United States
visiting relatives, undergoing medical tests and promoting a new
international organization.
   The trip comes less than two years after he was freed from
internal exile in the industrial city of Gorky, where he had been
sent because of his outspoken opposition to the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan.
   Using stepdaughter Tatiana Yankelevich as a translator, the tall,
balding 67-year-old spoke for about 10 minutes but refused to answer
questions. He appeared rumpled and tired after a 14-hour flight from
Moscow.
   ``Two years ago, I became a free man when I returned from Gorky
to Moscow,'' Sakharov said. ``Now I have become even freer because I
have been granted the right to travel around the world.
   ``But a man who staged a one-person demonstration on my behalf in
January 1980 when I was exiled to Gorky remains in prison. The name
of that man is Vazif Meilanov. He has been charged once again with a
very serious crime and faces a long imprisonment.''
   Meilanov was a cellmate of Natan Sharansky, who was deported in
1986 for his human rights work. Sharansky, who now lives in Israel,
said last May that Meilanov remained in Siberia.
   Sakharov is traveling without his wife, Yelena Bonner, who saw
him off with a kiss at Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow.
   He was starting his trip with a visit to her daughter by a
previous marriage, Mrs. Yankelevich, Mrs. Yankelevich's husband,
Efrem, and their two teen-age children in suburban Newton.
   Sakharov is expected to visit Mrs. Bonner's son, Alexei Semyonov,
Semyonov's wife, Liza Alekseyeva, and their 4-year-old daughter,
Alexandra, in the nearby town of Westwood. It will be his first
meeting with his granddaughter.
   He is also scheduled to undergo a heart examination and may
receive a pacemaker at Massachusetts General Hospital. Mrs. Bonner
had cardiac bypass surgery at the hospital in January 1986.
   Sakharov is expected to travel to New York, then Washington,
where he will participate in a board meeting Nov. 13-17 of the
International Foundation for the Survival and Development of
Humanity, the first such session outside the Soviet Union.
   The foundation, formed in January by Soviet and U.S. scientists
and educators, is embarking on a worldwide campaign to raise $10
million for research on global problems.
   Sakharov said Sunday he believed ``my country ... and your
country can do a great deal together for peace, for a world that is
happy and close and without hunger, violence or disease.''
   He said that since childhood, he has had a great deal of respect
for the United States, which is ``indeed a truly great country.''
   The granting of an exit visa for Sakharov to visit the United
States is a dramatic example of the changes in Soviet society since
Mikhail S. Gorbachev became general secretary of the Communist Party
in 1985.
   The foundation also played a role in obtaining the visa, said
Jerome Wiesner, president emeritus of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and the foundation's vice chairman.
   ``The foundation's position was not to meet outside the Soviet
Union unless all the board members could attend, and that meant the
Soviet government had to change its position and give (Sakharov)
permission to travel,'' Wiesner said at Logan airport.
   Sakharov was a top Soviet physicist and helped develop its
hydrogen bomb in the 1950s, but became a dissident leader in the
1970s. He was exiled to Gorky, a city about 250 miles from Moscow,
in January 1980, a month after the Soviets invaded Afghanistan. His
wife was banished to Gorky in August 1984.
   They remained there until Gorbachev called them back to Moscow in
December 1986. Earlier that year, Gorbachev had told a French
newspaper Sakharov could not travel outside the Soviet Union because
he knew too many state secrets.
   Sakharov has continued his scientific work, and now concentrates
on the origins of the universe. He speaks out occasionally on human
rights issues.

<HEAD>Hit-And-Run Driver Surrenders: `I Didn't Know What I Hit'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man has surrendered after more
than two years of keeping his identity a privileged secret and has
given an unapologetic confession to fatally running down a drunken
man on a dark beach road.
   ``I didn't know what I had hit,'' William D. Morser, a Delray
Beach restaurateur, said Sunday after he was charged with leaving
the scene of the March 9, 1986, accident in which Mark Baltes was
dragged 60 feet to his death.
   ``I realized I had run over something that was not a garbage bag
or not a bag of rags,'' Morser said. ``It all happened very quickly.
What could I do at that point?''
   Morser blamed Baltes for being in the road in the middle of the
night. Baltes, 28, had a blood alcohol level of 0.26 percent, more
than 2{ times Florida's legal intoxication level.
   ``If there is a jury that won't agree with that, then I'm living
in the wrong country,'' Morser said. ``I feel like I have been the
one taken advantage of, not the one lying on the ground.''
   The hit-and-run accident in posh Palm Beach gained national
attention because Morser's identity had remained a secret behind the
attorney-client privilege of confidentiality.
   The day after the accident, the driver contacted attorney Barry
Krischer and asked him to keep his identity secret and negotiate a
plea deal, which fell through.
   ``I was not about to walk into a police station and say, `Hey
fellas I'm raw meat, come and get me,''' Morser said Sunday.
   On Oct. 13, Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Timothy Poulton
upheld Krischer's right to keep the client's name secret.
   Meantime, Baltes' parents appealed on CBS-TV's ``60 Minutes'' for
information that might reveal the driver's identity and had offered
a $1 million reward contingent upon them winning a lawsuit from the
driver.
   Investigators first suspected Morser on Thursday after inspecting
his white Buick Riviera, which resembled the car that struck Baltes.
   Police also learned that Morser had recently moved out of a West
Palm Beach apartment that he had been renting from Kirscher since
before the accident, authorities said.
   When investigators interviewed Morser on Friday at his
restaurant, he appeared nervous and gave evasive answers,
authorities said. Morser was ordered to the appear Saturday at the
prosecutor's office, where authorities say he admitted he was the
driver who struck Baltes.
   Morser was booked Sunday on the felony and released without
having to post bond.
   ``His identity was discovered, it was confirmed he was my client
and I was called by the state attorney's office to produce my client
for a compelled statement,'' Kirscher said.
   A subpoena had been issued to compel Morser to talk about the
case, Kirscher said. Morser was given immunity in exchange for his
statement about Baltes' death, the attorney said.
   The immunity means prosecutors will not be able to use Morser's
statement against him in court and must find other evidence to prove
Morser was behind the wheel of the car that killed Baltes, Kirscher
said.
   Mildred Baltes and her ex-husband, Joseph, who had filed a $6
million lawsuit against the unknown killer of their son, said they
were relieved the mystery was over.
   ``It's been costly both financially and emotionally,'' said Mrs.
Baltes, who lives in Middletown, N.Y. She said she has spent $50,000
going back and forth to Florida leading the efforts to find out who
hit her son.
   Morser told reporters Sunday the family was in it only for the
money and he has been the real victim.
   Mrs. Baltes said that's absurd.
   ``He gambled and he lost and he is trying to make us out to be
the bad guys,'' she said. ``I happen to believe in justice for
everybody. My son is entitled to justice even though he is dead.''

<TEXT>
   Some federal safety officials who have
investigated two fatal airliner accidents are concerned that pilots
may not always be focusing on the business at hand in the critical
moments before takeoff.
   Federal investigators at the National Transportation Safety Board
are closely examining the tape covering nearly 30 minutes in the
cockpit of Delta Air Lines Flight 1141 last August before the Boeing
727 crashed seconds after takeoff, killing 14 of the 108 people
aboard.
   More than half of the tape, covering a lengthy taxi period at the
huge Dallas-Forth Worth International Airport, involves idle chatter
among the pilots and two flight attendants on subjects ranging from
the recent purchase of a house to birds nesting near airports.
   Nearly 11 minutes of the tape were omitted from the transcript
because they were considered irrelevant, including a reference,
according to sources, of news reports a few days before the crash of
chatter aboard a Continental Airlines that crashed in Denver 10
months earlier.
   If there is an accident, one participant in the Delta cockpit
reportedly reminded his colleagues, their words might end up in the
newspapers, too.
   Later, the Delta plane's captain told investigators he did not
care for the lengthy presence of the flight attendants in the
cockpit, but that it was not his nature to order them from the
cockpit during the long takeoff delay.
   Investigators emphasized that so far there has been no clear
evidence linking these conversations _ some of which was technically
legal because the plane was not moving _ with the possible cause of
the crash.
   But investigators are trying to determine whether the flight crew
forgot to properly set the jetliner's wing flaps, which help it gain
lift, and whether the conversations distracted them from preparing
the plane for flight.
   An exchange lasting 7 minutes and 42 seconds between co-pilot
Carey Kirkland and a senior flight attendant began as the crew was
going through one of the preflight check lists. Finally, the
exchange was cut short by Capt. Larry Davis, prompting an apology
from Kirkland about ``sittin' here talking to the flight
attendant,'' according to the transcript.
   Later flight engineer Steven Judd told investigators he had been
uneasy about the attendant's lengthy presence.
   While there is no link established between these discussions and
the accident, some NTSB investigators are uneasy about the casual
and relaxed demeanor the exchanges reflect.
   Furthermore, several aviation safety officials not involved with
the Delta investigation suggested such extraneous discussions before
takeoff are common.
   ``It's very difficult to legislate against people interacting in
a job situation,'' says Clay Foushee, an aviation safety researcher
at NASA's Ames Research Center in California.
   Foushee said while some casual exchanges may help a flight crew
feel at ease and work together, there also have been numerous pilot
complaints received through NASA's anonymous aviation reporting
system over the years about pilot distractions, including
inappropriate conversation and untimely presence in the cockpit of
flight attendants.
   Earlier this year, the NTSB in its final report on the Nov. 15,
l987, crash of the Continental Airlines jetliner in Denver also
raised concerns about idle chatter in the cockpit. That crash, which
killed 28 people, was attributed to the pilot taking off in snow
with ice on the wings.
   Four minutes before takeoff, the two Continental pilots ``engaged
in almost three minutes of nonpertinent social conversation'' _
reportedly involving a flight attendant _ which ``would suggest
inattention to more important details'' such as the weather and its
effects on icing, the safety board said.
   Since l981, the Federal Aviation Administration has had a
``sterile cockpit'' rule that prohibits any conversation among
flight crews not related to the operation of the aircraft when the
plane is taxiing and in motion, and when flying below 10,000 feet in
an approach or departure.
   Flight attendants also are specifically prohibited from entering
the cockpit during those periods.
   The requirement was prompted by concerns at the FAA about an
unusually high number of cases in the late l970s, including several
accidents, in which pilots were distracted from their duties by idle
chatter and other requirements such as making cabin announcements
during ``critical phases of flight.''
   FAA and other aviation officials concede they have no idea how
often the rule is ignored. Violations are uncovered only if an FAA
inspector is aboard _ at which times chatter is unlikely _ or after
an accident when the cockpit tape is reviewed.
   But federal officials note that even if a violation is shown and
the flight crew members survive an accident, there is likely to be
no FAA disciplinary action because the contents of the cockpit
recorder tape cannot be used either in court or as part of
administrative action by the FAA.
   Officials of unions representing pilots and flight attendants
acknowledged that at times the sterile cockpit rule may be violated,
but they said for the most part it is widely adhered to. Lengthy
delays before getting takeoff clearance adds to the problem, they
suggest.
   The long delays ``gives a very murky definition of when (the
cockpit) is sterile and when it is not,'' says Cindy Yeast, a
spokeswoman for the Association of Flight Attendants.
   Henry Duffy, president of the Air Line Pilots Association, calls
idle chatter in violation of the FAA rule ``the exception, rather
than the rule'' and suggested such conversation _ when not in
violation of the FAA rules _ may add to smooth aircraft operation.

<HEAD>Emperor Stabilizes After His Most Serious Blood Loss; Grandson
Returns</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Emperor Hirohito's vital signs stabilized today, one
day after his most serious loss of blood since falling ill seven
weeks ago with internal hemorrhaging, an imperial palace spokesman
said.
   The 87-year-old Hirohito, who has received almost daily blood
transfusions since he first coughed up blood Sept. 19, received 4.66
pints in emergency blood transfusions Sunday, spokesman Kenji Maeda
said.
   Also today Hirohito's second grandson, Prince Aya, arrived in
Tokyo after he was called back from Britain for the second time
since the emperor took ill. Aya, 22, is studying at Oxford
University.
   He returned to Japan at the end of September for nine days when
Hirohito's condition took a turn for the worse, and his latest
return was expected to fuel concern over the fate of the bedridden
emperor.
   The world's longest-reigning living monarch was ``in stable
condition for the time being,'' Maeda told reporters. But ``doctors
fear he may bleed again,'' he said.
   ``His temperature and other signs are stable,'' Maeda said, but
did not give the figures.
   Hirohito received the transfusions Sunday because of
``considerable'' amounts of blood lost during intensified
hemorrhaging, palace officials said.
   Kyodo News Service quoted palace sources as saying the emperor
discharged 56 ounces of blood Sunday.
   With the latest transfusions, the emperor has received a total of
40.16 pints of blood since September, more than three times the
blood circulating in his body.
   Doctors believe the emperor is bleeding in the upper intestinal
area, where he underwent a bypass operation in September last year.
   Hirohito's systolic blood pressure, which fell below the critical
level of 100 at one time Sunday, later recovered slightly but was
still well below the 150-point level of the past few days.
   The emperor's blood pressure was 116 over 56 this morning,
compared with 122 over 62 Sunday evening, Maeda said.
   Hirohito was ``awake and fully conscious'' in his room at the
Fukiage Palace, and had not discharged any blood today, the
spokesman said.
   Palace officials have refused to confirm or deny reports that
Hirohito has pancreatic cancer. ``We still don't know the exact
nature of the illness,'' said a senior palace spokesman, but ``the
illness is clearly progressing'' for the worse.
   Hirohito's son, Crown Prince Akihito, 54, has assumed imperial
duties that include placing an official seal on government documents
and meeting visiting dignitaries. Under Japan's constitution, the
emperor _ who was once worshiped as a god _ is a symbolic head of
state.

   Motorists paid slightly more for gasoline
during the past two weeks because dealers passed on short-term cost
increases, an analyst says.
   The average price of gasoline for all grades and types of
services, including taxes, rose .2 cent a gallon to $1.0023 a gallon
between Oct. 21 and Nov. 4, Trilby Lundberg said Sunday.
   It was the first increase since the end of the summer driving
season, she said.
   The Lundberg Survey of 12,000 gasoline stations nationwide found
the following average prices for self-service, which accounts for
most gasoline sales: Regular unleaded, 90.77 cents a gallon; premium
unleaded, $1.0606 and regular leaded, 87.28 cents.
   Full service prices were $1.1958 a gallon for regular unleaded,
$1.3013 for premium unleaded and $1.1666 for regular leaded.

<TEXT>
   A student suspected of unleashing a ``virus''
into an estimated 6,000 computers nationwide tried frantically to
warn operators after discovering his experiment had gone awry,
associates said.
   Robert T. Morris Jr., 23, a first-year student in Cornell
University's doctorate computer science program, is suspected of
creating the computer virus that last week clogged the computers
tied to a military network.
   He has been unavailable since discovery of the virus Thursday.
His father, Robert T. Morris Sr., a government computer-security
expert, said his son left the university Thursday to avoid reporters.
   The senior Morris has refused to say whether his son created the
virus.
   The electronic virus, so named because it multiplies after
invading a computer, jammed computers across the country linked to
the Pentagon-supported Arpanet network, slowing computers by
reproducing itself over and over. But affected centers reported the
virus only took up memory space and did not destroy any files.
   ``It could have been a whole lot worse,'' said Dexter Kozen, one
of Morris' instructors. ``He could have wreaked a lot more havoc. I
can't believe it was malicious. Mischievous, yes.''
   Friends of Morris quoted today in The Washington Post said Morris
created the virus as an intellectual challenge and that the virus
was supposed to lie dormant in computer systems.
   Morris reportedly went to dinner after setting the program loose
Wednesday night and checked it before going to bed. Discovering his
mistake, Morris desperately worked to find a way to stop the virus'
spread.
   ``His machines at Cornell were so badly clogged he couldn't get
the message out,'' said Mark Friedell, an assistant professor of
computer science at Harvard University, where Morris did his
undergraduate studies.
   Panicked, Morris called Andrew Sudduth, systems manager at
Harvard's Aiken Laboratory. He asked Sudduth to send urgent messages
to a computer billboard, explaining how to defeat the virus, Sudduth
told the Post.
   ``The nets (computer networks) were like molasses,'' Sudduth
said. ``It took me more than an hour to get anything out at all.''
   Cornell officials said Sunday they have no absolute proof that
Morris caused the virus. But the evidence in the university's
computer system so far points to Morris, they said.
   One Cornell official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Sunday that it appeared there was an early version of the virus in
Morris' computer files.
   The elder Morris, chief scientist at the National Computer
Security Center in Bethesda, Md., said the episode will ``clearly
raise the awareness of the existing vulnerabilities, particularly of
network systems.''
   The father has written widely on the security of the Unix
operating system, the target of his son's virus program, and is
widely known for writing a program to decipher passwords, which give
users access to computers.
   Morris said Sunday his son planned to meet with a lawyer today
and would not be available for comment until Tuesday or Wednesday.
``He's concerned, obviously,'' said the father, reached at his home
in Arnold, Md.
   The FBI, which is investigating whether any computer crime laws
were broken, have not yet spoken with his son, he said.
   The programmer who designed the network's electronic mail program
that the virus invaded said he had forgotten to close a secret
``back door'' to the program, The New York Times reported today.
   Eric Allman said he created the opening to make adjustments to
the program, but forgot to remove the entry point before the program
was widely distributed in 1985. He was working for a programming
organization at the University of California, Berkeley at the time.
   Paul Graham, a computer science graduate student at Harvard and a
friend of Morris, compared Morris' exploit to that of Mathias Rust,
the young West German who flew a light plane through Soviet air
defenses in May 1987 and landed in Moscow.
   ``It's as if Mathias Rust had not just flown into Red Square, but
built himself a stealth bomber by hand and then flown into Red
Square,'' Graham told the Times.

<HEAD>Man With Starter Pistol Arrested At Bush Rally</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man was arrested at a rally for presidential
candidate George Bush when he dropped a starter pistol, frightening
observers who shouted ``There's a gun! There's a gun!''
   John Arthur Junot, 40, of Los Angeles, was taken into custody
Sunday for violation of a federal law against impeding or disrupting
government business, said Secret Service spokesman Richard Adams.
   Junot was about 50 yards away from the vice president, who was
addressing a suburban Los Angeles crowd of about 10,000 on gun
control, said witness Hank Rodriguez, an ex-police officer.
   ``I will not take away your guns,'' Bush said in his speech.
There was no indication Republican presidential nominee even noticed
the incident.
   Junot fled as frightened bystanders yelled that he had a weapon.
Police arrested him moments later, authorities said.
   Junot could be fined $500 and sentenced to a six months in prison
if convicted, Adams said.
   Sgt. Jim Thompson of the Los Angeles Police Department said the
starter pistol was the type normally used at track and field events
and resembles a handgun, although it fires only blanks.
   Junot, who had been trying to get closer to the stage, reached
for his waistband when the pistol fell to the ground, said Rodriguez.
   Rodriguez said Junot ran when some spectators began yelling,
``There's a gun. There's a gun.''

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha
ended a dinner appearance in a shouting match with foreign
journalists, calling them ``thieves and enemies'' and saying blacks
don't want British-style democracy.
   The hostile question-and-answer session followed his speech at
the Saturday night banquet put on by the Foreign Correspondents
Association.
   ``I am sick and tired of a lot of foreign representatives
descending on my country and picking up on all the dirty work
instead of all the beauty, promise and good will,'' Botha said after
an argumentative exchange with one journalist.
   ``You don't understand Africa. You don't understand African
aspirations. You don't understand African history,'' he said.
   The 400 people attending included foreign and local journalists
and their guests, such as U.S. Ambassador Edward Perkins.
   ``Will you just sit down and listen to a man who has traveled
through Africa,'' Botha told a persistent questioner.
   ``Blacks don't want a Westminster-style democracy,'' he said.
``Even if you could remove all the whites from South Africa tomorrow
... what you put here will not work.''
   After a prolonged exchange with one woman, he said: ``I don't
want to quarrel with beautiful ladies. I do better things with
them.''
   He wondered out loud whether one questioner had ``psychological
problems.''
   Asked about the white minority government's suspension last week
of the anti-apartheid Weekly Mail newspaper, Botha said he supported
the move.
   He described the newspaper as one of the most ``vicious'' he has
seen in his travels around the world and said it contributed to
``more violence in this country.''
   At the end of the hourlong impromptu debate, the host offered to
thank Botha, but the foreign minister refused to accept. Instead he
returned from his seat to the podium and quoted a speech by Paul
Kruger, a 19th century South African politician.
   ``(Kruger's) opening words were, `friends, citizens, thieves and
enemies.' And that is how I look at you this evening,'' Botha said.
   The audience responded with boos, hisses and shouts of ``go
home!'' Botha left shortly afterward, before dessert was served.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
   South Africa's media restrictions have been further tightened
under the 29-month-old state of emergency. The emergency regulations
prohibit reporting on security force actions, most forms of protest
and a wide range of statements the government considers subversive.
Enforcement has not been comprehensive.

   Truck driver Cecil Roy Taylor Sr. twice entered
a burning and overturned car to save an 8-month-old girl trapped
inside. Now, Taylor says modestly, ``It was the natural thing to
do.''
   Taylor and 15 other Americans and Canadians were honored as
heroes Sunday by the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission. Two died in the
performance of their heroic deeds.
   The heroes or their survivors received $2,500 and a medal from
the commission, which was founded by industrialist Andrew Carnegie
in 1904 to honor heroic American and Canadian civilians. The
commission has honored 7,274 people.
   Taylor, 37, of Hamilton, N.C., was driving his car along North
Carolina 903 on March 24 when he saw a car ahead ``sliding down the
highway.''
   Trapped in the rear seat was little Gerrikka Taylor, who is not
related.
   ``The car was burning when it stopped,'' Taylor recalled. ``A
woman kept hollering that her baby was in the car. I climbed through
the car window and I saw the youngster. Something blew up and I had
to get out.
   ``I got my hunting knife and went back in the car. I cut the
girl's seat loose and I handed her out. I had to break the front
seat to get out myself.''
   Taylor said he is not a hero.
   ``Everybody tries to tell me I'm a hero, but it just seemed like
something a human being should do,'' he said. ``It was the natural
thing to do.''
   Others honored by the commission are:
   _ Michael N. Knieriem, 46, of Thousand Oaks, Calif., who rescued
a 6-year-old girl and a 4-year-old boy from their burning
condominium in Newbury Park, Calif., on Oct. 2, 1987. Knieriem
suffered severe smoke inhalation.
   _ Bobby D. Ratliff, 44, and Kenneth G. Harlow, 45, both of Llano,
Texas, who rescued a woman, her 12-year-old boy and her 4-year-old
boy from their burning car after a June 12, 1987, traffic accident.
Harlow suffered minor burns.
   _ Christopher Bordeaux, 24, of Chicago, who died trying to save a
28-year-old woman who had fallen in the path of a speeding train at
Lake Forest, Ill., on Jan. 11. The woman also died.
   _ Philip Contreras, 26, of Huntington Beach, Calif., who saved a
59-year-old man from his burning car after a traffic accident in
Compton, Calif., on Aug. 27, 1987.
   _ Martin Lopez, 21, of Cuero, Texas, who saved a 10-year-old boy
from a burning apartment on Aug. 5, 1987.
   _ Grant P. Clemens, 32, of Oxnard, Calif., and Kenneth R.
Vandergrift, 40, of Santa Paula, Calif., who saved a 59-year-old man
from his burning car after a traffic accident in Saticoy, Calif., on
Dec. 9, 1987. Both men suffered burns.
   _ Steven Allen Grimm, 17, of Mishawaka, Ind., who saved a
10-year-old girl from her burning mobile home on Dec. 26, 1987.
Grimm suffered burns.
   _ Tommy James Russell, 18, of San Diego, who saved a 36-year-old
man from his burning car after a traffic accident in National City,
Calif., on July 24, 1987.
   _ Timothy J. Costello, 16, of Chula Vista, Calif., who saved a
12-year-old boy from drowning in the Pacific Ocean at Coronado,
Calif., on June 19, 1987.
   _ Adam Michael Calderon, 17, of Lake Elsinore, Calif., who saved
a 59-year-old woman from an attacking Doberman pinscher on Feb. 2.
Calderon suffered bites.
   _ Orville L. Parde, 46, of Adams, Neb., who saved a 32-year-old
man from a burning car after a traffic accident at Panama, Neb., on
Feb. 12.
   _ Troy D. Leach, 16, of Pilton, Ill., who drowned trying to save
a 14-year-old boy from drowning in the North Fork of the Vermilion
River at Danville, Ill., on June 2, 1987. The other boy survived.
   _ Walter Moyseuik, 67, of Etobicoke, Ontario, who rescued a

<HEAD>Afghan Rebels Say They Running Low On Arms While Soviets Send In
More Weapons</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Moslem guerrillas surrounding this
southern city say they are running low on weaponry while Moscow
supples new warplanes and missiles to the Marxist government to
repel the guerrillas' advances.
   One guerrilla leader says some fighters have acquired
satellite-guided U.S. mortars but supplies are limited and some of
the weapons were destroyed by Soviet bombings.
   Soviet-Afghan forces defending Kandahar, the country's
second-largest city 300 miles southwest of the capital Kabul, bombed
the area in the past week with newly introduced Soviet MiG-27 jets,
the guerrillas said.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass reported the Afghan army
killed more than 300 guerrillas near Kandahar and other areas from
Friday through Sunday.
   State-run Radio Kabul, monitored in London, reported that
guerrilla attacks killed 33 people in the same period, including 30
it said died when a missile hit a bus near Kandahar.
   The Soviets said last week that they have suspended their troop
withdrawal from Afghanistan and have sent advanced weapons to their
southern neighbor because of unrelenting pressure from the
anti-communist guerrillas known as the mujahedeen, or Islamic holy
warriors.
   Among weaponry newly introduced in Kabul are SS-1 Scud missiles,
which are capable of reaching Pakistan, 120 miles away.
    U.S.-supplied anti-aircraft Stinger missiles that once sent
Soviet fighter jets fleeing to higher altitudes are in short supply
and jealously hoarded, said guerrillas in the Kandahar area.
   ``The air is the only trouble for mujahedeen,'' not military
installations on the ground, said Abdul Wali, a guerrilla commander
in the area.
   Kandahar sits in the middle of an arid plain that offers little
protection from marauding aircraft that have leveled the city's
southern suburb of Mahalajat.
   The MiG-27s, first supplied by Moscow around Oct. 23, drop their
bombs without decoy flares, used before a raid to fool heat-seeking
missiles.
   ``They must know they have nothing to fear anymore,'' said a
Western diplomat in Islamabad, Pakistan, who spoke on condition he
not be identified.
   Gul Lalai, a guerrilla commander, said he examined
satellite-guided mortars at a base south of Kandahar and run by the
hard-line Hezb-e-Islami guerrilla group.
   Non-guerrilla sources in Pakistan have also confirmed the
four-barrel, 120mm weapons were supplied to the insurgents.
   Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, who heads the Hezb-e-Islami, has denied
receiving any foreign aid and the United States has refused to
publicly acknowledge the weapons' existence in Afghanistan.
   Guerrillas who used their limited technological expertise to
describe the mortar, said a satellite acts as a spotter, sending
coordinates to the launcher, which is equipped with a screen and a
small receiver.
   Mujahedeen fighters fire two rockets in the direction of the
target, and the satellite does the mathematical equation that locks
it in. There was no word on the mortar's range.
   However, the insurgents say supplies are limited and two of the
mortars were destroyed when the MiG-27s blasted rebel positions east
of Kandahar airport late last month.
   In the latest fighting, guerrillas reported heavy bombing around
Kandahar during the past week that killed at least nine people and
injured 80.
   Tass reported that guerrillas on Sunday fired three rockets into
Kabul but did not say if there were any casualties.
   It said that over the weekend the Afghan army killed 153
guerrillas in fighting around Kandahar and in the settlements of
Tur-Kotal and Sarpuza. It said troops attacked an ``armed gang'' in
Zabol province, killing 150 guerrillas and wounding 52 people,
including a Pakistani adviser.
   Under terms of the U.N.-mediated Geneva accords reached in April,
the Soviets agreed to withdraw the estimated 100,000 troops it sent
into Afghanistan since 1979 to help the Moscow-backed Kabul
government fight off the guerrillas. About half the troops have been
pulled out.
   But on Friday, Moscow said it halted the second half of the
pullout that was to be completed by Feb. 15.

   The Soviet Union celebrated its 71st anniversary
today with a traditional display of military might on Red Square,
and the top U.S. diplomat attended for the first time since the
Soviets intervened in Afghanistan.
   The parade commemorating the Bolshevik Revolution took on less of
a political character than in past years of higher international
tension. Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov criticized Western defense
policies in a short and comparatively mild speech, and banners
displayed on the square had an almost exclusively domestic, economic
character.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov
walked onto Lenin's Mausoleum and acknowledged the applause of the
crowd alone at the center of the reviewing stand. In contrast to
previous years, the other members of the Communist Party's ruling
Politburo followed far behind them.
   Moscow party leader Lev N. Zaikov stood on Gorbachev's right
throughout the parade, a possible indication that he has moved up in
the party leadership.
   Yegor K. Ligachev, a conservative who formerly was regarded as
the No. 2 Kremlin leader, stood next to Ryzhkov, an indication he
has fallen in the hierarchy.
   All 11 Moscow-based members of the Politburo attended the
gathering marking the anniversary of the seizure of power by the
Bolsheviks in 1917. The annual event is often one of the clearest
indicators of changes in the hierarchy.
   Some of the Soviet Union's most sophisticated military
technology, including SS-21 surface-to-surface missiles, T-72 tanks,
anti-aircraft weapons, armored personnel carriers and rocket
launchers followed. Western diplomats said there were no new weapons.
   Thousands of soldiers, diplomats and spectators jammed Moscow's
main square under blustery, leaden skies. A light snow fell, the
temperature was just below freezing and Red Square was adorned with
a giant red-and-white portrait of Lenin and political slogans.
   John M. Joyce, the U.S. charge d'affaires, was at the parade,
said Embassy spokesman Richard Gilbert.
   It was the first time the top U.S. diplomat in Moscow attended
the Revolution Day parade since the Soviets sent soldiers to
Afghanistan in December 1979. Gilbert said U.S. Ambassador Jack F.
Matlock was out of town and would have attended had he been in
Moscow.
   Ambassadors of other NATO countries also attended the parade.
Their return reflected the agreement signed in Geneva April 14 under
which half of the 100,000 Soviet soldiers have been withdrawn from
Afghanistan and the remainder are to leave by Feb. 15.
   However, fighting continues in Afghanistan and the Soviet Union
on Friday said it was suspending its withdrawal because of
continuing attacks by Moslem rebels.
   Yazov reviewed the soldiers and sailors on Red Square and
delivered a relatively mild message criticizing Western military
policies.
   ``The destruction of medium and shorter-range nuclear weapons has
just begun, yet already there are calls for all kinds of
compensation, modernization, the build-up of conventional arms and
the stepping up of the `Star Wars' program,'' he said.
   Following the speech, divisions of the Soviet Union's top
soldiers began the traditional parade through Red Square, past
Lenin's Mausoleum.
   Thousands of people began gathering in the early morning cold
hours earlier. Music was piped into streets that had been closed to
traffic and marchers gathered on main thoroughfares carrying pink
and yellow balloons toward Red Square.
   They followed the soldiers and military vehicles onto the square
with slogans such as ``War on Bureaucracy,'' and others supporting
Gorbachev's drive for economic reform.

   On a desolate, nightmarish landscape strewn with
rubbish and guarded by the barren, gnarled skeleton of an old tree,
sits a shabby, soiled man.
   He is joined by an equally dirty and desperate companion who
attempts to make some sense out of their existence in this
inhospitable environment.
   We are in the uncertain, often bleak, often funny world of Samuel
Beckett, and the two men _ Vladimir and Estragon _ are ``Waiting for
Godot,'' a mysterious person who never does arrive.
   It's the only thing you can be sure of in Beckett's enigmatic
masterpiece which opened Sunday in an all-star revival at Lincoln
Center's Mitzi Newhouse Theater.
   ``Star'' is the operative word in this production and the reason
the revival is sold out for the rest of its run which ends Nov. 27.
It's no accident that each of the play's two acts starts with a drum
roll and clash of cymbals.
   This ``Waiting for Godot'' has two of the country's biggest comic
talents _ Steve Martin and Robin Williams _ playing Beckett's
memorable tramps. They are joined by Academy Award-winning actor F.
Murray Abraham and clown Bill Irwin as the archetypal master and
servant Pozzo and Lucky. Lukas Haas is the young messenger from the
unseen Godot.
   What the austere Beckett would make of them is anybody's guess,
but the playwright's love of classic comedians is well known. After
all, Bert Lahr starred in the original Broadway production of
``Godot'' in 1956, and Beckett once wrote a film script for Buster
Keaton.
   This revival, directed in high style and plenty of show biz glitz
by Mike Nichols, certainly has its quota of giggles, yocks and even
belly laughs. At the production's last preview, theatergoers sounded
as if they were lapping up Neil Simon's latest laughfest rather than
Beckett's metaphysical musings.
   Many in the audience came for the stars, not the play, and they
weren't disappointed.
   The scruffy Williams, sporting a beard and shaggy hair, is a
brilliant improviser and has a strong stage presence. His Estragon
is a maniacal creature, verging out of control at times, but he can
get a laugh out of the simplest of stage business, such as pulling
off a boot or trying to eat a raw carrot.
   But he veers into some stage antics and line twistings that
Beckett never would have dreamed of _ giving hilarious imitations of
such diverse cultural icons as R2D2 and John Wayne, complete with an
improvised machine gun. Nichols should supply the stage manager with
a net when things start to get too wild.
   The gray-bearded Martin has a tougher assignment playing the
subdued, almost straight man Vladimir to Williams' more flamboyant
Estragon. He doesn't quite succeed. Martin is a bit bland, fading at
times into Tony Walton's mesmerizing setting of white sand. His
voice is colorless, too, rarely rising above a monotone. Martin
seems almost complacent and without that desperation needed to
convey the author's sense of futility about life.
   The unnerving expression of that futility is left to Abraham and
Irwin in the secondary roles of Pozzo and Lucky. Abraham gives a
bizarre, idiosyncratic performance _ with an odd Mafioso accent _ as
the severe taskmaster. Still, he manages to spit out with the proper
bitterness Beckett's lament about life.
   ``They give birth astride of a grave, the light gleams an
instant, then it's night once more,'' he says. It's a jolting note,
considering all the laughs going on around him.
   The usually boyish Irwin, looking like an old man in superb
makeup by J. Roy Helland, is sensational as the abused servant
Lucky. The actor is an accomplished mime as well as a comedian.
Every gesture has been carefully thought out, not only for the
comedy, but for the pain that lies underneath the laughs.
   ``Godot'' straddles both comedy and drama as Beckett tries to
grapple with fundamental questions of human existence. At times, the
play teeters on despair while making the audience laugh out loud.
But Nichols' production pretty much gives up on the drama. And maybe
it doesn't matter. With this cast, ``Godot'' can be enjoyed at its
most superficial and comic level, even though it rarely digs below
the surface.
   In the published text of the play, ``Waiting for Godot'' is
described as ``a tragicomedy in two acts.'' The Lincoln Center
revival concentrates on the laughs _ and gets them. But by doing so,
it loses the haunting loneliness and tragedy that also permeate the
play.
   In other reviews, Howard Kissel of the Daily News wrote: ``The
virtue of Nichols' approach is that, unlike many productions where
Beckett's austerity and somberness are heightened by actors' desire
to make the work confusing and thus more profound, this `Godot' is
direct, accessible and entertaining. ... Even if the play rarely
achieves pathos, its ending is haunting because of Jennifer Tipton's
masterful lighting.''
   Clive Barnes wrote in the New York Post: ``Nichols is quite
wonderful in timing the production, in collaborating with his actors
to hit every precise button as they come up ... This is an
immaculate production that is a shade too self-conscious for its own
perfection, but one which, in its care and precision, has been, like
Godot, worth waiting for.''
   Frank Rich wrote in The New York Times: ``The naked realism of
`Godot,' which belongs to no specific place or time but to all
places and all time, does not suit a director whose gift is for
comedy strongly rooted in contemporary social detail. Rather than
expanding his artistic reach to meet Beckett's, (Nichols) contracts
the play to fit his own chilly esthetic. ... Audiences will still be
waiting for a transcendent `Godot' long after the clowns at Lincoln
Center, like so many others passing through Beckett's eternal
universe before them, have come and gone.''

<HEAD>Military Says It Captures Third-Ranking Communist Rebel</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The third-ranking Communist rebel
leader was captured at Manila airport, where he may have been
planning to board a flight for Los Angeles under an assumed name,
officials announced today.
   President Corazon Aquino said Sunday's capture of Ignacio
Capegsan, whom the military described as deputy secretary-general of
the Communist Party of the Philippines, shows that her government is
winning its struggle against the 19-year Marxist insurgency.
   Brig. Gen. Alexander Aguirre, capital regional commander, said
Capegsan was captured Sunday in the parking lot of Ninoy Aquino
International Airport.
   Capegsan's wife, Cresteta, was arrested today during a raid on
the couple's suburban Quezon City home in which police seized
weapons, a personal computer and bank books for accounts totalling
$75,000, officials said.
   ``He was on his way to the USA, particularly Los Angeles,''
Aguirre told reporters. ``It is possible that he is being projected
into the international commission of the Communist Party of the
Philippines.''
   Later, Capegsan, 42, told reporters at a police station that he
had gone to the airport to see off his father-in-law, Lorenzo
Mercado, who was on his way to California. Capegsan denied he
planned to leave the country.
   Capt. Florenio Angeles, who made the arrest, said Capegsan
dropped off his wife and father-in-law at the departure terminal and
then drove his car to a nearby parking lot, where he was taken into
custody.
   Angeles said police were simply speculating that Capegsan
intended to fly to California too because there was no other
explanation for parking the car. Access to the terminal is limited
to ticketed passengers.
   He said informants had told police Capegsan planned to travel to
the United States last month, but canceled the trip.
   Military officials have claimed rebel representatives are raising
funds among Filipino expatriate communities abroad to finance the
insurgency.
   Angeles said, however, that police found no ticket on Capegsan
and that Philippine Airlines had confirmed reservations only for the
wife and father-in-law. He said Capegsan may have planned to fly
stand-by.
   Angeles said police made no attempt to track down the wife and
father-in-law inside the terminal. But Mrs. Capegsan returned home
without boarding the flight and was arrested the following day.
   During a brief appearance before reporters, Capegsan claimed he
left the rebel movement in late 1986, after nearly 16 years in the
underground, because of fatigue and philosophical differences with
other rebel leaders.
   Foreign reporters, however, saw him with rebels in December 1986
during a nationwide 60-day cease-fire.
   According to the military, Capegsan is the highest-ranking member
of the party to be arrested since secretary-general Rafael Baylosis
was captured in March. Authorities say Capegsan served as chairman
of the party's Northern Luzon Commission, which directs rebel
operations in the northern Philippines.
   Capegsan told reporters he had been deputy chairman before
leaving the underground.
   Mrs. Aquino, who has vowed to crush the rebel movement before her
term expires in 1992, hailed the arrest. She told a meeting of
Southeast Asian businessmen today that the capture was ``a very
important development.''
   Capegsan was the seventh suspected central committee member
arrested this year. Longtime party leader Rudolfo Salas was captured
outside a Manila hospital in September 1986.

   A storm system lingered over the northern tip of lower Michigan
this morning after dumping snow along the Lake Superior shoreline,
causing minor accidents in Michigan and Wisconsin, while rain and
gusty winds struck farther west.
   Several people were injured in three accidents involving 14
vehicles in Michigan, but state police said no one was seriously
hurt.
   Marquette, Mich., got 10 inches of snow by 7 p.m. Sunday, said
forecaster Birdie Nash of the National Weather Service office in Ann

   Snow was scattered in northeast Ohio and western Pennsylvania.
About an inch fell in several Ohio cities, and western Pennsylvania
had similar accumulations.
   Showers were scattered across western and central New York state,

central sections of the Dakotas into northeast Colorado.
   Winds gusted to 35 mph at times around Denver Sunday evening.
   Winds also gusted across Montana and Wyoming, with speeds ranging
from 25 to 40 mph.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers from northern New
England to New York state; snow in western Pennsylvania and the
central Appalachians; rain and snow from eastern parts of the
Dakotas to the upper Mississippi Valley and the northern Great
Lakes; rain in the Pacific Northwest; and winds from the northern
Rockies to the northern and central Plains.
   High temperatures were expected in the 40s from eastern
Washington state to the northern Rockies, the Dakotas, the upper
Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes region to the central
Appalachians; 70s in Florida and the lower Mississippi Valley, and
in California's interior valleys; 80s in much of Texas, the southern
Rockies and the desert Southwest; lower 90s near the Rio Grande
Valley; and 50s or 60s in the rest of the nation.
   The nation's temperatures at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 17 degrees at
Duluth, Minn., to 76 at the Naval Air Station near Key West, Fla.

   Former Philippine first lady Imelda
Marcos stopped in California to spend the night with her daughter
before continuing home today to Hawaii, authorities said.
   Mrs. Marcos, wife of former Philippine President Ferdinand
Marcos, arrived at San Jose International Airport on Sunday night
aboard a jet belonging to tobacco heiress Doris Duke.
   Mrs. Marcos had been staying with Miss Duke in New Jersey since
pleading innocent to racketeering charges in U.S. District Court in
New York last week.
   Miss Duke, said to be an old friend of Mrs. Marcos, posted the
former first lady's $5 million bail.
   Mrs. Marcos was spending Sunday night at the home of her
daughter, Irene Araneta, who lives in a suburb of San Francisco, and
was to leave for Honolulu sometime this morning, said Ralph Girardi,
the No. 2 agent in the FBI's Honolulu office.
   Mrs. Marcos left New Jersey's Morristown Airport in Miss Duke's
Boeing 737 Sunday afternoon, according to the Federal Aviation
Administration in New York. The jet landed at a private aviation
company at the San Jose airport around 8 p.m., said Griz Gotschall,
the airport's operations supervisor.
   The jet was the same one that late last month took Mrs. Marcos to
New York from Hawaii, where she and her husband have lived since
their ouster from the Philippines in 1986. She also stopped in San
Jose on that trip.
   Both Marcoses are accused of racketeering. Ferdinand Marcos, 71,
remained in Hawaii after his attorneys told a federal judge Marcos
was too ill to make the trip.
   The Marcoses are accused of plundering $103 million from the
Philippine treasury, funneling it to foreign bank accounts and using
it to buy prime New York City real estate and art.

   Cardinal John O'Connor honored Jews and the holy
laws of the Torah in a Mass marking the 50th anniversary of
Kristallnacht, the night of shatttered glass that ushered in the
Nazi Holocaust.
   The Roman Catholic cardinal said more than human decency demands
the world remember the Nazi atrocities.
   ``Otherwise we will be destroyed by the indifference that permits
betrayers and killers to stalk the face of the Earth,'' O'Connor
said during a Mass on Sunday at St. Patrick's Cathedral.
   O'Connor has asked all 410 churches in the Archdiocese of New
York to ring their bells Wednesday and parishioners to light candles
on the anniversary. He said he would light a memorial candle in the
window of his residence that night.
   On Nov. 9-10, 1938, Nazis rampaged against Jews in major cities
as well as those in small towns in Germany and Austria.
   ``Let us remind ourselves of the depth of gratitude that we owe
to our Jewish brothers and sisters who died, who lived, but
ultimately survived, survived because they preserved the law,''
O'Connor said, holding the Torah, or first five books of the Hebrew
Bible, given him by Jewish leaders soon after his arrival in New
York City in 1984.
   The attack became known as Kristallnacht, or Crystal Night,
because of the shards of broken glass that littered the streets. It
is considered the beginning of the German drive to exterminate Jews.
An estimated 6 million Jews and hundreds of thousands of others died
at the hands of the Nazis.
   O'Connor made the remarks during his annual Mass for Catholic
lawyers and judges. He reminded the legal community of its duty to
preserve the law.
   ``Is it any wonder that the first lawyers ... were awed by their
tasks, that they were mandated to preserve the law, to copy the law,
to teach the law, to interpret the law, above all to love the law,''
he said. ``Without the law the heart is ripped out of Judaism, the
heart is ripped out of the world.''
   Among those at Sunday's Mass were former Gov. Hugh Carey, Vincent
McConnell of the Guild of Catholic Lawyers, Rabbi Marc Tanenbaum of
the American Jewish Committee and Dr. Yaffa Eliach of the Center for
Holocaust Studies.

<HEAD>Actress Says She'd Like To Play Ordinary Housewife</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Meryl Streep, know for adopting
foreign accents for her film roles, says she would like to play
someone who lives a bit closer to home _ a Connecticut housewife
with three kids.
   In her new film ``A Cry In The Dark,'' Streep adds an Australian
accent to her repertoire. ``I get a lot of flak for my accents,''
she said.
   The actress said it's more exasperating than hurtful to handle
critiques of her accents, such as the Polish lilt of the
concentration camp survivor from ``Sophie's Choice,'' or the
sing-song tones she used playing a Danish baroness in ``Out of
Africa.''
   In a Los Angeles Times interview published Sunday, she said she
would like to portray someone like herself _ a Connecticut housewife
with three kids who organizes the neighbors to fight for favorite
causes.
   ``I really would love to play a housewife with environmental
concerns, but they don't make movies about them,'' Miss Streep said.
``I don't go looking for parts with accents, but I'm drawn to what
hits me in the solar plexus. I need to engage on that level, to do
roles that have something to say.''
   The actress said her next project is to tranform herself into the
title character of ``Evita,'' the musical about Argentine dictator
Juan Peron's charismatic wife, Eva Peron.
   She said the part has been offered to her, but filming won't
start until October 1989. That will give her time for singing
lessons to prepare.
   Another avenue Miss Streep would like to pursue is comedy.
   ``I just haven't gotten many comedies,'' she said. ``I'm a sucker
for the powerful story. I could do the easy thing and not have to go
and kill myself each time. I don't know why I do, but it's the way I
am.''

<TEXT>
   Elane Sollins' last wish was to have her ashes
scattered where her favorite baseball player could be found _ on
third base at Baltimore's Memorial Stadium.
   Sollins was an avid fan of the Baltimore Orioles, especially
former third baseman Brooks Robinson. She went to about 20 games a
year, where her favorite seat was along the third-base line, and she
listened to the rest of the games on the radio or television.
   Since Sollins died Oct. 25 at 63, her son has been pursuing her
wish.
   ``She's been saying that for 20-30 years ... whenever Brooks
Robinson started playing,'' said her son Charles Kalus. ``She was a
big Orioles fan for years, and third base is where her darling
Brooksie played. I know it's an odd request, I know it's nutty, but
odder requests have been made.''
   Robinson said he didn't know Sollins.
   ``I've heard a lot of them, but this is a new one,'' he said.
``I'm flattered. I didn't realize how involved fans got with players
until I got out of the game.''
   John Aymold, who works for the Loring-Byers funeral home, wrote
to the city's director of parks and recreation for approval. If he
goes along, the decision rests with the team.
   ``If there's any way to honor it, we're going to try,'' Kalus
said. ``Before she died, she went straight to the Orioles with her
request and was turned down. I understand that. But I just told her
I would take it from there.''
   Larry Lucchino, acting president of the Orioles, said he was
staggered by the request, but said the team would be willing to talk
to the city and family about it.
   If the request is denied, Kalus said he might take matters into
his own hands.
   ``I'll show up at the stadium and talk to them myself,'' he said.
``I might even call Brooks to see if he has any pull ... and there's
always Camera Day, when fans are allowed on the field.''

<TEXT>
   A 24-year-old American, convicted on
cocaine trafficking charges by a Spanish court despite attempts by
former U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese to have him freed, left
today for the United States.
   Conan Owen, 24, of Annandale, Va., was sentenced to six years in
prison in April after being convicted of bringing four pounds of
cocaine into Spain from Chile in a false-bottomed suitcase.
   But once in the United States, Justice Department officials could
decide to grant Owen immediate parole because they believe he is
innocent.
   Owen has consistently denied any knowledge of the cocaine in the
suitcase, a claim corroborated in a court deposition by a Washington
D.C. man for whom Owen was working as a freelance photographer at
the time of his arrest.
   To obtain the transfer to the United States, Owen had to agree
not to appeal his conviction. He returns home under a 1983 treaty
signed by Madrid and Washington that permits convicts to serve out
their sentences in prisons in their home country.
   The Spanish government agreed to his request for a transfer
during a weekly Cabinet meeting Oct. 28.
   Accompanied by two U.S. marshals, Owen boarded TWA flight 903,
which left Barcelona for New York with a stopover in Madrid. He left
prison Sunday in a police van and spent the night at Barcelona
police headquarters.
   Owen, who worked as a 1984 summer intern in Vice President Bush's
office and had been admitted to the U.S. Army Intelligence School at
Fort Huachuca, Ariz., was arrested March 13, 1987, on his arrival in
Barcelona from Santiago, Chile.
   In Chile, Owen said he had been shooting travel brochure photos
on an assignment arranged by Washington D.C. resident Jorge Barahona.
   In return for a suspended sentence on a felony cocaine charge and
a promise from U.S. officials that he would not be extradited to
Spain, Barahona told a U.S. federal judge that Owen knew nothing
about the drugs and had been set up to carry the suitcase.
   His declarations also led to the indictment in Virginia of three
others in the plot. All three are at large.
   But the Barcelona court that tried Owen refused to admit
Barahona's deposition as evidence because plea-bargaining is illegal
in Spain.
   When Meese traveled to Madrid in February to sign a protocol for
an extradition treaty with then-Justice Minister Fernando Ledesma,
he told reporters he was handing over Barahona's deposition to
Ledesma in hopes the charges against Owen would be dropped.
   After Owen's conviction, Meese said through a Justice Department
spokesman that he ``regrets very much this action by the Spanish
court. ... I think it's important to stress that we continue to
believe ... in Mr. Owen's innocence, and we continue to hope that he
will ultimately be exonerated.''

<HEAD>Army Crushes Prison Uprising; 12 Inmates Killed</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with troops storming prison, 12

   Troops backed by helicopters and
armored cars stormed a prison and killed 12 inmates today in
crushing a rebellion by 1,500 convicts, authorities said.
   About 25 prisoners were injured in the assault by troops who
threw tear gas and opened fire as two helicopters hovered over the
medium-security Welikade Prison in suburban Colombo, police said.
   Soldiers stood guard and smoke could still be seen more than two
hours after the uprising was quashed at the prison, which generally
houses inmates awaiting trial on criminal, rather than political or
civil charges.
   Among the injured was a former navy sailor convicted of attempted
murder for clubbing Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India with a
rifle butt two years ago, police said.
   Half the prison population of 3,000 broke out of their cells
Sunday and staged a sit-in to demand better food, the resignation of
President Junius R. Jayewardene and the dissolution of Parliament,
officials said.
   The inmates took one guard hostage but released him early today,
police said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   They then set fire to furniture in four buildings behind the
20-foot walls around the prison complex and cut telephone lines, the
police said.
   Officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the prison
rebellion apparently was inspired by strikes and demonstrations
being organized around the country by a radical Sinhalese group, the
People's Liberation Front.
   The front has accused Jayewardene, a Sinhalese, of making too
many concessions to minority Tamils seeking autonomy.
   In southern Sri Lanka, at least 153 prisoners tunneled out of a
military detention camp Sunday, but 78 of them were recaptured, the
government.
   Almost all the escapees from the Pelawatte camp had been detained
on suspicion of belonging to the People's Liberation Front, blamed
by authorities for more than 500 killings in the past 15 months. The
camp is 30 miles southeast of Colombo.
   The front opposes the government's peace overtures for ending a
five-year-old Tamil guerrilla war. Tamils, who make up about 18
percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people, want an independent
homeland in the northeastern Sri Lanka. They claim they are
discriminated against by Sinhalese, who comprise 75 percent of the
people.
   In another prison protest Sunday, about 800 inmates in Kandy, 60
miles east of Colombo, staged a clamorous demonstration from their
cells. About 35 of them sat on the roof of Bogambara Prison, waving
red flags and demanding Jayewardene's resignation.
   The president has already said he plans to retire after new
presidential elections scheduled for Dec. 19.
   The injured inmates at Welikade Prison included Wijemuni Vijitha
Rohana, who attacked Gandhi on July 30, 1987, one day after Gandhi
and Jayewardene signed a peace accord designed to end a guerrilla
war by Sri Lanka's Tamil minority.
   Rohana, a 23-year-old Sinhalese, was listed in serious condition,
police said.
   Rohana was a member of a military honor guard that Gandhi was
inspecting when the sailor swung his rifle and landed a glancing
blow on the prime minister's shoulder. In November 1987, a military
court convicted Rohana of attempted murder and sentenced him to six
years in prison. Rohana has appealed.

<HEAD>Israeli Coalition Agreement May Divide Jews In Israel, Abroad</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONI RABIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Right-wing Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir may pay
a high price for forming Israel's next government if he drives a
wedge between the Jewish state and the international Jewish
community in the process.
   Shamir's Likud bloc is using a package of religious laws, opposed
by many Jews outside Israel, as a bargaining chip to coax the
religious parties into a Likud-led coalition.
   Jewish organizations overseas particularly fear passage of laws
that enhance the power of Israel's Orthodox Jews, thus devaluing the
Conservative and Reform streams of Judaism to which many Jews abroad
belong.
   ``This is a red line,'' said Harry Wall, head of the Israeli
office of the U.S.-based Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith.
``This could do serious damage to the concept of Jewish unity and
common destiny, and weaken the ability of American Jews to identify
with Israel.''
   Likud won 40 parliament seats in Tuesday's elections, more than
the 39 seats won by the left-leaning Labor Party but not enough to
form a government without the support of four small religious
parties, which together hold 18 seats.
   Passing religious legislation could undermine the American Jewish
community's political and moral support for Israel and threaten the
half-billion dollars Israel gets in annual contributions from
American Jewry.
   One of the ripple effects could be to diminish the power of the
pro-Israeli lobby in the United States, which has a tremendous
influence over U.S. foreign policy. The United States gives Israel
$3 billion in aid each year.
   At the heart of the controversy is the so-called ``Who is a Jew''
law _ the law that defines who is Jewish and thus eligible for
automatic Israeli citizenship.
   At present, the law says a Jew is anyone whose mother is Jewish
or who converted to the faith.
   But Orthodox Jews say this is not enough. They want to amend the
law so that only conversions performed by an Orthodox rabbi will
count.
   Only 10 to 15 percent of the United States' 5.5 million Jews are
Orthodox. For the others _ although the number of converts among
them may be small and the number who plan to live in Israel marginal
_ a change in the law would cast doubt on their Jewishness.
   ``The American Jewish community is going to support Israel
regardless of Israeli policy on almost any issue,'' said Shlomo
Avineri, a political scientist at the Hebrew University in
Jerusalem. ``There is only one reservation, and that is the
Who-is-a-Jew legislation.''
   Jewish groups in the United States and worldwide are mobilizing
their forces to fight the amendment.
   Representatives of organizations and private individuals have
flooded Israeli consulates and embassies with telegrams and phone
calls opposing the change, said Rabbi Richard Hirsch, executive
director of the World Union for Progressive (Reform) Judaism.
   ``It's been a spontaneous reaction,'' he said. ``Who-is-a-Jew has
become a symbol of what the relationship is between the state of
Israel and the Jewish nation.''
   The North American Coalition on the Who's A Jew Question, an
umbrella group formed last year before a previous attempt to change
the law failed, voted unanimously Friday to fight the amendment,
said Stephen Donshik, director of the Israeli office of the Council
of Jewish Federations.
   He said the coalition communicated its concern to Israeli
political parties even before last week's elections, and will repeat
its message through telegrams, letters and possibly newspaper
advertisements.
   ``The state of Israel is a mutual identification point for Jews
all around the world,'' Donshik said. ``This should not be a
political issue.''

<HEAD>Titan Missile Launched, Probably Carries Military Satellites</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Titan 34D rocket
thundered into space with a secret cargo during the weekend, and one
expert said it probably carried a pair of military communication
satellites into orbit.
   The 16-story-tall booster blasted off Sunday morning, said Air
Force Capt. John Sullivan, a spokesman for the sprawling Vandenberg
military base on the coast 140 miles northwest of Los Angeles.
   As usual for military space flights, the Air Force didn't
announce the launch in advance and declined to identify its payload.
   However, it most likely carried two Satellite Data System
satellites, although it also might have carried either a KH-9 or
KH-11 photo reconnaissance satellite, said John Pike, a space policy
expert for the Washington-based Federation of American Scientists.
   Pike, who knew about the launch in advance, said Friday the data
system satellites are used for military communications.
   The satellites provide ``a way for the president to stay in touch
with our nuclear forces ... to give bombers and (silo-based crews
operating) missiles the `go code''' to launch nuclear warheads, he
said.
   Pike said two SDS satellites were ``launched five years ago.
They're due for replacement.''
   SDS and KH-series satellites are the only types launched from
Vandenberg on Titan 34Ds, he said.
   ``The reason I think it's SDS is I don't think the Air Force has
any more KH-9s or KH-11s,'' Pike said.
   The Titan 34D, America's most powerful space booster, will be
supplanted by the Titan 4, due for its maiden launch next year from
Cape Canaveral, Fla.
   The last launch of a Titan 34D was from Cape Canaveral on Sept.
2, but sources told The Associated Press it failed to place its
payload in orbit.
   Pike described that payload as a satellite designed to monitor
Soviet missile tests and radio, telephone, radar and other
electronic communications.
   Two Titan 34Ds were launched successfully in late 1987. Before
then, they were grounded following two straight explosions during
launches on Aug. 28, 1985, and April 18, 1986, destroying a KH-11
and a KH-9.

<HEAD>Palestinian Kills Soldier Guarding Jewish Settlement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Palestinian day laborer today stabbed to death
a soldier guarding a Jewish settlement in the West Bank, and then
the assailant was killed by an Israeli farmer, witnesses said.
   The soldier was killed at about 9 a.m. while guarding the gate to
the Massua cooperative farm, 26 miles northeast of Jerusalem, said
Yuval Yedidia, head of the cooperative.
   The Arab worker approached the gate on foot, Yedidia said. When
the guard demanded an entry permit, the assailant ``attacked the
guard with a knife and stabbed him about 30 times,'' Yedidia said.
   One of the farm's residents ``heard shouts, he grabbed a gun, and
they (the soldier and the assailant) were still entangled when he
arrived. He opened fire,'' Yedidia said.
   The Palestinian was among about 100 seasonal laborers working in
grapevines, pepperfields and flowerbeds, residents said.
   The cooperative was closed off by soldiers after the attack, and
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, army chief
of staff, came to the farm.
   Yedidia described relations between Arabs and Jews in the
cooperative as ``generally good,'' but said members had expressed
concern about Palestinians working in their midst. He said farmers
or soldiers routinely guard the cooperative.
   Today's deaths brought the Palestinian death toll to 308 since
the Dec. 8 start of the uprising against Israeli occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip. The guard became the 11th Israeli and
second soldier to be killed.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, four Palestinians were wounded
today when troops opened fire to disperse a demonstration protesting
the army's closure of West Bank schools, Arab hospital officials
said.
   Some demonstrators carried outlawed Palestinian flags and others
chanted ``Open our schools immediately!'' and ``Freedom for our
students!''
   West Bank schools have been closed for most of the uprising. Army
officials argue that schools are hotbets of anti-Israeli violence.
   A fifth Palestinian, a 14-year-old boy, was wounded in a clash
with troops in Gaza City, hospital officials said.
   Also today, the right-wing Likud bloc and the left-of-center
Labor Party held talks with smaller parties for a chance to form the
next coalition govermment after Tuesday's inconclusive elections.
   Attacks on Israelis generally boost hard-line sentiments, and an
West Bank firebomb attack Oct. 30 is believed to have cost Labor a
crucial three seats in the 120-member Parliament.
   A mother and her four young sons were burned to death in the
assault on a bus north of Jericho.
   Likud, the largest party, seemed to have the best chance of
putting together a rightist coalition with the support of four
Orthodox parties.
   Likud won 40 seats in the 120-member Parliament and Labor won 39,
but the left wing parties together have 49 seats to the right's 47.
   Labor's chances improved Sunday after two ultra-Orthodox groups _
Shas and the Torah Flag Party _ announced they were considering
joining a Labor-led government.
   Another prospect of Labor participation was a joint government
with Likud like the one formed after 1984 elections ended in
stalemate. Labor Party leader Shimon Peres is under some pressure to
join with Likud and avoid concessions that would curtail the freedom
of Israel's secular majority.
   The Hadashot newspaper said over the weekend that Likud leader
and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir would be willing to discuss such a
coalition on condition he remain prime minister, with Rabin, a
Laborite, staying on as defense minister.
   Rabin, who has had a long-running feud with Peres and is a rival
for the Labor leadership post, told Israel television Saturday he
didn't rule out a joint government with Likud.

   Not all elections are created equal, and come
Tuesday night, with returns flooding in from 50 presidential races,
468 congressional, 12 governorships and umpteenhundred propositions
and referenda, a precious few will be worth a lingering look.
   Some examples for national office:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PRESIDENTIAL</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   IOWA: It was here last winter that George Bush took a humbling at
the hands of Pat Robertson and Bob Dole. When he lost a Republican
straw poll, he mused that his supporters might have been attending
air shows or debutante parties. Michael Dukakis is flying in for a
pre-dawn rally in Des Moines on Election Day to nail down a victory;
nonetheless, Iowa is a Republican state and you'd have to see it to
believe it would go to the Democrat.
   TEXAS: Lloyd Bentsen was supposed to give Dukakis a foot in the
door of this pivotal state, but Texans can vote Bentsen (for Senate)
and still vote for the other home-state candidate, Houston
hotel-suite occupant Bush. Without Texas, Dukakis realistically
needs to sweep California, Michigan, Ohio and Illinois or he goes
home to be governor. A pretty tall order. Michigan and Ohio both
voted Democratic exactly once since 1936.
   OHIO: Is there somewhere in Ohio a street corner that a prominent
Republican hasn't visited? They call it carpet-bombing: GOP leaders
from Ronald Reagan on down have come in to erect a ``firewall'' in
Ohio in case Dukakis wins Texas.
   MARYLAND: A gun-control measure may increase conservative turnout
and deliver this Democratic state to Bush. In which case look for
the GOP to put a gun issue on every ballot in every state every year
forever.
   SOUTH DAKOTA: A Republican loyalist from Castlewood was saying
recently she thought this might be a Democratic year. It would be
the first one since Landslide Lyndon won almost everything in 1964.
   ILLINOIS: For Dukakis to win in Illinois, he needs a big turnout
and a big margin from Chicago black voters. But some pundits believe
disinterest in this key constituency may play to Bush's advantage,
here and elsewhere.
   (California may have the best presidential race in the nation,
but the state is so big and the ballot is so complicated that any
reasonable person has lost interest.)
</TEXT>
<HEAD>U.S. SENATE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON: Arm-waving Rep. Michael Lowry is one Democrat who's
willing to be known as a liberal. He's in a tight race with Slade
Gorton, who got tossed out of the Senate by voters in 1986.
   CONNECTICUT: Liberal Republican Lowell Weicker is under pressure
from Democratic Attorney General Joseph Lieberman _ and the
conservative Buckley family. Weicker went negative in a
late-campaign ad effort to save his seat.
   FLORIDA: Democrats had practically given up on this seat until
Rep. Buddy MacKay emerged from a long and messy primary campaign to
mount a serious challenge to Rep. Connie Mack III.
   NEVADA: Chic Hecht, widely thought of as one of the more
inarticulate members of the Senate, was widely counted out against
Gov. Richard Bryan. Win or lose, Hecht has impressed everyone by
turning the race into a tossup.
   MISSISSIPPI: This state was once reliably Democratic, but the
retirement of John Stennis gives Republicans (in House GOP Whip
Trent Lott) their best chance of a pickup. Still, Rep. Wayne Dowdy
has a reputation for finishing better than his polls.
   WISCONSIN: Wealthy Democrat Herbert Kohl against Susan
Engeleiter, a Republican legislator who won an endorsement from the
Milwaukee Journal which said it would be a good thing if there were
more women serving in the Senate.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>U.S. HOUSE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   GEORGIA 4th: If Ben Jones, D-Dukes of Hazzard, defeats Rep. Pat
Swindall, it will bring the number of TV characters in the House to
two (Fred Grandy, R-Love Boat), the same number of women in the
Senate.
   CALIFORNIA 19th: A completely different Gary Hart, this one also
a new age Democrat, is trying to unseat Rep. Robert Lagomarsino in
the nation's most expensive House race. For $1.2 million, the winner
will represent President Reagan in his upcoming retirement.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>GOVERNOR</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WEST VIRGINIA: Sometimes Gov. Arch Moore wins (he's finishing a
third term), and sometimes he loses (once to John D. Rockefeller IV,
despite the best bumper sticker exhortation ever: ``Make Him Spend
It All, Arch!'). Moore is the underdog against another Roman numeral
Democrat: Gaston Caperton III.
   INDIANA: You figure this out. In a year with Hoosier Dan Quayle
on the Republican ticket, a Democrat named Bayh (Birch's boy Evan)
is favored to win the governorship. To block him, Quayle and Bush
both came in to campaign for John Mutz.
   UTAH: You don't want to raise taxes in Utah if you can help it.
Gov. Norman Bangerter, a Republican in a state even more Republican
than Indiana, is struggling in a three-way race in which the
favorite, former Salt Lake Mayor Ted Wilson, is a card-carrying
Democrat.

   One player matched all six numbers to win a $38
million Lotto jackpot, but the identity of the lucky ticket-holder
remains a mystery, lottery officials say.
   The player, who won the grand prize after a week of
record-breaking ticket sales, will receive the state's second
largest jackpot in annual payments over the next 20 years, said
Sharon Sharp, director of the Illinois lottery.
   In the hour before the 7 p.m. drawing Saturday, the state's 4,100
machines processed a record 26,000 tickets per minute and sales
topped $1.1 million an hour, said lottery spokeswoman Kathy Rem.
   Ticket sales totaled $26.7 million for the week, including $11.5
million on Saturday alone, Ms. Sharp said Sunday.
   Lottery officials were expected to announce the total prize _ at
least $38 million _ today, Ms. Rem said. But she said it was
unlikely the winnings would top the $40 million prize won in 1984 by
Chicago printer Mike Wittkowski.
   The prize grew as no one matched all the Lotto numbers for three
consecutive weeks.
   To win, players must match the six numbers between one and 54.
Lesser prizes go to players who match four and five of the six
winning numbers. The winning numbers were 33, 35, 43, 44, 45, and 52.

<TEXT>
   All but one of the forest
fires that plagued Yellowstone National Park this summer have been
declared under control, thanks to early snowfall.
   Fire managers will watch the smoldering leftovers of the fires
until the last puff of smoke dies away, said park spokeswoman Amy
Vanderbilt.
   Only the Clover-Mist blaze, whic burned in Yellowstone and the
adjacent Shoshone National Forest, has yet to be declared
controlled, Vanderbilt said Sunday.
   Wintry weather late last week helped get the North Fork, Wolf
Lake and Snake complex of fires under control, she added.
   The snow also forced park officials Sunday to close Yellowstone's
south and east entrances, probably until spring. The west and north
entrances remain open.
   Officials have estimated that about 20 percent of the 1.1 million
acres the fires surrounded were charred in the 2.2 million-acre park.
   Snow depths in the park Sunday ranged from an inch or less to as
much as a foot.
   Active firefighting ended some weeks ago, but officials have
continued to keep a close eye on the fires.
   As of Saturday there were still 41 people and one helicopter
monitoring and doing rehabilitation work on the North Fork fire in
the area of the Old Faithful geyser, while 173 people and three
helicopters monitor the adjacent Wolf Lake fire, according to
Vanderbilt. Four people were monitoring the Snake complex in the
park's southern section.
   ``That's primarily rehabilitation crews, and some of that work is
ongoing as long as weather permits,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Strong earthquakes jolted the Vanuatu
and Fiji islands in the South Pacific today, seismologists reported.
   There were no reports of casualties or damage from the quakes,
each of which measured 6.9 on the Richter scale, according to the
Seismological Observatory in Canberra and the U.S. Geological Survey
in Golden, Colo.
   The epicenter of the Fiji quake was in the sea about 250 miles
south of the islands, said an official at the Canberra observatory.
He gave no time for the quake.
   An earthquake struck Vanuatu, about 700 miles west of Fiji, at
3:50 p.m. local time today, according to seismologists in Golden who
registered the movement. Vanuatu is 1,100 miles north of Auckland,
New Zealand.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake
as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Every
increase of one point represents a tenfold increase in intensity. A
reading of 6 on the Richter scale can cause severe damage in a
populated area.

<HEAD>Operation California Sends 30 Tons Of Supplies To Nicaragua</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty tons of medical and other emergency
supplies have been flown to hurricane-ravaged Nicaragua after an
airport send-off by actors Robert Blake, Kris Kristofferson and
others.
   The $750,000 worth of medicine, medical equipment, water
purification and storage equipment and shelter material were donated
by pharmaceutical companies and other corporations, said organizer
Richard Walden.
   Nicaragua and other Latin American nations were battered last
month by Hurricane Joan, which devastated the Nicaraguan city of
Bluefields.
   Debrah Farentino of the ``Hooperman'' TV series, Valerie Wildman,
who starred in the movie ``Salvador,'' and movie director Haskell
Wexler also turned out Saturday to lend their support.
   Walden, Wexler and Wildman accompanied the cargo to Nicaragua,
which has not received any U.S. government aid. The Reagan
administration supports the Contra effort to overthrow Nicaragua's
leftist Sandinista government.
   The supplies will be distributed by an ecumenical coalition of
Nicaraguan churches, Walden said.
   ``This load will be absorbed in about three days,'' said Blase
Bonpane, director of the private Office of the Americas
organization, which assisted with fund-raising.
   The relief supplies were shipped on a DC-8 chartered by Operation
California, a private international relief group, at a cost of
$40,000.
   An additional 15 tons of supplies are ready to be shipped but
there is no transportation, Bonpane said.
   Borrowing a U.S. military cargo plane would save the relief group
$50,000, he said, but a request to use an Air National Guard C-130
has been pending in Washington since the hurricane hit, he said.
   ``They're sitting on it back there,'' said Bonpane.
   Office of the Americas is dedicated to peace in the hemisphere
and engages in hemispheric education and ``private diplomacy,'' he
said.
   ``This has nothing to do with anything but humanitarian aid.''

   Republican George Bush, in a frenzied campaign
swing aimed at bolstering his lead over Democratic rival Michael
Dukakis, declared today he was winding up his marathon race for the
presidency ``not in a power walk but in a sprint.''
   The vice president began last-day sweep through four states by
urging his rally audience in the Detroit suburb of Southfield to
vote in Tuesday's election. And when they go to the polls, he said,
they should ask themselves, ``Is the country headed in the right
direction?''
   Added Bush: ``The answer is, yes it is.''
   The GOP nominee took what appeared to be a veiled swipe at
Dukakis' penchant for getting exercise by speed walking with weights
in each hand.
   ``In a sense, Michigan is where we got our real start this
year,'' Bush said. ``And in a sense, it's a very important place to
be as we run right down to the finish line, not in a power walk but
in a sprint.''
   The close contest in Michigan ``could be the key to this whole
election,'' he said, referring to the importance of the big,
vote-heavy industrial states of the Middle West.
   Michigan was the first battleground in the race for the
Republican nomination, and it was there that Bush got his start by
beating Pat Robertson and Rep. Jack Kemp of New York.
   On Tuesday, Bush sought to counter criticism that he had set the
negative tone of the 1988 presidential campaign.
   ``I am getting sick and tired of my opponent's complaining about
the rough and tumble of this campaign, something he does every time
just before an election,'' Bush told a rally Sunday in the San
Fernando Valley of Los Angeles.
   ``He seems to forget the past. He seems to forget those personal
attacks night after night on me, on my character, at that idiotic
Democratic convention.''
   The vice president said voters can see through the ``smoke
screen,'' and that ``all that's left is this daily whining about a
negative campaign.''
   ``My advice to the liberal governor of Massachusetts ... is `look
my friend, if you can't stand the heat, get the hell out of the
kitchen,''' Bush later told an outdoor rally in Covina, Calif.
   After a day of courting voters in Colorado and California, Bush
tried to put Michigan firmly into his pocket and then headed for
Missouri and Ohio, two other states where the race is close, before
spending tonight and Election Day in Houston.
   Tonight, Bush was making his final appeal to voters nationwide in
a paid half-hour broadcast on the CBS, NBC and ABC networks.
   Campaign officials said Sunday that their tracking polls showed
slippage in Bush's support last week had subsided.
   But other polls for news organizations over the weekend showed
some volatility, with Democratic rival Michael Dukakis gaining a
little ground.
   National polls released Sunday showed Bush ahead by margins
ranging from five to 12 points. Surveys of the 50 states indicated,
however, with indications that the GOP nominee has more than enough
states firmly in his column to garner the 270 Electoral College
votes needed for victory.
   Campaign manager Lee Atwater told reporters Bush forces believe a
Republican victory in either Ohio, Michigan or Missouri would
foreclose any chance Dukakis might have of putting together a
combination that adds up to 270 electoral votes.
   California, where Bush spent Sunday seeking the nation's biggest
electoral prize of 47 votes, was considered a tossup in the final
weekend before Election Day in the GOP campaign's own polls, Bush
aides said.
   ``We feel good with our electoral strength we have in both our
strong states and those that are leaning to us,'' campaign Chief of
Staff Craig Fuller said of the Republican nominee's own polling
figures.
   Sunday's theme from Bush and his surrogates was Dukakis'
complaints about the Bush campaign attacks.
   Atwater called the Dukakis criticism ``hypocritical'' because, he
claimed, the Democrats started the campaign attacks when they
derided Bush at their Atlanta convention this summer. He called the
convention a `three-day mudslinging festival.`
   Those comments, and similar themes voiced by other campaign
spokesmen came on a day when The New York Times published a poll
showing most respondents blamed Bush principally for the negative
tone of race.
   While blasting Dukakis for attacking his attacks, Bush kept up
the offensive. ``He is naive. He is totally inexperienced in foreign
policy,'' Bush said of his opponent.
   Atwater said one of the campaign's biggest concerns was getting
out the vote, a theme Bush has raised continually in the past week
in urging Republican voters against complacency.
   ``I never felt better, or stronger or more ready to fight for
every vote out there,'' the vice president said at the San Fernando
Valley rally.
   Bush aides, meantime, looked beyond Election Day to what an
electoral landslide could mean to the Republican as president.
   ``Anything we can do to enhance George Bush's electoral strength
by harnessing our resources ... should increase George Bush's
electoral lead and strengthen his hand as president,'' said Fuller.

<HEAD>Spelman's New President Urges Students To Help The Poor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students at Spelman College, a black women's
school, should take the fruits of their education back to their
communities and help the poor, the school's new president said at
her inauguration.
   ``If we do nothing to improve our world, then we cannot call
ourselves educated women,'' Johnetta B. Cole said Sunday. ``How can
we call ourselves either educated or leaders if we turn away from
the very reality that a third of black America lives in poverty?
   ``We must build sturdy black bridges into the very communities
from which we have come. For if we do not build those bridges, then
we will surely drown in our own selfishness.''
   Ms. Cole, first black woman president of the 107-year-old liberal
arts college, was inaugurated Sunday although she has been at the
school since July 1987. Her speech wrapped up a weekend that
included the announcement of a $20 million gift to the school from
entertainer Bill Cosby.
   One of Cosby's daughters attended Spelman, and episodes of his
hit TV series, ``The Cosby Show,'' have been filmed there.
   The donation will be used mostly to construct an academic center,
which will double the college's classroom space. About $8 million
will go to Spelman's endowment, currently at $42 million.

   About 600 people were killed or injured by an
earthquake that shook a remote mountain jungle region of southern
China, the state-run China International Broadcasting Station said
today.
   The station said it did not have a breakdown on how many of the
600 were dead and how many injured in Sunday's quake.
   The radio report could not immediately be confirmed
independently. The State Seismology Bureau in Beijing, which earlier
reported 18 dead and 54 injured, said it had no new information.
   The highest previous count was from the official Xinhua News
Agency, which reported at least 37 deaths and said more than 100
people were injured. Telephone service was cut off to the affected
region, in Yunnan province near the Burmese border.
   The quake measured 7.6 on the Richter scale, and was followed
overnight and early today by 34 aftershocks, the strongest measuring
7.2 on the Richter scale.
   Roads to the affected area were impassable and Yunnan authorities
ordered an airlift of food, medicine and other relief supplies.
Yunnan Gov. He Zhiqiang flew to the scene to direct rescue work.
   Xinhua said most houses were destroyed in Lancang and Menglian
counties, which were at the epicenter of the quake. The population
of the counties was not immediately available, but officials said
the area is sparsely inhabited.
   Buildings also were destroyed in 14 surrounding counties, Xinhua
said. Most homes in that part of China are simple mud and wood
structures.
   Crews were working to repair roads, and radio contact was
established, Xinhua said.
   Lancang is home to the Lahu minority group, and the Va minority
group also lives in the region.
   There are about 300,000 Lahu people, most of them in Yunnan
province. They are related to Tibetans and Burmans and practice
Buddhism. The Va people number about 260,000, speak a language of
the Mon-Khmer branch and are Buddhists. Both groups are primarily
farmers.
   At about the same time as the first quake in China, a less
powerful temblor was reported in northern Thailand near the Burmese
border. The quake caused minor damage to buildings and made
high-rise buildings sway in Bangkok, hundreds of miles to the south.
   In the ``Skylounge'' restaurant on the top floor of the 43-story
Baiyoke Tower, Bangkok's tallest building, hundreds of panicked
patrons fled without paying their bills.
   The quake in China was also felt in Yunnan's capital, Kunming,
240 miles northeast of Lancang, a city of 1.5 million residents. The
seismology bureau said there was no damage there.
   A quake measuring 5.0 on the Richter scale hit the Lancang region
Oct. 15, but there were no reports of casualties.
   The Yunnan quake was the second in China during the weekend.
   On Saturday, a quake measuring 7.0 on the Richter scale shook
northern Tibet and Qinghai province in far western China. Qinghai
seismology officials said the epicenter was in an uninhabited area
of the Tanggula Mountains and there were no reports of casualties.
   Earthquakes occur frequently both in the Tanggula Mountains and
the series of mountain chains that stretch along China's southern
border. However, quakes measuring 7 or more on the Richter scale are
rare.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A quake measuring 7 is capable of causing heavy damage
in a populated area, while one measuring 8 is 10 times as strong and
capable of tremendous damage.
   China is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world,
and seismology officials predicted in 1985 that quake activity would
increase through the end of the century.
   The last major quake was on Aug. 23, 1985, when a temblor
measuring 7.4 on the Richter scale killed 71 people and injured 125
in the far western Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
   China's worst earthquake in modern times was the temblor
measuring 7.8 that leveled the northeastern industrial city of
Tangshan on July 28, 1976, killing at 242,000 people by official
count.
   The world's most deadly earthquake ever was a Jan. 24, 1556
temblor in north-central China that killed 830,000 people.

   Tens of thousands of civil servants in government
offices, ports and prisons went on strike today to protest the
firing of union workers at Britain's intelligence-gathering
headquarters.
   A spokesman for the Council of Civil Service Unions, an umbrella
body for Britain's eight civil service unions, estimated 200,000
workers took part in the one-day walkout.
   Dozens of lunchtime rallies were held to protest the recent
firings of five men at the Government Communications Headquarters in
Cheltenham. The huge southwest England facility eavesdrops on the
Soviet Union, and the government maintains its work is too sensitive
to risk disruption by strikes.
   The firings provoked new charges that Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's government is undermining civil liberties.
   The union coalition reported ``80 percent-plus walkouts'' had
shut down many employment and welfare offices, state-run job and
driving-test centers across Britain.
   Civil servants also walked off jobs in customs offices, prisons,
airports, and magistrates courts, it said.
   ``We're thinking 200,000 is not a bad estimate,'' said
spokeswoman Anne Kenefeck.
   The five men have been fired for defying a 1984 ban on unions at
the facility, and another 12 men are facing retirement, compulsory
transfer or dismissal. They are the holdouts from among one-third of
the 7,000 employees at the facility who were union members in 1984.
   At the time, most accepted about $1,400 in compensation to quit
their union.
   Critics see the firings as the latest occasion on which the
Thatcher government has chosen to sacrifice an element of individual
freedom for what it calls the national interest.
   ``The present dispute is one aspect of a much larger debate,''
says Donald Cameron Watt, a professor of international history at
the London School of Economics. ``It's become a party policy issue
over the issue of openness of information, the reform of secrecy
(laws).''
   The firings follow two highly controversial clampdowns. In
October, the government banned broadcast interviews with members of
the Irish Republican Army and 10 other militant Northern Ireland
groups and announced plans to remove any suspects' right to remain
silent under police questioning.
   At Cheltenham, the unions have lost a string of legal battles and
have no chance of overturning the ban, but refuse to back down.
   None of the holdouts had been fired until this year, although
union officials say the government tried to freeze them out with
tactics such as refusing them pay raises.
   Mike Grindley, a Chinese-language expert, estimates he lost 5,000
to 6,000 pounds ($8,850 to $10,000) in raises before being fired in
October. He now works full time on the campaign.
   ``We don't think about the money too much,'' Grindley, 51, said
in a telephone interview. ``It hasn't been easy, but there's been
compensation. ... You can hold your head up high.''
   In imposing the ban, Mrs. Thatcher cited pay strikes in 1979-81
that disrupted work at Cheltenham, the European center of Soviet
eavesdropping for NATO.
   The headquarters intercepts radio signals and other
communications from the Soviet Union and its East bloc allies.
   The facility attracted international attention in 1982 when
Geoffrey Prime, a translator in Russian at the facility, was
uncovered as a Soviet agent. Prime, described as one of the West's
most damaging post-World War II traitors, was sentenced to 35 years
in prison.
   ``You can make quite a strong case on the government point,''
said Professor Watt, who also is a member of the editorial board of
the Journal of Intelligence and National Security.
   ``The government believed they had a case, it wasn't just
union-bashing,'' he added in an interview. ``They operate on a
worst-case analysis, and (strikes) were something they had very good
reason to think would happen.''
   The unions reply that strikes never affected security and that
the government rejected a 1984 offer of a no-strike deal.
   Some Thatcher supporters have expressed unease at the
government's refusal to compromise in the Cheltenham dispute.
   Commentator Nicholas Comfort, writing in the pro-Conservative
Party Daily Telegraph newspaper on the growing power of the state
over the individual, said the government ``could have reached a
no-strike agreement if it had tried.''
   ``It is not just the threat of terrorism which has brought fresh
intervention into our daily lives,'' Comfort added.

   George Bush is mounting a last-minute
television attack on Michael Dukakis with a fierce five-minute ad
criticizing the Massachusetts governor on his handling of everything
from crime to the environment.
   The Bush ad, coming amid a flurry of upbeat musical commercials
and tonight's relatively tame 30-minute network appeals, summarizes
the attacks Republican Bush has been making against his Democratic
opponent in ads and on the stump throughout the election season.
   ``It's running in selected markets. It's a broad overview of
everything that Michael Dukakis stands for, according to his
record,'' Bush ad director Sig Rogich said today. Rogich denied the
ad was introduced in response to narrowing poll margins; he said it
had been ``planned long ago'' and was ``in the works for weeks,
literally.''
   The five-minute ad features Massachusetts residents and officials
complaining about Dukakis' handling of pollution in Boston Harbor,
the state's prisoner furlough program and the state's economy,
including taxes, jobs and budget shortfalls. Bush does not appear.
   In addition to eleventh-hour attack ads, TV viewers also are
being treated to sentimental media closings featuring flags,
children and old people.
   The double-barrelled, multi-million dollar windup concludes a
campaign season shaped to an unprecedented degree by television _
from 10-second sound bites and 30-second ads to extended interviews.
The finale comes tonight, when each candidate airs 30-minute appeals
on the three networks at a cost of $1 million for each campaign.
   Even the ads acknowledge TV's pervasive presence. Bush's musical
spot features several scenes of people watching him on their TV
sets. Dukakis is shown in one of his spots watching a Bush attack ad
and switching off the set in disgust.
   The fall campaigns began with made-for-TV conventions awash in
flags, balloons, children and TelePrompTers, the halls carefully
refashioned with seating, podiums and colors suitable for the small
screen.
   The Dukakis program at 8 p.m. EST showcases the Massachusetts
governor answering questions in a town meeting setting and contains
footage of his family and his running mate, Texas Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen. During the program, Dukakis urges Americans to ``look in
the mirror and ask yourself _ Is George Bush on your side? I want to
give every American a chance to build a better life.''
   The Bush effort at 8:30 p.m. EST summarizes the vice president's
resume, beliefs and plans for the nation.
   The two candidates set records this year for money spent on
commercials (expected to top $30 million apiece) and for free air
time on news, talk and interview shows (at all hours of day and
night).
   Some say the campaigns also set a record for negative
advertising. But while a mixture of ads remained on the air to the
end, the mood of some of the newer spots was uplifting.
   Rogich and Jim Weller, part of the team that brought viewers the
``Morning in America'' ads of President Reagan's 1984 campaign,
evoke the same mood for the vice president with the same song _
``God Bless the USA,'' a patriotic country ballad sung by Lee
Greenwood.
   There are the TV-watching scenes, a grandmother and grandchild,
several Pledges of Allegiance, Bush with world leaders and Bush with
children dressed up as pilgrims for a play. Sings Greenwood: ``If
tomorrow all the things were gone I worked for all my life ... I'd
thank my lucky stars to be living here today cause the flag still
stands for freedom and they can't take that away.''
   The lyrics in Dukakis' ``Anthem'' commercial reflect the
Democrat's more complicated task of promising a better future
without badmouthing the present. ``The time is soon,'' the singers
say as a young mother caresses a baby's face. ``A bright future is
what we're going to see. We keep reaching out for better and we will
never say never because we know where we come from. The best America
... is yet to come.''
   The most memorable commercials of the campaign were less upbeat.
   ``Revolving Door,'' a Bush spot, showed a procession of inmates
filing in and out of a revolving iron gate, then an ominous aerial
view of prison grounds and a guard tower. The narrator says Dukakis
vetoed the death penalty and ``gave weekend furloughs to
first-degree murderers not eligible for parole. While out, many
committed other crimes like kidnapping and rape and many are still
at large.''
   Dukakis struck back, belatedly, first with a ``Packaging of
George Bush'' series that struck a raw nerve among consultants and
columnists. Too confusing, too elitist, they said of the spots,
which showed actors playing cynical Bush handlers trying to disguise
their candidate's alleged shortcomings.
   Bush mocked Dukakis' tank ride and derided his defense positions;
Dukakis castigated Bush's choice of running mate Dan Quayle and
denounced Bush's performance as head of anti-terrorism and drug task
forces. Dukakis is ``on your side,'' his campaign ads pledged.
``America can't afford that risk,'' Bush's ads retorted.
   Did any of it matter? Yes, according to early indications.
   In a 1984 post-election poll of registered voters, 12 percent
said commercials had helped them decide how to vote. Asked the same
question in a CBS-New York Times poll late last month, 25 percent of
probable voters admitted their decision was influenced by
commercials.

   Two officers have been suspended after the killing
of an unarmed prisoner who was shot when he freed himself from
handcuffs and tried to escape, authorities said.
   The officers fired at least 12 shots, said Harris County
sheriff's Lt. Ruben Diaz.
   Roland Brothers Jr., 28, of Lafayette, La., was struck by at
least three bullets, two in the chest, the county medical examiner's
office said Sunday.
   Some witnesses told reporters that the officers continued
shooting after Brothers fell, but Chief Deputy Sheriff Tommy Thomas
said Sunday that they refused to talk to investigators and that
other witnesses had disputed their reports.
   ``They didn't have to keep shooting that man,'' said witness
Elaine White. She told reporters that after the man was shot in the
leg and in the torso, he said: ```Hey man, I'm not going anywhere.'''
   Brothers, wanted on a felony escape and several other warrants,
was booked by police Saturday in suburban Jersey Village for
unauthorized use of a vehicle and then turned over to sheriff's
Detectives Barry Rizk and Robert Nichols, Diaz said.
   Brothers, whose record included four Harris County escape charges
and one Louisiana escape, was handcuffed and immobilized by a leg
brace during the drive to the county jail, Diaz said.
   But Brothers managed to remove the leg brace and free his right
hand from the cuffs, and when the two detectives stopped the car in
the Harris County jail garage, he left their car and started
running, authorities said. The detectives shouted for him to stop,
Diaz said.
   Brothers, initially identified as Michael Reed, an alias, ran
toward the jail's garage door, which was closing.
   ``Both (detectives) knew they could not reach Reed (Brothers)
before the door closed _ he would have been outside; they were
inside,'' Diaz said.
   The officers then fired about 12 shots, and Brothers fell outside
the door.
   ``The number of times he was shot is immaterial,'' said District
Attorney John B. Holmes Jr. ``The investigation is whether he was
escaping. I don't see there appears to be much doubt to that.''
   Holmes said state law allows use of deadly force to prevent an
escape.
   A handcuff key was found in Brothers' underwear at the medical
examiner's office, Diaz said.
   Rizk, 29, and Nichols, 34, were relieved of duty with pay pending
an investigation by the sheriff's homicide and internal affairs
divisions and the district attorney's office.

<HEAD>Elderly Couple Sues Son Over Ownership Of Their Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The case of an elderly couple suing their
son in an effort to regain ownership of their own home is not as
unusual as it might sound, say advocates for the elderly.
   Hyman Freeman, a retired fruit seller, and his wife, Frances,
were persuaded two years ago by their 52-year-old son, Leonard, to
put their house in his name to save money on inheritance taxes.
   According to the elder Freemans, who are in their late 70s, the
agreement was that their son would be responsible for upkeep of the
house while his parents lived there on a 25-year lease. Under the
arrangement, if the parents wanted to they could cancel it and take
the house back in their name, they said.
   But the Freemans say their son didn't keep his word. So this
summer they filed suit, accusing him of defrauding them of their
home. They want the property back and without the $100,000 mortgage
they say their son took out on the house to get a line of credit,
The Boston Sunday Globe reported.
   Said Mrs. Freeman: ``We haven't slept nights. ... It's pretty
tough when your son does that to you _ and after you've been so good
to him.''
   The son, a musician and court officer in Boston Land Court, has
declined comment. And his lawyer, Paul Driscoll, said, ``I want to
try my cases in court and not in the arena of public opinion.
   ``If you were in litigation with your father, would you want it
in the newspaper?'' he told the Globe.
   Such cases are not unusual, say advocates for senior citizens.
   Ellen Bruce, managing attorney for Greater Boston Elderly Legal
Services, said her office handles five or six cases per year of
people who say they were induced to give their homes to younger
family members.
   ``It's done much too often without seniors getting proper legal
advice,'' Ms. Bruce said. ``They trust their children.''
   The elder Freeman said he agreed to the arrangement but made it
clear to his son that the house was only to be in the son's name.
   The two sides are scheduled to meet in court in January.

   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide a
recurring copyright question by reviewing a dispute over a sculpture
depicting the plight of the homeless.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by the Community for
Creative Non-Violence (CCNV) and its founder, Mitch Snyder, who seek
exclusive copyright ownership of the work.
   CCNV, which is based in the nation's capital, decided in 1985 to
participate in the annual Christmas Pageant of Peace here by
sponsoring a display dramatizing the plight of the homeless.
   Snyder and other CCNV members commissioned James Earl Reid, a
Baltimore, Md., sculptor, to create a work entitled ``Third World
America.''
   Using a synthetic substance called Design Cast 62 that would be
tinted to resemble bronze, Reid agreed to sculpt two adult figures
and a child huddled on a streetside steam grate.
   The life-sized figures were intended to be part of an updated
Nativity scene.
   CCNV provided a steam grate and pedestal for the work.
   Reid was paid $15,000 for expenses and for his assistants. He
donated his own services without charge.
   CCNV sent the entire sculpture back to Reid in January 1986 for
some repairs.
   The group planned to take the sculpture on a tour of several
cities to raise money for the homeless.
   But Reid objected to the tour because, he said, the sculpture was
too fragile. He urged CCNV to cast the work in bronze or make a
master mold that would withstand the tour.
   CCNV declined, but said Reid could do so if he wished.
   Two months later, Reid refused to return the sculpture and
registered it in his own name. He also said he planned to take the
work on a less ambitious exhibition tour.
   CCNV then filed a lawsuit claiming exclusive copyright ownership
of the sculpture.
   A federal judge ruled in favor of the organization on grounds the
sculpture was ``a work made for hire'' whose copyright is owned by
CCNV.
   But the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the judge's
decision and ordered further hearings in the case.
   The appeals court said the physical work itself is owned by CCNV.
But it said the organization may have to share with Reid the
copyright and any profits derived from the work and credit for its
creation.
   ``Intense as CCNV's participation in the project may have been,
Reid, as sculptor, contributed more than a minimal amount of
creativity to `Third World America','' the appeals court said.
   ``That is enough ... to render (Reid) an author of a protected
work'' under a 1976 revision of federal copyright law, the appeals
court said.
   The only question left to be decided is whether CCNV and Reid
should share the copyright ownership, the appeals court said as it
sent the case back to a federal judge.
   The Copyright Justice Coalition, representing more than 100,000
artists, urged the Supreme Court to adopt the appeals court's
interpretation of the 1976 copyright law.
   ``It is critically important for free-lance creators to be able
to claim authorship of their own works in order to build a
reputation that attracts new clients,'' the coalition said.
``Equally as important, free-lance creators rely heavily on the
income-producing potential associated with ownership of the
copyrights in their works.''
   Denying artists such protection ``will dry up our national
resources of free-lance creative talent,'' the coalition added.
   The case is Community for Creative Non-Violence vs. Reid, 88-293.

   A late-night fire spread smoke throughout a house
with tightly locked doors and no smoke alarm, killing four
youngsters and their grandmother, officials said.
   ``The call came in from a neighbor who said there was some smoke
coming out from the house next door and they tried to raise some
people, but got no response,'' said a Fire Department dispatcher who
wouldn't give his name.
   Fire Investigator Mike Southerland said the house was secured
with ``double-key'' deadbolts, a type of lock which requires
separate keys to lock the house from the inside and outside.
   ``It is not the type we like people to have,'' said Southerland,
adding that fire officials had not determined if the locks prevented
escape.
   The fire broke out shortly after 11 p.m. Sunday in the one-story
home not equipped with smoke alarms, officials said. Fire officials
said it was extinguished quickly.
   Fire investigator Randy Sanders said a cause had not been
determined.
   Hospital officials believe all the victims suffered smoke
inhalation.
   The victims were identified as Sierra Faggett, 17 months; Marcus
Faggett, 2; Latrece Faggett, 13; Terrance Faggett, 17, and Mary
Graham, 71.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal by a
company challenging federal guidelines for controlling and removing
asbestos in school buildings.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the
regulations are reasonable.
   The National Gypsum Co., a leading former producer of asbestos,
said guidelines adopted by the Environmental Protection Agency are
too vague, give school officials too much discretion and lack
scientific standards.
   The company said the agency failed to carry out the mission
assigned to it by a 1986 federal law that called for steps to
protect the public against possible cancer-causing exposure to
asbestos.
   ``Rather than doing what Congress had commanded, (EPA) simply
repeated the vague generalities which had been the substance of its
previous guidance and left it to local school authorities (and)
self-interested asbestos abatement consultants to select a response
action which would presumably protect human health and the
environment,'' the company said.
   The company could be hit with lawsuits seeking reimbursement by
school districts for costly asbestos cleanup measures.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled last May that the
EPA guidelines ``represent a reasonable interpretation'' of a law
that is ``somewhat contradictory.''
   For example, the appeals court said the agency properly decided
that school officials could require removal of asbestos from
buildings.
   The appeals court also rejected the company's demand that the
agency determine what levels of asbestos exposure are safe.
   There is no agreement among scientists about how much exposure is
hazardous, the appeals court said.
   Asbestos historically was used widely in construction _ as a
flame retardant, for acoustical reasons, as insulation for pipes and
boilers and in ceiling and floor tiles.
   National Gypsum said that more than 100,000 school buildings are
affected by the EPA guidelines.
   ``The cost of compliance is estimated to be in excess of $3
billion,'' the company said, and it could go far higher if the
guidelines are extended to cover other buildings.
   The Reagan administration, urging the Supreme Court to reject the
company's appeal, said National Gypsum distorted the significance of
the EPA guidelines.
   Most of the cost associated with asbestos cleanup is for
inspections and plans that schools must develop, the Justice
Department said. And, department lawyers said, National Gypsum is
not challenging requirements that schools conduct inspections and
develop plans for dealing with asbestos.
   The case is National Gypsum vs. U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, 88-241.

<HEAD>Queen Mother Sent Christmas Cards To Windsors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christmas cards found in the Paris home of the late
Duke and Duchess of Windsor indicate the Queen Mother Elizabeth
sought to heal the rift caused by the abdication of King Edward
VIII, Press Association reported.
   The British domestic news agency said Sunday the recent discovery
of the cards counters reports of a continuing feud between the Queen
Mother, now aged 88, and the Windsors. It said the cards show the
Queen Mother made overtures of affection to her brother-in-law and
his wife.
   Edward abdicated in 1936 to marry American divorcee Wallis
Warfield Simpson, and was succeeded by his brother, King George VI,
husband of the Queen Mother. George died in 1952.
   The Windsors lived out their lives in France, where the duke died
in 1972 and the duchess died in 1986. Press Association's court
correspondent Tom Corby and photographer Ron Bell toured the
Windsors' Paris mansion over the weekend.
   Corby wrote that conservationists are restoring the building for
Mohammed Al-Fayed, to whom the city of Paris assigned the lease
after the death of the duchess. Al-Fayed owns Harrods department
store in London and the Ritz Hotel in Paris.
   Corby said among the memorabilia found in the mansion were
Christmas cards from members of the British royal family.
   Corby said that in the 10 years or so before the duke's death,
there appeared to be a reconciliation. In 1968, he said, the Queen
Mother, signing herself Elizabeth, sent her ``best wishes'' for
Christmas ``with my love''.
   He said the current British monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, her
husband and other relatives also sent seasonal wishes to the
Windsors.

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis raced from state to state
the day before the presidential voting, declaring the race was
getting tighter and promising a comeback victory in ``a November
surprise.''
   Democrat Dukakis, pinning his hopes of overtaking George Bush on
more than two days of non-stop stumping, spoke at sunrise to a
boisterous crowd of several hundred supporters at a union hall in a
Cleveland suburb, then flew to St. Louis.
   He was greeted at the St. Louis airport by a band playing, ``Rock
Around the Clock,'' a fitting choice for his no-rest final effort.
   ``They talk a lot about October surprises in an election
campaign,'' he told supporters. ``Tomorrow we're going to have a
November surprise.''
   ``The race is very, very tight. It's getting tighter by the
hour,'' Dukakis said.
   He flew to Brook Park, Ohio, on a ``red-eye'' flight from
Spokane, Wash., before heading to St. Louis and was flying west
again for a full day of campaigning in California.
   In all, the trip to the Midwest, added to the schedule Sunday,
had Dukakis traveling more than 4,000 miles in eight hours.
   Dukakis, who caught a two-hour nap on the flight east, had more
stops planned on another cross-country flight early Tuesday,
including a pre-dawn rally in Iowa, on the last leg of a journey
that would ultimately bring him home to Boston to vote.
   ``I don't need sleep; I'm charging,'' he said.
   At the rally this morning, held in a United Auto Workers union
hall, Dukakis continued his attacks on Bush and Republican Vice
Presidential nominee Dan Quayle and promised to be a president who
stands up for American workers.
   ``I'm not running for president to help the sharp operators on
Wall Street,'' Dukakis said, ``I'm running to help the lathe
operators and the machine operators.''
   Despite little sleep, Dukakis was in high spirits. ``Good
Morning, Ohio,'' he declared at the opening of his speech. ``We took
the red-eye to be with the Buckeyes.''
   Then, acknowledging that he trails Bush, Dukakis asked, ``Is Ohio
going to let the pollsters and the pundits decide this election or
are you going to send a message to them?''
   Later in the speech, he said ``We're going to win in Ohio, and
all across this country.''
   As Dukakis stumped Sunday his focus was on his populist appeal
and Quayle, the Indiana senator and GOP vice presidential nominee.
   He scoffed at Bush for borrowing the Democrat's ``I'm on your
side'' line and said the vice president was so worried that his lead
was eroding that he now was following Dukakis around the country.
   ``I'll tell you one place he's not following Mike Dukakis and
Lloyd Bentsen,'' Dukakis told crowds in Westminster, Colo.;
Portland, Ore., and the Washington cities of Tacoma and Spokane.
``He's not following us to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.''
   Dukakis also pressed his contention that a man who would pick
Quayle to be a heartbeat away from the presidency lacks the judgment
to be president, honing the attack on a Bush comment that he would
consider putting Quayle in charge of the White House's crisis
management team.
   ``Dan Quayle managing the Cuban missile crisis, think about it,''
Dukakis told about 20,000 people at an outdoor rally at Portland
State University. ``We can't afford to take that risk. Dan Quayle
isn't a crisis manager _ he's a crisis that has to be managed.''
   Dukakis said Bush's only new idea during the campaign has been a
tax cut for the rich while the Democrat listed his proposals on
college financing, health care, a ban on offshore oil drilling in
certain areas and his support for the Equal Rights Amendment and
comparable pay for women.
   ``He's slipping and sliding; we're rocking and rolling,'' an
upbeat Dukakis told his rallies. ``Americans all over the country
are looking hard at this campaign and asking themselves the
fundamental question: Which candidate will stand up for working
families in this country.''
   Dukakis took questions from students at the University of Puget
Sound in Tacoma, Wash., Sunday night and was asked whether he
thought liberal had become a dirty word.
   ``No, I think Mr. Bush is trying to make it a dirty word, and I
object to that,'' the Massachusetts governor said.
   Dukakis, according to most national polls, has cut into Bush's
lead but still faces a formidable task if he is to break the
Republican's apparent lock on the Electoral College.
   National polls released Sunday showed Bush ahead by margins
ranging from five to 12 points, but 50-state surveys indicated that
the GOP nominee has more than enough states firmly in his column to
garner the 270 electoral votes needed to elect.
   According to aides, Dukakis is counting on winning California,
Illinois, Michigan and Pennsylvania, all major states in which polls
show a tight race. His chances appear to hinge on beating Bush in at
least one of three other big states where he trails Bush _ Ohio, New
Jersey and Texas _ although Dukakis aides insist there are other
scenarios that could produce a Dukakis win.
   Dukakis campaign vice chairman John Sasso, who has been directing
the campaign from the road as he travels with Dukakis, told
reporters Sunday that polling in the past 24 hours showed movement
toward Dukakis among undecided voters and soft Bush supporters.
   He said Bush's recent schedule changes to visit states shortly
after Dukakis showed the Bush campaign was worried that Dukakis was
closing the gap.
   ``I want to see if he's going to follow us now _ in the next 48
hours,'' Sasso said after informing reporters of Dukakis' plans to
campaign virtually without sleep from Sunday through Tuesday
afternoon.

   An anonymous phone call led entertainer
Redd Foxx to most of the jewelry stolen from his home in a $3
million burglary, including a half-pound gold watch given to him by
Elvis Presley.
   Foxx said he received the call Sunday afternoon at his home.
   ``Someone called and said if you want your stuff go to the fence
and get it before someone else does,'' Foxx said. ``My neighbor, Dan
Parker, went outside and a garbage bag was hanging from the fence.''
   According to a police report, the burglary occurred sometime
between Thursday, when Foxx, who starred as junk dealer Fred Sanford
on the television series ``Sanford and Son,'' left the city, and
Saturday, when he returned.
   Jewelry, furs and $107,000 in cash was taken.
   ``It has four lion heads on it with diamonds around the necks and
was designed by Elvis and engraved on the inside of it,'' he said of
the watch.
   Prince Spencer, Foxx's manager, said the burglars used an
electric saw to get into the side entrance of the house.
   ``They knew what they were doing because they cut through two
entrances so that they could enter and exit without the alarm going
off,'' Spencer said. ``Once they were inside, they got through a
sealed alarm closet and then they found a camouflaged safe and took
the money out without a forced entry. They bypassed all of the
alarms in the house.''

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Bar Against Cameras, Microphones from Presser
Trial</HEAD>

   The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling that
barred television and still cameras and radio broadcasting equipment
from a Teamsters Union embezzlement trial.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by media
representatives in Cleveland who said banning broadcast and
photographic coverage of an important union corruption case violates
the Constitution's free-press guarantees.
   The late union president Jackie Presser and two local Teamsters
officials in Cleveland were indicted in 1986 on charges they
violated a federal anti-racketeering law by embezzling union funds.
The three were accused of keeping so-called ```ghost employees'' on
the payroll of Teamsters Local 507.
   Presser, who died in July of cardiac arrest before the trial
began, was an FBI informant who said he participated in the
payroll-padding scheme with the bureau's approval.
   The trial of the two others, Local 507 President Harold Friedman
and secretary Anthony Hughes, began Oct. 12.
   In 1987, TV news reporter Mike Conway, radio news broadcaster
Judy Thompson and photographer Ted Schwartz asked to be allowed to
bring cameras and other equipment into the courtroom to cover the
upcoming trial.
   U.S. District Judge George W. White rejected their request.
   Banning cameras and the other broadcast equipment ``serves the
significant government interest of promoting fair and accurate
fact-finding by assuring that litigants and witnesses are not
distracted by media shyness or showboating,'' White said.
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld White's ruling in
July.
   The appeals court noted that a 1981 Supreme Court ruling said the
Constitution permits the broadcasting, televising or photographing
of criminal trials.
   But, the appeals court said, that ``is a far cry from holding
that the Constitution does require that these activities be
permitted during judicial proceedings.''
   The media representatives said banning such coverage of trials
``promotes nothing more than federal judicial insularity.''
   They said, ``Limiting access to a trial to the print media alone
and to those few members of the public fortunate enough to squeeze
into the courtroom in a case of great public interest denies
first-hand, real-time access to tens of millions of citizens.''
   They also said that modern technology permits TV cameras and
radio equipment to be used unobtrusively.
   Most states permit some electronic media coverage of judicial
proceedings. But the federal courts, including the Supreme Court,
ban such coverage.
   The case is Conway vs. U.S., 88-601.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected a free-press
challenge to a judge's order that barred participants in the
criminal trial of ex-Rep. Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y., from talking to news
reporters.
   The court, over three dissenting votes, turned away arguments
that the ``gag order'' a federal judge imposed during the
since-completed Wedtech Corp. corruption trial was an unlawful prior
restraint.
   Justices Byron R. White, William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall
voted to hear arguments in the case. But the votes of at least four
justices are needed to grant such review.
   White, in an opinion joined by Brennan and Marshall, said the
high court should resolve a conflict among federal appeals courts
over the issue of gag orders.
   Biaggi, who has given up the congressional seat he held for 20
years, was convicted of extortion, tax evasion, bribery and
conspiracy last August.
   Prosecutors said Biaggi extorted money from Wedtech, a defense
contractor in his south Bronx congressional district, in exchange
for his political clout.
   Biaggi stood trial with six others criminally charged in the
Wedtech scandal.
   Before the much-publicized trial began, U.S. District Judge John
M. Cannella ordered the defendants, their lawyers and the federal
prosecutors to refrain from making public statements about the case
other than to repeat what already was a matter of public record.
   Various news organizations objected to the order, contending that
it imposed a constitutionally impermissible prior restraint on the
press and on the free-speech rights of the trial participants.
   Past Supreme Court decisions have said prior restraints on speech
rarely are justified, and may be used only as a last resort to
ensure fair trials.
   But the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in upholding the
Wedtech trial gag order last March 14, ruled that it was not really
a prior restraint.
   ``There is a fundamental difference between a gag order
challenged by the individual gagged and the one challenged by a
third party; an order objected to by the former is properly
characterized as a prior restraint, one opposed solely by the latter
is not,'' the appeals court said.
   The appeals court suggested that it would be a prior restraint on
the press only if the news media already had the information and
were barred from publishing it.
   The appeals court noted that Cannella was troubled by what seemed
to be leaked information about the Wedtech-connected prosecutions.
   ``The problem begins not with the publishing of news by a free
press, but with a hemorrhage of small leaks of secret grand jury
information,'' the 2nd Circuit court said. ``This leads directly to
prosecutor and defense counsel inciting trial by the press.''
   In the appeal acted on today, five news organizations argued that
the appeals court wrongly subjected the gag order to a less rigorous
standard of review simply because it was challenged by potential
recipients of speech rather than potential speakers.
   The appeal urged the justices to outlaw such judicial orders
``without a finding that there is a serious and imminent threat to a
defendant's right to an impartial jury.''
   The five news organizations that filed the appeal are Dow Jones &
Co., CBS, NBC, The Associated Press and Newsday.
   The case is Dow Jones vs. Simon, 88-229.

<DATELINE>MALE, Maldives (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities today questioned about 100
people suspected of sympathizing with or taking part in last week's
failed coup in this Indian Ocean archipelago.
   The handcuffed prisoners were questioned at the National Security
Service office in the capital of Male, Maj. Mohammad Zahir said.
   He said most of them spoke Tamil, the language used by Sri Lankan
mercenaries who raided Male on Thursday and tried to overthrow
President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom's government.
   Maldivian officials said 14 people were killed and 40 wounded in
fighting Thursday. Some of the attackers took 27 hostages and fled
on a ship Friday, but the Indian navy forced their surrender at sea
Sunday.
   Indian commandos rescued 20 of the hostages, but four were
killed. Indian officials reported the three others missing.
   Zahir said officials detained 100 people ``because they had no
valid identification papers or travel documents on them, we suspect
some of them were involved in the attack or sympathized with it.''
   Also today, Maldivian officials said prepartions were under way
to install Gayoon for his third term as president Friday.
   Gayoon, 50, was elected president in 1978 after his predecessor
Ibrahim Nasir resigned and fled to Singapore. The 62-year-old Nasir
has been accused of misappropriating $4.2 million in state funds
during his 10-year rule.
   There were allegations that the failed coup was backed by Nasir.
Nasir has denied involvement.
   Gayoom has vowed to try the mercenaries. Asked what punishment
the mercenaries could receive if convicted, Gayoon said: ``I can't
tell you at this point, but we do have capital punishment.''
   Gayoom requested Indian assistance to quell the coup in his
2,000-island nation.
   The mercenaries gave up Sunday after the Indian frigate Godavari
fired on their vessel 60 miles from the Sri Lankan coast, Indian
officials said.
   Abdullah Luthufi, a Maldivian accused of masterminding the coup
attempt, was among 46 people who surrendered to the Indian commandos
aboard the cargo ship Progress Light, officials said.
   Luthufi was once an aide to Nasir, whose followers also tried to
overthrow Gayoom in 1980 and 1983.
   The foreign minister, Fathulla Jameel, said Luthufi hired the
mercenaries and came ashore with them Thursday.
   Maldivian and Indian officials say most of the 150-member
mercenary force escaped by sea. Indian naval ships have been
searching the area.

   A small earthquake jolted West Los Angeles
early today, but there were no reports of damage or injuries,
officials said.
   A quake measuring 2.6 on the Richter scale of ground motion
occurred at 5:27 a.m., said Robert Finn, a spokesman for the
California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. Its epicenter was
one mile south-southwest of Santa Monica, he said.
   Police at the West Los Angeles station felt the temblor, Lt.
Richard Molony said.
   ``It was a single jolt,'' Molony said. ``It was like someone
bumped into my desk.''
   The lieutenant said he sent his staff to check for damage in the
area, but received no reports of any problems.
   Quakes up to a magnitude of 3 usually produce little damage.
Temblors of 3.5 to 4 are usually considered mild, and those with
magnitudes of 4 to 5 are classified as moderate.
   A quake with a magnitude greater than 6 could inflict widespread
damage, with severe damage near the epicenter.

   Lloyd Bentsen, sharing the platform with a caged
quail, made a last-ditch appeal to salvage his home state of Texas
for the Democratic ticket today despite polls showing Michael
Dukakis trailing Republican candidate George Bush badly.
   ``It's in your hands to win it. You can do it,'' the Democratic
vice presidential nominee told 250 supporters at a Dallas rally.
``Go flat out ... win Texas and then the United States.''
   Standing near a live quail in a cage at Dallas' Union Station,
the Texas senator taunted Bush and running mate Dan Quayle. ``How do
you like the idea of George Bush as president and Dan Quayle
standing in the wings,'' he asked, turning his thumb down and
drawing hoots from the crowd.
   Bentsen was ending his campaign with a one-two punch at every
stop on election eve. He accused the Republicans of dirty
campaigning and assured his listeners that Democrats are friends of
working people.
   ``We're on your side and they are not,'' he said.
   Noting that nearly 200 Texas banks have failed in the past few
years, Bentsen accused the vice president of doing nothing for
Texas, which Bush claims as a residence, while the Reagan
administration was helping bankers in Illinois and New York.
   ``We want a Texan in there who's interested in Texas,'' Bentsen
said. ``We're going to help Texas.''
   Bentsen insists that Texas and its 29 electoral votes are
winnable for the Democrats, even though many polls show he and
Dukakis trailing by double digits.
   Dukakis' running mate was scouring Texas for votes and heading
via Louisiana for hastily arranged visits to Arkansas and Missouri.
His scheduled stops today included Shreveport, La., and Houston,
Beaumont and San Antonio, Texas.
   The schedule was originally scheduled to end after San Antonio,
but late Sunday the campaign added nighttime rallies in Little Rock,
Ark., and Kansas City, Mo. _ two states the Democrats are still
hoping to swing in their direction.
   In addition to his public stops, Bentsen will be doing interviews
via satellite with television stations in several other key states.
   ``We're doing hand-to-hand combat in Texas and we're going for
the airwaves'' in battleground states, said Mike McCurry, the
campaign's director of communications.
   The expanded schedule, he said, was ``to take advantage of a
dramatic tightening of the race'' in Missouri and Arkansas, McCurry
said. ``The question is whether it is enough time'' to bring about
an upset of the Republican ticket, he said.
   Dukakis himself has launched into around-the-clock campaigning
heading into Election Day, with an early morning event in Cleveland,
a stop in St. Louis and a return visit to California for a San
Francisco rally.
   However, the sleepless campaign swing was not being asked of the
67-year-old Bentsen.
   In El Paso on Sunday, Bentsen told a rally outside the city's
train station that the Democrats are concerned about the middle
class _ a theme Dukakis has been hammering in his campaign stops.
   ``Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen are on the side of the working
men and women of America and the Republicans are on the other
side,'' said the Democratic candidate, who addressed the crowd in
both Spanish and English _ an appeal to the state's large Hispanic
population.
   Like Dukakis, Bentsen has for the past few weeks made attacks on
the negative tone of the Republican campaign a central theme of his
own. The backlash from the GOP ``distortions,'' Bentsen says, is a
major factor in the Democrats' narrowing of the Republican lead in
the polls.
   Surveys released Sunday showed Bush leading Dukakis by margins
ranging from five points to 12 points.
   Bentsen told reporters on Sunday that the tone of the campaign
has hurt both Bush and Dukakis, and said that no matter who wins,
neither one will have a ``serious mandate.''
   ``I certainly don't think George Bush will have a mandate because
of the negative campaign that's been run,'' he said.
   As for his Democratic running mate, Bentsen said: ``Michael
Dukakis will not have as much as a mandate as he deserves because it
was difficult to get the issues across with all the clutter of
negative advertising,'' he said.
   ``But I also believe the two of us together, with me as vice
president ... that we will be able to get our legislative program
through better than George Bush and Dan Quayle would.''
   The lack of a mandate ``means more work and a lot more swabbing
that has to be done, and I think Mike Dukakis can do that,'' he said.

<HEAD>Official Media Attacks Walesa as Strike Threat Looms</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 8 grafs with media attack on Walesa; PICKS up 5th

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The official media today launched an attack
on Lech Walesa in response to the Solidarity leader's threat of
strikes unless authorities suspend the decision to close the Lenin
Shipyard in Gdansk.
   An editorial in the Communist Party daily Trybuna Ludu said, ``In
the past, it was alleged that when the authorities lacked arguments,
they resorted to repression. Today, when Lech Walesa lacks
arguments, he loads the strike cannon.''
   The editorial follows remarks by the leader of the banned union
federation Sunday that he was prepared to call a nationwide ``strike
alert'' to demand preservation of the 10,000-worker shipyard, the
birthplace of Solidarity.
   The commentary was unusual because the official press recently
had avoided criticizing Walesa by name while the government and the
opposition prepared talks on Poland's future.
   But the proposed talks have stalled and now the government and
opposition appear to be on a collision course over the scheduled
Dec. 1 closing of the shipyard.
   ``In a period when concrete decisions are being made about
reforms ... Lech Walesa has a different plan: Strike alert and
strikes. It happened before. The country does not need strike amok
but reconciliation.''
   A statement released Sunday by Solidarity's national executive
commission threatened broad protests, including strikes, if the
government does not rescind the shipyard decision.
   It was the strongest from Solidarity since Communist authorities
announced Oct. 31 that they intend to close the shipyard.
   On Saturday, Walesa said he would not meet with Interior Minister
Czeslaw Kiszczak to discuss plans for the talks unless the shipyard
decision is suspended and all workers fired for taking part in
strikes in August are rehired.
   Walesa aide Piotr Konopka said the Solidarity leader told
worshipers at St. Brygida's church in Gdansk Sunday that he would
call a national ``strike alert'' at a workers' rally scheduled
Tuesday in the Baltic port.
   ``If there is still great pressure on him from the side of the
shipyard and other enterprises as well, then on Tuesday he will
announce a strike alert for the whole country,'' said Konopka.
   A ``strike alert'' would mean organizing strike committees and
getting workers prepared to strike at any moment, said Solidarity
spokesman Wojciech Maziarski.
   The Solidarity statement denounced the decision to close the yard
as `a dangerous political act'' and ``an act of revenge against
Solidarity.''
   It said any closures should be preceded by a period of review of
economic performance, with workers and their representatives taking
part.
   Since promising Aug. 31 to meet with the opposition to discuss
legalization of Solidarity and how to revive Poland's limping
economy, the government has discouraged prospects by insisting that
Solidarity drop two alleged extremists from its delegation to the
talks.
   That condition, together with officials' decision to close the
shipyard and the failure to rehire at least 100 workers fired for
roles in the August strikes, has convinced Solidarity that the
government is no longer interested in talks.
   Solidarity, the only independent labor movement ever allowed in
the Soviet bloc, was born August 1980 during a nationwide strike
wave, crushed in a December 1981 military crackdown and outlawed the
following year.

   Detectives are using computers in an effort to
find a common denominator connecting more than 230 Antelope Valley
residents who have received highly personalized extortion letters.
   ``They tell them they're going to kill them. It's a `Pay up or
die, we're not messing around!' type of thing. They threaten their
children or other members of their family,'' said Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Sgt. Bob Welch.
   The letters, sent to doctors, dentists, lawyers and affluent
business people, demanded payments ranging from $500 to more than
$500,000, Welch said.
   The letters were so personal that the author is believed to have
intimate knowledge of the victims and their families.
   ``A lot of people have anxiety because of the personalized nature
of the letters,'' said Welch, who is part of a small task force
investigating the case.
   ``There was stuff in some of the letters that could almost be
classified as gossip,'' said Larry Grooms, city editor of the
Antelope Valley Press, which is offering a $10,000 reward. ``Some
goes back four or five years. In one instance, there was nickname a
guy had in high school.''
   Computers were being used in an effort to find a common thread of
clues that might link the victims to a suspect, Welch said. In
addition, he said, deputies were interviewing letter recipients to
see if their families, jobs or other outside activities might make
them targets of extortion.
   The letters were mailed Nov. 1 with a Mojave postmark and sent to
people in Lancaster, Palmdale and the unincorporated area of Quartz
Hill, Welch said.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan told fellow
Californians today their votes could be crucial in assuring ``a new
beginning for America'' by electing Republican George Bush as
president and staving off a late-hour drive by Democrat Michael
Dukakis.
   In a speech prepared for delivery at the Queen Mary, a former
luxury ocean liner converted to a waterfront hotel, the 77-year-old
president said he was returning to his home state at the end of the
Bush campaign just as he did in his own campaigns for the White
House.
   ``Today, of course, is the last day of this, my last campaign as
president,'' he said. ``But tomorrow launches a new beginning for
America.''
   ``Your votes tomorrow may be the most important ones cast in
America,'' the president said. ``They will determine how California
goes, and California may send the next president to the White
House.''
   California has 47 electoral votes as the most populous state.
   Reagan lavished praise on Bush, who has served under him for
nearly eight years as vice president.
   ``This year, one of the best qualified men to ever seek the
office of president is on the ballot,'' he said.
   Of Bush's personal qualities, Reagan said, ``He is strong,
decent, loyal, wise, capable and compassionate.''
   ``As for his opponent, we only really began to learn about him
during the last few months,'' the president said. ``He has been
vague as to what he would do in office, yet when we focus on his
record, he objects.''
   Reagan contended that the Democratic nominee ``is against
voluntary prayer in school ... appointed judges to his state Supreme
Court who have voted to strike down a ban on child pornography ...
and, in every case, even for the most brutal crimes, he opposes the
death penalty.''
   ``He's free to have these views, but is this the man we want
choosing the justices to sit on the Supreme Court of the United
States?'' he asked.
   The former movie actor recalled that it was from the Queen Mary,
then a British liner, that he first saw the Statue of Liberty on his
return from England, where he filmed ``The Hasty Heart.''
   ``This is my last campaign, and seeing all of you ... and seeing
the Queen Mary again, it's like closing a circle, like sailing into
harbor after a long and wonderful voyage to be greeted by old,
beloved friends,'' the president said.
   From Long Beach, Reagan, 77, headed to San Diego for a nostalgic
visit to the seaside city where he held his final campaign rally on
the eve of his landslide re-election in 1984.
   He was flying for 10 hours and 20 minutes during a roundtrip from
Washington just to make two speeches in three hours and five minutes
in his home state.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan will have
traveled about 25,000 miles and made 30 political appearances in 16
states for Bush since Labor Day, including today's trip.
   He said Reagan was making his first roundtrip to California in a
single day at the request of the Bush campaign because GOP polls say
the presidential contest is ``nip and tuck'' in the state.
   The former Hollywood movie star, who spent two terms in
Sacramento as governor, made seven earlier political appearances in
California during the current presidential campaign.
   He spoke in Long Beach and Irvine on Aug. 23, in Thousand Oaks
and Santa Barbara on Aug. 27, in San Diego on Oct. 27 and in
Fullerton and San Bernardino last Wednesday.
   San Diego is a prime target because the county is one of
California's most heavily Republican, with more registered GOP
voters than Democrats, although the Democrats hold a statewide
registration edge of 50.4 percent to 38.6 percent. San Bernardino
County also has more registered Republicans than Democrats, as does
Orange County, in which Irvine and Fullerton are located.
   The latest California Poll, conducted by Mervin Field and
released Thursday, gave Bush an 8-point edge among likely voters.
   However, an administration official traveling with Reagan on
Saturday, speaking on condition he not be identified, said more
recent Republican tracking polls showed that Bush's lead had
narrowed. Dukakis spokesmen said their polls showed the same thing.

<HEAD>Court To Study Case of Former Dallas Football Coach in Racial Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to study the
case of a former Dallas high school football coach who says he lost
his job because he is white.
   The court said it will hear competing appeals filed by Norman
Jett, longtime coach and athletic director at South Oak Cliff High
School in Dallas, and by the Dallas Independent School District.
   The justices will study a 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ruling that ordered a new trial for Jett's lawsuit against the city
school district and Frederick Todd, South Oak Cliff's principal.
   A federal jury had awarded Jett $850,000 in damages, reduced by a
federal trial judge to about $563,000.
   Jett had coached the South Oak Cliff football team since 1962
when, in the spring of 1983, he was transferred to another city high
school.
   Jett had been named head coach and athletic director at the
school in 1970, the year the racial composition at South Oak Cliff
changed from predominantly white to predominantly black.
   Todd, who is black, became the school's principal in 1975.
   According to the 5th Circuit court, tensions between Todd and
Jett were exasperated by events surrounding South Oak Cliff's loss
to Plano in the state high school championship game in November 1982.
   Jett's appeal said, ``Todd believed that South Oak Cliff would
have to recruit young black athletes at the junior high school level
and he evidently believed that a successful recruiter would have to
be black.''
   The appeal added that Todd ``decided to replace Jett with a black
coach.''
   Jett sued the school district and Todd over his transfer to a
teaching position at another school.
   His suit, filed under a much-used civil rights law, alleged that
school officials had violated his due-process, free-speech and
equal-protection rights.
   The jury ruled that the city school district should be held
legally liable for what it found to be violations of Jett's rights
but the appeals court ruled that the jury ``did not make sufficient
findings to support municipal liability.''
   The appeals court ordered a new trial for that reason.
   The issue to be studied by the justices is whether public
employees who claim racial discrimination must show that the bias
resulted from official ``policy or custom'' before recovering
damages from their employers.
   The cases are Jett vs. Dallas Independent School District,
87-2084, and Dallas Independent School District vs. Jett, 88-214.

<HEAD>Court Rules Huntington, N.Y., Officials Reinforced Racial
Segregation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today ruled that Huntington,
N.Y., officials reinforced racial segregation by confining housing
for low-income families to a predominantly non-white urban renewal
area.
   By a 6-3 vote, the justices upheld a ruling that could make it
easier to use a federal civil rights law to challenge community
zoning ordinances that limit low-cost housing.
   But the high court, in a four-page, unsigned opinion, declined to
answer the key question posed by the case: Does a zoning regulation
violate fair housing provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 when
there is evidence of discriminatory impact but not discriminatory
motives?
   City officials conceded originally that the ``disparate impact''
theory applied to the case, the justices said.
   ``We are satisfied on this record that disparate impact was
shown, and that the sole justification proferred to rebut (that
argument) was inadequate,'' the high court said. ``We do not reach
the question whether that test is the appropriate one.''
   Justices Byron R. White, Thurgood Marshall and John Paul Stevens
dissented. They voted to hear arguments in the case to explore the
issue.
   A federal appeals court said statistical studies showing a zoning
ordinance's discriminatory effects, even if unintentional, could
establish a violation of the 1968 law.
   The alternative approach _ supported by the Reagan administration
among others _ would require the more difficult task of proving the
zoning ordinance is intentionally biased.
   Administration lawyers supported the appeal by Huntington
officials.
   ``Congress intended to require a showing of intentional
discrimination'' when it passed the fair housing law, Justice
Department lawyers said.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last April that
Huntington's zoning ordinance perpetuated segregation by confining
to a predominantly black area subsidized apartments designed to
benefit poorer families.
   ``The disproportionate harm to blacks and the segregative impact
on the entire community resulting from the refusal to rezone create
a strong ... showing of discriminatory effect,'' the appeals court
said.
   The town failed to present ``bona fide and legitimate
justifications for its action'' or show there were ``no less
discriminatory alternatives available,'' the appeals court added.
   Another New York community _ Yonkers _ has been embroiled in a
fight over a court order to build low- and moderate-income housing.
In that case, the 2nd Circuit court ruled Yonkers acted unlawfully
by intentionally maintaining segregated housing and schools.
   Huntington, a Long Island community of some 200,000 residents,
has a black population of less than 3.5 percent. Most blacks live in
two neighborhoods.
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
along with a local group called Housing Help Inc., sued the town in
1981 for its refusal to approve multi-family dwellings on a
14.8-acre site in Greenlawn, a predominantly white hamlet of
single-family houses.
   Housing Help Inc. proposed to build 162 federally subsidized
low-income apartments there.
   A federal judge ruled that Huntington's zoning ordinance did not
violate the 1968 federal civil rights act.
   Huntington officials noted that the town has 775 low-income
housing units and said the town has done its fair share in
developing subsidized dwellings.
   But the 2nd Circuit court said confining such apartments to the
urban renewal area has a disproportionate impact on blacks.
   While the appeals court acknowledged there are more poor whites
than blacks in the community, it noted that only 7 percent of all
Huntington families needed subsidized housing while 24 percent of
black families needed such help.
   Placing low-income housing in predominantly white Greenlawn will
promote integration, the 2nd Circuit court said.
   The appeals court said it took the extraordinary step of ordering
Huntington to approve the proposed 162-unit project because
``further delay might well prove fatal'' to the plan.
   The case is Huntington vs. NAACP, 87-1961.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Appeal by North Dakota Couple on Educating Son at
Home</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal by a
North Dakota couple charged with truancy for educating their son at
home in accord with their religious principles.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that reinstated
the charges.
   Jonathan Melin, pastor of the Faith Baptist Church in Oakes,
N.D., and his wife, Diana, were accused of failing to send their
son, Teddy, to public school as required by state law.
   The Melins, who have bachelor's degrees, said they are qualified
to teach Teddy at home.
   North Dakota law requires that children attend public school or
be taught by a state-certified teacher. The Melins, who do not have
such certification, said North Dakota is the only state that has an
absolute requirement that home-school teachers be certified.
   A state judge in 1987 threw out the truancy charges against the
Melins on grounds the teacher certification requirement violated
their constitutionally protected right to exercise their religion
freely.
   But the North Dakota Supreme Court reinstated the charges last
July.
   The state court said reviving the case would not violate the
Melins' protection against double jeopardy _ being prosecuted twice
for the same alleged offense.
   The judge who dismissed the case did not acquit them, the state
court said.
   Double jeopardy ``occurs only when the trial court has resolved
some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged,'' the
state court said.
   The state court also rejected the Melins' argument that requiring
them to be state-certified is not the least restrictive means of
enforcing the state's compelling interest in the education of
children.
   ``We continue to believe the state has compelling interest in
ensuring that when public or non-public education occurs that it is
conducted by persons who are knowledgeable and who are able to
impart that knowledge in a manner conducive to a child's
education,'' the state court said.
   Requiring teachers to be certified by the state furthers that
goal, it added.
   The case is Melin vs. North Dakota, 88-470.

<HEAD>Winnie Mandela Visits Husband Amid Speculation of Release</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Winnie Mandela today paid a
hospital visit to her husband, African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela. The government denied media speculation that he or
his colleagues would be released.
   Several South African newspapers have been quoting government
sources for the past week as saying Mandela would be released before
the end of the year from his life prison sentence. He was imprisoned
in 1962.
   The Prisons Service and other government sources emphatically
denied that either Mandela or any of the other five men imprisoned
with him for plotting to overthrow the government would be released
today. The officials would not comment on the possibility of
releases at a future date.
   Mrs. Mandela's visit lasted 45 minutes and was described by Cape
Town attorney Essa Moosa as normal.
   Moosa and the Rev. Allan Boesak, president of the World Alliance
of Reformed Churches, accompanied Mrs. Mandela.
   Boesak, an anti-apartheid activist, said there was ``no
indication (Mandela) would be released today or in the near future.''
   One government source indicated his belief that the rumors
circulating today were being orchestrated by members of the
anti-apartheid movement to pressure the government into taking some
action.
   The rumors have been building since August, when the 70-year-old
Mandela was transferred from Pollsmoor Prison to a Cape Town
hospital for treatment of tuberculosis. He was later transferred to
the private Constantiaberg Clinic, where doctors say he has
recovered.
   President P.W. Botha said he hoped it would be possible not to
send Mandela back to prison.
   Mandela has rejected Botha's offers to release him in exchange
for a renunciation of violence, saying the government must make a
similar renunciation and lift restrictions on black political
activity.
   In addition to Mandela, African National Congress
Secretary-General Walter Sisulu and four lesser known ANC members
are still in prison from the 1964 trial.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<TEXT>
   The two German nations today recalled the ``fascist
racial madness'' of Kristallnacht, the night a half-century ago that
signaled the start of the systematic Nazi campaign to annihilate
Jews.
   Towns and cities in the East and the West have begun paying
tribute to the victims of the night of Nov. 9, 1938, when Nazi
sympathizers looted and burned Jewish temples and businesses,
beating and killing scores of Jews and sending 30,000 of them to
concentration camps.
   The rampage became known as Kristallnacht _ or ``Crystal Night''
_ because of the shards of broken glass that filled the streets.
   Josef Foschepoth, the general secretary of West Germany's
Societies for Christian-Jewish Cooperation, said the night marked
``the start of a new phase, the phase of the physical annihilation
of the Jews.''
   This week, hundreds of gatherings, panel discussions and
ceremonies will mark the 50th anniversary Wednesday of what the West
German news agency ADN called a night of ``fascist racial madness.''
   In the East German city of Leipzig, officials and members of the
Jewish community today paid tribute to the victims by laying wreaths
at the site of the synagogue that was destroyed and at the city's
Jewish cemetery.
   Peter Kirchner, the head of East Germany's tiny Jewish community,
said his nation _ which has emphasized how communists as well as
Jews were persecuted by the Nazis _ appears to be learning more from
the lessons of the past than neighboring West Germany.
   ``In (East Germany), there's a greater cracking down on
neo-fascist ways of thought than in (West Germany), where meetings
of former Nazis can take place under police protection,'' Kirchner
said Sunday in an interview on West Germany's Deutschlandfunk radio.
   The city of Potsdam just outside Berlin has organized an exhibit
about Jewish life during the Nazi era, which includes ``shocking,
original fascist documents in which an expulsion order and the
stripping of (German) citizenship are communicated to Jews,''
according to the news agency.
   Residents of Koenigstein, a West German town of 16,500 near
Frankfurt, on Sunday placed a wreath at the site where the synagogue
was burned down on Nov. 10, 1938.
   West Germany's Bundestag, or parliament, will hold a solemn
ceremony on Thursday.
   In the city of Darmstadt, about 25 miles south of Frankfurt, a
new synagogue will be dedicated Wednesday.
   The number of deaths on Kristallnacht remains uncertain. At least
195 synagogues and about 7,500 Jewish businesses were either
destroyed or badly damaged. Some estimates put the number of
vandalized synagogues at more than 1,100.
   ``Throughout (Germany) that night, 91 Jews met their death under
the sticks, boots and bullets of the death squads of the Nazi
movement,'' Foschepoth told 125 residents of Koenigstein on Sunday.
``How was all this possible?''
   During their rule from 1933 to 1945, the Nazis murdered an
estimated 6 million Jews.
   West Germany has paid the equivalent of $44 billion, at today's
currency exchange rates, in compensation to Holocaust victims and
their survivors.
   There are about 32,000 Jews living in West Germany, while the
number of practicing Jews in East Germany is estimated to be between
450 and 600.

<HEAD>Doctor Ordered To Continue Dialysis For Unwanted Patient</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A kidney specialist has been ordered
to provide dialysis for another week to a woman refused the
life-giving treatment by more than a dozen other doctors.
   But a temporary restraining order issued Friday also said Jeanie
Joshua of Ojai must go elsewhere for treatment after the order
expires Friday.
   The UCLA Medical Center has accepted her for dialysis, but Ms.
Joshua said the 80-mile trip three days a week would be impossible
for her in her weakened condition.
   ``This is going to be a slow death. There's no way I can
withstand it,'' said Ms. Joshua. A friend now drives her 40 miles to
Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara.
   Ms. Joshua, 38, claims kidney specialists from Santa Barbara to
Simi Valley have refused to treat her because of her 1986 lawsuit
against a Santa Barbara specialist that contends impure water was
used in the blood-purifying dialysis procedure. The suit is pending.
   Her current physician, Dr. David W. Doner Jr., told the Los
Angeles Times he was dropping Ms. Joshua because she was too
aggressive in directing her medical treatment and because he could
not find another specialist to see her if he needed to leave town.
   Ms. Joshua described herself as an assertive patient who
sometimes refuses to take tests or treatments she disagrees with.
   Three medical groups representing 11 doctors in southern Santa
Barbara and Ventura counties have refused to see her, she said.
   Doner has a legal right to drop the woman as a patient, his
lawyer said. ``It's well-established law that a physician may select
which patients he cares for,'' said Harold M. Haider.
   The few court cases on the issue have generally upheld a doctor's
right to drop a patient or refuse to accept someone as a new
patient, said Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical
Ethics at the University of Minnesota.
   But arrangements have usually been made to provide
life-sustaining treatment even to combative or abusive patients, he
said.
   ``There are cases where patients have been dialyzed while
shackled to a bed or with an armed guard present,'' Caplan said.
``You can't just be abandoned in a life-and-death situation.''

   A truck driver has been arrested in New York
City and charged with second-degree murder in the death of his
girlfriend, whose body was found in an Iowa drainage ditch after a
six-week search.
   Charles Houser, 32, of Omaha, was arrested without incident
Saturday night after he arrived in Manhattan with a truckload of
meat, according to a statement issued by Omaha police Lt. Larry
Roberts.
   The body of Janice Ross-Patterson, 34, a North High School
secretary, was found that morning along a drainage ditch near Neola,
Iowa, about 20 miles from Omaha. An autopsy performed Sunday
confirmed the identity, the police statement said.
   Ms. Ross-Patterson was reported missing after she failed to
arrive at North High for work Sept. 27. Police said early in the
investigation that Houser was the last person known to have seen
her. Her car was found in a grocery store parking lot.
   According to Roberts' statement, the autopsy found that Ms.
Ross-Patterson was killed by several blows to the head with a blunt
object.
   Her body was found about 100 feet from where a man from the Neola
area reported that he saw the missing woman's car Sept. 27. The
Neola man told police that a man, later identified as Houser, had
come to his home asking for help in pulling his car from a ditch.
   Ms. Ross-Patterson's body was found by the sixth weekend search
by relatives and volunteers. About 120 people joined the search
Saturday.
   Recent frost had reduced weed cover, allowing searchers to locate
the body, the police statement said.

   Typhoon Skip lashed central Philippine
islands today with 108 mph winds and torrential rains, causing
floods and mudslides that forced thousands of people to flee their
homes.
   Damage and casualty reports were sketchy because of poor
communications to the affected area. Radio station DZGE in Naga
reported 10 people, six of them children, were killed today in a
mudslide near the city, about 210 miles southeast of Manila.
   There was no official confirmation of the report.
   The Department of Social Services said about 200,000 people had
been ``affected'' by Skip, the second typhoon to hit the Philippines
in two weeks.
   Most of them were on Leyte Island, which was without electricity
after Skip blew down power lines, the department said.
   The storm came ashore early today on Samar Island, about 410
miles southeast of Manila, and was heading northwest at 13.6 mph,
the government weather service said. Its stiff winds and high waves
sank a freighter in port.
   Storm warnings were announced for Samar, Leyte, Mindanao and
other islands in the central Visayas chain, as well as Manila and
several Luzon provinces.
   The weather service predicted winds up to 60 mph would lash those
areas. Residents of coastal areas were advised to move to higher
ground and small craft were ordered to remain in port.
   The storm was expected to pass about 75 miles south of Manila
early Tuesday. Forecasters said Manila could expect strong winds and
rains but predicted less damage in the capital than during Typhoon
Ruby two weeks ago.
   Philippine Airlines canceled at least 35 domestic flights today
as the storm approached. The coast guard suspended all passenger
ship service to ports in the Visayas Islands Sunday, stranding
thousands of passengers in Manila and other major ports.
   Heavy rains triggered by Typhoon Skip unleashed landslides on the
slopes of the Mayon volcano, about 200 miles southeast of Manila on
Luzon's Bicol peninsula, the government-run Philippines News Agency
said.
   It said hundreds of families were isolated by the slides, but
there were no reports of fatalities. It quoted local officials as
saying about 2,600 people had been evacuated from the slopes of
Mayon, the country's most famous volcano.
   The coast guard said a freighter, the Sea Runner, sank in port on
Bohol Island early today after being buffeted by strong winds and
heavy waves from Skip. All 17 crewmen escaped, the coast guard said,
but the ship's cargo of 11,250 bags of cement was lost.
   The Office of Civil Defense said 14 of the 16 towns in Capiz
province, 250 miles southeast of Manila, were flooded today and that
hundreds of families were being evacuated to schools and churches.
   Typhoon Skip struck as this archipelago nation was still reeling
from the effects of Typhoon Ruby, which hit the country Oct. 24, and
tropical storm Tess, which swept through the Visayas Islands
Saturday.
   Officials said Ruby killed at least 181 people on land. At least
64 others were killed and more than 200 others are missing from the
passenger ship Dona Marilyn, which sank about 300 miles southeast of
Manila during the typhoon.
   On Saturday, Lake Laguna on the southeastern edge of Manila
overflowed its banks and more than 3,000 people fled their homes.
Officials said the water level in the lake was about 5{ feet above
normal because of heavy rains that struck in the wake of Ruby.
   Skip was the 20th typhoon or tropical storms to strike the
Philippines this year.

   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether the government may confiscate from criminal defendants money
and property that could be used to pay their legal fees.
   The court announced it will review cases stemming from federal
prosecutions of drug dealers in New York and Virginia.
   The justices thus set the stage for an important ruling on the
rights of the accused and the government's power to fight crime by
seizing illicit criminal proceeds. Their decision is expected in
1989.
   In one case, the law firm of Caplin & Drysdale here was denied
$170,000 in legal fees for representing Christopher Reckmeyer. He
pleaded guilty in 1985 in Virginia to charges stemming from what
prosecutors said was his role as kingpin of a multi-million-dollar
drug operation.
   Reckmeyer was sentenced to 17 years in prison and was ordered to
forfeit all proceeds from the drug deals. The seizure of the money
left him without funds to pay Caplin & Drysdale.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last January that
Reckmeyer is not entitled to use any of the money to reimburse the
law firm.
   In the second case, the Reagan administration appealed a ruling
that allows Peter Monsanto access to assets worth $400,000 to help
him pay his lawyers.
   Monsanto was convicted in New York City of charges he headed a
heroin-selling ring.
   The jury also ordered him to forfeit to the government a house in
Mount Vernon, N.Y., valued at $335,000, a $30,000 cooperative
apartment in the Bronx and $35,000 in cash.
   But the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in July he could
use the assets to pay legitimate legal fees incurred in his defense.
   At issue are forfeiture provisions of key federal crime-fighting
laws, including the Continuing Criminal Enterprise Act and the
Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations statute.
   The 4th Circuit court ruled in Reckmeyer's case that the
constitutional right of the accused to be represented by a lawyer
does not entitle the defendant to an attorney of his choice.
   ``The right to counsel of choice belongs only to those with
legitimate assets,'' the appeals court said in a 7-4 decision. ``The
right to counsel does not guarantee that every defendant will have
the lawyer he desires.''
   Caplin & Drysdale, and other attorneys, argue that confiscating
the assets of people when they are indicted will leave them too poor
to pay their own lawyers.
   The 4th Circuit court, and the Reagan administration, said those
defendants will still be represented by court-appointed attorneys.
   The appeals court used the example of a robber caught with
$100,000 taken from a bank.
   ``Surely no one will contend that the $100,000 must be made
available to pay the defendant's lawyer and not be kept available
for return to the bank in the event the defendant is found guilty,''
the 4th Circuit court said.
   But the 2nd Circuit appeals court, in an 8-4 decision, said
Monsanto is entitled to use his assets to pay his lawyer.
   The 2nd Circuit ruling produced eight opinions, including three
by those in the majority who ruled in Monsanto's favor.
   One opinion favoring Monsanto that was signed by three judges
said, ``The government must prove that an accused is guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt. It must do this by obtaining convincing evidence
of the defendant's guilt, not by preventing the defendant from
retaining counsel of choice.''
   In other action, the court:
   _ Agreed to decide a recurring copyright question by reviewing a
dispute over a sculpture depicting the plight of the homeless
commissioned by the Community for Creative Non-Violence.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by the group and its
founder, Mitch Snyder, who seek exclusive copyright ownership of the
work.
   _ Refused to reinstate an unusual racial quota system designed to
prevent ``white flight'' from the nation's largest publicly assisted
housing development.
   The court, with one dissenting vote, let stand a ruling that the
racial distribution of apartments at the middle-income Starrett City
development in Brooklyn, N.Y., violates the federal Fair Housing Act.
   _ Rejected an appeal by a company challenging federal guidelines
for controlling and removing asbestos in school buildings.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the
regulations are reasonable.
   _ Rejected a free-press challenge to a judge's order that barred
participants in the criminal trial of former Rep. Mario Biaggi,
D-N.Y., from talking to news reporters.
   The court, over three dissenting votes, turned away arguments
that the ``gag order'' a federal judge imposed during the
since-completed Wedtech Corp. corruption trial was an unlawful prior
restraint.
   _ Let stand a ruling a that barred television and still cameras
and radio broadcasting equipment from a trial of the late Teamsters
President Jackie Presser and two others.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by media
representatives in Cleveland who said banning broadcast and
photographic coverage of an important union corruption case violates
the Constitution's free-press guarantees.
   _ Agreed to study the case of a former Dallas high school
football coach who says he lost his job because he is white.
   The court said it will hear competing appeals filed by Norman
Jett, longtime coach and athletic director at South Oak Cliff High
School in Dallas, and by the Dallas Independent School District.
   _ Ruled that Huntington, N.Y., officials reinforced racial
segregation by confining housing for low-income families to a
predominantly non-white urban renewal area.
   The forfeiture cases are Caplin & Drysdale vs. U.S., 87-1729, and
U.S. vs. Monsanto, 88-454.

   Nearly a thousand officers from around
the Northeast marched today in the funeral procession of a police
cadet who collapsed during a rigorous training program.
   Timothy Shepard, 25, underwent a liver transplant a week after he
fell ill on a running track at the state-run police academy in
Agawam, near Springfield.
   He lapsed into a coma for two weeks, emerged, then lost
consciousness last Monday. He died Wednesday at a Pittsburgh
hospital. His death and the hospitalization of several other cadets
has prompted a re-examination of the state's police training
programs.
   ``Despite his pain, despite his suffering, his wracked body
hooked to machines, he smiled and he shed the light of his life on
all of us,'' the Rev. Peter Gregory, a family friend and chaplain at
Mercy Hospital in Springfield, said in his homily. ``God was with
him in a special way.''
   Scores of Pittsfield officers led the 150-cruiser procession to
St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church, followed by police on
motorcycles and horseback, color guards from 50 departments in all
six New England states and New York, and members of the Pittsfield
Boys' Club. Shepard had been named the club's Youth of the Year in
1981.
   After the funeral, the procession was to head to St. Joseph's
Cemetery, a half-mile away, for burial.
   Lines outside the 1,500-seat church began forming more than an
hour before the funeral, and loudspeakers were hung outside the
building.
   Among the mourners were state police troopers from western
Massachusetts and the 46 cadets still training at Agawam. State
police said they scaled back their presence at the funeral from six
cruisers of troopers after Shepard's family initially asked that
state police not attend at all. They withdrew the request Sunday,
according to Pittsfield Mayor Anne Everest Wojtkowski.
   More than 2,000 people turned out for Shepard's wake Saturday and
Sunday. The police department's teletype machine has received
messages of condolence from all over the Northeast and even from as
far south as Delaware, said Lt. Gerald Lee.
   The last Pittsfield officer to die in the line of duty was killed
in 1898 while pushing a woman and her child to safety off the tracks
of an oncoming train.
   Shepard was one of 16 cadets hospitalized in the first week of
training. The illness prompted at least three state investigations
and resulted in the resignation of the head of the state's police
training program.
   An autopsy Friday indicated Shepard died from infections that set
in because of his weakened condition from training and a liver
transplant.
   Shepard had collapsed from heat stroke Sept. 19 at the end of the
grueling first day of training. Other cadets reported that they were
put through a strenuous regimen for hours on just a few cups of
water.
   Shepard's death will be the subject of an inquest to determine
whether criminal charges should be brought against the state
troopers in charge of training.
   A month-long investigation into the illnesses found a ``massive
failure'' of the system that led to abusive training.

<HEAD>Emergency Rooms Seeing Many More Drug Cases: Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hospital emergency room admissions for
incidents involving cocaine and other drugs have grown dramatically,
according to excerpts from a federal report released today by Rep.
Charles B. Rangel, D-N.Y.
   The report, prepared by the National Institute on Drug Abuse,
compares changes from 1986 to 1987.
   Among the findings:
   _Emergency room admissions for cocaine-related cases increased
185 percent in Philadelphia; 108 percent in Phoenix, Ariz.; 74
percent in Chicago; 158 percent in Buffalo, N.Y.; 39 percent in New
York; 100 percent in Texas, and 122 percent in the District of
Columbia.
   _Cocaine has become so available that prices are dropping in most
cities including Atlanta, Buffalo, Chicago, Detroit and Miami.
   _Heroin-related emergency room admissions were up 37 percent in
the District of Columbia, 51 percent in Newark, N.J.; 45 percent in
Seattle; 60 percent in St. Louis, and 486 percent in New Orleans.
   _Admissions for marijuana-related cases were up 165 percent in
the District of Columbia, 100 percent in Newark, 53 percent in New
Orleans, 69 percent in Seattle, 100 percent in Texas and 316 percent
in Phoenix.
   Rangel, who released key findings of a similar study last year,
again criticized the Department of Health and Human Services for
what he described as its ``failure to widely disseminate this
extremely significant data, which clearly demonstrate the failure of
the administration's anti-drug policies to stem an expanding drug
crisis that afflicts our nation's urban centers.''

<TEXT>
   Former Beatles drummer Ringo Starr and his wife,
actress Barbara Bach, are being treated for alcoholism at an
American clinic, his former press officer said today.
   Derek Taylor, the Beatles' press agent for six years, said the
couple had undergone four weeks of an eight-week program at the
unidentified clinic in the United States. Taylor's comments could
not be independently confirmed.
   He said Starr telephoned his London office from the United States
to announce the couple's admission to the clinic.
   ``The message he left was: `We are doing fine, we are very well
and we are in recovery','' Taylor said.
   ``Ringo wanted this to go public because it was already seeping
out through fellow guests at the clinic,'' he said. ``I got the call
from Ringo's London office to put out a statement saying he wished
it to be known he is a recovering alcoholic.''
   Taylor said the location of the clinic was being kept secret but
added: ``It is not in Los Angeles or New York.''
   Starr, 48, and Miss Bach, 39, were receiving treatment for their
addiction ``as equal members of a larger group,'' he said.
   Taylor said he had known Starr for 25 years and last saw him at a
party six weeks ago, but had not known him to be an alcoholic.
   The Beatles _ John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and
Starr _ broke up in 1970. Lennon was murdered in New York in 1980.

<BYLINE>Court Refuses to Reinstate Racial Quota System at New York Housing
Development
^By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to reinstate an
unusual racial quota system designed to prevent ``white flight''
from the nation's largest publicly assisted housing development.
   The court, with one dissenting vote, let stand a ruling that the
racial distribution of apartments at the middle-income Starrett City
development in Brooklyn, N.Y., violates the federal Fair Housing Act.
   Justice Byron R. White voted to hear arguments in the case. But
at least four votes are required to grant such review.
   The owners of Starrett City said they tried to preserve
integration at the development by allocating 64 percent of the
apartments to whites, 22 percent to blacks and 8 percent to
Hispanics. The remaining apartments were for Orientals and other
minorities.
   Starrett City _ with 46 high-rise buildings, 5,881 apartments and
more than 17,000 people _ receives state and federal financial
assistance and tax breaks from New York City.
   The quota system has meant that blacks and Hispanics seeking
apartments in Starrett City have spent long periods on the waiting
list.
   A group of black applicants filed a federal suit in 1979
challenging the quotas.
   The suit was settled in 1984 with the owners agreeing to provide
an additional 175 apartments over five years for blacks and other
minority applicants.
   The federal government then filed its own suit a month after the
settlement, alleging the quotas violate the anti-discrimination Fair
Housing Act of 1968.
   The Reagan administration said it is illegal to impose quotas
that hurt minority applicants, even if the purpose is to maintain a
system of racial balance that will discourage whites from fleeing.
   The system denies blacks and Hispanics the freedom ``to live
where income permits,'' the Reagan administration said.
   Arguing that the housing complex will become predominantly black
and Hispanic if quotas are not maintained ``blatantly caters to
white prejudice,'' the Justice Department said.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 2-1 ruling last
March, agreed with the government.
   The Fair Housing Act does not permit ``rigid racial quotas of
indefinite duration to maintain a fixed level of integration at
Starrett City by restricting minority access to scarce and desirable
rental accommodations,'' the appeals court said.
   Judge Jon O. Newman, in a dissenting opinion on the appeals
court, said he was convinced abandoning the quotas would produce
white flight. ``The Fair Housing Act does not require this tragedy
to occur,'' he said.
   The owners of Starrett City were supported in their appeal to the
Supreme Court by the development's tenants association.
   ``The successful 15-year experiment at the nation's largest
federally assisted housing development is in jeopardy,'' the
association said.
   The case is vs. Starrett City vs. U.S., 88-82.

   George Bush and Michael Dukakis talked confidently of fast
finishes today as they crossed paths in battleground states on the
final day before Americans choose a new president. Underdog Dukakis
promised ``a November surprise,'' while Bush declared he was
finishing ``not in a power walk but in a sprint.''
   Like Dukakis, Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen
was racing through key states. In addition to several stops in his
home base of Texas, Bentsen was slated to campaign in Louisiana,
Arkansas and Missouri.
   Bentsen appeared in Dallas with a caged quail at his side and
drew hoots from a crowd when he asked, ``How do you like the idea of
George Bush as president and Dan Quayle standing in the wings?''
   The GOP vice presidential nominee campaigned in Maryland and in
safely Republican Virginia as well as Indiana, his home state.
   The latest polls bolstered the vice president's optimism as he
followed his Democratic rival into Ohio and roared toward St. Louis.
   At a sunrise rally in a steelworkers union hall outside
Cleveland, Dukakis was in high spirits after snatching a two-hour
nap on an overnight flight from the West Coast.
   `Good Morning, Ohio,'' he said. ``We took the red-eye to be with
the Buckeyes.''
   ``I don't need sleep, I'm charging,'' he said. ``We're going to
win.''
   Bush began his day in the Detroit suburb of Southfield, Mich.,
and took a jab at Dukakis' fondness for exercising by walking
rapidly while carrying weights.
   The vice president said the race in Michigan was close and ``it's
a very important place to be as we run right down to the finish
line, not in a power walk but in a sprint.''
   Bush said that when Americans vote they should ask themselves
this question: ``Is the country headed in the right direction? The
answer is, yes it is.''
   From Michigan, Bush was headed for rallies in Ohio, Missouri and
Texas, where he maintains his voting residence.
   Dukakis preceded Bush into St. Louis by a couple of hours and
told his audience, ``This is the `show me' state, and I'm here to
show you how much I want your support,'' he said.
   Then, in a reference to Bush's summer home in Maine, Dukakis
asked, ``Are you going to let the pollsters and pundits decide this
election, or are you going to send a message that can be heard from
California to Kennebunkport?''
   ``They talk a lot about October surprises in an election
campaign,'' he told supporters. ``Tomorrow we're going to have a
November surprise.''
   ``The race is very, very tight. It's getting tighter by the
hour,'' Dukakis said.
   President Reagan was spending the day campaigning for Bush in
California.
   Both camps bombarded voters with 30-second commercials and the
two candidates were the stars of 30-minute prime time election eve
programs running back-to-back on ABC, CBS and NBC.
   The Bush campaign unleashed a final attack ad _ a five-minute
television commercial that summed up all the earlier attacks on
Dukakis' record.
   ``It's running in selected markets. It's a broad overview of
everything that Michael Dukakis stands for, according to his
record,'' Bush ad director Sig Rogich said.
   The ad features Massachusetts residents and officials complaining
about Dukakis' handling of pollution in Boston Harbor, the state's
prisoner furlough program and the state's economy, including taxes,
jobs and budget shortfalls. Bush does not appear.
   A rush of late national polls said the Republican vice president
was leading by margins ranging from five to 12 percentage points.
   A 50-state, ABC News-Washington Post poll of 7,777 likely voters
said Bush was solidly favored or leading in states with enough
electoral votes to assure his election.
   An Associated Press state-by-state survey said Bush was leading
in states with 356 electoral votes _ 86 more than the 270 needed for
a majority _ while Dukakis was ahead in states with a total of 101
electoral votes. Another 81 were in tossup states that included
Pennsylvania, Illinois and Missouri.
   Among the new polls, Gallup put Bush ahead by 12 percentage
points, while USA Today-CNN made it 11. ABC set the margin at 10 and
CBS said the difference was nine points. An NBC News-Wall Street
Journal poll and another by Louis Harris and Associates said the
margin for the vice president was five points with enough people
undecided or wavering to allow for dramatic last-minute changes.
   The presidential candidates weren't the only ones winding up
their campaigns.
   There were 33 Senate seats and the entire House being filled on
Tuesday and 12 states were electing governors.
   Democratic control of the Senate and House appeared secure and
the Democrats appeared likely to add to the 27 to 23 edge they now
have among governors.
   Thousands of other offices were being filled and scores of
initiatives also were on ballots, including 39 in California on
which opposing sides spent more than $100 million.
   Dukakis began a marathon race around the country late Sunday
flying from Spokane, Wash., to Cleveland, with a dawn arrival in the
Ohio city. From Cleveland he was heading for St. Louis and then on
to San Francisco.
   Aides were considering another 1,000-mile detour from San
Francisco before addressing a rally in Los Angeles. Then it was on
to a pre-dawn Election Day rally in Des Moines, Iowa, and a stop in
New Jersey or Ohio before ending the campaign back home in Boston.
   Whatever sleep he got would be in a tourist class seat on his
campaign plane.
   Bush told a celebrity-studded rally in Southern California that
Dukakis was putting up ``a last minute smokescreen ... So now all
that's left is this daily whining about a negative campaign. ...
Don't listen to the crying on the far left.''

   State police stopped a car for speeding
and discovered 1,100 pounds of cocaine valued at more than $70
million, authorities said.
   The cocaine was in cardboard boxes on the rear seat of a car
stopped Sunday on Interstate 44 on the east edge of Springfield, the
State Highway Patrol said.
   Patrol spokesman Sam Kaunley said the cache had a wholesale value
of $70 million, but he could not estimate its street value.
   James D. McCarnes and Willie G. Childress, two Los Angeles men
who were in the car, were arraigned Monday on charges of
transportation and possession of cocaine, according to the Greene
County court clerk.
   In 1986 at Miami, officials found 6,237 pounds of cocaine behind
a false wall of a cargo container aboard a Venezuelan freighter. And
in 1982, 3,243.2 pounds of cocaine were seized at the Miami airport.

   Five deer that apparently were panicked by
hunters died after leaping off a New York Thruway bridge and landing
on the pavement of a highway 30 feet below.
   Four deer died immediately Sunday and had broken backs, said Ward
Stone, a New York state wildlife pathologist. A fifth deer suffering
internal injuries and a broken leg was shot by a police officer.
   Two other deer managed to escape into the surrounding forest in
the Albany area, but Stone said they probably suffered serious
injuries.
   ``If they had landed on soft earth, it would have been a whole

   Stone said he expects such incidents to become more common as
suburbs encroached upon rural, wooded areas. ``I think society is
going to have this kind of problem increasingly,'' Stone said.

   The fifth slaying of a cabdriver this year in
Philadelphia has made cabbies wary about whom they pick up, where
they go and when they work.
   ``I don't cruise the streets,'' said Napoleon Conner, 43, a
five-year veteran. ``You find out the drug places; you don't go
there.''
   William Jones, 47, was stabbed by a passenger six times in the
head and chest early Sunday and left to die behind his steering
wheel in north Philadelphia, police said.
   Officer William Eiler heard brakes screeching and a crash, then
saw that the taxi had jumped a curb and stopped under a railroad
bridge, homicide Detective Sgt. Dennis Murray said.
   The passenger jumped out and yelled at Eiler, ``He tried to rob
me,'' before the officer lost him in the darkness, Murray said. A
bloody knife was found in the cab, police said.
   No arrest had been made Monday, said Detective Edward Tenuto.
   The state Public Utility Commission, which regulates taxis, does
not require the city's 1,532 licensed cabs to have bullet-resistant
shields separating the front and back seats to protect the drivers,
said Bernard Axelrod, a former cabdriver and a board member of the
United Cab Association. The shields are required in several cities,
including New York, Detroit and Boston.
   ``I know a lot of people are scared. I'm scared myself,'' said
Reginald Chukwurah, 26, who has been robbed once since he began
driving cabs in December. He said he no longer drives at night and
just looks for fares at hotels, train stations and airports.
   He only picks up people on the street if they are office workers,
couples or people with children.
   ``If it was just a single person just walking, I wouldn't pick
them up, regardless if they were white or black or whatever they
were,'' said Chukwurah, who is black.
   Even so, the man who robbed him was dressed up and carrying a
briefcase, he said.
   Albert Wilson, 57, who said he has driven a cab for about a year,
said he refuses to take people to housing projects.
   ``They might take you to a project and there might be people
waiting on you to rob you and maybe steal the cab, the radio, the
meter,'' he said.
   Two people have been charged with murder in the Sept. 18 death of
a cabbie who was found with a bullet wound in the back of his head.
   One man has been charged with murder and robbery in the July 24
death of a cabbie whose body was found riddled with bullets.
   No one has been arrested in the deaths of a cabbie shot in the
head on June 26, or of one who was stabbed Feb. 2 and staggered
along a street knocking on doors for help before collapsing.

<TEXT>
   After a year-long presidential campaign, how
long will Americans have to wait Tuesday night to find out who won?
Four states where the polls close early could provide the answer.
   The winner could be known early if Republican George Bush is
making a strong showing.
   But if Democrat Michael Dukakis is doing well, it could be a long
night with the result hanging on returns from the West Coast.
   The four states cited by election analyst William Schneider of
the American Enterprise Institute are Connecticut, Kentucky, Ohio
and Vermont.
   ``If Dukakis wins Vermont and Connecticut, it's good news for the
Democrats,'' said Schneider. ``Keep tuned. If Dukakis wins Kentucky
and Ohio, it's very good news for the Democrats.''
   On the other hand, he said, ``If Bush wins all of those states,
it ought to be a good night for him.''
   Of those four states, Ohio has been targeted by both Bush and
Dukakis. Both candidates campaigned there Monday, the last of
several trips they've made to woo Ohio voters.
   In addition, they've poured a lot of money into advertising and
direct mail aimed at Buckeye voters.
   Most polls said Bush was leading in Ohio, but Dukakis was
insisting the margin was closing rapidly.
   All that attention makes Ohio a pretty good barometer of which
candidate's appeal got through best to voters.
   Dukakis campaign spokesman Leslie Dach said, ``We'll be looking
clearly at places like Vermont and Connecticut. ... We'd like to
win, which we think would be a strong signal for us.''
   He also cited the big Midwest industrial states, and then ``as we
head further out, Colorado, Montana and South Dakota'' are states
where the Democrat hopes to show strength.
   Another extremely important state where the polls close early and
the vote is tabulated fairly quickly is Illinois.
   The results from Chicago should indicate how successful Dukakis
was at persuading blacks to get out and vote for him. A large black
turnout in Chicago is essential for a Democrat to overcome
Republican majorities in the city's suburbs and elsewhere in the
state.
   If Dukakis doesn't get that majority, it would indicate he's
probably in trouble wherever black turnout is a factor.
   Other states to watch _ for various reasons _ are Massachusetts,
New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and West Virginia.
   Massachusetts should be safe for Dukakis. But if the outcome is
closer than expected it could be a sign of trouble for the
Massachusetts governor.
   The same is true for Rhode Island, also considered part of
Dukakis' base, but a state where some polls have said the race was
closer than expected.
   The flip side is New Jersey which is considered reliably in the
Bush column. Should Dukakis pull an upset or even come close, it
would indicate he could be headed for an upset.
   New York was considered part of Dukakis' base early in the
campaign, but more recent polls said the contest for the state's 36
electoral votes had narrowed considerably.
   Hard times and a Democratic tradition made West Virginia look
like a natural for Dukakis' populist campaign rhetoric. A Bush
victory in the state would signal a bad night for the Democrats.

   Police on the Kenai Peninsula are
keeping an eye peeled for the one that got away, and by all accounts
it's a real whopper.
   The Alaska state troopers said a thief or thieves swiped a
14-foot-long king salmon made of plastic foam and fiberglass.
   The fish had been installed in front of Lynn and Kathey Kennedy's
tackle and fish-mounting business in Ninilchik, about 100 miles
southwest of Anchorage. Troopers said it was removed from its
mounting poles sometime Friday or Saturday.
   The trout of trouts is valued at $2,300, troopers said.

   Tired of paying for expensive deer
repellent, some farmers have adopted a substitute that makes for an
unusual sight across the countryside _ deodorant soap dangling from
trees like Christmas ornaments.
   Dennis Adams, a University of Nebraska extension forester, said
many subscribe to the old folk remedy that uses small pieces of
scented soap to help prevent deer from damaging trees.
   ``The damage has been increasing every year because the deer
population has been exploding,'' said Adams, who has hundreds of
small bars of soap hanging from trees on his farm.
   ``Some deer rub right next to the soap bars, but compared to the
damage we used to get, it's less,'' he said.
   Farmer William Holdorff has rigged bars of soap throughout his
orchard of 645 black walnut trees about 30 miles southeast of
Lincoln. He said he doesn't mind sharing some of his corn and milo
with deer, but needs some form of repellent to protect his small
trees.
   ``Actually, the odor isn't that strong or that repulsive, but
apparently the deer don't like it,'' Holdorff said. ``Their sense of
smell is more developed than ours.''
   At about 6 or 7 cents for a motel-size bar of soap, the cost is
much less than commercial deer repellents, he said. The small bars
of soap last through a growing season, he said.
   September is the best time to place soap in trees, Adams said.
One bar per tree should be hung from a branch at about the height of
a deer's nose, he said.

   Democrats ``heard it through the
grapevine,'' and now they want everyone else in the San Joaquin
Valley to hear a crack Vice President George Bush made about their
dancing raisins.
   Democratic House Whip Tony Coelho and the California Democratic
Party on Monday aired radio advertisements in the Fresno region
slamming Bush for a derogatory remark he made after canceling what
would have been his fourth campaign trip to the area.
   Bush said he ``didn't want to see those damned dancing raisins
again,'' according to his press secretary, Sheila Tate, who told the
Fresno Bee that Bush was only kidding.
   But in Fresno, the cereal bowl of the nation's raisin production,
insulting the popular dancing raisins could be considered sour
grapes, reasoned Coelho, who represents the region's raisin ranchers.
   People dressed in purple raisin suits have danced at numerous
events, including past Bush rallies in Fresno.
   ``Now they're after our raisins,'' Coelho says in the radio spot.
``Let's elect leaders who stand up for us.''
   Bush's local campaign chairman, Charles Poochigian, called the
radio ad ``a last-gasp effort to exploit a minor quip.''

<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ecological doomsayers and wary
scientists gathered Monday for a brainstorming session on how to
educate people about the consequences of global warming without
scaring them.
   In an address opening the World Congress on Climate and
Development, former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt spelled out
the ecological evils that have plagued the Earth with droughts and
floods and threatened ultimate destruction of the environment.
   He also pointed to the emergence of Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and the imminent change of the U.S. presidency as a hope
for new attention on the environment.
   ``I think one should not be too optistimic about it, but regard
it as a first step'' that Washington and Moscow have made some
progress on arms control and regional conflicts, Brandt said at a
reception following his speech.
   Referring to what he and other delegates see as a need to
redirect spending from defense to environmental recovery, Brandt
said the superpower initiatives ``could lead to substantially more
productive talks on transfer of funds from the one to the other.''
   The congress, which has drawn more than 400 participants from
East and West and from industrialized as well as developing
countries, aimed to get the diverse nations and interests working
together to slow down a trend that portends drastic environmental
change.
   Former Swedish Prime Minister Ola Ullsten pointed to this year's
drought in the United States as an example of climatic consequences
that are ``emptying the world's food baskets.''
   If U.S. farmers are hit by an equally severe drought in 1989,
food shortages will result, Ullsten said.
   ``We are not talking about the distant future, we are talking
about next year,'' he warned.
   While the assembled ecologists were shelled with a barrage of
environmental warnings, organizers said the aim of the conference is
to work out practical solutions.
   ``We do not want to create a sense of panic here or a stampede
that would have the consequence of limiting action to a small number
of countries that have the resources to react,'' said Hans-Jurgen
Karpe of the University of Dortmund's Institute for Environmental
Protection.
   But he and others concede a sense of urgency must be instilled in
the public to counter the ``greenhouse effect'' _ the buildup of
gases in the atmosphere that swaddle the Earth and keep in too much
of the sun's heat.
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency predicted in a draft
report issued last month that the warming trend is expected to raise
the average global temperature by 2 to 4 degrees by the middle of
the next century.
   It also could destroy coastline, cut deeply into U.S. crop yields
and create water and energy crises affecting much of the nation, the
report said.
   New measuring equipment pioneered by Canadian researchers has
also disclosed recently that the hole in the Earth's protective
ozone layer exposes an area as large as the United States.
   That gaping hole in the southern seam of the ozone lays bare the
unpopulated Antarctic region. But some scientists fear the northern
hemisphere is in for a similar breakdown of the barrier that shields
the Earth from the sun's cancer-threataning ultraviolet rays.
   ``The Antarctic ozone hole is half the world away from Canada,
but there is the threat of an Arctic ozone hole developing, and that
is close to a lot of Canadians,'' said John Reid, an atmospheric
scientist from the Department of the Environment in Canada.
   The problems, their causes and consequences are clear, the
organizers of the Hamburg conference say. What is needed is a plan
of action for curbing mankind's polluting habits.
   Some of the participants, such as Michael Glantz of the National
Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., contend the
environmental alarms being set off over global warming are
pressuring societies to act without knowing what action to take or
whether climatic stability is a desirable objective.
   ``There are always winners and losers, even in environmental
issues,'' Glantz said at the opening of the four-day congress.
   ``Many of the predictions have positive consequences for some
countries, such as heavier rain in regions that are currently
plagued by drought,'' he said.

   A jury on Monday cleared rock star John
Fogerty of an accusation that he plagiarized one of his own
Creedence Clearwater Revival songs for the tune of a recent solo hit.
   The six-member U.S. District Court jury deliberated less than
three hours before ruling unanimously against the copyright
infringement claim by Fantasy Records, which owns the rights to most
of the Creedence songs.
   The suit claimed ``Old Man Down the Road,'' lead single from
Fogerty's comeback ``Centerfield'' solo album in 1985, copied the
melody of ``Run Through the Jungle,'' which Fogerty wrote for
Creedence in 1970.
   Fogerty's defense included two days on the witness stand with
guitar in hand, playing many of his compositions to demonstrate his
style. The 43-year-old musician contended any similarities between
the songs were part of his musical style, dubbed ``swamp rock.''
   Fogerty was lead singer and songwriter for Creedence, one of the
nation's top rock bands from 1967 to 1972. After the group broke up
in 1972, he had no major commercial successes as a solo artist until
``Centerfield.''
   The suit is one of several legal disputes between Fogerty and
Saul Zaentz, principal owner of Fantasy Records. Zaentz has sued
Fogerty for libel over two other songs on ``Centerfield,'' one
called ``Mr. Greed'' and the other originally titled ``Zanz Kant
Danz.''

<HEAD>Editorial Boards Uninspired By Campaign, Candidates</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Editorial boards of the nation's newspapers generally faulted the
presidential campaigns of George Bush and Michael Dukakis as
negative and uninspiring, and many found the candidates equally
disappointing.
   Some papers declined to make a presidential endorsement. Others
voiced strong reservations even while making their choice.
   The Morning Call of Allentown, Pa., called Bush ``a less-than
inspired choice'' but endorsed him anyway on grounds of his
government experience, a view reflected in many editorials.
   In Dukakis' hometown, The Boston Globe said it was endorsing the
Massachusetts Democrat ``despite our uneasiness'' with his
leadership style and the ``lack of focus in his campaign.'' But the
Boston Herald, referring to its earlier backing of Dukakis, wrote:
``To those both within and outside the state we urge, don't make our
mistake.''
   Some of the sentiment was summed up by the Centre Daily Times of
State College, Pa., which endorsed Dukakis but said, ``Neither
candidate has greatly inspired the electorate with his character,
ideas or vision.''
   The Washington Post endorsed no one and called this year's race
``a terrible campaign, a national disappointment.''
   The Post said it could not ``in good faith argue for the
vindication of the cheap shots that have animated George Bush's
campaign ... or close our eyes to alarming deficiencies of the
Democratic candidate as a prospective president.''
   The St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch in Minnesota endorsed both
candidates after its eight-member editorial board divided down the
middle, and said: ``When you add up the pluses and the minuses, the
net results don't overwhelmingly favor one or the other.''
   The New York Times said both candidates were better men than had
been communicated in a ``sour, superficial, misleading campaign''
and that ``America is likely to be well served if either man is
elected.''
   The Times gave its nod to Dukakis, based on its expectation that
he would be the most effective at ``getting America out of hock''
from its huge deficits.
   Many newspapers cited Bush's experience in Washington as a plus,
while others were critical of his selection of Sen. Dan Quayle of
Indiana as a running mate and questioned the GOP presidential
nominee's ability to tame the deficit.
   The Star-Ledger of Newark, N.J., endorsed Bush, saying: ``An
examination of Mr. Bush's long record in federal service reads like
the curriculum of a preparatory course for the presidency. There are
few areas of policy-making in which he is not experienced.''
   But the Philadelphia Daily News said Bush has become a candidate
``who takes the lowest road possible; who pretends, despite all the
evidence that J. Danforth Quayle is not a callow moron.''
   Its sister newspaper, The Philadelphia Inquirer, said Bush ``left
no notable legacy'' in his appointive positions and had
``negligible'' impact on the Reagan administration.
   Dukakis was credited for his leadership record as Massachusetts
governor, but critics questioned his personal compassion and his
credentials on foreign policy and national defense.
   The Miami Herald said Bush ``emerges as a seasoned leader with
growth potential while Mr. Dukakis is ever the earnest technocrat.
The nation doesn't need an ill-defined iceman; it needs a
president.''
   But the St. Louis Post-Dispatch said of Dukakis, ``What he may
lack in emotional appeal, he more than makes up for in common sense,
compassion and commitment.''
   Connecticut's largest daily, The Hartford Courant, said both
candidates' campaigns ``have been uninspiring, and often downright
disgusting'' but it endorsed Republican Bush and welcomed his call
for a ``kinder and gentler nation.''
   ``We do need a kinder, gentler nation,'' said the Flint (Mich.)
Journal. ``That's why we're endorsing Michael S. Dukakis.''
   The Star Tribune of Minneapolis also gave the nod to Dukakis but
said, ``As this unenlightening presidential campaign nears an end,
it shows ever more vividly its two main shortcomings: George Bush
and Michael Dukakis.''
   Kentucky's two largest newspapers _ The Courier-Journal of
Louisville and the Lexington Herald-Leader _ endorsed Dukakis, with
the former voicing concern that on the deficit, ``George Bush has
given no indication that he will rise above the expediency of the
moment.''
   The Seattle Times broke with a long tradition of endorsing
Republican presidential candidates to support Dukakis, saying Bush
``clings to the eight-year Reagan legacy and promises he would
provide four more years of the same. This is not reassuring.''
   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, meanwhile, backed Bush, saying
``Dukakis' lack of emotion ... and his seeming inability to respond
either quickly or forcefully to Bush attacks on his positions have
raised legitimate questions about his capacity for timely response
in time of crisis.''
   New Mexico's largest paper, the Albuquerque Journal, expressed
its confidence in the vice president: ``George Bush doesn't really
need an endorsement; the people of New Mexico and other mainstream
states already know the vice president is ready to grasp the reins.''
   In California, the San Francisco Chronicle and the San Francisco
Examiner both backed Bush, the latter speculating that ``his
appointees to the Supreme Court would not be constitutional
extremists.''
   Among papers backing Bush are: The Pittsburgh Press; The
Albuquerque Tribune; The Arizona Republic; the Phoenix Gazette; The
Times of Shreveport, La.; The Times-Picayune of New Orleans; the Los
Angeles Herald Examiner; The Knoxville (Tenn.) Journal; the Houston
Chronicle; The Houston Post; The Dallas Morning News; the Dallas
Times Herald; The Oregonian of Portland; the New York Daily News;
the Omaha (Neb.) World-Herald; the Chicago Tribune; the Chicago
Sun-Times; The Plain Dealer of Cleveland; the Atlanta Journal; and
The Detroit News.
   Among the papers that endorsed Dukakis: the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette; The Journal-Gazette in Fort Wayne, Ind.; The
Shreveport (La.) Journal; The Tennessean in Nashville; The
Chattanooga (Tenn.) Times; the Kansas City (Mo.) Star and Times; The
Wichita (Kan.) Eagle-Beacon; Santa Fe New Mexican; The Lincoln
(Neb.) Star; the Atlanta Constitution; and the Detroit Free Press.

<HEAD>Trial Begins in Woman's Suit Against Parole Board for Releasing
Inmate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trial began Monday in the lawsuit of a
woman who was shot and paralyzed by a parolee and is now seeking $4
million in damages from three state Parole Board members.
   Opening arguments began in the suit of former bank executive
Linda Grantham, 46, of Florence, who was shot in February 1985 by
parolee Clem Jimpson. She remains paralyzed from the neck down.
   If Grantham wins her suit, ``not only the Parole Board, but any
public official or employee could face far-reaching liability in the
course of their duties,'' Deputy Attorney General Robert Gibbs said.
   On May 2, the state Supreme Court ruled that Grantham has the
right to sue the three Parole Board members who voted for Jimpson's
parole _ Ollie Sykes, James Figgs and Paul Carter. One other member
voted against parole while a fifth member was not at the meeting.
   The Supreme Court had overturned a 1986 ruling by Circuit Judge
William F. Coleman of Hinds County, who said members were immune
under state law because they had acted in their official capacity.
   Jimpson was paroled from the Mississippi State Penitentiary at
Parchman on Jan. 9, 1985, after serving 12 years and three months of
a life sentence for murdering a convenience store clerk.
   The lawsuit alleged the board did not review his case properly,
failing to take into account such things as his behavior in prison
and the nature of his original crime.
   Jimpson shot Grantham at a parking lot of a bank where she was an
assistant vice president. Prosecutors said he thought she was
carrying cash from the bank.
   The 60-year-old Jimpson is serving a sentence of life without
parole at Parchman for shooting Grantham.
   Grantham's attorney, Lisa Milner, said a victory by her client
could affect the way criminals are paroled.
   ``I think the outcome, if we win, will have an effect on the
process in the future,'' she said. Problems might not exist ``if the
Parole Board was doing what is required by law,'' she said. ``Our
position is they are not.''

<HEAD>Gucci Heir Gets Suspended Sentence For Attempted Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maurizio Gucci, an heir of the founder of the
Gucci luxury goods company, was convicted of attempted tax fraud
Monday and given a $750 fine and a one-year suspended sentence.
   Vittorio Ajello, the lawyer for Gucci, said the decision means
Gucci will regain control of shares that will give him half of the
company.
   Gucci was accused of having arranged the falsification of the
signature on the documents to avoid paying inheritance taxes by
making it appear that his father, Rodolfo, transferred ownership of
the shares before his death in 1983.
   Gucci's ownership of the shares was not in question, only when
the transfer was made. The court froze the shares to assure he could
pay any fine levied in the tax fraud case.
   He had faced a possible penalty of three years in jail and a fine
of about $23 million.
   However, the court fined Gucci only $750. It also gave him a
one-year suspended sentence and said his criminal record will be
expunged at the end of the year. Gucci also must pay the inheritance
tax on the shares.
   The court also convicted Gucci employees Gian Vittorio Pilone and
Ciro De Vincenzo, the notary that authenticated the signatures, of
the same charges. The two were given the same suspended sentence and
fine. The court also prohibited De Vincenzo from acting as a notary
for one year.
   The court also acquitted four others, including a woman accused
of actually signing the documents.
   Gucci is the great grandson of Guccio Gucci, who founded the
company in 1922. The company has 180 stores worldwide and its sales
last year totaled $170 million.

   A pre-dawn offshore earthquake rattled the
westside of Los Angeles on Monday, but no damage or injuries were
reported.
   The temblor at 5:27 a.m. measured 2.6 on the Richter scale and
was centered one mile southwest of Santa Monica, said Robert Finn, a
spokesman for the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
   ``It was a single jolt,'' said police Lt. Richard Molony. ``It
was like someone bumped into my desk.''
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude, or the height of quake-generated shock waves recorded
on a seismograph.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage
in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6
severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.

   Writers and filmmakers on the cutting edge of
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost have been
honored with the 1988 State Prizes, the Tass news agency said.
   Writer Vladimir Dudintsev won for his novel ``White Clothes,'' a
story of repression of scientists in the Soviet Union, Tass said.
   Among the other winners were the makers of the film ``Is It Easy
to be Young?'' The film has become popular for its discussion of
youth problems.
   Also honored was a film crew from Kiev that made the documentary,
``Chernobyl, the Chronology of the Hard Weeks,'' which portrayed the
Chernobyl nuclear power accident in April 1986, and its consequences.
   The novel and the two films could not have been released a few
years ago, before Gorbachev instituted his policy of greater
openness. But many long suppressed films and books are being brought
into the open now, and artists are taking on more controversial
issues.

<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan took his last,
sentimental bow on the campaign stage Monday with a plea for
California voters to assure a ``new beginning for America'' by
tipping the balance in favor of Republican presidential nominee
George Bush.
   In speeches delivered alongside the retired ocean liner Queen
Mary at Long Beach and at a rally near San Diego's performing arts
center, Reagan saluted old friends, ``freedom fighters'' and
political prisoners, and paid a rare public tribute to his parents.
   ``So now, we come to the end of this last campaign, and I just
hope that Nelle and Jack are looking down on us right now and
nodding their heads and saying their boy did them proud,'' Reagan
said.
   Likewise, he told his listeners he hoped they would tell their
children and grandchildren that ``a certain president came to town
at the end of a long journey'' and that ``a century of peace,
prosperity, opportunity and hope followed.''
   Climaxing 25,000 miles of travel to 16 states on Bush's behalf,
the president stressed that California, with its 47 electoral votes,
could provide the margin of victory for the GOP ticket in Tuesday's
election. Recent polls show Bush and Dukakis have fought virtually
to a draw in the nation's most populous state.
   ``Today, of course, is the last day of this, my last campaign as
president,'' he said in Long Beach. ``But tomorrow launches a new
beginning for America.
   ``Your votes tomorrow may be the most important ones cast in
America. They will determine how California goes, and California may
send the next president to the White House.''
   Reagan was returning Monday night to the White House, where he
will watch election returns Tuesday night with friends and political
advisers. Aides said Bush was expected to meet with Reagan there
Wednesday.
   On his arrival at Long Beach, reporters asked Reagan what the
polls were telling him. The president grinned and replied, ``I'm
going to wait and see what that last poll tells me tomorrow.''
   Asked if he had a hunch about the outcome, he replied, ``I'm
afraid to say what it is. I'm superstitious.''
   Although the Bush campaign clearly expected Reagan to provide a
crucial boost in California, his speech indicated that his reasons
for making the 14-hour round trip between Washington and the West
Coast on election eve were as much personal as political.
   ``I'm not doing this just for George Bush,'' he told GOP
stalwarts in San Diego in his most personal and introspective speech
in years. ``I'm doing it for the country of course, but for someone
else as well _ actually for two other people.''
   Reagan has inserted references to his mother in a few speeches
recently, but he has hardly ever spoken publicly of his father, an
alcoholic shoe salesman whom he described Monday as ``the best
storyteller I've ever heard _ and the strongest man of principle
I've ever known.''
   The president said Jack Reagan once nearly caught pneumonia
sleeping in his car instead of taking a room in the only hotel in
town because ``it discriminated against certain groups of people.''
   He said that even in the darkest days of the Depression, his
parents never refused a meal to anyone who knocked on their door.
   ``So, you see, I'm also campaigning this year for them,'' Reagan
said. ``A son of Jack and Nelle Reagan never walked away from a
battle on principle. This year's election is that kind of fight, and
by darn, we're going to win it.''
   At the get-out-the-vote rally in San Diego, Reagan sounded a bit
wistful when he noted that his name won't be on the ballot Tuesday.
But he said that didn't matter ``because something more important is
_ a principle, a legacy.''
   He added: ``No, this is not the end of an era; it is a time to
refresh and strengthen the `new beginning' we started eight years
ago.''
   He said the importance of Tuesday's balloting extended far beyond
U.S. shores.
   ``Tomorrow on the plains of Afghanistan and in jungles around the
world, freedom fighters will huddle close to their radios, hoping to
catch word that the administration in America will remain their
friend,'' he said.
   ``In cells across the globe, political prisoners will wait
anxiously for assurance that America has chosen strength over
weakness, because for many of them, our strength is all that keeps
their hopes alive. ... And so help me God, we won't let them down,''
Reagan said.

<TEXT>
   An ophthalmologist who pleaded innocent Monday
to charges he bilked the Medicare program will be allowed to keep
practicing while the matter is pending, a prosecutor said.
   Dr. Richard D. Levin, 42, described by authorities as the largest
Medicaid biller in Ohio, stood quietly as he was arraigned in
federal court on the 328-count fraud indictment.
   He could face penalties of up to five years in prison and a
$250,000 fine on each count, federal prosecutors said.
   Levin, of suburban Indian Hill, pleaded innocent on behalf of
himself and his company, Levin Eye Institute, which runs six eye
clinics in Ohio and northern Kentucky.
   He is accused of billing Medicare for eye operations or other
treatments that were not done, or for having told the government he
performed tests on both a patient's eyes when only one eye was
tested. Prosecutors said there was no evidence his patients were
aware of it.
   The indictment also alleges that Levin's company received
kickbacks or discounts from companies in connection with purchases
of lenses used in cataract surgery, but failed to reduce the lens
prices to reflect the discounts when claims were submitted for
payment.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Ann Marie Tracey said the case is one of
the biggest involving alleged Medicare fraud that the government has
prosecuted. Federal investigators haven't said publicly how much the
alleged fraud amounted to during the four years under investigation.
But they said Levin has billed Medicare for a total of $18 million
the past four years.
   Despite the size of the case, Ms. Tracey made no effort Monday to
limit Levin's right to travel or to restrict his practice while the
case is pending. U.S. Magistrate J. Vincent Aug permitted Levin to
remain free on his own recognizance.

<HEAD>Sudan Receiving Military Aid From Libya, Premier Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMED OSMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi said Sudan
received military aid from Libya to help quell a southern rebellion,
but he denied allegations that Libyan troops were fighting alongside
the Sudanese army.
   Mahdi spoke to reporters after a Cabinet meeting Sunday that
focused on Sudan's economic crisis, last week's riots against food
shortages and relations with neighboring Libya.
   Six days of riots that began Oct. 29 in Khartoum injured 58
police officers and five other people, Mahdi said.
   The rioting was started by high school students who were later
joined by university students and Moslem fundamentalists.
   Thousands of young people took to the streets of the capital to
protest shortages of staples such as bread and sugar, as well as
soaring prices. The protesters hurled stones at public buildings,
burned tires and clashed with police, who countered with tear gas
and batons.
   Mahdi said the rioters destroyed a police station and caused
minor damage to the Internal Trade Ministry building. Twenty
vehicles, including three private cars, were completely or partially
wrecked, he said.
   Elyaba James Surur, leader of the opposition Union of Sudanese
African Parties, said Sunday that Libyan troops were helping
Sudanese soldiers fight the southern rebels, who are mostly
Christians and animists demanding greater autonomy from the
Moslem-dominated government.
   Surur, whose union represents a group of southern factions, said
the Libyans operate from a headquarters at Juba, the capital of the
southern region of Equatoria.
   The rebellion, which began in 1983, is costing the government
about $1 million every day. Sudan suffers from a chronic shortage of
hard currency and has built up a foreign debt of about $13 billion,
defaulting on repayment.
   Mahdi acknowledged his government has received military aid from
Libya and other Arab countries, but he denied the presence of Libyan
troops in the south.
   ``Those fighting the (southern rebellion) are 100 percent
Sudanese troops,'' Mahdi said.
   In 1987, Sudanese officials said four Libyan-supplied MiG-23
warplanes flew combat missions against southern rebels. At least one
was reported to have crashed.
   The government repeatedly has charged that neighboring Ethiopia
provides arms and money to the Sudan People's Liberation Army of
rebels led by John Garang, a former Sudanese army colonel.

<TEXT>
   A Palestinian worker angry over
unpaid wages killed a soldier on guard duty at a Jewish settlement
Monday and an Israeli farmer shot the assailant to death, witnesses
reported.
   The Palestinian shouted ``Allahu Akbar,'' an Islamic war cry
meaning ``God is great,'' as he stabbed the soldier, said settlers
at the Massua cooperative farm 26 miles northeast of Jerusalem.
   Army spokesmen confirmed a Palestinian woman was shot to death in
a West Bank village.
   Arab sources said 21 Palestinians were wounded by soldiers in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, where a revolt against Israeli occupation
began Dec. 8, 1987, among the 1.5 million Palestinian residents.
   Hospital officials said two 9-year-olds were among the wounded _
one shot in the leg and the other in the chest.
   A military court in the Gaza Strip sentenced the leader of a
guerrilla squad to three consecutive life prison terms for murdering
three other Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel. A
second member of the guerrilla group was sentenced to one life term.
   Eleven Israelis and at least 309 Palestinians have been killed in
the Palestinian uprising, which enters its 12th month Tuesday. The
guard at Massua was the second soldier killed.
   According to the army, the 21-year-old attacker approached the
soldier about 9 a.m., drew a knife and ``stabbed him repeatedly, at
least a dozen times.''
   Tanya Ben-Ami reported seeing the attack from the nearby farm
office. ``In the beginning there was a struggle,'' she said. ``In
the end, (the Arab) just kept stabbing all the time. He didn't
stop.''
   She said a farmer on leave from army reserve duty was with her,
ran to get his gun and opened fire after the Palestinian picked up a
chair and threatened him. Ms. Ben-Ami said the farmer ``didn't have
a choice. He shot him.''
   Settlers said the Palestinian attacked after the soldier
requested additional identification. The army spokesman said he had
worked at the farm and and was angry about not receiving back pay of
170 shekels, about $100.
   The slain soldier was identified as Cpl. David Danieli and the
Palestinian's papers said he was Ahmad Hussein Abdullah Basharat of
Tamoun village, near Jenin.
   An area about five yards square was roped off by the time
reporters were allowed at the scene, with a chair in the middle
where the soldier had sat.
   A pool of blood was in front of the chair. Underneath it were an
overturned thermos, a radio and a book printed in Hebrew.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Gen. Dan Shomron, army chief
of staff, visited Massua after the shooting. Settlers complained to
Rabin about lack of security and he told reporters in English: ``We
cannot go on without a proper response to what happened here today.''
   Igal Hanassy, a 41-year-old farmer, told Rabin as he left that
Palestinians working at the cooperative should be replaced with
Jewish volunteers. Rabin said he had nothing to do with arranging
for volunteers, Hanassy told reporters later.
   Asked about security, Hanassy replied: ``It's obviously not
enough. There was only one soldier at the gate. He was killed.''
   The Massua farm, about 18 years old, is a mile from the border
opposite a Jordanian village. The settlers grow bananas, grapes,
dates and flowers with the help of 100 or so Palestinians who work
as day laborers.
   In Jerusalem, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud
bloc and the center-left Labor Party of Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres continued competing for the chance to form a government after
last week's inconclusive elections.
   Attacks on Israelis tend to boost the fortunes of hard-liners and
a firebomb attack on a bus Oct. 30 that killed a teacher and her
three young sons was believed to have cost Labor three seats in the
120-member Knesset, or parliament.
   Likud won 40 seats, one more than Labor, and is given the best
chance of making a coaliton with religious and rightist parties.
   Army spokesmen said soldiers went on the offensive Monday against
Palestinian rioters in the occupied territories, which Israel
captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 war.
   They said a 23-year-old woman was killed when soldiers opened
fire during a large, violent protest at Salem village 3 miles east
of Nablus. A resident reached by telephone at a Salem hospital said
the dead woman was Ismat Jamil Mahmoud, 20.

<TEXT>
   The alleged leader of a failed coup in
Maldives said he was motivated by political ambition, Indian
television reported Monday.
   But Abdullah Luthufi, in a television interview, said he was not
entirely responsible for Thursday's aborted attack by an estimated
150 Sri Lankan mercenaries in the Maldivian capital of Male, the
television said.
   Officials said 14 people were killed and 40 wounded in fighting.
Luthufi and some mercenaries fled Maldives Friday with 27 hostages
aboard a cargo ship, but surrendered two days later to the Indian
navy.
   Doordarshan, India's government-owned television, interviewed
Luthufi aboard the Indian frigate Godavari after his capture.
   Maldivian Foreign Minister Fathulla Jameel said Luthufi, once an
aide to former President Ibrahim Nasir, conducted operations and
directed mercenaries during the coup attempt.
   Luthufi, a businessman, told the television he was not entirely
responsible for the decisions, but ``given this opportunity,'' he
became politically ambitious. He did not elaborate on who else was
responsible.
   Nasir, whose followers have staged failed coups in 1980 and 1983,
has denied involvement.
   Luthufi was among 46 people on board the cargo ship ``Progress
Light'' who surrendered to Indian commandos. The ship, crippled by
Indian fire, sank in the Indian Ocean on Monday, officials said.
   When it sank, there were no passengers on board the ship, Arun
Banerjee, India's High Commissioner said. His rank is equivalent to
that of an Ambassador.
   At least four hostages aboard the ship died and 15 were injured
before the surrender, the television said. Indian officials would
not say how the hostages were killed and injured.
   Maldivian Transport Minister Ahmad Mujuthaba was among the
injured hostages removed to a hospital in the southern Indian port
city of Trivandrum.
   In Male, Maldivian authorities detained more than 100 suspected
sympathizers of the coup attempt.
   ``Searches are being carried out for those suspected to have been
left behind by the mercenaries,'' President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom
said.
   Maldivian and Indian officials say most of the 150-member
mercenary force escaped by sea. Indian naval ships have been
searching the area.
   The president had requested Indian assistance to quell the coup
in his 2,000-island nation. He has vowed to try the mercenaries.
   Gayoom, 50, was elected president in 1978 after Nasir resigned
and fled to Singapore. Nasir, 62, has been accused of
misappropriating $4.2 million in state funds during his 10-year rule.
   Gayoom is scheduled to begin a third term Friday.

<HEAD>Firm Agrees To Pay $50,000 Fine In `Dial-a-Porn' Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A California firm agreed Monday to pay a
$50,000 fine and stop transmitting obscene messages on interstate
telephone lines in a case which the government said signals all
``dial-a-porn'' services that they must act to keep their material
inaccessible to children.
   Audio Enterprises Inc., of Mill Valley, Calif., and operator
Wendy King signed the agreement, entailing one the first dial-a-porn
fines imposed by the Federal Communications Commission.
   ``The $50,000 payment that the dial-a-porn operator will have to
pay to the government ... shows that there will be a high price
attached to failure to obey the law scrupulously in this important
area,'' said Gerald Brock, head of the FCC's common carrier bureau.
   ``This sends a signal there are some teeth in the law,'' Brock
said. Enforcement of the civil penalty was done ``quickly and
efficiently compared with the alternative of extensive and costly
litigation,'' he said.
   FCC officials said Audio Enterprises is effectively out of
business. There was no current listing for the company in telephone
information.
   To resume operations, King or Audio Enterprises must tone down
the messages and use access codes, credit cards or scrambling
equipment to prevent children under 18 from dialing. Such operations
will be monitored by the FCC, according to the agreement.
   The FCC launched its investigation of Audio Enterprises after a
mother in California wrote that her 13-year-old son and his friends
spent $74 dialing a pay-to-listen 900-number for 211 minutes.
   Also listening was the woman's daughter, who was later molested
by two boys who had heard the tapes, the woman wrote. ``This phone
call has damaged our lives,'' the woman wrote.
   The FCC informed Audio Enterprises last December that it was in
apparent violation of FCC's rules that require companies to restrict
access of obscene material. The commission also informed Intercambio
Inc., of San Jose, Calif., that it was in violation of the law, and
that case is still pending.
   The FCC determined the material broadcast by the two companies
was obscene. Under a Supreme Court's test, material is obscene if it
depicts sexual acts in a patently offensive way, appeals to the
prurient interest of an average person and lacks serious literary or
artistic value.
   FCC officials estimated Audio Enterprises collected about
$250,000 in revenues over a two-year period.
   Altogether, the dial-a-porn industry produces about $54 million
annually in revenue for providers and phone companies, according to
the Information Industry Bulletin.
   The FCC has referred some complaints to the Justice Department.
In May 1987, two dial-a-porn providers pleaded guilty to failing to
comply with the commission's rule. The court fined them each $50,000.
   Earlier this year, Congress passed a sweeping dial-a-porn law
that bans obscene and indecent commercial messages. The law has not
been enforced because of legal challenges in New York and California.
   The principal issue centers around the definition of indecent
material. The FCC deems material indecent if it depicts or describes
sexual or excretory organs or activities in a patently offensive
way. The dial-a-porn industry says the definition is too broad and
unconstitutional.
   Congress passed another measure last month, but it has not been
signed yet by President Reagan.

   Lloyd Bentsen stubbornly insisted an
election victory was in sight, telling voters there would be ``no
surrender'' as he capped his vice presidential campaign Monday with
a wild scurry across Texas and nearby swing states.
   ``No retreat, baby, no surrender,'' he said, quoting a Bruce
Springsteen song as he fired up supporters at an airport hangar in
this East Texas town.
   In Houston, Bentsen said he could ``remember how Jack Kennedy and
Lyndon Johnson carried Texas.'' Surrounded by family and political
allies, he asserted, ``We carry Texas and we carry it all.''
   About 3,000 people cheered the candidate as he spoke in the
Houston City Hall park where he and Dukakis had campaigned together
the day after the Democratic National Convention in July. The crowd
was even bigger then.
   ``Are we going to take Texas Democratic?'' he said. ``Are we
going to elect Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen president and vice
president of the United States?''
   Bentsen spent most of the day working in Texas despite polls
showing a double-digit lead for the Republicans there, and a recent
concession by one of Dukakis' top aides that the state was lost.
   ``Go flat out. ... Win Texas and then the United States,'' he
told supporters at a Dallas rally. ``It's in your hands to win it.
You can do it.''
   On the stage with Bentsen at Dallas' Union Station was a live
quail in a cage.
   ``How do you like the idea of George Bush as president and Dan
Quayle standing in the wings,'' he said, turning his thumb down as
the crowd hooted.
   Bentsen loaded his jet with Texas state officials, extra staff
and actress Lori Singer and took off with a loudspeaker in the cabin
blaring the theme song from the movie ``Top Gun.'' The unofficial
theme song for the former bomber pilot was repeated at rallies
throughout the day.
   He had the plane make a low-altitude pass of the runway before
landing in Shreveport, La. Then he strolled to the podium as the
high school band played, ``Where Is The Love.''
   ``The momentum is really going our way,'' he said, chiding
Republicans for
   ``popping their champagne corks'' too early.
   ``On Nov. 9, they're going to have one of the worst hangovers
they've ever had,'' he said.
   The 67-year-old candidate bounded back up the airplane stairs two
steps at a time.
   After Houston, Bentsen had two more stops in Texas _ Beaumont and
San Antonio _ before heading to Arkansas and Missouri. He planned to
return to the Texas capital city, Austin, when the campaign day was
to end only a few hours before the polls opened Tuesday.
   He planned to spend election day in Austin. He voted by absentee
ballot in Rio Grande City late last month.
   Bentsen continued to insist that Texas and its 29 electoral votes
are winnable for the Democrats, even though many polls show him and
Dukakis trailing by double digits.
   The Dukakis campaign's Boston headquarters added two more stops
outside of Texas to Bentsen's schedule for Monday: Little Rock,
Ark., and Kansas City, Mo. The campaign also considered sending
Bentsen back to California, where he has campaigned frequently.
   Although several state campaigns were trying to get him to appear
on the eve of the election, Bentsen said he insisted that he wrap up
his effort in Texas.
   For Bentsen, it was a day for hammering at the same themes that
he's used for weeks: attacking Bush's choice of Quayle as running
mate and echoing Dukakis' new populist theme of ``We're on your
side,and they're not.''
   He also jabbed at Bush, implying again that the vice president
was not a true Texan, as he claimed.
   Nearly 200 Texas banks have failed in the past few years, and
Bentsen accused George Bush of doing nothing for his claimed home
state while the Reagan administration was helping bankers in
Illinois and New York.``We want a Texan in there who's interested in
Texas,'' Bentsen said. ``We're going to help Texas.''
   Jim Hightower, the Texas state agriculture commissioner who
joined Bentsen's entourage Monday, said the senator was doing what
he needed to do even though the polls looked bad.
   ``We're not sitting and being poll watchers, but trying to be
pole vaulters,'' he said.
   Hightower said the populist message Dukakis was now using on the
stump should have come three months earlier and it may be too late.
``We're pedaling uphill with not very many minutes left,'' he said.

<HEAD>Report Faults State Department for Not Renewing Checks on Employees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional investigators on Monday faulted
the State Department for failing to update security checks on
thousands of long-term department employees who have access to top
secret information.
   The department ``has not reinvestigated about 75 percent of its
9,000 long-term employees in critical-sensitive positions, those who
had been working with the department for five or more years,'' the
General Accounting Office said.
   The number of people not reinvestigated after five years was
6,739, according to the GAO, which is the investigative arm of
Congress.
   ``About 44 percent of those eligible have not been reinvestigated
in the past 10 years or longer, and dozens of employees have not
been reinvestigated in 25 years or more,'' the GAO said. The number
not reinvestigated after 10 years was 3,908.
   Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, who requested the study, said, ``Just
because an individual was a good security risk five years ago
doesn't mean he still is.''
   ``As espionage cases of the past few years have clearly
demonstrated, U.S. government employees with security clearances and
access to classified information are prime targets for recruitment
by foreign intelligence operatives,'' Brooks said.
   State Department officials said they had no comment on the report.
   State Department security investigators devote most of their
energy to people seeking employment, and were failing to meet their
own goal of completing such reviews within 90 days.
   The State Department took an average of 140 days for such
pre-employment investigations, the GAO said.
   ``A major reason for the accumulated backlog is the low priority
the department has given reinvestigations,'' the report said.
``State has not focused on reinvestigations but instead has used its
investigative resources primarily on `suitability reviews,' which
are used to reduce the number of applicants for foreign service
positions.
   ``In essence, State has been giving a higher priority to
investigating a large number of people who will never be hired
rather than to investigating people already in sensitive jobs,'' it
said.
   Among the employees the GAO said the State Department failed to
investigate as required after five years were:
   _A science officer who had top secret clearance to NATO matters
and to coding information violated department regulations in 1982 by
traveling to a Soviet bloc country without authorization. ``Also in
1982, while the employee was assigned to a post in the Soviet Union,
the KGB learned of his homosexual orientation and, threatening
disclosure, sought to recruit him as a spy.'' No reinvestigation was
ever done on this employee. His clearances were pulled after he
allegedly engaged in a homosexual encounter with a minor.
   _An economic affairs officer, hired in 1973, was criticized for
violating security procedures in 1979 for leaving classified
material unattended on his desk. He also violated department
policies by having affairs with Soviet and Czechoslovak women. The
employee's security clearance was not lifted until he was arrested
by the Drug Enforcement Administration in January 1986 for allegedly
trying to manufacture the illegal drug LSD.
   _An employee who received a security clearance in 1980 had his
clearance suspended after he sired a child by an East German woman.
He had not been reinvestigated as required in 1985.

<TEXT>
   With the blessings of a bishop and the
salutes of nearly 1,000 police officers, the city buried a police
recuit Monday who died 44 days after collapsing on his first day of
training, a session that sparked turmoil in the state's law
enforcement agencies.
   Hundreds of residents, unable to get in the packed 1,500-seat
church, lined both sides of the main street outside St. Joseph's
Church as the Most Rev. Joseph Maguire, Roman Catholic bishop of
Springfield, said the funeral Mass for 25-year-old Timothy Shepard.
   ``Timothy did not quite realize his desire to be a police
officer, but perhaps in God's mysterious plan he may have had a
higher role,'' the bishop said.
   Shepard's illness and the hospitalization of 15 other cadets in
late September led to at least three state probes, the resignation
of the head of the state's police training programs, and the
transfer of State Police instructors and the director of the Agawam
academy where the cadet collapsed.
   The service was broadcast on loudspeakers, and there was
bitterness and sadness on the faces of the residents who stood in
the chilly November drizzle for more than two hours.
   Many residents, such as Irene Kibbee, had not known the young
man, who was married in June and whose wife is pregnant. But they
knew he was the most seriously stricken of the cadets who were
hospitalized with exhaustion and dehydration following a grueling
regimen of laps and pushups on a few cups of water.
   ``It's so senseless. What did they think they were doing with
that training?'' Mrs. Kibbee said. ``Your heart can't help but go
out to that poor boy's family.''
   Pittsfield Police Officer Anthony Riello said Shepard's death has
created ambivalence in the force about training methods.
   ``The mood in the department is extremely sullen,'' he said.
``The problem we have in dealing with it (Shepard's death) is that
it is so senseless. It shouldn't have happened.''
   The last Pittsfield officer to die in the line of duty was killed
in 1898 while pushing a woman and her children to safety off the
tracks of an oncoming train.
   The funeral cortege, the largest ever in this city of 50,000
people, took nearly 15 minutes to pass. Two Pittsfield police
cruisers led the way, followed by motorcycle officers, mounted
police and more than 100 cruisers from Nantucket to Schnectady, N.Y.
Their lights flashed in a sea of twinkling blue and red as they
slowly passed the silent crowd.
   State Police were represented by three cruisers. They had scaled
back plans for six cruisers when Shepard's family asked that they
not attend because of bitterness over his training by state
troopers. The family withdrew the request Sunday, according to Mayor
Anne Everest Wojtkowski.
   ``They reconsidered and agreed that there are many fine and
compassionate state policemen and they should be made welcome,'' she
said.
   Shepard collapsed Sept. 19 from heat stroke and was flown to a
Pittsburgh hospital while still in a coma for a liver transplant.
   The cadet had emerged from a coma after two weeks and was slowly
recovering _ even writing his wife, ``I made it'' _ when he fell
unconscious again Oct. 31 and was rushed into emergency surgery to
remove a blood clot on his brain.
   He was pronounced dead Wednesday. An autopsy indicated he died
from infections that set in because of his weakened condition.
   His death is the subject of an inquest later this month to
determine whether criminal charges should be brought against the
instructors.

<HEAD>Consumer Debt Grew $1.9 Billion In September</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans took out $1.88 billion more in
consumer debt than they paid off in September, the smallest advance
in 10 months, the government reported Monday.
   The Federal Reserve said that the September increase in consumer
debt was down from an August rise of $5.32 billion and was the
smallest monthly advance since a $1.79 billion rise in November 1987.
   While much of the decline in September was traced to weak auto
sales, economists said that the pattern of the past several months
showed that consumers had grown more cautious in their buying plans.
   From July through September, consumer debt rose at an annual rate
of 6.75 percent, down significantly from a 10.2 percent growth rate
in the first six months of the year.
   ``Consumer debt in the third quarter grew at one of the slowest
rates of this recovery,'' said Michael Evans, head of a Washington
forecasting firm. ``There are increasing signs that consumers are
becoming more cautious as they cut back on spending and try to
reduce their debt loads.''
   Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of all economic
activity. Evans said the consumer slowdown is a primary reason he is
looking for economic growth next year to be less than half of this
year's pace.
   The overall economy, as measured by the gross national product,
is expected to rise by 3.8 percent this year, the best performance
since 1984. Evans predicted 1989 growth would be a lackluster 2
percent.
   For September, auto loans edged up a modest $49 million following
a $2.2 billion increase in August. The big drop in auto loans
reflected the absence of widespread auto sales incentive programs,
the government said. These programs to reduce swollen inventories
had boosted sales in the three previous years.
   The category which includes credit card debt rose by $1.5 billion
in September, down from a $2.6 billion August increase.
   Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate edged up
$342 million, compared to an August increase of $449 million, while
loans for mobile homes actually fell by $29 million following a $33
million increase in August.
   The various changes left total consumer debt at a seasonally
adjusted $655.2 billion in September. Total consumer debt was 8.6
percent higher than a year ago.

   The Supreme Court on Monday refused to block
the execution of Florida killer Jeffrey Joseph Daugherty, facing
electrocution for one of four murders he committed 12 years ago.
   The justices, by a 5-4 vote, turned down an emergency request
aimed at sparing Daugherty's life.
   Daugherty's execution was scheduled for 5:01 p.m. EST. The high
court announced its decision six minutes earlier.
   Daugherty, 33, was convicted of the 1976 shooting death of
Lavonne Patricia Sailer, a Brevard County hitchhiker who was robbed
of $15 and left to die in a county dump. She was shot five times.
   Daugherty was convicted of three other murders committed in what
prosecutors called a three-week murder spree while he, his
girlfriend and his uncle traveled from Michigan to Florida.
   Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun
and John Paul Stevens voted to spare Daugherty.
   The case is Daugherty vs. Florida, A-366.

   A passenger train traveling from
Luxembourg to Paris hit a maintenance car on a service track Monday
and derailed in a village station in northeastern France, killing
nine railroad employees.
   No passengers were killed. Twelve passengers were injured along
with the driver of the train, but none seriously.
   The accident occurred on a track at Ay, a village near Epernay,
85 miles east of Paris.
   The maintenance car was on the service track, and it was not
immediately clear why the passenger train was directed that way,
where railway employees were working, rather than on the main line
through the station.
   ``There were bodies everywhere,'' said Francoise Dequeninque,
owner of a cafe next to the station. ``The nine workers working on
the track were all killed.''
   Jacques Fournier, president of the national railway, the Societe
Nationale des Chemins de Fer Francais, said the train was traveling
at 73 mph when it struck the maintenance car. The locomotive and
nine of 11 passenger cars left the rails.
   Fournier said a rarely used switch apparently had been thrown to
permit maintenance work on the track.
   Transport Minister Michel Delebarre, who visited some of the
injured at a local hospital, said an investigation would be launched.
   It was the third fatal train crash this year in France. On June
27, an incoming train crashed into a stationary train at the Gare de
Lyon station in Paris, killing 56 people. On Aug. 6, one person died
when a train crashed into a barrier at the Gare de l'Est in Paris.
   Premier Michel Rocard said in a statement that he shared the
sorrow of the victims' families and was determined to take steps to
increase safety on the nation's railways.

   A Fijian soldier of the United Nations
peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon was wounded in a shootout
Monday with Shiite Moslem militiamen, U.N. sources said.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
peacekeeper was shot in the chest during a 20-minute firefight with
six gunmen of the Syrian-backed Amal militia in Ein Baal, six miles
southeast of the southern port city of Tyre.
   The sources said the shooting broke out when soldiers manning a
Fijian checkpoint in Ein Baal tried to prevent the militiamen from
driving their green Volvo station wagon into U.N.-policed territory
with their arms.
   ``When the Fijian checkpoint told them they cannot cross, they
headed for a dirt road. A Fijian soldier fired a warning shot in the
air,'' one source said. ``The armed elements apparently thought they
were under fire, so they shot back and a firefight ensued in which
one armed element also was slightly wounded.''
   The wounded Fijian was flown by helicopter to the border town of
Naqoura for treatement at a field hospital of the U.N. Interim Force
in Lebanon, or UNIFIL, the sources said.
   They said the commands of UNIFIL and Amal launched urgent
contacts to avert repercussions.
   More than 150 UNIFIL soldiers have been killed and 250 wounded
since the deployment of the 5,800-strong force in south Lebanon in
1978.
   The force is made up of troops from France, Ireland, Sweden,
Fiji, Norway, Finland, Nepal, Ghana and Senegal.

   U.S.-mediated talks aimed at getting Cuban troops
out of Angola and bringing independence to South-West Africa are
scheduled for this weekend in Geneva, the American diplomatic
mission announced Monday.
   A statement said three days of consultations involving South
Africa, Cuba and Angola would begin Friday to prepare for formal
negotiations later in Brazzaville, capital of the Congo. No date was
given for the Brazzaville negotiations.
   U.S. delegation chief Chester A. Crocker will meet with Anatoly
Adamishin, a Soviet deputy foreign Minister, in Geneva on Thursday
and a Soviet observer will be in Geneva for the talks, the statement
said.
   South Africa, Cuba, Angola and the U.S. mediators have met
periodically since May but have not agreed on a timetable for
departure of the estimated 50,000 Cuban troops from Marxist-ruled
Angola and an independence date for South-West Africa, or Namibia,
which South Africa controls.
   The United States presented a peace plan during informal talks
Oct. 6-9 in New York.
   Details have not been publicized, but South African sources say
it calls for South Africa to begin the independence process Jan. 1,
leading to elections Aug. 1, 1989. Half the Cuban troops would leave
by Aug. 1, with the rest moving to northern Angola for a phased
withdrawal to be completed in 1990.
   South Africa has described itself as ``flexible'' on the U.S.
plan. The Cubans and Angolans have not made a public response.
   Cuba is said to want a 30-month withdrawal period instead of 24
months sought by the United States and South Africa.
   South Africa and the Cuban-Angolan forces have observed a
cease-fire since last Aug. 8 and there have been no reports of
violations.
   Anti-Marxist Angolan rebels, who have fought since independence
from Portugal in 1975, have not taken part in the talks.

<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS father's name to Slade sted Smith in 22nd graf,

<TEXT>
   Lebanese hijacking suspect Fawaz Younis was
identified in court Monday by an American college student as the
leader of ``a horde of men'' who seized a Jordanian jetliner at the
Beirut airport in 1985.
   ``I recognize him as the leader of the hijackers,'' William L.
Slade testified, pointing his finger at the bearded, black-haired
defendant seated in the courtroom.
   ``How sure are you about that?'' asked Justice Department
prosecutor Karen Morrissette.
   ``Positive,'' replied Slade, the first victim of the hijacking to
publicly identify Younis as leader of the group of five men who
stormed the Royal Jordanian airliner with AK-47 assault rifles on
June 11, 1985.
   The 21-year-old witness, testifying at a pre-trial hearing in
U.S. District Court, said he saw Younis emerge from the cockpit 10
times during two-day hijacking when the Boeing 727 jet was forced to
fly to several points in the Mediterranean before returning to
Beirut.
   ``I shook his hand at the end of the ordeal,'' Slade said,
recalling he looked the hijacker in the eye as he was leaving the
aircraft. ``I was very close to him.''
   The plane was blown up at Beirut airport shortly after the the 72
passengers and crew members were allowed to leave it.
   The aircraft was seized as it prepared to take off for Amman,
Jordan.
   ``About two minutes before takeoff, I heard a great deal of
gunfire outside the aircraft,'' Slade testified. ``A whole horde of
men stormed onto the airplane.''
   ``My gut instinct was to duck, I crouched into my chair,'' he
recalled. The group started ``beating everything in their way onto
the floor.''
   All of the hijackers, except their leader, attacked a group of
five or six Jordanian sky marshals and ``proceeded to beat them
thoroughly and torture them,'' he said.
   Slade testified that the hijacker's leader spent most of the time
in the airplane's cockpit but came back to the passenger cabin about
10 times, mostly to order his men to stop beating the sky marshals.
   When he returned to the cockpit, the hijackers ``would start
laughing and begin doing it again.'' None of the passengers was ever
beaten or threatened with violence, Slade said.
   Slade testified that he identified a photograph of the defendant
that was shown to him by an FBI agent in June 1987 _ three months
before FBI agents arrested Younis aboard a government-chartered
yacht off Cyprus.
   Younis, who is awaiting trial on hijacking charges, was lured to
the yacht by the prospect of completing a drug deal.
   The man Slade identified as the leader of the hijackers was
``dressed in a flak jacket with a black headband around his head''
and wore green pants.
   The defendant was ``heavily armed'' and wore ``a vest that
contained ammunition clips as well as hand grenades,'' Slade said.
   Slade said he could tell the man was the leader of the group
because he stayed mostly in the cockpit and was the only hijacker
who carried a two-way radio.
   Judge Barrington D. Parker called the hearing to determine
whether the eyewitness identification of Younis by Slade and five
other witnesses can be admitted into evidence.
   The trial had been scheduled to begin Nov. 14, but has been
postponed indefinitely while prosecutors appeal a pre-trial order by
the judge. Prosecutors want to challenge a ruling by Parker that
they produce classified documents and tape recordings of
conversations between Younis and an FBI informant that Parker ruled
the defense was entitled to inspect.
   A federal appeals court is not expected to consider the issue
until January, so the trial is not expected to begin until late
winter at the earliest.
   Slade, a college student, testified he was traveling with his
father, Landry Slade, a former professor at the American University
in Beirut, when the plane was hijacked. The elder Slade is also
expected to testify at the hearing, which is expected to last
several days.
   Slade, a college student, declined to say exactly where he lived,
saying: ``I'd rather not reveal that right now.''
   But he reluctantly confirmed during cross-examination by defense
lawyer Francis D. Carter that he lived in South Carolina.

<HEAD>Typical Fall Weather Forecast For Election Day</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Election Rdp Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The nation's Election Day forecast calls for
typical fall weather that one meteorologist said means should-be
voters have no excuse not to ``get out there and have at it'' at the
ballot booths.
   The National Weather Service summary for Tuesday forecast rain
showers along the Great Lakes and from western Montana across Idaho
and the Pacific Northwest. High temperatures were expected to range
from the 40s to the 80s.
   ``There's nothing terribly strong out there, no blizzards or
downpours or flooding,'' said meteorologist Dan Mullen at the
National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service.
``There's no bitter cold that might keep people in.''
   Mullen said his advice to voters was: ``Everybody get out there
and have at it.''
   Only about 50 percent or less of eligible voters were expected to
vote this year.
   High temperatures in the 40s and 50s were expected from New
England across New Jersey, over the northern Appalachians, the Great
Lakes, the upper half of the Mississippi Valley, the northern half
of the Plains, the upper Missouri Valley, the Rockies, the northern
half of the Plateau and the northern half of the Pacific Coast.
   Temperatures were expected to reach the 70s and 80s from the
southern Atlantic Coast across the Gulf of Mexico states, in Texas
except for the Panhandle, and in the inland Southwest.
   High temperatures for the remainder of the nation were forecast
to be generally in the 60s.

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses One of 16 Charges Against North</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of 16 criminal charges against former White
House aide Oliver L. North was dismissed Monday, without opposition
from the prosecution in the Iran-Contra conspiracy case.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell dismissed a charge that
North had fabricated documents to hide from investigators the fact
that arms dealer Richard V. Secord had paid for the installation of
a $13,800 security fence outside North's home in suburban Great
Falls, Va.
   The defense had contended that North could not be charged with
obstruction of justice because the alleged fabrication did not occur
while a grand jury was investigating the Iran-Contra affair.
   North was charged with fabricating the documents in December,
1986, a month before the special federal grand jury that
investigated the case was convened.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh consented to the dismissal
of the charge in a response to the defense motion.
   Gesell dismissed the charge, which carried a potential five-year
prison term and a $250,000 fine, noting the ``lack of opposition''
from prosecutors.
   But the judge denied a defense motion to dismiss a related count
charging North with illegally accepting payment for the installation
of the fence. The defense contended that the charge should only be
tried in federal court across the Potomac River in Virginia.
   North, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel and a former National
Security Council aide, is charged with conspiring to defraud the
government by illegally diverting U.S.-Iran arms-sale proceeds to
the Nicaraguan rebels.
   No date has been set for his trial or those of his four
co-defendants: former national security adviser John M. Poindexter,
Secord and arms dealer Albert Hakim.

<HEAD>U.N. Official Says Suspending Withdrawal Does Not Violate Agreement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press WRiter</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet decision to suspend its military
withdrawal from Afghanistan does not violate the U.N.-mediated
Geneva accord, the chief U.N. spokesman said Monday.
   ``The Geneva agreements are being implemented. ... At the moment,
there is no violation of the agreement,'' Francois Giuliani,
spokesman for Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, told
reporters.
   He was asked at the regular daily briefing whether Perez de
Cuellar had any comment on the Soviet announcement Friday that it
was suspending withdrawal because of Pakistani and U.S. aid to
Afghan guerrillas.
   Giuliani said: ``There is no comment because under the Geneva
agreements that is envisaged.''
   Asked to explain, he said: ``What is envisaged ... is that troops
be withdrawn by the 15th of February, 1989, and that half of them be
withdrawn by the 15th of August, and this has been done.''
   ``They have said they are suspending their troop withdrawal,''
Giuliani said. ``That is not a violation of the Geneva agreements.
... The Geneva agreements are being implemented. At the moment,
there is no violation of the agreement.''
   In its announcement Friday, the Soviet Union said it still hopes
to have its troops out by Feb. 15.
   Moslem insurgents began fighting after a Communist coup in April
1978 and Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979. An
estimated 115,000 were in the country when the withdrawal began last
May 15.
   When asked about a statement by the Soviet ambassador to
Afghanistan that the supply of arms to guerrillas by the United
States and Pakistan ``practically torpedoes'' the accords, he
replied:
   ``The secretary-general hopes and is confident that the Geneva
agreements would be implemented.''
   In an interview published Monday, Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil of
Afghanistan demanded a halt in U.S. and Pakistani aid to the Moslem
insurgents.
   Bakhtar, the official Afghan news agency, quoted him as saying:
   ``We have stated on more than one occasion that Afghanistan will
not remain indifferent to the incessant violations of the Geneva
accords. A joint Soviet-Afghan decision to suspend the withdrawal of
Soviet troops from Afghanistan was a response to it. The ...
opposition must stop the armed struggle.''
   He said new, heavier weapons brought in by the Soviets were for
defensive purposes, ``intended not for threatening anyone but for
suppressing the hotbeds of resistance of the armed opposition.''
   Sophisticated MiG-27 ground-attack jets and SS-1 Scud missiles
have been sighted in Afghanistan. The United States says their
presence raises questions of whether Moscow intends to comply with
the Geneva withdrawal agreement.
   Giuliani said Perez de Cuellar had not yet read the text of
statement the Soviet Foreign Ministry issued Friday. The Soviet
Union has criticized the 50-man U.N. observer force sent to monitor
the withdrawal and investigate possible violations by either side.
   The Soviets have asked for a report on the work of the observers,
who the Kremlin says are not doing their job.
   The agreement signed in Geneva in April by Afghanistan and
Pakistan, with the United States and Soviet Union as guarantors,
provides for troop withdrawal and non-interference in internal
affairs. The guerrillas were not a party to the negotiations and
continued to fight.
   Moscow says the arming of insurgents by Pakistan and the United
States violates the agreement. Washington says the Soviets violated
it by providing more arms to the Afghan army and introducing the new
weapons.

   A Lebanese woman shot and wounded Maj.
Gen. Antoine Lahd, a former army officer who commands Israel's
surrogate militia in south Lebanon, media reports and Israeli
spokesmen said.
   The Christian-controlled Voice of Lebanon said the woman shot
Lahd, head of the South Lebanon Army, on Monday at his home in
Marjayoun, provincial capital of Israel's self-proclaimed ``security
zone,'' an area 6 to 10 miles deep just north of the Israeli border.
   Lahd was flown by Israeli military helicopter to Rambam hospital
in the northern Israeli port of Haifa, where spokesman Zvi
Ben-Yishai said he was in stable condition and was undergoing
surgery to remove a bullet from his arm.
   ``He was hit in one of the blood vessels in the upper part of the
right arm,'' Ben-Yishai said.
   Voice of Lebanon radio, run by the rightist Christian Phalange
Party, an ally of Lahd's 2,000-man militia, identified the assailant
as Soha Bihara from Deir Mimas village in the security zone.
   Deir Mimas has a predominantly Christian population, but some
Shiite Moslems also live there.
   The Christian Lebanese Broadcasting Corp. television station in
Beirut said Ms. Bishara ``has been visiting Lahd almost daily in the
last two weeks, seeking a job. When she was walking out of his house
today, she opened her handbag, drew a pistol, turned around and shot
him.''
   It said Lahd's aides arrested the woman immediately and she was
being interrogated at his Marjayoun headquarters.
   In Israel, a military spokesman confirmed a woman shot Lahd, but
gave no details.
   Maj. Gen. Yossi Peled, head of Israel's northern command, visited
Lahd at Rambam Hospital Monday night, hospital officials said.
   Lahd, a Maronite Catholic, studied at the Ecole De Guerre in
France and Ft. Benning, Ga. He took command of the militia September
1984.
   Lahd and the SLA have been the target of Palestinian, pro-Syrian
leftist and Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem factions trying to drive
Israel from the zone established in June 1985, when it withdrew
nearly all its forces after a three-year occupotion to rout out
Palestinian guerrillas.
   Israel has about 1,000 soldiers in the zone.

   A playful Dan Quayle turned the tables on his
inquisitive press corps Monday as an often rocky campaign for the
vice presidency neared its end.
   The Republican vice presidential nominee, arriving at Dulles
International Airport to kick off his final day of campaigning,
approached reporters waiting at the stairway of his Baltimore-bound
jet.
   ``This is the last day,'' he exclaimed to a crowd poised to fire
questions at him.
   As Quayle, Secret Service agents and reporters gathered in a
circle, the senator grabbed one of the reporters and swapped places
with him, putting him in the line of fire.
   Then Quayle, scion of publishing giant Eugene Pulliam, proceeded
to play reporter:
   ``Why are you hiding out in Baltimore today?''
   ``Is this your hometown? Is that the reason you're going back to
Baltimore? Come on!''
   Quayle had been inundated in recent days with questions about his
late-stage campaign schedule that suggested George Bush's
presidential campaign was trying to hide him during the waning days
of the race for the White House.

   Iran and Iraq met for five hours Monday in their
longest face-to-face session since peace negotiations began Aug. 25,
but the Iranian delegate described it as ``long talks, no progress.''
   U.N. mediator Jan Eliasson described the encounter between Ali
Akbar Velayati and Tariq Aziz, foreign ministers of Iran and Iraq
respectively, as a ``helpful meeting'' in a ``businesslike
atmosphere.'' He said another session would be held Tuesday.
   Aziz said he would send a letter to Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar calling his attention to a statement by the
``commander of the Iranian guards'' who he said had urged that
reinforcements be sent to the front. He did not identify the
commander.
   ``We feel this statement is a very grave one,'' Aziz said. ``I
made it clear to the Iranian and the U.N. delegations that if the
Iranian side is using any threats nobody is afraid.''
   Iran and Iraq went to war in September 1980 and at least 1.5
million people were killed or wounded before a cease-fire began Aug.
20.
   Aziz said Iraq had not reinforced its positions on the 730-mile
border front but had new weapons to use ``against external
aggression.'' U.N. observers are stationed between the two armies
along the border.
   Velayati told reporters negotiations remained stuck on point one
of Security Council Resolution 598, which covers withdrawal of
forces to ``internationally recognized borders.'' The cease-fire
resolution also provides for prisoner exchange and peace
negotiations.
   In an interview with Iran's official Islamic Republic News
Agency, Velayati said no Iranian troops were left on Iraqi territory
but Iraqi forces occupy nearly 400 square miles of Iranian land.
   The southern border is the most contentious issue because it
falls in the disputed Shatt-al-Arab, Iraq's only outlet to the sea.
   Just before the war started, Iraq repudiated a 1975 treaty that
draws the line down the middle of the waterway. It wants the line
returned to the Iranian shore, as it was before the treaty.
   Iran considers the treaty still valid.
   Perez de Cuellar offered a compromise last month calling for
military disengagement and exchange of the estimated 100,000
prisoners, combined with dredging of the Shatt-al-Arab and an
Iranian pledge to stop searching ships in the Persian Gulf for
war-related cargo.
   The waterway, which Iran calls the Arvan River, is blocked by
ships stranded by the war, unexploded shells and silt that collected
during eight years.
   An IRNA dispatch from Geneva quoted Velayati as saying the U.N.
mediators must produce new ideas ``if they want the talks to move
ahead and out of the current relative deadlock.''

   FERE-EN-TARDENOIS, France (AP) _ Peace talks among Cambodian
factions made no substantial progress Monday but the leaders agreed
to meet again and to establish a working committee of their
representatives, officials reported.
   The talks in this village 70 miles east of Paris are to end
Tuesday.
   Attending the conference are neutralist Prince Norodom Sihanouk,
leader of a loose alliance of three resistance groups fighting the
Vietnamese-installed Cambodian government; anti-communist Son Sann
and communist Premier Hun Sen of Cambodia.
   The fourth Cambodian faction, the Communist Khmer Rouge, had been
invited but the three other leaders rejected the Khmer Rouge's
proposed envoy, Ok Saukun who is Cambodia's ambassador to the U.N.
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. They said he was
not qualified for a ``summit'' meeting.
   The three agreed to meet again in France early next year.
   The resistance groups fighting the government are Sihanouk's
supporters, Son Sann's guerrillas and the Khmer Rouge.
   Prince Norodom Ranariddh, Sihanouk's son and spokesman, said Hun
Sen's position had hardened. He said the Cambodian government wanted
to link the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops to an end to foreign aid
to the resistance groups.
   Son Sann and Sihanouk said the withdrawal of Vietnam's military
forces from Cambodia must take place before any aid to the
resistance is ended.
   ``It is unacceptable to put the foreign occupation of Cambodia
and the just resistance of the people on the same level,'' Ranariddh
told reporters. ``We will not compromise.''
   Another main point of disagreement is the dismantling of the
Cambodian regime. It was installed by the Vietnamese after they
invaded Cambodia in Decemer 1978 and ousted the Khmer Rouge that had
defeated the U.S.-backed government in 1975 at the end of the
Indochinese war. Hundreds of thousands of Cambodians perished during
the brutal Khmer Rouge effort to destroy all opposition and create a
rural society.
   Sihanouk is demanding the Hun Sen government be replaced by a
four-party administration. Hun Sen has indicated the status quo be
maintained until ``free and democratic elections'' can be held.
   Sihanouk and Son Sann believe that no agreement will work that
leaves out the Khmer Rouge, which has the strongest military force
in the resistance. Hun Sen's position is that the Khmer Rouge must
first be disarmed to avoid another civil war.
   ``On these essential points divergences remain,'' said Ranariddh.

   A powerful earthquake struck just inside China's
mountainous southern border, and two official radio stations
reported Monday that 600 people were killed.
   Radio Beijing and the Peoples' Central Broadcasting Station
quoted the same reporter, Hu Jiaqi, about the death toll. Radio
Beijing also quoted him as saying most of the dead were in Shanmato,
a village in Yunnan province that was nearly wiped out by the
earthquake, which registered 7.6 on the Richter scale.
   Hu's account could not be confirmed independently. An earlier
Radio Beijing report said total casualties were 600, including dead
and injured.
   The State Seismology Bureau in Beijing, which had reported 18
killed and 54 injured, said it had no new figures. Dispatches from
the official news agency Xinhua said at least 37 people were dead
and more than 100 injured.
   No telephone service was available to the affected part of Yunnan
province near the Burmese border. It is sparsely inhabited by
farmers, many from the Lahu and Va minorities with their own
languages and live in houses of wood and mud.
   A Yunnan official reached by telephone said the provincial
government had no idea how many people were killed. Asked whether
600 was a plausible, he said: ``It might be. It might not be.''
   If the death toll of 600 is accurate, this would be China's worst
earthquake since the 1976 tremor that hit the northeastern city of
Tangshan. Officials say 242,000 died, but unofficial estimates put
the death toll as high as 800,000.
   That quake measured 7.8 to 8.2 on the Richter scale, a gauge of
the energy released by an earthquake. Each number on the scale
indicates a tenfold increase in strength and a temblor of 7 can
cause heavy damage in populated areas.
   Following Sunday's quake, the State Seismology Bureau said dozens
of aftershocks had struck the Yunnan region through Monday night,
with the strongst measuring 7.2 but most ranging from 4.0 to 6.0.
   Roads to the affected area were cut and Yunnan authorities
ordered an airlift of food, medicine and other relief supplies. The
provincial government said early Tuesday that doctors had set out
for the area and the governor, He Zhiqiang, was en route.
   Xinhua said the national Communist Party Central Committee
ordered a delegation led by State Councilor Song Jian to visit the
site and oversee rescue work. It said Premier Li Peng issued a
statement expressing sympathy and concern for victims and their
families.
   The quake was centered in Yunnan's Lancang and Menglian counties,
about 240 miles southwest of the provincial capital Kunming. Xinhua
said most houses in the two counties were demolished and buildings
were destroyed in 14 surrounding counties.
   Roads to the region were cut but crews were working to repair
them, the agency said.
   A journalist who has visited the region said many homes were
built on stilts because of periodic heavy rains and probably would
collapse in such a strong earthquake.
   Seismologists in Kunming reported no damage in the city of 1.5
million. Three years ago, a quake of 6.3 on the Richter scale killed
22 people and injured 300 in Kunming.
   A quake of 5.0 occured Oct. 15 in southern Yunnan, which
experiences tremors frequently, but there were no reports of
casualties. A powerful temblor hit far western China on Saturday and
seismologists said they did not know whether the Yunnan quake was
related to it.
   The Saturday tremor, measuring 7.0 on the Richter scale, was
centered in an uninhabited area of the Tanggula Mountains in western
Qinghai province and northern Tibet. Officials in Qinghai said they
had no reports of casualties.
   China is one of the most earthquake-prone countries and
seismologists predicted in 1985 that activity would increase through
the end of the century. The last major quake was on Aug. 23, 1985,
when a temblor of 7.4 killed 71 people and injured 125 in the
far-western Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

<HEAD>Reagan Signs $1.2 Billion Homeless Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan signed legislation Monday
authorizing a two-year, $1.2 billion program for the homeless,
saying it would permit the government to ``address effectively the
plight of those who do not have shelter.''
   The bill authorizes $633.8 million for the current fiscal year
and $675.8 million for the fiscal year that will begin next Oct. 1.
   ``It ensures that the federal government, directly and through
cooperative efforts with state and local governments and the private
sector, can address effectively the plight of those who do not have
shelter,'' the president said.
   Funds are authorized for the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
which aids the work of non-profit organizations and local
governments in providing shelter, food and other services. Money
also will go to the Department of Housing and Urban Development for
grants for renovation of buildings for use as emergency shelters and
for their operation.
   ``The act authorizes funds for a program of particular importance
that serves both the medical needs of the homeless and the national
objective of a drug-free America,'' Reagan said. He said he referred
to a Department of Health and Human Services program of grants to
public or private nonprofit organizations for health and substance
abuse services for the homeless.
   The act expands the job Training Partnership Act to assist
individuals in developing marketable skills, the president said.
   The measure amends legislation initially sponsored by the late
Rep. Stewart McKinney, R-Conn.

   Black leaders expressed confidence Monday that
blacks would turn out to vote in large numbers, despite a
presidential campaign widely regarded as lackluster.
   They predicted get-out-the-vote efforts by Democrat Jesse
Jackson, black churches and other organizations will produce a
tunout as large or nearly as large as in 1984, when blacks turned
out in record numbers.
   Many analysts are predicting the overall turnout Tuesday will be
less than the 53 percent of American adults who cast their ballots
in 1984, and some believe blacks will not turn out for Dukakis as
strongly as they did for Walter Mondale, who got 90 percent of the
black vote in 1984.
   Blacks make up 11.1 percent of the adult population and have
voted overwhelmingly Democratic since the New Deal.
   Curtis Gans, executive director of the Committee for the Study of
the American Electorate, said registration is down among blacks and
``I can't conceive of black turnout not being lower than in '84.''
   Stephen Hess, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said
black voters in 1984 ``had a feeling of affection'' for Walter
Mondale. ``I don't see that they feel that way for Michael
Dukakis,'' he said. ``He was the fellow who beat their man
(Jackson).''
   Many Jackson supporters were upset last July when Dukakis failed
to notify Jackson beforehand that he had chosen Lloyd Bentsen of
Texas for his running mate.
   But Jackson has crisscrossed the country on behalf of the
Dukakis-Bentsen ticket, logging 55,700 miles and addressing 745,000
people in 191 events in 29 states, according to Frank Watkins, a
Jackson spokesman.
   John E. Jacob, president of the National Urban League, said, ``I
think Jesse has done everything he could to say to black America
that he is not mad about that, and even if he were, that the states
are still too high for that to be a reason for blacks not going to
the polls.''
   Jacob predicted the black vote will be at least as large as it
was in 1984. ``There has been a tremendous amount of work going on
around the country on the part of the black infrastructure _ black
churches, black community organizations _ that is not getting
visible media attention,'' he said.
   The Rev. Benjamin L. Hooks, executive director of the NAACP,
said, ``We've had a fairly unexciting campaign in turning people on
to vote.''
   ``There was a period when many black people felt let down,'' said
Hooks, but he added that grassroots get-out-the-vote efforts and
Jackson's constant campaigning have turned that around.
   ``I think that black voter turnout will be substantial, but
perhaps not as large as it could have been had there been more
coverage of issues and of Jesse Jackson,'' said Hooks. He predicted
it would be ``very close to the '84 turnout.''
   Hooks said that in states with significant black populations,
``wherever Dukakis is running a tight race with Bush in the white
community, black voters ... could be the deciding factor.''
   Pollster Gordon S. Black said his organization, which conducts
polls for USA Today and Cable News Network, found no evidence in its
final pre-election survey of any likely drop in black turnout.
   After interviewing nearly 700 blacks in a survey group of 6,613,
Black said, ``we have absolutely no evidence that there's a (black)
turnout drop at all.''

   Sikh gunmen shot and killed an Indian
army general in Punjab state Monday, police said. Five days of Sikh
separatist violence left at least 79 people dead in the northern
Indian state.
   Maj. Gen. B.N. Kumar, a Hindu, was shot in the head by two Sikh
gunmen as he left his home in Chandigarh to go to his office, a
police spokesman said.
   The assailants, who were waiting in a car, fired 40 to 45 rounds
and escaped, said the spokesman, who under regulations cannot be not
identified.
   Kumar, 56, was serving on the Bhakra Beas Management Board, which
overlooks the work of the Bhakra Nangal Dam. The dam, one of the
largest in the world, is in neighboring Himachal Pradesh state but
provides irrigation water for a vast area of Punjab.
   Bhakra Nangal is 93 miles northeast of Chandigarh.
   The motive behind the killing was not immediately known, but
several sources said Sikh radicals had vowed to kill officers of the
board. The radicals have accused the board of suddenly releasing
water from the dam in September without any advance warning, causing
floods.
   Kumar denied the charge Oct. 17 in a statement issued in
Chandigarh.
   At least 702 people died and 192 are still missing in the floods
that forced tens of thousands of people out of their homes.
   Sikh radicals are campaigning for an independent Sikh homeland in
Punjab, claiming they are discriminated against by the Hindus,
India's religious majority, and need a way to maintain their
cultural and religious traditions.
   Sikhs account for only two percent of India's 880 million people,
while the Hindus make up about 82 percent. However, Sikhs are a
majority in Punjab.
   On Thursday, Sikh radicals ambushed a bus and killed 11 people in
Gujarpura. On Friday, they exploded seven bombs in a crowded market
in Batala, killing 28 people and wounding 50 others.
   Also Friday, a group of Sikh gunmen attacked a seed farm near
Lawdohwal, killing 20 Hindus. In other attacks, Sikh radicals killed
14 people across the state on late Friday and Saturday.
   On Sunday, Sikh radicals killed five people in the state.

<HEAD>Drug, Safety Concerns Arise At USX Plant After Steelyard Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAIRLESS HILLS, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Questions about safety and drug use
linger at the USX Corp. Fairless Works, where last month a crane
operator suffocated after a plunge into a bin of iron-ore pellets
the size of jelly beans.
   The Bucks County district attorney's office and U.S. Occupational
Safety and Health Adminstration are investigating the Oct. 2 death
of R.B. Townsend, 52, of Levittown.
   USX reportedly hired nine undercover agents to probe alleged drug
use at the suburban Philadelphia plant.
   Stanley G. Martin has testified he pressed the button that
dropped Townsend into a funnel filled with the iron-ore pellets. The
funnel opens from the bottom into a car that transfers ore to a
blast-furnace bin.
   Martin, 28, had been on the job just four days at the time of the
accident.
   ``It's not a whodunit,'' District Attorney Alan Rubenstein said.
``We know how it happened and who was responsible. The only question
that remains is, `Is it criminal?'''
   The answer depends on whether illegal drugs contributed directly
to the fatality.
   A test found trace amounts of cocaine and marijuana in Martin
three hours after the accident, too little to prove he was
criminally impaired, Rubenstein said. A second review of the test
results is under way.
   Martin contends the fatality was simply a horrible accident
caused by a confusing situation in an unfamiliar environment. He had
only had two hours of supervised training for the job.
   Townsend had stepped from his cab to clean the windows, standing
on iron-ore pellets to reach the glass, USX announced in a statement
the day after the accident. He had asked Martin, who operated the
transfer cars, not to dump the funnel until he was finished, The
Philadelphia Inquirer said in Monday editions.
   The newspaper said Martin testified during dismissal hearings
that he either forgot or misunderstood the request.
   Tom Farrell, a spokesman for USX, declined comment Monday on the
nature of the dismissal hearings or whether Martin is still employed
at Fairless Works.
   ``We're basically taking a pass on all this questioning, because
we have an ongoing investigation there,'' Farrell said.
   According to the Inquirer, Martin checked ``yes'' on an
application when asked if he had ever used drugs. The form then
asked ``What kind?'' Martin wrote: ``Pot.''
   OSHA will determine whether USX management was responsible for
the fatality, said Ed Skladitis, director of the Philadelphia-area
OSHA office.
   The questions the agency will answer include whether USX hired a
man who should have been rejected, whether he received proper
training and whether safe procedures existed for the window cleaning.
   OSHA has the power to levy fines when it finds negligence.
   Since the death, the company has given crane operators
instructions on how to clean their cabs safely and has issued
padlocks to lock the bottom of the funnel before windows are cleaned.
   Farrell said USX has an ongoing safety program at Fairless, and
changes are made whenever investigation of an accident determines a
cause that can be remedied.

   Shane O'Neil ignored the blinding lights of
television cameras and passed his oral English and civics tests with
flying red-white-and-blue colors Monday, becoming the first amnesty
recipient in West Texas to earn permanent U.S. residency.
   The 31-year-old San Angelo ranchhand, wearing a blue bandana
around his neck and clanking spurs on his dusty boots, calmly
recited the colors of the U.S. flag, explained what the flag's 13
stripes symbolize, told how many states are in the union, identified
Ronald Reagan as the president and defined the Constitution as the
supreme law of the land.
   After filling out a short test with similar questions and having
his fingerprints taken, the Yugoslavian was given his permanent
residency card.
   ``I wasn't scared of ... any questions,'' O'Neil said as he gazed
at the card. ``It's just exciting, I guess, getting something like
this. It's liberty for me.''
   Joining O'Neil as first-day permanent residency recipients were
Juan Helguera Segovia and Feliciana Gutierrez.
   All three entered the United States illegally and were among the
first in line in May 1987 to apply for amnesty from deportation
under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. That allowed
them to be among the first to apply for permanent residency under
the second phase of the amnesty program.
   All three entered the United States for different reasons and all
three qualified for permanent residency under different criteria.
   O'Neil, who took that name after he got to the United States 15
years ago, refused to divulge the name he was born with. He said he
was born in a town about 25 miles from Belgrade called Golubinci
Stara Pazova.
   At 16, he joined the merchant marine and got work aboard a ship
that cruised up the St. Lawrence Seaway to Chicago. He got off the
ship in Chicago and never got back on.
   ``I left for political reasons,'' he said. ``I believe in
liberty, and I've always believed in God. I'm Catholic.''
   Helguera, a well-service worker in Odessa, got permanent
residency by showing that he had taken English and civics classes at
Odessa College. The 28-year-old native of Durango, Mexico, came to
the United States nine years ago to seek work.
   ``In the nine years, they (the Border Patrol) stopped me only
once,'' he said. ``They gave me 15 days to leave, but I didn't
leave.''
   His wife, Dolores, said she plans to apply for permanent
residency in a few months, when she becomes eligible.
   Mrs. Gutierrez moved to El Paso with her daughter, Ofelia Haller,
in 1978. The 88-year-old native of Hidalgo de Parral, Mexico, was
exempt from the English and civics requirement because of her age.
   ``I'm glad and very thankful,'' she said of getting permanent
residency.
   All three said they plan to apply for citizenship. O'Neil, a
staunch supporter of the Republican Party, seemed the most eager to
become a citizen. Because he is married to an American citizen, he
most likely will be able to vote for president in 1992.
   Asked if he wished he could vote in the 1988 presidential
election, O'Neil said: ``Oh, you bet, of course. I sure hope Mr.
Bush will win tomorrow.''

<HEAD>Ask Action Against Slovenian President For Remarks in US</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Communist-led mass organization
said Monday the president of the Slovenian republic should be
punished for allegedly anti-Serbian statements he made on a visit to
the United States.
   Action against Janez Stanovnik should be taken by the nation's
highest ruling bodies, the collective federal presidency and the
Communist Party Presidium, said a statement from the Belgrade
Socialist Alliance carried by the official news ageny Tanjug.
   In remarks last Wednesday to the National Press Club in
Washington, Stanovnik said protests inspired by inflation and
Serbian nationalism a month ago had threatened the stability of
Yugoslavia.
   Mass rallies in Serbia, the nation's largest republic, involved
hundreds of thousands of people supporting Serbian party chief
Slobodan Milosevic's campaign for more control over Kosovo and
Vojvodina, two largely autonomous provinces that are part of Serbia.
   The Belgrade Socialist Alliance, which is strongly influenced by
Milosevic's policies, said Stanovnik misinformed the American public
and his views ``differed from reality.'' Belgrade is the capital of
both Serbia and Yugoslavia.
   Stanovnik said in Washington the possibility of ethnic
disturbances crossing into the republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina, a
fragile mixture of Moslem, Catholic and Christian Orthodox faiths,
prompted him and leaders of other republics to act through the
national party on matters normally reserved for regional authorities.
   He said the crisis had been eased by events that included
decisions by the national Communist Party Central Committee late
last month.
   ``Two weeks ago, you would have asked, `When does the civil war
come?'' Stanovnik said in the United States. He had gone there on a
private visit to his son in Philadelphia.
   A critical commentary published Sunday by the Belgrade daily
Politika, which is controlled by Milosevic's group, said Stanovnik
``disinformed the international public about events in his own
country, frightening it with imaginary Serbian nationalism.''
   Tanjug quoted the Belgrade Socialist Alliance as saying it would
demand that ``the presidency of Yugoslavia and the Communist Party
Presidium adopt an official stand on the statements made by the
President of Slovenia Janez Stanovnik in the United States.''

<HEAD>Lawyer Accused of Providing Sensitive Information to BBC</HEAD>

   A lawyer appeared in court Monday charged
with violating national emergency laws by providing sensitive
military and political information to a foreign news agency, Burmese
state radio reported.
   It said Nay Min, 42, gave the information, described by the
broadcast as ``false rumors,'' to the British Broadcasting Corp.
   Nay Min also is accused of defaming the government and inciting
unrest. If convicted he could be sentenced to a maximum of seven
years in prison.
   The broadcast did not give any deatils of Nay Min's court
appearance but said the hearing was adjourned until Nov. 21.
   Nay Min was arrested at his home in Rangoon on Oct. 21. after
providing sensitive information by telephone to a BBC correspondent
based in Dhaka, Bangladesh, according to the report.
   It said the lawyer, who reportedly used the codename ``Eastern
Star,'' also made telephone calls to London on a regular basis.
   Nay Min was not an accredited BBC correspondent, the broadcast
said.
   Burma went through months of violent street demonstrations by
people demanding democratic reforms until Gen. Saw Maung seized
power in a military coup on Sept. 18.
   More than 450 people have been killed as Saw Maung's security
forces cracked down on anti-government protests.

   Nicaraguan guerrillas will demand
that the U.S. president-elect quickly reveal whether he will support
their struggle to overthrow the Sandinista government, a rebel
leader said Monday.
   Wilfredo Montalvan, a member of the directorate of the rebels'
Nicaraguan Resistance organization, also said the rebels hope to
obtain renewed U.S. military aid if Vice President George Bush is
elected president on Tuesday.
   ``We will meet with the transition team of the new (U.S.)
president and demand a clear definition over Nicaragua,'' Montalvan
said by telephone from Miami.
   The right-wing rebels, known as Contras, want ``to determine if
the new government of either Bush or (Democratic candidate Michael)
Dukakis will continue to support the war to defeat once and for all
the Sandinista government,'' he said.
   The Reagan administration has backed the rebels, known as
Contras, since 1981 in their bid to overthrow the leftist
Sandinistas. The majority of the Contras fled Nicaragua in recent
months to Honduras after U.S. military aid expired in February.
   The Contras currently are drawing from a $27 million humanitarian
aid package approved by the U.S. Congress.
   Montalvan said the Contras would reject U.S. military aid if it
is provided only to pressure the Sandinista government into making
democratic reforms.
   ``We cannot allow our people to continue to sacrifice themselves
just to keep pressure on the Sandinistas. That is immoral,'' he said.
   The Sandinistas and rebels signed a cease-fire pact in March.
President Daniel Ortega has extended the cease-fire on a monthly
basis through the end of November, while the Contras say the
cease-fire is indefinite.
   Each side accuses the other of truce violations. Talks on a
permanent truce stalemated in September.
   Montalvan said Contra directors will be in El Salvador when the
foreign ministers of member nations of the Organization of American
States meet there Nov. 15.
   Contra leaders will present evidence of Sandinista violations of
the August 1987 Central American peace accord to the foreign
ministers, he said.

<HEAD>One-day Strike Disrupts Government Offices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of civil servants struck for one
day Monday to protest dismissal of union workers at an intelligence
headquarters, disrupting such government offices as welfare and
driving-test centers.
   Neil Kinnock, leader of the opposition Labor Party, told a mass
rally of civil servants in London: ``We believe that solidarity,
like liberty, must be indivisible. And we believe that solidarity,
like charity, begins at home.''
   The rally was one of about 60 held to protest the firings of five
men at the Government Communications Headquarters, a huge facility
at Cheltenham in southwest England that monitors transmissions from
the Soviet Union. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher says its work is
too sensitive to risk disruption by strikes.
   In London, Kinnock greeted 2,500 civil servants in Polish and
said: ``I do it in that way because we have solidarity with the
belief that the freedoms of organization, assembly and expression
must know no boundaries.
   ``We don't just want freedom in Gdansk, we want it in GCHQ. We
don't just want dialogue and freedom to choose in Poland, we want it
in Cheltenham.''
   Mrs. Thatcher visited Poland last week and met with Lech Walesa,
founder of the outlawed independent union movement Solidarity.
   After Labor made the comparison again later Monday, in
Parliament, Civil Service Minister Richard Luce responded: ``Don't
you understand the difference between true democracy, with freedom
under the law, with a freely elected parliament?
   ``National security has to come first, and the GCHQ needs to
operate on a continuous basis if they are to be effective.''
   The five men were fired for flouting a 1984 ban on unions at the
facility. Twelve other men face retirement, compulsory transfer or
dismissal.
   They were the holdouts among one-third of the 7,000 employees who
were union members in 1984. Others accepted payment of 1,000 pounds
each (then worth $1,400) for quitting their union.
   None of the rebels was fired until this year, but union officials
said the government tried to freeze them out with such tactics as
refusing pay raises.
   The Council of Civil Service Unions, an umbrella for Britain's
eight civil service unions, said ``80 percent-plus walkouts'' closed
many employment and welfare offices, state-run job and driving-test
centers.
   Civil servants also walked off jobs in customs offices, prisons,
airports and magistrate courts, and spokeswoman Anne Kenefeck said:
``We're thinking 200,000 is not a bad estimate'' for the number of
strikers.

   FORT WAYNE, Ind. (A ) _ Sen. Dan Quayle, ``finally at home'' in
his native Indiana, got a hero's welcome Monday night as he
concluded an occasionally rocky campaign for the vice presidency.
   In a boisterous rally that took on the flavor of a political
convention, Quayle, thanked a crowd of about 2,000 for supporting
him through times of tribulation.
   ``There have been weeks of wild exhilaration along with personal
testing, and we knew you were there,'' Quayle said, without
referring specifically to the controversy that swirled about him in
the days following his Aug. 17 nomination by the Republican National
Convention to be George Bush's running mate.
   ``My fellow Hoosiers, I am finally at home,'' he said. ``It is
here, with your help, that I entered public service.''
   Quayle had been besieged by questions from news organizations
about the circumstances surrounding his enlistment in the Indiana
National Guard at the height of the Vietnam war in 1969 and the
question of whether he benefited by undue influence in getting
admitted into the Indiana University law school with a ``C'' average
on undergraduate work at Depauw University.
   Earlier, Quayle said Americans must ``say good night'' to
Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis if they want to
save the changes wrought during President Reagan's eight years in
office.
   During a rally at an aiport hangar in Roanoke, Va., nestled in
the Blue Ridge Mountains, he declared: ``Let me say to the citizens
of Virginia: Michael Dukakis is not on your side.''
   The 41-year-old Indiana senator, confident about the GOP ticket's
election prospects Tuesday, told reporters he was satisfied with the
way he handled his role as George Bush's vice presidential running
mate and is ready for the voters' verdict.
   Borrowing a slogan used by Virginia's tourist industry, Quayle
said Dukakis ``knows that Virginia is for lovers, not liberals.''
   Quayle mocked Dukakis' populist ``on your side'' campaign theme.
``He's on your back,'' the senator said. ``He's in your pocket. And
on Tuesday night, he's out of luck. And that's when we'll be saying,
`Say good night, Mike'.''
   Touring a Westinghouse electronics plant near Baltimore earlier,
Quayle told reporters the Republican ticket had ``a really good
shot'' in heavily Democratic Maryland, ``and if we can win Maryland,
we're gonna be well on our way to victory come this Tuesday.''
   ``It's been an exhilarating campaign,'' Quayle said, ``but it's
time to come to an end and let the people make their decision.''
   He told reporters he was pleased with his campaign role, which he
saw as a ``lightning rod'' for attacks by Dukakis and his running
mate, Lloyd Bentsen.
   ``Actually, that's part of our strategy,'' Quayle said. ``We want
them to attack the vice presidential candidate and to leave George
Bush alone. We want George Bush to go out and be able to speak to
the people.''
   ``He's running for president, and all the fire they want to
direct at me _ we're delighted,'' Quayle said.
   He ducked a question whether he was concerned about polls
suggesting that voters have lingering doubts about his fitness for
the vice presidency.
   ``The true test is, how does George Bush do in the election,''
Quayle replied. ``That's the only test I'm interested in.''

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The army's representative on the ruling
four-man junta resigned Monday and his replacement was named, as
part of changes wrought by President Augusto Pinochet in the
military branch that is the backbone of his power.
   Pinochet, the army's commander, accepted the resignation of Gen.
Humberto Gordon from the junta, said a statement issued by army
headquarters. No reason was given for the resignation.
   Gordon, 61, served on the junta since December 1986.
   Hours later, another communique announced thar Gen. Santiago
Sinclair, 58, an officer noted for his fervent personal loyalty to
Pinochet, had been picked by the 72-year-old president to replace
Gordon.
   The move apparently prompted the retirement of Gen. Bruno
Siebert, public works minister and a Pinochet loyalist, who had more
seniority than Sinclair. Although leving the army, Siebert woul kept
his Cabinet post, the government said.
   Until last week, Sinclair had been the army's deputy
commander-in-chief, the man who handles the day-to-day business in
the service, as Pinochet devotes most of his time to the presidency.
   Sinclair was replaced by Gen. Jorge Zincke, 54, considered less a
hardliner than this predecessor.
   Last week, Pinochet reshuffled the highest ranks of his army,
sending 13 generals into retirement. He also promoted 10 brigadiers
to the rank of general.
   The junta also includes the commanders-in-chief of the navy, air
force and national police. It has served as a legislature in the
absence of a congress, which was disbanded when Pinochet seized
power in a bloody 1973 military coup that ousted the elected leftist
government of Salvador Allende.
   Pinochet last month lost a referendum in which citizens refused
to extend his rule to 1997 and voted for a transition to democracy.
   Elections for a civilian congress and a successor to Pinochet are
scheduled for December 1989.
   Since the 1973 coup, the army's representative on the junta has
changed four times. The navy's representative, Adm. Jose Merino, has
been a junta member since the coup.

   Snow fell on Upper Michigan and across west central Minnesota
into southeastern North Dakota on Monday, but much of the nation has
fair weather.
   Snowshowers extended from southern New York state into northern
Pennsylvania, becoming rainshowers from central Pennsylvania and the
lower Great Lakes into central New England.
   Winter weather also has a firm grip on part of the Northwest,
with a snow advisory posted through Tuesday for the higher
elevations of the Washington Cascades
   One inch of snow fell at Fargo, N.D., and Mount Washington, N.H.,
during the 6 hours ending at 1 pm EST.
   Temperatures were warmer than normal over much of Texas, with
Fort Worth reaching 88 degrees, a tie for their 1963 record for the

   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 32
degrees at Houghton and Marquette, Mich., to 90 degrees at Junction,
Texas. The low temperature for the nation Monday was 12 degrees at
Lake Yellowstone, Wyo.
   The national weather forecast for Tuesday called for rain
extending along the Great Lakes and from western Montana across
Idaho and the Pacific Northwest.
   High temperatures will be in the 40s and 50s from New England
across New Jersey, over the northern Appalachians, Great Lakes, the
upper half of the Mississippi Valley, the northern half of the
Plains, upper Missouri Valley, the Rockies and the northern half of
the Pacific Coast.
   Temperatures will reach the 70s and 80s from the southern
Atlantic Coast across the Gulf of Mexico states, Texas except for
its Panhandle, and the inland Southwest. High temperatures over the
remainder of the nation will generally be in the 60s.

   George Bush sent his case to the voters Monday, leading in the
polls as he pledged a ``steady hand'' to build on the
accomplishments of the Reagan years. Michael Dukakis campaigned into
overtime, vowing a ``November surprise'' that would land him in the
White House.
   Some polls suggested Bush's support might be eroding as both men
raced across America in a final-day search for votes. Both campaigns
spent nearly $1 million apiece on competing half-hour appeals on
network television, and the vice president also aired a new
five-minute commercial that sharply attacked his Democratic rival.
   ``It's in the hands of the gods and the American people,'' the
vice president said before heading for Houston and the final rally
of his candidacy.
   ``I'm going to do my best to be a fine president and a good
leader and somebody you can be proud of,'' Dukakis said in the
closing commercial of his campaign.
   ``No retreat baby, no surrender,'' said Democratic running mate
Lloyd Bentsen, echoing rock star Bruce Springsteen.
   Dukakis was on a 48-hour campaign blitz through 8,500 miles that
wouldn't end until election morning in Boston. He told a crowd of
20,000 in California that Democrats would kick Bush ``right out of
our future'' _ and then flew off into the night.
   Democrats expressed confidence they would command majorities in
the 101st Congress that will govern alongside the new president.
They also angled for modest gains in the dozen statehouse races on
Tuesday's ballot.
   Both presidential campaigns relied on their 30-minute network
commercials to reach the millions of voters that the pollsters said
hadn't yet chosen a candidate with certainty.

   Bush's blended snippets of biography, family tenderness and
praise from Reagan with a final taped appeal from the vice
president. ``Americans are better off that they were eight years
ago, and if you elect me president you will be better off four years
from now than you are today,'' he said.
   He paid tribute to his rival, but said he was a man without
experience in national security affairs.
   ``I can say that I believe I have the experience to be a steady
hand guiding our country,'' he said.

   The Massachusetts governor's commercial was a similar blend of
speech-making and images from the campaign trail and bosom of his
family.
   It showed him fielding questions on issues that have plagued him
all campaign long, including his record on crime, the environment
and his relunctance to respond to the negative attacks.
   He said in reply that he had a record of achievement on crime and
Bush didn't.
   He criticized Bush's call for a capital gains tax cut and said it
would benefit the wealthy at the expense of everyone else.
   ``Now who is going to pay for that tax break. Look beside you.
Look behind you. Look in the mirror and ask yourself, is George Bush
on your side?''
   The final day of America's longest, costliest and _ some said _
nastiest presidential campaign left little room for subtlety.
   Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen appeared on
stage in Texas with a caged quail _ an obvious dig at his Republican
rival, Dan Quayle.
   Bush threw a stinging jab at Dukakis, saying, ``We don't want to
return to my opponent's favorite song: `For all you do, this
recession is for you.'''
   Nor was there anything complicated about Dukakis' final day as a
candidate _ an exercise in sleep deprivation that Barbara Bush
agreed was ``brutal.''

<HEAD>Bush Does His Farewell `Thing'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush poked some kind and
gentle fun at himself and the media traveling with him, giving them
a recorded farewell message.
   In the message, played aboard the media jet, Bush used a string
of his well-worn campaign slogans and the stump-speech lines
reporters know by heart.
   The tape was played as Bush and the press charter flew to his
adopted home state of Texas for election day from his final campaign
stop in St. Louis.
   ``We've come a long way together,'' he said. ``We've solved the
vision thing. You never use the `W' word around me any more.'' He
was referring to his tendency to use `thing' as a catchall word and
the `wimp' label that dogged him early in the campaign.
   He said he he knew reporters had worked long and hard hours away
from their homes and families to cover him.
   ``I've seen you rushing with the cameras and the mikes when I
unexpectedly walk one way instead of another,'' he said. ``And I've
seen all this and looked at you and thought: `Tough, too bad, who
cares. It's your problem, get a raise. Get a real job, get a
haircut.'

   Twenty-nine homeless people protesting a lack
of housing were arrested across from the Liberty Bell on Monday when
they tried to occupy a federal office building and an adjoining
courthouse.
   Nearly 50 men and women, a few holding children, sought to enter
the William Green Federal Building on the edge of Independence
National Historic Park.
   Group members said they planned to sit-in at the ninth floor
offices of U.S. Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., and set up a temporary
homeless shelter, but they were barred at the main entrance, and a
scuffle ensued.
   Two federal policemen were pushed to the ground but were not
injured.
   Federal marshals and building police brought out 3-foot riot
sticks and plexiglass shields and massed in front of the inside
lobby. The equipment was never used.
   Protestors then circled the building, to the courthouse side,
where only people with a government ID card or who could show they
had business inside were allowed in.
   The protesters distributed leaflets that demanded the government
restore $25 billion for housing programs that was cut from the
federal budget.
   Peter Coles, director of the federal security officers, said his
plan was to keep the building open for business but to prevent any
occupation _ and he ordered all but two doors left open so people
could get in or out.
   The chants outside increased _ ``What do we want? Houses. When do
we want them? Now'' _ and the demonstrators, some locking hands in a
tight chain, began pushing and shoving, Cole ordered all the doors
locked inside.
   Outside the demonstrators chained the doors shut.
   Hundreds of federal workers, jurors and attorneys blocked from
going to lunch crowded into the cafeteria on the second floor of the
Green building. Others who got out had to use the basement garage
entrance to get back in.
   That's when U.S. Attorney Michael Bayleson, on behalf of the
General Services Administration, went to U.S. District Judge Edward
Cahn who issued ``under the urgent circumstances'' a temporary
restraining order directing that those blocking the doors provide a
path for people to get in and out.
   When the protestors refused to budge, federal marshals and local
police moved in and carried 29 people to vans that took them to a
federal detention center in the courthouse basement.
   All were later released on their own recognizance and ordered to
appear for hearings.
   Last week, seven people were arrested at a sit-in at Heinz's
Washington office.

   New York City on Monday began a pilot program to
stem the spread of AIDS by providing drug addicts new hypodermic
needles in exchange for their used ones.
   Only two men appeared at Health Department headquarters in lower
Manhattan to get the needles although the program, which is aimed at
reducing needle sharing among addicts, is intended to serve as many
as 200 intravenous drug abusers.
   ``Today, we're going to have only a handful,'' said health
commissioner Dr. Stephen Joseph. ``We're going to build slowly up''
over a period of weeks or months, he predicted.
   Under the $240,000 program, which has drawn heated opposition
from conservatives and some minority group organizations, addicts
also will receive counseling on AIDS and drugs. Another 200 addicts
will receive only counseling; over time, their rate of infection
will be compared with the infection rate of those receiving needles.
   The program is open only to addicts over age 18 who have applied
for drug treatment and been denied immediate admission to the city's
overcrowded programs.
   Anyone wishing to apply Monday had to locate a small room down a
first-floor corridor marked ``Employees Only.'' No sign announced
the location of the room, and applicants had to ask for directions
and pass several police officers to reach the program's office.
   Applicants would be asked to fill out a consent form, learn about
the program and take a blood test. They would receive a kit
including a condom, sterile water and pamphlets about safe sex and
needle hygiene.
   An addict who tries to get a new needle without returning the old
one will be expelled from the program, Joseph said.
   City officials say the program is believed to be the first of its
kind in the United States, though similar programs have operated in
Europe. In Boston, Mayor Raymond Flynn had backed a similar
proposal, but it was rejected by the city council earlier this year;
in Portland, Ore., plans for needle distribution were delayed by
problems obtaining liability insurance.
   New York's program ``is an attempt to find out whether an
exchange can be helpful in slowing (AIDS) transmission among the
addicts and to their sex partners and unborn children that is having
a devastating effect on minority communities,'' said Joseph.
   But two prominent black city officials, Police Commissioner
Benjamin Ward and Special Narcotics Prosecutor Sterling Johnson,
criticized the program, as did the City Council's Black and Hispanic
Caucus.
   ``When the first needle is given out by Stephen Joseph, he ought
to be indicted for murder. It's genocide, pure and simple,'' said
Councilman Hilton Clark of Harlem.
   Joseph termed such criticism ``outrageous,'' adding: ``When you
look at who this crisis is hitting hardest, it's the black community
that's bearing the brunt. The lives that can be saved if this
program works is the lives of black women and babies.''
   Originally, the needles were supposed to be exchanged at other
sites around the city. But when officials at a Manhattan school
complained that the school was next door to one of those sites, the
city announced that the program would be limited to Health
Department headquarters for the moment.
   Of the nearly 17,000 AIDS cases reported in the city since 1981,
about 4,500 are believed to have contracted the disease through
intravenous drug abuse. More than half of the city's 200,000 drug
addicts are believed to be infected with the AIDS virus, according
to Joseph.
   Meanwhile, in a speech to corporate executives in Manhattan, U.S.
Surgeon General C. Everett Koop endorsed the concept of a pilot
needle exchange program, although he said later he was unfamiliar
with the details of the New York program.
   Of needle exchanges in general, he said Monday: ``Let's do it.
... This (AIDS epidemic) is a catastrophe waiting to happen.''

   Tunisia's political parties signed a
``National Pact'' of conduct Monday and President Zine El Abidine
Ben Ali announced that presidential and legislative elections would
be held April 9, 1989.
   Ben Ali, in a speech to Parliament marking the first anniversary
of his gaining power, called for a ``political regime based on
democracy and pluralism.''
   Ben Ali succeeded President Habib Bourguiba on Nov. 7, 1988,
after doctors ruled that Bourguiba was senile.
   Bourguiba's Destourian Socialist Party dominated Tunisia for more
than 30 years. Ben Ali renamed the governing party the
Constitutional Democratic Rally.
   Leaders of the six officially recognized political parties, eight
labor unions and professional organizations and the president of the
Tunisian League of Human Rights signed the document on political
conduct in a ceremony at the presidential palace in suburban
Carthage.
   A member of the Islamic Tendency Movement, which is not legally
recognized, also signed the pact.
   The document sets out political, economic and social principles
to exist under democratic rule.
   Among the provisions are:
   _Respect for the Arabic and Islamic character of Tunisia and
fundamental human rights.
   _Respect for ``the freedom of thought, of the exercise of
religion and of the press and to separate the political struggle
from the religious field and the mosques, which should be strictly
reserved for prayer.''
   _Support the ``political neutrality of the forces of security,
the army, the national guard and the police ... which is one of the
conditions for the survival of democracy.''
   _Acceptance of the family code established under the Bourguiba
government including the abolition of polygamy and the equality of
men and women under the law.
   _Support of the Arab League and the Palestinian demand for an
independent state.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis and Republican George
Bush made half-hour network appeals for votes Monday night, the
final chapter in a long, often nasty television war that played a
key campaign role.
   Dukakis, the underdog, hit on traditional Democratic themes in a
program featuring him on the stump, dancing with his wife, playing
the trumpet and answering questions from voters at town meetings.
   Much of the program featured questions posed by people taped at
locations all around the country, asking questions about Dukakis'
seeming coldness during the campaign, his reluctance to respond to
attacks and his positions on defense.
   ``Maybe I don't wear my heart on my sleeve, but my passion is in
my service to the public,'' said the Massachusetts governor,
appearing in a red pullover sweater in a room filled with books.
   Dukakis spent much of the half hour responding to issues raised
by Bush, among them his crime record and his defense positions. If
elected, he told one questioner, ``you can bet your life ... that
this nation will be defended and defended well.''
   The Bush film included sizable chunks of his nomination
acceptance speech and clips from debates as well as a number of his
campaign commercials, dropped virtually unedited into the middle of
the program.
   President Reagan, Barbara Bush, the Bush children and the Bush
grandchildren all appeared in the program, and Bush's media adviser,
Roger Ailes, played a brief offscreen role as interviewer. But vice
presidential nominee Dan Quayle, whom polls have shown to be a drag
on the ticket, was nowhere to be found.
   Bush said at one point that he respected his opponent. But the
program included reiterations of his criticism of Dukakis for
opposing the death penalty, school prayer and a law requiring
teachers to lead the Pledge of Allegiance, and for supporting a
liberal prisoner furlough program.
   In one of the only new segments, Bush contended: ``My opponent
has no experience in national security affairs. I don't believe we
can take a risk on an issue as important as our national security.''
   In the final days before the election, Dukakis intensified his
television drive in key medium-sized and small states while Bush
added a slashing five-minute attack ad to his TV mix. The lengthy
Bush commercial is a reprise of his attacks on Dukakis' record on
crime, the economy and the environment.
   Dukakis, whose program prominently featured vice presidential
nominee Lloyd Bentsen, opened his network appeal with footage from
an Oct. 26 town meeting in Naperville, Ill.
   In the course of the broadcast he addressed questions about
family, jobs, senior citizens, hunger and farmers. He also attacked
the Republicans' agricultural policy and charged that they would
balance the budget by cutting Social Security.
   Dukakis touted his management of the Massachusetts economy,
saying he had inherited ``a financial and economic basket case''
that is now an economic success story. And he belittled what he
called ``the only new idea George Bush has had since this campaign
began _ a new $40 billion, five-year capital gains tax giveaway for
the very rich.''
   ``Now who is going to pay for that tax break?'' Dukakis demanded.
``Look beside you. Look behind you. Look in the mirror and ask
yourself, is George Bush on your side?''
   It was left to Bentsen to complain about Bush's hardball media
strategy. ``The people of Texas have been outraged by the
distortions the Republicans have made with their commercial TV,'' he
said. And he contended that voters are also ``deeply concerned''
about the choice of Quayle.
   Bush did not appear in his five-minute broadside against Dukakis.
Instead, state residents, officials and others were shown charging
that Dukakis was responsible for budget deficits, tax hikes, job
losses, Boston Harbor pollution and a prison furlough program.
   ``It's a broad overview of everything that Michael Dukakis stands
for, according to his record,'' Bush ad director Sig Rogich said
Monday.
   He said the ad was running in selected markets and denied it was
introduced in response to narrowing poll margins. ``It was planned
long ago,'' Rogich said.
   Dukakis intensified his media drive over the final weekend in
eight states where polls showed the race was tightening, as a hedge
against potential losses in one or two large industrial states. The
expanded buys were in Arkansas, Colorado, Kentucky, Louisiana,
Missouri, Montana, New Mexico and South Dakota.
   All told, Dukakis was running eight ads in spot markets in 30
states as his campaign ended, according to spokeswoman Lorraine
Voles. Most of them stressed his ``on your side'' slogan. Another
attacked Bush's record as head of a drug interdiction task force and
his choice of Quayle and there was also a spot that featured
Bentsen's famous ``You're no Jack Kennedy'' retort to Quayle during
their debate.
   Among the ads running for Bush in spot markets across the country
and on various networks were a musical appeal and a spot saying he
is the only candidate experienced enough to negotiate with Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev.

   A buoyant George Bush ended his presidential quest
Monday night in his adopted home state of Texas after declaring,
``It's in the hands of the gods and the American people.''
   Addressing 6,000 enthusistic supporters in a downtown shopping
mall, the vice president said, ``Most Americans believe our best
days are still ahead.''
   With that line, borrowed from Democratic rival Michael Dukakis,
Bush ended a presidential campaign he formally begun in this city
nearly 13 months ago.
   ``It's great to be back where it all began, right here in
Texas,'' said Bush, who maintains a legal voting residence here in a
hotel suite.
   Bush also addressed the nation in a 30-minute prime time
commercial that combined footage from his convention acceptance
speech of last August with parts of early commercials, clips of
members of his family and a direct election-eve appeal to voters
that was taped last week.
   In the ad, Bush echoed President Reagan 1980 campaign line,
saying, ``If you elect me president you will be better off four
years from now than you are today.''
   In that campaign, Reagan had asked, ``Are you better off today
than you were four years ago.''
   The film may have been as notable for what it did not include as
what it did, any mention of Bush's sometimes controversial running
mate, Sen. Dan Quayle.
   On the way to the gala finale in Houston, the Republican
presidential nominee barnstormed three battleground states in the
Middle West _ Michigan, Ohio and Missouri _ which have a combined 54
electoral votes.
   Bush told rallies in rural Ashland, Ohio, and in the Detroit
suburb of Southfield, Mich., that he felt momentum building in his
favor.
   ``That adrenalin is flowing,'' Bush told a cheering crowd in the
Ashland College gymnasium. ``Our family's together. The country's
coming in behind our candidacy, and I want to win this election.''
   Bush appeared with members of his family and campaign at the
Houston rally, where he couldn't resist delivering several final
vollies at Dukakis.
   ``Don't play recession roulette with the liberal governor of
Massachusetts,'' and said. But the line getting the biggest cheer
was the oft-repeated campaign refrain which Bush said ``can be
summed up in three short words: no new taxes.''
   Earlier, in St. Louis, at his Missouri campaign headquarters, he
said, ``I feel good, but we're not going to let up until we finish
tonight. ... It's in the hands of the gods and the American people.''
   He told volunteers there that he hoped the harsh campaign talk of
the past few months was over. ``Today is for looking over the
horizon and into the future,'' he said.
   Earlier, standing before a huge American flag in a Southfield
shopping mall, the GOP nominee said he was heading for the finish
``not in a power walk but in a sprint.'' It was a mocking reference
to Dukakis' favorite form of exercise, a fast-paced walk with
weights in each hand.
   Bush and Dukakis crossed paths during the last hours of their
campaigns, but Bush spokeswoman Sheila Tate insisted that the vice
president was not stalking his opponent.
   ``Is Dukakis shadowing us?'' she asked.
   Ms. Tate said the Midwest was crucial to Bush's election hopes
and that he was seizing the opportunity for ``a final presence'' to
boost his chances of carrying each state.
   She said the campaign's overnight tracking polls showed Bush's
nationwide leading holding at eight to 10 percentage points and that
no further slippage was detected.
   ``He's in really good spirits'' and unconcerned by Dukakis'
all-night campaign effort, Ms. Tate said.
   ``He slept like a baby,'' Barbara Bush, the candidate's wife,
told reporters on Air Force Two.
   She reacted philosophically to the end of the campaign. ``What
will be will be,'' she said, and expressed surprise at the Dukakis'
non-stop final day of campaigning. ``That's brutal,'' she said.
   Bush told the Michigan rally that ``what it all boils down to is
that my opponent and I have a fundamentally different view of the
future of America.'' He said, ``This is no time for the United
States to turn dramatically left.''
   ``We don't want to return to my opponent's favorite song: For all
you do, this recession is for you, '' Bush said.

<HEAD>Government Unveils Plans for Broadcast Deregulation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government announced Monday it would introduce
a package of legislation to create a fifth TV channel and
de-regulate the country's entire broadcasting network.
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, the government minister responsible
for broadcasting, said the legislation to be put before Parliament
next year would lead to a huge expansion of choice for viewers and
listeners.
   Britain now has two non-commercial channels run by the publicly
funded British Broadcasting Corp. and two independent commercial
channels.
   Hurd said the plans included a fifth channel, to start
broadcasting in 1993, two new satellite stations and three
independent national radio networks.
   Independent radio currently is confined to regional networks, and
plans for three satellite stations already have been approved by the
government.
   Because the franchises for the new channel would go to
competitive tender, the plan has aroused concern that there would be
less stringent quality control than now exists.
   Hurd said the BBC would be expected to continue ``high quality''
programming in both television and its network of national and
regional radio.
   Although TV watching is a top leisure activity among Britain's
population of 56 million, change in the country's viewing
opportunities has come slowly.
   Recent government figures show that 95 percent of the population
watches some televison and the average is 25 hours a week.
   A survey by the Independent Broadcasting Authority, which is
responsible for commercial television, showed only one in three
British adults had ever heard of the advent of direct satellite to
home TV broadcasting, and only one-third were interested in renting
or buying the receiving equipment.

   A passenger train collided with a freight train
injuring at least 50 people near the city of Ciego De Avila in
south-central Cuba, the state-owned Radio Rebelde reported Monday.
   Authorities blamed the accident on the conductor of the passenger
train, saying Rigoberto Ismael Hernandez didn't stop the train at a
railway crossing as required by regulations, according to the
broadcast monitored in Miami.
   No fatalities were reported and no further details were broadcast.

   An Iranian father and son were sentenced Monday to
14 months and 6 months in prison, respectively, for trying to
smuggle high-tech missile parts from the United States to Teheran.
   U.S. District Judge Mark L. Wolf said he imposed ``what might
seem to some a relatively short sentence'' against 64-year-old Ahmad
Modarressi and his son, Majid, 30.
   Wolf said mitigating factors included the elder Modarressi's age
and poor health, the younger Modarressi's naivete and the father's
belief that the U.S. government was interested in improving
relations with Iran.
   Wolf characterized the younger Modarressi, who appeared in court
with his American wife and 4-year-old daughter, as ``extremely
naive, perhaps more accruately described as extremely stupid.''
   Among the son's gaffes, Wolf said, were suggesting a $60 million
illegal deal over the telephone to an unknown Raytheon Co. worker,
not knowing what a TOW missile was and inquiring about Stinger
missiles simply because he had heard them mentioned in a TV news
report about Afghanistan.
   Wolf sentenced Ahmad Modarressi to 14 months in prison, including
10 months he has already served. As an Iranian national, he could be
deported after his release.
   Majid Modarressi was sentenced to 189 days in jail, the amount of
time he has already served. He will also be required to perform 500
hours of community service in Cincinnati, where he has been an
unemployed architect.
   Federal prosecutors had suggested a 2-year sentence for both for
violating the U.S. Arms Export Control Act by attempting to buy
microwave tubes for the Hawk anti-aircraft missile system and sell
them to Iran.
   The father pleaded guilty during their trial in U.S. District
Court while the son was convicted Oct. 26 by a jury after a 19-day
trial.
   The trial stemmed from a 10-month investigation in which a U.S.
Customs Service agent posed as an employee of Raytheon, the
Lexington-based firm that makes the Hawk system.
   An undercover agent recorded conversations in which he pretended
to agree to steal microwave amplification tubes from Raytheon and
sell them for $280,000 to the Modarressis.
   The Iranians were arrested Jan. 15 in a suburban Boston freight
yard where they had come to inspect the so-called twystron and
klystron tubes.
   The Modarressis said they planned to disguise the tubes as
well-drilling equipment and ship them to Iran via a third country
such as Libya, Turkey or Switzerland. The tubes are a critical
component of the radar system that allows the Hawk to blast jet
aircraft out of the sky.
   The United States has prosecuted at least 46 cases of arms
smuggling or attempted arms smuggling to Iran since 1981, when the
country's 8-year war with neighboring Iraq began.
   A truce in the war was announced Aug. 20. But U.S. officials said
Iran has maintained its effort to obtain spare parts for its
military hardware, the bulk of which was bought from the United
States by the American-backed Shah government before the 1979
Islamic revolution.
   U.S. officials said the Modarressi case pointed out the dire need
Iran has for parts. Though the initial attempted deal was for
$280,000, tapes revealed the Iranians discussed buying up to $60
million in U.S. weapons, including Stinger missiles and spare parts
for the F-4 and F-14 jets.

   A defendant in a Mafial trial tossed a
homemade bomb in the courtroom Monday, and the explosion sent
lawyers diving for cover but caused no injuries and only minor
damage, news reports said.
   The Italian news agency ANSA, quoting prosecutor Francesco
Saluzzo, said the bomb was made out of gunpowder hidden in a
cigarette package.
   Saluzzo said defendant Antonio Marano, 44, shouted a warning and
then tossed the explosive in the direction of a cell occupied by a
group of other defendants in the trial.
   The court was convened Monday morning to hear the deposition of
Salvatore Parisi, a Mafia informer who has confessed to 20 murders
and already has been sentenced to 22 years in prison.
   Marano was among 18 defendants who face charges of homicide in
connection with a war between rival gangs for control of the drug
market.
   The same court last Friday convicted 130 people, including two
judges, of belonging to a Mafia group that committed crimes
throughout Italy.
   The court sentenced 26 of them to life in prison for their roles
in the gang, which is blamed for 61 killings, four abductions and
hundreds of robberies.
   Seven relatives of informants in the trial were killed.
   The court on Monday immediately ordered an investigation into how
the defendant obtained the explosives and made the bomb.

   A woman who admitted holding a gun to the
head of a 2-year-old boy and threatening to kill him during a 1969
skyjacking was sentenced Monday to six months in jail and five
years' probation.
   Linda Joyce Grinage, 39, in a tearful plea for leniency,
expressed remorse for her role in the 1969 hijacking of a plane to
Cuba from Kennedy International Airport.
   ``I realize I endangered the lives of innocent people and I
frightened them,'' said Mrs. Grinage, who lived in the Albany area
for about 10 years under the name Haziine Eytina, with her second
husband, Mylo Eytina, and five children.
   She was arrested in July after the FBI received an anonymous tip.
   She already has served all but 33 days of the six-month jail term.
   Mrs. Grinage pleaded guilty Aug. 17 to a charge of interfering
with the crew of the Eastern Airlines jet bound for Miami from New
York on Jan. 2, 1969.
   She admitted helping her first husband, Tyrone Ellington Austin,
force the plane to Havana by taking the boy hostage. The child, his
mother and 146 others on board were freed unharmed when the plane
landed in Havana.
   At her sentencing, Mrs. Grinage said that she understands the
feelings of Beverly Levi of West Islip, the mother of the 2-year-old.
   ``Over the last twenty years, I have suffered greatly,'' Grinage
said. ``I've been forced to abandon my two children by my first
marriage and I've been forced to live a double life with my husband
and five children.
   ``I'm now an honest, hardworking woman.''
   After U.S. District Court Judge Jacob Mishler pronounced the
sentence, she thanked him. ``I think you earned it,'' the judge
said. ``I hope you prove it.''
   She had been held in the Metropolitan Corrections Center in
Manhattan since her arrest.
   When she pleaded guilty, she claimed she had been beaten and
terrorized by her husband, who was killed by New York City police in
a 1971 gunfight following a bank robbery.
   ``I knew what my husband had planned,'' Mrs. Grinage said then.
``I was terrified of my husband. If he told me to walk off the side
of a building I would have done so.''
   Grinage also was indicted on charges of air piracy and
interference with a flight crew with a deadly weapon, which were
were dismissed. She admitted to the least of the charges,
interference without the use of a weapon.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Kill Five in Attacks</HEAD>

   Maoist guerrillas killed two policemen, a
soldier and two children in attacks in Peru's Andean highlands,
officials said Monday.
   Police said about 30 guerrillas of the Shining Path movement
attacked a on a police post in San Agustin de Cajas on Sunday
evening. The village is 10 miles north of Huancayo, an important
trading center in the central Andes 135 miles east of Lima.
   A wedding was under way in the second floor of the building,
which also serves as municipal headquarters, when the rebels
attacked with explosives and automatic rifle fire.
   Two girls, ages 12 and 14, who were among the guests were killed
during the attack and a woman was severely wounded, police said.
   Police defenders were unharmed during the attack and after 15
minutes of heavy shooting, the rebels escaped from town in a stolen
truck, police said.
   Another group of insurgents shot and killed an off-duty soldier
caught in a rebel roadblock Sunday night near Huancayo, police said.
   Elsewhere in the highlands, another Shining Path column of 25
rebels attacked two rural police posts before dawn Sunday 55 miles
northeast of Puno, a city on Lake Titicaca 610 miles southeast of
Lima.
   A Puno official, Victor Urbiola Garrido, told The Associated
Press by telephone that the rebels killed two policemen, wounded two
more and burned one of the posts before withdrawing.
   In Peru's jungle region, rebels of the pro-Cuba Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement bombed half a dozen governnment and private
buildings Sunday night in Pucallpa, 350 miles northeast of Lima,
police said.
   The rebels hurled bombs at the offices of a state development
corporation, the municipal headquarters, the water company, a
school, a state agricultural agency and a large grocery store,
causing damage to the buildings but no injuries, according to police.
   The Shining Path launched an insurgency against Peru's elected
government eight years ago, and the death toll in the violence since
then has surpassed 12,000.
   The Tupac Amaru group, a much smaller band, became active in
1984, concentrating on late-night bombings in Lima. A year ago it
opened a front in Peru's northern jungle with about 100 armed
rebels, but the army moved into the area and quickly broke up the
column.
   Police said the attack in Pucallpa may indicate the group is
trying to re-establish a base in the jungle.

   A weakened Typhoon Skip roared into
the South China Sea Tuesday after killing at least five people and
forcing thousands from their homes but sparing the capital its full
fury.
   The government weather service said Skip, the second typhoon to
strike the Philippines in as many weeks, swept across Mindoro island
early Tuesday and at mid-morning was reported about 150 miles
southwest of Manila in the South China Sea.
   Maximum winds weakened to about 93 mph as the storm swept across
the central Visayas island chain, the weather service said.
   Skip trajectory kept it about 100 miles south of Manila, saving
the capital from the high winds and flooding brought by Typhoon Ruby
two weeks ago.
   Reports of damage and casualties from Typhoon Skip were sketchy
because of poor communications to the affected area. The Red Cross
said at least five people were killed Monday in Camarines Sur
province.
   They included three confirmed dead in a landslide in Pasacao
about 210 miles southeast of Manila in Camarines Sur. The Red Cross
said 23 people were reported buried in the mudslide but only three
bodies had been recovered.
   Late Monday, a radio station in the Camarines Sur city of Naga
put the death toll in Pasacao at 10, including six children. The Red
Cross said at least two other children died when a tornado triggered
by Skip roared through another town in Camarines Sur.
   Most of the damage was reported in the Visayas and in
southeastern Luzon in the country's ``typhoon belt.''
   Skip came ashore early Monday on Samar island, 410 miles
southeast of Manila, with winds up to 108 mph and moved across the
islands of Masbate, Romblon and Tablas.
   The Social Services Department reported nearly 400,000 people
``affected'' by the typhoon, meaning their homes or property were
damaged or destroyed. It said most were on Leyte Island, which was
without electricity because Skip's winds blew down power lines.
   Departmental spokeswoman Teresita Padua estimated damage on Leyte
alone at about $400,000.
   Government officials said about 24,000 people were affected on
Cebu island, mostly from flooding.
   The coast guard said waves created by the typhoon sank a
freighter in a Bohol Island port, but reported no casualties among
the crew.
   Storm warnings were posted in Manila and the government ordered
schools closed Tuesday. Most domestic flights from the Manila
airport were canceled Tuesday but Philippine Airlines said service
would be restored by nightfall.
   The U.S. military's Far East Network television service said the
six American military installations, including Clark Air Base and
the Subic Bay naval base, could expect winds up to 60 mph early
Tuesday.
   Some Military Airlift Command flights to Japan and the United
States left early to avoid the storm, it said.
   Heavy rains caused landslides on the Mayon volcano, 200 miles
southeast of Manila on Luzon's Bicol Peninsula, the Philippines News
Agency said.
   Hundreds of families were isolated by the slides and about 2,600
were evacuated from the slopes of Mayon, the country's best-known
volcano, the agency reported.
   A coast guard report said the 326-ton freighter Sea Runner sank
in port on Bohol on Monday after a battering by strong winds and
heavy waves. All 17 crewmen escaped but the cargo, 11,250 bags of
cement, was reported lost.
   The Civil Defense Office said 14 of the 16 towns in Capiz
province, 250 miles southeast of Manila on Panay Island, were
flooded Monday and hundreds of families were being evacuated to
schools and churches.
   More than 700 people were evacuated from low-lying areas of Aklan
province, also on Panay, the office said.
   Typhoon Ruby struck the Philippines on Oct. 24, and tropical
storm Tess swept through the Visayas Islands on Saturday.
   Officials said Ruby killed at least 181 people on land. At least
64 others were killed and more than 200 are missing from the
passenger ship Dona Marilyn, which sank 300 miles southeast of
Manila during the typhoon.
   The Social Welfare Department reported at least eight people
killed Saturday near Cebu, 350 miles south of Manila, during
flooding caused by Tess. The Red Cross said three were killed by
floods on Palawan Island.
   Skip is the 20th typhoon or tropical storm to hit the archipelago
in 1988.

   Former Miss America Bess Myerson may have offered
a job to a witness who was to testify against her, a prosecutor said
Monday in a conference with the judge hearing the divorce-fixing
case.
   Walter Canter, a former journalist who worked as a speechwriter
for Miss Myerson over a 15-year period, testified he heard from her
last month for the first time since she fired him in 1983.
   Miss Myerson, the former commissioner of the Department of
Cultural Affairs; her companion, Carl ``Andy'' Capasso, 43; and
former state Supreme Court Justice Hortense Gabel, 75, are on trial
on charges stemming from Capasso's divorce case.
   Miss Myerson, 64, is accused of giving a $19,000-a-year city job
to Mrs. Gabel's daughter, Sukhreet Gabel, to influence the judge's
decision in the divorce case.
   The judge's daughter was hired in August 1983 and Mrs. Gabel
slashed Capasso's temporary alimony and child support payments to
his estranged wife less than a month later.
   Moments after Canter's testimony Monday, the defense objected,
and U.S. District Judge John Keenan excused the jury and held a
private conference with prosecutors and defense attorneys.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Stuart Abrams said Miss Myerson told
Canter ``that she was thinking of starting a foundation and that she
thought he would be a good person to head the foundation,''
according to a transcript released at the end of the day's hearing.
   ``Is there anything more?'' the judge asked. ``Is it that the
inference is to be drawn that she was trying to buy him off by
offering him something at a foundation?''
   ``I think that is a fair inference,'' Abrams said, adding that
Canter ``sort of made light of it ... he essentially sloughed it
off.''
   Miss Myerson's lawyer, Frederick Hafetz, said: ``I think it's an
ambiguous conversation.''
   Keenan agreed that the situation was ambiguous and that the
testimony might be prejudicial to the other defendants. He ruled it
could not be allowed as testimony.
   The lawyers and defendants are operating under a gag order and
could not be asked for comment.
   However, Canter, in a telephone interview Monday evening,
discounted what prosecutors said.
   ``I explained it to those guys (federal prosecutors) there. It's
a joke, a longstanding joke between us,'' Canter said.
   ``The only interpretation to it, I guess, was she was trying to
have her sense of humor come out. That is something, when you are
between a rock and a hard place, to have your sense of humor,''
Canter said.
   ``Believe me, it's a non-story.''
   Canter also testified that when he went to work for Miss Myerson
at Cultural Affairs, he did not have to go through a city interview
process, his resume was not submitted for review and he did not have
the stated qualifications for the job title he operated under.
   ``I wasn't aware of titles,'' Canter testified.
   ``Miss Myerson was familiar with my background and the work I had
done,'' he added. ``I knew what I had been brought in to do and I
did it.''

<HEAD>Reduced Charge Agreement Reached In Jazz Musician's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nightclub manager who confessed to
the beating death of jazz musician Jaco Pastorius pleaded guilty
Monday to a reduced manslaughter charge that can bring a maximum of
21 months in prison.
   Prosecutors said they reached the agreement with Luc Havan, 26,
after conflicting evidence weakened the first-degree murder case,
which could have brought life imprisonment.
   Havan, a Vietnamese immigrant, is scheduled for sentencing in
Broward Circuit Court on Dec. 5 and could also receive five years
probation.
   Havan contended he pushed Pastorius, 35, as he tried to enter the
club in an intoxicated state. But a medical examiner's report
indicated Pastorius suffered massive head injuries before falling
into a coma.
   Pastorius died nine days after the Sept. 11, 1987, incident at
the Fort Lauderdale club.
   Pastorius, born in Fort Lauderdale, was one of the nation's
pre-eminent bass players in the late 1970s, when he toured with
Blood, Sweat and Tears, Joni Mitchell and Weather Report. He was
nominated for three Grammy Awards.
   Pastorius over the past five years gradually fell into alcohol
and drug abuse and was homeless at the time of his death.
   Hours before the fatal incident, Pastorius had jumped on stage
and disrupted a Carlos Santana concert in suburban Sunrise.
   Ingrid Pastorius of Deerfield Beach, the victim's former wife,
said she was satisfied with the plea.
   ``I feel this man pleaded guilty from the heart,'' she said. ``As
the mother of Jaco's two sons, I feel good that I can tell them
there's a man who admitted hitting and killing their father. So I
can live with this deal.''

   As President Reagan and his aides returned
Monday from a 14-hour, election-eve campaign blitz trip to
California, White House officials treated the president to a glass
of champagne, a campaign cake and a record album including the tune,
``Michael Row the Boat Ashore.''
   Dropping all pretense of avoiding any predictions about the
possible election of Vice President George Bush, White House chief
of staff Kenneth Duberstein offered Reagan a toast as Air Force One
sped back to Washington.
   ``It's been a privilege to work for you the past eight years and
in this campaign. We feel you've done what no other president has
done in 150 years _ elect your vice president,'' White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater quoted Duberstein as saying.
   Because it was the last leg of the final campaign trip of his
presidency, the president's aides also presented him with a large,
white cake, decorated in red and blue with the words:
   ``Win One for the Gipper. Victory 88, We are the change,'' all
well-used GOP campaign slogans.
   The staff then gave Reagan an album of Pete Seeger songs, which
included the selection, ``Michael Row the Boat Ashore,'' one of the
quips Reagan has regularly included in his stump speech in order to
poke fun at Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis' defense policies.
   Fitzwater reported that Reagan not only joined in eating a bit of
the cake, but had a glass of champagne to celebrate his trip.
   Reagan, Duberstein later said, ``is feeling really upbeat...He
feels he gave it his best shot for George Bush in California.''

   With two Texans on the national ticket, Lloyd Bentsen and George
Bush, voter turnout in the Lone Star State is expected to be high.
But elsewhere, political parties and other groups are scrambling to
get a reluctant electorate out on Election Day.
   ``I don't see nearly as much enthusiasm as you typically see in a
presidential year,'' said Chris Verenes, executive director of the
South Carolina Democratic Party, in a comment echoed across the
country.
   With only half of the country's eligible voters expected to turn
out Tuesday, down from the 1984 figure of 53 percent, Republicans
and Democrats alike know that getting people to vote will be their
No. 1 challenge.

   Partisans of 29 statewide propositions
Californians face Tuesday spent a record $130 million _ more than $9
a voter _ on a media war involving issues like car insurance rates,
AIDS and raising cigarette taxes.
   More than half the spending has centered on five conflicting
propositions aimed at revamping the auto insurance rate-setting
process and lowering premiums.
   Insurance companies alone, fearing a budding ``car premium
revolt,'' poured more than $60 million into the battle, and trial
lawyers' groups spent $15 million, making it the most expensive
single campaign in the country outside a presidential race.

   America's wealthiest families are keeping ahead
of inflation, the poorest are losing ground, and many of the rest
are holding even only because more family members are working, a new
economic study shows.
   The study conducted for the Economic Policy Institute shows a
widening gap between rich and poor since President Reagan took
office, with the top-earning 20 percent making nine times as much
money in 1986 as the poorest 20 percent, compared with seven times
as much in 1979.
   Institute President Jeff Faux said the report shows average
American families have been under greater economic pressure during
the past decade than at any time since World War II.

   A new Iran-Contra grand jury is conducting what
appears to be an investigation of possible perjury by witnesses
questioned by Congress or another grand jury about the
arms-for-hostages affair.
   The new grand jury has viewed videotaped recordings of testimony
given to the House and Senate committees that investigated the
Reagan administration's arms deals with Iran and the diversion of
money to the Nicaraguan rebels, said sources speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh took measures to isolate
his staff and the original Iran-Contra grand jury from news coverage
of the congressional hearings. He wanted to avoid defense
accusations that he relied on evidence given to Congress under
limited grants of immunity to bring charges against former White
House aide Oliver L. North and others indicted earlier this year by
the first Iran-Contra grand jury.

   Lawmakers angered by President Reagan's veto of
a bill to limit advertising in children's TV programs say Congress
will be back next year with another, possibly tougher measure.
   Reagan killed the bill late Saturday night with a pocket veto,
even though the measure had overwhelming support in Congress.
Critics likened his action to ``ideological child abuse'' and called
his administration ``morally bankrupt.''
   Reagan said the bill to impose ad limits and make children's
informational programming a condition of station license renewals
would violate constitutional guarantees of free speech and might
discourage commercial networks from financing quality children's
programming.

   Her month-old business ``Enough is Enough,'' billed as ``creative
revenge for today's world,'' has already mailed a three-foot dead
bluefish to a philandering husband in California and delivered a
burned and messy suit to a lawyer who implied his girlfriend was
``unsuitable'' for him.
   More common requests among those wronged, however, are the 13
dead roses, sent in a beribboned black box ($25), or 13 black

   Nobel laureate Andrei Sakharov, on his first trip
to the West, warned Monday that Mikhail Gorbachev's political
restructuring of the Soviet Union faces a domestic backlash that
could endanger world peace.
   The 67-year-old physicist and father of the Soviet dissident
movement said political prisoners continue to languish in labor
camps while new laws have increased police powers and restricted
public demonstrations.
   ``It seems to me that this is extremely dangerous and could
destroy the process of perestroika (political and economic
restructuring) and turn it around,'' Sakharov said.
   If Gorbachev's reforms do not succeed, he warned, ``Internal
failure could be accompanied by external expansion. For the
preservation of the system, expansion would be a necessity. ... It
would be a catastrophe from which would arise a great threat to all
humanity.''

   New York City on Monday began a pilot program to
stem the spread of AIDS by providing drug addicts new hypodermic
needles in exchange for their used ones.
   Although the program aimed at reducing needle sharing among
addicts is intended to serve as many as 200 intravenous drug
abusers, by early afternoon no applicant had appeared at Health
Department headquarters in lower Manhattan.
   ``Today, we're going to have only a handful,'' said the health
commissioner, Dr. Stephen Joseph. ``We're going to build slowly up''
over a period of weeks or months, he predicted.
   Under the $240,000 program, which has drawn heated opposition
from conservatives and some minority group organizations, addicts
also will receive counseling on AIDS and drugs. Another 200 addicts
will receive only counseling; over time, their rate of infection
will be compared with the infection rate of those receiving needles.

   The government amnesty program for illegal immigrants entered its
second phase Monday, but turnout was light on the first day those
who took advantage of the program could begin applying for permanent
residency.
   U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service officials expect
about 1.5 million of the 1.8 million non-agricultural amnesty
applicants to apply for permanent residency. Most are from Latin
America.
   Permanent resident status brings a person a so-called green card
_ they've actually been white since 1976 _ which allows them to
leave and enter the country at will and to eventually apply for
citizenship.
   Amnesty recipients who apply for permanent residency must either
take a 60-hour English and civics class from an INS-certified school
or pass an oral and written test similar to the citizenship test
given to permanent residents who enter this country legally.

   Syria is facing new political challenges
that are testing President Hafez Assad's power in the region.
   Long-time rival Iraq is challenging Assad in Lebanon, his own
backyard, and more broadly in the Arab world. Moderate Arab leaders
like President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt are lining up to curb Assad's
influence in Lebanon.
   At the same time, the Palestinian uprising in Israeli-held
territories has bolstered another rival, Yasser Arafat of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, and likely weakened Syria's role
in the Middle East peace process.
   Assad, however, has proven himself a strong and agile leader
since he came to power in a 1970 coup. He has suffered setbacks
before, and managed to come out ahead.
   The ideological feud between Syria and Iraq, one of the most
bitter inter-Arab vendettas, has been rekindled by the Aug. 20
cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war. Assad had been Persian Iran's main
Arab ally against a fellow Arab.
   Other Arabs bitterly criticized Assad for siding with Iran, even
though he argued that the alliance gave Syria leverage that helped
keep the conflict from spreading, a claim most Arabs question.
   Meanwhile, Iran's military collapse, which forced it to accept
the United Nations-sponsored cease-fire, has enhanced the military
and political prestige of the Iraqi leader, President Saddam
Hussein, who sees himself as having saved the Arab world from
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's Islamic revolution.
   Secular Syria and Islamic-fundamentalist Iran have little in
common, except a hatred of Saddam. Syria and Iraq are ruled by rival
wings of the Baath Arab Socialist Party.
   Jordan and Saudi Arabia got Assad and Saddam together last year,
but the reconciliation effort was short-lived.
   Iraq's state-controlled media daily savages Assad as a ``traitor
to the Arab nation'' and ``the slave of the imposters in Tehran.''
Syria's equally controlled press hurls the insults right back.
   In Lebanon, its unruly western neighbor, Syria's interests now
seem to be particularly at risk.
   Syria, which considers itself the main power broker there, has
failed to control the Lebanese Christians and get a pro-Syrian
president elected to succeed Amin Gemayel, whose 6-year term expired
Sept. 23.
   Gemayel, a Maronite Catholic, stepped down without a successor
elected by Parliament because of a boycott by the Christians, who
opposed pro-Syrian candidates, the only serious contenders. The
Lebanese government now has split in two, and Iraq has been arming
the Christians' main militia, the Lebanese Forces.
   The crisis has deepened the partition of Lebanon, split into
Christian and Moslem cantons during the 13-year-old civil war, and
made the prospects of a Syrian-sponsored settlement, a cornerstone
of Assad's foreign policy, even more distant.
   It has also undercut the Syrian claim to be the sole Arab arbiter
in Lebanon, which other countries have never really disputed until
now.
   Arafat, Saddam Hussein, Jordan's King Hussein and Mubarak,
another foe of Assad's because of Cairo's 1979 peace treaty with
Israel, recently formed a new alliance and called for an emergency
Arab summit on Lebanon.
   Mubarak, noting that a Pan-Arab effort was needed to save
Lebanon, stressed that ``there is no time for indulgence in
courtesies toward Syria or other countries.''
   Elsewhere in the region, the 11-month-old Palestinian uprising in
the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip has eclipsed Assad's
efforts to wrench control of the Palestinian cause from Arafat.
   The uprising has dramatically shifted the focus of the
Palestinian cause from the refugee camps in Lebanon, where Syria's
proxies fought for years to crush Arafat's forces, to the occupied
territories where Assad is powerless to intervene.
   Arafat's men were forced out of camps in Beirut by Syrian-backed
Palestinian dissidents, heavily reinforced by Syrian soldiers
disguised as guerrillas.
   But Arafat still has strongholds in south Lebanon and, allied
with Iraq, his strength has been bolstered by the uprising.
   This has robbed Assad of any chance of being able to deliver the
Palestinian card in a Middle East peace settlement, dimming the
prospects of regaining the Golan Heights that Israel captured from
Syria in 1967.
   Arafat's PLO is expected shortly to win approval from the
Palestine National Council, or parliament in exile, to declare a
Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza with a provisional
government.

<HEAD>Young Portuguese Farmers Turning Away from Traditional Crops</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORRES NOVAS, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Young Portuguese farmers are
looking for more stable incomes by switching from traditional grains
such as wheat and corn to more exotic crops like pistachio nuts,
almonds, papayas and truffles.
   Among the hundreds of visitors in October to the Third National
Dry Fruits Fair in this rural town 73 miles northeast of Lisbon,
those most interested in new crops seemed to be young farmers.
   One such couple _ 38-year-old former airline steward Jose Eduardo
Carvalho and his American wife, Paula, 25 _ said they are switching
from wheat to pistachios, almonds, walnuts, papaya and truffles on
the 207-acre farm he inherited from his parents in the Alentejo
region north of the Tagus River.
   The couple said the farm lost more than $26,000 last year on
wheat.
   ``We've both traveled widely and wherever we went pistachios were
so expensive, Jose decided it was time to try grow them himself,''
said Paula, a New Jersey native.
   Carvalho said he hopes to tap the European Economic Community
market, which Portugal's Institute for Foreign Trade said imported
61,480 tons of almonds and 38,557 tons of pistachios last year.
   The institute's data also shows that Portugal's exports of
almonds to the United States have been steadily increasing, reaching
14,000 tons in 1986 and 18,100 tons in 1987.
   But converting his father's crops to more profitable nuts and
fruit is not going to be cheap.
   Carvalho said he has already spent $35,000 to import irrigation
equipment from neighboring Spain.
   But the Carvalhos, as young farmers in Western Europe's poorest
nation, are eligible for EEC aid to help them pay for new projects.
   Other farmers are not so fortunate.
   About two-thirds of Portugal's estimated 970,000 farmers, who
make up about one-fifth of the country's working population but
contribute only about 9 percent to the country's gross domestic
product, are over 55 years old and thus do not qualify for such
assistance projects.
   Many of the tiny working farms in isolated rural areas also have
the added burden of illiteracy and are less motivated to innovate.
   Their productivity lags way behind the West European average, and
Portugal has to import more than half of what it's population of 10
million eats.
   ``Portugal has to select the most appropriate products it can
grow for current market demands,'' said Manuel Rosa, a service
director at the Ministry of Agriculture.
   This means the production of grains (wheat, corn, rye, barley and
oats) has to be cut back and more oranges, lemons and grapefruit
planted. Although citrus crops compete directly with those of other
Mediterranean countries, they still find a market in the colder
northern European countries.
   Other new hopefuls are strawberries and melons. Small-scale
production of avocados by farmers in the southern Algarve region
increased from 353 tons in 1980 to more than 870 tons in 1986,
according to the foreign trade institute.
   ``Portugal's climate is such that it can grow practically
anything exotic,'' said Carvalho, whose decision to cultivate
truffles was prompted by a look at market prices abroad.
   London's famous specialist grocers, Fortnum & Mason, sells 50
grams (1.6 ounces) of imported white Italian truffles for the
equivalent of $83 _ or about $725 a pound.
   French truffles at Fortnum's run more than $900 a pound.

<HEAD>Church Works Behind Scenes for Change in South Africa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While it condemns activism by
clergymen, the Dutch Reformed Church, the most influential in South
Africa, works behind the scenes in trying to persuade the government
to change its apartheid policies.
   The quiet diplomacy usually is undertaken on a personal level:
President P.W. Botha and 90 percent of his all-white Cabinet, plus
most of the white-dominated Parliament, are members of the Dutch
Reformed Church.
   Two years ago, the church, known by its Afrikaans initials as the
NGK, adopted a document called ``Church and Society.'' It declared
apartheid a mistake, termed racism a sin and said the church could
no longer dictate specific political policies.
   Fifty ministers and 30,000 people left the 953,000-member church
to form a new right-wing church. Within the main church, which
represents about 38 percent of the 5 million-white population, a
conservative league was formed to try to repeal ``Church and
Society.''
   The document said the church had been wrong to spend decades
giving biblical justification to apartheid and advocating certain
discriminatory laws, such as a ban on mixed marriage.
   Its new view, the church said, was that the Bible cannot be used
to support any political model, either apartheid or integration.
   Moderator Johan Heyns, elected to head the church during the 1986
synod that adopted ``Church and Society,'' said: ``That did not
imply we have nothing to say to government. The Bible explicitly
tells us there are certain major, universal, applicable, ethical
norms which are of paramount importance for political policy.''
   ``Church and Society'' urges the National Party government to
uphold Scriptural norms, calls the withholding of political rights
an affront to human dignity and asks authorities ``to give ongoing
and sympathetic attention'' to regulations people find offensive.
   Some critics argue the church still gets involved in politics but
that its involvement is tolerated because it is regarded as ``the
National Party at prayer.'' As an example, critics cite the church
leaders' recent urging of congregations to sign petitions opposing
international sanctions against South Africa.
   ``Some individuals in English-speaking churches see in the NGK a
government-supporting church,'' said Heyns. ``That worries me. We do
not support the government, but we have so many members in
government we are responsible to them spiritually.''
   The church is in the position of seeking to represent the
interests of its flock, mainly white Afrikaners, while it is
officially open to all races. It calls for speedier change of
policies it once said were biblically justified and tries not to be
seen as engaging in politics in a country where, Heyns says,
``everything is seen from a political view.''
   In July, the church magazine, Die Kerkbode, questioned the
morality of indefinitely stationing South African troops in Angola,
where Cuban troops support a Marxist government. Two months later,
the South African troops withdrew.
   A few weeks after church leaders said they had spoken to Law and
Order Minister Adriaan Vlok about detentions without trial,
particularly of children, Vlok announced that all detainees under 16
had been released. The large majority of those detained are blacks.
   The church said that since the government has made it legal for
people of different races to marry, it now is wrong not to allow
them to live together where they choose. In October, Parliament's
white chamber passed a bill that would allow the country's first
legal, multiracial residential areas.
   Recently, Heyns has spoken to President Botha about Nelson
Mandela, the imprisoned African National Congress leader, and about
the fate of the Sharpeville Six, a group of blacks sentenced to hang
for participation in the mob killing of a black town councillor.
   Heyns would not disclose details of the discussions.
   ``We are active in these sort of deliberations,'' but cannot
claim credit for the government's decisions, he said. ``The church
and state are completely independent.''
   He and other Dutch Reformed Church leaders disagree strongly with
what they call the ``political activism'' of Desmond Tutu, the black
Anglican archbishop who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984, and the
Rev. Allan Boesak, head of the mixed-race Dutch Reformed Church in
South Africa and president of the World Alliance of Reformed
Churches.
   The alliance disassociated itself with the NGK over apartheid,
and Boesak opposes reconciliation until the white church uses its
influence more emphatically to end apartheid and bring about a
one-person, one-vote political system.
   The NGK says its members should obey the authorities and supports
the government in maintaining law and order. Boesak maintains that
the government is illegitimate, on both theological and political
grounds, and favors a church-led campaign of civil disobedience.
   Heyns said: ``We personally think that the moment they (activist
clergymen) are going to prescribe to government what structure
should be created, they deviate from a pure, church and biblical
view. They become politicians.
   ``That is exactly what we did in the past _ present to the
government a political model.''

   An American tropical insect expert
faces a possible prison term in Brazil for backing native Indians
trying to stop the building of hydroelectric dams that could flood
their tribal lands in the Amazon.
   Darrell Posey, 41, a native of Henderson, Ky., who holds a Ph.D.
from the University of Georgia, has been charged by Brazil's federal
police under a law that prohibits foreigners from ``getting involved
in internal Brazilian affairs'' and ``denigrating the country's
image.'' The maximum penalty is three years in prison, followed by
expulsion.
   Authorities also have forbidden the stocky, bearded, soft-spoken
naturalist from entering certain areas inhabited by native tribes
with which he has worked since 1977. And, under the threat of
dismissal from his Brazilian government job as a professor-level
researcher for the National Research Council, Posey is barred from
leaving Brazil.
   ``The Amazon jungle is being destroyed at an a alarming rate,''
Posey recently told a group of foreign correspondents in Rio de
Janeiro. ``Meanwhile, native Indians have lived in the Amazon for
20,000 years in perfect coexistence with the environment. I'm trying
to call serious attention to the native philosophy for preserving
ecology.
   ``How can that be considered subversive?''
   Brazil traditionally has eyed the vast hydroelectric potential of
the Amazon as a way to expand its already sophisticated industrial
base, situated mostly in the southern part of the country.
   Posey irked Brazilian authorities when earlier this year he took
two chiefs of the Kayapo tribe to a seminar at the University of
Florida where they spoke against reported government hydroelectric
projects in the Amazon and then to Washington where they repeated
their views to the World Bank, which frequently helps finance such
projects.
   ``It was the first time outsiders got to hear the Indians' side
of the Amazon development story,'' Posey said. Chiefs Kube-i and
Paulinho Paiakan, wearing native headdresses and collars and jungle
body paint, addressed their U.S. hosts in Portuguese, Brazil's
official language, and Posey translated.
   In an inexplicable move, the government also indicted the
Indians, who were born in Brazil and never had been out of the
country before, for violating the Foreigners Law.
   ``The charges against the Indians have no legal basis. We'll get
the accusations thrown out,'' said Jose Carlos Castro, a lawyer in
the Amazon-delta city of Belem, where Posey is based. ``The real
purpose is to intimidate Professor Posey and make him shut up.''
   ``This is purely political,'' added Castro, who along with Kube-i
and Paiakan, also met with foreign reporters.
   ``We tried to get information about dams from our own
government,'' said Paiakan. ``But they wouldn't tell us anything.
They treated us like children. So we went to the World Bank, and it
turned out they didn't know much about these projects. Now they do.''
   Federal power officials deny claims by radical environmentalists
that they have a ``secret plan'' to build 26 hydroelectric dams
along Amazon River tributaries where Indians from 11 tribes,
including the 8,500-member Kaiapos, live, fish and hunt in
relatively untouched primitive conditions.
   Of the estimated 5 million Indians here when Portuguese explorers
discovered Brazil in 1500, only around 250,000 remain, in an
over-all population of 144 million. Anthropologists have expressed
fears about the Indians' continued survival, as hundreds of
thousands of non-Indian homesteaders, ranchers and prospectors
stream into the Amazon annually, chopping and burning away the
rainforest and ignoring demarcations of native tribal areas.
   ``There have been a lot of gossip and rumors about hydroelectric
plans in the Amazon,'' Diomedes Ferreira Jr., the spokesman for a
government Amazonian power company called Eletronorte (cq
Eletronorte), said in Brasilia, the capital. ``We have looked into
only six potential dam sites, and we're talking about projects that
wouldn't be carried out until well into the 21st century.''
   ``The government will do everything possible to protect the
environment and the Indians,'' Ferreira said.
   Meanwhile _ and without saying whether the Indians' sudden high
profile had anything to do with it _ the government says it has
shelved plans for a proposed dam known as Babaquara on the Xingu
River, a major Amazon tributary that passes through the Kayapo
lands. Its reservoir would have covered 2,300 square miles, twice
the size of Rhode Island. Brazil had intended to ask the World Bank
to finance it.
   Now, says Ferreira, the only Xingu dam under possible
consideration is one called Kararao, with a reservoir one-fifth the
size of that of Babaquara.
   The World Bank in Washington said construction of the 11
million-kilowatt Kararao installation _ nearly twice as large as
Washington's Grand Coulee Dam, the United States' biggest _ could
not begin until 1991 or 1992.
   Ferreira said, ``So far we're talking only about hydroelectric
potential feasibility studies. We're not saying Kararao will be
built. But even if it is, there wouldn't be another dam in that
region before 2010.''
   Nonetheless, a Kayapo Legal Fund, partially coordinated by Posey,
has been set up at the University of California at Berkeley, to keep
an eye on the Amazon dam situation.
   The Kayapos plan to call a multitribal meeting of up to 5,000
Indians in late January to discuss the overall problem of Amazon
development projects.
   ``The Indians are serious,'' said Posey. ``The problem is that
hardly anyone takes them seriously _ and they have so much to teach
us.''

<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sometimes network news simply informs.
Sometimes it actually enlightens. Sometimes, as in the case of the
1988 presidential election, it does neither.
   When whales bobbing amid Alaska ice floes become as big a
television story as the contest for the next leader of the United
States, something is wrong.
   From the Iowa caucus media spree to the manufactured ``What does
Jesse want?'' stories of the Democratic convention to November's
addiction to opinion polls, television's flashy political coverage
has had the weight of melba toast.
   The collapse of thoughtful reporting comes at a crucial time _
more than half of all Americans now say they depend on television
news as their single source of information. It's no shock, then,
that this year's presidential turnout may be the lowest since Calvin
Coolidge's election in the 1920s. Does anyone want to elect a
soundbite?
   The candidates have been reduced on television to mumblers of
mostly meaningless charges and counter-charges. We may want policy
statements, but we get photo opportunities. Where do the nominees
really stand on Middle East policy? The deficit? Welfare reform?
With occasional exceptions, the networks don't seem to know or care.
   Television, of course, has no legal obligation to present
thorough work. Dan Rather, if he wanted, could read aloud from the
National Enquirer for 22 minutes every weeknight. It's understood,
though, that in exchange for free broadcast licenses, television
will aim every so often for public service.
   Not this time around.
   Television tends to do best when it watches and doesn't create _
that's why a space shuttle launch is usually more riveting than the
latest ``ALF'' episode. At its most useful, television takes our
eyes and ears where they otherwise could not go.
   But in looking at this year's campaign, television's cameras have
blinked rather than stared, thereby helping define the simplistic
terms under which the campaign was to be conducted.
   The resulting flood of video mishmash _ long on symbols and
personalities and short on substance _ has to a degree even
influenced coverage by print journalists. ``Perhaps because there
was not much else to talk about, analysis of this campaign is
already beginning to hone in on television's role,'' Michael Oreskes
of The New York Times wrote recently.
   Not much else to talk about? George Bush and Michael Dukakis sit
at opposite ends of the political spectrum. Surely, there's more
than one story in that. Television, though, doesn't seem to notice.
Its horse-race fascination, to be sure, is nothing new. But in 1988,
it has taken on new dimensions.
   A week and a half before the election, NBC's Tom Brokaw was still
asking Dukakis why he didn't perform better in the second
presidential debate.
   ABC's Sunday newscast _ two days before the election _ led with
an assessment that 439 electoral votes are firmly in or leaning
toward Bush's column, while Dukakis can count 30. Is this a public
service?
   ABC News President Roone Arledge blames the political parties for
fixing the process to such an extent that it's become a bore to the
public and therefore to the news media.
   ``It's very hard to to cover substance when there's no substance
there,'' he told reporters recently. ``And I think more and more
things are packaged for television. And it is not us who are doing
the packaging, and it's not us who wanted to be packaged that way.''
   But why are the campaigns ``packaging'' their message? Because
they know it's the packaged soundbite that will get on the air.
   It's much easier _ and probably more fun _ to produce an
elaborate graphic on the latest poll than analyze arcane issues.
That decision, however, has an impact beyond the basic information
presented. Not only does it discourage intellectual engagement in
the political process, but it also appears to have favored Bush over
Dukakis, since Dukakis' message is arguably more difficult to grasp.
   According to the non-partisan Center for Media and Public
Affairs, television's campaign coverage down the homestretch was
more partial to the Republican ticket. The center's study of 474
ABC, NBC and CBS election stories found that Bush surpassed Dukakis
in ``good press'' by a 56 percent to 22 percent margin. Furthermore,
nearly one story in four featured poll results, usually favorable
toward Bush, the organization reported.
   ``Despite all the attention to his negative ads, Bush's
domination of the network newscasts was the real catalyst to his
comeback,'' said the organization's Robert Lichter.
   David Burke, president of CBS News, said not long ago that ``the
unwanting-to-know'' public is responsible for ``reducing the state
of political art in the country.'' That's an easy out. Chances are
if television had really delved into the issues, viewers would stay
tuned. The game-show fans already have ``Wheel of Fortune.''

   An investor group led by the buyout firm
Forstmann Little & Co. and that includes the consumer products giant
Procter & Gamble Co. emerged as a possible ``white knight'' in the
fight for RJR Nabisco Inc.
   Forstmann Little said late Friday the group was considering a bid
for the food and tobacco products company that would surpass a $20.7
billion offer made by Nabisco management and a competing $20.3
billion bid by the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts Inc.
   In a statement, Forstmann Little said a special committee of the
RJR Nabisco board set up to review the offers ``had welcomed the
interest'' of the group, which also included the food companies

   Universities and research centers have turned computers back on
after sweeping out a ``virus'' epidemic that infected machines
across the country.
   Specialists said Friday the virus proved to be a nuisance and
slowed computers but apparently caused no damage.
   The virus is a sort of rogue program that reproduced in computers
and apparently instructed them to send copies of itself to other
machines through a research network, ARPANET.

   Unemployment fell to 5.3 percent in October _
matching a 14-year low _ the government said, as employers added
325,000 new jobs and floored the accelerator on an economy that had
been slowed by the summer drought.
   Friday's report was the last major economic report before
Tuesday's presidential election.
   The Labor Department said the 0.1 percentage point drop from
September's 5.4 percent jobless rate was accompanied by 99,000 new
manufacturing jobs, the biggest monthly increase in that employment
category since February 1984.

   The Federal Open Market Committee, which establishes monetary
policy for the central bank, voted 12-0 to make no further moves to
tighten credit conditions, a report made public Friday said.
   But officials let it be known the central bank still considered
higher inflation a greater threat to the economy than a possible

   U.S. officials say Britain's investigation of

PLC makes it unnecessary for the United States to look into whether
a merger of the two companies would endanger the supply of strategic
minerals.
   Under British law, Minorco's bid for Consolidated Gold Fields, a
British company, lapsed on Oct. 25 when it was referred to the
British Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
   The British government decided to investigate the offer after a
federal judge in New York issued an injunction against the deal
because it might violate U.S. antitrust law.

<HEAD>Purchasing Managers Say Economic Growth Quickened In October</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continued growth in production and orders helped
the economy accelerate in October after slowing the previous month,
according to the nation's purchasing managers.
   The Purchasing Managers Index rose to 56.8 in October from 54.8
in September, remaining below the year's peak of 59.3 in June, the
National Association of Purchasing Management said in a report
released Monday.
   An index above 50 percent generally indicates the economy is
expanding.
   In addition to the growth in production, new orders grew at a
slightly faster pace than in September, while new export orders rose
again and employment rose sharply, the group reported.
   ``Despite the apparent slowing in the growth rate of new export
orders, the continued high level of new orders, coupled with a
reduced inflation rate, suggests the fourth quarter economy will be
as good as the previous three,'' stated Robert J. Bretz, chairman of
the organization's Business Survey Committee.
   A number of economists closely watch the purchasing managers'
report because it gives solid clues to the direction of the economy.
   Production rose in October for the 27th consecutive month. The
index for production rose to 60.3, up sharply from September's 56.0,
which marked a slowdown from the 58.2 reading in August.
   The index for new orders rose to 58.9 from September's 58.4,
narrowly reversing a three-month string of declining growth rates
but trailing the 62.1 level of July.
   New export orders, a major element of recent economic growth,
grew in October but the pace slowed for the third straight month.
Among respondents who export, 26 percent reported higher export
orders, down slightly from 27 percent in September and sharply lower
than the 37.8 percent average for the first seven months of 1988.
The proportion reporting lower export orders rose to 8 percent, the
highest percentage this year and up from 6 percent in September.
   Employment rose sharply during the month, considering normal
seasonal variations, with the index jumping to a new 1988 high of
53.7 from September's 50.2 and reversing two consecutive months of
slowing growth.
   The employment index echoes the Labor Department's report on
Friday that U.S. unemployment fell to 5.3 percent in October,
matching a 14-year low as employers added 325,000 new jobs.
   Deliveries from vendors slowed for the 25th straight month _ an
indication that suppliers can't keep up with strong demand _
although a rise in the index to 55.6 from 55.0 in September
continues signaling that the rate of slowing is declining.
   Inventories declined slightly during October, after accounting
for normal seasonal variations, with the index dropping to 49.4 from
49.6.
   Prices rose during October, with more purchasers reporting price
increases than decreases for the 27th straight month. The index
dipped to 70.7 from 72.2 in September, however, indicating that the
rate of price increase slowed for the fourth straight month.
   The report is based on surveys of purchasing executives in more
than 250 industrial companies in 21 industries in all 50 states. The
organization has nearly 30,000 members.

   The dollar drifted lower in cautious late-morning
European trading today, but traders said they were not expecting
further major losses for the dollar ahead of the U.S. election
results. Gold prices rose in Europe.
   Traders in Italy said the dollar would remain fairly stationary
until the first indications of the result of the U.S. presidential
election Tuesday.
   One trader in Milan predicted a victory for Republican Vice
President George Bush should boost the dollar to around 1.82 West
German marks this week. But he said a win by Democratic candidate
Michael Dukakis would make the market immediately bearish toward the
dollar.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.44 Japanese yen to closing at 125.07 yen. Later in
London, it fell back to 124.85 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Friday's
prices, included: 1.7888 West German marks, down from 1.7955; 1.4990
Swiss francs, down from 1.5060; 6.1035 French francs, down from
6.1215; 2.0195 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0253; 1,328.75 Italian
lire, down from 1,332.50; and 1.2300 Canadian dollars, up from
1.2223.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.7705 from $1.7655 on
Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $421.75 a troy ounce, up
from $420.25 bid late Friday. At midmorning today, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $422.00.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $422.30, up from $420.50 bid late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 32 cents to close at $423.69.
   Silver bullion was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.43 a
troy ounce, up from Friday's $6.40.

   Share prices declined across the board today on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange while the dollar closed higher against the
Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 180.39
points, or 0.64 percent, to close at 27,866.36.
   The dollar opened at 125.28 yen, and ranged between 124.95 and
125.33 yen before closing at 125.07 yen. That was up 0.44 yen from
Friday's close of 124.63 yen.
   Securities dealers attributed the Nikkei's decline to
profit-taking following bullishness last week and the worsening
condition of Emperor Hirohito.
   The Nikkei index gained 85.74 points last week, surpassing the
28,000-mark for the first time in three months. The news that
Hirohito's condition worsened Sunday apparently discouraged bullish
sentiment of the market.
   ``The emperor's condition is once again making investors
nervous,'' said a dealer at Nikko Securities Co., speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``Many investors were profit-taking today
because they thought the bullishness of the market will not last
long because of the emperor's worsening illness.''
   The world's longest-reigning monarch has been gravely ill since
Sept. 19.
   On the foreign exchange market, exchange dealers said general
market sentiment showed the dollar is still bearish, but added many
players were remaining on the sidelines because of Tuesday's U.S.
presidential election.

   The respected oil newsletter said last month's production was up
from about 5 million barrels a day in September and 4.67 million
barrels a day in August.
   The Saudi Arabian production quota, set by the Organization o
Petroleum Exporting Countries, is 4.3 million barrels a day.
   But the Saudi Arabians are pumping extra oil in an effort to
force other OPEC members to cease exceding their own quotas.
   Overproduction has driven the price of oil in world markets down
by one third or more from the OPEC-set benchmark price of $18 a
barrel.

   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 11.3

   Volume was scant, with just 186.4 million shares changing hands

   Most traders said they expected the U.S. Republican candidate,
Vice President George Bush, to beat out his Democratic rival,
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, based upon Bush's favorable
showing in U.S. public opinion polls.
   But they said they weren't taking anything for granted, and
predicted a Bush victory would likely give the market a temporary
lift later this week.

<TEXT>
   MCorp and federal regulators have reached a
compromise over a planned government bailout that may keep the
financially troubled company out of bankruptcy court.
   Under the accord, announced on Sunday, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. said it wouldn't force MCorp to inject $400 million
into several of its subsidiary banks. In return, MCorp agreed to
open its books to potential buyers.
   The company indicated last week that it might have to file for
protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy
laws to avoid complying with the federal order.
   MCorp spokesman George McCane said the compromise ``reduces the
pressure of regulators that might force MCorp to reorganize.''
   ``The understanding we've achieved is a step forward to resolving
MCorp's capital needs,'' he said. ``It reflects a healthy level of
cooperation between the company, the Comptroller of the Currency and
the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System.''
   FDIC chairman L. William Seidman said the agreement ``will enable
the FDIC to work toward the most effective and least costly
resolution to MCorp's problems in a way that is consistent with the
legitimate interests of all parties concerned.''
   MCorp, the second-largest bank holding company in Texas, asked
the FDIC for assistance on Oct. 7 after reporting a third-quarter
loss of more than $500 million.
   At the time, the company proposed to inject into its troubled
bank subsidiaries $800 million, half of which would come from
private investors, if the FDIC provided financial assistance.
Analysts predicted MCorp would need about $1 billion from the
federal bank insurer.

   The stock market opened lower in quiet, early
trading today, as Wall Street awaited the presidential election and
continued to focus on last week's unexpectedly strong unemployment
figures.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 15.47 points at
2,130.33 after a half-hour of trading at 10 a.m. EST.
   Declining issues outpaced advancing ones by about 3 to 1 on the

unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 18.29 million shares after the
first 30 minutes of trading.
   Market analysts said Friday's low jobless rate continued to
influence this morning's market. The stronger October unemployment
data fueled concern that the economy is not slowing, as analysts had
predicted, and that the Federal Reserve could move to curb
inflationary pressures by tighening credit.
   In addition, analysts said the market is uneasy and is likely to
remain quiet before Tuesday's presidential election.
   ``Investors are watchful, waiting for the election and hoping
there won't be anything upsetting,'' said Larry Wachtel, a market
analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index was off 0.93 at
154.77. At the American Stock Exchange, the composite market index
fell 1.84 to 295.68.
   On Friday, The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 24.54

   Declining issues edged out advances by around 5 to 2 on the New

   Norman N. Newhouse, a low-profile newspaperman
who helped establish the world's largest family-owned communications
empire, died of a heart attack. He was 82.
   Newhouse died Sunday in his home.
   The family's holdings, now run by his nephews, include 26 U.S.
newspapers, Conde Nast magazines, major book publishers and cable TV
systems.
   Like his brothers, the late Samuel I. and Theodore Newhouse, he
shunned the limelight and was little known outside the newspaper
business.
   ``We never went in for titles,'' he said in a 1985 interview.
``We are, basically, anonymous people. If I were to walk into a room
in New Orleans with the 100 most prominent people in town, there may
be two who would know me personally. Most would probably know the
name and the connection, but they wouldn't know me personally or
recognize me by my face because my public position is non-existent.''
   For the past 20 years, Newhouse was based in New Orleans,
although much of his time was spent traveling to Alabama and Ohio to
visit Newhouse newspapers there. He did not take a role in the
day-to-day operations of The Times-Picayune, the Newhouse group's
paper in New Orleans.
   Newhouse kept a low profile in keeping with the philosophy he and
his brothers adhered to. That philosophy continued as other
generations of the Newhouse family moved into top management.
   Besides the newspapers, the family holdings _ now run by S.I.
Newhouse's two sons, Samuel I. Newhouse Jr. and Donald Newhouse _
include Vogue, Gourmet, Vanity Fair, HG, GQ and the New Yorker
magazines, the Parade Sunday newspaper supplement, the Random House
book publishing group and cable TV systems serving a million homes.
   Before moving to New Orleans in 1967, Newhouse was editor of the
now-defunct Long Island Press in New York and, before that, the
Staten Island (N.Y.) Advance.
   He started selling The Bayonne (N.J.) Times when he was 5. The
price was a penny a copy, and he was allowed to keep half, plus tips.
   S.I. Newhouse recalled that his brother quickly realized he could
sell more if he just held one paper and said, pleadingly, ``Mister,
please buy my last paper.'' As soon as he sold it, the fledgling
entrepreneur would run off to get another from a nearby stack.
   Newhouse attended New York University, and worked summers in the
classified and advertising departments at the Advance, which S.I.
Newhouse had bought in 1922. After graduation, he became a reporter,
and later city editor and managing editor.
   In 1937, when S.I. Newhouse bought The Long Island Press, Norman
went there as editor, his last title in the newspaper business.
   The Newhouse group had no formal management structure. The
Newhouse brothers simply met to discuss plans and problems, and if a
dispute arose, everyone deferred to S.I. Newhouse because he was the
eldest.
   ``We were his younger brothers,'' Norman Newhouse said. ``That
was all.''
   Besides the New Orleans operation, Norman Newhouse was
responsible for The Plain Dealer in Cleveland, The Birmingham (Ala.)
News, The Mobile (Ala.) Press, The Mobile Register, The Mississippi
Press in Pascagoula and The Huntsville (Ala.) Times and News.
   In 1971, doctors diagnosed Newhouse with leukemia and told him he
had five years to live. Newhouse said he never considered retirement
because nobody in his family ever did.
   Newhouse is survived by his wife, Alice Gross Newhouse; his
children; a sister and six grandchildren.

<TEXT>
   Allen Rosenshine, who was selected to head
Omnicom Group Inc. at its formation two years ago with the merger of
three advertising agencies, announced Monday that he is stepping
down to head one of its subsidiaries.
   The 49-year-old former ad copywriter said that, at his own
suggestion, he would become chief executive of BBDO Worldwide, an
Omnicom agency whose clients include Pepsi-Cola soft drinks, Apple
computers and General Electric lighting.
   Rosenshine will replace Norman W. Campbell, 54, who is retiring
as BBDO's chief executive. Rosenshine headed BBDO before the Omnicom
merger.
   Rosenshine said in a statement that the Omnicom board had
accepted his recommendation to name Bruce Crawford, 59, to succeed
Rosenshine as chief executive of Omnicom.
   Crawford had once headed BBDO but left at the end of 1985 to
become general manager of the Metropolitan Opera in New York.
   The changes will take effect as soon after Jan. 1 as possible,
depending on time required for orderly transitions within Omnicom,
BBDO and the Metropolitan Opera, the statement said.
   Rosenshine said Campbell had expressed a desire to retire as soon
as the post-merger transition could be completed.
   He told the board that since Crawford had indicated a desire to
return to the ad business, he felt it would be a good time to make
the changes.
   Omnicom was created in August 1986 with the merger of BBDO, Doyle
Dane Bernbach Group and Needham Harper Worldwide.
   As it is now set up, Omnicom oversees three separate agency
groups _ BBDO, DDB Needham and Diversified Agency Services _ which
have combined billings of more than $6 billion, making Omnicom one
of the world's largest ad companies.

   Volume on the Big Board totaled 40.87 million shares.
   Analysts said the market is likely to remain cautious before
Tuesday's presidential election, with many investors waiting on the
sidelines.
   ``There's a lot of uneasiness in the market today,'' said Larry
Wachtel, a market analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities.
``Investors are watchful, waiting for the election and hoping there
won't be anything upsetting.''
   In addition, analysts said Friday's unexpectedly low jobless rate
was among the factors contributing to this morning's weaker market.
   The stronger October unemployment data fueled concern that the
economy is not slowing, as analysts had predicted, and that the
Federal Reserve could move to curb inflationary pressures by raising
interest rates.

   The number of working oil and gas rigs rose by 19
this week to total 942, industry watcher Baker Hughes Inc. reported
Monday.
   The increase continues a seesaw trend, following a previous week
decline of 10 working rigs and an increase of eight two weeks ago. A
year ago, the count was 1,141, Baker Hughes said.
   The count is a widely watched industry index of drilling activity
and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of
last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the number of working rigs since 1940.
   In December 1981 at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10 per
42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the
rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes began
compiling figures.
   The lowest level this year was the reported 880 rigs on May 2.
   Among major oil producing states, Oklahoma saw the largest
increase with nine followed by North Dakota, four; Louisiana, three;
Kansas, Ohio and Pennsylvania, two each; and Michigan, one.
   States that saw declines include Colorado, four; New Mexico,
three; Wyoming, two; and California and Texas, one each.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Mostly Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in
volatile early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   All the markets opened lower, but then soybeans moved sharply
lower while wheat turned higher.
   ``It's a bloodbath here this morning'' in the soybean pit, said
Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in
Chicago. Soybeans for delivery in November fell 10 cents a bushel in
the first half-hour of trading.
   ``The market opened weaker than expected, then sold off
sharply,'' Lespinasse said. ``There's just a bearish mentality that
started after the bulls were unable to rally the market.''
   Some blamed the early soybean sell-off on disappointment over the
slow pace of grain sales for export. The Soviet Union bought a large
amount of U.S. soybeans and soybean meal last week, but the
Agriculture Department has not confirmed rumors of further large
Soviet purchases.
   In early trading, wheat was \ cent to 1{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.16{ a bushel; corn was 1\
cents to 2\ cents lower with December at $2.75} a bushel; oats were
2{ cents lower to 2\ cents higher with December at $2.14{ a bushel;
soybeans were 2} cents to 11 cents lower with November at $7.82 a
bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .23 cent lower to .08 cent higher with December
at 73.52 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .10 cent
higher with November at 81.60 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent
lower to .40 cent higher with December at 41.67 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .05 cent to .45 cent higher with February
at 46.60 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled higher on Friday.

   Japan retained its lead as the world's leader in
per capita savings last year, beating out the thrifty Swiss for a
second straight year, an international survey published Monday found.
   The study by the International Savings Banks Institute said each
Japanese citizen on average saved $38,439 by the end of 1987, an
increase of $11,136 over the previous year.
   Switzerland, formerly the longtime leader, recorded per capita
savings of $34,763, an increase of about $9,500.
   The U.S. savings rate is $9,888, up from $9,529 in 1986.
   The report cited the strong value of the yen and Swiss franc
against the dollar as the main factors contributing to the high
figures.
   The 35-nation survey counted only bank savings.
   Switzerland was followed by Belgium with $17,987, West Germany
with $16,102 and Austria with $13,269.
   The report said that savings remained at a ``good level due to a
generally good control of inflation in several countries, the good
economic performance average and ... a small decrease in
unemployment.''
   It also said volumes of savings in many countries surveyed showed
``substantial growth, especially after the fluctuations on the stock
exchange markets last year which led savers to come back to more
traditional ways of investing.''
   The countries with the lowest per capita savings according to the
study, were Niger with $7, Ethiopia with $18 and Senegal with $69.

   Stock prices declined sharply in light to
moderate trading today, as concern about Tuesday's presidential
election and what could come afterward dominated the market.
   The market opened lower and continued to decline as skittish
investors withdrew from buying and selling in anticipation of
Tuesday's outcome.
   ``We're not seeing a lot of selling but just a lot of people not
buying,'' said Philip Puccio, senior vice president at Dillon, Read
& Co.
   Early in the day, analysts said some investors had decided to
reduce their stock portfolios before Tuesday's vote.
   ``People came in in a selling mood today,'' said Charles Jensen,
an analyst with MKI Securities Corp.
   But while the presidential election appeared to be the dominating
force in today's market, some observers said the market's weakness
suggested that many investors were already looking beyond the
election and to wat could come afterward.
   Late last week, the stock market lost ground as new economic data
indicating the economy might be growing faster than expected revived
fears of higher inflation and interest rates.
   Some analysts had predicted that the Federal Reserve would wait
until after the election to put the skids on inflation by raising
interest rates.
   ``What is happening today is an extension of the anxieties that
hit the market last week,'' said Michael Metz, an analyst with
Oppenheimer & Co.
   Weaker bond prices and lower transport stock prices also weighed
heavily on today's stock market, analysts said.
   ``The bond market is leading our market...,'' Puccio said. ``I
would be worried if I saw a bigger trading volume, but it's very
slow...''
   The stronger October unemployment data renewed concern that the
economy may be heating up, signaling higher inflation and interest
rates if the Federal Reserve moves to tighten credit.

<HEAD>CD Investors Pick Bush To Win</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A landslide victory for George Bush is already in the bank, so to
speak.
   In a gimmick to attract deposit dollars, a handful of banks and
thrifts nationwide have offered investors bonus interest rates on
certificates of deposits based on the outcome of Tuesday's
presidential election.
   And if that money talks, Bush wins.
   At the Regency Savings Bank in Naperville, Ill., customers with a
minimum of $2,000 to invest had three months to put their money in
either a one-year CD for Bush or his Democratic challenger,
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   Holders of the winning ``Presidential Election CD'' would receive
an extra 0.5 percent interest, which would mean a jump to 7.75
percent from 7.25 percent when the CD was first offered.
   Marketing assistant Carol Johnson said that as of Saturday, the
purchasing cutoff date, a whopping 93.75 percent of all $3 million
in sales were for Bush CDs, with Dukakis getting the rest.
   ``Bush has always been ahead, but it seems to me it's gone up
quite a bit over the last couple of weeks,'' Ms. Johnson said.
   Not too surprisng for Naperville, an affluent Chicago suburb that
is heavily Republican.
   In the Washington, D.C., area, Perpetual Savings Bank had similar
results for its ``Presidential Certificate of Deposits.''
   Robert Barton, senior vice president of investor relations, said
that as of the Saturday cutoff, 63 percent of the thrift's
approximately $3 million in sales of two- and four-year CDs were
Republican.
   Barton said the margin was a lot narrower when the CDs were first
offered in September and widened in recent weeks.
   At Perpetual, depositors of both persuasions are eligible for a
bonus regardless of who wins the election. The thrift will award
bonus interest to all depositors, up to a maximum of 0.5 percent,
based on the winner's margin of victory in the popular vote.
   Robert K. Heady, publisher of the North Palm Beach, Fla.,
newsletter Bank Rate Monitor, said these special CD sales have
broken some new ground.
   ``Politics has replaced the toaster as the hottest bank premium
of the fall of 1988,'' he said.

   The dollar finished sharply lower Monday against
all major currencies except the Canadian dollar as traders were
reluctant to take positions ahead of the presidential election.
   Gold prices rose. Republic National Bank of New York said gold
bullion was bid at $422.25 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, up
slightly from $421.50 on Friday.
   The dollar finished lower in European trading and continued to
drift steadily downward as activity shifted to the United States.
Despite the depth of the currency's drop, the tone in the currency
markets was quiet.
   Traders said the dollar was undermined by new polls that showed
Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis narrowing the lead
held by Republican Vice President George Bush.
   The market perceives a Bush win would be mildly bullish for the
dollar, although traders are at a loss for a clear explanation as to
why such a victory would support the currency.
   ``Regardless of who is becoming president, the market feels the
dollar should go lower,'' said Stephen Flanagan, an assistant vice
president at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   Traders around the world predicted there would be no substantial
move in the dollar until after the election.
   ``There will be no major position-taking before the election,
although the market retains its bearish tint,'' said Jeff
Mondschein, manager of foreign exchange at Chicago-based Continental
Illinois National Bank & Trust Co.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.44 yen to a closing 125.07 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a lower rate of 124.68 yen. In New York, the dollar
fell to yen 124.63, from 124.93 yen on Friday.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.7755 dollars to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.7655 late
Friday. In New York it cost $1.7804 to buy one pound, more expensive
than Friday's $1.7661.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday,
included: 1.7772 West German marks, down from 1.7910; 1.4887 Swiss
francs, down from 1.5013; 6.0675 French francs, down from 6.1188;
1,320.38 Italian lire, down from 1,330.50, and 1.2358 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.2231.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday,
included: 1.7840 West German marks, down from 1.7955; 1.4965 Swiss
francs, down from 1.5060; 6.0815 French francs, down from 6.1215;
2.0148 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0253; 1,327.75 Italian lire, down
from 1,332.50, and 1.2374 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2223.
   Gold prices moved higher. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold
finished at $422.80 a troy ounce, up from $421.50 on Friday.
   In London the metal rose to a late bid of $421.75 a troy ounce,
compared with late Friday's $420.25. In Zurich, gold rose, closing
at a bid $420.65, compared with $420.50 late Friday. Earlier in Hong
Kong, gold was bid at $421.95 a troy ounce, up from $420.25 on
Friday.
   Silver bullion prices finished at $6.490 a troy ounce on New

<TEXT>
   Last week's computer virus attack, the biggest
ever, has caught the attention of leaders in business and government
and should lead to improvements in computer security, several
consultants said Monday.
   But the top officials, who ordinarily relegate security matters
to lower-level employees, may be disturbed to find how expensive and
inconvenient it can be to make their computers less vulnerable to a
virus attack.
   ``I'm not sure there's a willingness to pay the check to do all
the things that would have to be done to really close down all the
loopholes,'' said Steven Ross, senior manager for information
protection services at the accounting and consulting firm of
Deloitte Haskins & Sells.
   Security consultants said they had received far more inquiries
than usual since the end of last week. But they said computer
security is a wide-ranging matter that cannot be solved simply by
assigning passwords and installing some anti-viral software.
   The attachment of computers into far-flung networks, a pervasive
trend of the 1980s, has made each individual computer far more
vulnerable to penetration from an outsider.
   Jon David, a computer security consultant in Tappan, N.Y., said
businesses that had contacted him for help seemed to underestimate
the challenge.
   ``The amazing thing is, the attitude I'm getting is, `Why don't
you stop by for a day or two and tell us how to protect ourselves
from viruses?''' he said.
   Several consultants said last week's virus attack, which infected
6,000 computers in the Arpanet research network, heightened the
consciousness of senior managers in a way that smaller previous
attacks had not.
   The virus clogged computers at universities and research
institutes by spreading from one computer to another by electronic
mail and making repeated copies of itself. It did not damage any
data and was eventually erased.
   ``The real culprit (in lax security) is management. Management
has finally become aware of what can happen to them,'' said Thomas
Prugh, executive vice president for science and technology at
Information Security International Inc. in Silver Spring, Md.
   Prugh said computer security had probably been on a steady
downtrend since the 1950s, when each computer was isolated in a
locked room and only a handful of people were able or permitted to
use it.
   Prugh said the downward trend in security probably reversed
earlier this year, when awareness of the vulnerability of networked
computers began to grow.
   But Prugh, and others, said there is a long way to go.
   ``This was all very predictable well in advance. The problem
stems not from fantastic genius but from fantastic stupidity,'' said
Ross, of Deloitte Haskins & Sells.
   Ross said he expected boards of directors to take note of the
security threats. But he said there were also signs of emerging
complacency in some quarters.
   ``The reaction already is that this is an isolated instance, this
is a boy genius, you can't prevent this, and besides, no harm was
done,'' Ross said.
   ``The only reason all the world's computers haven't crashed at
the same time is because they aren't yet networked together,''
Lincoln D. Faurer, president of the Corporation for Open Systems
International, said in a recent speech. He said he intended the
remark as a joke with a message.
   ``We've got some pretty powerful tools. (But) we're not using
those tools,'' said George Hertzberg, a specialist in computer
security at Fairleigh Dickinson University in Rutherford, N.J.
   The problem is that most kinds of security make things more
time-consuming and inconvenient for computer users, and the users'
job evaluations are based on how productive they are, Hertzberg said.
   ``When you try to implement any kind of control procedure, you
are immediately confronted by those people who say, `Hey, I've got a
job to get done. You're slowing the system down. You're getting in
the way.''
   Even kinds of security that would not slow down the users have
not been adequately pursued, according to a study last year based on
a survey by Ernst & Whinney of 400 data-processing professionals out
of 1,200 at a computer security conference.
   Nine percent of the respondents said they had lost $50,000 to $1
million because of systems failures or downtime in the previous
year, while another 2 percent said their losses exceeded $1 million.
Those losses were unrelated to security breaches.
   But when asked about their contingency planning for failures or
downtime, 40 percent said it was irregular or non-existent, said
David R. Wilson, Ernst & Whinney's national director of information
systems consulting.
   ``Every major corporation in the country, especially those that
tie into open networks, are taking looks at their systems to see if
they're vulnerable. And of course what they'll discover is that they
are vulnerable,'' Wilson said.

<HEAD>TWA President Resigns Post; New Structure Announced</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trans World Airlines Inc. announced Monday that
its president has resigned and the company is restructuring its top
management.
   TWA, which was privatized on Oct. 24, said President D. Joseph
Corr is resigning effective Nov. 30.
   Corr won't be directly replaced as president, the airline said. A
new three-man ``office of the chairman'' will be created to combine
both executive and operational functions.
   The new office will consist of TWA's current chairman and owner,
financier Carl Icahn; Alfred Kingsley, a member of the board of
directors; and Jerry Nichols, senior vice president for ground
operations at TWA.
   Under the new setup, Icahn will continue as chairman and chief
executive officer, Kingsley will still be called a director and
Nichols will become executive vice president.
   About 15 vice presidents will report directly to the three-man
team.
   ``This structure will do away with unnecessary layers of
management, and will give much more autonomy and responsibility to
the vice presidents in the field,'' Icahn said in a statement.
   Corr will remain on the boards of both TWA and ACF Industries
Inc., a railcar leasing company owned by Icahn. His future plans
include the purchase of a company, as yet unnamed, in which Icahn
expects to invest, TWA said.
   Corr was recently mentioned in published reports as one of the
parties interested in buying troubled Eastern Airlines from parent
Texas Air Corp., which recently sold Eastern's shuttle service to
developer Donald Trump for $365 million in cash.
   Last month, Icahn broke off efforts to acquire the rest of
Eastern, after failing to structure a deal that would satisfy the
airline's militant unions.
   Icahn said Monday that while he is happy with TWA's financial
turnaround since he took over the company, it still faces many
challenges in the future.
   ``There was no question TWA must grow to thrive, and ... by far
the most preferable way for the airline to grow is through
acquisitions,'' he said.
   Icahn also said that, unless TWA makes an acquisition of ``major
importance'' _ and possibly even if it does _ the airline will order
30 to 60 new narrow-body planes in the next three to six months.
   Mark Buckstein, the airline's general counsel, said recently that
TWA plans to lease or buy about 60 new aircraft to upgrade its aging
fleet, at a cost of up to $1.5 billion.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Fall Sharply On Rise In London Inventory</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices fell sharply Monday on New York's Commodity
Exchange after the London Metal Exchange reported an increase in its
warehouse stocks of copper for the first time in two months.
   It was the third price decline in as many sessions but analysts
were divided on the significance of the buildup in copper stocks in
London.
   On other markets, precious metals gained; grains were mostly
higher while soybeans finished lower; livestock and meat were mixed;
energy futures rose and stock-index futures retreated.
   U.S. copper futures traders had been expecting the London Metal
Exchange to report a decline of 5,000 to 10,000 metric tons last
week in the amount of copper stored in exchange-sanctioned
warehouses.
   Instead, the exchange said stocks rose 125 metric tons to 70,925
metric tons. It was the first increase since Sept. 5, when the
exchange reported inventories totaling 122,125 metric tons.
   The report startled copper traders on New York's Comex who had
grown jittery after bidding the metal's spot price to an all-time
high of $1.538 a pound last week.
   Copper for spot delivery settled 3.35 cents lower at $1.4565 a
pound Monday on the Comex while the most active futures contract,
for December delivery, was 3.1 cents lower at $1.389 a pound.
   The report of a 125-ton rise in copper stocks ``really caused the
market to move lower,'' said Bette Raptopoulos, metals analyst in
New York with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   But Ms. Raptopoulos said the bull market's fundamental
underpinnings _ tight supplies, strong demand and a 3-week-old
copper miners' strike in Peru _ remained in place, suggesting prices
could recover and advance to new highs.
   Craig Sloane, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.,
said the unexpected rise in copper inventories should be viewed as a
caution light.
   ``It is significant in that it breaks the trend of sizeable
declines that's been going on for two months,'' Sloane said.
   ``The slight increase should not be thrown out as something
meaningless,'' he said. ``It could very well be the start of
something new _ but I wouldn't bet the whole farm on it.''
   Precious-metals prices advanced on the Comex amid strong overseas
buying spurred by the dollar's decline against other currencies,
analysts said.
   Gold settled $1.20 to $1.60 higher with December at $424.70 a
troy ounce; silver was 6.5 cents to 7.6 cents higher with December
at $6.53 a troy ounce.
   Grain and soybean futures finished mixed on the Chicago Board of
Trade with grains mostly higher and soybeans mostly lower.
   The soybean market settled near the day's highs, though, on
speculation that the Soviet Union was planning large purchases of
U.S. soybeans and soybean meal, experts said.
   After the close, the Agriculture Department confirmed that the
Soviet Union had purchased 300,000 metric tons of U.S. soybean meal.
   The grain markets had opened lower on disappointment about the
lack of new export business. But most prices rebounded late in the
session on a news report that the No. 2 official in the Soviet
grain-buying agency had said the Soviet Union would need to buy 1
million metric tons of U.S. soybeans or soymeal for both February
and March delivery, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   ``There was just an explosion in the meal market in the last
minute or so,'' he said.
   Wheat settled 1\ cents lower to 3\ cents higher with December at
$4.19 a bushel; corn was unchanged to 2\ cents higher with December
at $2.78} a bushel; oats were 6 cents to 8 cents higher with
December at $2.25 a bushel; soybeans were 3{ cents lower to 2 cents
higher with November at $7.88{ a bushel.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle settled .15 cent
lower to .28 cent higher with December at 73.60 cents a pound;
feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .35 cent higher with November
at 81.45 cents a pound; hogs were .30 cent lower to .37 cent higher
with December at 42.12 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .22
cent lower to .13 cent higher with February at 46.12 cents a pound.
   Energy futures posted moderate gains on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 2 cents to 15 cents higher
at $14.06 barrel; heating oil was .05 cent to .37 cent higher with
December at 44.13 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .17 cent to
.91 cent higher with December at 47.25 cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures retreated moderately on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, where the contract for December delivery of the
Standard & Poor's 500 settled 1.55 points lower at 274.70.

   Stock prices tumbled in light trading Monday as
weary investors awaited the outcome of the presidential election.
   The Dow Jones Industrial average lost 21.16 points to close the
day at 2,124.64.
   In the broader market, declining issues outpaced advances by
nearly 4 to 1 in nationwide trading of New York Stock
Exchange-listed stocks, with 1,200 issues down, 314 up and 444
unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 133.87 million shares,
down from 143.58 million in Friday's session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at
regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled
171.01 million shares.
   Analysts said investors withdrew from the market early, neither
buying nor selling, to await the outcome of Tuesday's vote. Analysts
said that while Wall Street felt relatively certain of a George Bush
victory, investors were cautious after weekend polls suggested
Michael Dukakis had narrowed the gap in some areas.
   In addition, leftover concern from last week's unexpectedly
strong unemployment data also kept investors watchful. The drop in
the jobless rate revived concern that the economy is stronger than
expected, signaling the possibility of higher inflation and a move
by the Federal Reserve to tighten credit by raising interest rates.
   Later in the day, many observers said a no-win sentiment seemed
to grip the market as investors turned to post-election concerns.
   ``The market has so baked George Bush into the pie that if he is
victorious, it will be anti-climactic and the market will say `So
what,''' said Larry Wachtel, an analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. ``The big story will be after the election.''
   Another analyst said investors worried that regardless of who
wins the elections, concerns about the economy will persist.
   ``Even with a Bush victory, we're faced with rising inflation,
higher interest rates, concerns about the federal deficit _ the same
questions about the economy,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, vice
president for A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ``You'll have
trouble finding anyone who thinks either Bush or Dukakis has
developed a sense of coming to grips with these things.''
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
1.42 to close at 154.28.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, Sears Roebuck dropped ~
point to 43}, IBM fell 1[ to 119[ and Pillsbury was off 1] at 59.
Pillsbury said it was spinning of its Burger King unit.
   RJR Nabisco, in the middle of a takeover battle, rose 1} to 87],
and Ford gained 1] to 51.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index closed down 2.73 to 315.36,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index lost 2.38 to finish at 273.93.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
declined 4.51 to 376.51.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was down
4.05 to close at 293.47.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market was $2,700.163 billion Monday off
26.089 billion or off 0.96 percent from Friday.

<HEAD>Turner Sells CNN Center For $170 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ted Turner announced Monday the sale of CNN Center
for $170 million, almost three times what he paid for the struggling
office-hotel-shopping complex when he bought it two years ago and
renamed it after his Cable News Network.
   The complex was purchased by 66 Properties Inc., a unit of The
Herrick Co., a Morristown, N.J.-based real estate investment firm.
   Turner will use the proceeds to pay down the massive debt rung up
by the $1.5 billion purchase in 1986 of the MGM film library.
   The deal includes 800,000 square feet in two office towers, one
of which houses Turner Broadcasting Inc. headquarters and the CNN
studios located on balconies in the atrium between the two
buildings; the 470-room Omni International Hotel; 80,000 square feet
of retail space; and an adjacent parking building with 2,000 spaces.
   Turner, looking for money to reduce his debt, had announced in
February that the building was for sale, and within the past few
months is known to have rejected a Japanese-led syndicate's offer of
$160 million.
   Turner purchased the property in 1986 for $21.8 million in cash
and assumption of $45 million in debt.
   The deal does not include TBS' operating agreement for The Omni
coliseum, adjacent to the complex.
   ``We're going to do whatever has to be done to make it a
first-class property,'' president Norton Herrick said in a telephone
interview from the buyer's Boca Raton, Fla., offices.
   Turner signed a 15-year lease to remain the main tenant in the
complex, which will be managed by Tishman West Management Group of
Los Angeles. Turner said the deal would be closed within 60 days.
   The purchase is the second major transaction this year involving
a premier downtown Atlanta property.
   In September, architect-developer John Portman consolidated his
ownership of the six-building Peachtree Center complex for $333
million in the city's largest-ever real estate transaction.
   In addition, a Japanese insurance company is believed to be near
closing a $300 million deal for the IBM Tower, the city's latest
showpiece skyscraper.

   A meeting between Polaroid Corp. and
Shamrock Holdings Inc. failed to settle a legal dispute over
Shamrock's hostile takeover bid for the instant camera company,
Polaroid said Monday.
   The meeting Sunday explored a possible settlement but ``because
of fundamental differences between the parties, no agreement was
reached,'' Polaroid said in a brief statement. The company refused
to provide any details.
   Shamrock is suing Polaroid in Delaware Chancery Court seeking to
invalidate Polaroid's employee stock ownership plan, which would all
but block a takeover.
   Shamrock made a hostile $42-a-share offer for Polaroid in
September after the camera company rebuffed two unsolicited bids.
The offer values Polaroid at about $2.6 billion.

<HEAD>Largest Newsprint Maker Reduces, Delays Price Hike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's largest newsprint maker, pressured by
weak demand and resistance from American newspapers, said Monday it
would drastically reduce and delay its latest announced price hike.
   Abitibi-Price Inc. of Toronto has told its customers it decided
to increase prices for newspaper customers by $30 to $680 a metric
ton effective Feb. 1 instead of the previously announced $695 a
metric ton.
   But analysts said that unless two smaller U.S.-based newsprint
makers announce price increases by next month, this latest rise
might not occur.
   Last September, Abitibi announced it was raising its newsprint
prices to $695 a metric ton, a 6.9 percent increase, effective Jan
1. Several other manufacturers, including Bowater Inc., the largest
U.S. producer, followed suit.
   But newspaper officials balked, arguing that the price hikes were
unjustified because of weak demand for newsprint. They said a fall
in advertising meant they did not need as much paper to print their
newspapers.
   They also said a buildup of inventories and increased capacity of
paper mills starting next year meant a larger supply of newsprint
would be available. ``We are obviously disappointed that our price
announcement for both the U.S. and Canada have had to be modified
or, I should say, has been modified,'' said Robert Johnson, senior
vice president of marketing for Abitibi's sales and marketing unit
in New York. ``But we are obviously aware of the realities of the
marketplace.''
   Canadian Pacific Forest Products Ltd. of Toronto was the first to
announce last week that it was cutting its previously announced
price increase.
   But analysts said Champion International Corp. of Stamford,
Conn., and Kimberly-Clark Corp. of Dallas started the ball rolling
on Nov. 1 when they did not notify their customers that they would
follow the lead of Abitibi and other bigger newsprint companies that
announced their price increases in September.
   Under terms of their customer contracts, both companies were
required to give two months notice of price hikes. Most other
newsprint makers operate under contracts that require three months
notice to customers.
   ``The only way these companies can compete is in price,'' said
one Wall Street analyst who did not want to be named. ``If one
company increases its price and the next does not then (the company
with the higher price) will lose market share.''
   The analyst said the big newsprint makers boosted prices on the
assumption that fourth-quarter demand would increase. However, that
has not happened and ``that's why Champion decided not to increase
prices,'' he said.
   Analysts said that the two companies have until Dec. 1 to meet
the latest price hike for their customers. If they do not, that
could mean even the lower prices might not take effect, they said.
   ``The handwriting is on the wall,'' said Eric Philo, an analyst
with the investment firm Goldman, Sachs & Co. ``It looks like there
will be excess capacity in the next few years.''

   OTASCO Inc., a 70-year-old Tulsa-based retail
chain, filed for bankruptcy reorganization and has closed 170 stores
in 11 states, company officials announced Monday.
   Jerry Goodman, chairman and chief executive officer of the
company, said the Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition was filed Sunday
night in federal court in Tulsa.
   Company stores did not open Monday and 1,600 employees were
advised they were being terminated, he said.
   Goodman said Otasco, purchased by its employees four years ago,
had $187 million in assets and $163 million in liabilities, with
secured debt of $94 million and $50 million in unsecured debt.
   He said company officials had been unable to negotiate a
settlement with Otasco's bankers.
   Among Otasco's largest creditors are Ameritrust Co. of Cleveland,
$22.6 million; General Electric Co., $10.5 million; MTD Products,
$6.4 million; and Uniroyal Inc., $5.8 million.
   AmeriTrust issued a statement Monday saying it was the lead
lender in an $86 million secured loan agreement with OTASCO, but
that six participating lenders have assumed all but $22.6 million of
that liability.
   Goodman said the decision to file for Chapter 11 was made because
the company did not have funds to purchase Christmas inventory.
   Otasco, which specializes in automotive products and appliances,
has been struggling in recent years, in part because of the
depressed oil and agriculture industries in its markets, Goodman
said.
   Otasco was started in 1918 and grew to a chain of more than 600
company-owned and associate stores in a 14-state area in the
southeastern and south central United States.
   It was purchased by McCrory Corp. in 1961 and four years ago was
bought back by employees to become the fourth-largest employee owned
company in the country.
   The name of the company is an abbreviation for Oklahoma Tire and
Supply Co.
   Two years ago the company undertook a restructuring plan in which
it reduced debt, closed 94 unprofitable stores, liquidated a
discount outlet store and consolidated warehouse and distribution
facilities.
   Goodman, who became president and chief executive officer in
1983, said he hoped the company will be reorganized into ``a smaller
company, but probably a more viable company than we have been in the
past.''
   About 250 employees, including managers of Otasco stores,
remained on the payroll to service customer accounts during the
reorganization transition, Goodman said. He said customer services
would be maintained.
   Goodman said he believed the company could be reorganized to
pursue a new strategy that will allow it to compete with large
discount store chains.
   In addition to Oklahoma, Otasco has stores in Alabama, Arkansas,
Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, South Carolina,
Tennessee and Texas.

<TEXT>
   Church's Fried Chicken Inc.'s board of
directors on Monday rejected as inadequate a $290 million takeover
offer by rival Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken and Biscuits and said it
would file a federal court suit to block the bid.
   The board of San Antonio-based Church's, the nation's
second-largest fried chicken chain behind Kentucky Fried Chicken,
also indicated it had instructed management to explore alternatives
to the $8 a share Popeye's offer, including a possible leveraged
buyout, merger with another suitor or major acquisition by Church's.
   Church's had been studying the offer Popeyes' parent company, A.
Copeland Enterprises Inc. of New Orleans for about two weeks.
   Church's shares dipped 25 cents to $7.75 a share Monday on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   Church's also announced a shareholder protection plan aimed at
making a hostile takeover more difficult and said it would file a
counterclaim in Louisiana federal court to stop Popeyes from
pursuing the takeover offer.
   Popeyes spokesman Mark McKinnon said the company would stand by
its offer.
   ``We are disappointed. We still want a friendly deal and would
sign a confidentiality agreement to get more information about the
company,'' McKinnon said. ``The bottom line is we are not going
away.''
   McKinnon said the company believed Church's legal motions were
unfounded and company officials believed they could lead Church's to
greater profitability.
   Church's officials also have filed motions in federal court in
San Antonio seeking a declaratory judgment upholding the shareholder
rights plan.
   The shareholder rights plan, commonly known as a poison pill,
enables Church's shareholders to sharply increase their holdings in
the company in the event a hostile bidder acquires a stake of 20
percent or more, and to buy at a discount stock in the hostile
bidder if it wins control of Church's. Such plans are aimed at
making a hostile buyout prohibitively expensive.
   ``This is a program that's designed not to prevent a takeover,
but to encourage a potential buyer to negotiate properly for the
benefit of the shareholder,'' said Ernest Renaud, Church's president
and chief executive officer.
   ``It makes the potential buyer go back and do his homework on the
offer and allows the board time to look at the takeover offer and
not to stampede into it,'' Renaud said.
   Church's also said it would be filing an answer and counterclaims
in Louisiana federal court against Copeland and other individuals.
   The counterclaims hope to keep Copeland from continuing its offer
on charges that it would violate securities and antitrust laws and
also alleges former Church's employees used confidential information
regarding Church's.
   Church's, which has gone through management changes the last
several years, expects sales of around $520 million this year from
its more than 1,500 restaurants, down from about $570 million in
1986 and $633 million in 1984.
   Popeyes, the No. 3 chicken restaurant, expects sales of $485
million this year. There are 725 Popeyes restaurants nationwide, 100
of them company-owned.

<HEAD>Brennan Says Sears Stores Will Change, But Not Become `Discount'

<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. may be adopting a
``low-cost mentality'' under its recently-announced restructuring,
but that doesn't mean it will be running a chain of discount stores,
Sears' chairman said Monday.
   A new policy of ``every day low pricing,'' plus other changes,
will instead mean far fewer promotional sales, and in some cases
fewer choices of products in Sears stores, said company Chairman
Edward Brennan.
   ``We intend to take our current mix of merchandise and go to a
low, every-day price strategy with that mix,'' Brennan told a group
of securities analysts and reporters at Sears Tower in Chicago.
   ``Don't feel like we are going to be something that looks like a
discounter,'' with shopping carts and check-out counters at the
doors, he said.
   A ``significant increase'' in the number of Sears retail stores _
now about 825 _ also could occur in coming years, he said.
   Sears officials announced last week they would revamp
merchandising and sell the 110-story Sears Tower, the world's
tallest building, in a bid to improve the company's earnings. No
buyers for the building have been announced.
   Company officials also revealed plans to move the company's
Merchandise Group out of Sears Tower, meaning 8,000 jobs could be
relocated.
   ``We would like to keep the organization here in Chicago and we
will do everything possible to make that happen,'' Brennan said
Monday. But he added, ``We think it's our responsibility to the
shareholders to explore all options.''
   The restructuring is intended to have Sears employees adopt a
``low-cost mentality,'' and ``the signal of moving our headquarters
is a huge, huge step in that direction,'' Brennan said.
   Michael Bozic, chairman of the Merchandise Group, said at the
meeting that lessening the number of promotional sales on individual
items, could save the company up to $200 million a year through
reduced paperwork, inventory handling and related costs.
   Brennan said the marketing strategy also should mean better
return for advertising dollars.
   Sears has said that under the restructuring, it also would buy
back up to 10 percent of its stock, divest its Coldwell Banker
commercial real estate subsidiary and take $425 million in after-tax
fourth-quarter charges.
   Brennan said last week that the restructuring is designed to
enhance Sears' value to shareholders immediately and to concentrate
its resources over the longer term on consumer-oriented businesses:
retailing, insurance, real estate and financial services.
   Sears also plans to continue trying out other new marketing
techniques, including offering more national brands of some types of
products and opening specialty stores.
   Sears net income in the third quarter was $344.2 million, or 90
cents per share. That compared with $409 million, or $1.08 a share,
for third-quarter 1987.

   Halliburton Co. said Monday its third quarter
profit rose 22 percent from the same period last year.
   The company, one of the world's biggest oilfield services
concerns, posted a profit of $25.3 million, or 24 cents a share, for
the three months ended Sept. 30. In 1987, the company reported third
quarter earnings of $20.7 million, or 19 cents a share.
   Revenue during the quarter rose to $1.2 billion from $1.0 billion
in the year-earlier quarter.
   For the nine-month period, earnings were $81.8 million, or 78
cents a share, compared with $14 million, or 13 cents a share, for
the same period last year.
   Nine month revenue rose to $3.5 billion from $2.7 billion in the
same period months last year.

<HEAD>Kroger Settles With Some Shareholders in Restructuring Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>

   Kroger Co. said Monday it had reached an
out-of-court settlement with 11 of 14 shareholders who sued to block
the company's $4.6 billion restructuring program, although three
shareholders will fight the deal.
   The shareholders filed six class-action lawsuits after Kroger on
Sept. 15 announced plans to restructure to discourage two
unsolicited takeover proposals.
   The suits, consolidated into one, accuse Kroger executives of
trying to protect their jobs by the restructuring.
   Under the plan, shareholders will get a special $40 cash dividend
and a bond with a trading value of about $8 for each share they own.
   Kroger officials said they decided to settle to ``avoid further
expense, inconvenience and distraction.''
   The settlement, if approved by the Hamilton County Common Pleas
Court, would accelerate the maturity of the bonds by two years to
Oct. 15, 2006, and make other changes in how quickly Kroger must
redeem the bonds.
   It also would prohibit the company from redeeming bonds before
Oct. 15, 1993.
   Kroger will pay a premium _ in the form of a percentage of
between 1 and 3 points more than face value _ on bonds it redeems
between 1993 and 1996. The premium would be paid in addition to any
accrued interest.
   Kroger spokesman Paul Bernish said a court hearing on the
settlement should be set for mid- to late-December.
   Attorney Gene Mesh, representing three shareholders, said he
would file formal objections to the settlement because it does not
give shareholders any additional benefits.
   He said he wants further restrictions on when Kroger may redeem
the bonds and wants the company to pay a higher premium for
redeeming them early.
   Mesh contended that the settlement, in which Kroger has agreed to
pay $1.27 million to the plaintiffs' lawyers, was ``carved out only
to satisfy the attorney fees.''

   A graduate student believed responsible for a computer ``virus''
that jammed an estimated 6,000 systems nationwide last week has
obtained a lawyer, and sources said Monday that the FBI upgraded its
inquiry to a full criminal investigation.
   Cornell University computer experts said a weekend of
troubleshooting left them with little evidence to conclude that
Robert T. Morris Jr. was the source of the rogue program, despite
one official's comment that an early version of the program was
found in Morris' files.
   Morris, 23, isn't saying anything publicly, other than a fleeting
remark to a television station that all the attention has become ``a
bit terrifying.''
   The ``virus,'' so named because it multiplies after invading a
computer, jammed computers across the country linked to the
Pentagon-supported Arpanet network, slowing computers by reproducing
itself over and over.
   Those computer centers affected by the virus say it only took up
memory space and did not destroy any files.
   A federal government source familiar with the case who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said Justice Department officials had
decided to step up the FBI's involvement in the case from a
preliminary inquiry to a full-scale criminal investigation of Morris
and the events surrounding the virus.
   The Washington Post, in its Tuesday editions, quoted law
enforcement sources as saying that the inquiry had been expanded to
a full field investigation by the FBI's Washington field office.
   The paper said that meant FBI officials had consulted with
federal prosecutors and agreed that the FBI had jurisdiction and
that there was reason to believe there may have been a violation of
federal criminal law.
   FBI spokesman Charles Steinmetz declined to give details on the
case's progress, but said FBI officials probably had talked with the
U.S. attorney's office over the weekend.
   In a full-scale investigation, the government has the power to
subpoena records and documents and compel testimony through the
authorization of immunity, two techniques which are not permitted
through preliminary inquiries. The move indicated the FBI was moving
very quickly in the case because in many instances, preliminary
inquiries take a month or more.
   Justice sources said the FBI was trying on Monday to get an
interview with Morris and apparently had not done so by the end of
the day.
   Another government source, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said investigators were not sure whether any criminal activity
actually occurred, as defined by a statute passed in 1984.
   A section of that law says it is unlawful to enter a government
computer with the intent to disrupt its functions. The crime is
punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
   The source said that in this case, there's no evidence that
anything was taken from the computers, but rather that it was a
question of disrupting computer systems.
   One section of law addresses sabotage, but the source said it was
unclear whether the virus case would involve an intent to disrupt
the computer.
   The source said he believed the bureau was investigating the
matter in view of the fact that there were breaches of security, and
that the Justice Department will have to determine whether the
matter involved criminal conduct.
   ``There's a lot of ambiguity'' in the matter, the source said.
   Thomas Guidoboni, a lawyer for the Washington, D.C., firm of
Bonner & O'Connell, said he had been retained to represent Morris
``in the so-called computer virus matter.''
   ``We have notified the federal authorities of our representation
and his whereabouts,'' the lawyer said. ``We are in the process of
investigating the facts and circumstances which have been reported
by the press in order to determine our course of action.''
   Morris' father, Robert T. Morris Sr., chief scientist at the
National Computer Security Center in Bethesda, Md., has refused to
say if his son created the virus. He said his son left the Ithaca,
N.Y., campus last week to avoid reporters and is staying at the
family's Arnold, Md., home.
   A team of technicians at Cornell spent the weekend searching the
computer tapes and accounts trying to track the source.
   Morris' friends have said he created the virus as an intellectual
challenge and that it was supposed to lie dormant in computer
systems, according to several news accounts of the incursion.
   Morris reportedly went to dinner after setting the program loose
Wednesday night and checked it before going to bed. Discovering his
mistake, Morris desperately worked to find a way to stop the virus'
spread.
   He called Harvard's Aiken Computation Lab early Thursday after
realizing there was an error in the program he had intended to be
harmless, said ndrew H. Sudduth, a programmer at the lab. Morris did
his undergraduate studies at Harvard.
   ``He was extremely shocked and tired,'' Sudduth told The Harvard
Crimson in a story published Monday. ``His tone was very sober.''
   Computer security consultants said they had received far more
inquiries than usual since last week. However, they said computer
security troubles cannot be solved with passwords and installing
anti-viral software.
   Jon David, a computer security consultant in Tappan, N.Y., said
businesses that had contacted him for help seemed to underestimate
the challenge.
   ``The amazing thing is, the attitude I'm getting is, `Why don't
you stop by for a day or two and tell us how to protect ourselves
from viruses?''' he said.
