<HEAD>First Lady: Trauma of Shooting Led to Astrologer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First Lady Nancy Reagan said Monday she
consulted an astrologer on President Reagan's travel schedule
because she was ``obsessed with his safety'' after he was shot in
March 1981.
   It was ``a terrible trauma'' when her husband was shot, ``and
you're in shock much longer than you know you're in shock,'' Mrs.
Reagan said in a CBS News interview. ``And you reach out anywhere
for, for comfort.''
   Mrs. Reagan was first reported to have consulted an astrologer
on her husband's schedule in a book by former White House Chief of
Staff Donald Regan. The White House later confirmed it.
   Interviewed during CBS' coverage of the Republican National
Convention, Mrs. Reagan told anchorman Dan Rather that some months
after the attack on her husband she heard about a woman who had
said she would have warned against his public appearance that day.
   ``And I said, `Oh, gee, did she really?' And I was so obsessed
with his safety, that anytime he went out of the house, I think my
heart stopped,'' Mrs. Reagan said. ``So all I would do would, would
be to ask her, `Is, is this a, would he be all right? Is it better
for him to go to Chicago on Wednesday or Tuesday?'''

   John H. Sweet, a retired president, board
chairman and chief executive officer of U.S. News & World Report,
died Sunday of cardiopulmonary arrest at a nursing home in this
Washington suburb. He was 81.
   Sweet came to Washington in 1946 and joined the old World Report
magazine as its circulation manager. Two years later, when World
Report merged with U.S. News, he became circulation director of the
new publication.
   Sweet later headed the advertising and the research and
promotion departments before becoming executive vice president and
publisher in 1951.
   He was named president of the magazine in 1958 and was promoted
to board chairman and chief executive officer in 1973. He stepped
down as CEO in 1981 and as board chairman the following year.
   During his years with the magazine, it grew from a circulation
of 250,000 and revenue of $3.4 million to a circulation of more
than 2 million and advertising revenue of more than $70 million a
year.
   Survivors include his wife, Anne; one son, Anthony H. Sweet of
Los Altos, Calif.; and one daughter, Elizabeth Ternes of Virginia
Beach, Va.

   President Reagan was in the midst of his
speech to the Republican National Convention Monday night when a
balloon popped.
   ``Missed me,'' he said quickly and went on without a pause.
That's become one of his favorite retorts to such sounds.
   A few moments later, in a series of statements that he began
with ``facts are stubborn things,'' Reagan misspoke.
   ``Facts are stupid things,'' he said and, just as quickly as
before, corrected himself to say ``facts are stubborn things.''

   Worshipers screamed and lifted their hands
toward the sky as a ray of light burst through the clouds Monday
evening during an outdoor Mass where thousands came expecting a
miracle.
   Shortly after the 6 p.m. Mass began at St. John Neumann Catholic
Church, throngs of pilgrims stood and applauded as many spectators
pointed skyward, crying that they saw Jesus and the Virgin Mary and
calling it a miracle.
   ``I saw the sun pulsating a lot and saw Jesus about 10 times,''
said Mamie Fertitta. ``Then I saw Jesus above and the doves below.''
   A dozen priests standing on a rooftop altar and 600 Eucharist
ministers turned their backs to the crowd to look at the sky and
wave. After minutes of silence, St. John Neumann pastor Monsignor
Joseph James began to sing ``Amazing Grace.''
   People in the audience whipped out cameras to photograph the
clouds and light.
   ``I saw baby Jesus for an instant in the sky,'' said Koreth
Vargahese of Houston.
   The Texas National Guard estimated the crowd for the service at
about 12,000 people.
   To some in the crowd the shape they saw in the sky was the
miracle they had been hoping for. Their shouts alerted others. Some
then reported seeing the same apparation and others did not.
   ``I'm positive other people saw things and they took
photographs,'' said Father Albert Meyer, a Benedictine monk from
Pecos, New Mexico.
   ``I didn't see anything, but some of the other priests on the
altar did,'' Joe Richard, a deacon of the Lubbock parish.
   Monday was the Catholic feast of the ascension of the Virgin
Mary into heaven. The crowds were drawn to the charismatic parish
in West Texas by national attention given to three parishioners'
reports that they received messages from the Virgin Mary this
spring, including tidings of miracles on the feast day.
   Earlier Monday, parish members and priests laid hands on the
pilgrims and said prayers for the scores of handicapped people
present.
   Hundreds of people in wheelchairs and walkers settled on the
grassy hillside beneath a 60-foot-long altar built atop the church
office.
   ``I heard that Mary's crown was spinning on the statue inside
the church last night, so I believe anything can happen,'' said
Marilyn Oliver as she stepped off a bus with 43 other Catholics
from East Texas.
   Parish officials did not confirm the rumor about the crown.
   James said he did not know whether attendance would reach the
20,000 people he said Mary told him would come. ``It doesn't matter
how many are here. Some beautiful spirtual things are going on.''
   The reported messages at the church came after James and several
parishioners returned from Medugorje, Yugoslavia, where six youths
claimed they began seeing apparitions of Mary in 1981 and two say
they still see them daily.
   One group skeptical of the reports said the trip and the
beginning of the messages was too coincidental to be believable.
   ``While we are certainly open to any verifiable paranormal
events, so far the only amazing thing that has happened here is the
fact that thousands of people would flock here from all over,
against common sense, on the unverified claims of one man,'' said
Harvey Madison, spokesman for West Texans to Promote Rational
Thought, a group that investigates claims of paranormal behavior.
   The three parishioners say Mary and God speak to them during
Monday night recitations of the rosary. The trio write the
``messages'' in notebooks and read them aloud after the service.
   ``I feel her love, her joy, her sorrow and that's what I write
down,'' said one of the three, Mary Constancion, a former hospital
therapist who quit her job to devote more time to prayer and church
work.

<TEXT>
   More than 75 Israeli troops
broke into Yakub Zeitoon's home one recent morning, stayed about a
half hour and took two cars, two television sets, a stereo, a
vacuum cleaner and an electric drill.
   Zeitoon was the target of a ``tax sweep,'' the latest method
used by Israel's military government in the occupied territories to
crack down on Palestinians who refuse to pay taxes.
   The eight-month-old Palestinian rebellion has largely moved from
daily violent protests to a determined battle of wits and wills,
with Arabs striving for independence and Israel seeking to maintain
its administrative hold on the territories.
   That struggle for control is epitomized in the tax war.
   For the moment, the Palestinians appear to be winning.
   Israeli roundups of cars and electronics have had limited
success in convincing Palestinians to pay personal or sales taxes.
Israeli officials acknowledge about a 50 percent drop in tax
collection in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Zeitoon himself still
refuses to pay.
   In addition, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel has
filed a complaint with the army, arguing that some methods used to
try to convince Palestinians to pay taxes, such as confiscating
identity cards, are illegal.
   Army officials deny the charges of illegality and say the
Palestinians will suffer in the long run for their protest.
   ``We are going to have to cut services'' to the occupied lands,
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin told Parliament this month.
   For their part, Palestinians contend that in 20 years of Israeli
occupation, they have never gotten back in services as much as they
paid in cash to Israel.
   ``For 20 years we lived like chickens, laying eggs that the
Israelis took,'' Zeitoon said in an interview. ``We're tired of
being treated like animals. Now we want our pride.''
   The Palestinians' contention is supported by Israeli researcher
Meron Benvenisti, who publishes annual studies of the occupied
territories funded by the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations.
   Israel collected $80 million in direct and indirect taxes from
the West Bank and Gaza in 1987 and returned $30 million to the
occupied lands and southern Lebanon, keeping $50 million for
Israeli coffers, Benvenisti told The Associated Press.
   The tax war has intensified since King Hussein of Jordan began
cutting ties with the West Bank, which he lost to Israel in the
1967 Middle East war.
   Hussein stopped salaries for 21,000 Palestinians and abandoned a
five-year, $1.3 billion development plan, leaving an administrative
void.
   But even as early as January, underground leaders of the
Palestinian uprising called on Arabs to stop paying taxes to
Israel, and many complied.
   Palestinians who paid taxes often were identified by graffitti
scrawled on neighborhood walls or on Arab radio broadcasts, and
their shops or homes were sometimes set afire or vandalized.
   In Ramallah, about 70 percent of the 2,000 to 2,500 merchants
have stopped paying taxes, according to Zeitoon, even though many
have lost more in confiscations by the Israelis than they would
have had to pay in taxes.
   Zeitoon said he owes the Israeli military government about
$20,000, but the goods confiscated from him were worth about
$75,000.
   Ahmed Abu Rawan, who owned a stone-cutting factory before the
uprising began in December, said he stopped paying business-related
taxes in January and owes the Israeli military administration about
$750.
   When he refused to pay, they confiscated his $7,500 car, he said.
   But Rawan, 36, has another problem. Since January he has lived
on the run, sleeping in the homes of friends, because he says
soldiers told his wife he would be arrested if they could catch him.
   ``When I know the Israelis have a holiday, I try to sneak home
and see my wife and two children,'' Rawan told the AP in the home
of a relative. ``During the week, I try to meet them at different
places.''
   Rawan's factory has been closed down. He now earns small sums as
a handyman and receives money monthly from a relative in the United
States.
   Rawan thinks the underground leaders called for a ban on tax
payments before they thoroughly thought about how seriously this
would hurt Palestinians.
   But he says he will nevertheless obey the directive.
   ``We will give up what they ask us,'' he said. ``I have
sacrified, yes. But compared to some _ the dead, the imprisoned _
it is little. When I think of them, how can I pay my taxes?''

   In a cramped gondola dangling beneath
an 11-story helium balloon, with clouds obstructing any view below,
the disembodied voice of the radar operator seemed scarcely to be
believed.
   ``You have crossed the coast of Ireland,'' the voice told three
American balloonists on that still-dark early morning 10 years ago.
Larry Newman asked if the message was indeed that which had eluded
others for 105 years.
   Silence.
   Then, crisply, ``Sir, my radar is never wrong.''
   Newman, along with Ben Abruzzo and Maxie Anderson, whooped with
joy. Sunburned and weary after five days aloft, the
businessmen-adventurers had made the first trans-Atlantic crossing
in a balloon.
   The three landed their black-and-silver Double Eagle II later
that day, Aug. 17, 1978, in a wheat field west of Paris.
   Today, Newman is the only one of the three still alive.
   Anderson was killed in 1983 at age 48 when his balloon crashed
in a West German forest during a race. Abruzzo, then 53, died in
1985 when his twin-engine airplane crashed shortly after takeoff in
Albuquerque.
   Newman, now 40 and a commercial airline pilot in Phoenix, Ariz.,
said he has no specific plans to celebrate Wednesday's anniversary.
   But he said his thoughts often drifted back to that summer 10
years ago.
   Newman recalled that after the initial jubilation, Anderson went
to sleep while he and Abruzzo looked down through the clearing
clouds on the lights of Dublin, Ireland.
   The silent 112-foot balloon 15,000 feet up caught sounds that
drifted skyward. Newman and Abruzzo could hear dogs barking and
trains rumbling along tracks nearly 3 miles below.
   ``Tears came to my eyes,'' Newman said. ``I put my arm around
Ben _ he'd always been somewhat like a father to me. I hadn't felt
that close to another human being for as long as I can remember.''
   The men began the flight six days earlier when the Double Eagle
II lifted up from Presque Isle, Maine, and headed toward Europe
more than 3,000 miles away.
   Newman says the flight was not without problems, including a
clash of personalities.
   ``Maxie Anderson later stated that he wished he could have flown
the flight by himself,'' Newman said. ``I don't know what Ben's
feelings were, but I wanted someone to share this with. I didn't
want to be Charles Lindbergh.''
   Newman said conflicts arose when Anderson and Abruzzo both began
making key decisions.
   ``Any aircraft can only have one captain, and we had two: Ben
Abruzzo and Maxie Anderson,'' he said.
   But Newman said conflicts were overshadowed by the hardships of
the flight in the 12-by-6-foot living space crowded with TV cameras
and navigational equipment. Newman's hang glider dangled beneath
the gondola and 5,500 pounds of sand and lead for ballast hung over
the sides in bags.
   ``There were many times the flight was in question,'' Newman
recalled. ``But how close it came to failure at each moment was
interpreted different by each of us.''
   They lost altitude rapidly at one point when ice chunks crusted
the top of the balloon. They jettisoned valuable ballast. When they
dropped to 4,000 feet the ice melted.
   Later in the flight they dumped more ballast, including an
expensive navigation system that had failed on the second day. They
tossed oxygen bottles, anything they could.
   Newman said that at one point, a bit delirious from the
altitude, he chucked a $4,000 radio _ and only later noticed a jar
of peanut butter that weighed as much.
   Plans were for Newman to fly the glider down once they made it
to Paris.
   But 400 miles from Ireland, it came down to a choice of dropping
the glider, their last oxygen and food, or a propane tank for a
heater to battle Abruzzo's frostbite. The glider went.
   Radios also failed during the flight, and the men had to
communicate by ham radio.
   ``The first guy I talked to wouldn't talk because I didn't have
a license,'' said Newman. ``And he didn't believe I was in a
balloon over the middle of the ocean.''
   Finally, Newman reached an old man confined to a wheelchair in a
home for the elderly somewhere in England.
   ``His call sign was `G4JY.' I don't think I'll ever forget
that,'' he said. ``He talked to me until the last day of the
flight. He was like the Good Shepherd.''
   Newman said the rough times were offset by the excitement.
   A high point, he said, came over Ireland when a jumbo jet
relayed a message from the Smithsonian Institution. The museum had
asked to display the gondola and balloon in the National Air and
Space Museum that houses the Apollo 11 moonship, Lindbergh's Spirit
of St. Louis and the Wright brothers' plane.
   In the final few hours the men believed they would make it to
Paris, where Lindbergh had landed 51 years before after the first
solo trans-Atlantic airplane flight. But over Evreux, France, they
realized they could not go on.
   The last of the ballast was gone, save for a bottle of
champagne. They were 60 miles west of Paris, 3,107 miles and 137
hours from Maine where the helium-packed balloon had taken off.
   The swiftly draining balloon envelope carcass and its gondola
settled gently to Earth as cheering spectators abandoned their cars
along a nearby highway and rushed to the balloon.
   Hundreds tried to take a piece of history.
   ``It's hard to chew rubberized cloth,'' Newman said. ``People
were trying to tear little shreds off, but I think they were
probably losing their teeth more than damaging the balloon.''
   The French press dubbed them the ``new Lindberghs.''
   But Newman says the only time he thought about Lindbergh was
when the adventurers drew straws that evening to see which would
sleep in Lindbergh's bed at the American ambassador's residence in
France.
   Newman and his wife won.
   ``And I ended up on the floor after 30 minutes because I
couldn't sleep,'' he said. ``The bed was like a banana. The springs
were shot.''

<HEAD>Israeli Stir Arab Protest With Plans To Open Tunnel Near Sacred
Site</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Israeli officials have stirred Arab protests
with plans to dig an opening that will allow tourists to walk along
the entire western wall of the ancient Jewish Temple, which was
destroyed by the Romans in A.D. 70.
   Caretakers of the Al Aqsa mosque complex, built on the 36-acre
plateau that once held the temple, fear any digging will serve as a
pretext to start excavations under the Islamic holy site.
   Palestinians in Jerusalem's Old City rioted in July, forcing
Israeli workers to halt digging an entrance in a narrow side street
off the Via Dolorosa, where tradition says Jesus carried the cross
to his crucifixion.
   Israeli officials say they will press ahead with the project
once tensions subside.
   The controversy illustrates the deep suspicions and acute
sensitivities that surround the site which is holy to the world's
three major monotheistic religions.
   ``Our desire to open the tunnel is purely cultural and
touristic,'' Dany Bahat, chief archaeologist of Jerusalem, told
reporters during a recent tour.
   Part of the 350-yard tunnel, which follows the temple's western
wall for most of its route, was the main commercial thoroughfare in
the days of King Herod.
   Folded pieces of paper with the prayers of modern Jewish
visitors who walked in the tunnel can been seen in the cracks
between the huge, smooth stones which have remained in place since
Herod rebuilt the temple in the first century B.C. It was first
destroyed by Babylonians in 586 B.C. Herod's second temple lasted
until the Romans sacked it in 70.
   Testifying to the greatness of Islamic architecture are vaulted
chambers built by the Mamelukes in the 13th century to support a
bridge linking the Al Aqsa complex with the city. Al Aqsa was built
in 536.
   The tunnel, excavated after Israel captured the Old City in the
1967 Middle East war, cannot be opened for tourists unless an exit
is built, Bahat said.
   Moslem officials say they do not believe Israeli intentions are
innocent, and underground leaflets call for Palestinians to be on
their guard to prevent attempts to excavate under the Al Aqsa
complex.
   Hassan Tahboub, a member of the Supreme Moslem Council in
Jerusalem, said Moslems feared the tunnel would be used to burrow
under the Al Aqsa complex. In 1981, Israeli militants dug a 25-yard
shaft before Moslem guards stopped them.
   ``The purpose of the (tunnel opening) is political, to make the
supporters of (Israeli) religious parties happy before the (Nov. 1)
elections,'' said Tahboub.
   ``Their ultimate target is to take all of the area.''
   Gershon Salomon, head of a group of militant Jewish nationalists
called the Temple Mount Faithful, agreed that the tunnel was the
front line in a battle for control of the holy site.
   Salomon said if Moslems were able to stop the tunnel they would
try to expand their influence to other areas.
   The group met earlier in August with right-wing Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir to press demands to open the tunnel immediately.
   Shamir spokesman Yossi Achimier said the premier saw Jerusalem
``primarily as a Jewish city'' and supported Jewish rights to the
Old City and the Temple Mount. But he said Shamir's ``first
priority for Jerusalem was calm and coexistence'' and nothing would
be done to stir up the situation.
   Bahat said any further attempts to dig beneath the Al Aqsa would
be unlikely because two shafts leading from the tunnel under the Al
Aqsa complex are blocked by huge stones.
   Bahat defended earlier excavations, saying they helped improve
health standards. He said the underground chambers had been used as
sewers before 1967 and that seepage had leaked into the city's
water supply.
   But Adnan Husseini, chief engineer of the Moslem trust fund that
administers Al Aqsa, said Israeli excavation caused the ground to
shift, resulting in serious damage to modern houses and to Islamic
buildings of the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries.
   ``From the time digging started cracks began to appear in
buildings over the tunnel,'' said Husseini. ``This important
Israeli tunnel comes at the expense of our important Moslem
buildings.''
   To Jews, the Temple Mount is the holiest of all sites, the site
of the temple that held the tablets on which Moses wrote the Ten
Commandments.
   To Moslems, it is the Haram Al Sharif, or Noble Enclosure in
Arabic, where the Prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven to receive
the word of God from the Angel Gabriel. Jerusalem is the holiest
Islamic site after the Saudi Arabian cities of Mecca and Medina.
   To Christians, the temple was the site where Jesus threw out the
money changers. Christian Crusaders based themselves at the temple
as well, converting Al Aqsa into a church for the Knights Templar.

   After years of being scorned as
ineffective and anti-American, the United Nations is making a
comeback as a potent instrument of international peacemaking, an
old idea whose time has come again.
   Blue-helmeted U.N. peacekeeping troops are peering through
binoculars from the beaches of Cyprus to the mountains of
Afghanistan. About 350 soon will monitor a cease-fire in the
Iran-Iraq war, and they are likely to be deployed in southern
Africa and Cambodia under emerging peace pacts.
   The United Nations owes its revitalized role to the superpowers'
improved relations and their interest in redirecting resources from
regional conflict to economic development. If the organization is
on a roll, it is because the superpowers have decided the time has
come to exploit it.
   Recent mediation between Iran and Iraq, leading to a planned
cease-fire Aug. 20 in their 8-year-old war, has been the major
accomplishment of Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar and the
Security Council.
   It followed a U.N.-brokered settlement in April between
Afghanistan and Pakistan, providing for the withdrawal of Soviet
troops from Afghanistan after nearly nine years.
   The Afghan settlement was the culmination of years of patient
diplomacy. When the Soviet leadership decided to cut its losses and
withdraw, the United Nations was there. A force of 50 unarmed U.N.
observers is monitoring the withdrawal, which is to be completed by
Feb. 15.
   ``As rarely before, we can see the organization's potential for
peace, its utility as a trusted good officer,'' Perez de Cuellar
said last week. ``Its peacemaking and peacekeeping can yet bring
hope to those afflicted by endless violence.''
   The momentum is building. A major U.N. role is forseen in
Cyprus, where U.N. troops are separating Greek and Turkish
communities on the divided island, and in Cambodia to end the
Vietnamese occupation.
   U.N. troops are also expected to monitor a troop withdrawal from
Namibia, occupied by South Africa in defiance of U.N. resolutions,
and a transition to independence in the territory.
   For years, massive U.N. work in refugee aid, family planning,
economic and agricultural development, childhood innoculation,
teacher training and other areas was overlooked as the world
focused on the organization's inability to end conflicts. Suddenly,
years of diplomacy seem to be bearing fruit.
   For all the fanfare, the United Nations is desperately short on
funds.
   The Soviet Union, the first of the superpowers to rediscover the
United Nations as a tool of foreign policy, is now paying its back
dues and peacekeeping arrears. Moscow now hails the organization as
a forum for ``new political thinking.''
   The United States, by contrast, is the biggest U.N. debtor. It
has been withholding about $467 million in regular budget payments
over several years and about $70 million in peacekeeping dues.
   For years, the United States denounced the organization as an
intrusion upon its sovereign right to act unilaterally and said it
didn't like leftist U.N. politics. It charged the body with
squandering funds on Third World causes and refused to pay until
reforms were promised.
   Now, Washington praises U.N. accomplishments in Afghanistan and
in the Persian Gulf. But the money is not forthcoming.
   ``Now we face a new irony,'' Perez de Cuellar said. ``At the
very time when the pursuit of peace quickens its pace throughout
the United Nations, bankruptcy threatens to close the
organization.''
   If the United States and other debtor nations do not come up
with funds soon, the organization could close this fall.
   The United Nations, successor to the League of Nations, was
created in 1945 as an organization of peace-loving states repelled
by World War II. Its aim was to maintain peace and security and
work for social progress.
   One of the organization's most enduring problems in the last 40
years has been the search for a resolution of the Arab-Israeli
conflict.
   Each time the region has been threatened by war, the United
Nations has sent impartial observers or peacekeeping forces. It has
launched five peace-keeping operations since Israel was created in
1948, during which time six wars have broken out.
   The first U.N. observer operation in the Middle East was the
U.N. Truce Supervision Organization. Created in the 1948
Arab-Israeli war to supervise a truce, UNTSO has remained to
monitor armistice agreements between Israel and its neighbors.
   Another U.N. success in the region was the creation in 1956 of
its first peacekeeping force, the U.N. Emergency Force, when
Israeli, British and French forces moved into Egypt. The force was
essential in bringing about a cease-fire and the withdrawal of
invading forces.
   U.N. troops sent to Cyprus in 1964 maintained peace before and
after the Turkish invasion of 1974. The U.N. operation in the Congo
from 1960 to 1964 helped restore peace but it was criticized for
partisanship during a provincial secession and the intervention of
Belgian troops.

   Asking about a sexual partner's health or sexual
history is not a reliable means of avoiding AIDS because many
people lie to have sex, a researcher says.
   One-third of sexually experienced male college students and 10
percent of women admitted in a study that they have told a lie of
some sort to get someone to sleep with them, the researcher said.
   ``Asking partners about risk factors is probably not a very good
strategy for reducing the risk of AIDS,'' said Susan Cochran,
associate professor in the psychology department of California
State University at Northridge.
   She described results of her survey Saturday at the annual
meeting of the American Psychological Association.
   Cochran said she began the study after noticing that many women
were asking sex partners about past behavor that carries a risk of
AIDS infection as a way to reassure themselves about having sex
with the man.
   People can get infected with the virus that causes acquired
immune deficiency syndrome by having sex with an infected person or
using an infected needle or contaminated blood products.
   Questioning partners about their drug use and sexual history is
not an effective substitute for taking precautions such as using
condoms, she said.
   The study focused on 422 unmarried, sexually experienced college
students at two Southern California campuses. Ages ranged from 18
to 25 with an average of 19. Forty-six percent were men.
   Thirty-five percent of men admitted to telling a lie to have
sex. In addition, 47 percent of men and 60 percent of women
reported that somebody had lied to them in order to have sex.
   The study did not specify what the respondents had lied about.
   Other questions asked what the person would do if honesty
threatened the chance to have sex or to maintain a desired dating
relationship.
   Asked if they would falsely claim to have taken a blood test to
detect exposure to the AIDS virus, and claim the result was
negative, 20 percent of men and 4 percent of women said yes.
   Forty-seven percent of men and 42 percent of women said they
would report having had fewer sexual partners than they really did.
   Still, 52 percent of the women said they ask sex partners about
sexual and drug histories, and 23 percent ask if partners had taken
an AIDS test.
   ``If you ask somebody if they have risk factors and they say
yes, you can be reasonably assured they're not lying,'' Cochran
said. ``But if they say no, you're not really any further along
than not asking.''
   June Reinisch, director of the Kinsey Institute for Research in
Sex, Gender and Reproduction, said the results make sense.
   ``In the dating situation, you can't believe and act upon
information that comes from the partner,'' she said. ``You have to
take care of yourself.''

   Actor Billy Barty was delighted as he
settled his 3-foot-9 frame into the blue and white chair.
   His feet touched the ground.
   ``How can you put a price on the smile that came across his
face?'' said Michael Buzzella, vice president of Sunburst Outdoor
Furniture, which is beginning production on one of the first
specially designed lines for dwarfs, midgets and other adults of
small stature.
   ``To be able to sit in a chair with your feet touching the
ground is something average-size people don't even think about,''
Buzzella said. ``For little people, it's an uncommon thrill.''
   Barty, a consultant on the project, said the Sunburst outdoor
furniture designs are among the first of any kind of furniture
produced specifically for ``little people,'' as he terms anyone
afflicted by the nearly 200 different forms of dwarfism.
   ``We are a minority that is really a minority,'' said the
63-year-old actor in a telephone interview from Tulsa, Okla., where
he is filming a movie. ``We are mostly handicapped by physical
barriers we face. Clothes have to be cut down; light switches are
too high.''
   ``I can't tell you how wonderful it felt like to sit in a chair
with your feet on the ground and your back in the proper place,''
added Barty, who has championed the little people's cause since the
late 1950s.
   Sunburst, which supplies outdoor furniture to resorts and hotels
around the world, began thinking small last year with a line of
children's furniture for Florida's Walt Disney World.
   Company founder and president R.W. Buzzella, who had built a
scaled-down bar and stool set for a dwarf couple three years ago,
thought the children's furniture might be adapted for the nation's
1.5 million little people. A letter was sent in March to Barty at
his Foundation For Little People office in North Hollywood, Calif.
   Barty quickly responded and arranged a visit to the Sunburst
production center in Hialeah shortly after the release of
``Willow,'' in which he plays a high priest.
   ``But he immediately showed us that furniture for little people
and children are very different,'' said Michael Buzzella, arranging
three chairs side by side.
   The children's chair was smaller but in the same proportions as
the adult version. The little people's model was modified with a
low seat and elevated armrests to accommodate their shorter limbs
and torsos.
   ``It was a real learning experience for us,'' Buzzella said.
``You just can't put a little person in children's furniture. It
doesn't work and they are not comfortable. They have their own
special dimensions.''
   Sunburst, a division of MetalTech Inc., unveiled the Rainbow
Collection in July at a convention in Des Moines, Iowa, attended by
about 600 little people.
   Buzzella took about 80 furniture orders. Many had special
requests, such as an extra narrow seat for a woman with a rare,
acute form of dwarfism.
   The profit for Sunburst in the venture is also small, he said.
   ``To be candid, a big manufacturer would not touch this
project,'' Buzzella said. ``It's not smart business. It's not a
big-volume-type deal. But this company has been fortunate, and we'd
like to give something back and not just think about the dollars
involved.''
   Sunburst, which had sales of about $5 million last year, scored
a success in 1964 with the patent of an aluminum umbrella designed
to withstand harsh weather and high winds. The umbrellas are used
in most fast-food franchises and many hotels worldwide, Buzzella
said.
   ``I know they're never going to make money on making furniture
for little people,'' Barty said. ``That's what makes it so special.
They have gone beyond money and done something for people who have
become accustomed to being ignored.''

<HEAD>Leaked Memos Derail Councilman's Challenge To Mayor Bradley</HEAD>

   Leaked campaign strategy memos laced with
coarse remarks threaten to ignite racial tensions in the early
stages of a mayoral campaign that pits a Jewish city councilman
against black incumbent Tom Bradley.
   The memos were prepared by a consulting firm associated with
39-year-old City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who is seeking to
become the city's first Jewish mayor and poses by many accounts the
first real challenge to Bradley in a decade. Both are Democrats;
the race is nonpartisan.
   The documents by veteran strategists Michael Berman and Carl
D'Agostino, whose firm is known as BAD Campaigns, berate
Yaroslavsky about his grim demeanor, mock Bradley's intelligence,
refer to environmentalists as ``tree huggers'' and slow-growth
advocates as ``crazed homeowners.''
   The strategists urge Yaroslavsky, who represents a chunk of the
city's largely affluent and liberal west side, to skip City Council
meetings and focus his energies on fund-raising efforts among
Jewish contributors.
   ``What we do know is that Jewish wealth in Los Angeles is
endless,'' said one of the memos, which were leaked anonymously.
   Elsewhere, the advisers wrote: ``The reason why BAD thinks you
can beat Bradley is: You've got 50 IQ points on him (and that's no
compliment).''
   Berman and D'Agostino, after the memos' release last week,
announced their ``regrets that our private, irreverent attempts at
humor might have caused embarrassment or offense.''
   Yaroslavsky quickly divorced himself from the consultants,
saying, ``I do not agree with many of their ideas and I find many
of their statements to be insulting, insensitive and not reflective
of my views.''
   Mark Ridley-Thomas, executive director of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference of Greater Los Angeles, said the memos'
contents ``come perilously close to being blatant racist remarks.''
   ``At the absolute minimum they're highly insensitive,'' he said.
   He said the memos threaten to inflame black resentment over a
perceived lack of Jewish support during Bradley's failed 1986
campaign for governor, and over tensions that emerged between Jews
and blacks during Jesse Jackson's Democratic presidential bid
earlier this year.
   The mayor, who at age 70 is seeking an unprecedented fifth term
as mayor of the nation's second-largest city, denounced the memos
as unprincipled and potentially racially divisive.
   ``Talking about the relative intelligence of candidates is of no
consequence,'' Bradley said. ``I think I've demonstrated over the
years my intelligence and my ability to handle the public's
problems.''
   Bradley has become politically vulnerable because of his
protracted tenure of 16 years and position on environmental issues.
He has switched from opposition to approval of a proposed onshore
drilling project near Pacific Palisades, an exclusive canyon
enclave overlooking the Pacific.
   Despite its name, BAD Campaigns is a highly regarded firm.
``D'Agostino and Berman are extremely well-respected as very
capable and talented and winning consultants,'' said former
Republican U.S. Rep. Bobbi Fiedler.
   Berman said Bradley found his advice amusing when Berman
submitted similar pointed comments during Bradley's unsuccessful
1969 mayoral campaign and in 1973, when he was elected the first
black mayor of a major U.S. city.
   ``When it's excerpted, it becomes a bit embarrassing,'' Berman
said of the memos. ``We don't mean to offend anybody. We had no
intention of offending the mayor on the IQ.''
   Fiedler, summing up the controversy, said, ``I think what's
happened is that the voters have been given a glimpse into what
politics is really like.''
   Political consultants in general ``tend to see themselves as the
movers and shakers and the candidate as the vehicle,'' she said.
``So they often will seem somewhat arrogant and paternal to this
woeful candidate.''

   In his northern Philippine stronghold,
Ferdinand Marcos remains a pervasive, respected figure more than
two years after a Manila-based uprising toppled his 20-year
authoritarian regime.
   ``I tell you that if he ran again, he would win hands down
here,'' said Rafael Benemerito, mayor of the town of Pagudpud in
the province of Ilocos Norte, where Marcos was born in 1917. ``You
know, we Ilocanos are very clannish.''
   In most of the Philippines, the Marcos years are associated with
massive corruption, economic mismanagement and oppression.
President Corazon Aquino has refused to allow Marcos to return from
Hawaii, where he fled after the February 1986 uprising that
propelled her to power.
   But in his native province, Marcos still enjoys widespread
respect among his fellow Ilocanos.
   Marcos rewarded the province, which has a population of about
440,000, with roads and development projects. Ilocanos are strongly
represented within the armed forces, although precise figures are
not available.
   Rep. Roque Ablan, a pro-Marcos congressman, says allegations of
massive corruption and embezzlement of up to $10 billion have not
significantly dented support for the ousted leader.
   ``In spite of all the accusations and charges, we still look up
to Mr. Marcos,'' Ablan said. ``We would like to see him come home,
which is the right of every Filipino.''
   The spirit of Marcos looms over this province, about 250 miles
north of Manila. Rural bus stops and walls of buildings in Laoag,
the provincial capital, still bear graffiti such as ``No To Cory''
or ``Marcos Once More,'' his slogan in the fraud-tainted 1986
election.
   Most provincial and municipal officials elected in regional
balloting in January are members of or have been aligned with
Marcos' New Society Movement party, which has virtually
disintegrated elsewhere in the country.
   In the town hall of Batac, the Marcos family ancestral home,
pictures of Marcos and his wife, Imelda, hang on the walls of the
Bureau of Internal Revenue office. There is no picture of Mrs.
Aquino.
   ``People here still respect Mr. Marcos,'' said the Rev. Ruben
Abaya, a Roman Catholic priest in Batac. ``They would like to see
him come home, although not necessarily as president. They respect
him for his intelligence.''
   Pro-Marcos politicians insist they are no longer anxious for
Marcos to return as president but as a private citizen. Marcos
claimed he won the 1986 election against Mrs. Aquino and left
Manila only after having himself sworn into office.
   Marcos loyalists were linked to at least three major attempts to
topple the Aquino government.
   ``In all our conversations with Mr. Marcos, he always told us to
cooperate with the Aquino government and join hands to fight the
communists,'' Ablan said.
   But not every Ilocano is a dedicated Marcos loyalist. Communist
rebels have made strong inroads in Ilocos Norte since 1981, and by
military estimates there may be as many as 500 Ilocanos in the
communist New People's Army.
   Pro-Marcos sympathies were whipped up three months ago when
supporters of the former president spread reports he would come
home for the funeral of his mother, Josefa, who died May 4.
   Mrs. Aquino refused to allow him to return, and the mother is
still unburied. Still, rumors persist that Marcos will return soon.
   The province's association with Marcos has not been a handicap
under the new administration. Provincial Gov. Rodolfo Farinas said
the Aquino government has not discriminated against Ilocos Norte in
the allocation of state funds.
   But the Laoag International Airport, which once received charter
flights from Hawaii, Taiwan and Hong Kong, has been closed to
foreign traffic since September 1986 to prevent Marcos from
slipping into the counry.
   Airport manager Numeriano Ramones said only three flights a week
come in from Manila. Security guards doze on the tables next to
X-ray machines, and goats, cattle and stray dogs wander over the
tarmac.
   Residents of a nearby village have erected a makeshift
basketball court at the southeastern end of the tarmac.
   The closing of the Laoag airport to international traffic has
severely curtailed business at Fort Ilocandia, a 196-room resort
built to host the wedding reception of Marcos' daughter Irene.
   It was hoped the resort and its casino would attract high
rollers from Hong Kong and Filipino immigrant families from the
United States wishing to vacation in their homeland. Last week, the
hotel had only three guests.

   The phone has been ringing off the hook with
calls from ordinary citizens at the Embezzlement and Bribery
Reporting Center ever since it opened in the east district of
Beijing.
   The office is a sign of the times in China, as the government
tries to control corruption all over the country.
   ``The response of the people has been excellent,'' said a
frazzled Wu Yuhua, the 35-year-old station head, a week after the
center opened July 29. ``They are very curious and have many
complaints.''
   Housed in a cramped 19th century mud-and-mortar dwelling, capped
with the traditional sweeping eaves of a Chinese home, the center
is in a Beijing alley, next to a butcher shop.
   ``We wanted the people to be at home,'' Wu said. ``If we stuck
it on the fifth floor of a government building, no one would come
see us.''
   The station is manned six days a week for eight hours a day and
is equipped with a telephone answering service for after-hours
calls.
   In all, the station is responsible for about 6,000 government
employees serving 1.5 million people.
   All reports are taken in secret to protect the callers and all
investigations are handled by the reporting station.
   ``Too much corruption is investigated in China by the corrupt
bureau itself,'' said Wan Songching, the 50-year-old director of
the east district's investigative wing. ``But this reporting
station will do its own work. We are eager to see results.''
   Similar corruption reporting centers are opening all over the
country and the government says that by September every province
will one. In addition, a telephone corruption hotline opened in
Beijing in early August, ready to take calls from across the nation.
   Wu said such devices are necessary if China is going to reform
its government.
   ``In the past the government always policed itself,'' he
explained. ``Now we've got to have the support of the masses. We
can't clean up the government alone.''
   China has always tolerated a certain level of official
dishonesty. ``Guanxi,'' or connections, are the grease upon which
the wheels of society run. But lately corruption has been getting
out of hand.
   ``I am shocked at the change in my country,'' said Wang Poming,
who returned in July after eight years in the United States.
``Corruption is everywhere. School teachers force their students to
buy breakfast from them to make more money. Students steal tests
and sell them for a profit.''
   ``Corruption and inflation, that's all we Chinese are talking
about,'' said Liu Yuanshang, a bookstore owner in Beijing. ``We are
worried that all the dirt will stop the reforms.''
   The reforms, pushed for the last decade by national leader Deng
Xiaoping, have helped to double China's gross national product in
five years to $295 billion in 1987.
   But, by creating a two-track pricing system of low state-set
prices and higher free market prices, the reforms have created vast
opportunities for illegal deals.
   In late July, 75 state-run businesses in the industrial city of
Wuhan were exposed for making illegal profits off peasants. The
firms bought state goods at fixed low prices and sold them to
farmers at large profits.
   The reselling scheme has become so bad in the cigarette and
liquor market that on July 28 the government raised the price of
China's best brands by as much as 790 percent.
   The official press said the move was made to crush a black
market that has gained a monopoly on high-quality cigarettes and
spirit sales.
   In battling corruption, the government's policies have been
unclear _ lax in one city, harsh in the next and creative somewhere
else.
   In Shenyang, a northern city, the city government recently
imposed a tax on banquets, cars and firecrackers, three items that
officials often use public funds to buy.
   In Beijing, Qiao Yonghang, 35, who had been working for several
years at the state-owned Beijing Communications and Electrical Co.,
was executed July 25 for taking bribes in exchange for color
television sets, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
   In all, he received bribes worth 120,000 yuan ($32,400), which
amounts to 125 years of the average urban salary.
   Still, because of ``guanxi,'' a great percentage of official
corruption continues.
   China's leading paper, the People's Daily (Renmin Ribao),
recently told of Gu Chengju, a forestry official in Hunan province
who stole 300,000 yuan ($81,000) in state funds to build an office
building and a high-class guest house.
   Almost two years after his case was exposed, Gu has yet to be
brought to justice.
   The reason is that Gu has been greasing the hands of local
officials who were supposed to investigate him, the paper said.
   ``This feudalistic practice of officials shielding one another
must end,'' it said in a strong editorial.
   Some Western analysts, notably Tony Kane, a China expert with
the Asia Society in New York, view the growing corruption as a sign
that China is becoming more democratic.
   ``During the Cultural Revolution the dirt and sleaze was just as
widespread but it was being perpetrated by only a few
individuals,'' Kane said. ``Now, at least, you have a situation
where more people are being allowed to participate. That is not
necessarily bad.''
   Wu Yuhuan and his colleagues at the Embezzlement and Bribery
Reporting Station in east Beijing do not agree.
   ``When a rat crosses the street the people run to beat it,'' Wu
said, citing a popular proverb. ``To me, corruption is the rat and
I must kill it.''

<HEAD>Delegates Let Good Times Roll in Party City of New Orleans</HEAD>

   Republicans paid $100 a piece for Sunday
night snacks with a zoo elephant as their rollicking pre-convention
weekend wound down.
   The Very Important Pachyderm at the ``Elephant Romp Welcome'' at
Audubon Zoo was Ellie Mae, who drew adoring attention from the herd
of 3,600 partiers. ``It's a wonderful elephant, obviously
Republican,'' said Joan Milke Flores, a California delegate and Los
Angeles city councilwoman.
   Ellie Mae's handler, James Holston, said the 1,200-pound
elephant was named the convention's official mascot, and had a full
schedule of national television appearances for the entire week.
   New Orleans city councilman Mike Early, who took credit for the
zoo party idea, said the goal was to stuff a 3-week New Orleans
experience into three hours.
   ``A philosophy of this party, I think, would be that in New
Orleans, we believe that throwing a party, hosting a party, really
is an art. It really is a science,'' said Early, a Democrat.
   New Orleans chef Paul Prudhomme stirred chicken etoufee under
one of four air-conditioned zoo tents, and Pat O'Brien's, which
claims to dispense more alcohol than any bar in the world, prepared
2,000 potent Hurricanes in 15-ounce paper cups. ``This is the
official drink, and we want the GOP to try it,'' said O'Brien's
spokesman Lou Reynolds.
   Sunday was filled with dancing and Dixieland from the French
Quarter to private homes in the fashionable Garden District.
   Jazz musicians had plenty of work. At the Sheraton Hotel, a
three-piece group entertained incoming guests, while another combo
imparted Dixieland flavor to a congressional brunch.
   Across the street at the Marriott, Alaska sponsored a
$20,000-plus feast featuring 1,000 pounds of seafood flown in for
the occasion, and exotic treats like moose and reindeer sausage.
   Seafood flown into a city known for its seafood?
   ``That's your kind of seafood, not necessarily our kind,'' said
Jim Crawford, the Alaska GOP chairman. ``But I don't think there's
a better party town in the United States than New Orleans.''
   Some delegates got a head start on the festivities Saturday
night with a rollicking river boat race, Mardi Gras-style parade
and samplings of turtle soup au sherry.
   At the New Orleans' Convention Center, delegates tasted the
city's finest cooking and danced behind a fast-marching city high
school band and miniature Mardi Gras floats. The floats carried
costumed party-goers who pitched plastic beads and doubloons
touting the carnival's sponsor, The Times-Picayune newspaper.
   Al Bullock, an alternate delegate from Maryland who has attended
three conventions, scoffed at decorum and danced in the parade.
``This is the greatest party ever,'' said Bullock, swaying in a
navy blazer and purple beads.
   White-uniformed servers from Commander's Palace ladled 138
gallons of turtle soup au sherry into white styrofoam bowls. At the
105-year-old restaurant, an appetizer portion runs $4.50. On a
night of freebies, there were very few leftovers.
   ``The food's a big hit, and so's the parade,'' said Mark Moses,
a Copeland's supervisor. ``One nice thing about New Orleans. It
opens you up and brings you back to a childhood state. Folks start
out saying about the dancing that it's really stupid. But five

   Jefferson Parish Sheriff Harry Lee, a Democrat, watched the
Republicans eat, drink and dance, then said with laughter, ``We'll
party with them now, and then we'll slug it out this November.''

   A championship tennis match
between Chris Evert and Gabriela Sabatini was marred when someone
threw a glass container of yellow paint onto the court.
   The container shattered about 15 feet from Sabatini, who was
down double match point at 15-40 at Sunday's $300,000 Virginia
Slims contest.
   After a 15-minute delay to clean the court, Sabatini won the
next two points to go to deuce. Sabatini hit a running forehand
into the net, then Evert won the match when the 18-year-old from
Argentina netted a backhand.
   Evert won $60,000 and Sabatini $24,000.
   ``I was scared,'' Sabatini said. ``I think maybe there's crazy
people out there. It was difficult to go out again and play and I
was down two match points.''
   ``This was shocking,'' said Evert. ``I didn't even know what it
was. I was more worried that if they didn't get it up it would get
sticky and the match would be postponed. I just wanted to get it
over with.''
   Tournament promoter Jerry Diamond said police were investigating.

   Having theater stars like Jessica Tandy and
Hume Cronyn as parents wasn't exactly an open invitation to success
on the stage, daughter Tandy Cronyn says.
   ``The first important reviewer to appraise my work gave me a bad
notice,'' Ms. Cronyn said in in intwerview published Sunday in The
Star-Ledger of Newark.
   ``The part had only six lines and I was one of a group, but this
eminent critic of a leading magazine took the trouble to single me
out for a slam. He never would have noticed me except for my name.
And I didn't choose it either.''
   Ms. Cronyn has advanced beyond that role to play a Jewish girl
in Poland who has survived a concentration camp in an off-Broadway
production of ``A Shayna Maidel'' (A Pretty Girl).
   ``I thought, `How can a WASP like me succeed as that Polish
girl?''' Ms. Tandy said. ``But then I was so taken with the play, I
started acting it in my mind and said, `Why not.'''

   Gene Simmons' life and work are based on rock
and shock.
   Fifteen years ago he started the heavy metal group KISS, which
became known as much for its wild makeup and antics as its music.
   Now, he's managing Liza Minnelli's recording career and has
started his own record label.
   ``My life is based on shock. I find the idea so interesting,''
Simmons said recently. ``All of that has a lot in common with my
working with Liza Minnelli. Great work should shock you.''
   Simmons recently took on the role of manager for Miss Minnelli,
whose album on Epic is due out this year.
   KISS, which has released 23 albums, is beginning the European
version of the ``Monsters of Rock'' tour. Simmons said KISS will be
joining such rock heavies as David Lee Roth, Guns and Roses and
Halloween.
   Simmons turned down a role in the new James Bond film, ``License
Revoked,'' with Timothy Dalton, to go on the tour.
   At the same time, the 36-year-old entertainer is busy working
with his newly formed record label, Simmons Records, which is
distributed by MCA. He said he founded the company because he has a
good ear for picking new acts and got tired of others telling him
his discoveries couldn't cut it.
   ``I'll never listen to anyone else again,'' he said. ``Maybe I
know something they don't.''
   In September, House of Lords will become the first group to
release an album on the label.
   He is also expecting his first child with girlfriend Shannon
Tweed, a former Playmate of the Year. He said he feels ``numb''
about the whole thing.
   KISS will release a greatest hits album called ``Smashes
Thrashes and Hits,'' by next summer. The album will include two new
songs, ``Let's put the X in Sex'' and ``Rock Hard.''
   ``Rock 'n' roll should be sexy and fun _ with a strong
backbeat,'' he said.

   In a unique, farewell political role,
President Reagan is taking the offensive as he campaigns for George
Bush's Republican ticket.
   Reagan is center stage tonight for the address that will be the
true keynote of the Republican National Convention. It also will be
his grand finale, at his fourth convention as a dominant GOP figure.
   But it's only the start of his planned campaign. No modern
president has conducted a parting campaign to match the one Reagan
has promised Bush and the Republicans. He expects to appear at
least twice a week in behalf of the ticket and Republican
fund-raising efforts from Labor Day to Election Day.
   Reagan's tone so far has been tough, sometimes contrasting with
the reassuring style that became typical of his personal
campaigning over the past dozen years.
   Not since Dwight D. Eisenhower has a departing president been in
a position to campaign for his party's nominee to succeed to the
office. Eisenhower served two full terms, and left office as a
popular figure. But Vice President Richard M. Nixon, the Republican
nominee in 1960, did not seek extensive campaigning from Eisenhower.
   Popularity is not transferable, of course. And there can be a
down side for a vice president who relies heavily on the campaign
favors of the president to whom he has been understudy. The vice
president has to make his own imprint on the minds of voters, and
he has a relatively brief time to do it.
   Bush and his managers believe they can make the breakthrough
beginning in New Orleans, aided, not inhibited, by an active Reagan
campaign.
   ``He'll be a great surrogate,'' said campaign manager Lee
Atwater. He said Reagan will be especially helpful to the Bush
ticket in Sun Belt states and in California.
   Furthermore, Reagan may be able to help turn on and turn out
conservatives, who never have counted the vice president as one of
their heroes.
   Bush and Reagan have carefully designed roles in New Orleans, so
that the departing president won't overshadow the arriving nominee.
The twain will meet once, on Tuesday, as Bush arrives for the
convention and Reagan leaves New Orleans for a vacation at his
ranch near Santa Barbara, Calif.
   From that point, Bush is supposed to have the starring role.
   The tandem campaign began in the buildup to the convention, in
Washington. Reagan and Bush spoke to the administration's political
appointees, the president telling them that the voters won't gamble
the future on ``a blind date'' with the Democrats. In his weekly
radio address on Saturday, the president said the Democrats are all
talk, while ``we deliver.''
   Then, in a New Orleans arrival preview of his convention
address, Reagan hammered the Democrats, with periodic plugs for
Bush. He denounced the ``narrow agenda of the liberal elites and
special interest groups,'' said the Democrats don't want the voters
to find out what they intend to do and called their Atlanta
convention the biggest masquerade since Mardi Gras.
   In all of that, he pressed a theme designed by the Bush
campaign, the argument that Democrats are hiding from specifics and
from comparison of their offerings with those of the Republicans.
   ``The stealth candidacy has to come out from under cover,'' said
Reagan. ``It's time to talk issues, to use the dreaded `L' word, to
say the policies of our opposition are liberal, liberal, liberal.''
   That `L' word is going to echo through the Superdome convention
hall all week long. It is part of an attack strategy campaign the
Republicans intend to make central to their campaign.

   More than 1,200 Salvadoran refugees
returned from Honduras to their homeland Sunday after being delayed
at the border in a dispute over U.S. church people accompanying
them, a radio report said.
   Roberto Rodriguez of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
said by telephone that the refugees and more than 150 vehicles were
allowed to enter El Salvador at 5:30 p.m. (7:30 p.m. EDT) after the
15 church workers agreed to stay in Honduras.
   Salvadoran government officials say many refugees sympathize
with leftist guerrillas, and have accused church workers of similar
leanings.
   Rodriguez said the refugees were on their way to hometowns in
northern Chalatenango province.
   There was no immediate comment from the Salvadoran government.
Members of the U.S. church organization that had aided the refugees
could not be reached for comment.
   Late Saturday, the convoy of 36 buses and 116 trucks carrying
the refugees and their belongings were halted in Honduras about 500
yards from the border.
   They had left the Mesa Grande refugee camp 30 miles to the north
under an accord worked out among the refugees, the Salvadoran
government and the U.N. organization, which is overseeing the
repatriation.
   Some of the Salvadorans spent up to eight years in the Mesa
Grande camp.
   Jose Maria Mendiluce, the U.N. agency's Central American
director, said the presence of the U.S. church workers _ members of
the Going Home organization _ was not contemplated in the accord.
   Earlier Sunday, Interior Minister Edgar Belloso Funes told
reporters at the border that his government ``welcomes with open
arms'' the Salvadoran refugees.
   ``But the so-called internationalists among them are using our
brothers for strictly political ends. They (the foreigners) are
coming here to break our laws, and I have orders from the highest
level that they not be permitted entry,'' he said.
   Amadeo Lopez, a returning refugee, had said the group was
insisting the U.S. church workers be allowed to enter. He said the
refugees were determined to wait in their mile-long convoy until
their demand was met.
   But the 1,230 refugees, including hundreds of infants and
children, had little food and appeared unprepared to spend days
waiting on the road. Two pregnant women among the refugees were
expected to give birth in coming days.
   Louis Vitale, a Roman Catholic priest from Oakland, Calif., and
spokesman for the Going Home delegation, blamed the Salvadoran
government for the dispute.
   ``This is part of the Salvadoran government's continuing efforts
to obstruct the refugees' return,'' he said, adding that all
members of his delegation had visas for El Salvador.
   Going Home is an interfaith organization supporting Salvadoran
refugees. It participated last October in the first big
repatriation of Salvadoran refugees from Honduras.
   The return of refugees is a highly charged issue in this small
Central American country torn by nearly nine years of civil war.
   The armed forces consider the three Salvadoran refugee camps in
Honduras part of the rear guard of leftist guerrillas fighting the
U.S.-supported government. About 4,300 refugees returned last year
and about 15,000 Salvadoran refugees remain in the camps.
   The Salvadoran government is concerned about their political
sympathies and the burden they may place on an economy devastated
by war, and so it is reluctant to collaborate with that project.
   But a regional peace accord signed last August underscored the
right of refugees to return home, and the government eventually
cooperated with the return.
   ``The terrorists use Mesa Grande as a refuge, to recover from
wounds and to rest. The people there generally sympathize with the
subversives. Their return could be detrimental to us militarily,''
army Col. Ciro Lopez Roque told The Associated Press at the border
Saturday. He is commander of the 4th Brigade in charge of the
northern frontier province of Chalatenango.
   But he also said that ``as a Salvadoran, I recognize that every
Salvadoran has a right to be in his country, and should be here.''
   The refugees intend to return to three towns in Chalatenango
from which they fled in the early 1980s.
   Sofia Enriquez, who left her town of Los Ranchos in 1982, stood
beside a bus and held her infant daughter while another daughter
clutched her skirt. Both girls were born in Mesa Grande.
   Asked why she left, she said: ``We were persecuted. They were
killing people just for the fun of it.''
   Most of the 65,000 people killed in the war have been civilians.
   Human rights groups blame security forces and rightist death
squads for most of the tens of thousands of political murders in
the early 1980s. Such killings dropped off dramatically after 1983.
   Ms. Enriquez, 25, said she hoped for a better life in her own
country. But asked how she planned to manage as a single mother
with two children, no home and no job, she said: ``Who knows.''

<HEAD>GOP Delegates Identify Bush Shortcomings As Well As Strengths</HEAD>

   The Republicans who are about to nominate
George Bush for president see some 200 shortcomings in the
candidate.
   They say he's too liberal or too conservative, too nice or too
honest, too rich or too loyal. A few uttered the word ``wimp'' but
others defended Bush against such a label.
   ``He's a lousy campaigner,'' carped James Proctor, a North
Carolina lawyer whose favorite candidate, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas,
lost out to Bush in the race for the nomination.
   ``He hasn't been elected to a major office for quite a few
years, and I'm a little worried about that, I guess,'' Gene
Warkenthien of South Dakota said of the man who was elected vice
president in 1980 and 1984.
   Proctor and Warkenthien were among 1,215 delegates to the
Republican National Convention who responded to an Associated Press
survey. In all, 2,277 delegates will attend the convention which
opens today in New Orleans.
   When asked to identify Bush's major strengths and weaknesses,
delegates' responses fell into 228 categories on his weaknesses and
127 on his strengths.
   Sixty-three percent of the delegates said Bush's experience in
government, especially his work in foreign policy, would be his
greatest asset in the fall election.
   ``In all the years that I have been attending national
conventions, there has not been a single aspirant who has the
congressional, executive and leadership experience'' of Bush, said
George Hering of Delaware, who has been attending conventions since
1964.
   In addition to serving as vice president, Bush has been director
of the CIA, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, a member of
Congress, and U.S. envoy to China.
   Bush's biggest problem, according to those who are about to
nominate him for president, is his image and speaking style. Nearly
32 percent of the delegates cited these as the obstacles he needs
to overcome in his race for the White House.
   Many said Bush had been unfairly labeled as a ``wimp'' and
blamed the news media for pinning that on him.
   ``He is perceived as being weak _ the wimp factor _ a Charlie
Brown character,'' said Edwin J. Guillot Jr., a delegate from
Puerto Rico. ``It isn't weakness, it's decency, integrity, but
people see it as weakness and it could cost him the election.''
   Pennsylvania delegate Charles Sexton was direct: ``They don't
put wimps in as head of the CIA.''
   The delegates see being vice president as both a blessing and a
curse, allowing Bush to be a part of the Reagan administration's
successes but also forcing him to take the heat for its failures
while keeping his opinions to himself.
   ``He's the vice president, which is a weak office. Someone said
it ain't worth a cup of warm spit and he has proven how true that
is,'' said Howard Clement, a delegate from North Carolina.
   ``He will end up apologizing for Reagan on civil rights issues,
ethics issues, economic issues,'' Clement said. ``He's got a lot of
baggage.''
   While there was no shortage of criticism, almost all of the
delegates also had nice things to say about their nominee.
   ``When he tells you something, you can believe him,'' said David
O'Steen of North Carolina.
   ``His greatest strength is the fact that he's been part of an
administration that has seen the country come from the brink of
disaster to a very solid, stable situation in about every aspect,''
said Rudy Munro of Missouri.
   ``I don't think he would have been made head of the CIA if he
wasn't intelligent,'' said Marguerite Armstrong of Vermont.
   And finally there was a piece of advice.
   ``If he can appear as the All-American Boy Scout, that'll be his
strength,'' said Arizona delegate Evan Mecham, who was impeached
and removed from office as the state's governor in April.

   David Letterman fans will watch a butter
sculpture of guest Jack Hanna melt, making more of a mess on the
set than most of the Columbus Zoo director's animal friends have
left.
   Hanna has taken many of his animals on NBC-TV's ``Late Night
With David Letterman,'' and they don't always display the best
manners.
   A crew from the Letterman show last weekend searched the Ohio
State Fair for acts, and selected the butter sculpture of Hanna
holding a lion cub. It will deteriorate over a one-week period on
the show, starting tonight.
   The statue was sculpted by Dan Ross of Columbus.
   Last year's statue of race car driver Bobby Rahal was displayed
intact on the Letterman show.
   Letterman producer Robert Morton said this probably is the last
year Lettterman's crew will search the fair, where butter
sculptures have been displayed since the early 1900s and usually
are broken up when the event ends.

   At first glance, the Republicans appear to
have gathered in hostile political territory, but an overwhelming
Democratic registration edge masks growing Republican strength in
Louisiana.
   New Orleans Mayor Sidney Barthelemy, a Jesse Jackson Democrat
and a vice chairman of the national Democratic Party, leads a city
where registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans 189,741
to 34,853.
   Statewide, there are 2,146,867 registered voters and only about
322,000 of them _ 15 percent _ are Republicans.
   In the Legislature, there are 23 Republicans among the 144
members.
   Republicans have been scarce in Louisiana since Reconstruction.
   Populist Democrats like Huey Long, who taxed oil companies to
provide free state services, further cemented the Democrats' hold
on the state. When blacks became a voting force as a result of the
civil rights movement, Democrats broadened their base, despite
occasional defections by white voters to states' rights candidates.
   But things are looking up for the Louisiana GOP. Republicans
have won five of the last eight presidential races in the state.
Half of Louisiana's eight U.S. House members are Republicans now.
   Ten years ago, Republican registration was just 79,900 and the
long-standing joke was that they could hold the state convention in
a telephone booth.
   Chinks in the Democrats' Louisiana fortress first were seen more
than 30 years ago, when the state went for Dwight D. Eisenhower in
the 1956 presidential race. In later years, Louisiana's electoral
votes went to Republicans Barry Goldwater in 1964, Richard Nixon in
1972 and Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984.
   In 1972, Dave Treen, after three losing campaigns, became the
first Republican to win a congressional seat in Louisiana since
Reconstruction.
   Treen later became the first Republican governor since
Reconstruction when he was elected to the post in 1979. Ironically,
he was helped by a law the Democrats had pushed to help themselves
_ the unique ``open primary'' law.
   All candidates from all parties run in one election. If no
candidate wins a majority, the top two finishers, regardless of
party, face a runoff.
   The law was designed to keep Democrats from exhausting their
energies and campaign funds in volatile primary battles against
each other only to face a single, well-financed Republican in a
general election.
   But, since anyone could vote _ regardless of party registration
_ it allowed conservative Democrats to cross party lines and vote
for Republicans.
   
   In addition to GOP House gains, former Republican Rep. Henson
Moore forced Democrat John Breaux to wage a tough, come-from-behind
battle in 1986 to keep Democratic control of the Senate seat left
vacant by the retirement of Russell Long, a powerful Democrat and
son of Huey Long.
   All is not roses for the Republicans in Louisiana, even with the
open primary.
   For example, Democrats remain so strong that the planners for
the 1988 GOP convention yanked Democratic Mayor Barthelemy off the
schedule for their nationally televised opening night ceremonies so
his welcoming remarks would be made during a less conspicuous
morning session.
   After his 1986 loss to Breaux, Moore said he did not think a
Republican could beat a Democrat in a head-to-head match.
   That was three years after Treen was overwhelmingly defeated
when popular two-term governor Edwin Edwards, a Democrat, returned
to politics after a four-year hiatus.
   And, although Edwards' political fortunes fell with the price of
oil and the state's poor economy, it took another Democrat, Buddy
Roemer, to drive Edwards out of office in last year's election.
   Roemer came from the back of a five-man pack to beat Edwards and
Rep. Robert Livingston, the Republican who had been considered a
sure bet for a runoff with Edwards.
   Treen believes the Louisiana GOP's growing strength results in
part from the tenacity of Republicans like him who ran against
enormous odds in the 1950s and 1960s.
   ``If I had the wisdom of my present age, which is 60, when I ran
for Congress, I probably would not have run for Congress back in
1962,'' he said. But he does not regret it.
   ``That race led to the '64 race and the '68 race ... and
eventually to the race I won in 1972.''

<TEXT>
   New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu is leading a
Republican National Convention assault on his neighbor, Michael
Dukakis, saying the Democratic nominee has displayed ``an absolute
incapacity to manage.''
   Sununu, a frequent critic of the Massachusetts governor,
conducted a spirited denunciation of the Dukakis record on the eve
of the GOP convention. And Sununu, who will speak to the convention
Tuesday night, added: ``I'm saving the good stuff.''
   ``It takes an absolute incapacity to manage to have reached the
fiscal chaos that Massachusetts has today,'' Sununu said at a news
conference Sunday following a meeting of Republican governors and
former governors.
   He was joined by a half-dozen other governors as he attacked
Dukakis' management of the Massachusetts budget in the face of a
severe deficit this year.
   He said Dukakis failed to take steps that other governors did to
head off a deficit when they saw indications of an economic
slowdown. To deal with the resulting shortage, Dukakis resorted to
borrowing from the retirement fund for state employee pensions, as
well as tax increases, Sununu said.
   ``The fact is that Michael Dukakis had no handle on his budget.
Michael Dukakis had no capacity to deal with a tough situation that
he created on his own,'' Sununu said. ``Michael Dukakis had no
management understanding, in a timely way, of what should have been
done, and what Michael Dukakis has done since then in order to deal
with next year's deficit is absolutely irresponsible.''
   He used the word ``steal'' to describe the state's borrowing
from its pension system and said the action ``ought to strike fear
in the hearts of anyone who draws a Social Security check.''
   At a brunch earlier, former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee
delivered a plea for the GOP not to forget that states need to take
action to deal with problems, even while the Republicans ``put a
harness on the government in Washington.''
   ``Somebody's got to fix the schools and save the outdoors and
fix the roads and clean the streets,'' he said. ``And you don't get
to be a governing conservative majority by voting `no' in
Washington alone. Most of the work that's done on schools and jobs
and the outdoors is done by governors.''
   Gov. Michael Castle of Delaware, chairman of the GOP governors,
urged a close examination of Dukakis' record during his three terms
as governor of Massachusetts, saying the state had merely benefited
from an economic boom throughout New England.
   ``There is some concern that the `Massachusetts Miracle,' which
has been presented by Michael Dukakis, may not be quite a
miracle,'' Castle said, referring to the Dukakis campaign slogan
for the state's economic health. ``... Perhaps it's a Massachusetts
mirage.''
   At Dukakis campaign headquarters in Boston, spokesman Steve Akey
did not immediately return a reporter's call seeking comment.

   A restoration effort this summer is
returning the stately old Minnesota Senate chamber to the way it
looked in 1905 when fellows who carried pocket watches and used
spittoons debated there.
   It'll cost the taxpayers $21 million before it's over in
December, but those purple walls will be a thing of the past. They
will be repainted to a peach tone, to go with the new red rug.
   ``These colors are all wrong,'' said Sen. Donald Moe, who heads
a subcommittee in charge of the restoration. ``The purple should
not be here. We can't find anyone who will admit recommending it.''
It went on in the 1970s.
   The building's exterior also will be cleaned and repaired, and
new gold leaf will be applied to the ball atop the dome.

   Police in Orange County say they've
found an almost foolproof way to reduce the number of raucous
parties in their cities: bill the hosts for the time it takes to
break up the noisy get-togethers.
   Eleven Orange County cities have approved ordinances within the
past year enabling police to take such action.
   Under the ordinances, if police have to return after issuing a
warning, the host will be billed for personnel and equipment costs.
   ``It's worked beyond our wildest dreams,'' Fullerton police Sgt.
Gary Miller said.
   ``Since it went into effect, I guess that there are 1,000
parties we've gone to, and I think we've gone back (a second time)
10 times,'' Miller said.
   Hosts, however, have not been overly thrilled about paying up.
   Mike Lasater of La Habra said he has no intention of paying his
bill, even if it is only $16.44.
   ``I ain't paying it,'' he said. ``They can take me to jail for
$16.''
   Lasater, who threw a party for his daughter's high school
graduation in June, said he immediately broke up the party after
his first warning, but some guests lingered in the street and
police had to disperse them.
   ``The city hasn't chosen what to do if people ignore the
billing,'' said Capt. John Rees of the La Habra Police Department.

   Firing volleys of tear gas, riot
police on Monday broke off a student march to the North Korean
border to press for reunification. Police arrested and beat scores
of protesters.
   About 2,500 students holding red and blue banners tried to march
out of Yonsei University to go to the border truce village of
Panmunjom, about 30 miles away.
   Hundreds of riot troopers in green combat fatigues and
black-visored helmets confronted students as soon as they exited
the main gate.
   Some officers were seen beating students with riot shields and
making flkying karate kicks at fleeing protesters.
   The students did not fight back and most were unarmed except for
a few carrying clubs. Some students hurled a few stones, but the
protesters only fought back with clubs and rocks when the police
charged into the campus.
   Dozens of students seized by police huddled on the ground,
clinging to each other as police hit and kicked them. Some students
cried with pain and senior police officers hit some of their own
troopers to try and stop the beating.
   The students made three atrempts to march out of the main gate.
Each time, they were driven back by charging police and armored
vans firing tear gas.
   The students marched out after a rally to call for reunification
with communist North Korea. They wanted to go to Panmunjom for
talks with North Korean student delegates on reuniting the divided
Korean pensinsula.
   The government banned the march and deployed more than 20,000
riot police to stop it.
   On Sunday, hundreds of students at Yonsei and another college in
central Seoul battled riot police with firebombs and rocks, and
furious residents demanded a halt to the protests to protect the
Olympics.
   Fewer students appeared to be involved than in clashes on
Saturday. The few thousand radicals involved in the protests have
virtually no public support and clashes were confined to two or
three small areas.
   Students tried to stage a number of demonstrations in downtown
Seoul, but handfuls of protesters were dispersed quickly by
hundreds of riot police. Police said more than 5,000 riot troops
were deployed to block the protests.
   National Police Headquarters said hundreds of people were
arrested, but it had no overall figures. Officials said 1,027
protesters were arrested in clashes Saturday and 63 troopers
injured, most in clashes around Yonsei.
   Police halted and searched students entering or leaving Yonsei
on Sunday. Dozens of students were arrested and troops were seen
beating and kicking some detainees.
   Angry residents and shopkeepers staged several counter-protests
to demand that students stop violent demonstrations. Onlookers
heckled student demonstrators in the city. ``No firebombs by
students,'' they shouted.
   About 200 residents went to the main gate of Yonsei Sunday to
demand students end the protest, but the students refused.
   Citizens also argued with protesters near the city's Myondong
Cathedral, accusing them of sabotaging the Summer Olympics
scheduled to begin in Seoul Sept. 17. People told the students
their protests embarrassed the nation.
   A column of about 1,000 people who said they belonged to the
previously unknown ``Youth League for Protection of the Nation''
staged a march in central Seoul, chanting: ``Successful Olympics
and economic development.'' Dozens of onlookers applauded.
   Students attacked some of the group's marchers with sticks and
rocks near Seoul National University Medical School before being
driven off by police.
   President Roh Tae-woo warned Friday that violent protests were a
threat to the Olympics and had to be stopped.
   Radical students have seized on the reunification issue to try
to mobilize public support for their anti-government campaign. The
radicals, a small but powerful minority on campuses, have failed to
gain support because of violent tactics and open advances to the
communist north.
   The students say they are not communists but insist the
peninsula be reunited immediately, with political differences to be
worked out later. Most South Koreans fear the north is determined
to conquer them.
   The radical students also demand removal of the 42,000 U.S.
troops in South Korea.
   The Korean peninsula has been divided since 1945 at the end of
World War II. North Korea invaded the south in 1950 to start the
Korean War.

   Citing the potential of terrorist attack,
members of Congress are putting the Reagan administration on notice
that they will strongly oppose any move to permit sea shipment of
plutonium from Europe to Japan.
   ``Here you have an administration that is supposedly waging a
war on terrorism, but promoting a policy that could make terrorism
easy,'' said Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., a member of the House
Foreign Affairs Committee.
   The issue stems from a recently signed U.S.-Japan nuclear
cooperation treaty that authorizes shipments by air of plutonium
from reprocessing plants in Europe back to Japan, where it will be
used to fuel nuclear power plants.
   The plutonium, which also could be utilized for nuclear weapons,
is controlled by the U.S. government because the nuclear fuel
originated in the United States.
   Proceeding with the air shipments was made contingent upon
development of crash-proof shipping casks, which so far has proven
unachievable.
   In the face of that, the Japanese have been seeking to amend the
nuclear cooperation treaty to give 30-year advance approval for
shipment by sea. Such a ``subsequent arrangement'' must be reviewed
by Congress.
   Wolpe said late last week that amending the U.S.-Japan accord
would face significant opposition on Capitol Hill.
   ``Congress will have a 15-day review period when it will be very
difficult for the Reagan administration to explain how, if we are
not shipping plutonium by air because it is not yet safe, we can
consider shipping plutonium by sea, which is a proven danger,'' he
said.
   The Michigan Democrat joined with 13 other House members and
four senators in sending a letter this month to President Reagan,
expressing their concern over reports that his administration has
agreed in principle to allow sea shipment.
   They cited a March 1988 Pentagon study which said ``the Office
of the Secretary of Defense, joint staff and services have
concluded that air shipment via the polar route is preferable to
sea shipment.''
   The study warned that during sea shipment ``the vessel is
accessible and vulnerable throughout the voyage, particularly when
the vessel is passing through channels, straits, and other
restricted waterways (`choke points'), or when it is near the
coast.''
   ``Even if the most careful precautions are observed no one could
guarantee the safety of the cargo from a security incident, such as
an attack on the vessel by small, fast craft, especially if armed
with modern anti-ship missiles,'' it said.
   The only previous sea shipment of plutonium from Europe to Japan
took place in 1984, when the cargo ship was escorted by U.S.,
French and Japanese naval vessels and monitored constantly by
satellite.
   Deputy Secretary of State John C. Whitehead dealt with the
plutonium issue in a May 30 letter to members of the House Foreign
Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations committees.
   In the letter, Whitehead said: ``The administration will
consider programmatic shipment of plutonium under adequate physical
security pursuant to the implementing agreement. Such an
arrangement would be treated by the administration as a subsequent
arrangement in accordance with Section 131 of the Atomic Energy
Act.''
   A State Department official, who spoke on condition that he not
be identified, said: ``The government of Japan approached the U.S.
government on this issue and requested discussions. Officials of
Japan and the United States met in July to begin the discussions,
and further discussions are taking place in Japan.''
   He said there was no indication how long the talks would
continue.
   The Department of Energy has said it expects that each sea
shipment would involve more than 200 kilograms, or 440 pounds, of
plutonium.
   According to the Nuclear Control Institute, a Washington-based
nuclear non-proliferation policy group, approximately 15 pounds of
plutonium would be enough to make a nuclear weapon.
   ``This transportation controversy underscores the very real
dangers of civilian plutonium commerce,'' said Alan Kuperman, the
institute's issues director. ``It should prompt Japan to reconsider
its commitment to recycling plutonium.''
   Along with Wolpe, House members signing the Aug. 4 letter to
Reagan were Reps. Don Bonker, D-Wash.; Ted Weiss, D-N.Y.; Gary L.
Ackerman, D-N.Y.; Chester G. Atkins, D-Mass.; Peter H. Kostmayer,
D-Pa.; George J. Hochbrueckner, D-N.Y.; James H. Bilbray, D-Nev.;
George W. Crockett Jr., D-Mich.; Gus Yatron, D-Pa.; Howard L.
Berman, D-Calif.; Edward F. Feighan, D-Ohio; Edward J. Markey,
D-Mass., and Mel Levine, D-Calif.
   Also signing it were Sens. William Proxmire, D-Wis.; Rudy
Boschwitz, R-Minn.; Paul Simon, D-Ill., and John F. Kerry, D-Mass.

   Should you give money to a beggar?
   Some people who work with the down and out say you should, while
others believe the most charitable response is to say ``no.''
   Last week, New York City Mayor Edward I. Koch announced an
advertising program to discourage people from giving money. ``In
most cases, in my judgment, the money that you give in the street
to beggars goes for booze and drugs,'' said Koch.
   A person or persons unknown rented four billboards last month in
El Paso, Texas, to say: ``Please don't give to beggars _ they cause
traffic problems.'' Many of the beggars cross from Ciudad Juarez in
Mexico.
   In Washington, the Downtown Seattle Association distributes
brochures advising: ``Give a hand, not a handout.''
   ``The main reason people are panhandling is to support alcohol
and drug problems,'' said Jean DeMaster, director of Burnside
Projects, which runs a shelter for street people in Portland, Ore.
``I am absolutely convinced that if people didn't give money to
panhandlers, the matter of panhandling would be drastically
reduced, and more people would be forced to come in for alcohol and
drug treatment.''
   Lisa Thomas, Project Director of Health Care for the Homeless in
Cleveland, said money given to beggars may only encourage a drug or
alcohol habit.
   ``I don't give money to people in the street and I tell my
friends not to,'' Ms. Thomas said. ``You never know where the money
is going.''
   Gloria Guard, director of the People's Emergency Center, a
shelter in west Philadelphia, said there is no right or wrong
response. ``It really has much more to do with my own wanting to
take the opportunity to give something to somebody.''
   Kevin Hooper, social services secretary for the Salvation Army
in Philadelphia, said an encounter with a beggar could be positive
even if no money is given. ``I would hope people would internalize
that, and ask themselves, why are people on the street asking for
money?''
   ``I think it's important to make a decision about whether or not
you're going to give someone money, not just to walk away or assume
they're going to use it for a drink or something harmful,'' said
Mark Baker, director of community relations and advocacy for the
Pine Street Inn shelter in Boston.
   ``You just can't ignore people,'' Baker added. ``The tip is to
look at a beggar as another person with real needs.''

<HEAD>Navy Mum on Report Only One Officer to Be Disciplined</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci should
receive a report this week from a Navy board that investigated the
downing of an Iranian passenger airliner by the USS Vincennes, the
Pentagon says.
   Navy Cmdr. Mel Sutton confirmed on Sunday that the panel has
completed its work, but he refused to discuss a published report
saying the board recommended disciplinary action against only one
officer aboard the ship.
   All 290 people aboard the plane were killed when it was shot
down over the Persian Gulf on July 3. The Vincennes had
misidentified the plane as an F-14 fighter.
   ``The report went up, and, if not already, will be in the hands
of the (defense) secretary this week,'' Sutton said. ``We expect a
public report in the near future.''
   Sutton refused to discuss a story in Sunday's editions of The
Washington Post, which said the board's report calls for
disciplining only the ship's operations officer. The story said
that officer, who has not been identified publicly, drew most of
the blame for his role in misinterpreting information that resulted
in a decision to fire on the plane.
   The newspaper said the report reaches the general conclusion
that the tragedy resulted from a series of human errors, not from
any major malfunction in the ship's sophisticated Aegis radar
systems.
   The Post quoted Defense Department officials as saying the
report of the investigating team, headed by Rear Adm. William N.
Fogarty, could be changed before it is made public.
   However, the story added, the officials said there is little
inclination to go hard on any Navy personnel connected with the
downing of the jet, from Rear Adm. Anthony A. Less, commander of
the naval task force in the Persian Gulf, to the sailors who
misinterpreted the radar data.
   The proposed discipline against the operations officer would be
one of the lightest available to the Navy: a letter of reprimand
that would not made a part of the officer's permanent record.

   Edward Bennett Williams, the esteemed trial
lawyer and sports entrepreneur, rarely appeared in court when it
was not crowded with fellow attorneys who wanted to see a master at
work.
   ``He was a role model for every honest, tough criminal lawyer in
the postwar era,'' said Alan Dershowitz, a criminal lawyer and
Harvard law school professor.
   Lawyer Clark Clifford, an adviser to presidents, said, ``The bar
has lost perhaps its most outstanding advocate.''
   EBW, as he was known to his friends and co-workers, died
Saturday evening in Georgetown University Hospital at age 68 after
battling cancer for the past 11 years, undergoing seven operations
but returning to work as soon as possible after each one.
   Joseph Califano, a former law partner and a member of President
Jimmy Carter's Cabinet, said, ``He was the best. He was the best
everything. He was the best father, the best husband, the best
lawyer, the best partner, the best friend ... and he was
extraordinarily brave.''
   A funeral mass for Williams will be held Tuesday at St.
Matthew's Cathedral here where he often attended morning mass
before he went to work a few blocks away.
   He made his reputation in the law defending the powerful in
their times of greatest need. As a sideline, he also was a one-time
president of the Washington Redskins of the National Football
League and the owner of the Baltimore Orioles baseball team at the
time of his death.
   Clients ranged from corporate giants such as The Washington Post
Co. and personalities such as Frank Sinatra and William F. Buckley
Jr. to some of the most notorious figures of the day.
   Among them were Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy, the red-baiting
Wisconsin Republican; Frank Costello, the New York Mafia leader;
James R. Hoffa, the president of the Teamsters Union; stock
swindler Robert Vesco, and Igor Melekh, a Russian employee of the
United Nations who was accused of espionage.
   Other Williams clients included such Washington figures as John
Connally, the former Texas governor who was Treasury secretary in
the Nixon administration, and Richard Helms, the former director of
the CIA.
   ``He deployed a wide variety of emotions to motivate people,''
said partner Vincent Fuller. ``If you didn't know him, you could be
overwhelmed by him. When I was very young, perhaps I was afraid of
him. I later found him perfectly reasonable.''
   Another partner, Brendan Sullivan, said, ``He would not count
among his friends people who were frightened by him. His friends
were of equal will, or they were not his friends.''
   Williams was born on May 31, 1920, in Hartford, Conn. In 1941,
he graduated summa cum laude from Holy Cross College. He came to
Washington to study law at Georgetown University.
   In 1949, Williams left a promising career at Hogan & Hartson,
one of Washington's largest and most prestigious firms, to set up
his own office.
   Survivors include his wife, Agnes Anne Neill, a former lawyer in
his law firm; three children by his first wife and four children by
his second.

<TEXT>
   Videotapes of Oliver L. North's
confrontational testimony before Congress last year are for sale at
the Republican National Convention, but the indicted former White
House aide is not here in the flesh.
   Neither are former national security adviser John Poindexter,
former Attorney General Edwin Meese III, ex-White House aide
Michael K. Deaver nor a host of other one-time Reagan
administration officials whose ethical conduct was questioned.
   An exception is Lyn Nofziger, Reagan's former political director
who was convicted of illegally lobbying the executive branch.
Nofziger said he planned to help former Education Secretary William
Bennett with his convention speech.
   This is Vice President George Bush's convention, and the
soon-to-be GOP presidential nominee obviously wants to distance
himself from what critics have called the administration's ``sleaze
factor.''
   ``He is an honest, open, ethical person who has high standards
for himself and the people around him,'' said Iowa Gov. Terry
Branstad.
   Another Midwesterner, Gov. Michael Hayden of Kansas said Bush
can insulate himself from ethical criticism by building a ``wall of
credibility'' around himself. As a first step, Hayden said Bush
must select aides and associates whose behavior is beyond reproach.
   Bush has stressed his openness by releasing financial data,
including his tax returns and a statement from his doctor about his
medical condition.
   The vice president also suggested that Meese's conduct did not
meet the standards he would set for his Cabinet members, though he
never called for Meese's resignation. Meese, who left office last
Friday, said he strongly supports Bush's nomination, but planned to
take a vacation with his family this week.
   Independent counsel James McKay investigated Meese's conduct
while in office. McKay said he would not bring charges against
Meese, although Meese probably violated conflict-of-interest and
tax laws. Meese denied any wrongdoing, and compared his case to
that of former Labor Secretary Ray Donovan who was acquitted on
fraud charges.
   The Republicans have touched briefly on ethics in their
platform, focusing exclusively on activities of the
Democrat-controlled Congress, primarily the House.
   In Congress, ``outright offenses against ethical standards and
public laws are treated lightly,'' and members ``protect their
cronies charged with personal misconduct or criminal activities,''
the document says.
   While more than a dozen Reagan administration officials have
left under a cloud, Indiana Gov. Robert Orr doubted the Democrats
would make a big deal about the issue during the 1988 presidential
campaign. ``It's a bum issue for the Democrats to pursue; they
could find themselves hoist by their own petards,'' he said.
   In the House, Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, is the subject of an
investigation by the ethics committee. The panel has hired an
independent counsel to look into large royalties Wright received
from a book published by a campaign contributor.
   ``There is sleaze on both sides,'' said Clopha Deshotel of the
American Freedom Coalition, a conservative lobbying group that is
selling the Oliver North videotapes for $25, along with pictures of
North for $5 and bumper stickers that say ``Pardon Ollie'' and
``Two Wrongs Make A Wright.''
   North and his ex-boss, John Poindexter, are awaiting trial on
charges of conspiracy to defraud the United States for their role
in the Iran-Contra affair. North also is charged with accepting
gratuities and destroying documents.
   North, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel, has hit the lecture
circuit, receiving as much as $25,000 a speech. He also has
campaigned for Republican candidates in California and Florida.
   But Republican officials say they have no word that North will
appear at the convention. Said Deshotel: ``It would be like Elvis;
he would upstage the event.''
   The allegations against administration officials vary widely.
Deaver, the former deputy chief of staff, was convicted of perjury
in an ethics investigation.
   Others convicted were Rita Lavelle, former head of the
Environmental Protection Agency's toxic waste clean-up program who
was found guilty of lying to Congress; Paul Thayer, a deputy
secretary of defense who served 19 months for lying about insider
stock trading, and C. McClain Haddow, a top official at Health and
Human Services who pleaded guilty to pocketing $55,330 from a
non-profit foundation he started.
   Others who ran into trouble were Richard V. Allen, a former
national security adviser who resigned amid questions about his
acceptance of gifts from the Japanese; Anne Gorsuch Burford, a
former EPA administrator who resigned amid allegations of agency
mismanagement and possible conflict of interest, and J. Lynn Helms,
former administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration who
resigned after reports that he was involved in questionable
business dealings.

<TEXT>
   An ordinance aimed at aggressive beggars seems to
have reduced the number of confrontations between panhandlers and
pedestrians, but didn't prevent the death of a passerby who said no.
   Seattle's law went into effect Nov. 27, after years of attempts
by some officials and downtown businessmen alarmed by pushy
beggars. The law has served as a model for at least two other
cities.
   ``There has been a significant reduction in the amount of
aggressive behavior along with panhandling,'' said Capt. Jim
Deschane, commander of the city's West Precinct, which includes the
Pioneer Square district, where many confrontations took place
before the ordinance went into effect.
   ``Some of them were pretty frightening,'' said John Gilmore,
executive vice president of the Downtown Seattle Association. ``I
don't see them there anymore.''
   Still, on July 9, a man who told a woman panhandler to get a job
was knocked unconscious by the woman's boyfriend, and died two days
later, authorities said. James Nightwolf, who had a record of
violent behavior, was charged with second degree murder, said
homicide Sgt. Joe Sanford.
   The ordinance, which prohibits panhandlers from intimidating or
blocking passersby, carries a maximum penalty of 90 days in jail
and a $500 fine.
   Minneapolis enacted an ordinance in February making it illegal
to use offensive language, grab or follow someone if it
``reasonably tends to arouse alarm or anger.'' Violations are
punishable by up to 90 days in jail and $700 fines.
   ``It really hasn't been as effective an ordinance as it could
be,'' said Van White, the councilman who sponsored Minneapolis'
ordinance. ``If (police) would just begin to arrest and take them
off the street, and get them a warning that they can go to court.''
   Minneapolis police Lt. Michael Fisher said he could not say how
many arrests had been made, because begging is lumped with public
drunkenness and similar offenses. ``The ordinance made it easier to
prosecute. It didn't make it easier to enforce,'' he said.
   A similar ordinance, enacted in Portland, Ore., in April 1987,
wasn't specifically aimed at begging but prohibits interfering with
pedestrians or with people leaving and entering public or private
property. The law has been used to arrest anti-abortion protesters
as well as street people.
   ``That particular ordinance has been a failure as far as doing
what I expected it to do,'' said Lou Wachsmuth, owner of Dan &
Louis Oyster Bar in downtown Portland. The panhandlers ``have no
fear of the police. I tell them to leave, and they tell me to go
jump in the lake.''
   Portland police Capt. Roberta Webber acknowledged that the
ordinance has been used sparingly. ``The problem is that we have to
see (an offense) occurring. Most people who are harassed don't
report it,'' she said.
   The city commission in Tulsa, Okla., approved an ordinance July
15, based on Seattle's, that makes it a violation to repeatedly beg
_ more than once an hour _ for money or to obstruct a pedestrian's
passage while begging. Violators can be fined $100.
   Seattle police made 121 arrests under its law in the first half
of this year, but Deschane said the threat of arrest has been most
important for officers.
   ``They can simply warn people, which works remarkably well,'' he
said.
   Aggressive panhandling, which was the most frequent complaint in
the precinct last summer, has dropped below on-the-street narcotics
dealing and public drinking this summer, Deschane said.
   Bill Hobson, director of the Downtown Emergency Services Center,
said official concern is overblown. In five years working downtown,
he said, he never witnessed such panhandling.
   ``It seems to me, most of it is done in an almost polite,
ingratiating fashion,'' he said, adding many of downtown's beggars
are impaired by mental illness and alcoholism.
   A municipal court judge in May ruled that Seattle's ordinance
was unconstitutionally vague, but Deschane said other municipal
judges have not embraced that view. Until a higher court rules, he
said, ``we're still enforcing the law.''
   Gilmore said the business association is trying to persuade
those who give to beggars to donate instead to shelters serving the
homeless. In New York, where there is no ordinance against begging,
Mayor Edward I. Koch made a similar suggestion last week.
   The Seattle association publishes a brochure that gives this
advice: ``Give a hand, not a handout.''

   Black and Hispanic Republicans had kind words
for President Reagan's minority hiring record, but grumbled about
the opening today of a national convention overwhelmingly dominated
by white men.
   ``What we have to do is start making ourselves known at the
local level,'' said George Smith, a black delegate from San Diego.
``Hopefully, four years from now, the dismal, small number will be
increased.
   ``I don't want anyone taking me for granted,'' he said.
   More than 1,000 delegates and activists gathered on the
outskirts of the sweltering convention city Sunday night for an
evening-long tribute to Reagan's role in naming minority group
members to his administration.
   They also gave him credit for boosting the economy, which they
called the best possible program for the poor.
   ``You've got a tremendous record here,'' said Bill Wilson, a
spokesman for the Council of Minority Americans, the group
organizing the tribute. ``You can't get any economic clout if you
can't get a job.''
   But there was an undercurrent of unhappiness about this week's
convention, with just over 92 percent white delegates, compared to
68 percent at last month's Democratic National Convention. Roughly
3 percent of the GOP delegates are black.
   ``It's too low, we all know that,'' said Clarence Thomas,
chairman of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a
black Reagan administration appointee honored at the meeting. ``The
party has to do more than just passively sit back. We want to be
critical without being antagonistic.''
   The gathering was held in a sprawling, corrugated metal building
miles from the Superdome where the convention kicks off today. The
building houses floats used in Mardi Gras parades, so activists
milled about under giant papier-mache caricatures of kings and
revelers and occasionally posed for pictures next to the more
outrageous examples.
   At one point, activists argued that Republicans can lure more
black voters, while the strains of ``Dixie'' wafted from the
bandstand. The song, which expresses nostalgia for the old South,
is considered offensive to some blacks.
   Neighbors in the heavily black section of the city looked on
curiously from across the street. The Republican convention city is
55.1 percent black.
   
   There has been criticism over the past week about the tiny
minority population to be seated in the Superdome today.
   Alan Keyes, a Senate candidate in Maryland who is black, said
Republicans are too leery of newcomers regardless of race.
   ``I think there is a problem with the representational structure
of the party,' he said.
   Keyes was in an earlier flap with convention organizers that
underscored the occasionally tense relations between the GOP and
minorities. He is scheduled to address the convention Wednesday,
and publicly complained that organizers wanted him to emphasize his
race in the speech.
   Another criticism of GOP organizers came earlier in the day from
John Rondeno, a New Orleans financial planner running a reception
center for delegates favoring vanquished presidential candidate Pat
Robertson.
   ``I think the Republican Party right now is limited,'' said
Rondeno. ``Unfortunately, the Republican Party has been the party
of `keep it small and keep it all'. Blacks in the Republican Party
were totally excluded from this convention.''
   Most attending Sunday night's dinner and reception, however,
preferred to stress the potential gain for both minorities and
Republicans in a stronger relationship. But they made it clear that
the party's establishment must extend a hand in welcome.
   ``That's what the Republican Party has to do, open up its
doors,'' said Californian Smith. ``The party has to have more
blacks at all levels, at all echelons.''
   ``This is designed to let the convention know there are
minorities who do support the ticket,'' said Lawrence King, an
Omaha, Neb., businessman who organized the group.
   King shrugged off questions about the number of blacks and other
minorities at the convention.
   ``I think that's basically the way things are,'' he said.
``There are not a lot of black Republicans.''

   A maximum-security inmate covered a small
opening in his cell door with butter and slipped through it, then
escaped with another inmate, authorities said.
   Both inmates escaped from the Mississippi State Penitentiary's
grounds by scaling a 12-foot fence and were on the loose 17 hours
before being captured Sunday evening, officials said.
   Clarence R. Gillie, 23, who is 5-feet-9 and weighs 145 pounds,
squeezed through an opening used to pass food trays, said Ken
Jones, a state corrections department spokesman.
   Gillie was able to leave his cell when another inmate diverted
the guard by telling the officer he had a plumbing problem in his
cell.
   Gillie then threatened the officer with a homemade knife, and
freed the other inmate, Ronald Brown, 21, Jones said.
   Gillie was serving 24 years for burglary, grand larceny and
escape and faced a murder charge in Arkansas, Jones said.
   Brown was serving five years for burglary, he said.

<HEAD>Transcript of Reagan's Remarks At Welcoming Rally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a transcript of President Reagan's
remarks Sunday at a welcoming rally on the eve of the Republican
National Convention.
   Thank you.
   It's great to be in New Orleans.
   You know, I always feel at home here in Louisiana, because, you
know, I'm the fellow that talked Tom Jefferson into buying it.
   I'm really looking forward to tomorrow night in the Superdome.
   It's going to prove something I've always suspected, that when I
finally got to the home of the Saints, it would be filled with
Republicans.
   I can understand the opposition rejecting New Orleans as their
convention city, though. They really would have had trouble
readjusting here _ after all, they think the Sugar Bowl is located
in Washington and is known as the United States Treasury.
   But I can guarantee one site here would have made them feel at
home. We Republicans love our bandwagon, but all that other party's
got is a streetcar named Desire.
   This may surprise you, but today I want to point out
similarities between myself and both of the nominees at the top of
the other ticket.
   You see, in one way, I'm just like their vice presidential
nominee. Neither one of us shares the political views of their
presidential nominee.
   Well, come to think of it, I do have one thing in common with
the fella at the top of their ticket _ come this January, neither
one of us will be holding a federal office.

   But, I confess to all of you, I did miss that other convention
this summer. I did read, though, all about it, those great issues
and ideas, and I've got to admit I found them pretty interesting
when I first heard them back some years ago.
   But, believe me, I know better than to even mention their
platform in a city that takes such pride in its cuisine, its
cooking. Who would dare discuss in front of the proud people of New
Orleans anything so rehashed, so reheated and so often rejected?
   But ladies and gentlemen, the truth is that platform was one of
the most artful dodges in American political history. It was an
outright refusal by the liberal leadership of the other party to
level with the American, to deal with the issues, to tell the
American people, especially independents and rank-and-file
Democrats, what the liberal leadership really has in store for us
should they be victorious.
   And they gave us one, huge, glaring clue to all that when they
said at the Atlanta convention, this was a campaign about
competence, not ideology.
   Now, let's be honest. If they really were a campaign about
competence, if they were really a battle of the resumes, I just
happen to think that the former captain of the Yale foot _ baseball
team, the youngest flier in the Navy with 58 combat missions, the
former Texas wildcatter who turned down a soft job on Wall Street
to make his own way, the former member of the House of
Representatives from Texas, the former Republican national chairman
_ hang on, there's more _ the former ambassador to the United
Nations, the former de factor ambassador in China, the director of
central intelligence, and the current vice president of the United
States, who's handed every tough issue from deregulation, to drugs,
to terrorism, frankly I think the fellow with that resume has it
all.
   So _ (crowd chants George Bush's name) _ you're right. That's
his name.
   So, why did they say it? Well, you see when they came right out
at that convention and said this is a campaign not about ideology
but about competence, they were really telegraphing their greatest
weakness, the very thing that worries them and their advisers most,
to every state in the union, to every voter in America, and that's
their liberal record and that of the liberal leadership of their
party in Congress.

   They know what they intend to do once in office. But they don't
want the American people to find out until after the election.
   And that's where we come in. You and me.
   We Republicans know the truth: that convention in Atlanta was
the biggest masquerade since last year's Mardi Gras here in New
Orleans.
   And so we're here this week for one purpose: to get our message
to the American people, to prove to the liberal leadership of the
other party, starting here, and starting now, their attempt to hide
their stand on the issues isn't going to work.
   The masquerade is over. The stealth candidacy has to _ to come
out from cover. It's time to talk issues, to use the dreaded ``L''
word, to say the policies of our opposition and the congressional
leadership of his party are liberal, liberal, liberal.
   The choice before the American people this year is just as clear
as it was in 1980 and 1984. A choice _ a choice between, on the one
hand, the policies of limited government, economic growth, a strong
defense and a firm foreign policy, and, on the other hand, policies
of tax and spend, economic stagnation, international weakness and
accommodation, and always, always, always blame America first.
   Yes, the choice this year is between the policies of liberalism
or the policies of America's political mainstream.

   But you and I understand that just having Republicans know all
this isn't good enough. Our great victories of 1980 and '84 were
based on millions of independents and rank and file Democrats who
came our way. Their votes _ especially those of traditional
Democrats _ is the key battleground.
   And here we have an advantage: because on economic, social and
foreign policy issues, those conservative-minded Democrats agree
with us.
   And, you know, you know, some people _ and I've been a little
flattered by this _ refer to this group as Reagan Democrats. Well,
well, if it's true, that I have an ``in'' with those Democrats,
here's what I want to say to them today, and what I hope you'll say
to them when you get back home: ``You're right to feel
uncomfortable about the leadership of the party you and I once
pledged loyalty to. A party that once stood for the broad interests
of America's working men and women has become a party fixated on
the narrow agenda of the liberal elites and special interest
groups. The power of liberal pressure groups in the party has grown
so great that the rest of their candidates this year, the ones who
voted for strong defense or tax cuts, didn't even dare to get into
the primaries.
   ``Yes,'' I would say to rank-and-file Democrats, ``a once-proud
party of hope and affirmation has become dominated at the top by
strident liberalism and negativism. The party of `yes' has become
the party of `no.' `No' to holding the line on taxes, `no' to
spending cuts, `no' to the line-item veto, `no' to the
balanced-budget amendment, `no' to the death penalty, `no' to
tough-minded judges, `no' to enterprise zones, `no' to the school
prayer amendment, `no' to the right to life, `no' to adequate
defense spending, `no' to a strategic defense system that protects
America from nuclear missiles, Central America, `no' to help those
_ for fighting for _ keep Central America safe from communism, `no'
to liberating Grenada, `no' to a policy in the Persian Gulf that's
helped ending war in that region, `no' to a negotiating stance that
has brought us the first nuclear arms reduction treaty in history,
`no' to the foreign policy of strength and purpose that has told
the truth about communism and helped bring the first signs of
change to the Soviet Union in seven decades.''
   And I would also say to those rank-and-file Democrats, ``In all
these ways, the liberal leadership of your party has been saying
`no' to you. And now it's time for you to start saying `no' to
them. And the best _ (crowd chanting ``Just say no'') _ all right,
the best way to do that is by saying `yes' to George Bush; and
`yes'' to a new Congress, a Congress that will work with the new
president, not against him, a Republican Congress.
   My fellow Republicans, this is the message we must carry to
America this week and beyond. For too long, the control of the
Congress has been in the hands of the liberal leadership. So let us
say to conservative Democrats and independents: ``Don't cancel out
your vote for George Bush by voting for a senator or representative
who will go along with the liberal leadership of the Democratic
Party and fight all the good the new president will try to do.''

<TEXT>
   But even beyond that, my fellow conservatives, beyond
identifying our sharp differences on the issues and exposing the
opposition's attempt to hide its liberalism, there is something
else we have to do. As time has gone by, the memory of the economic
and foreign policy nightmares that we faced when we took office has
faded. And so we have to remind the American people of the record _
of how far we have come.
   Now, you can be sure the opposition party isn't going to help us
here. They're even trying to pretend those economic and foreign
policy nightmares they gave us never happened. One political
commentator noticed this at their recent convention and, believe
me, I just don't think I can improve on this paragraph. Let me read
to you what Mark Helprin said. And remember, this is from him now _
not me _ because you know, I might be accused of being biased.
(Laughter.) ``After eight years of Ronald Reagan, a dozen new or
incipient democracies in South America, the Philippines, and South
Korea, after Russian or proxy withdrawal in process in Afghanistan,
Angola and Cambodia, the winding down of the Iran-Iraq war,
half-a-dozen treaties and summits with a marvelously chastened
Soviet Union, after the longest peacetime economic expansion in
American history, record employment and a two-point drop in the
unemployment rate, a significant drop in the crime rate, a 12-point
drop in the prime rate, and a 10-point drop in the rate of
inflation, not to mention tax reform and an economy that has
succeeded in making the stock market crash almost inconsequential,
the Democrats trotted out Jimmy Carter to say, `I told you so,' _
end quote. And you know something, when I saw that happen in
Atlanta, forgive me, but I couldn't help but think, `There he goes
again.'''
   And, you know, we didn't just see at that convention the desire
to forget about the record of chaos their policies gave America in
the seventies. We also heard them openly saying they're going to
steal our words and slogans _ words like ``community,'' ``family,''
``values.'' And even more amazing, after eight years of prophesying
gloom and predicting doom every night on the evening news, they now
want to be _ and are you ready for this _ optimistic and hopeful.
   You know, that reminds me of a little story. It's about Mark
Twain. One dark day Mark Twain went through shirt after shirt after
shirt and just couldn't get one with all the buttons on it. And
finally, losing his patience, he flew into a rage and then used a
string of some very choice words. And then, as the story is told,
when he was through, he turned and was startled to see his wife
standing in the doorway. Carefully, slowly and without a trace of
emotion, she repeated every naughty word just uttered by her
husband. That took several minutes. And when she was through, she
stood impassive in silence, hoping her display would shame Twain.
Instead, there was a twinkle in his eye. He said, ``My dear, you
have the words. You don't have the music.''
   Well, that's true about the so-called leaders of the other
party. They can try and adopt our words, but as long as we
Republicans get out there and give the American people the music,
there isn't a chance they'll get away with it.
   So that's the job ahead of us. And you tell me, when the
liberals try to tell the American people they won't raise taxes but
fail to mention the new spending programs they've promised every
liberal special interest group in Washington, are we going to stand
by and let them get away with it? _ (Crowd yells, ``No.'')
   When the liberal leadership tries to portray themselves as the
newly ordained champions of law and order but forgets to mention
they've given a virtual veto power over the Supreme Court
appointments to fellow liberals like the Civil Liberties Union _
(crowd boos) _ I'm with you _ are we going to stand by and let them
get away with it? _ (crowd yells, ``No.'')
   When the liberal leadership tries to tell the American people
that they're the party of peace but forgets to admit they
jeopardized the chance for peace and tried to tie my hands in arms
negotiations by favoring a nuclear freeze, cutting defense, and
gutting SDI, are we going to let them get away with it? _ (Crowd
yells, ``No.'')
   I thought you might object. You know, when they start using our
words and slogans and then try to tell us that's how they're going
to make the American people vote for them in November, it reminds
me of that little kid at school who the day after getting his
reports card went back to school and said, ``Teacher, I thought
somebody should warn you, my dad says that unless my math grades go
up, somebody's going to get a whipping. You know what? They're
right about one thing. The American people, just like that young
fellow's dad, really are in a mood to settle some important
questions this November. And it won't be President Bush and a new
Republican Congress, but those liberals from the other party that
the American people take out behind the barn.
   So, ladies and gentlemen, we have to get our word out about our
own great record. But one other thing, too. Nobody votes for you
just to say thank you. Americans can be appreciative about the past
but, believe me, Americans vote for a vision of the future.

<HEAD>NEW ORLEANS: the future.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   So we must talk to America about her future. We conservatives
must go to the American people and tell them: Even 68 months of
economic growth and 17-and-a-half million new jobs isn't good
enough for us. We want more _ more growth, more opportunity, more
jobs. (Crowd chants, ``More.'') Right.
   And we intend to ensure this kind of economic prosperity right
through the '90s and into the next century by guaranteeing the
federal government can never again spend and tax the American
people into another economic nightmare. We'll do it by passing the
line-item veto, the balanced-budget amendment and limits on
congressional taxing power.
   So too, we never want to see the day when the Supreme Court is
more interested in criminal rights than in the rights of the victim
and of society itself. You know, the next president may have the
opportunity to appoint three and possibly four new justices shortly
after taking office. We want to tell the American people what it
will mean for their future if it's George Bush making those
appointments.
   And finally, finally, there is this one last issue _ Yes, more
important than even all the other crucial matters I've discussed
with you today. Ladies and gentlemen, when we were together in
Detroit in 1980 and Dallas in 1984, I wonder how many of us could
really have believed then that so many of our fondest hopes and
dreams for America would come true. And of all those things that
have happened, how many of us could have imagined eight or even
four years ago that one day I would have the opportunity to stand
as I did a few months ago there in the Lenin Hills _ at a podium at
Moscow State University _ and tell the young people of Russia about
the wonder and glory of human freedom.
   And here is the _ here is the _ crux, the heart of the matter.
With the beginnings of change we've seen in the Eastern Bloc, and
with the developments of concepts like SDI that destroy weapons,
not people, it is just possible, just possible that we have a
chance now to end the two great nightmares of this century and give
our children a future free of both totalitarianism and nuclear
terror.
   My fellow Republicans, we have proved that what works in foreign
policy is exactly the opposite of the policies of our opposition.
We have demonstrated time and again that plain talk, a strong
defense, and tough diplomacy, bring peace.
   What a great moment we have before us and, oh, how future
generations will dishonor us if, now, in a moment of sudden folly,
we throw it all away. And this is what is now at stake. We must
hold to this moment of hope _ and I tell you with every ounce of
energy and every fiber of my being, only electing George Bush
president of the United States can accomplish that.
   So, so let us go forth this week, to tell the American people
what's really at stake: The fate of generations to come, the hopes
of peace and freedom for our children, for all the children of the
world.
   Don't let anyone tell you this is just another campaign. Don't
let anyone tell you that we're just good administrators out to
renew our management contract. Instead, remember this: This isn't a
campaign, it's a crusade, a crusade for America's future. And this
too: We aren't just good conservative managers, we are the keepers
of the flame, the protectors of the dream _ the American dream that
someday freedom will be the blessing and the birthright of every
people in every nation across God's greening Earth.
   This is a dream worth protecting and one, believe me, that needs
protecting. Protection from those who would squander it away with
special interest spending, for those who would tax the American
people into servitude, those who would make leniency not justice
the hallmark of our courtrooms, and those who would risk a Soviet
base camp in Central America, those who would cut defense or end
SDI or return us to weakness and accommodation abroad.
   No, my fellow Republicans, this is not the future our fellow
Americans want.
   So, let us go to the American people. Let us tell them of our
vision, of the future we offer. A future of economic growth and
opportunity and democratic revolution and peace among nations. And
let us remind them too of America's destiny, of our great calling
as a people.
   And let us take them to a place where they can see with us that
hilltop just now being glimpsed through the dark but dispersing
clouds of 20th century tragedy, let us help them look from there
upon that shining city we have seen and labored for and loved so
long, a city aglow with the light of human freedom, a light that
someday will cast its glow on every dark corner of the world and on
every age and generation to come.
   My fellow Republicans, America needs the strength, the vision
and the true grit of George Bush. And almost, and after almost
half-a-century of Democratic Congresses, America needs a Republican
Congress. And you and I are going to give her both. Let's do this
for America.
   Thank you, and God bless you all.

<HEAD>Artist Who Went From Graffiti to Museums</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jean Michel Basquiat, a one-time graffiti artist
whose paintings are displayed in the Museum of Modern Art and have
sold for tens of thousands of dollars, has died at age 27.
   The Brooklyn-born Basquiat died Friday of either a heart attack
or a drug overdose, according to his agent, Vrej Baghoomian.
   Basquiat's paintings were exhibited in galleries in New York,
Paris and Tokyo, and sold for $25,000 to $50,000, Baghoomian said.
   His paintings, featuring angular figures, symbols and words, are
included in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the
Whitney Museum of American Art.
   Basquiat had no formal training and started his career scrawling
graffiti on buildings with a friend, Al Diaz. The two signed their
work Samo, followed by a copyright symbol.
   He was a close friend of Andy Warhol's and the two collaborated
on a series of works in 1985 that featured cartoon characters and
corporate logos.
   Basquiat is survived by his father, Gerard, and his mother,
Matilde, and two sisters.

<HEAD>Study: Lowering Expectations Of Help From Alcohol Helps Deter
Drinking</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   College students reduced their drinking more if
their assumptions about alcohol's benefits were challenged than if
they were warned about its dangers, psychologists say.
   ``We're looking at this as an approach to prevention'' of
problem drinking, said researcher Renelle Massey of the University
of South Florida at Tampa.
   Study results support a theory that one reason people drink is
because they think it will make them funny, brave, more sociable,
sexier, more assertive or better in some other way, she said.
   Levels of such ``expectancies'' have been linked to alcohol
consumption in previous studies, she said in an interview Sunday at
the American Psychological Association's annual meeting.
   Her study, done with Mark Goldman of the university, included
female college students who said they drank moderately.
   After the students recorded their normal alcohol consumption for
three weeks, 25 were assigned to a program to lower their alcohol
expectancies, 25 others to a more traditional program that focused
on dangers of excessive drinking, and 27 to receive no training at
all.
   For one activity in the expectancies program, students of legal
age were given either an alcoholic beverage or a placebo, but they
were not told which. Afterward, the group played charades.
   Then, those students and the under-age members of the group were
asked to guess who had gotten alcohol, on the basis of their
performance.
   ``Everybody made mistakes,'' Massey said.
   Their inaccuracy led to a discussion of how people have been led
to believe through television, advertising and everyday
conversation that alcohol can make people sexy, funny and so on.
   Participants also were asked to look for songs, advertisements
and other places ``where they may be told alcohol is going to do
good things for you,'' she said.
   The impact on their drinking habits a month after the program
shows that examining expectancies and demonstrating how misleading
they are ``is a lot more potent than just telling people about the
potential hazards of excessive drinking,'' Massey said.
   To analyze the effect of the experimental and traditional
programs, researchers divided the students into 36 low-level and 41
high-level drinkers, depending on whether they had drunk fewer or
more than eight drinks per week before the training.
   The expectancies training made both groups cut back
significantly. High-level drinkers went from an average of 9.7
drinks a week to 6.1, while low-level students dropped from 5.5
drinks to four.
   In contrast, the traditional program affected only the low-level
drinkers significantly, reducing their consumption from 6.4 to
three drinks a week. High-level drinkers changed only from 10.9
drinks to 9.4 drinks weekly.
   Future programs may be able to target particular expectancies
and provide an alternative to alcohol, Massey said. For example,
people who think alcohol would make them more social could be
taught social skills, like how to meet people, she said.
   Peter Finn, assistant professor of psychology at Indiana
University and an alcohol researcher, said Massey's experiment was
well done and the results make sense.
   But such research must look at changes in other expectancies
besides just positive ones, he said.
   People also hold notions that alcohol can be bad for their
health and their self-control, and those ideas also play a role in
how much people drink and whether drinking becomes a problem, he
said.

<HEAD>French Quarter Has More Than ``Strong Drink At Conservative
Prices''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY SHULINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Authentic Democratic Voodoo Dolls'' sold
for $2.98 and Ryan's Irish Pub poured Republican cocktails _
``strong drink at conservative prices; Busch on tap.''
   New Orleans costumed itself in GOP finery for conventioneers
wandering its sultry streets. It stuffed its shop windows with
elephants and its visitors with oysters. And, like a Mardi Gras
reveler, it kept a part of itself under wraps.
   ``I think they might've put some of the bums in jail,'' said
Kathy Hastings, a waitress at the Original Old Absinthe House on
Bourbon Street, where the likes of Mark Twain and Andrew Jackson
once bellied up to the bar. ``I haven't seen the usual prostitutes,
either.''
   Off St. Charles Avenue, the heaps of trash longtime resident
Gary Esolen described as ``an urban horror'' had disappeared. More
dramatic, to French Quarter gallery owner Joseph Sutton, was a
transformed railroad overpass between the airport and downtown New
Orleans.
   ``For 364 days a year, it's got the most disgusting graffiti
you've ever seen,'' Sutton said. ``Now, they have it painted pastel
colors _ peach, lavender and aqua. Suddenly, it is to die! It's
under 24-hour guard to make sure it stays that way.''
   ``The city has never looked better,'' added Sutton, who'd even
heard that mint was being dumped into city sewer lines to further
sweeten things up for the visitors. ``I don't know if it's true.
But it does show the extent to which we feel the eyes of the world
on New Orleans.''
   On Bourbon Street, the carousing capital of the city, waitress
Hastings thought the party was getting off to a slow start. She'd
been looking forward to the Republicans' arrival for weeks. Now
that they're here, ``they're turning out to be cheap.''
   Taxi driver Bob Kendall, on the other hand, had hung a stuffed
elephant from his rear view mirror in tribute to some ``excellent''
tipping.
   And Sutton, a ``Kennedy Democrat,'' was keeping his bases
covered, with a $6,800 gold and ivory elephant prominently
displayed in the front window of his shop.
   It was there, in the heart of the French Quarter, that the
Republicans congregated, sampling the rich gumbo of cultures:
French, Spanish, Caribbean, Italian. They took in the jazz
musicians, the voodoo dolls, and the crabs.
   But Esolen says the more subtle qualities of the quarter must be
appreciated.
   ``As you wander the streets, there's a sense of scale that is
such that a human being is welcome,'' said Esolen. ``You can
imagine yourself in every nook and cranny, in the light of a
balcony window, the glimpse of a patio.
   ``At the same time, much of its architecture looks inward. The
French Quarter is a place of secrets.''

<HEAD>Bio: Lennon Kicked Heroin Habit By `Floating'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Lennon kicked a heroin habit with the help
of a sensory-deprivation tank and felt as healthy as he'd ever felt
in the weeks before his murder, according to a new biography.
   Lennon kicked the debilitating habit in 1979 with
self-discipline and a cedarwood box filled with a warm saline
solution in which he would float for up to half an hour in the
dark, Albert Goldman writes in ``The Lives Of John Lennon.''
   The sensation reminded him of getting high, according to the
excerpts of the book published in this week's People magazine.
   In November 1980, following the release of his and Yoko Ono's
album, ``Double Fantasy,'' he called producer Jack Douglas.
   ``John was totally satisfied with himself mentally and
physically,'' Douglas said. ``He was starting to make a break. It
had to do with his 40th birthday. He told me: `I'm happy to be 40
years old. I'm in the best shape I've ever been in my life and I
feel the best I ever felt.'''
   The book says Yoko experienced hallucinations and threatened
suicide, but kicked her heroin habit with the help of a physician.
Once off the drug, and encouraged by a friend, according to
Goldman, she wrote most of the songs for ``Double Fantasy'' and
``Milk and Honey'' in a week.

<DATELINE>IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There are no rats, empty crack vials or
gang members outside at Elyse Sanchez' apartment, but the former
New York welfare mother who's on a graduate fellowship at the
University of Iowa still locks her door.
   Ms. Sanchez, who is working on her Ph.D. and has her sights on a
career in academia, jokes about her new suburban life here.
   ``I have to contend with a whole new set of problems, like
getting grass stains out of my laundry,'' said Ms. Sanchez, 35.
   But three years ago, while living in the Bronx in a rat-infested
apartment building frequented by drug users and gangs members, her
problems were much bigger.
   Her husband left, leaving her to raise their four children on
$950 a month in welfare payments and food stamps.
   Ms. Sanchez, who dropped out of New York's Hunter College after
one year when she was 17, decided on an impulse to return to
college.
   She enrolled at Lehman College, relying on her oldest daughter,
Rochelle, now 17, to watch the three other children while she took
classes and studied at night.
   ``It was horrible. It was terrifying for me to leave them in
that apartment,'' she said. ``There were leaks from the ceiling,
the second bathroom had collapsed. We had the usual assortment of
rats, mice and roaches.
   ``It was just ugly and dirty and horrible,'' Mrs. Sanchez said
in her living room in Iowa City strewn with boxes of unpacked
books. ``All the time it was just fear, shaking fear.''
   Her other children _ Damian, 11, Hope, 10, and Kim, 9 _ were
kept indoors while she went to classes.
   ``They looked imprisoned, pale and sickly,'' Ms. Sanchez said.
``I, at least, had the advantage of being in school, having my nose
in a book.''
   At Lehman, she studied English and the humanities in the Adult
Degree Program, carrying up to 52 credits a year.
   She earned straight A's, graduating Phi Beta Kappa in June.
   Her accomplishment attracted national attention, which she found
irritating.
   ``They implied that well, this is it. Poor, Bronx mother on
welfare makes good, end of story. The way I look at it, that was
just the first act,'' she said.
   Fellowship offers for a graduate degree poured in and Ms.
Sanchez knew she didn't want to stay in New York.
   ``Kim would point out these little plastic things she'd see on
the porch and say, `See Mommy, that's a crack vial.' When an
9-year-old knows what a crack vial is, it's time to get out,'' she
said.
   After considering offers ``from most of the schools in the Big
10,'' Ms. Sanchez accepted Iowa's, where she will pursue a Ph.D. in
English literature.
   ``I knew of Iowa's reputation because of its Writers Workshop,
which is world famous,'' she said. ``I've always wanted to be a
creative writer.''
   She still marvels at the direction her life has taken.
   ``I never thought I'd get to graduate school,'' Ms. Sanchez
said. ``It never occurred to me that I could go to graduate school
because I never thought I could support myself and my children.
   ``But people kept encouraging me at Lehman to try out. They said
I was just born to be a teacher.''
   In addition to a $17,000 salary stipend and tuition waiver
included with the teaching fellowship, Iowa agreed to waive the
tuition for Rochelle, who has enrolled as a freshman.
   Despite her achievements, Ms. Sanchez is afraid.
   ``I'm scared here because I was a big fish in a little pond at
Lehman,'' she said. ``I'm a little scared because I want to see
what the competition is going to be like.
   ``What frightens me is not living up to the promise the English
Department sees in me,'' Ms. Sanchez said. ``I want to do well as
much for them as for myself.''

   Striking submarine builders at Electric
Boat could torpedo their futures if they don't acknowledge the
increasing competitive marketplace and tightening military budget,
analysts say.
   Despite a low unemployment rate and shortage of skilled workers,
conditions that should favor the union, defense industry analysts
say Electric Boat holds the upper hand in the 6-week-old strike by
the 10,000-member Metal Trades Council.
   The union struck over Electric Boat's demand that employees
accept lump-sum bonuses instead of wage increases in a three-year
contract.
   The company says it needs to bring down labor costs to become
more competitive with its Virginia rival, Newport News Shipbuilding
and Dry Dock Co. The union said the offer doesn't take into account
Connecticut's higher cost of living.
   In only the second negotiating session since the strike began,
the company Thursday offered bonuses of 5 percent and 4 percent in
the first two years and a 3 percent wage increase in the third
year, in addition to a $600 bonus.
   The union, which said the offer was not even worth putting to a
vote, has asked for wage increases of 5 percent the first year and
4 percent the final two years of the contract.
   The company said that as of Friday, 668 workers had crossed
picket lines. During a five-month strike in 1975, only 150 workers
were reported to have done so.
   Electric Boat's efforts to hire replacement workers, which have
included placing full-page ads in newspapers, have produced meager
results. Only 20 people have signed up, about the number of workers
the sub builder loses each week through attrition.
   Electric Boat could hurt itself more by acceding to the union's
demands and settling quickly than by holding out, despite the low
jobless rate and shortage of skilled workers, analysts say.
   Electric Boat, a division of General Dynamics, has lost six
attack submarine contracts in the last two years to Newport News.
Electric Boat was awarded only one of three this year; Newport News
had bid on only two.
   In all, Electric Boat has contracts for seven Trident subs and
nine attack subs. The company is the only builder of the Trident.
   First-class mechanics, a job classification covering more than
85 percent of Electric Boat's sub builders, earn $12.02 an hour.
The same workers at Newport News earn $1.24 less an hour in wages
and benefits, according to Electric Boat.
   ``The Navy is going to the lowest bidder, and that has
predominantly been Newport News. I don't know what the union
expects the Navy to do,'' said Paul Nisbet, analyst for
Prudential-Bache Securities.
   While Electric Boat is making money on the production of Trident
submarines, it has not been making money on attack subs for some
time, which is ``a further reason for them to hold out longer,''
Nisbet said.
   ``I don't think the union has much bargaining strength,'' said
Gary Reich, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers.
   Also working in the company's favor is the tightening military
budget, said Phil Friedman of Drexel Burnham Lambert.
   Electric Boat has reassigned about 1,800 salaried workers to
jobs performed by strikers. It has also shifted work to yards in
Quonset Point, R.I., where all sub construction begins, and in
Charleston, S.C.
   While certain vendors and small groceries around the shipyard
here have suffered, the heavy tourist trade has kept business brisk
elsewhere, said Audrey Golub, head of the regional Chamber of
Commerce.
   ``No one has said to me yet, `God, the strike is really
hurting.' If the strike continues into the fall and winter then we
would begin to be able to see an impact,'' she said.

   Jesse Jackson says he will break bread
with Cesar Chavez then pick up his fast when the 61-year-old farm
workers union leader resumes eating after nearly a month.
   Chavez' may end his fast this week, Jackson said.
   ``Cesar cannot bear the cross alone. The suffering must be
shared,'' Jackson said Sunday, before a rally of at least 2,700
people at the United Farm Workers compound in Delano, 150 miles
north of Los Angeles.
   ``When (Chavez) comes off the fast, I will pick up the baton and
take another lap,'' Jackson told the crowd. He encouraged others to
fast for two or three days to support the union's 4-year-old
boycott of California table grapes.
   Jackson raised hands with actors Martin Sheen and Robert Blake
amid chants of ``Jesse, Jesse.''
   Chavez was scheduled to attend the rally but didn't because of
his weakened condition. He has lost more than 26 pounds since
beginning his water-only fast on July 17 to protest the use of
pesticides the union says threaten workers, consumers and the
environment.
   The California Table Grape Commission says the boycott has not
affected sales. State officials and grape growers deny that table
grapes contain dangerous pesticide residues.
   Jackson met privately with Chavez in a room at the union's
retirement village before Sunday's rally. An Associated Press
reporter and photographer were allowed to briefly observe their
meeting, but the conversation could not be heard.
   It was the first time Chavez allowed media to see him in the
room where he has been living during the fast. Dressed in light
blue pajamas and lying on a bed, Chavez appeared motionless during
his talk with Jackson. He has refused to talk with reporters.
   Asked at a news conference about Chavez's condition, Jackson
said, ``Whatever he may have lost in physical strength, he has more
than compensated in spiritual strength and in determination.''
   ``Our willingess for decent conditions for workers is an
unending struggle,'' said Jackson. ``We are here today because that
struggle continues.''
   Chavez entered the 30th day of his fast today. His longest fast
was 25 days in 1968. He also fasted 24 days in 1972 to advance
workers' rights issues.
   ``He's getting a little weaker every day,'' said the Rev. Chris
Hartmire who disclosed that Chavez did not attend Mass on Saturday
night, the first evening he has missed Mass since beginning the
fast.
   Doctors reported Saturday that Chavez had depleted his body fat,
and his body was beginning to burn muscle tissue, Hartmire said.

   About 3,600 Republicans went to the zoo to
mix it up with Ellie Mae, the Very Important Pachyderm.
   ``It's a wonderful elephant, obviously Republican,'' said Joan
Milke Flores, a California delegate and Los Angeles city
councilwoman.
   In a city that never stops partying, today's events include a
fete for Republican lawmakers at the Bourbon Street home of a
Democratic congresswoman and a salute to die-hard delegates still
pledged to Pat Robertson for president.
   Ellie Mae, an orphaned African elephant, got gushing attention
at the three-hour Elephant Romp Welcome, a lavish affair for which
corporations contributed $150,000 to foot the bill.
   ``All this attention has kind of spoiled her,'' said handler
James Holston of Ellie Mae. ``She's just a 3-year-old baby _ but
she weighs 1,200 pounds,'' he said.
   Revelers beat steamy heat in four air-conditioned zoo tents,
where they two-stepped to Cajun music and traded quips with Paul
Prudhomme, the popular New Orleans chef.
   ``We'll throw them a helluva party as long as they're paying,''
Prudhomme said as he hacked chunks of butter for chicken etoufee.
   Max Richter, jaunty in rainbow-colored suspenders and a white
cap, twirled his wife, Mel, to encourage others to get on the
wooden-plank dance floors. ``This is a waltz, and we just did a
two-step, easy dances,'' he said.
   Pat O'Brien's, which claims to dispense more alcohol than any
bar in the world, prepared 2,000 potent Hurricanes in 15-ounce
paper cups. The usual dose is 28 ounces and the hardy guzzler keeps
the glass. ``This is the official drink, and we want the GOP to try
it,'' said spokesman Lou Reynolds.
   The mission of the Elephant Romp Welcome was to provide a
three-week dose of New Orleans in three hours, said city Councilman
Mike Early, a Democrat.
   ``A philosophy of this party, I think, would be that in New
Orleans, we believe that throwing a party, hosting a party, really
is an art. It really is a science,'' Early said.
   Rep. Lindy Boggs, D-La., planned to open her 193-year-old French
Quarter home today for GOP senators and members of Congress.
``They're not overrunning my house. They're most cordially
invited,'' she said with a laugh.
   ``I have a great spirit of being partisan for the city of New
Orleans. This is a real lift in spirits and the economy as well,''
Mrs. Boggs said.
   At Sunday's jazz brunches, palates were tickled by seafood and
spicy recipes. But Alaska offered offbeat fare like moose and
reindeer sausage at its $20,000-plus feast.
   Alaska GOP chairman Jim Crawford said he liked his native fare
better than local delights. ``But I don't think there's a better
party town in the United States than New Orleans.''

<TEXT>
   It took a few takes, but a peace activist
got his message across after breaking a 63-day fast with a bite
from a giant pizza topped with a pepperoni peace sign that he then
left for Sylvester Stallone.
   Jerry Rubin took his crusade against cinema violence and war
toys to Stallone's home Saturday. Although he didn't see the star
of the ``Rambo'' movies, the Southern California activist was more
graciously received than in a previous visit to a Stallone
residence. During that trip, he was doused with water.
   On Saturday, Rubin's wife, Marissa, two friends, reporters and
some camera crews watched as he delivered the 3-foot pizza to
Stallone's home and presented the pizza to a housekeeper.
   To accommodate a TV crew that arrived after the presentation,
Rubin got the pizza back from Stallone's housekeepers so he could
re-enact the presentation. At one point the unwieldy pizza slipped
onto the driveway.
   After his first bite in 63 days, Rubin said he was looking
forward ``to watching movies with popcorn again.''
   Rubin said he hadn't stepped on a scale to determine the effects
of his liquid-only fast, but noted he had lost three belt notches.
   Rubin said he had not considered the strategy used by critics of
the new film ``The Last Temptation of Christ,'' who offered to
raise money to buy the film so they could destroy it.
   ``The peace movement couldn't afford that type of thing,'' Rubin
said of Stallone's $63 million blood-and-guts ``Rambo III.''

   Stock prices rose slightly in Tokyo trading Monday,
while the dollar lost some ground.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, the Tokyo Stock
Exchange's main barometer, closed at 27,901.29 points, up 67.78
points or 0.24 percent from last week's close.
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at 132.95 yen,
down 0.10 yen from Friday's close.
   ``Nearly the whole exchange is on vacation and hardly anyone is
selling their shares,'' said a securities dealer at a major
securities firm, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``The slight
gain in the Nikkei reflects the so-so situation in New York last
Friday.''
   Dealers also said investors are reluctant to participate in the
market ahead of the release of a U.S. trade report scheduled to be
announced Tuesday in Washington.

<HEAD>35 Illegal Aliens Found In Boxcar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KINGSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty-five Salvadorans spent five
hours inside a sweltering boxcar with almost no ventilation and
would likely have died had they not been discovered, authorities
said.
   ``It was well over 100 degrees (outside) when we found them,''
U.S. Border Patrol agent Ramiro Gonzalez said of the illegal aliens
found Sunday morning. ``It was probably another 20 to 30 degrees
hotter inside the car.''
   Officials said the aliens could have suffered the same fate as
18 found dead last summer inside a locked boxcar near the west
Texas town of Sierra Blanca, about 65 miles southeast of El Paso.
   ``When we opened the car up, the people were pale and real
sweaty, and then we transported them to the Border Patrol station
in Kingsville and gave them water and we fed them,'' Gonzalez said.
   The 35 were being held Sunday night, along with a Honduran man
and 19 Mexicans who were found outside the locked boxcar, Gonzalez
said.
   The Salvadorans, including two 14-year-old boys, had been locked
inside since boarding the Houston-bound freight train in
Brownsville at 5 a.m.
   Those found inside the boxcar said the door was to have been
kept open to allow ventilation, but someone closed and locked it at
Brownsville, Gonzalez said.
   In July 1987, only one of 19 aliens survived after more than 12
hours inside a boxcar where the temperature reached 130 degrees.
   Authorities said the aliens had been locked inside the car by a
smuggler who tossed in railroad spikes for the aliens to chip
through the airtight car's heavy wooden floor.
   On March 21, Border Patrol agents pulled 46 dehydrated aliens
from a sealed boxcar during a sweep of northbound traffic 6 miles
north of Harlingen.
   On Sunday, Border Patrol agents stationed at Harlingen reported
the aliens aboard the train, said Cruz McGuire of the Border Patrol
in Kingsville.
   ``We followed the train from Sarita to Kingsville and saw a
number of the aliens riding on gondolas and some riding on grain
hoppers,'' McGuire said.
   Officials checked the train boxcar by boxcar when it arrived at
the Kingsville freight yard. The aliens were discovered by an agent
who heard voices inside a car with fiberglass insulation, Gonzalez
said.
   The aliens told authorities a man in Brownsville offered to get
them to Houston for $300 to $600, Gonzalez said.
   Officials said the aliens did not know the smuggler's name.
   Some of the aliens told the agents they had contacted relatives
who had sent them money for transportation to California.

<HEAD>Government Newspaper Condemns Ultra-Nationalist Group</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In one of the harshest official condemnations to
date of a Russian ultra-nationalist group, an editorial in Izvestia
accused Pamyat of fomenting ethnic strife and demanded a crackdown
on its Leningrad chapter.
   Pamyat, which has branches in many Soviet cities, has been
holding outdoor rallies every Thursday in Leningrad, and official
and unofficial sources say local authorities have done little to
stop them.
   The editorial in Saturday's editions of the government newspaper
called for a crackdown on Pamyat, saying it opposes Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's wide-ranging reform program.
   The paper also published a quarter-page letter under the
headline ``Unclean Play on Clean Feelings,'' from a group of
Leningrad scholars who called Pamyat ``a deadly threat to our
future.''
   This month, the weekly Moscow News published letters from
Soviets blasting Pamyat as racist and fascist. One quoted a speaker
at a July 7 rally as demanding deportation of Jews and other
``alien races.''
   The Izvestia editorial and letter took the condemnation one step
further, calling for a legal crackdown against Pamyat in Leningrad.
   In the letter, 59 staff members of the Leningrad branch of the
Institute of Oriental Studies appealed to the country's prosecutor
to break up the group because it violates an article of the Soviet
Constitution forbidding propaganda of ethnic and racist strife.
   ``Pamyat distorts the history of our country,'' the scholars
wrote. ``It often uses people's lack of information in matters of
history, and speculates on their natural and nobel feeling of love
of their homeland and on their wish to make a contribution to the
restoration of monuments of Russian culture and to nature
conservation.''
   The scholars said the group advocates militant nationalism and
anti-Semitism.
   The Izvestia editorial noted that Pamyat often complains about a
``Jewish predominance in Soviet science and culture'' to provoke
people.
   The result, the editors said, is damage to Gorbachev's program
of perestroika. The Soviet leader's restructuring program embraces
social, economic and cultural reforms.
   ``Pamyat is trying to separate out people's national
differences, to sow the seed of destructive hostility, and has come
to be directed against and working against perestroika,'' the
newspaper said.
   The scholars, in their letter, complained that Communist Party
and government authorities in Leningrad and the local press had
taken a passive attitude toward the group.
   The editors of Izvestia, a centrally controlled newspaper,
apparently felt they had to step in, saying they had received many
letters protesting Pamyat's activities in Leningrad.
   The editors quoted government officials in Leningrad as saying
party officials pressured them into granting Pamyat permission to
hold the rallies but that the order was reversed on Wednesday.
   Izvestia said Pamyat ignored the ban and held a rally the next
day.
   Abraham Demin, a Jewish activist in Leningrad who opposes
Pamyat, told The Associated Press that police detained and beat him
after he showed up at the rally. Earlier last week, another
Leningrad dissident was arrested for trying to unfurl anti-Pamyat
posters at an Aug. 4 Pamyat rally.

<HEAD>Doctor Says Black Leader's Condition `Very Satisfactory'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela, the imprisoned
African National Congress leader, is responding well to treatment
for a lung ailment and his condition is ``very satisfactory,'' a
doctor said today.
   Dr. J.G.L. Strauss, medical superintendent at Tygerberg
Hospital, said Mandela's left lung was inflamed, but that there was
no evidence of malignancy.
   He said that unless there was a change in condition, no further
bulletins would be issued on Mandela, 70, who was transferred from
Pollsmoor Prison to the hospital on Friday.
   Strauss said Mandela's windpipe and lung area had been examined,
and doctors had performed a biopsy and drainage operation.
   Mandela's wife, Winnie, and youngest daughter, Zindzi, flew from
Johannesburg to see him Saturday, and returned without making any
public comment.
   Mandela, who has been in prison since 1962, is serving a life
term for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the white-led
government.
   He is widely considered the paramount leader of South Africa's
black majority, and his hospitalization has prompted anti-apartheid
groups to renew calls for his release.
   On Sunday, Health Minister Willie van Niekerk said Mandela was
receiving the best possible treatment and described Tygerberg's
lung unit as comparable to the world's best.

<HEAD>Massachusetts Republicans Hope to Provide `Truth' About Dukakis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts delegates to the Republican
National Convention hope to offer GOP counterparts from around the
country an inside glimpse of their longtime nemesis, Michael
Dukakis.
   The 52-delegate group will act as a ``truth squad of sorts'' at
the convention, which opens today, said Andrew Card, a former White
House aide and state representative who has rejoined the Bush
campaign.
   ``The people from Massachusetts know Mike Dukakis best, and they
will help call attention to the `Massachusetts Mirage' and help to
describe who Mike Dukakis really is,'' Card said.
   Dukakis has been the chief target of state Republicans since he
won his first gubernatorial race in 1974. He is in his 10th year as
governor, losing a re-election bid in 1978 and returning to office
in 1983.
   Joseph Malone, a delegate who is running against Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., said he has talked to Georgia Republicans ``who
lament the fact that they never really got the message out about
how bad Jimmy Carter would be for America. We don't want to repeat
that mistake.''

<HEAD>Connecticut Delegates Urged To Preach Virtues Of Moderation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some Connecticut Republicans are uneasy with
a homestate congresswoman's suggestion that they promote the
state's brand of moderate Republicanism during this week's national
convention.
   Rep. Nancy Johnson on Sunday told the Connecticut delegation
that more moderate party policies are needed to broaden the party's
appeal.
   ``I don't think it's appropriate,'' said delegate Richard C.
Bozzuto. ``We've determined the candidate, the decision from this
point on is much the candidate's choice.''
   State Rep. Richard Foley of Oxford said Connecticut delegates
shouldn't be preaching to their generally more conservative
counterparts from elsewhere in the country.
   ``Folks in Connecticut ... have a hard time figuring out what's
going on in Oklahoma and New Mexico and California,'' Foley said.
   Mrs. Johnson, a member of the convention's Platform Committee,
on Sunday said some elements of the platform, including its strong
anti-abortion language, are ``constraining, alienating and will
prevent this party in the future from becoming the majority party
if we cannot find a way to speak more broadly to more elements in
the American population.''
   She urged Connecticut delegates to take that message to members
of other state delegations this week.

   George Bush's ties to both New England and
Texas have often been noted, but now fans in the Buckeye state are
calling attention to an Ohio connection.
   Tahlman Krumm Jr., an assistant to Bush's Ohio campaign
chairman, said Sunday the vice president has ``a lot of roots in
Ohio.''
   Bush's father and grandfather both lived in Columbus, where his
father founded the Buckeye Steel Castings Co., and his wife,
Barbara, also has Buckeye connections.
   Her mother was a native of Marysville, and her grandfather was
once a justice on the Ohio Supreme Court, Krumm said.
   The vice president may not adopt Ohio, as he has Texas and some
New England states ``but he has a lot of kith and kin there,''
Krumm said.
   Krumm was tracing Bush's Ohio roots after Sunday's announcement
that Bush will be in Ohio next weekend.

the folks converging on New Orleans this week.
   While many were attracting to the nightlife on Bourbon Street,
the riverfront area, historic Jackson Square and toney shops,
Robert McKay of Vassar, Mich. wanted to see ``the motel where Jimmy
Swaggart got caught.''
   ``The Republican convention ought to make it a national shrine
because that scandal knocked Pat Robertson out of contention
forever,'' he said.
   Swaggart, a television evangelist, was caught visiting a
prostitute in a New Orleans motel. Many other evangelists said they
suffered a loss of credibility _ and decline in contributions _
because of the scandal.

<HEAD>Zumwalt: Son's Death Pushes Him To Fight Harder For Compensation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elmo R. Zumwalt III, who died of
cancer two decades after his father ordered use of Agent Orange in
Vietnam, once swam through water doused with the defoliant to
collect weapons from Viet Cong boats.
   He won over his crew, but that swim may have marked the
beginning of his last battle, with the cancer that ended his life
Saturday at age 42.
   Retired Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., the American naval commander
in Vietnam who ordered the spraying of the defoliant then thought
to be harmless, said his son's death will only push him to work
harder to force the government to compensate veterans who suffered
from Agent Orange's effects.
   ``There are still many hundreds of veterans who do need help,''
Zumwalt said the day his son died. ``I believe very strongly now
that the evidence is clear that the Agent Orange is responsible for
the problems many veterans are having.''
   His son was diagnosed in 1983 as having non-Hodgkins lymphoma.
Two years later, doctors found he had lymphoma Hodgkins disease.
   His son, Elmo Russell Zumwalt IV, suffers from a congenital
dysfunction that confuses his physical senses.
   The Zumwalts chronicled their battle with cancer in 1986 with
the book, ``My Father, My Son,'' which they wrote with author John
Pekkanen. The book was made into a television movie in May.
   Zumwalt said his son was strong until the end, even joking and
teasing with relatives during Friday evening. He died in his sleep
Saturday morning.
   ``I do not second guess the decisions Dad made in Vietnam, nor
do I doubt for a minute that the saving of human life was always
his first priority in his conduct of the war,'' the younger Zumwalt
once said. ``I have the greatest love and admiration for him as a
man, and the deepest respect for him as a military leader.''
   Zumwalt was commanding a swift boat along the rivers of the Ca
Mau Peninsula when his father, the youngest man ever to serve as
chief of naval operations, ordered the spraying of Agent Orange to
save servicemen from being killed by enemy ambushes along the
waterways.
   Before the spraying, U.S. forces had a 6 percent casualty rate
each month. Afterward, that figure dropped to less than 1 percent.
   Since the war, the elder Zumwalt and his son had pushed for
government assistance to veterans affected by Agent Orange.
   On June 30, the U.S. Supreme Court removed the last legal
obstacle to a $180 million settlement between Vietnam veterans and
the manufacturers of Agent Orange. The justices let stand rulings
that dismissed lawsuits by about 300 veterans who had challenged a
1984 settlement.

   A 9-year-old boy and his aunt drowned in
the Lehigh River as family members watched in horror after the two
were swept away while wading across a shallow area below a dam,
authorities say.
   Emisilda Santana, 41, and her nephew Lizandro Santiago were
pronounced dead of accidental drowning Sunday despite efforts by
rescuers who pulled the victims from the water and administered
emergency aid on the shore.
   The woman's husband, Jose Santiago, and the boy's mother, Maria
Pacheco, both of Allentown, were comforted by friends at the scene.
   The victims were among a group of six who were walking through
the rapids ``when the water came and took us,'' said Esperanca
Santiago, 10, a cousin of Santiago and Mrs. Santana's niece.
   Esperanca's brother, sister and another cousin also were in the
group, she said, but all survivors escaped injuries. One child was
hanging piggy-back on Mrs. Santana as the group struggled to shore,
Esperanca said.
   She said Lizandro could not swim and had to be pulled from a
public swimming pool earlier this year.
   Robert Dougher, 41, of Bethlehem, a Conrail policeman, said he
was nearby when children came running from the wooded bank crying
for help.
   He ran down to the river and saw Mrs. Santiago floating face
down near the shore.
   Dougher said he pulled her ashore and gave her mouth-to-mouth
and cardiopulmonary resuscitation but ``I couldn't get any vitals.''
   Other rescuers arrived and tried to resuscitate the woman while
two police officers tied to ropes searched for the boy in the
5-to-6-foot deep water.
   Two fishermen in a boat downstream found the boy in about 6 to 8
feet of water.
   The victims were taken to two different hospitals, where they
were pronounced dead.

   Emperor Hirohito said today at a ceremony marking
the 43rd anniversary of the end of World War II that ``it still
hurts my heart'' to think of those who died in battle and their
families.
   He also praised Japan's development and expansion since the end
of the war.
   Hirohito, 87, the only surviving leader of the major
participating countries in the war, walked slowly at the public
hall outside the Imperial Palace in central Tokyo.
   The moment of silence traditionally held at noon sharp was
delayed briefly while he shuffled to the microphone. However, he
walked without assistance and spoke in a firm voice.
   ``Today, on the day to honor the war dead and pray for peace, I
think of those who died in battle in the last war and their
bereaved families, and it still hurts my heart,'' he said.
   ``Time flies fast, and in the 43 years since the end of the war,
the country has developed due to people's efforts,'' he said.
   The emperor underwent surgery last year so doctors could perform
a bypass around a growth in his pancreas. Since then, his public
appearances have been limited.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, who also attended the ceremony,
said it is Japan's duty to help maintain peace and not let war
recur.
   The ceremony, held on the 43rd anniversary of the day Japan
surrendered, was attended by about 7,000 people, including members
of the Cabinet.
   Meanwhile, thousands of Japanese went to the Yasukuni Shrine,
dedicated to the Japanese war dead. Among them were many
politicians and several members of the Cabinet.
   However, Takeshita decided not to go, following a policy set by
his predecessor, Yasuhiro Nakasone.
   Among the 2.4 million Japanese war dead enshrined there are 14
Class A _ or major _ war criminals, including wartime Prime
Minister Hideki Tojo.

   Hundreds of youths barged into a music concert
without paying and went on to loot shops, rob bus and subway
passengers and shower riot police with rocks and bottles, police
said.
   Nine people were arrested and one subway passenger was taken to
the hospital with facial cuts, but no serious injuries were
reported in the Sunday night melee in west London, police said.
   Scotland Yard spokesman Mike Cobb said about 300 youths forced
down a perimeter fence and barged into a soul music concert at a
park in Shepherd's Bush without paying the $11 entrance fee.
   Organizers ended the 8-hour concert 1{ hours early at 8:30 p.m.
and the 300 people who paid to attend the concert left peacefully,
Cobb said.
   But the same group that barged into the concert spilled into the
streets, ransacking and looting shops in the area and mugging some
passers-by, he said.
   Acting Chief Inspector Jim McFarlane of the British Transport
Police said that at about 9 p.m. about 200 of the youths boarded a
Central Line subway at White City ``and systemically went through
the train, through the connecting doors, robbing people on their
way.''
   He said 14 people reported being robbed and one passenger
suffered facial cuts, McFarlane said.
   Scotland Yard said about 20 youths armed with knives and chains
jumped onto a bus, assaulted the driver and robbed passengers of
cash and jewelry.
   Youths hurled rocks and bottles at riot police during the
disturbances, which lasted nearly two hours, police said.

   A riot at the overcrowded 144-year-old
jail here left eight people injured and much of the institution
destroyed, while three prisoners escaped during a revolt at a
prison 15 miles away, authorities said.
   Two of the escapees were at large today.
   Inmates at the Essex County Jail and House of Correction,
aggravated by Sunday's heat and upset about overcrowding and food
quality, twice set fire to the granite jail. The second blaze
destroyed an entire wing containing 36 cells, about a quarter of
the prison.
   About 500 people, many relatives and friends of inmates, watched
the disturbances.
   ``They chanted `Feed us!' `Give us food'!'' said Barbara Martin,
45, who had come to visit her inmate husband. ``The conditions in
there are deplorable. It stinks.''
   Nearly 200 of the 250 inmates were relocated to other prisons
around the state, said jail Superintendent William Mageary.
   Late Sunday, inmates at the Billerica House of Correction set
fire to a work shed and three inmates escaped after a scuffle with
a guard. One was recaptured quickly. Three inmates and at least two
guards sustained minor injuries, said Middlesex County Sheriff John
McGonigle.
   Billerica was one of the prisons where inmates from Lawrence
were to be transfered, but those plans were dropped because of the
disturbance there.
   In Lawrence, a group of inmates set the first fire at about noon
on a wooden floor in the East Wing. The more serious fire broke out
in the same wing about an hour later and raged for 1{ hours.
   Prisoners pelted firefighters and police with debris as flames
poured through the roof during the three-hour uprising.
   No escapes were reported, but two inmates were caught attempting
to slip out, said Essex County Sheriff Charles Reardon.
   ``Cops got hit, firefighters got hit,'' Lawrence fire Lt. James
Campbell said. ``They threw pipes _ long pipes, I don't know where
they got them from _ bricks, bottles.''
   When it was over, at least eight people, including five inmates,
were treated at hospitals for minor injuries or smoke inhalation,
officials said.
   The melee drew about 150 state and local police and riot squads,
plus 100 firefighters.
   The immediate cause of the uprising wasn't known, Reardon said.
But he said the prison was filled to twice its capacity of 127
prisoners.
   The Lawrence house of correction holds inmates convicted of
misdemeanors with maximum terms of up to 2{ years, officials said.
It also serves as a jail for persons awaiting trial.
   State correction Commissioner Michael Fair said the fire
``certainly puts a tremendous strain on an already overcrowded
system.''
   However, plans already were under way for a new Essex County
House of Correction in Middleton to replace the Lawrence prison,
according to state Human Services Secretary Philip Johnston. The
prison, in the design stage, is expected to cost $30 million to $40
million.
   Fair said it would be difficult to find room in the state system
to relocate the scores of prisoners displaced by the Lawrence fire.
   ``I don't have any room,'' Fair said. ``This is a major loss.''

   More than 1,200 refugees were allowed
to return home from Honduras after 15 U.S. church workers
accompanying them agreed to stay behind, ending a daylong impasse,
a United Nations official said.
   The government, which claims many refugees living in Honduras
back leftist Salvadoran guerrillas, had accused the church workers
of exploiting the returning refugees for political ends.
   The refugees and more than 150 vehicles, held on the Honduran
side of the border since Saturday night, were allowed to cross the
border Sunday evening, said Roberto Rodriquez of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees.
   The church workers ``were conscious that by not coming they
would create no type of problems'' for the returning Salvadorans,
he said by telephone.
   Rodriguez said the refugees from El Salvador's nearly 9-year-old
civil war were on their way to hometowns in northern Chalatenango
province, which they left in the early 1980s.
   In the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, a foreign ministry
spokesman said the refugees were being escorted by officials from
the U.N. agency.
   There was no immediate comment from the government and the
church workers could not be reached.
   The Salvadorans lived in the Mesa Grande refugee camp 30 miles
north of the border before leaving under an arrangement between the
refugees, the Salvadoran government and the U.N. group, which is
overseeing the repatriation.
   Their convoy of 36 buses and 116 trucks was halted in Honduras
about 500 yards from the border late Saturday. Salvadoran
authorities refused to permit 15 U.S. church workers of the Going
Home organization to accompany them.
   Interior Minister Edgar Belloso Funes told reporters at the
border Sunday his government ``welcomes with open arms'' the
refugees.
   ``But the so-called internationalists among them are using our
brothers for strictly political ends. They (the foreigners) are
coming here to break our laws, and I have orders from the highest
level that they not be permitted entry,'' he said.
   Amadeo Lopez, a returning refugee and member of the community's
directorate, said earlier Sunday that the group of 1,230 refugees
was insisting the U.S. church workers be allowed to enter.
   Jose Maria Mendiluce, the U.N. group's Central American
director, said the presence of the church workers was not
contemplated in the accord.
   Louis Vitale, a Roman Catholic priest from Oakland, Calif., and
spokesman for the Going Home delegation, blamed the government for
the standoff.
   ``This is part of the Salvadoran government's continuing efforts
to obstruct the refugees' return,'' he said, adding that all
members of his delegation had visas for El Salvador.
   Going Home is an interfaith organization supporting Salvadoran
refugees.
   The armed forces consider the three Salvadoran refugee camps in
Honduras part of the rear guard of leftist guerrillas that have
fought the U.S.-supported government. About 4,300 refugees returned
last year and about 15,000 Salvadoran refugees remain in the camps.
   The majority of the 65,000 people killed in the war have been
civilians.
   Human rights groups blame security forces and rightist death
squads for most of the political murders in the early 1980s. Such
killings dropped off dramatically after 1983.

   Amnesty International says witnesses
tell it Burmese troops have killed and tortured rice farmers and
other Shan tribespeople in suppressing an insurgency among Burma's
largest ethnic minority.
   The report by the London-based group, received in Bangkok today,
was the second documentation that Amnesty says shows ``a consistent
pattern of gross violations of human rights'' by the Burmese
military in trying to suppress minorities fighting for autonomy.
   In recent days, Amnesty and other private foreign organizations
have also expressed concern over mass arrests and killings of
anti-government demonstrators in Rangoon and other parts of the
country.
   The protestors, most from the Burman majority group, are
demanding a restoration of democracy after 26 years of
authoritarian rule.
   The latest, 25-page report said Shans interviewed by Amnesty
described 46 alleged extrajudicial executions and 58 alleged cases
of ``torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment'' in Burma's
Shan State.
   The information gathered, Amnesty said, also implicated soldiers
of 10 Burmese infantry units as well as intelligence and police
personnel. Most of the victims were said to be ordinary villagers
suspected of cooperating with various insurgent groups.
   They ranged from a 43-year-old villager bayoneted to death on
suspicion of aiding the insurgents to four men impressed as porters
for the army who had their skulls crushed by rifle butts for
failing to to keep up with a moving troop column.
   In May, Amnesty released a 71-page report detailing nearly 200
victims among the Karen, Kachin and Mon ethnic minority groups
among whom insurgency has also been rife for several decades.
   Amnesty said the Rangoon government apparently has not carried
out any of the steps the organization suggested in May to prevent
human rights abuses.
   ``The information available to Amnesty International remains
limited by the unwillingness of the Burmese government to grant
independent human rights investigators access to the country,'' the
report says. The Shans and others interviewed sought refuge in
Thailand.
   The Shans, who number some 4.2 million out of the country's 38
million people, began armed opposition to Rangoon in the late
1950s, operating in the rugged hills of eastern Burma.
   Some of the insurgent groups are described as mere traffickers
in opium, which is grown in great quantity in Shan State, but the
tribespeople also have a long tradition of seeking cultural and
political independence from the more powerful Burmans.
   A number of sources in recent years have reported that the
Burmese army has forced thousands of villagers into service as
porters for troops battling the Shans and other rebels.
   Josef Silverstein, an American author of several books on Burma,
said recently that about 13,000 peasants were recruited as porters
for a major offensive against Kachin insurgents last year.
   ``They were forced to walk ahead of troops in order to test for
mines; they were forced to carry munitions and supplies and, if
they refused or fell, they were beaten and often killed,'' the
professor at Rutgers University said.
   Amnesty cited several examples of alleged brutal mistreatment
and killing of porters including a 30-year-old villager who fell
while climbing up a steep slope and was stabbed to death in the
back by an enlisted man.
   ``The captain didn't reprimand the corporal who killed him. The
captain said it was a good thing because...now there was one fewer
of the (Shan) bastards,'' another porter who said he saw the
killing told Amnesty.
   Despite similar reports emerging from isolationist, non-aligned
Burma in recent years there has been little protest from
governments around the world and only few official comments about
the recent use of armed force against civilian demonstrators.
   The United States last week said it deplored the shooting of
unarmed demonstrators and urged that ``non-lethal means should be
employed to deal with such demonstrations.'' Five U.S. senators
introduced a resolution condemning the suppression of protest.
   There has been no known reaction to the alleged human rights
abuses by Japan and West Germany, the two major aid and loan donors
to Burma.
   American officials say privately the United States has normally
refrained from sharp criticism of the Rangoon government for fear
of jeopardizing its anti-narcotics program in the country. The
United States has supplied aircraft and chemicals which the Burmese
use to destroy opium fields by aerial spraying.

   A high-tech toilet seat that lowers automatically
and a speaking smoke detector that gives warnings in English or
Spanish are among the 250,000 products being displayed at the
National Hardware Show.
   With a push of the button, the seat can automatically move up or
down. It also can remove odors with its fanning mechanism and
charcoal filter, adjust its temperature to suit any posterior and
can kill germs with an ultraviolet light.
   While the seat does eliminate some age-old conflicts between men
and women, there is a catch. It retails for $350.
   ``The price is too high,'' acknowledged Keith Chiu, who
developed the device and is director of Eletto Industries Inc. of
Monterey Park, Calif. ``Most people won't pay $350 for what this
can do. At that price, I doubt if I'd buy it myself.''
   The four-day show, which began Sunday, is the biggest in its
43-year history and the country's largest trade show, said manager
Pat Dolson.
   About 70,000 retailers are expected to attend.
   William Farrell, executive director of the American Hardware
Manufacturers Association of Schaumburg, said do-it-yourselfers are
fueling the industry.
   They spent $52 billion last year at hardware, home center and
building supply outlets, and the market is expected to grow by 12
percent annually, to total $100 billion by 1990, he said.
   ``Do-it-yourself people are moving the home improvement industry
outdoors,'' said Ms. Dolson. ``It's a recreational thing for the
yuppie generation and we see tremendous growth in this area.''
   One prominent item for the outdoors do-it-yourselfer is a new
version of an old standby: the push lawnmower.
   American Lawn Mowers, a family-owned company based in
Shelbyville, Ind., is displaying its line of cast-iron push mowers
retailing for $69 to $99, which it says are ideal for the small
patch of grass around the condo patio.
   ``It's the lawnmower for the lifestyle of the new generation,''
said Teri McClain, a company sales representative. ``Joggers and
people into aerobics can get a workout mowing the lawn.''
   Ms. McClain said sales of the push mower are up 47 percent
during the past two years, after a lightweight 17-pound model of
the 50-year-old traditional design was introduced several years ago.
   For the non-athletically inclined, the show offered a
top-of-the-line Volvo lawnmower, a $5,000 riding vehicle with
four-wheel steering from Swedish maker Husqvarna.
   And then there's Vocalert, a computerized smoke detector that
not only sounds an alarm signal but can offer instructions in a
calm, authoritative voice.
   It has a built-in bilingual English-Spanish vocabulary of 100
words and phrases _ that can be programmed to tell people what to
do to escape _ such as ``stay calm'' or ``drop to the floor,''
depending on the intensity of the fire, which its sensors pick up.
   ``It has an intelligence to it and is good for situations in
which people are disoriented like children and the elderly,'' said
its inventor, Joseph Sansonetti, chief executive officer of Pioneer
Manufacturing Inc. of St. Petersburg, Fla.
   Sansonetti said about 1.2 million are being produced, with the
suggested retail price $89.95. He said it should be available in
store by mid-fall.
   ``It's going to eliminate the confusion for everyone,'' he said.

   Ferarri was founder and chairman of the company bearing his name
that makes luxury sports cars and renowned Formula One racers.
   Born in February 1898, he entered motor racing at age 22 and
drove with the Alfa Romeo team for 11 years. In 1929, he founded
Ferrari Ltd., beginning in 1940 to build cars that have since won
numerous Grand Prix and championship races.
   The company statement said Ferrari's son Piero, mother Lina and
wife Floriana were at his side when he died. No other details were
given.
   Last month, Franco Gozzi, a company spokesman, confirmed that
Ferrari was being treated at home for kidney troubles and ``for
ailments typical of his age.''
   Ferrari was forced to reduce his business activities last
February when he came down with influenza.
   When Pope John Paul II visited the Ferrari factory in Maranello
in June, Ferrari was unable to meet him because of his frail health.

   Israeli troops shot
and killed a Palestinian in the West Bank today, hospital officials
said, and the army confined 650,000 Arabs to their Gaza Strip homes
after three days of violence.
   Soldiers sealed off the entire Gaza Strip with an indefinite
curfew, barring visitors and journalists for the third time since
the Palestinian uprising began Dec. 8.
   The move followed clashes in Gaza on Sunday in which the army
said its soldiers shot and wounded 12 Palestinians. Arab reports
put the figure at 25 wounded.
   Also Sunday, a firebomb hurled at a car traveling to a Jewish
settlement injured six Israelis, including an 8-month-old burned on
the face and arms.
   Witnesses said soldiers went door-to-door in some areas of Gaza
City, ordering residents to go out and paint over slogans on walls,
take down Palestinian flags and clean up debris from demonstrations.
   Some slogans said: ``Strike and Confrontation,'' ``We Will Never
Kneel Before the Zionists'' and ``Deportations and Arrests Will
Never Scare Us.''
   Journalists were stopped by soldiers at the Erez checkpoint
leading into the Gaza Strip. Army officers said knots of protesters
set burning tires along the road from the checkpoint to Gaza City.
   As a result of the curfew, the 50,000 Arab workers from the Gaza
Strip were unable to go to their jobs in Israel.
   Arab reporters and hospital officials said Jamal Odeh, 21, was
shot through the heart today after nightlong demonstrations at the
Tulkarem refugee camp in the West Bank, where youths set up
roadblocks and burned tires.
   His death brought to 244 the number of Palestinians killed in
the 8-month-old uprising against 21 years of Israeli occupaiton.
Four Israelis have also died.
   Palestinians attributed the outbreak in Gaza to the burning
deaths of two Arab workers near Tel Aviv. Police said Jewish
extremists may have torched a hut where three Arab builders slept
near a construction site.
   No one has been arrested.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, speaking on Israel radio,
attributed the sudden upsurge of violence to a show of strength by
Moslem fundamentalists who had called for demonstrations to mark
the start of the new Islamic year 1409.
   Rabin said Israeli authorities adopted a new stategy to choke
off the violence, uprooting village and neighborhood Palestinian
committees which have sought to run community affairs and
coordinate anti-Israeli activities.
   He also said the army had been ordered to ``shoot to hit''
firebomb-throwers and ``if one is caught, to demolish his home
without granting him right of apppeal.''
   Palestinian leaders protested the Israeli clampdown that
confined the entire Gaza population to their homes as an attempt to
``terrorize'' civilians.
   ``What the Israelis are doing is really inhuman, and they keep
doing it despite all the protests from all over the world. It seems
that Israel translates the protests into a `Keep going' message,''
said Dr. Hayder Abdul Shafi, head of the Red Crescent (Red Cross)
in the Gaza Strip.
   Jewish settlers called on the government to take tougher
measures after the firebomb attack, in which four Israeli children
and two adults were burned while en route to the Neve Dekalim
settlement.
   ``The army met with us and conveyed they would take a series of
severe decisions ... uprooting orchards, destroying houses,
deporting whoever did it,'' said Menachem Beit-Halachmi, a
spokesman for the Jewish settlement movement in the Gaza Strip.
   ``With that report, we were able to ask our people not to go out
to the area themselves,'' he said, referring to the settlers'
threat to take vigilante action.
   Israeli officials, meanwhile, gave a mixed reacton to statements
by Salah Khalaf, the No. 2 man in Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction.
   He told the weekly French magazine Journal du Dimanche that the
PLO was considering forming a provisional government that would
drop its demand for the elimination of the state of Israel.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity
said officials would ``study attentively'' the text of the
interview which officials expected to receive later in the day.
   Privately, sources close to Israel's liberal foreign minister,
Shimon Peres, said they welcomed the debate among Palestinians.
   ``It's a positive thing when people talk politics instead of
war,'' said a source who demanded anonymity.
   However, Yossi Ahimier, a spokesman for right-wing Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, noted the firebomb attack on Israeli
civilians in Gaza and said ``we have to watch what they do not what
they say.''
   He said Khalaf's proposal was a tactical move and was not based
on a sincere desire for coexistence.

   Wanted: A new king of the wild frontier.
Being born on a mountaintop in Tennessee helpful, but not required.
   Walt Disney Studios and NBC are bringing back Davy Crockett and
held an open casting call Sunday to expand the search for an actor
to fill the role played on television by Fess Parker in the 1950s.
   William Blinn, the executive producer of the show that will be
part of ``The Magical World of Disney,'' said the search has gone
on for more than five months and has auditioned more than 800
people.
   ``It's a quality of strength and intelligence and a kind of
implied humor that Fess always brought to it, and a kind of droll
warmth. That's hard to find,'' Blinn said.
   The producer said he wasn't interested in a ``Rambo'' sort of
hero or the muscle-bound characters played by Arnold Schwarzenegger.
   ``They don't offer humor in their portrayal, nor do they offer
to me a guy that is at ease with himself _ they have a great deal
of tension,'' Blinn said.
   The series, scheduled to premiere in November, is based on the
life of Crockett, a frontiersman who fought river pirates and
Indians and served in the Tennessee Legislature in the 1820s and
1830s.
   The old show's theme song identified Crockett as the frontier
king who was born on a mountaintop in Tennessee.
   Kevin DuBay, one of the more than 75 actors at the casting call,
said he had a coonskin cap and watched reruns of the series as a
child.
   ``It was important when you played cowboys and Indians to know
who Davy Crockett was,'' the 25-year-old said.
   Joel Mills, 27, said he shares a love of the outdoors with
Crockett and believes it is important to have old-fashioned heroes
like Crockett.
   ``I think our children deserve better than Rambo,'' he said.
   Parker will appear in the first two-hour episode as an elder
statesman reflecting on his youth.
   The new ``Davy Crockett'' will be rotated on NBC's weekly ``The
Magical World Of Disney'' with other features, including cartoons
and a re-creation of ``The Absent-Minded Professor'' with Harry
Anderson in the title role.

<TEXT>
   British Columbia
Premier Bill Vander Zalm has become the godfather of a baby born to
an unmarried stripper who says his stand against abortion persuaded
her not to end her pregnancy.
   Vander Zalm attended one-month-old Richard Hinde's baptism
Sunday at a Roman Catholic church here. At the time the premier
accepted the invitation from the boy's mother, Serina Hinde, he was
unaware she had been a stripper.
   ``We're forgiving and we're loving,'' Vander Zalm said after the
ceremony. ``The main thing is that Richard be brought up a good
little Christian boy.''
   Vander Zalm, whose administration has introduced a program to
provide counseling and alternatives to abortion, said he was
honored to be the godfather and would monitor the child's
upbringing.
   Ms. Hinde, 26, is a native of Calgary, Alberta, who completed
two years of economics at the University of British Columbia.
   ``I don't think it's anybody's business what I do or whatever,''
she said. ``The issue is that I have a baby that's alive. It's not
what you do for a living, it's who you are as a person.''

   Sad-eyed, white-whiskered Olga, the
nation's oldest walrus in captivity, has died.
   The 27-year-old Atlantic walrus died of old age Sunday, said
veterinarian William Torgerson. Olga, who weighed about 2,700
pounds, had been at the Brookfield Zoo outside Chicago since 1962,
when she was a 6-month old pup.
   ``She was quite a character,'' said zoo spokeswoman Linda Elbert.
   Olga gained national attention in 1979 when zoo officials were
seeking ``zoo parents'' to help underwrite costs. At that time, the
tab for Olga's fresh-frozen mackerel and herring diet _ 60 pounds a
day _ was $13,000 a year.
   More than $20,000 in contributions came in from some 1,000
``parents'' across the nation.
   ``We used to celebrate her birthday each year with her adoptive
parents and Olga was one for shows,'' Ms. Elbert said. ``She'd
whistle, blow kisses, wave her flippers and spray the crowd when
nobody expected it. She was just a real joy.''
   Olga, who came to Brookfield from the Copenhagen Zoo in Denmark,
began suffering kidney problems late last month.

<TEXT>
   A government-run newspaper says Iran will do
all it can to secure the freedom of British hostages in Lebanon but
is requesting in return that Britain help find Iranians missing
there.
   The word came in a Sunday editorial in the English-language
Tehran Times and coincided with a visit by British diplomat David
Reddaway, who said Foreign Ministry officials told him he will be
able to meet this week with an Englishman being held on spying
charges.
   In London, a senior aide to Archbishop of Canterbury Robert
Runcie said today he is cautious about a quick release of hostages
following talks with an Iranian diplomat in London.
   The Tehran Times editorial said: ``Undoubtedly the Islamic
Republic of Iran will spare no effort to press ahead with the
release of British hostages, particularly Terry Waite,'' referring
to Runcie's envoy.
   ``Yet what Iran legitimately expects of Britain is to provide
Iran with all the information possible about the fate of four
Iranian hostages'' believed held by Christian militia ``under the
influence of Britain,'' it added.
   Four Iranians disappeared in a Christian-controlled area of
Lebanon in 1982. No group ever claimed to hold them and some
reports have said they were killed.
   Waite and two other Britons are among 18 foreigners believed
held by groups affiliated with the pro-Iranian and Shiite Moslem
Hezbollah, or Party of God, in Lebanon. The 18 include nine
Americans.
   The editorial also follows talks in Britain last week between
Runcie, spiritual leader of the Anglican Church, and Mohamed Reza
Said Mohamedi, an Iranian Foreign Ministry official.
   John Lyttle, Runcie's senior assistant, said in London today
that whether Iran chooses to pressure for the release of the
British captives remains to be seen.
   ``I don't think this is the time to talk about either assurances
or promises,'' Lyttle said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio
interview.
   ``I'm optimistic that he (Terry Waite) is alive and that the
other British hostages are alive. As to whether anything is going
to happen quickly, I'm rather more cautious,'' he said.
   Lyttle said he and the archbishop made clear to Mohamedi that
the church has a limited role as far as the hostages are concerned.
   ``We want to make it quite plain that the church cannot be an
alternative diplomatic channel, but that its interest is a
humanitarian one and a rather particular one. We may be able to oil
a wheel here and there, but we certainly can't act as an
alternative diplomatic channel,'' he said.
   Reddaway said he met with Foreign Ministry officials twice on
Sunday and they told him he would be able to meet jailed Englishman
Roger Cooper this week. He gave no other details.
   Cooper, 52, a nephew of the late British poet and novelist
Robert Graves, was arrested in December 1985 and has been held in
Tehran's Evin Prison.
   Before leaving London on Friday, Reddaway said he would speak
with officials about the foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   In July, an Anglican bishop went to Lebanon to initiate
inquiries among Christians about the fate of the four Iranians
missing in Lebanon.
   Iran has been making conciliatory statements about relations
with Western nations since it announced July 18 it was accepting a
U.N. call for a cease-fire in the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war.
   The cease-fire is scheduled to take hold Saturday.
   Last summer, Britain withdrew all its diplomats from Iran and
virtually severed ties after a British diplomat was detained and
beaten in apparent reprisal for British police arresting an Iranian
envoy on shoplifting charges. One Iranian diplomat remains in
London.
   Waite disappeared in January 1987 while trying to secure the
release of American hostages. The other two British citizens
believed held in Lebanon are journalist John McCarthy, kidnapped on
April 17, 1986 and university professor Brian Keenan, kidnapped
April 11, 1986. Keenan also holds an Irish passport.
   Britain says it also seeks word on Alec Collett, a New
York-based British journalist whose Palestinian abductors claim
they killed him. His body was never found.
   The foreigner held longest is American Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was abducted
March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Police Dogs Taught To Bark Before Biting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The police department is training police
dogs to bark instead of bite _ but a civil rights activist says
many people will never forget the news images of protesters being
mauled in the 1960s.
   ``Unfortunately, the 25-year-old image of police dogs (in
Birmingham) still lives,'' said the Rev. Abraham Woods, pastor of
St. Joseph Baptist Church.
   Sgt. Cameron Guy said the program is part of the department's
minimal-force arrest policy, under which a suspect will be given
every chance to surrender peacefully.
   ``A felon breaking into a business deserves to be off the
street, but he does not need to be dog-bitten,'' said Guy, who
directs the canine unit.
   Guy said the policy is a move to boost professionalism in the
department.
   During civil rights protests in Birmingham in the 1960s, newsmen
filmed snarling police dogs biting protesters. Those films have
been shown frequently since then.
   Woods said he has been invited to watch the department
demonstrate its new policy.
   The dogs are being trained to sprint toward the suspect and,
instead of sinking their teeth into the suspect's arm, veer off at
the last moment, blocking any escape attempt, while barking loudly
and baring their teeth.
   Guy said the dog will bite if a suspect tries to attack the
accompanying officer or the animal.

   People who weren't too chicken to crow
like roosters or cackle like hens held the spotlight at the
Illinois State Fair, along with wives calling their husbands and
men their calling hogs.
   For as much as $75 in prize money, contestants could imitate
roosters and hens, or be the best at calling their husbands or hogs.
   ``I figured for $75 I could make a fool of myself,'' says Phil
Bartz, winner of Saturday's rooster crowing contest.
   He donned a white hood complete with red comb before crouching
down to scurry around in front of a crowd of people and crow like a
rooster.
   He wasn't the only one of the 15 contestants in the fair's first
rooster crowing and hen cackling contests who was in it for the
money.
   ``Cold, hard cash,'' was how Frank Nordike of Carlyle described
his motivation for entering the contest.
   Nordike won a $10, third-place prize for his rooster imitation,
which included some amorous advances toward a woman who was
supposed to be a hen.
   The winners in the husband and hog calling contests said they
weren't in it for the money.
   ``I enjoy it and I love pigs,'' said Marvin Routzong of
Springboro, Ohio, who was named Grand Champion Hog Caller for a
third consecutive year on Sunday.
   The factory supervisor's routine combines realism with whimsy as
he enters the arena, dumps some corn from a bucket and begins
hitting the bucket with an ear of corn.
   That ``is how you really call a pig,'' he said.
   Then Routzong hit the highlight of his performance with a chorus
of ``Pig-o-lo, pig-o-lo, pig-o-lo, pig,'' in an operatic baritone.
   The Grand Champion Husband Caller was also a three-time winner.
   Paula Tyler of Chillicothe won the prize by dressing like a hag
and reading an instruction manual on how to call a husband. ``When
it comes time to yell don't be shy, just open your mouth and let
her fly,'' she screamed as she read from the manual.
   And she did.
   ``Donnnnnnnald,'' rang from the rafters in the Swine Barn.
   And out scurried Donald, Mrs. Tyler's husband, who ran up and
gave her a kiss.
   He wore a ``husband'' sign around his neck so spectators would
know who he was.
   Tyler said he wasn't embarrassed by all the attention.
   ``Something to do on a Sunday afternoon,'' he said.

<HEAD>Coroner Changes Policy To Aid Police Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unidentified women slain in San Diego County no
longer will be cremated in order to preserve evidence for police
investigating links between a serial killing spree here and
Washington's Green River slayings.
   County coroner David Stark also said his office will perform
more extensive tests on the bodies of unidentified women that may
be linked to the deaths of at least 10 other women in San Diego
County since 1985.
   The policy was prompted by criticism last week from homicide
detectives. Detectives from both states have been studying
similarities between the two murder cases for at least 18 months
but said no conclusive link has been made.
   One body was cremated before being linked to the San Diego
County case, Stark said.
   ``We will change our procedure,'' Stark said. ``When the
circumstances of a death clearly indicate that a homicide situation
has occurred _ even though we can't establish a cause of death _ in
the future we will request that the person will be buried.''
   In San Diego, unidentified bodies normally are cremated after
three months. In King County, Wash., where the Green River
investigation is based, unidentified remains are held in an office
or buried after extensive body X-rays.
   Unidentified remains that are buried or stored can be exhumed
later for future examination.
   The Green River case has been described as the nation's worst
unsolved serial murder case.
   The remains of 40 young women have been found around Seattle and
Portland, Ore., and eight missing young women are thought to have
been slain by the killer, who mostly preyed on women linked to
prostitution or other street life.
   The last slaying linked with the Green River killer occurred in
1984.
   Since June 1985, 30 slain women have been found near freeways in
San Diego County. Authorities say between 10 and 18 are the work of
the same killer.

<HEAD>Navy Probe Finds Intelligence Messages Lost</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than 150 secret Navy documents, including
decoding materials and details of sensitive electronic-warfare
equipment, were lost by engineers and officers at an installation
here, a newspaper reported.
   No evidence was found that the documents were sold to or
obtained by hostile agents, but it ``cannot be discounted that the
unaccounted-for secret material may have been subjected to
compromise,'' said a Navy report obtained by The San Diego Union.
   Navy officials declined comment because the report is under
review, the newspaper reported Sunday.
   In March, then-acting Navy Secretary Lawrence Garrett blamed the
lost documents on poor bookkeeping and lax supervision.
   Navy investigators discovered that 158 documents were missing
after an audit of recordkeeping last year at the Naval Electronic
Systems Engineering Center at Air Force Plant 19, the report said.
   Among the missing materials were manuals on Sea Nymph submarine
sensors designed to pick up enemy radar and conversations and data
about anti-missile early-warning devices, the newspaper said.
   Also unaccounted for were ``key cards,'' or cryptography keys to
encoding and decoding military communications.
   The missing documents were from 1979 through 1984.
   The report strongly criticized Capt. Kirby W. Hansen, commander
of the center during much of that time, but recommended no
discipline against him. He retired in 1986.
   However, disciplinary action is pending against John E. Hassett
of Chula Vista, a civil servant who was supervisor of the
classified mailroom vault at the command from 1981 until 1987, the
newspaper said.
   Hassett said he noticed documents were missing but added, ``I
didn't think there was anything clandestine, just poor accounting
of the publications by the various departments.''
   The report called for a new computer system for tracking
classified documents. The system already has been implemented, Navy
officials said.

   George Bush, intentionally staying behind as
the opening spotlight plays on President Reagan, said today that
``pressure is mounting'' on him as time grows short before his
Thursday night acceptance speech as the Republican presidential
nominee.
   However, the vice president indicated he felt no pressure to
reveal the one big secret of the party's convention _ the name of
his running mate.
   Making the rounds of the morning network interview shows, he
said he was still ``getting it clear in my mind'' and reiterated
his vow to tell no one his choice in advance after he does decide.
   Campaign aides insist that Bush will withhold the announcement
until Thursday morning _ partly to build suspense and coax a larger
television audience for the Thursday night speech.
   He said there are still multiple contenders for the No. 2 spot.
   ``I have not decided. And I probably will say when I have
decided,'' he said on ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   On ``CBS This Morning,'' Bush said, ``I have not told a soul
what I'm thinking and I literally mean that _ not Jim Baker (his
new campaign chairman), not Barbara Bush. Nobody.''
   Bush told NBC's ``Today'' show that once he does make up his
mind, ``I think my choice will be widely accepted'' at the
convention.
   He said that he feels pressure as the night of his speech nears
_ a night that both Republican and Democratic leaders say will be
important for the fall campaign _ but he also said, ``I'm an
athlete'' and can handle pressure.
   Bush was working on his acceptance speech again today. He
arrives in New Orleans on Tuesday.
   Asked if he was concerned that people would compare him with
Reagan, Bush said such comparisons were inevitable.
   But, he told ABC, ``I've got to be what I am and I'm not going
to try to be somebody else.'' He called the convention ``a big
moment for me, the culmination of a lot of years of politics.''
   He told CBS that he planned to have his entire family with him
at the convention. ``Gov. Dukakis did a good job on that (showing
off his family) at the Democratic convention. But we've got a
stronger bench. And we've got a great family.''
   Spokeswoman Sheila Tate said Sunday that Bush already had been
through three drafts of the speech, written with speechwriter Peggy
Noonan, and had practiced it Sunday afternoon at his official vice
presidential residence with media consultant Roger Ailes.
   Bush also had lunch Sunday with Baker, the outgoing Treasury
secretary.
   Aides said Bush still hopes to delay a final announcement of his
vice presidential choice until Thursday morning. However, one
source said aides are considering whether to unveil the choice
Wednesday night.
   Names being most frequently mentioned are Senate Republican
Leader Bob Dole of Kansas and his wife, former Transportation
Secretary Elizabeth Dole; Rep. Jack Kemp of New York; Sen. Alan
Simpson of Wyoming; Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana; Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh of Pennsylvania; and Sen. Pete V. Domenici of New
Mexico.
   Many of the would-be candidates made the rounds of television
talk shows Sunday. Simpson, on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' disclosed
he had asked Bush to remove his name from the list.
   ``I would be a liability for George,'' Simpson said, citing his
support for limiting Social Security benefit increases and his
belief that the next president will have to increase taxes to trim
the federal deficit as among the positions he had taken that would
``fail the litmus test.''
   However, a top Bush campaign official, who insisted upon
anonymity, said on Sunday that Simpson was sending ``mixed
signals'' and that his comments were not necessarily an indication
that he would be dropped from Bush's short list.
   Bush, in making his final selection, is not necessarily limiting
himself to those whose names have been frequently mentioned, the
official said.
   In a separate appearance on ABC's ``This Week with David
Brinkley,'' Quayle, at 41 the youngest of those believed to be
under consideration, said, ``I would like to believe that I would
be acceptable to the whole party.''
   And Dole declared, ``I am not running for vice president.''
Then, referring to his wife, he added: ``I'm not campaigning for
anyone, but she would be a great addition to the ticket.''
   Thornburgh, meanwhile, said it was ``very flattering'' to be
mentioned but ``I have a job to do for this president.''
   Craig Fuller, Bush's chief of staff, said on ``Meet the Press''
that Thornburgh would ``make a good attorney general'' but quickly
added, ``I didn't say for how long,'' suggesting his remarks
shouldn't be interpreted to suggest Thornburgh was no longer under
consideration.
   Meanwhile, the vice president, not generally known for his
prowess as a public speaker, continued to focus attention on his
acceptance speech. In addition to his practice in Washington, time
has been set aside in New Orleans for a rehearsal in the Superdome,
aides said.

   Charging riot police today broke up
radical students who tried to march to the North Korean border for
reunification talks and troopers brutally beat and kicked
protesters.
   Waves of troopers in green combat fatigues and black visored
helmets charged the students as they tried to march out of Yonsei
University in western Seoul. Police armored vans also fired salvos
of tear gas bombs into the screaming students.
   ``Unite the fatherland'' and ``Yankee go home,'' students yelled.
   Police dragged away about 200 students, some of them screaming
with fear and pain. The unresisting students huddled in groups on
the ground, clinging to each other as troopers beat them with fists
and even riot shields.
   Senior police officers hit and slapped their own men to try to
stop the beatings.
   President Roh Tae-woo, in a speech today to mark Independence
Day, called radical students a threat to next month's Summer
Olympics and said disorder would not be tolerated.
   ``The people and the government will not forgive anyone who
spoils the (Olympic) festival through mob action or the throwing of
firebombs,'' he said.
   The students tried to march out of the college three times, but
were beaten back by police. Marchers did not try to fight back,
except when police pushed deep into the campus and students
attacked them with clubs and rocks.
   They apparently decided not to resist initially and let
themselves be arrested, departing from their normal tactic of being
first to start violence. Some said they volunteered to be arrested.
   About 3,000 students had assembled on the campus to try to march
35 miles north to the border truce site of Panmunjom for talks with
North Korean student delegates on reuniting the divided Korean
peninsula. The government banned the march and deployed 25,000 riot
police in Seoul to stop it.
   The North Korean students waited for two hours in Panmonjum
today but left when the South Korean students failed to arrive,
according to a report by the North's official Korean Central News
Agency. It was monitored in Tokyo.
   The South Korean radical students, a small but powerful minority
on campuses, have virtually no public support and protests last
week attracted just a few thousand people. Still, Koreans fear that
violent protests by the radicals could cast a shadow over the
Olympics.
   After the march was blocked, students regrouped on the campus
and surged out with firebombs and rocks to battle the 7,000 riot
police around the school. Police vans blasted tear gas bombs and
both sides pelted each other with rocks.
   Police had few problems containing the students. Students were
unable to get past troopers surrounding the university.
   Hundreds of students tried to stage protests in other parts of
Seoul or get to train stations to reach the border. But riot police
quickly broke up protests and seized scores of radicals.
   Roads leading to the border were also blocked by riot police.
   A similar attempt to march to Panmunjom on June 10 was blocked
by police, and the turnout for today's march appeared considerably
smaller.
   Student leaders told a rally before trying to march out of
Yonsei that the radicals would not stop trying to oust the Roh
government and reunite the two Koreas.
   Dozens of students cut their fingers with razors and wrote
slogans in blood.
   ``We will never give up until we have destroyed the military
dictatorship and reunited our nation,'' one leader said.
   The radicals also denounced the United States, saying Washington
supports military rule in South Korea. They demanded the withdrawal
of the 42,000 U.S. troops based here under a treaty.
   Two American leftists, Sue Bailey of Washington D.C., and
Charles Scheiner of White Plains, N.Y., told the rally they brought
messages of support from radicals in the United States. They told
the students millions of Americans support their struggle and want
U.S. troops out of South Korea.
   President Roh called for greater efforts to ease tension between
North and South Korea. He proposed reunification talks with North
Korean President Kim Il Sung.
   Similar proposals in the past have not led to talks, but the two
Koreas are considering parliamentary talks on easing tension. A
first meeting may be held at Panmunjom on Friday.
   Radical students have seized on the reunification issue to try
to mobilize public support for their anti-government campaign.
   The students say they are not communists, but insist that the
peninsula must be reunited immediately with political differences
to be worked out later. Most South Koreans fear the North is
determined to conquer them.
   The peninsula has been divided since 1945 at the end of World
War II. North Korea invaded the South in 1950 to start the Korean
War, which ended three years later without a political solution.

   The government announced today it will
abolish the state tourism agency and said major hotels, restaurants
and other facilities will be sold or leased to the private sector.
   The Revolution Command Council, which passed the decree Aug. 2,
said state-run assets to be privatized included seven hotels in
Baghdad, as well as properties in the war-battered southern port
city of Basra and the northern city of Mosul.
   Hotels not sold will be leased for 25 years to private
companies, the council said.
   The Basra Sheraton Hotel was damaged by shell and rocket fire
during a Iranian offensive in early 1987, when some of the heaviest
fighting in the 8-year-old Persian Gulf war took place.
   The state-owned facilities also include a tourist complex in
Habaniya, west of Baghdad, and several modern resorts in the
northern mountains, the scene of heavy fighting in the war.
   The managers of the hotels said they did not know if the
facilities will be sold to Iraq's private sector or to their parent
companies.
   Officials said the hotels are to be run by their parent chains
in accordance with an agreement signed with the Iraqi government.
   Tourism in Iraq, which is rich in archaeological sites, has
diminished as a result of the conflict, but no statistics were
available.
   The move to sell the facilities is part of President Saddam
Hussein's drive to stimulate the economy. The announcement came as
Iranian and Iraqi leaders prepared to meet in Geneva Aug. 25 for
peace talks under a United Nations-mediated cease-fire.

   A heat wave that set records from Arizona to the Atlantic was
blamed for a riot that injured eight at a sweltering Massachusetts
jail, and utility officials in New England warned of blackouts
today unless users conserve.
   In Texas, 35 Salvadoran aliens spent five hours Sunday locked
inside a broiling boxcar with almost no ventilation and probably
would have died had they not been discovered, U.S. Border Patrol
officials said.
   In New York City, a carriage horse collapsed from the heat on a
main thoroughfare but got up the strenth to move on after being
hosed down.
   New York's Road Runners Club, spurred by the heatstroke deaths
of two joggers during the past five weeks, took down the clock for
a Central Park race so runners wouldn't be tempted to push
themselves. No problems were reported.
   In Boston, the temperature jumped from 78 to 92 degrees in 10
minutes. Sunday was the fifth consecutive day of record heat for
Beckley, W.V., and in Arizona, where Phoenix had the nation's high
at 113, it was 89 after midnight.
   Milwaukee exeeded 90 for the 34th day this year, breaking the
33-day record of 1955. Madison recorded 95 degrees, a record for
the date in Wisconsin's capital.
   Temperatures topped 90 for the 17th straight day in northern New
Jersey. Newark tied a 1944 record of 98 Sunday, the 40th day of
90-degree temperatures this summer. That equals the record for the
most 90-degree days in one year.
   In New York City, where the high was 97 degrees, Sunday was the
31st day this summer that temperatures have peaked above 90. The
record is 37 days.
   ``The heat's gonna kill people,'' said Mary Morena, a palm
reader and spirtual adviser. ``People are too nervous, too cranky,
too hot. It's very bad for your sex life.''
   Inmates aggravated by the heat, overcrowding and the food twice
set fire to a 144-year-old granite jail in Lawrence, Mass. One
blaze at the jail, which has no air conditioning, destroyed a wing
containing 36 cells, about a quarter of the jail.
   Nearly 200 of the 250 inmates were relocated to other prisons
around the state, said jail Superintendent William Mageary.
   As New Yorkers returned from weekend activities and cranked up
the air conditioning, power demand hit a record for a Sunday,
according to Consolidated Edison.
   New England power officials warned Sunday night that blackouts
could occur throughout the six-state region today unless users
conserved electricity.
   A shutdown this weekend of the Maine Yankee nuclear power plant
and one of four generators on Salem Harbor in Massachusetts has
made things worse.
   ``If we don't get a considerable contribution by our customers,
as we did a number of days last week, we may not be able to provide
uninterrupted service,'' said Bill Sheperdson, a spokesman for New
England Power Pool, which serves Massachusetts, Maine, Rhode
Island, Connecticut, Vermont and New Hampshire.
   Die-hards who thought they could live without mechanically
cooled air begged for mercy from air conditioner salesmen who long
since had sold out their stock.
   ``It's not really for me, it's for my piano,'' said Kent Tritle,
a customer in Uncle Steve's electronics store. Tritle said he was a
musician whose $7,200 Steinway couldn't take it anymore. ``The
piano is screaming for relief. The keys stick, the response is all
mucked up, the music is slow.''
   Salesman Ira Parker said he'd sold everything, including demos
and displays.
   Entomologists in the New York metropolitan area said the
mosquito population had surged to four times its normal level
because of too little rain in June, too much rain in July and high
humidity in August.
   The 35 aliens found in Kingsville, Texas, were being held Sunday
night, Border Patrol agent Ramiro Gonzalez said.
   ``It was well over 100 degrees (outside) when we found them,''
Gonzalez said. ``It was probably another 20 to 30 degrees hotter
inside the car.''

<HEAD>Italian Communist Party Official Dead at 73</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIVORNO, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Giuliano Pajetta, a member of the Italian
Communist Party's Central Committee and a former parliamentarian,
died today after a long illness, the party announced. He was 73.
   Pajetta began his political career in 1930, at age 15, when he
was arrested for anti-fascist activities. He fled Italy, first to
the Soviet Union and then to Spain, where he fought the fascists.
   In 1944, he became one of the organizers and leaders of the
Italian Resistance group ``volunteers for liberty.''
   After the war, Pajetta served in both the Chamber of Deputies
and the Senate of the Italian Parliament until 1972. He was a
member of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party
until his death.

<HEAD>Army Called To Search For Missing Actress</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   About 100 soldiers today
searched for a 26-year-old French actress who disappeared last week
from her mother's vacation home.
   Pauline Lafont, who has appeared in such films as ``The Summer
of Gentle Decline,'' was last seen Thursday when she told family
members she was going for a walk in the mountains near this village
about 45 miles northwest of Nimes.
   Police said they did not know what might have happened to Miss
Lafont.
   Her mother, Bernadette Lafont, also an actress, said she was
sure her daughter would not have run away.
   The soldiers were ordered to help police and rescue workers
search the rugged terrain of the Cevennes mountains, the army said
in a statement.
   Miss Lafont's brother, David, said she knew the area well and
took long hikes in the region. An earlier search was called off
Saturday, but David Lafont made a public appeal Sunday for help in
tracing his sister.

   George Bush, aware of the warm images of
hearth and home evoked by Michael and Kitty Dukakis in Atlanta last
month, promised today to show America ``exactly how much my great,
strong, big family means to me.''
   Bush, who has four sons and a daughter, concedes Dukakis did a
good job at the Democratic National Convention with his speech and
``showing those wonderfully warm pictures'' of his family.
   Now the vice president said, it is his turn.
   ``You know, on family ... I've always tried to hold that a
little bit close,'' he said on ABC-TV. ``And yet, I think I have to
share now with the American people exactly how much my great,
strong, big family means to me.''
   Earlier, the vice president said the Bushes ``come out of a
little more conservative tradition. We haven't been able to speak
as glowingly and as warmly, not because we didn't believe, because
it was different somehow.''
   Marvin Bush, one of Bush's sons, said today on NBC-TV: ``Mike
Dukakis has nothing on George Bush when it comes to real family.''
   In Atlanta, Dukakis' voice caught as he talked about his
deceased father. And there were warm words for his mother Euterpe,
an introduction from his cousin Olympia and fond embraces between
the Massachusetts governor and his wife.
   Bush's children _ all of whom are delegates _ are making the
rounds in New Orleans, talking to other delegates, attending
receptions, working behind the scenes, generally stoking the fires
for Dad.
   Grandson George Prescott Bush will lead the Pledge of Allegiance
on Tuesday. Son Jeb Bush will address the convention on Wednesday
night and on Thursday, Bush's wife of 43 years, Barbara, will speak.
   All told, there will be more than 60 Bush relatives here.
   After a Bush clan dinner Wednesday, Bush's eldest son George _ a
Texas delegate and a top strategist in his father's campaign _ will
announce the delegation's 111 votes that will put Bush oer the top.
   ``To have his son of the same name put him over the top speaks
about family and the commitment of our family to work hard for the
person we love,'' George Jr. said in an interview.
   Issues such as day care, health care for the elderly, parental
leave and other family-related concerns have become important in
the 1988 campaign, and the Republicans don't intend to concede that
ground to the Democrats.
   Great pains will be taken to portray the nominee as a family
man. Much of that testimony will come from his children, all
actively involved in the campaign and some of them expert
campaigners in their own right.
   ``Up to now, George Bush has been reluctant to talk about his
family, his religion, things of a personal nature,'' George Jr.
says. ``Obviously the American people are demanding more than just
issues. Part of the convention will be George Bush opening up, his
family speaking out about love.''
   George Jr., 42, admits to being a seasoned politician. He ran
for Congress unsuccessfully and now is a Bush campaign strategist.
Jeb Bush, 35, is secretary of the Florida Department of Commerce
and worked in his father's 1980 presidential campaign.
   Neil Bush, 33, lives in Denver and worked on his brother
George's congressional campaign and on the 1980 presidential
campaign. Marvin Bush, 31, has his own investment consulting firm
in Alexandria, Va.
   Dorothy Bush LeBlond will turn 29 on the day her father accepts
his party's nomination for president. Described as an
``aggressive'' campaigner, she currently lives in Cape Elizabeth,
Maine.
   The vice president's two brothers, Prescott and Jonathan, and
sister, Nancy Ellis, will be in attendance this week, as will an
assortment of cousins, nieces, nephews and Bush's 10 grandchildren.
His immediate family will surround Bush as he accepts the
nomination.
   ``I have goose bumps,'' said Dorothy Stapleton of Greenwich,
Conn., Bush's first cousin who is also a delegate. ``A lot of us
have been working for this for a long time.''
   George Bush Jr. says the family display at the convention,
choreographed though it may be, won't be ``put on.''
   ``It'll be a very sincere expression of love,'' he says.
   But as for Bush and his wife, convention-viewers should not
expect to see the kind of embraces or affectionate moments the
Dukakises are fond of _ once they were spotted dancing at an
airport in the absence of music. The Bushes aren't given to that
type of display and seem to be a bit touchy about the subject.
   ``I'm not going to dance with her ... with no music. I'm not
going to go that far,'' the vice president said. ``I don't like to
dance anyway, and she knows I'm lousy at it.''

<HEAD>July Gain, Double June's, 10th in a Row</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Production at the nation's factories, mines
and utilities surged 0.8 percent in July, the biggest increase in
nine months, the government reported today.
   The Federal Reserve said the large July advance was double the
0.4 percent increase in June.
   It marked the tenth consecutive month that the index has risen
without a decline and it was the largest advance since a 1.1
percent increase last October.
   Analysts had expected a big advance given the fact that
employment at manufacturing plants climbed at the fastest pace this
year, according to the Labor Department's July employment report.
However, the consensus forecast was for a rise of around 0.6
percent.
   The manufacturing sector has been the star of the economy this
year as American producers, aided by a weak dollar, have enjoyed
strong foreign sales.
   However, concern that the economy might be growing too rapidly,
with demand outstripping production capabilities, was one of the
reasons cited by the Federal Reserve when it raised the discount
rate last week.
   The increase in industrial production came despite the fact that
auto output actually fell during the month. Autos were assembled at
an annual rate of 7.1 million units, down from June's pace of 7.5
million units. The production of light trucks also decreased during
the month.
   The strength came from a continued surge in the production of
business equipment, including computers, which jumped 1 percent in
July following an equally strong 0.9 percent rise in June.
   Production of consumer goods rose 0.3 percent during the month,
reflecting gains in appliance production and non-durable consumer
goods as well.
   Output of construction supplies fell for the second consecutive
month, dropping 0.3 percent following a 0.1 percent decline in
June, reflecting a strike in the lumber industry.
   Overall, manufacturing production rose 0.8 percent in July with
durable manufacturing and non-durable manufacturing posting
identical 0.8 percent increases.
   Production at utilities rose 0.6 percent on top of a giant 2.5
percent increase in June. The big gains were attributed to high
demand for electricity during the summer heat wave.
   Output at the nation's mines, including oil and gas drilling
activities, rose 0.6 percent in July. This sector is now producing
at a rate 4.9 percent higher than a year ago.
   Total output stood at 137.7 percent of its 1977 base of 100 and
is 5.4 percent higher than a year ago.

<HEAD>PLO Says Jordan Will Avoid Further Pullout From West Bank</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: New throughout with PLO delegation going to Egypt, Israeli
commentary, editing to trim. No pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Visiting PLO officials said Jordan agreed
to maintain its remaining ties with the Israeli-occupied West Bank,
including the granting of Jordanian passports to residents and
maintaining open bridges across the Jordan River.
   The PLO officials, ending three days of talks with this
kingdom's leadership, repeated a call for an eventual confederation
with Jordan in a Palestinian state.
   The talks, which ended Sunday, were the first between top PLO
and Jordanian officials since King Hussein announced two weeks ago
that he was severing legal and administrative ties with the West
Bank.
   The delegation arrived in Egypt today for talks with President
Hosni Mubarak.
   A top PLO representative at the talks, Abdullah Horani, said the
two sides had ``passed over'' irritation his group felt because it
was not consulted before Hussein's announcement.
   Hussein challenged the Palestine Liberation Organization to
create a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
captured by Israel during the 1967 Middle East war.
   The territories have been plagued by an 8-month-old Palestinian
rebellion, during which more than 240 Palestinians and four
Israelis have died.
   In the days preceding and following his speech, the Jordanian
monarch canceled a $1.3 billion West Bank development plan, fired
thousands of civil servants there and ended West Bank
representation in Jordan's parliament.
   The moves prompted speculation that Hussein might be trying to
set up the PLO for failure or pressuring it into admitting it needs
Jordan to achieve a Palestinian state.
   In a communique issued late Sunday, the PLO delegation praised
Hussein's moves in the West Bank, which he ruled from 1948 to 1967.
It said Jordan had agreed to maintain current ties to the West Bank.
   Horani told reporters those ties included the granting of
Jordanian passports to West Bank residents, maintaining open
bridges across the Jordan River, supervision of West Bank schools
and economic links. Jordan om serves as a lifeline to the West Bank
by handling exports and funneling in money.
   A Jordanian statement after the meeting made no direct mention
of those links or any agreement relating to them. It said only that
the two sides agreed ``that the national unity between both sides
is a stronghold'' and pledged continued support for the Palestinian
cause.
   Jordan has long had uneasy relations with the PLO, and it fought
in 1970-71 to expel Palestinian commandos from its territory.
   Most of the 850,000 West Bank residents and many of the 650,000
residents of the Gaza Strip hold Jordanian passports, although Gaza
was under Egyptian control until 1967.
   Hussein's recent moves have caused anxiety among West Bank
residents as well as Jordanians of Palestinian origin, who are in
the majority in Jordan. They fear their rights in Jordan might be
curtailed.
   The PLO statement Sunday said the kingdom ``made clear Jordan's
decision that Jordanians of Palestinian origin are Jordanian
citizens and have full rights of citizenship and full duties.''
   Also Sunday, a senior PLO leader was quoted as saying the PLO is
seriously considering creating a provisional government that would
recognize Israel's right to exist.
   The weekly Journal du Dimanche quoted Salah Khalaf, PLO chief
Yasser Arafat's main deputy in the Fatah guerrilla group, as
saying: ``My solution for peace is for a Palestinian state, a
discussion to establish the borders of this state and mutual
recognition of Israel and Palestine.''
   Khalaf was quoted as saying, ``We are thinking seriously of
creating a Palestinian state with a provisional government,
legitimately established, whose political program would be
completely different from the PLO's current charter.'' He gave no
details.
   The 20-year-old charter calls for replacement of the Jewish
state with a ``democratic secular state.'' It has been a roadblock
to U.S. and Israeli relations with the PLO.
   The Khalaf interview received wide media coverage in Israel, and
the daily Hadashot said today that it might herald a significant
change in the PLO, which Israel has banned as a terrorist group.
   ``We can't ignore what is happening to the PLO today,'' the
paper said in an editorial. It said a move by the PLO to set up a
government recognizing Israel ``could change the status quo ... The
argument that `we don't speak to the PLO' loses its force when we
are talking about an organization which claims it is ready to
negotiate on the basis of mutual recognition.''
   Khalaf said a decision might be taken by the Palestine National
Council at its meeting next month in Algeria.

   Twelve people have lived in a house converted
into a church for more than seven months awaiting a tornado they
believe will strike the area.
   They have put jobs, educations and families on hold since Jan. 3
and leave the Repairer of the Breach Church of God in Christ only
to purchase food and supplies.
   The tornado shall ``kill many but spare the righteous,'' said
Annie Sims, wife of the church's pastor, Elder M.L. Sims.
   Since Mrs. Sims' prophesy in December, five people have been
removed from the church by court order.
   Rushell Harris, a teacher, and her 16-year-old daugther were
taken from the church for psychiatric treatment after complaints by
relatives. They were found mentally fit and returned to the church.
   Mancy Scott, 51, was forced to leave for kidney dialysis after
friends and medical authorities got a court order. He later moved
in with relatives.
   Lake County Welfare Department officials removed two boys, ages
12 and 13, for not attending school and placed them in foster case.
State law requires children to attend classes until age 16.
   ``God will take care of it all,'' Sims said recently. ``We will
stay here until it (the tornado) comes.''
   Sims' wife had prophesied the tornado would come Jan. 3, and
when it didn't, she predicted it would hit Jan. 24. When it failed
to appear, Sims said God delayed the twister because he wanted more
people to know about it.
   Sims refused to say how he and the other congregation members
survive financially.
   Johnnie Mae Walker, Harris' sister-in-law, said Harris ``saved a
lot of her money. My niece also receives $600 a month from Social
Security. They could be using that to live on.''

   Despite calls for continued
anti-government demonstrations, returning travelers reported calm
in Burma's capital today. Analysts predicted few dramatic changes
in its authoritarian system.
   Legislative and political party meetings are scheduled on
Friday, presumably to choose a successor to President Sein Lwin,
who resigned last week after violent nationwide demonstrations.
   Travelers returning from Rangoon said throngs of people waited
to withdraw money from the National Bank and others read a list of
the dead and wounded pasted at the entrance of Rangoon General
Hospital.
   ``There were heaps of names,'' said Kate Meehan, a teacher from
Sydney, Australia. On another wall was a cartoon showing a headless
president and vice president with the caption in Burmese reading,
``Burma is being run by no one.''
   By official count, at least 95 people were killed and 240 people
wounded in last week's protests. Unconfirmed reports say hundreds
of people were killed.
   Travelers quoted Burmese as saying they were anxiously awaiting
the Friday party meetings.
   ``There are many things to be done by the new president,'' an
Italian tourist, Antonella Mantica, quoted residents as saying.
   Sein Lwin was widely held responsible for ruthless suppression
of dissent over the past quarter century.
   Leaflets over the weekend had called for more protests for full
democracy from the government, and Japan's Kyodo News Agency had
reported that demonstrations were set for today. But the returning
travelers and Burma's official Radio Rangoon reported no protests.
   In a Bangkok conference on Burma, analysts predicted few
dramatic changes from the 26-year authoritarian rule of Ne Win.
   ``Ne Win will probably pick a second Sein Lwin who will not be
such a hardliner but still do everything commanded by Ne Win,''
said Zaw Wai, a Burma-born businessman and a spokesman for the
large Burmese emigre community in Bangkok.
   Chayachok Chulsiriwongse, a Thai expert on Burma, said he
believed former strongman Ne Win remained as the ``elder
statesman,'' working behind the political scenes.
   Ne Win was succeeded as chairman of the Burma Socialist Program
Party on July 26 by Sein Lwin, a retired army general.
   On July 30, Burma detained 10 people, including a prominent
government critic, Gen. Aung Gyi. Also detained was Sein Win, the
Burmese correspondent of The Associated Press.
   Chayachok and others said a successor to Sein Lwin might be more
acceptable to some Burmese but would be picked from among the top
military or retired military officers who were part of the former
Ne Win hierarchy.
   Students demands have included a multi-party system, restoration
of basic human rights, the release of political prisoners and the
right to set up their own organizations.
   Burma's state-owned official media meanwhile said leaders of
student demonstrations are promising ``to avoid similar acts in the
future.''
   The Guardian newspaper said in its editorial today that it was
``satisfying to see the situation in Rangoon improving day after
day.''

   A man murdered his estranged wife and her
boyfriend by crashing his vehicle into their car, police said.
   Wesley R. Heckman, 44, ``was holding and cradling his dead
wife,'' when police arrived, Macon County sheriff's Lt. Roger
Walker said Sunday.
   Heckman was jailed on $500,000 bond on two counts each of murder
and reckless homicide.
   Linda Heckman, 44, and Michael R. Roberts, 35, died Friday when
their car was forced off a highway and overturned several times
south of Elwin, Walker said.
   Sheriff Lee Holsapple said Heckman confronted his estranged wife
when she got off work at St. Mary's Hospital, and chased her and
Roberts at speeds up to 90 mph.
   ``He had been ramming the car here in town,'' Walker said. ``He
chased them out of town and rammed them again.''

<TEXT>
   The rebel brother of Afghan President
Najib said today the communist leader knows he cannot rule
Afghanistan without help from Soviet troops.
   Najib's brother Siddiquallah, 35, met with reporters for the
first time since defecting to Moslem guerrillas 11 months ago. He
arrived in this Pakistani border town this month, reportedly to
seek political asylum in the West.
   ``He (Najib) knows he cannot rule Afghanistan without the
Soviets,'' Siddiquallah told a news conference at the
heavily-guarded headquarters of the Afghan Guerrilla Alliance.
   The news conference was timed to coincide with the Aug. 15
deadline for Moscow's withdrawal of half of its estimated 100,000
troops in Afghanistan. The deadline was set in a U.N.-brokered
accord in April.
   The Kremlin said it had met its deadline. Military officials
said their troops remained only in a few Afghan provinces, mainly
from the capital, Kabul, to the north.
   The rest of the Soviet troops are to be out by Feb. 15, 1989.
The Kremlin began its pullout in May.
   Some Western, Pakistani and guerrilla sources have predicted
Kabul's Communist government will fall quickly after the Soviet
troops leaves. A former Soviet military adviser in Afghanistan,
Maj. Gen. Kim M. Tsagolov, has expressed doubt the Afghan army can
hold its own after the pullout.
   Siddiquallah refused to comment on whether he was seeking asylum
in a third country. But guerrillas who harbored him said he was
trying to obtain entry to the United States.
   The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad declined comment on the report.
   Siddiquallah said he was a committed member of the Communist
Party in the late 1960s, but grew disillusioned over the next
decade as the party became the People's Democratic Party of
Afghanistan.
   The party seized power in a bloody 1978 coup, sparking
widespread Moslem resistance. Soviet troops intervened in December
1979, replacing one communist regime with another.
   Sidiquallah said he tried to escape to the West in 1981 but was
drugged in West Germany and hauled back to Afghanistan.
   He said Najib, 43, a physician and former chief of the Afghan
state security police, had him imprisoned in 1987 after failing to
squelch his criticism of the government. He was released a few
months later.
   Siddiquallah said he defected to the Moslem guerrillas in
September 1987.

   Showers and thunderstorms fell on much of the nation today after
damaging winds whipped through southern New England and the Ohio
Valley.
   The storms extended this morning from western New York across
northern Ohio, southern Michigan and northern Indiana, over Florida
and southern Georgia, east, central Louisiana, northeastern North
Dakota and central Arizona.
   A tornado Sunday ripped the roof from a gas station and uprooted
trees in St. Petersburg, Fla., and rough weather from a dying
tropical depression pounded much of Florida. No injuries were
reported.
   On Sunday evening, thunderstorm winds extended from east,
central New York across New Hampshire and northern Massachusetts.
Winds reached 71 mph at Buffalo, N.Y., and damaged trees and power
lines near Hamlin, N.Y.
   In Michigan, winds gusted to near 60 mph across northern
Kalamazoo County. Severe thunderstorms in the state's southern
Lower Peninsula unleashed a tornado that leveled two barns, killed
15 cows and knocked out electricity to thousands, including state
police. There were no injuries.
   This morning, thunderstorm gusts reached 55 mph over northern
Ohio, 60 mph near Lagrange, Ind., and near 60 mph at Tucson, Ariz.
   Heavier rainfall early today included more than an inch at
Lansing, Mich., and Miami.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms extending
through northern New England and northern New York along the South
Carolina and Georgia coast over Florida across the lower Texas Gulf
Coast and over central Arizona.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 90s for much of the
nation; in the 60s and 70s through northern New England and the
central coast of California; in the 70s across much of Washington;
in the 70s and 80s over the rest of northern New England, much of
New York and around Lake Superior; in the 70s and 80s over the
northern plateau, the Great Basin and the Southern Plateau; in the
upper 90s to about 105 degrees over the Plains and the central
Mississippi Valley; and near 110 through the desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 44
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 89 degrees at
Phoenix, Ariz.

<HEAD>`French Connection' Cop Here to Make Film on Missing Heroin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former detective who was the
basis for Gene Hackman's character in ``The French Connection''
says he's making a sequel on how heroin seized in the bust was
later stolen from New York police vaults.
   The tale will unfold in a two-hour, $8 million movie Eddie Egan
plans to start filming in Fort Lauderdale in the fall, he said.
   Egan's role in helping crack the French Connection heroin
trafficking scheme was portrayed in the 1971 Academy Award-winning
movie, in which Hackman played a character named Jimmy ``Popeye''
Doyle.
   Now, Egan wants to tell the rest of the story _ how 112 pounds
of heroin he and his partner recovered in 1962 were discovered
missing a decade later from the police property clerk's office and
ended up on the streets of southern Florida.
   ``It was what I have to term as the perfect crime,'' Egan said.
``Nobody was watching the store.''
   He said the film, ``Internal Affair,'' will show how criminals
got on the police force and over several years smuggled heroin out
of Police Department vaults, replacing it with worthless powder.
   Egan has formed a movie company, Gold Shield Productions Inc.,
to produce ``Internal Affair,'' which he bills as being more
intriguing than ``The French Connection.''
   The stars have not been selected, but Egan said they must have a
drug-free background.
   The French Connection arrests capped an investigation filled
with tedious surveillance and routine police work. It was the
highlight of Egan's 20-year police career.
   After the arrests, Egan was demoted and suspended for failing to
catalog drugs seized as evidence. He retired in 1971 to make movies.
   Egan, 58, has spent the past 15 years as a character actor in TV
and movie police stories such as ``Badge 373,'' ``Police Story,''
``Prime Cut'' and ``Joe Forrester.''

   Guerrillas took a key provincial capital in
Afghanistan and a district near Kabul as the Soviet pullout neared
its halfway mark, state-run media said today in reports indicating
Red Army troops now are deployed only along escape routes.
   The official Tass news agency, the Communist Party daily Pravda
and Radio Moscow today heralded the Soviet fulfillment of an
agreement signed in Geneva in April that required the Kremlin to
pull out half of its more than 100,000 soldiers by Aug. 15.
   Afghanistan's Radio Kabul reported Sunday that halfway point was
reached over the weekend when a motorized rifle regiment of 200
vehicles and 3,000 troops left for the Soviet Union from the
western city of Herat.
   Those Soviets still in Afghanistan must leave the war-torn
country within six months, according to the Geneva agreements.
   Pravda carried an article by Afghan leader Najib in which he
thanks the Kremlin for its support during the war that has divided
Afghanistan since the April 1978 revolution.
   Soviet troops intervened in December 1979 to support a
pro-Moscow regime.
   The article was accompanied by a graphic showing where the
remaining Soviet soldiers are deployed. It indicates Kremlin troops
are located only along two evacuation routes to the Soviet border,
from Kabul in the northeast and from Shindand via Herat in the west.
   Soviet military officials have said the pullout cleared Soviets
from 25 of Afghanistan's 30 provinces, and the graphic accompanying
Najib's article showed soldiers are deployed in only a narrow
ribbon through the remaining five provinces.
   Tass said in the dispatch from Kabul that guerrilla activity is
the rise:
   ``In the first 10 days of August, extremists carried out 142
bombardments and attacks on populated areas around the country. As
a result, 31 peaceful residents were killed and 113 wounded.''
   Tass said two guerrilla groups, the Islamic Party of Afghanistan
and the Islamic Society of Afghanistan, had captured the Skakardar
district about 20 miles north of Kabul. It said the groups had a
supply of 1,500 rockets they planned to fire at the Afghan capital.
   The news agency said rebels were planning to send other forces
to districts of the Kabul province to put further pressure on the
capital.
   Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov, commander of Soviet forces in
Afghanistan, on Sunday confirmed Western reports that the northern
provincial capital of Kunduz had fallen to the rebels.
   He contended he had ``no doubt that in the very near future''
the Soviet-backed government would retake the strategic northern
city.
   Kunduz, which lies beyond the Hindu Kush mountains north of
Kabul, was a government stronghold until late 1986, when
U.S.-supplied Stinger missiles were brought to the mountainous area
by the rebels and used to down numerous Soviet and Afghan planes.
   It is located near a five-province northern zone created earlier
this year in which Afghan officials appear to be establishing an
economic buffer zone between the rebel-controlled southern
provinces and the Soviet border.
   The mountainous region north of Kabul and east of the strategic
economic area, where Afghanistan's best natural resources are
concentrated, has been repeatedly harassed by guerrillas over the
past year. Rebels hiding in the hills and mountains through which
the Kabul evacuation route traverses have used their higher vantage
points to fire on the departing Soviet convoys.
   Soviet media have not disclosed the number of troops killed or
wounded during the pullout, which began May 15.
   Officials of the Afghan government say their armed forces were
capable of defending the country without Soviet troops. But some
Western, Pakistani and guerrilla sources have predicted Kabul's
communist government will fall soon after the Soviet soldiers are
gone.
   Reports reaching Islamabad, Pakistan, said almost all provincial
capitals remain in the Afghan government's control. However,
guerrillas control most of the rural countryside and have made
repeated seizures of the cities.
   They have been forced out of the provincial capitals by heavy
Soviet aerial bombardment.

   Thousands of Roman Catholic pilgrims
prayed today at a church here in preparation for a service tonight
that many expect to bring miracles of healing.
   Officials estimate more than 20,000 people have journeyed from
across the country to worship at St. John Neumann Catholic Church.
   About 5,000 people attended the first of five rosary services
this morning. Hundreds camped out overnight on a grassy hillside
outside the church, many bringing pillows, coolers and beach
umbrellas. The temperature was expected to hit near 100 degrees
today.
   On Sunday night, a Mass and rosary service was moved outdoors to
accommodate about 2,500 people. Worshipers crowded onto the grassy
slope beneath a huge altar built atop the church office for the
weekend of worship and prayer.
   Rosary services at St. John Neumann, a church built underground,
became the focus of nationwide attention after three parishioners
claimed to have received messages from the Virgin Mary during
weekly rosaries.
   The three, Mike Slate, Mary Constancio and Theresa Werner, said
that Mary told them to expect a miracle on today's Feast of the
Assumption, the day Catholics celebrate the ascension of Mary into
heaven.
   Mrs. Constancio, a former hospital therapist, said she and her
husband quit their jobs to spend more time praying.
   While many handicapped people have come to the church hoping for
physical healing, others said they seek spiritual renewal.
   Roberto Garcia, his wife, niece and 11-year-old son drove from
Fort Morgan, Colo., and attended Sunday's Mass.
   ``My son has been sick a long time,'' Garcia said. ``Last year I
had to carry him in my arms. Now he can walk, but he's still sick.''
   ``Maybe my son can get better,'' he said.
   Cindy Lewis of Miami said she came to strengthen her faith.
``Like they said in church, that so many people would come here to
pray together is a miracle,'' she said. ``It really doesn't matter
what happens.''
   The throng of worshipers Sunday sparked concern from officials
about crowd control for the evening service. Parking lots
surrounding the church were full with the morning Mass crowd, which
police estimated at about 1,300.
   ``I've seen people leave their car in the middle of traffic if
they're late for a (football) kickoff,'' said police Col. Ray
Huffman. ``You can just imagine what would happen if they're late
for a miracle.''

<TEXT>
   The first shark patrols in six
years continue off Stinson Beach after a great white shark was seen
eating a seal.
   Sharks may be entering the area to feed on sick or dead sea
lions and seals, which have been stricken in an epidemic of a
kidney disease, said Dr. Ray Deiter, a veterinarian with Coast
Watch, which monitors marine mammal life.
   Last week a surfer survived a shark attack near Eureka, about
300 miles north of Stinson, a popular beach just north of San
Francisco.
   Lifegaurds are cruising the area once or twice a day for signs
of sharks, said lifeguard Steve Hills. No sharks have been spotted,
he said.
   The patrols began Wednesday after a fisherman reported seeing a
shark more than 13 feet long feeding about 300 yards off shore,
Hills said. The beach will remain open unless a shark is spotted
closer in, he said.
   No one has ever been attacked by a shark at Stinson, Hills said.

<TEXT>
   The Legislature today began the sixth day
of a special session called to abolish a century-old system of
local government purchasing, a reform prompted by an FBI probe of
corruption.
   The House and Senate reconvened this morning in an effort to
settle differences that deadlocked conferees late Sunday night.
   Rep. H.L. ``Sonny'' Merideth said he would recommend today that
the Legislature adjourn and go home.
   ``I'm sure the House will be disappointed as I know the Senate
would,'' Merideth said. ``But the House's position is that unless
you can get something that is reasonable and workable and doesn't
have the potential to self-destruct, we can wait until another day
for a better bill.''
   Senate negotiators had no immediate comment.
   The 1988 legislative session ended in May with conferees failing
to agree on reform legislation.
   Gov. Ray Mabus remained optimistic. ``We're of the belief that
nobody is interested in going home without resolving the matter,''
Mabus' spokesman Cliff Treyens said.
   The FBI's Operation Pretense probe resulted in the arrests of 52
supervisors in 24 counties. Forty-three were convicted or pleaded
guilty and 23 received prison sentences. The charges ranged from
extortion to mail fraud.
   The House has approved a bill that would require counties to
adopt central purchasing systems.
   Currently, county supervisors oversee all purchasing in their
districts. The new system would give an appointed administrator
power over day-to-day purchasing for the entire county, while
keeping policy in the hands of supervisors.
   Supervisors would still award contracts, but the administrator
would be responsible for purchasing materials and overseeing
projects.
   The Senate wants to exempt some small counties from the new
plan, arguing they can't afford to hire an administrator. The House
wants no exemptions.
   As state auditor for the four years before he was elected
governor in 1987, Mabus assisted the FBI in its investigation.

<HEAD>Early Arrivals Promised Cool Reception At Superdome</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Republicans, whose only task this week is
to take a foregone conclusion to a foot-stomping anti-climax, found
it necessary today to hold a morning session to start things off.
   This is what they meant by ``Morning in America''?
   There even were delegates in the cavernous Superdome when the
opening gavel fell at 10 a.m., attracted possibly by the routine
business at hand but more likely because the Superdome is the
coolest place in town. The weather in New Orleans is such that
flies have been known to faint from the heat.
   Did the morning session really count since Dan, Tom and Peter
were not peering down from their anchor booths?
   The program, to be charitable, seemed to have come out of files
marked ``Not Ready for Prime Time,'' or, ``America, Isn't It
Wonderful?''
   The schedule was drawn to pay homage to Japanese-Americans,
Hispanic-Americans, College Americans, Black Americans, Teen-age
Americans Female Americans, Jewish-Americans and Americans Abroad.
There also was a salute to youth.
   All this in barely two hours along with the call to order, two
ROTC color guards, the national anthem, the invocation and the
pledge of allegiance led by Soviet expatriate comic Yakov Smirnoff.
   He was introduced by party chairman Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., as
a man who came to the United States seeking freedom and ``like so
many Americans has given more than he received _ he's given us the
gift of laughter.''
   Smirnoff did his stint and ended with his trademark, ``What a
Country!''
   The best-known of the speakers were Alexander Haig, the former
secretary of state who made it almost to the first primary before
dropping out of the presidential race, and former Gov. Pete du Pont
of Delaware, who pocketed two delegates in the first primary and
then gave up.
   For their efforts, the two men were penciled in for 10:40 a.m.
to 11 a.m., which is about as far out of the spotlight as you can
get at a political convention.
   Maureen Reagan, the outspoken daughter of President Reagan and a
Republican Party stalwart, didn't fare much better: she had an
early starting time, when she could be as blunt as she likes
without offending too many.
   This was all a warm-up for the big finale at high noon: speeches
by candidates for the Senate and House from Virginia, New Jersey,
Tennessee, North Dakota, Vermont, Montana, New York and New Mexico.
   A far piece from prime time? Yes. But you can bet that their
campaign commercials will take full advantage of those clips of
glory. Without showing the clock, of course.

   A harbor pilot and a deck hand were
caught between two boats and slightly injured today during
preparations to guide the royal yacht Britannia with Queen
Elizabeth II on board into Aberdeen harbor, police said.
   The queen was asleep at the time of the pre-dawn accident, which
Aberdeen police said occurred in rough weather when a two-man pilot
vessel pulled alongside a motor launch near the yacht so the pilot
could transfer to the yacht.
   After the accident the pilot, William Clark, 58, was treated for
bruises at the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and released, a police
spokesman said. The deck hand, Stanley Watt, 57, suffered chest and
abdominal bruising and was kept at the hospital for observation,
the spokesman said.
   Both men were from Aberdeen, the oil capital of Europe and the
city closest to the Piper Alpha oil rig disaster last month in
which 167 men lost their lives.
   Later in the dasy, the queen and her husband Prince Philip met
40 people involved in the disaster. They then left by car for
Balmoral Castle, the royal summer retreat in the Scottish
Highlands, where they will see their fifth grandchild for the first
time.
   The Princess of York, the first child of the queen's second son
Prince Andrew and his wife Sarah, the Duchess of York, was born
Aug. 8 in London and flew with her parents to Balmoral hours after
leaving the hospital on Friday.
   The baby's name is expected to be made public after receiving
approval from the queen. The princess is fifth in line to the
throne.

   Campaigning for the Republican vice
presidential nomination reached a fever pitch today in this
convention city, as the one-man audience back in Washington _
George Bush _ declared he has still not made up his mind on a
running mate.
   The Republican nominee-to-be stuck to his vow of silence on the
choice, which he described as ``very important'' but not the
decisive factor in the fall election.
   ``No. I have not decided,'' the incumbent vice president said on
ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' ``I probably will say when I have
decided.''
   Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater said a bit later in the
morning that Bush may well have made his decision.
   ``I think he felt like going into this weekend that he had
received the input he wanted to,'' Atwater told reporters.
``Sometime over the weekend _ I include today in the weekend _ he
was going to make his decision before he got down here'' Tuesday
morning.
   Bush said he would be ``making a decision in private and then
presenting it at the appropriate time.''
   The timing for Bush's announcement of his choice may be moved up
from Thursday morning. A source said aides are discussing unveiling
the choice Wednesday night, with Bush and his running mate coming
to the Superdome after Bush formally wins the presidential
nomination that evening.
   Asked if he were leaning toward one person, Bush said: ``Yes, of
course _ but some people I'd say.''
   He brushed aside suggestions from Sen. Gordon Humphrey of New
Hampshire that conservatives could be upset by his decision.
   ``I think my choice will be widely accepted _ when I decide on
who that choice is,'' he said on NBC's ``Today'' show.
   But at the moment, the choice is a mystery, the only one left as
the delegates gathered in the Superdome today for the convention's
start.
   The woman and men on the list of contenders were waiting for the
telephone call from Bush, even as they rushed from reception to
interview to rallies amid the trappings of full-fledged campaigns.
   Those thought to be under consideration included Sen. Bob Dole
of Kansas, Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, Sen. Dan Quayle of
Indiana, former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole, former
White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker and Attorney General
Richard Thornburgh.
   Kemp of New York made it crystal clear he wants the job, even as
others took a different tack.
   ``If I were to be asked, I would be a terrific campaigner, and a
terrific candidate and a terrific vice president,'' Kemp said
today. ``But I came here not expecting it, I don't expect it today,
I'm not sitting by the telephone.''
   ``I do not expect to be asked to be vice president. ... I do
expect to help,'' said Mrs. Dole on ``CBS This Morning.''
   Others joked about the call to come.
   ``Communication is very important. In fact, if the system breaks
down, nobody will get a call and Bush will run alone,'' joked Sen.
Dole.
   With both him and his wife on the list of possibilities, their
telephone is especially crucial.
   ``We finally had to leave Washington to come down here so we got
a recording on the machine at home, just in case they got the wrong
number. It just says, `I accept,''' Dole said at a breakfast.
   Quayle, on his way to speak to the Ohio delegation, told
reporters: ``I haven't gotten any phone calls _ except from home.''
   Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming tried to take himself off the list,
saying, ``I would be a liability for George'' in an interview on
NBC's ``Meet the Press'' on Sunday.
   But Bush said today that such public statements from prospects
may not indicate he has taken them off his private list. ``I
wouldn't say that at all,'' he said on NBC, ``I haven't made up my
mind yet.''
   Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, mentioned as a
possibility, flew out of the city Sunday, saying ``If I'm on
anyone's list, it's a list no one's told me about.''
   But Tennessee still was not out of the running. Republican
insiders have been urging Bush to consider former White House Chief
of Staff Baker. The former Tennessee senator was due here today.
   The choice may not be any of these, warned New Jersey Gov.
Thomas Kean, a friend of the vice president. After talking to Bush
on Saturday, Kean said the vice president is thinking about some
other names.
   ``I know there are some people who have not been on those lists
who are still in his mind, so it could be a surprise,'' said Kean,
who will give the convention keynote speech on Tuesday night.
   Dole and Domenici denied seeking the No. 2 spot, while Kemp had
a campaign mini-rally attended by former presidential hopeful Pete
du Pont.

<TEXT>
   The governor has asked state officials to
review a program that has allowed John Zaccaro Jr. to spend his
four-month prison term for selling cocaine in a $1,500-a-month
luxury apartment with maid service.
   Gov. Madeleine Kunin feels the overall program is outstanding
but ``believes people should be treated equally regardless of
personal circumstances,'' spokesman Louis Berney said today.
   The son of former vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro
is staying in one of 12 units in a building designed for
expense-account business people on short assignments, the New York
Daily News reported Sunday.
   Zaccaro, 24, was convicted in April of selling a quarter-gram of
cocaine to an undercover police officer while a student at
Middlebury College in 1986. Judge Francis McCaffrey sentenced him
to four months in prison.
   Zaccaro was determined eligible for the state Corrections
Department's ``house arrest'' program, under which non-violent
convicts can find their own housing and live under supervision by
corrections officials.
   His apartment comes with maid service and cable TV, among other
amenities, the Daily News said.
   ``We like to think of it as a cross between an apartment and a
hotel, with the advantages of both,'' a spokeswoman for the
building's owners told the newspaper.
   Addison County State's Attorney John Quinn, who prosecuted
Zaccaro, said of Zaccaro's accommodations, ``This guy is a drug
felon and he's living in conditions that 99.9 percent of the people
of Vermont couldn't afford.''
   With the attention on the luxuries of the apartment, it is
important to remember Zaccaro ``does not have freedom in any sense
of the word,'' Berney said.
   ``He works most of the time, and is restricted to his apartment
for the rest of the time, with the exception of one hour a week in
which he has to go grocery shopping.''
   ``The department doesn't provide the apartment,'' said John
Perry, director of planning for corrections. ``The prisoner does
that. We are only concerned that it meets minimum standards _ no
drugs, no guns, no college kids hanging around.
   ``Obviously, some people Mr. Zaccaro among them, have more money
than others, and they can afford a better place. The Aga Khan
probably wouldn't think much of his apartment. It's a matter of
standards of living. And we are not paying for it so we can't
decide a place is too luxurious if it meets the other criteria.''
   Corrections officials, however, did say there was concern that
dissatisfaction in the law enforcement community with the
comfortable way in which Zaccaro is serving time may threaten the
future of the house arrest program.
   ``It's a disgrace to put a drug dealer into the program,'' Quinn
said. ``I'm not happy about it and neither are other state's
attorneys.''

   A gang of armed men entered a home, then
shot and killed a family of 13 in their beds, officials reported
Monday.
   Police said the massacre was part of a battle by armed gangs for
control of isolated villages in Pakistan's southern Sind province.
   Sind has been the scene of ethnic violence involving native
Pakistanis and Moslems who left India after its independence in
1947. The unrest has claimed scores of lives in Sind in the past
two months.
   The gang members apparently suspected the head of the murdered
family _ including five women and two children _ of being a
government informer, said the officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.

<HEAD>Army to Build Electrified Fence Along Botswana Border</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The army plans to erect a
14-mile electrified fence along a section of the Botswana border
following renewed complaints of guerrilla infiltrations.
   Military headquarters said the fence would be built near the
Pontdrif border station in far-northern Transvaal province.
Pontdrif is close to the point where the borders of South Africa,
Botswana and Zimbabwe intersect.
   There have been several encounters in the area in recent weeks
between South African security forces and alleged guerrillas of the
outlawed African National Congress, including a shootout in which a
suspected guerrilla and a policeman were killed.
   The government has reiterated charges that Botswana is major
infiltration route for guerrillas entering South Africa to carry
out sabotage and bombings.
   South Africa two years ago erected an electrified fence along a
section of its border with Mozambique, primarily to cut down on the
number of Mozambicans entering South Africa illegally. Through
February, 46 people had been killed trying to scale the 36-mile,
high-voltage fence.
   Six people have been killed from contact with a shorter
electrified fence on a section of the Zimbabwe border in 1985.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II closed the Roman Catholic
Church's Marian Year on Monday with a Mass in St. Peter's Basilica,
exhorting the Virgin Mary to help fight ``the threats which hang
over the entire great human family.''
   About 20,000 people crowded the church for the solemn 2{-hour
ceremony on the Feast of the Assumption, which marks the day the
Virgin Mary was received into heaven.
   The ceremony, broadcast to 24 countries on four continents,
concluded the Marian Year, a period designated by the Polish-born
pontiff for special devotion to the mother of Jesus. The period
began on Pentecost Sunday, June 7, 1987.
   Sunday's liturgy was celebrated in the traditional Latin rite,
but also included chants, hymns and prayers in 16 languages,
including Albanian, Arabic, Russian and Swahili.
   ``Oh Mother ... be always with your children,'' John Paul said
in his homily in Italian. ``Help man, people, nations and humanity
to rise up. Such a cry of the Marian Year resonated in various
places in the world ... which feels in a particularly acute way the
threats which hang over the entire great human family.
   He also underscored the urgency of his last encyclical, ``Social
Concern of the Church,'' which called for action against economic
and social injustices in the world.
   In a separate message at the end of the service, the pontiff
looked ahead to the third millennium.
   ``Today, let us trustfully place the goal of the year 2000 and
the prospects for the third millennium under the watchful
intercession of the Virgin Mary, sister and mother of the church,''
John Paul said.
   The ceremomy also included liturgies from the Eastern churches,
with hymns sung by Syrian, Greek, Albanian and Coptic-rite monks.
One Ethiopian group chanted African songs to the beat of tribal
drums. A group of Sicilian girls in traditional costumes threw
thousands of rose petals on an altar representing the tomb of Mary.
   The Vatican has said Catholics can gain indulgence, or the
pardon of temporal punishment for sin, by devoutly participating in
seminars and special pilgrimages to mark the Marian Year.
   In conjunction with the Marian Year, the pope is scheduled to
release in the next few weeks a major document on the role of women
in society and the church.

   A team of Soviet missile experts
left Frankfurt on Monday after spending the weekend inspecting U.S.
nuclear rocket sites in West Germany, a spokesman for the U.S.
Rhein-Main Air Base said.
   The Soviet team of 40 inspectors arrived in West Germany on
Friday and visited four U.S. nuclear bases on Saturday and Sunday.
   The inspections are part of the treaty signed in December by
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Under the pact, the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to
allow on-site inspections of their missile bases to ensure
compliance with the terms of the treaty.
   The Soviets inspected U.S. Pershing 2 bases at Neu-Ulm and
Neckarsulm, both in southern Germany. They also visited a Pershing
2 storage site at Weilerbach, west of Mannheim, and a missile
maintenance site in Hausen, a suburb of Frankfurt.
   It was the second Soviet on-site inspection in West Germany.
   In July, a team of 19 Soviet missile specialists visited a
Pershing 2 site in Mutlangen and a cruise missile base in
Hasselbach.
   There are six bases in West Germany with a total of 220
medium-and shorter-range missiles covered by the treaty.
   So far this year, Soviet inspections have been conducted at U.S.
military sites in West Germany, the United States, Britain, Belgium
and the Netherlands. The United States has been conducting
inspections in the Soviet Union, East Germany and Czechoslovakia.

<HEAD>State High Court Nixes `Executive Privilege' On Documents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael Dukakis may not invoke ``executive
privilege'' to keep documents from the public, the Massachusetts
Supreme Court ruled today.
   The unanimous decision came in the case of two homosexual men
who are challenging the Dukakis administration's decision to remove
two young boys from foster care in their Boston home, but it could
affect other issues.
   The Democratic presidential nominee's administration has cited
``executive privilege'' in a number of areas to avoid having to
disclose internal memos and other sensitive papers. Opponents of
plans to put a new prison in New Braintree are seeking to force
disclosure of documents showing how the site was chosen.
   ``There is no such privilege in Massachusetts,'' the court said
in an opinion written by Chief Justice Edward F. Hennessey.
   The justices said they found no justification in the state
constitution or state law for withholding government documents.
They said the creation of laws, rights or privileges was a policy
issue best left to the Legislature.
   ``Had the framers of our government's structure intended to
recognize in our constitution an executive privilege, it is
reasonable to expect that they would expressly have created one,''
they said.
   ``It's a victory for accountability and open government,'' said
Anthony M. Doniger, attorney for Donald Babets and David Jean.
   ``The public now has a right to know how its government comes to
its decisions. That is a good thing in a democracy.''
   Spokesmen for Dukakis were traveling with him to central
Massachusetts and were not immediately available for comment.
   The case began in 1985, when the Dukakis administration removed
two youngsters _ then aged 3{ and 22 months _ from Babets and Jean.
After a study, the Department of Social Services promulgated rules
for placing foster children that gave lowest priority to homosexual
individuals who lacked experience as parents and gave first
priority to married couples with children.
   Babets and Jean filed suit in Suffolk Superior Court in January
1986 challenging the legality of the rules. The suit named Dukakis,
Human Services Secretary Philip Johnston and DSS Commissioner Sandy
Matava as defendants, although Dukakis was later dropped as a named
defendant.
   Babets and Jean argued that the policy discriminated and
violated their constitutional rights to equal protection, free
association and privacy.
   During the trial, lawyers for Babets and Jean asked Judge James
P. Lynch Jr. to order the Dukakis administration to divulge certain
documents relating to the policy-making process. After hearings and
an inspection of the documents Lynch ordered the government to
surrender them. But Lynch stayed his order and referred the
constitutional questions to the appellate courts.
   Today's ruling specifically affirms Lynch's order, apparently
forcing the state to release the requested documents.

   The police chief today dropped the word
``black'' from a directive ordering officers to stop and question
black teen-agers at random to reduce crime in a racially-mixed
neighborhood.
   Chief Martin Felker said in a statement that the policy, which
is under attack by a black lawyers' association in federal court,
``unfortunately ... has been perceived as racially motivated.''
   ``To correct this misconception, I have modified this
directive,'' he said. Lafayette Tolliver of the Thurgood Marshall
Law Association said the group will press ahead with its suit to
prevent police from carrying out the policy, announced July 8. The
policy applies to the Old West End neighborhood.
   A 4:30 p.m. hearing was scheduled in U.S. District Court on the
group's request for a temporary restraining order and $1 million in
damages, the attorney said.
   The association sued on Friday on behalf of Walter Wade Jr., a
black teen-ager who was followed and then stopped by police in
front of his house Wednesday. Wade, 19, was questioned but not
charged with any offense, the suit said.
   ``This policy has given police carte blanche to do what they
wanted in the Old West End. We are not only talking about black
teen-agers being stopped, but also some black adults, too,''
Tolliver said this morning.
   The policy followed complaints by residents who had reported
three violent incidents involving black youngsters. About 17
percent of Toledo's 340,000 residents are black.
   The suit said the policy violates civil rights law and the
Constitution's guarantee of freedom of association and protection
against unlawful search and seizure.
   Felker defended the policy as necessary to stop violence in the
neighborhood.

   Riot police used tear gas and beatings
Monday to disperse thousands of radical students trying to march to
the border for unification talks with North Korea. At least 1,300
were arrested.
   President Roh Tae-woo told the nation his government will not
tolerate violent campus protest. He said unchecked student activism
would endanger the Olympic Games, which open Sept. 17 in Seoul.
   Officers were seen taking away hundreds of protesters who tried
to march from Seoul to the border truce village of Panmunjom, 35
miles north of the capital, for talks with North Korean student
leaders.
   Witnesses saw dozens of protesters and policmen injured but no
injury statistics were available. Authorities said they arrested
1,300 students but released many after warnings.
   Riot police fired tear gas at Yonsei University in western Seoul
and charged into a crowd of students. They kicked protesters, beat
them and dragged about 200 away.
   In a speech marking the 43rd anniversary of Korea's independence
from Japanese colonial rule, Roh said: ``We cannot any longer
tolerate activities which destroy free democracy, our way of life,''
   He said the Olympics will bring East and the West together, and
``peoples around the world are praying for the success of the
Games. Therefore, the people and the government will not forgive
anyone who spoils the festival through mob action or the throwing
of firebombs, no matter for what plausible cause.''
   Roh delivered a similar warning Friday, accusing radical
students and dissidents of siding with North Korea and trying to
overthrow the government.
   In the speech Monday, he also proposed a summit with President
Kim Il Sung of North Korea to discuss the future of the peninsula,
which was divided at the end of World War II. Similar proposals in
the past have led nowhere, but the two Koreas are considering
parliamentary talks on easing tension.
   A few hours after the speech, thousands of radical students
rallied at Yonsei and tried to march into the streets on their way
to the border.
   Troopers in green combat fatigues and black-visored helmets
fired tear gas and charged the protesters, who shouted ``Unite the
fatherland!'' and ``Yankee go home!''
   Students who did not resist huddled in groups on the ground,
clinging to each other as policemen beat them with fists and even
riot shields.
   Senior officers hit and slapped their own men in an attempt to
stop the beatings. One commander slashed at troopers with a riding
crop.
   Many students apparently decided to let themselves be arrested,
a change from their normal tactic of violent resistance. About 100
members of the ``unification vanguard'' tied themselves together so
police would have to arrest them as a group.
   Among those detained were 12 leaders who were to have
represented South Korea at the talks Monday in Panmunjom.
   Police blocked a similar march to Panmunjom on June 10. About
3,000 radical students tried to march Monday, a much smaller number
than in June, and there was virtually no evidence of public support.
   The radicals, a small but powerful minority on campuses, have
seized on national unification in their campaign against the
government.
   South Korean authorities declared Monday's march illegal and
deployed 25,000 riot police in Seoul to stop it. They insist that
all dialogue with North Korea be conducted through government
channels.
   When their march from Yonsei was blocked Monday, students
regrouped on campus and surged out with rocks and firebombs to do
battle for an hour with about 7,000 riot police. Volleys of tear
gas were fired from armored police vans.
   About 600 protesters were arrested downtown and in other parts
of Seoul. In one confrontation in the heart of the capital, 700
students lay down on the pavement with their hands interlocked as
police charged, and 200 were taken away.
   Student leaders told a rally at Yonsei they would not stop
trying to oust the Roh government and reunite Korea. Dozens of
students cut their fingers with razors and wrote four Korean
letters meaning ``national unification'' in blood.
   They denounced the United States, saying Washington supports
military rule in South Korea, and demanded withdrawal of the 42,000
U.S. troops based here under a mutual defense treaty.

<HEAD>Estonians Told By Media of Stalin-Nazi Pact</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Estonians have been told for the first
time by state-run media of the secret agreement between Nazi
Germany and Josef Stalin that paved the way 49 years ago for Soviet
takeover of the three independent Baltic states.
   Activists who have been pressing for an independent Estonia
claim publication of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact's secret protocols
portends a change in Kremlin policy.
   ``The only normal and acceptable situation for us is complete
independence,'' Eve Parnaste, an activist with the unofficial
Estonian Independence Party, said in an interview. ``I am
personally convinced that within two years Estonia will again be an
independent country.''
   Advocates of a less-radical change say the public airing of the
pact is a long overdue result of reform, but one that will allow
open discussion of Estonia's turbulent history.
   The resurgence of nationalist feeling in Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania poses a thorny problem for Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, who also faces ethnic unrest in Armenian and Azerbaijan
and elsewhere.
   Details of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact signed on Aug. 23, 1939,
were disclosed by the newspaper Voice of the Nation on Wednesday
and Thursday, and during a Friday broadcast of Estonian Radio.
   The first official disclosure of the secret agreement in the
Estonian-language daily makes clear that the states of Estonia,
Latvia and Lithuania were forcibly occupied by Soviet troops,
according to Tallinn residents who translated part of the newspaper
report for The Associated Press.
   The disclosure has stirred up nationalist sentiments among some
Estonians, who say it nullifies Moscow's political hold on the
republic.
   Activists in the republics demonstrated last year on the 48th
anniversary of the signing of the pact, demanding that its
provisions be made public.
   Nationalist sentiment is likely to surface again on the 49th
anniversary. Ms. Parnaste and other activists said they have
notified authorities that they will demonstrate in Tallinn's
central square and lay flowers in tribute to the victims of
Stalinism.
   Thousands rallied last year on the anniversary here and in Riga,
while the memorial in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius drew about
500 people.
   Janis Liegzdins of the Latvian Club for Environmental Protection
and Ainars Vilcens of the Movement for Latvian National
Independence were in Tallinn over the weekend to meet with
activists about anniversary plans. Liegzdins said 20,000 Latvians
are expected to turn out for an unsanctioned rally in Riga on Aug.
23.
   The pact that was an official secret but generally known among
residents of the Baltic states instituted a non-aggression policy
between Moscow and Berlin while the Soviets occupied the Baltics
and Hitler invaded Poland.
   The first article about the pact was accompanied by a photograph
of Stalin toasting the agreement with its signatories, Soviet
Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov and German Foreign Minister
Joachim Ribbentrop.
   The newspapers were obtained here by The AP, and many Tallinn
residents reported hearing the radio broadcast during a popular
program Friday.
   ``For the first time people here got to know of the secret,
additional treaty between Molotov and Ribbentrop _ dividing spheres
of influence between the Soviet Union and Germany,'' said
journalist Andres Raid. ``Now, for the first time, historians admit
this was aggression.''
   Felix Undusk, a leader of the first unofficial political party
sanctioned by Communist Party officials, said many Estonians have
known for years of the secret agreement, but official airing of the
pact will allow open discussion for the first time.
   ``There was happiness that finally there has been official
recognition of this _ that they've come to this point,'' Undusk
said.
   His group, known as the Peoples Front, was formed earlier this
year to work for broader implementation of the reforms outlined by
Gorbachev.
   Undusk says his organization, which claims 60,000 members, is
not separatist but wants to give Estonians more control over their
republic's affairs.
   One prominent Tallinn resident who is familiar with the
organization's policies and supports them said the group's ultimate
aim is to return power to citizens of Estonian nationality and
close the borders to non-Estonians.
   The native population's resentment of Russian domination has
surfaced in repeated demonstrations this year, and has been
addressed to some degree by party officials.
   Estonian party leader Karl Vaino was replaced by a native
Estonian, Vajno Vaelaes. One party official, who did not want to be
identified, said Vaino is a Russian whose name orignally was Vainov.
   Party officials also lifted a 48-year-old ban on public display
of the blue, black and white flag of independent Estonia, and
growing number of residents of this capital city are sporting
ribbons and pins with the national colors. Small flags are sold at
a cooperative store in Tallinn's Old Town for about $8.40.
   The 1977 Soviet Constitution allows the population of a region
to secede from the union, although all past attempts have been
halted quickly by Moscow.
   A referendum for secession of an entire republic has never been
put to a vote. However, the unofficial political parties in Estonia
plan to present candidates for next year's contested elections to a
new governmental body, which in turn will choose the membership of
the republic's legislature and executive body, which are empowered
to present issues for public vote.

   Republicans opened their 34th national
convention today with an unusual morning session as
nominee-in-waiting George Bush revealed from afar he has narrowed
his list of potential running mates. The first order of business
was an attack on Democrat Michael Dukakis as a champion of ``the
failed liberal policies of yesterday.''
   ``What a country,'' exclaimed comedian Yakov Smirnoff after
reciting the pledge of allegiance to a surprisingly large
mid-morning gathering of delegates in the cavernous Louisiana
Superdome.
   Bush remained in Washington as President Reagan prepared a
prime-time, farewell address to Republicans who twice launched him
to landslide victories.
   ``I think the president will be very personal and the crowd
reaction may be emotional,'' said Kenneth Duberstein, the White
House chief of staff. ``It's going to be a grand salute to the
president.''
   Reagan's remarks also were intended to arouse political passions
for Bush, his loyal lieutenant.
   With Bush trailing Dukakis in most national polls, the attacks
on Democrats began early with speeches by former Secretary of State
Alexander Haig and former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont, two of the
five men Bush defeated en route to Wednesday night's nomination.
   The vice president spent his morning in a round of television
interview shows, fending off questions about his running mate.
   ``I think my choice will be widely accepted when I decide on who
that choice is,'' Bush said.
   ``I've not decided,'' Bush said. Asked if he were leaning toward
someone, Bush replied, ``Yes, of course but (toward) some people,
I'd say.'' His campaign manager, Lee Atwater, said he thought Bush
might have actually decided on someone.
   Meanwhile, the rhetoric began in earnest in New Orleans.
   ``Our party has brought America back to economic strength, and
George bush, a man with unequalled experience in government, is the
man who will put its newest ideas to work,'' said du Pont.
   Looking back at last month's Democratic convention, du Pont
said, ``The most interesting thoughts of that gathering came not
from its presidential candidate, who represents the failed liberal
policies of yesterday. No, the most interest thoughts came from the
Rev. Jesse Jackson.''
   To a bare sprinkle of applause, du Pont argued that the
Republican Party was more suited to Jackson and invited him to
switch his allegiance.
   Haig, putting aside the harsh criticism of Bush he sounded
during the primary campaign, said the vice president ``represents
safe and progressive change for America. Safe in that George Bush
will build on the solid accomplishments of the Reagan presidency.
   ``Americans know that Michael Dukakis will trash them,'' Haig
declared.
   Unlike Du Pont, Haig did not spare Jackson from criticism.
Noting that Jackson frequently says a bird needs two wings to fly,
Haig said, ``Maybe he forgot some birds with two wings cannot fly
at all, like the extinct Dodo bird that was too stupid to defend
itself or the Ostrich which prefers to live with danger by ignoring
it.''
   Amid intense speculation about Bush's running mate, former
Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole said on ``CBS This
Morning,'' ``I do not expect to be asked to be vice president.''
Her husband, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, also a prospect, said, ``I
think Elizabeth would be an excellent choice.''
   The vice president, his understudy days nearing an end, will
arrive here Tuesday, just as Reagan leaves town for a long vacation
at his California ranch. In a symbolic passing of the baton, the
two men will meet briefly at the airport before Bush heads downtown
for a big welcoming rally.
   ``It's a big moment for me. It's the culmination of a lot of
years of politics,'' Bush told one interviewer. ``It feels like
this is it.''
   Speaking about his selection of a running mate, Bush said, ``I
think it's a very important choice and there's a lot of very good
people from whom to make a selection. I think my choice will be
widely accepted when I decide on who that choice is.''
   Are people who have asked not to be considered actually off his
list? ``Well, I wouldn't say that at all. I haven't made up my mind
yet,'' Bush said.
   Aides said Bush may depart from his plan to make his decision
known on Thursday and instead unveil his choice Wednesday night,
then make a dramatic appearance before the convention _ the same
timetable Reagan employed eight years ago when he named Bush as his
vice presidential choice.
   Dole, Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana and Rep. Jack Kemp of New York
acted like they were auditioning for the job, appearing on Sunday
talk shows to bash Democratic presidential hopeful Michael Dukakis.
   Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming took himself off the list of
potential candidates, saying ``I would be a liability for George''
as a result of advocating curbs on Social Security, veterans
funding.
   The newest name in the fast-churning gossip mill was Howard
Baker, the former White House chief of staff. Republicans outside
the campaign were urging Bush to take another look at the former
Senate leader, a source said.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, sworn in only Friday, made
clear he was available. ``I have a job to do for this president and
until I've heard anything from the vice president, I'm ready to go
to work as attorney general.''
   Many delegates seemed content to wait for Bush's decision. ``It
adds a little Cajun spice to the convention,'' said Rhode Island
GOP chairman J. Michael Levesque. ``Otherwise, it would be dull.''
   This fabled party town seemed anything but dull, with delegates
packed into parties and brunches from the French Quarter to the
private homes in the fashionable Garden District. Visitors could
barely go anywhere without hearing jazz, the New Orleans anthem.
   The president, eager to pass on power to his loyal lieutenant,
used his welcoming rally Sunday to give a preview of his prime-time
convention address tonight.
   He called last month's Democratic convention in Atlanta ``the
biggest masquerade since last year's Mardi Gras.''
   ``The masquerade is over,'' Reagan said. ``It's time to talk
issues, to use the dreaded `L' word, to say the policies of our
opposition and the congressional leadership of his party are
liberal, liberal, liberal.''
   The crowd chanted ``four more years, four more years'' for the
president, a reminder of the difficulty Bush faces in trying to win
the same enthusiastic support that Reagan enjoyed in two landslide
victories.
   ``Bush is not Reagan,'' said Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho. ``I
wouldn't say he would enjoy as lopsided victories as Reagan did.''
   In the aftermath of the Democratic convention, polls showed Bush
trailing Dukakis by as much as 17 points. More recent surveys show
Bush has narrowed the gap, but his own staff believes he still is
behind by about 8 to 10 points.

   Here is the transcript of the speech by
former Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. to the Republican
National Convention on Monday.
   Mr. Chairman, fellow Republicans, ladies and gentlemen:
   I am honored to address the opening session of our party's
convention. For me, this occasion is also a reunion with my former
colleagues from the Republican primary debates. We had our
differences then, but we are all agreed on one thing now: We are
dedicated to making George Bush the next president of the United
States.
   I am confident that in November the people will choose George
Bush because he represents safe and progressive change for America,
safe in that George Bush will build on the solid accomplishments of
the Reagan presidency.
   Americans know Michael Dukakis will trash them.
   Thanks to the Reagan-Bush achievements of the past eight years,
America's international standing has been literally transformed.
When I last spoke to a Republican convention in 1980, we saw a
nation thrown off balance by blunder and gloom. The Soviets were on
the march everywhere. Afghanistan had been seized. Soviet
surrogates were triumphant in Kampuchea, Southern Africa and
Central America. A cruel war raged in the Persian Gulf, our allies
were disheartened and freedom was in retreat. And all the Democrats
could offer was indecision and malaise.
   Today, eight years later, the policy of peace through strength
has begun to pay off. The Russians are leaving Afghanistan. Their
surrogates in Africa and Asia are in trouble. The Persian Gulf
conflict is drawing to a conclusion.
   The Soviets are negotiating our arms control agenda of reduction
and cuts, designed not to increase Soviet superiority. Democracy,
not communism, is on the march. George Bush helped make this happen
and he is indeed the safe candidate for America.
   But he also knows what changes are needed to strengthen the most
successful administration in recent history. The Bush team has made
progressive change central to our party platform at this convention.
   In contrast, hard evidence confirms that Governor Dukakis is not
the candidate of safe progressive change, but the candidate of
radical and dangerous change.
   He does not believe in peace through strength. As chief
executive of the state of Massachusetts he has steadfastly refused
to permit the critical warning and communication facility _ the
Ground Wave Emergency Network (GWEN) _ to be built in his state,
leaving a serious gap in our nation's defense.
   He will turn over our global peace-keeping obligations
exclusively to international organizations _ the UN or the OAS. In
the Third World, he will resurrect the sterile policies of George
McGovern.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The second fire in three days broke out today in
the 102-story Empire State Building, this time on the 50th floor,
forcing the evacuation of dozens of office workers, the Fire
Department said.
   The fire was brought under control just after noon, about a half
hour after it was reported, but firefighters continued checking all
floors to make sure the flames hadn't spread, said department
spokesman Efrain Parrilla.
   No injuries were reported.
   The cause of the fire was not immediately known.
   The Fire Department said the blaze was in an electrical conduit
in a 50th floor stairwell. However, a building spokesman, Frank
Corbin, said the fire was in trash in a stairwell between the 51st
and 53rd floors.
   Five floors of the building's midsection were evacuated because
of heavy smoke, a spokesman for the management said.
   On Friday, a fire broke out in an 86th floor shaft. After it was
brought under control, firefighters discovered that it had climbed
to the 102nd floor. The observation decks at both those levels were
closed and some 1,500 tourists evacuated.
   That fire also put off the air for several hours eight radio
stations whose antennas are atop the building.

<BYLINE>To Recall Beatles Lyrics, Love Is Not All You Need
^By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You think you know your favorite Beatles songs,
right? But can you remember all the lyrics, and can you get all the
correct words in the correct places? Psychologists want to know.
   For example, in the song ``Rocky Raccoon,'' what comes after the
opening line: ``Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of
Dakota''? (Answer: The second line is, ``There lived a young boy
named Rocky Raccoon.'')
   Researchers asked 76 Duke University students to recall and
write down all the words to 32 Beatles songs. They were given only
the title and the first line of each.
   The purpose was to gain insight into how the mind remembers, say
researchers David Rubin of Duke and Ira Hyman of Emory University
in Atlanta.
   Half the students were assigned one group of 32 randomly chosen
songs; the others were given a different group of 32 tunes.
   Researchers analyzed the students' performance on the 25
best-remembered songs. Multiplying the number of lines in those
songs times the 38 students assigned each song gave a maximum
possible score of 16,416 recollections.
   The students achieved only 3,378 with any degree of accuracy.
   But the interesting thing, Hyman said Sunday at the annual
meeting of the American Psychological Association, is that recall
for details of the lines they remembered was remarkably good.
   Of the 3,378 lines students wrote down, they recalled 2,371
without error, 454 more with only one error and 227 with only two
errors.
   And even the flawed lines generally followed the meaning, rhythm
and poetic features of the original, suggesting people use those
characteristics to recall such material, Hyman said.
   For example, rhythm and rhyme were preserved in such errors as
remembering the phrase ``and you know you should be glad'' as ``and
you know you can't be sad,'' from the hit ``She Loves You.''
   Only four of 32 students in one group remembered that Rocky
Raccoon was carrying a gun to ``shoot off the legs of his rival.''
But some guesses were close, such as to shoot off the head or hands
or ``shoot out the lights'' of the man who stole his woman.
   Rhyming words at the end of lines were well recalled, but
sometimes there was some unintentional editing. One student turned
``wonder how you manage to feed the rest'' from ``Lady Madonna''
into ``wonder how you manage to be caressed.''
   Sometimes a flubbed phrase didn't even rhyme with the original.
``Having read the book'' from the song ``A Day in the Life'' became
``having read the play'' in one student's version.
   Other errors kept the same sounds within lines, as when the
phrase ``always know sometimes think it's me,'' from ``Strawberry
Fields Forever,'' became ``always though sometimes think it's
free.''
   In another case, from ``Yesterday,'' the line ``I said something
wrong now I long for yesterday'' became ``I must move along but I
long for yesterday.''
   And as for the student who wrote ``for efficient finger pies''
while trying to recall ``a four of fish and finger pies'' from the
song ``Penny Lane,'' maybe he just never heard it right in the
first place.

<DATELINE>CZESTOCHOWA, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cardinal Jozef Glemp on Monday
condemned abortion, pornography and sexual promiscuity in a speech
that ignored the nation's pressing social and economic problems.
   The primate's address to 150,000 pilgrims who had gathered at
the Jasna Gora monastery outside Czestochowa marked a significant
departure from sermons in recent years that have taken Poland's
communist leadership to task on a variety of issues.
   The sermon came three days after Glemp met with Polish leader
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski to discuss ways to speed up economic and
political reforms.
   Glemp made no reference to the banned trade union Solidarity,
which this month marks the eighth anniversary of the strikes that
launched the outlawed federation, but scores of red-and-white
Solidarity banners covered the iron gates below the monastery.
   A white flag with ``Solidarity'' lettered across it in red was
raised by Warsaw Solidarity activist Seweryn Jaworski. The homemade
banner flew in full view of church dignitaries seated on a
temporary outdoor platform and could be seen by the pilgrims massed
in a field below.
   Throngs of Polish pilgrims from across the nation come together
for the feast day of Our Lady of Czestochowa, regarded as Poland's
patron saint. They huddled under umbrellas for protection from the
heat, but dozens fainted.
   The 14th century monastery is the home of the Black Madonna
icon, an age-darkened painting of the Virgin Mary dating to the 8th
or 9th century which some believers credit with miraculous powers.
It is Poland's most revered religious symbol.
   In the 20-minute sermon, Glemp made no mention of the event many
Poles consider the miracle of the 20th century: the Aug. 15, 1920,
victory by Jozef Pilsudski over the Red Army in a battle known as
the ``miracle on the Vistula,'' referring to the river which cuts
through Warsaw that the Soviets failed to cross.The victory then
saved Poland from Soviet rule.
   Glemp in June attended celebrations marking the 1,000
anniversary of Christianity in the Soviet Union and he hopes to
visit the Soviet Union again, perhaps as early as this fall.
   In the past, Glemp has used the feast day sermon as an occasion
to deliver major Polish church policy statements.
   Last year, the primate urged the Polish government to work
toward establishing diplomatic relations with the Vatican. In 1986,
Glemp warned Polish leaders not to embark on a campaign to teach
atheism in the nation's schools.
   In Monday's sermon, however, Glemp followed church teachings
against abortion, pornography and sexual promiscuity, and urged the
pilgrims to practice ``sexual purity.''
   His strongest attacks were leveled against the practice of in
vitro fertilization and abortion.
   ``Every destruction of joined human cells is the killing of a
human being,'' Glemp said.
   The church estimates that 94 percent of the nation's 37.5
million people are Catholics.

   Peasants in southern China have cut down and
stolen more than 10,000 trees from a state-run forest since the
beginning of this year, an official newspaper said Monday.
   The Legal Daily said thousands of peasants have entered the
Wugong Mountain forest in Jiangxi province, felling and stealing
trees to be used in construction and for fuel. In one incident in
April, the falling trees injured forest rangers.
   The report said illegal logging has been increasing because
officials fine only the most serious offenders, while others are
asked to write self-criticisms.
   Last year, 247,100 acres of forests in China were destroyed by
illegal logging and $24.5 million in trees stolen, the China Daily
reported in March.
   In a related incident Aug. 6, about 30 farmers were injured when
they tried to stop 20,000 peasants from picking clean a field with
almost $600,000 worth of watermelons, the Legal Daily said.

   Alexander Haig, a former GOP presidential
candidate, today contrasted George Bush's ``safe and progressive''
policies with those of Michael Dukakis, whom he called the
``diminutive clerk from Massachusetts.''
   In a morning adress to the Republican National Convention, Haig
said Bush would pursue Reagan administration's policies that have
put the United States in a stronger position worldwide.
   Haig, who served as President Reagan's first secretary of state,
dropped out of the Republican presidential race on Feb. 12, four
days before the New Hampshire primary.
   At the time, he endorsed Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas for president
and made little effort to conceal his dislike of Vice President
Bush, the party's designated presidential nominee.
   Today, Haig backed Bush, saying the vice president represented
``safe and progressive change, safe in that George Bush will build
on the solid accomplishments of the Reagan presidency.''
   He said Americans are in a better position now than they were
eight years ago before Reagan was elected.
   ``When I last spoke to a Republican convention in 1980, we saw a
nation thrown off balance by blunder and gloom,'' Haig said.
``Today, eight years later, the policy of peace through strength
has begun to pay off.''
   Haig stressed the differences between Dukakis, the Massachusetts
governor chosen as the Democratic presidential nominee, and his
running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas.
   ``You have to admit Atlanta was good theater,'' Haig said,
referring to the Democrats' convention last month. ``It was an
off-Broadway revival of `The Odd Couple,' starring the diminutive
clerk from Massachusetts and the tall stranger from Texas.
   ``But when you look at the real Dukakis-Bentsen foreign
policies, you have to ask `are they running against us or against
each other?''' The two men differ on some foreign policy issues,
including military aid for the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. Dukakis
opposes the aid; Bentsen supports it.
   Haig also compared the Democratic Party to a bat ``flying
erratically for brief periods at low levels and hanging upside down
for extended periods in dark, damp caves up to its navel in guano.''

   Jack Kemp's friends gave him a football
jersey that had the number ``2'' on its back _ not the former
professional quarterback's playing number but the one of the job he
seems to be seeking.
   ``Could I be a good vice president? You bet,'' Kemp, the New
York congressman, said Monday as the Republican National Convention
was opening.
   ``I was a good second string quarterback, and I can be a good
second string quarterback for George Bush.''
   Like the rest of the convention, Kemp is awaiting Bush's word on
a running mate for the Republican ticket this fall.
   Kemp, who dropped out of the race for the Republican
presidential nomination after failing to win a primary, is taking a
highly visible role in New Orleans during the convention _ all the
while insisting he's not campaigning for the vice presidential
nomination, not expecting it, not sitting by the telephone.
   But Kemp's enthusiastically loyal conservative followers have
been campaigning on his behalf, and hundreds of them jammed a New
Orleans hotel Sunday night to cheer wildly his every word and
present the jersey to the former quarterback for the San Diego
Chargers and Buffalo Bills.
   ``Hey, my number was 15,'' he said feigning surprise.
   Speaking to reporters a day later, Kemp said he wasn't
campaigning for the job, while with his usual enthusiasm suggesting
he'd really like it.
   ``If I were to be asked, I would be a terrific campaigner, and a
terrific candidate, and a terrific vice president,'' Kemp said.
``But I came here not expecting it, I don't expect it today, I'm
not sitting by the telephone.''
   ``I'm going to campaign just as vigorously for George Bush off
the ticket as I would on the ticket,'' Kemp said.
   ``If he asks, I would want it. If he doesn't ask ...'' said
Kemp, not finishing his thought.
   Kemp, who likes to deliver a message that combines economic
conservatism with an appeal to broaden the party to include
minorities, never won more than 13 percent of the vote in the
initial Republican primaries. That was in spite of his emergence as
a favorite of many of the party's conservative wing.
   Conservative activists pushing his candidacy point to his
youthful appearance, his appeal to blacks and other minorities, and
to his background in California, where he was born and educated, as
potential boosts to the ticket.
   Some supporters acknowledge, however, that Kemp might not be
best suited to the role of a negative, attacking campaigner if that
is what the Bush campaign decides it wants in a vice president.
   Kemp suggested that himself when he said, ``I do not believe the
purpose of the vice president is to tear down, to diminish, to show
disdain, to show disrespect, to bash.''
   One leading Kemp booster around New Orleans has been Sen. Gordon
Humphrey, R-N.H., who has led a campaign pressuring Bush to pick a
running mate that is from the party's most conservative wing. Kemp
would fill that description.
   ``If Bush was watching tonight, or the Bush operatives, they'd
have to be impressed,'' Humphrey said as he left the huge reception
Kemp sponsored. ``It was almost climactic.''
   With Bush keeping silent on his choice, much of the speculation
has centered around other names. One questioner asked Kemp if it
didn't appear that Bush seemed to be suggesting he wants to pick
someone like Kemp _ but not Kemp himself.
   Kemp's answer recalled Democrat Jesse Jackson's measured
response after he was passed over for the No. 2 spot on that
party's ticket last month.
   ``I am too cool, I'm too collected, I'm too qualified to answer
that question,'' Kemp said. ``Who knows?''

<HEAD>China to Link Wage Raises With Price Rises</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China soon will give its workers a large raise
and link further pay increases to its inflation rate to stave off
growing unrest in its cities, sources said Monday.
   The move marks a step back from ambitious price reforms
undertaken in the last few years. But the plan still should be
considered a victory for liberal-minded reformers such as Communist
Party leader Zhao Ziyang, the Chinese sources said.
   The sources said Premier Li Peng, Vice Premier Yao Yilin and
other conservatives have called for a freeze on reforms which are
slowly opening the economy to market forces.
   Both sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, recently
attended meetings of top government officials in the resort town of
Bedaihe.
   The sources said the new plan to link pay with price rises would
be announced in about a month.
   ``It will allow the reforms to continue and that is the critical
point,'' said one source.
   He estimated that the average worker's annual salary of $246
would go up at least 8 percent. The other said urban workers could
be getting a 28 percent raise.
   If prices rise, they said, the workers would be given further
wage increases.
   The sources said the pay increases would replace subsidies of
about $2.70 a month that the government has been giving urban
workers to offset inflation, the highest in China's 39-year history
as a communist nation.
   Prices in June were 19 percent higher than they were in June
1987, according to the State Statistical Bureau.
   The inflation has hit urban workers the hardest. Peasants, who
make up 75 percent of China's 1.07 billion people, generally have
missed some price increases because they produce their own food.
   Inflation has been rising in China because the government has
pushed far-reaching economic reforms aimed at ending state controls
over prices and allowing the value of goods to be controlled by the
market.
   In May, the government raised the state-set prices of
vegetables, pork, sugar and eggs by about 60 percent. In late July,
it increased the price of brand-name cigarettes and spirits by as
much as 790 percent.
   The elimination of government-fixed prices has caused the cost
of some goods to soar as the economy fails to keep up with rising
consumer demand.
   In addition, interest rates in Chinese banks are much lower than
the inflation rate, so consumers want to spend now before their
money loses too much value.
   The Chinese sources said that under the plan banks will also
raise their interest rates to encourage saving. The Economic Daily
ran a front-page editorial Monday calling for such a move.
   In May, the official Xinhua News Agency quoted Li Peng and other
Chinese officials as saying riots and other signs of social turmoil
were on the increase in China.
   The sources said that in addition to placating workers, the
goverment was raising salaries to increase worker productivity.
   ``We can't continue with the reforms if the economy isn't
growing,'' said one source.
   The Chinese sources, interviewed separately, described
themselves as members of Zhao's liberal camp.

   U.S. Olympic diver Bruce David Kimball was
charged with alcohol-related manslaughter today over an auto
accident Aug. 1 that killed two teen-agers and injured six.
   Kimball, 25, a silver medalist in 1984, is in Indianapolis where
the Olympic swimming trials leading up to this year's games in
Seoul, South Korea, are being held.
   The Hillsborough State Attorney's office charged him with two
counts of manslaughter while driving under the influence of alcohol
and three counts of driving under the influence with serious
personal injuries.
   Arraignment is scheduled for Aug. 26.
   Kimball killed two teen-agers, severely injured two and hurt
four more when his speeding car plowed into a crowd at a teen-age
hangout, sheriff's deputies said.
   Kimball admitted drinking at least four beers before the
accident, according to investigators.
   State Attorney Bill James today refused to make public the
blood-acohol test. A motorist with a reading of 0.10 percent is
considered legally drunk in Florida.

<TEXT>
   Rangoon was quiet Monday and Burmese
crowded in front of a hospital to search for names of friends and
relatives on a list of the casualties in last week's violence, a
Western tourist reported.
   There were calls for more protest, and Thai officials said
Burmese authorities closed a crossing between Thailand's Ranong
province and the market town of Victoria Point in Burma's
southernmost province of Megui.
   Last week, security forces in Victoria Point were said to have
turned against the authoritarian military government and allowed
thousands of protesters to march unhindered.
   Analysts said they doubted the new Burmese leadership expected
to be chosen Friday will make dramatic changes in the one-party
system Ne Win installed 26 years ago.
   Hard-liner Sein Lwin resigned Friday as Burma's president and
chairman of the Burma Socialist Program Party after five days of
rioting in Rangoon and two dozen other towns and cities across the
Southeast Asian nation. State-run Rangoon radio said the party and
legislature would meet on Friday.
   Ne Win resigned last month and was replaced by Sein Lwin, whose
17 days in office produced a popular uprising against the
quarter-century of repression, economic disaster and isolation.
   Rangoon radio said at least 95 people were killed and 240
wounded last week, but Western diplomats believe the toll was
several times greater. They said it appeared most victims were
unarmed, hit by bullets fired into crowds by soldiers and police.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said
the United States was joining an international effort to donate
medical supplies through the International Committee of the Red
Cross.
   Kate Meehan, a teacher from Australia, said she watched people
read a list of casualties Monday that was posted at the entrance of
Rangoon General Hospital. ``There were heaps of names,'' she said.
   Also in front of the hospital compound was a crude shrine
residents built on the spot where they said security forces shot
doctors and nurses. Various sources have confirmed shooting and
casualties in the area, but no reliable details are available.
   Peter Swan, an Australian moviemaker, had told The Associated
Press he visited the hospital Saturday and saw about 300 people who
were wounded in the rioting.
   Ms. Meehan and other Western tourists who arrived Monday from
Rangoon described the city as quiet, with most barricades removed
but the city hall still off-limits. They said people pushed back
barbed-wire barriers and helped clear streets in the Bogyoke market
district.
   Rangoon remains under martial law, imposed Aug. 3, and an 8
p.m.-4 a.m. curfew decreed six days later.
   The state-run radio also reported calm and said student leaders
in some areas reported to authorities for ``pledge-making
ceremonies,'' at which they promised ``to avoid similar acts in the
future.''
   Leaders of the Christian and Hindu communities met Monday with
the deputy minister of home and religious affairs, Kyi Myunt, and
appealed for peace and the rule of law, the radio said. It reported
a similar meeting Sunday involving Islamic leaders.
   On Sunday, Western diplomats reached by telephone in Rangoon
said students were handing out leaflets calling for pro-democracy
protests now that they had achieved the resignation of Sein Lwin, a
former general hated for brutally suppressing dissent during the Ne
Win's rule.
   Student demands include a multiparty system, restoration of
civil rights, release of political prisoners, student unions and
control of inflation.
   Japan's Kyodo news service said Sunday that protests were being
planned for Monday in several major cities.
   Western diplomats and tourists said many Burmese apparently were
waiting to see what leaders emerge from Friday's meetings before
eciding to risk another round of riots.
   Analysts participating in a panel discussion Monday at
Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok were not optimistic about
meaningful change in Burma.
   ``Ne Win will probably pick a second Sein Lwin who will not be
such a hard liner but still do everything commanded by Ne Win,''
said Zaw Wai, a businessman who speaks for Bangkok's large
community of Burmese emigres.
   Chayachok Chulsiriwongse, a Thai scholar, said Ne Win remains as
``elder statesman'' behind the scenes, and Sein Lwin's successor
probably would come from the serving or retired military officers
who formed his hierarchy.

   Michael Dukakis will weaken America by withdrawing support for
the MX and the Migitman missiles and reduce SDI to a constrained
research and development program. Until recently he has even
opposed the B1 and Stealth bombers.
   Of course the Democrats know that people would reject the real
Michael Dukakis. So, as President Reagan has said, he is traveling
incognito. You have to admit Atlanta was good theater. It was an
off-Broadway revival of ``The Odd Couple,'' starring the diminutive
clerk from Massachusetts and the tall stranger from Texas.
   But when you look at the real Dukakis-Bentsen foreign policies
you have to ask yourself, ``are they running against us or are they
running against each other?''
   And then there's the Reverend Jesse Jackson who likes to say ``a
bird likes to fly on two wings.'' Maybe he forgot some birds with
two wings can't fly at all _ like the extinct dodo bird that was
too stupid to defend itself, or the ostrich which prefers to live
with danger by ignoring it.
   In fact, the more you look at it, the less the Democratic ticket
looks like a bird at all. It's more like a bat _ blind as a bat,
endowed with the sophisticated sensing mechanisms we saw in Atlanta
but totally unable to differentiate. Flying erratically for brief
periods at low levels and hanging upside down for extended periods
in dark, damp caves up to its naval in Guano.
   Lord, America doesn't need any more of that. And so, my friends,
you and I know that next November's election may be the most
important since World War II. Our efforts this week may be decisive
in its outcome.
   We are in New Orleans:
   _ To unify our party
   _ To endorse our worthy candidate, George Bush
   _ To dedicate America to safe and progressive change
   _ To dedicate ourselves, and in behalf of mankind, to a world
guided by rule of law and peace through strength. I thank you.

   Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis, proclaiming that the U.S. space effort has ``lost its
sense of purpose, vision and pride'' under President Reagan, today
proposed the creation of a Cabinet-level post to direct the
nation's space program.
   ``Despite an annual NASA budget of over $10 billion per year,
our space program is in disarray. It suffers from a lack of a
clearly defined purpose and ineffective top management and our
space policy is lost in a maze of bureaucratic committees,''
Dukakis said in a statement issued at a luncheon he attended with
local elected officials and labor and business leaders.
   Dukakis, echoing comments made earlier in the day in Houston by
his running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said he would also
back continued development of a permanent manned space station and
would re-establish a Cabinet-level National Aeronautics and Space
Council, to be chaired by Bentsen.
   Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts, was in Worcester as part
of a two-day visit to the central part of the state. Arriving here,
Dukakis was met by about 100 protestors, about half anti-abortion
and half opponents of his plan to locate a prison in central
Massachusetts.
   He was also hosting an event marking the start of the first
phase of implementation of Massachusetts' universal health care
law, which will guarantee health insurance to virtually all workers
by 1990.
   Dukakis will spend the night at home in Brookline, outside
Boston, and return to several other central Massachusetts
communities Tuesday.
   On Wednesday, he embarks on a four-day campaign trip, with stops
tentatively scheduled in Florida, Minnesota, Illinois, Missouri,
Arkansas and Texas.

   Activists opposed to the government's AIDS
policies lay down on the steps of city hall today in a protest at
the Republican National Convention, where demonstrations have
resulted in five arrests.
   Overall, organizers say fewer protesters than expected have
shown up at the convention.
   Today's demonstration, which attracted about 50 people, was
peaceful, unlike Sunday's incident when five gay activists were
arrested at President Reagan's welcoming party following a shoving
match.
   Before lying down in a symbolic ``die-in,'' protesters at city
hall called for more government support for social and medical
programs for victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or
AIDS.
   On Sunday, the gay activists were booked on charges of
disturbing the peace after a scuffle with bystanders during
Reagan's welcoming speech at the New Orleans Convention Center.
   Other demonstrations came off peacefully, including one Sunday
at which protesters confronted Roman Catholic Archbishop Philip N.
Hannan and criticized church policy on homosexuality.
   Mark Schneider, a spokesman for CARE, an umbrella group for
various activists, said he had expected 12 national groups to join
nine local ones for convention protests.
   But he said turnout from the national groups was lower than
that, although he was not sure how many groups had shown up.
   Groups scheduled to demonstrate today, the official opening of
the convention, included Food Emancipation, Anarchists Against
Republicans and Democrats and Friends of the Homeless Hope House.
   On Sunday, five protesters with the gay rights group Act Up were
arrested after they showed up at Reagan's speech with signs
criticizing his AIDS policy.
   A shoving match ensued and fighting broke out, police spokesman
John Bryson said. He said the protesters started the fight, but gay
activist Morris Kight of Los Angeles denied the charge.
   ``A group of young men physically attacked them,'' Kight said.
``The Secret Service tried to intervene to protect them, but the
police arrested them.''
   Police said today that all five had been released from jail.
   At one end of the French Quarter on Sunday, about 150 women
representing some 20 feminist groups gathered at Armstrong Park.
   ``We are here to tell the world that the Republican Party has
turned its back on women's rights,'' said Molly Yard, president of
the National Organization for Women. `` ... But this does not let
the Democrats off the hook.''
   In the incident at Jackson Square where the archbishop appeared,
the demonstrators staged a homosexual ``kiss in.''
   ``We kiss in an aggressive demonstration of affection,'' said a
statement demonstrators read through a bullhorn. ``We kiss to
protest the cruel and painful bigotry that affects the lives of
lesbians and gay men.''
   Some of the 40 to 50 protesters surged around Archbishop Hannan
after he came out of St. Louis Cathedral between morning Masses.
   ``We're used to demonstrations. Jackson Square is where
everything happens,'' Hannan told a man in a Sunday suit as he
shook hands with parishioners.
   Two protesters went into an extended clinch just behind Hannan.
   ``All I can say is God bless you,'' Hannan said when asked for
comment.
   At the Democratic Convention in Atlanta, a similar ``kiss-in''
led to a shoving match between demonstrators and police. But a
handful of the Big Easy's officers just stood and watched.
   ``That's what we are here _ easygoing,'' said Officer J. Parker.

<HEAD>Temperature Increases: When, Where, How Severe?</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists testifying before Congress agree
the ``greenhouse effect'' assures the Earth is in for rising
temperatures and ocean levels. They don't agree on when, where and
how severe.
   The greenhouse effect is caused by the emission of such gases as
carbon dioxide and methane, trapping heat in the atmosphere.
Scientists say steamy weather and crop losses are two of the
problems people can expect in coming decades.
   Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., chairman of the Senate Energy and
Natural Resources Committee, and Sen. Tim Wirth, D-Colo., have
pledged to make the greenhouse effect a legislative priority in
1989.
   Scientific testimony before the committee last week indicated
the sharply opposing views being presented to Congress.
   Do nothing until there is less scientific uncertainty, said
policymakers from the Reagan administration such as Donna
Fitzpatrick, associate undersecretary of the Department of Energy.
   Get moving now to reduce production of greenhouse gases, said
people such as Stephen Schneider, a climatologist from the National
Center for Atmospheric Research, a Boulder, Colo., operation run by
a consortium of universities.
   Greenhouse-effect gases come from a variety of sources: from the
burning of coal and other fossil fuels, production of such
chemicals as chlorofluorocarbons, the escape of huge amounts of
methane from rice paddies and the release of carbon dioxide from
the destruction of forests.
   Some scientists have cautioned that even if the world reduced
its production of greenhouse gases, those already in the atmosphere
mean that within 30 to 50 years the planet will have its highest
temperatures in 10,000 years.
   Fitzpatrick said more knowledge is needed before Congress
commits the nation to combatting the greenhouse effect through the
type of program proposed in a comprehensive bill introduced by
Johnston, Wirth and 16 colleagues.
   ``Significant gaps exist in our knowledge of the greenhouse
effect _ gaps that must be filled if we are to address the concerns
raised by potential climate change in a scientifically supportable
manner,'' she said.
   ``These scientific uncertainties must be reduced before we
commit the nation's economic future to drastic and potentially
misplaced policy responses,'' she said.
   Schneider, characterizing this position as ``political value
judgments, not scientific opinions,'' said ``we should not use
platitudes about scientific uncertainty as an excuse for inaction.
... There's a (scientific) concern that we are assaulting the
environment much faster than we are understanding it.
   ``More research will certainly put policy-making on a firmer
scientific basis ... but it is my opinion that credible details
about specific `winners and losers' will not be available before we
may have committed ourselves to potentially dangerous, large
atmospheric changes,'' he said.
   Officials from the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, Environmental Protection Agency and National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration told lawmakers of greenhouse
research in their agencies.
   They stopped short of seconding Fitzpatrick's stand that nothing
should be done to combat greenhouse gas production until more
scientific certainty is attained.
   Schneider said ``high-leverage actions are long overdue.'' He
called for steps that would combat greenhouse gases while attacking
other environmental problems such as acid rain, low-level ozone
pollution and destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer by
chlorofluorocarbons.
   He said his first priority would be greater energy efficiency
and conservation to reduce emissions from power plants and
vehicles. No step, he said, should be considered too small because
slowing down the greenhouse effect ``makes good sense.''

   Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd
Bentsen said today that he and running mate Michael Dukakis support
continued development of a permanent manned space station as part
of an ``all-out effort to restore American leadership in exploring
the universe.''
   Bentsen, speaking after a visit to NASA's Houston Spaceflight
Center, said he and Dukakis had discussed the space station in a
Sunday night telephone conversation and that Dukakis had promised
``an intensive review of the space station program in order to
ensure the success of this important effort.''
   ``We will stand behind an all-out effort to restore American
leadership in exploring the universe,'' Bentsen said in the midday
speech, which was made available to reporters beforehand.
   As part of that effort, Dukakis said in Worcester, Mass., that,
if elected, he would create a Cabinet-level position to direct the
nation's space program.
   Dukakis said in a statement that the space program ``suffers
from a lack of a clearly defined purpose and ineffective top
management ... our space policy is lost in a maze of bureaucratic
committees.''
   President Reagan came out for a permanent station in 1984. Under
current plans, the $16 billion station is to be assembled in orbit
beginning in 1995; more than $5 billion in contracts have been
awarded. The House in June approved and sent to the Senate
legislation authorizing spending of $902 million on the station in
the next fiscal year.
   Bentsen, campaigning through Texas while Dukakis is in his home
state of Massachusetts, recalled the early years of the space
effort and said, ``One reason we overcame the initial Soviet lead
in space was good organization and strong leadership.''
   At that time, he said, a Cabinet-level National Aeronautics and
Space Council was established, chaired by the vice president.
   ``Unfortunately, the council was abolished by President Nixon
and (the Reagan) administration vetoed an attempt by Congress to
put in back in business,'' he said, adding:
   ``One of the reasons I accepted Mike Dukakis' offer to be on the
ticket was the understanding he would give the vice president a
major policy role in his administration. We agreed that in a
Dukakis-Bentsen administration the space council would be
reinstated and I would serve as chairman.''
   The timing of the announcement in Houston gave Bentsen an
opportunity to promise more jobs and more federal spending for his
home state, which will be a major battleground in the fall campaign.
   ``My friends, that nails it down,'' Bentsen said. ``There should
be no doubt in Houston or anywhere else in the world where a
Dukakis-Bentsen administration will stand in space.''
   From Houston, Bentsen was scooting across the state line into
Arkansas for a rally in Little Rock and then returning to Beaumont,
Texas, for a rally.
   He spent Sunday resting with a visit to his father's home near
McAllen, Texas. Reporters were kept away, but Bentsen spokesman
Mike McCurry said the major event was a gin rummy game won, as
usual, by the 94-year-old Lloyd Bentsen Sr.
   Besides recharging the 67-year-old senator's batteries, the stop
underlined the campaign's effort to point out that Bentsen is a
native Texan. Vice President George Bush, who receives the
Republican nomination this week, claims Texas as his home but was
raised in New England.
   Dukakis plans to join Bentsen in the state later in the week,
and Bentsen points out that before he was on the ticket the
Republicans were cocky.
   ``They thought they had this state locked up,'' he told
reporters.
   Bentsen speaks confidently of winning Texas and Houston, the
city both he and Bush have called home.
   ``I think we'll carry Houston, sure do,'' he said.
   Bentsen beat Bush in Texas once before, in the 1970 election
that first put him in the Senate. He chuckled when reporters asked
if he was concerned now that Bush was moving part of his national
campaign organization to the state.
   ``No, it doesn't worry me,'' he said. ``He's had his operations
here before.''
   Bentsen is running parallel campaigns for the vice presidency
and for re-election to his Senate seat. The dual candidacies are
allowed under an unusual Texas law.

<HEAD>Hirohito Marks Anniversary of End of World War II</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emperor Hirohito told a ceremony marking the
anniversary Monday of the end of World War II that his heart still
hurts when he thinks of the victims of the war.
   In a national radio broadcast 43 years earlier, he urged the
Japanese people to accept unconditional surrender to the Allies,
following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It was the
first time that most Japanese ever heard his voice.
   Now 87 and the world's longest reigning monarch, Hirohito
shuffled slowly Monday to the microphone in front of an altar
decorated with thousands of white and yellow crysanthemums, but
spoke in a firm voice.
   ``Today, on the day to honor the war dead and pray for peace, I
think of those who died in battle in the last war and their
bereaved families, and it still hurts my heart,'' he said.
   ``Time flies fast, and in the 43 years since the end of the war,
the country has developed due to people's efforts. However, looking
back on those days, I have quite profound feelings,'' he said.
   The emperor, the only major wartime leader still alive,
underwent surgery last year so doctors could perform a bypass a
growth in his pancreas. Since then, he has made few public
appearances.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, who also attended the
government-sponsored ceremony at a large martial arts hall near the
Imperial Palace, said Japan should learn from the ``noble
sacrifice'' of those who died in the war, and pledged the country
would do all it can to achieve world peace.
   About 7,000 people attended the ceremony, including relatives of
war victims and Cabinet members.
   In cities around Japan, a variety of religious and citizens'
groups held rallies against war and against visits by Cabinet
members to Yasukuni Shrine, a Shinto shrine in Tokyo dedicated to
Japan's war dead.
   Among the 2.4 million war dead at the shrine, financed by the
government until the end of World War II, are 14 major war
criminals, including wartime Prime Minister Hideki Tojo.
   Takeshita, who plans to visit China later this month, decided
not to go to the shrine this year, although 11 of the 21 members of
his Cabinet did, including Deputy Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa,
Kyodo News Service reported.
   Several hundred other members of the governing Liberal
Democratic Party also visited the shrine Monday, as did thousands
of other Japanese, it said.
   Takeshita's predecessor, Yasuhiro Nakasone, stopped visiting
Yasukuni after China, South Korea and other Asian countries that
suffered under Japanese militarism criticized his official visit to
it in 1985.
   The shrine was established in 1869 and was used by the military
to promote patriotism and militarism during World War II.

   The Metropolitan Life Foundation announced
Monday it is distributing $300,000 in grants to foster partnerships
between five colleges and public schools and thereby enhance
teacher programs.
   The foundation was established in 1976 by the Metropolitan Life
Insurance Co. to distribute grants to education, health and civic
groups. Over the past three years, the foundation has distributed
more than $772,000 to foster partnerships between colleges and
public schools.
   ``We're convinced that programs to bring college and university
faculty into partnerships with teachers from local public schools
enhances collegiality and encourages creativity in solving
important educational problems,'' said Sibyl Jacobson, the
foundation's president.
   The new awards included:
   _ $71,000 to Florida Memorial College and Miami Northwestern
Senior High School to establish a new partnership between the
college's faculty and the public school's parents and teachers to
develop new teaching techniques to help curb the dropout rate.
   _ $71,000 to Fordham University Graduate School of Education and
District 10 Prep School in New York to help graduate student social
workers and classroom teachers to identify potential junior high
school dropouts.
   _ $69,000 to Lawrence Hall of Science-University of California
at Berkeley and Richmond Unified School District for a program to
recruit senior citizen volunteers to teach 720 students in small
groups.
   _ $39,000 to Montclair State College and the Newark, N.J.,
public school system to include college faculty, public school
teachers, parents and elementary school children in home and school
activities aimed at fostering reading and academic skills.
   _ $50,000 to SUNY College at Brockport, N.Y., and School No.
6-Rochester City School District, N.Y., to support the Genessee
River Valley project, a curriculum designed by teachers at the
public school which uses the nearby river as the starting point for
interdisciplinary study.

   Several people attending a concert by Linda
Ronstadt walked out demanding refunds because she sang only in
Spanish and ignored cries from the audience to sing in English.
   The singer is on tour promoting her latest album that features
Mexican folk songs. Advertisements for the two-hour concert at
Great Woods in Mansfield Friday night promoted the concert as
``Linda Ronstadt: Canciones de Mi Padre'' or ``Songs of My Father.''
   ``What amazed us was that we weren't informed at all that the
whole show was going to be in Spanish,'' said Cheryl Manson of
Danvers. She said she got a refund for her $50 seat.
   ``Coinsidering that we were dressed for country, it was like we
had shown up at our own wedding dressed in jeans,'' she said.
   It wasn't known how many people actually left the concert, or
how many refunds were given, the Boston Herald said Sunday.

<DATELINE>TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The founding chapter of the nation's
largest college fraternity is fighting for its life because of the
arrests of four members on cocaine charges.
   University of Alabama officials have ordered the fraternity _
Sigma Alpha Epsilon _ shut down for two years because of the drug
arrests.
   Fraternity leaders are hoping for a favorable ruling in an
appeal which is expected to be decided this month. Otherwise, the
fraternity's stately, white-columned ``mother chapter'' will be
closed until 1991.
   Despite the suspension, the fraternity will recruit members
during rush week, which begins Tuesday, on this campus where it was
formed in 1856. It has 210,000 members nationally and many
prominent alumni in this state.
   ``With this going on, who knows how many pledges we will have?''
said Bill Smithart, a Tuscaloosa attorney and SAE member who heads
an alumni board set up to direct the chapter about 1{ years ago.
   Also on Tuesday, authorities have scheduled an arraignment for
three of the four arrested: Chandler Eskridge, 21, of Prattville;
William Dodd Roberds Jr., 21, of Memphis, Tenn.; and John Barnette
Jr., a junior from Atlanta.
   The three were indicted on charges of selling cocaine, said
District Attorney Charles Freeman. The case against a fourth
student was closed after a grand jury refused to return an
indictment.
   Two of the four were removed from the fraternity and two were
suspended pending the outcome of the case, which includes
allegations that at one point drugs were sold inside the fraternity
house.
   Ken Tracey, national executive director of SAE, said each of the
organization's 200 chapters is watching what happens to the
60-member Alabama house. SAE has initiated more people than any of
the 60 other national fraternities, and it ranks eighth in terms of
the number of chapters.
   ``We are not holding our chapter accountable. These were
individual arrests in individual cases,'' Tracey said in a recent
telephone interview from SAE headquarters in Evanston, Ill.
   Jonathan Brant, head of the National Interfraternity Conference,
said the entire world of Greek-letter organizations also would be
interested in the outcome at a time when universities are
struggling to define their role in regulating student organizations.
   Brant said the conference is ``trying to get universities more
involved'' in the governing of Greek organizations because of an
apparent increase in the number of problems with alcohol abuse,
drugs, hazing and racism.
   ``But many of these things are going on across campus, not just
in fraternities and sororities,'' which have experienced a
resurgence in popularity this decade, said Brant. Total
undergraduate membership in fraternities nearly doubled from
230,000 in 1980 to 400,000 in 1985 after reaching a low of 157,000
in 1970.
   Officials at the University of Alabama made it clear that SAE,
despite former prominence, has what they consider to be a checkered
past.
   Edward Whipple, director of student life, announced the
suspension in June saying the move was based partly on what he
called a ``history of repeated infractions.''
   ``I hope that during this two-year suspension period all SAE
alumni will work together toward the day when we will have a
drug-free, hazing-free chapter of SAE at the University of
Alabama,'' Whipple said at the time.
   Associate Law Dean Tom Jones will hear the appeal of the
suspension soon, university spokeswoman Dale Allison said last
week, and university President Joab Thomas wants to make a final
decision on the appeal before he vacates the presidency Sept. 1 to
return to teaching.
   Whipple's statement mentioned a 1979 probation for hazing of
pledges and a 1980 probation violation, a 1982 case in which the
fraternity was convicted on six counts of violating the student
conduct code and 1987 investigations by the university and SAE
national that found a drug problem and extensive hazing in the
chapter.
   Smithart and Tracey do not deny past problems, but both maintain
the group was caught in the trap of a vengeful college
administration.
   ``We've got a whole new group of boys, and they are being blamed
... for things that happened while they were still in elementary
school,'' said Tracey.
   Smithart said the fraternity has been doing better in many
areas, including academics. Its grade-point average has moved from
the middle of Alabama's 28-fraternity pack to second, partly as a
result of hiring a full-time academic counselor, he said.
   The chapter has proposed a drug-testing program for members,
Smithart said, although he said he never believed there was
widespread drug use in the chapter.

<HEAD>Convention Portraying Bush as War Hero, Family Man, Leader</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   War hero. Family man. National leader.
   If those phrases don't bring to mind George Bush, wait until
Republican convention officials wind up four days of prime-time
image building.
   ``I'm confident that when all is said and done with this
convention, the American people are going to feel very good about
George Bush,'' says convention producer Mark Goode.
   Goode derides last month's Democratic convention as ``long on
platitudes and short on substance'' and maintains his own
production is not ``some sort of Madison Avenue job.''
   Nevertheless, planners are leaving little to chance in their
efforts to highlight what they say is the true nature of their
standard-bearer.
   ``What people will see in their living rooms will be an
individual who has very selflessly given of himself over many, many
years in a variety of public service positions,'' said Goode. ``A
very committed husband and father; an experienced public servant; a
decorated war hero; and a loyal vice president who worked very hard
behind the scenes to help create a lot of the Reagan legacy.''
   Goode said there will be ``an entire host of speeches'' about
Bush's life and career, including one Wednesday night in Spanish by
his Mexican daughter-in-law.
   The speeches were honed to consistency with the convention
themes. An early podium sample from Max Fisher, a Detroit real
estate magnate and chairman of the National Jewish Republican
Coalition: ``He's not only a war hero, he's a peace hero.''
   Roger Ailes, Bush's masterful media adviser, produced a film
about the vice president scheduled for Thursday night. Expect to
see lots of frolicking with the grandchildren, underscoring the
family man theme.
   But don't expect a camera tour of the 11-acre family vacation
compound on the coast of southern Maine. Advisers reportedly were
concerned about showing evidence of Bush's wealth.
   Something else viewers won't see: Bush with Ronald Reagan, the
near-mythical man from whose shadow he must emerge. Reagan's
farewell, with all of its attendant drama and emotion, will be long
over as the spotlight shifts to Bush and his family.
   The first Bush to mount the podium will be George Prescott Bush,
the prospective nominee's 12-year-old grandson. He'll lead the
Pledge of Allegiance on Tuesday.
   Young George's parents _ Jeb and Columba Garnica Bush, a native
of Leon Guanajuato, Mexico _ will be speaking Wednesday. And later
that night, during the roll call, son George Jr. will announce from
his spot among fellow Texas delegates the 111 votes clinching the
nomination for his father.
   ``To have his son of the same name put him over the top speaks
about family and the commitment of our family to work hard for the
person we love,'' George Jr. said in an interview. Bush's five
children are all convention delegates.
   The Bush presence, a healthy 60 counting cousins, siblings and
other relatives, culminates Thursday night with a speech by Barbara
Bush, the candidate's wife of 43 years, the Ailes film about Bush,
and Bush's acceptance speech.
   What will he say? ``What we are trying to do (in the speech) is
have George Bush define where he wants to take the country in the
next four years,'' Goode said. He called Bush's plans ``very
specific.''
   The best-laid plans of convention organizers are still subject
to the whims of the network television executives who determine
whether anyone outside of cable viewers actually will see their
careful orchestrations.
   The Bush film, slightly over 7 minutes long, is a key thematic
element. An NBC spokeswoman said the network plans to show it all.
The other two networks hadn't yet decided.
   But even if the networks wreak havoc with the GOP's master plan,
that sturdy triad of family man, hero and leader, ``we won't be
thwarted,'' Goode said. ``The campaign begins in earnest after the
convention, anyway. And those are obviously things that we'll be
stressing beyond the convention.''

   Holly Robinson, star of Fox Television's ``21
Jump Street,'' is not coy in explaining how she got her break in
show business.
   ``Pure nepotism,'' she says in the Aug. 20 issue of TV Guide.
   Miss Robinson was referring to assistance from her mother,
Dolores, one of Hollywood's top personal managers, and her father,
Matt, who played Gordon on ``Sesame Street'' and is a head writer
for ``The Cosby Show.''
   The 23-year-old actress, who studied at the Sorbonne in Paris
and speaks four languages, has had only one previous role, as LeVar
Burton's sister in the movie ``Dummy.''
   She would like a singing career, but her only stints so far have
been singing ``The Star Spangled Banner'' at Los Angeles Dodgers
baseball games and Seattle Seahawks football games.
   ``They wanted Whitney Houston, but they couldn't afford her, so
I decided to take her leftovers,'' she said.

   Jackie Collins, the queen of romance fiction,
says her yen for steamy stories began at an early age when she
routinely ditched her schoolbooks for Harold Robbins and Mickey
Spillane novels.
   ``When I was about 8, I would copy dirty limericks into my diary
and charge all the girls in school a few pence to read them,'' says
the London-born author of ``Hollywood Wives'' and ``Rock Star.''
   Her ``bad girl'' reputation was well earned, the sister of
actress Joan Collins said in the September issue of Glamour
magazine. ``I'd play truant for literally months at a time,
sneaking off to coffee bars in Soho, and, of course, to the movies.
   ``At 15 I was expelled _ for truancy, for smoking and for waving
at the neighborhood flasher,'' she said.

   When Charles R. Vaughan found out he
would be portrayed by Oscar-winning actor George C. Scott in a
television movie, his own stock shot up dramatically.
   ``I can't walk down the street, I can't eat at a restaurant,''
said Vaughn, a Lafayette attorney. ``The response is constant. It's
always, `Hey, George!'''
   The film on AIDS victim Ryan White will air on ABC later this
year. Vaughn represented the teen-ager in his successful battle to
attend a Kokomo-area school. White soon left Kokomo because of
lingering bitterness and moved to Cicero.
   Vaughn said he is gratified by the interest Scott has shown in
the case. ``The producers said he knew all about the Ryan White
story. He said this was a part he wanted,'' Vaughn said.

   Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip
met with some 40 survivors and relatives of the worst oil rig
disaster in history, but their visit Monday was marred by the
injuries of two seamen trying to guide the royal yacht into harbor.
   A deck hand was admitted to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for chest
and abdominal bruising and a harbor pilot was treated and released,
police said. The two had gotten caught between the yacht and their
pilot vessel as the boats pitched in rough seas.
   The queen was asleep at the time and the yacht Britannia docked
safely. Later Elizabeth and her husband talked with those involved
in the July 6 tragedy in which 167 men lost their lives.
   The couple then headed for Balmoral Castle, the royal summer
retreat in the Scottish Highlands, where they will see their fifth
grandchild for the first time.
   The Princess of York, the first child of the queen's second son
Prince Andrew and his wife Sarah, was born Aug. 8 in London. The
baby's name is expected to be made public after receiving approval
from the queen.

   Former police detective Eddie Egan,
who helped crack the French Connection heroin ring that was the
basis for an Academy-Award winning movie, said a sequel he's
planning will be even more intriguing.
   A movie company he's formed, he said, will tell how the 112
pounds of heroin seized in the 1962 bust was stolen from New York
police vaults.
   Egan's role in cracking the heroin trafficking scheme was
portrayed by Gene Hackman in ``The French Connection.''
   Egan retired from the police force in 1971 and became a
character actor in such TV and movie stories as ``Badge 373,''
``Police Story,'' and ``Joe Forrester.''
   Filming on the $8 million movie will start in Fort Lauderdale in
the fall, Egan told the Fort Lauderdale News and Sun-Sentinel.

<HEAD>Lefebvre Followers, Church Loyalists March in Dueling Processions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roman Catholics loyal to the Vatican and followers
of rebel archbishop Marcel Lefebvre organized competing processions
Monday, each attracting about 5,000 faithful to renew France's
350-year-old vow of consecration to the Virgin Mary.
   Carrying statues and banners of the Virgin, and chanting ``Hail
Marys'' _ the loyalist group in French, the traditionalists in
Latin _ the two sets of marchers added color to downtown streets on
the Assumption Day holiday, one of the quietest days of the year in
France.
   Parisians and tourists at sidewalk cafes turned to watch the
processions and puffs of incense.
   This was the third year of dueling processions on Aug. 15, but
the competition was sharpened this year by the recent schism and
excommunication of Lefebvre for consecrating bishops without
permission from Pope John Paul II.
   It also drew added attention because Monday was the 350th
anniversary of King Louis XIII's vow of France's loyalty to the
Virgin. It is celebrated on Assumption Day, which marks the day
Mary was received into heaven.
   Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger, the archbishop of Paris, led the
official ceremony at Notre Dame Cathedral.
   Across the Seine River in the Latin Quarter, the traditionalist
procession was led by Monsignor Bernard Tissier de Mallerais, one
of the four bishops Lefebvre consecrated in a ceremony June 30 at
Econe, Switzerland.
   Lefrebvre was excommunicated for going through with the
consecrations without papal permission, creating the church's first
schism in more than a century.
   ``Those who remain faithful to Monsignor Lefebvre will stay in
the path of grace,'' Tissier de Mallerais said before the
procession left the church of St. Nicolas du Chardonnet. ``Those
who do nor remain faithful will lose this grace.''
   The 17th century church, in the ancient Latin Quarter a few
short blocks from Notre Dame, has been occupied since 1977 by
traditionalist worshipers and priests who follow Lefebvre in
rejecting such church reforms as Mass said in modern languages
instead of Latin.
   Lustiger has taken steps recently to try to appeal to the
traditionalists, including establishing the Assumption Day
procession three years ago, following their example. He also said
Mass in Latin at Notre Dame, and said the traditional Latin Mass
would be used in three Paris churches each Sunday.
   ``It's an effort to co-opt people,'' said Jean-Baptiste
Chaumeil, one of the marchers in the traditionalist procession.
``It shows a hypocrisy. The French bishops have always been against
Monsignor Lefebvre and tried to make sure the negotiations with
Rome would fail.''
   At the halfway point of their procession, at the ruins of the
Roman arena of Lutece, there was a caged lion, which organizers
said was intended to evoke the martyrdom of early Christians and
symbolize the plight of Lefebvre's followers.
   Police estimated the traditionalist procession at about 5,000
people.
   Roughly the same number were gathered at the same time in
late-afternoon sunshine in the square in front of Notre Dame
Cathedral.
   Huge banners decorated the famous facade, including one
multicolored representation of the Virgin holding the Christ child
that was hung between the Western towers.
   Church officials said it reproduced a tapestry said to have hung
in Notre Dame in 1638, when King Louis XIII dedicated the nation to
Mary.
   Another banner reproduced the king's words: ``We believed
ourselves obliged to consecrate our person and our state to the
grandeur of God.''
   The processions also were linked to ceremonies worldwide marking
the end of the Roman Catholic Church's Marian Year, a period
designated by the pope for special devotion to the mother of Jesus.

<TEXT>
   Despite her
fear of flying, Pearl Bailey is riding helicopters and small
aircraft this week in a visit to the U.S. Navy in the gulf.
   It's not a new experience for the 70-year-old singer, who
recalls doing her first show for servicemen in 1941, and has been
among the professional entertainers on the United Service
Organizations _ better known as the USO _ circuit ever since.
   ``The reason I do it is simple,'' she said. ``I tell 'em that
nobody promised them the bright lights of Broadway out here, but
one thing we did promise them is that we wouldn't forget them _ and
that's why I'm here.''
   Miss Bailey and a five-member band headed by her husband, jazz
drummer Louie Bellson, performed Sunday and Monday for audiences
aboard the Coronado, the flagship of the Navy's 27-ship regional
task force.
   Earlier, they performed aboard the aircraft carrier Carl M.
Vinson and the submarine tender Emory S. Land in the Arabian Sea.
   Miss Bailey, who starred in a Broadway production of ``Hello,
Dolly'' in the 1960s, conceded that most of the sailors, whose
average age is about 23, have only a vague idea of who she is.
   But she won a standing ovation for her show, which featured
``Chicago'' and ``The Battle Hymn of the Republic,'' a song that
she said ``a voice told me to sing in every show I ever do.''
   Afterward, despite the debilitating heat and an inflamed knee,
she signed autographs for more than an hour.
   ``Most of them didn't know who she was, but now they do,'' said
Marcus Hutchins, a sailor from East Orange, N.J. ``It was a great
show. It's wonderful that she'd come out to the gulf and share her
love for us.''
   Men from the missile cruiser Halsey, moored alongside the
Coronado, the missile frigate Vandegrift and several U.S. mine
sweepers also were present.
   For Monday's second performance, her last before returning home,
the Navy invited officers and crew from two British ships, the
frigate Southampton and the mine sweeper Middleton.
   In addition to performing, Miss Bailey is a member of the U.S.
delegation to the U.N. General Assembly. Her USO tour, originally
scheduled for June, was postponed after a U.S. warship hit a mine.
   Miss Bailey said the USO, funded by contributions from
foundations, corporations and other private sources, involves many
visits to military hospitals as well as performing.
   Although the pace is grueling, she said more professional
entertainers should visit what she called ``the far corners, the
woods and places.''
   She said she fears flying so much that at home, she either
drives cross-country or takes Amtrak trains.
   ``A lot of people are gonna ask, `How did the Amtrak girl get
out there?' Well, I'm good, but I don't walk on water.''

<HEAD>Industry Output Up; So Are Inflation Worries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. industrial production shot up 0.8 percent
in July, the biggest increase in nine months, the government said
Monday in a report which intensified economists' worries about
rising inflationary pressures.
   The Federal Reserve said the large July advance was widespread
throughout U.S. manufacturing industries and also reflected heavy
demand for electricity during the summer heat wave.
   The 0.8 percent July advance was double the 0.4 percent June
increase and marked the 10th consecutive month that industrial
production has risen. It was the largest increase since a 1.1
percent rise last October.
   ``The economy has a tremendous head of steam,'' said Allen
Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co. ``It increasingly looks
like an old-fashioned boom in the industrial sector with strong
demand and production pressures bringing on inflation.''
   Many economists had been expecting a strong July increase, given
the fact the Labor Department already had reported that
manufacturing employment rose by 68,000 jobs in July, the largest
increase this year.
   ``We are seeing an industrial sector that is surging under the
impact of increased exports and higher capital spending,'' said
Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist of the National Association of
Manufacturers.
   But Jasinowski said some of the strength in July was overstated,
reflecting the increased electrical demand and some unwanted
buildup in inventories.
   ``People ought not be frightened by these hefty industrial
production numbers because the inventory buildup we have been
seeing shows that there is still slack in the economy,'' he said.
   Other analysts said the Federal Reserve would likely read the
new figures as further evidence of an overheated economy that needs
to be cooled down by additional increases in interest rates.
   Last week, the central bank boosted its discount rate one-half
percentage point to 6.5 percent. Raising the discount rate, the fee
the Federal Reserve charges for lending to commercial banks, is the
most dramatic signal the Fed can send of its intent to fight
inflation by dampening demand through higher interest rates.
   Many economists said they expect further Fed tightening in
upcoming weeks, especially in light of the strong industrial
production figures.
   ``The Fed is facing increasing evidence of more strength than
desired in the economy,'' said David Jones, an economist with
Aubrey G. Lanston & Co., a government securities dealer. ``This
growth is too rapid at a time when we are nearly fully employed in
the labor force and are running up against capacity restraints in
many industries.''
   The manufacturing sector has been the star of the economy this
year as American producers have enjoyed strong foreign sales
brought on by a weaker dollar.
   The export boom has prompted a related surge in business
investment to expand production facilities to meet the rising
demand. Reflecting this increase, the industrial production report
showed that output of business equipment increased 1 percent in
July, continuing a trend that has pushed output in this sector up
9.7 percent above where it was a year ago, the fastest increase of
any sector.
   The overall July increase came despite the fact that auto output
actually fell. Autos were assembled at an annual rate of 7.1
million units, down from a pace of 7.5 million units in June.
Production of light trucks also decreased during the month.
   Production of consumer goods was up 0.3 percent in July with
gains in both appliance production and non-durable goods sectors.
   Output of construction supplies fell for the second consecutive
month, dropping 0.3 percent following a 0.1 percent decline in
June. The report blamed a strike in the lumber industry for the
weakness.
   Overall, output by U.S. manufacturers climbed 0.8 percent and
now stands 5.6 percent higher than a year ago. In July, production
of durable goods, items expected to last at least three years, and
non-durable goods both rose 0.8 percent.
   Utility production climbed 0.6 percent following a huge 2.5
percent June increase with both months showing heavy demand for air
conditioning.
   Output at the nation's mines, including oil- and gas-drilling
activities, rose 0.6 percent in July. This sector is now producing
at a rate 4.9 percent higher than a year ago.
   Total output stood at 137.7 percent of its 1977 base of 100.

<HEAD>One Of Few Black Female Federal Judges Returns To Private Practice</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge stepped down from the bench
Monday to return to private legal practice, leaving fewer than a
dozen black women among the nation's federal trial judges.
   U.S. District Judge Gabrielle McDonald said she considered that
statistic when deciding to leave the bench after nine years.
   ``One of the most pressing concerns I have is my race and my
sex, because I know I have brought to the bench a different
perspective,'' she said. ``The federal judiciary is an institution,
and an institution should reflect society.''
   However, she said: ``I think I've done all I can do here. For
me, it's time to move on.''
   A desire to return to private practice, rather than
philosophical considerations, prompted her to leave the bench.
   ``I'm not so much leaving, but resuming what I did the years
before I came here,'' Mrs. McDonald said. ``I want to practice
quality law.''
   But she also cited overloaded dockets and lack of support
services as reasons for returning to private practice. She said
budget cutbacks had left each federal judge in Houston struggling
to handle more than 1,000 cases without enough employeees or
adequate computer systems to handle the work.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, now the Democrats' vice presidential
nominee, recommended Mrs. McDonald for a federal judgeship when she
was a lawyer handling employment discrimination cases.
   ``I feel very, very loyal to Senator Bentsen,'' she said. ``For
him to appoint me when I had a reputation for suing on behalf of
minorities _ that took courage.''
   Mrs. McDonald was sworn in May 31, 1979, whens she was 37, and
became the first black and the third woman to assume a federal
judgeship in Texas.
   Her race came into play in several of her cases.
   The grand dragon of the Ku Klux Klan in 1981 asked her to step
aside in a lawsuit brought by Vietnamese shrimpers who claimed they
were being harassed by Klan members.
   Mrs. McDonald refused the request, pointing out that the grand
dragon had never heard her express a personal opinion about the
Klan.
   Her race became an issue again when she presided over a dispute
about attorneys' fees in a package of voting rights lawsuits
brought against the city of Houston. The suits eventually led to
changes in the way the City Council is elected.
   The city asked her to step down from the case in 1984, saying
that as a black she was a plaintiff in the class-action suits filed
on behalf of Hispanic and black voters.
   Mrs. McDonald refused to bow out and her decision was upheld by
the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   ``If the 5th Circuit had not affirmed, I expect I would have
left the bench then; that's how important it was,'' she said. ``A
decision not to affirm would have rendered me a second-class
citizen.''

<HEAD>Wyoming Locked In Battle With Justice Department Over Absentee
Ballots</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wyoming officials today refused to
acknowledge the state violated federal election laws in its
handling of absentee ballots, setting up a showdown in court
against the U.S. government.
   At issue is when the state's county clerks mailed out absentee
ballots for Tuesday's primary elections.
   Some counties sent the ballots just 26 days before the election;
the U.S. Justice Department prefers that ballots be sent at least
30 days in advance.
   Wyoming officials today said they refused to sign a Justice
Department stipulation saying they violated the law and agreeing to
count any ballots received through Aug. 22, six days after the U.S.
Senate and House primaries.
   ``We are not going to enter into a consent order,'' said Wyoming
Secretary of State Kathy Karpan.
   She said she expected the Justice Department to go into federal
court later today to obtain a court order imposing the six-day
extension.
   State officials believe fewer than 1,000 absentee ballots are at
stake.
   Karpan and state Attorney General Joseph Meyer said they do not
believe the state violated any election laws.
   ``There is no set date in the statute that says (absentee
ballots must be mailed) so many days (before a primary),'' said Ms.
Karpan. ``There are no rules and regs ... so we're not so sure that
we're not in compliance.''

   United in marriage but divided by politics,
Illinois GOP delegates Carl and Karen Hawkinson say George Bush's
choice of a running mate could end their friendly disagreement.
   Hawkinson, 40, a state senator from Galesburg, was elected as a
delegate for Kansas Sen. Bob Dole. Mrs. Hawkinson, 35, the county
GOP chairwoman, got her ticket to New Orleans as a Bush delegate.
   Now, both agree Dole would make a top-flight running mate.
   ``I think we're close,'' Hawkinson said Monday.
   Their most memorable piece of political pillow talk was a
late-night phone call from Lee Daniels, Dole's Illinois campaign
chairman, a few days before the March 15 primary.
   ``We were talking about strategy for Dole coming to Galesburg,''
Hawkinson said. ``And after all of this, he said, `Don't tell
Karen.'
   ``And I said, `Well, Lee, she's been lying here listening to the
whole thing, but I'm sure she won't report it.''
   ``And I didn't,'' Mrs. Hawkinson added.

<HEAD>Ad Agency Loses State's Anti-Smoking Account Over Tobacco Ties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State health officials have canceled a $1.7
million contract with an ad agency to produce youth-oriented,
no-smoking commercials because the agency merged with another which
has a tobacco company account.
   The incident ``shows how long the tentacles of the tobacco
industry are,'' said Kathy Harty, manager of the state Health
Department's section on nonsmoking and health.
   The Campbell-Mithun agency, based in Minneapolis, recently
merged with New York-based William Esty, which has a $35 million
account with Brown & Williamson Tobacco Co.
   Campbell-Mithun, which had a two-year contract with the state,
developed and produced television and radio spots that have been
broadcast regularly around the state since January. One shows
students falling over, domino-fashion, from the bad breath of a
teen-age girl smoker. Another highlights the smelly odor left in
smokers' clothes.
   The campaign, rather than focusing on long-term health risks of
smoking, emphasized the lowered personal attractiveness and social
isolation of the smoker.
   The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recently began
airing animated public service ads with a similar tone,
characterizing smokers as ``buttheads'' and pariahs.
   Harty said Friday that Campbell-Mithun would be replaced by the
Martin-Williams agency of Minneapolis for at least two years.
   The contract with Campbell-Mithun had just been renewed when its
merger with Esty was announced last month, she added.
   The Campbell-Mithun advertisements have been ``very effective,''
Harty said, based on measurements of audience reach and recall.
   Campbell-Mithun made deft use of the state's limited
media-buying budget, obtaining a significant number of free spots
along with those it bought, she said.
   Paula Baldwin, a spokeswoman for what now is Campbell-Mithun
Esty, said the move ``was an extremely difficult decision to reach,
but it was an amicable one. We remain very, very proud of the work
we did.''
   Esty and the former Campbell-Mithun agencies are owned by the
New York-based Saatchi & Saatchi DFS Inc.
   Mary Gustafson, a Martin-Williams spokeswoman, said the agency's
projections indicate very little likelihood of landing a
tobacco-linked account.
   ``Even if it should happen, we've made a commitment to (the
Health Department's) section on nonsmoking,'' she said. ``We'd ask
(the prospective client) to understand, but it they didn't we'd
probably not pitch for their business.''

<HEAD>Reagan a Hard Act to Follow, Really Loves His Job</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No one can say that we'll never see the likes
of him again, but Ronald Reagan will be a hard act for any
president to follow.
   The man actually enjoys the job.
   Other presidents pursued the office with equal ardor, but none
has savored it the way Reagan does.
   Harry Truman used to refer to the White House as ``that great
white prison,'' yet he had the luxury in those safer times of
taking a walk around the block. By contrast, Reagan is swaddled in
a germ-free cocoon and hasn't seemed to mind. If he were to write a
book, you can bet it won't be about the splendid misery of it all.
   That aura of comfort in the job invited a comment from delegate
James Proctor from Rocky Mount, N.C., that you hear often around
the Republican National Convention: ``I don't think there's anybody
here who wouldn't like to have Ronald Reagan on the ticket again.''
   George Bush _ and, for that matter, Michael Dukakis _ eat your
heart out.
   Everything about Reagan shows his pleasure with the best role of
his actor's life. It's in his body language. He bounds onstage for
speeches; he looks interested in the other guy's speech; he laughs
at every punch line. His wave to crowds is never forced. Amiability
is his strong suit.
   He has turned his age to advantage with endless variations of
the same one-liner. ``I always feel at home here in Louisiana
because, you know, I'm the fellow that talked Tom Jefferson into
buying it,'' he said at a rally welcoming him to New Orleans on
Sunday. It got a laugh; it always does.
   Where other presidents were renowned for their inability to make
small talk _ Richard Nixon comes to mind _ Reagan is the kind of
man you'd like at your dinner party. He is a natural quipster and
never more so than on the day he was shot.
   As he was wheeled into the operating room, he told Nancy,
``Honey, I forgot to duck.'' To his doctors: ``Please tell me
you're all Republicans.'' and, en route to the recovery room, ``All
in all, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.''
   Politics aside, Americans like a man like that. He is the movie
cowboy blowing the smoke away from his gun barrel, John Wayne
striding across the shot-up deck of his destroyer, Will Rogers
finding humor in the serious business of politics.
   George Bush was a real war hero, but he's derided as the wimp.
Reagan's the tough guy who spent his war years making movies for
the Army.
   Franklin D. Roosevelt developed a rapport with the American
people by extolling optimism in a dark time. Reagan has taken pages
out of FDR's book, ridiculing the malaise that Jimmy Carter talked
about. ``A New Beginning,'' was his campaign slogan in 1980. ``It's
Morning in America,'' was the refrain in 1984.
   Who else could get away with the things Reagan does? He and his
wife speak freely of family values when their own family is torn.
His reputation is that of a religious man, yet he seldom goes to
church. He is caught red-handed with faulty facts, misstatements,
admission of ignorance of his administration's doings and he walks
away with head held high.
   It is, as Rep. Pat Schroeder said, a Teflon presidency where
nothing sticks.
   Far from being a drawback, Reagan's actor background has helped
him mold public opinion. No matter what he says, it sounds good
when he says it. Television is his medium. He handles it better
than anyone since John F. Kennedy.
   Used to taking orders from directors in his earlier career,
Reagan has surrounded himself with aides to whom he delegates much
authority. That enables him to be what he said he would be, a
9-to-5 executive who does not take work home.
   He came in to the White House with solidly rooted ideas and it
has been both an attribute and a flaw that he sticks with them no
matter what. His off-the-cuff public statements often draw on the
3-by-5 cards he used during his political infancy in the 1960s and
even before when he honed his conservative views as a company
spokesman for General Electric.
   Reagan is the 40th American president, the first actor, the
first divorced man, and the oldest ever. His administration was
tainted by scandal, by the Iran-Contra affair, by budget deficits,
by curtailment of programs.
   None of that necessarily will be stressed by history. What will
be remembered is Ronald Reagan.

<HEAD>Second Fire In Three Days at Landmark</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fire broke out Monday on the 51st floor of the
Empire State Building, forcing dozens of office workers to evacuate
the 102-story tower, and officials said the second blaze there in
three days was suspicious.
   The blaze, which began in a batch of carpets discarded in a
stairwell, produced heavy smoke but caused only minor damage to the
landmark skyscraper. Firefighters doused the fire about a half hour
after it began.
   Authorities declined to say why the fire was declared
suspicious, but Fire Commissioner Joseph Bruno said the
investigation would include why 10 rolled-up carpets were stashed
in the stairwell.
   Chief Robert Manson, the deputy borough commander who commanded
fire forces at the scene in last Friday's fire as well as the one
Monday, said he had found nothing to link the two blazes,
department spokesman John Mulligan said.
   One woman in the building fell but declined medical treatment,
and a second was removed to Bellevue Hospital with possible cardiac
arrest. One firefighter was sent to Bellevue for treatment of smoke
inhalation and heat exhaustion.
   The temperature was about 94 and rising at the time of the fire,
which was reported at 11:34 a.m. and extinguished at 12:12 p.m.
   An off-duty firefighter visiting his brother discovered the fire
and helped to put it out, Mulligan said.
   Between 50 to 100 tenants on the five floors of the tower's
midsection, floors 51 through 56, were evacuated because of the
smoke, said Frank Corbin, a management spokesman for the building.
   The Fire Department initially reported that the fire started in
an electrical conduit in a 50th floor stairwell; later, the
department attributed the cause to the burning carpets.
   On Friday, a fire broke out in an 86th floor shaftway. After it
was brought under control, firefighters discovered that it had
climbed up to the 102nd floor.
   The popular observation decks at both those levels had to be
closed and some 1,500 tourists evacuated.
   In addition to forcing other evacuations because of smoke, the
fire Friday interrupted broadcasting for several hours by eight FM
radio stations whose antennae are atop the building.

<TEXT>
   A feud between the Security Police and
the governing Social Democratic Party is proving to be an
embarrassment to Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson as he campaigns for
next month's general election.
   In the last week, the government's election worries have been
compounded by an exchange of accusations with the secret police of
mischief-making and political spying.
   The feud between the government and its counterintelligence arm,
known as SAPO, goes back decades.
   But the tension resurfaced after book publisher and former
journalist Ebbe Carlsson launched his own investigation into the
1986 assassination of Prime Minister Olof Palme.
   It became clear the amateur detective, an insider in the
governing party, was investigating SAPO as much as looking for the
elusive killer.
   But critics said Social Democrats exceeded their authority and
sidestepped official channels by ordering the secret investigation,
which has overshadowed campaign issues such as taxes or the
environment.
   Justice Minister Anna-Greta Leijon resigned last month after it
was disclosed that she aided Ebbe Carlsson's efforts to contact
British intelligence officials for the investigation.
   SAPO is a department within the regular police structure, and is
responsible for ferreting out spies and protecting Cabinet
ministers.
   Palme, who disliked the formalities of office, dismissed his
SAPO bodyguards when he and his wife went to see a movie on the
night he was killed.
   Prime Minister Carlsson _ not related to Ebbe Carlsson _ told a
parliamentary inquiry Aug. 4 that he backed the investigation
because of ``important allegations and serious criticism against a
Swedish authority.''
   He was referring to charges that SAPO was negligent in
protecting Palme and tried to cover up its shortcomings in the hunt
for the assassin.
   Ebbe Carlsson told the inquiry earlier that SAPO had failed to
act on a tip that Palme's life was in danger. ``If it is not a
conspiracy, it is stupidity,'' he told the televised hearing.
   In another slap at SAPO, Foreign Minister Sten Andersson told
reporters that he trusted Ebbe Carlsson more than he did SAPO's
commanders.
   ``Palme's murder was for many leading Social Democrats the final
confirmation of SAPO's incompetance,'' said a report in the
business weekly Affars Varlden.
   Holger Romander, a former police chief, was quoted as saying the
Carlsson affair ``is part of a campaign against SAPO ... by people
who distrust an organization they cannot control and know little
about.''
   Social Democrats say SAPO is a bastion of conservative politics.
Some party leaders are reported to back removal of SAPO from the
police force so that it would report directly to the government.
   The Svenska Dagbladet newspaper said SAPO urged the government
to reject the credentials last year of a Soviet diplomat whom the
Security Police said was the new KGB station chief. The government
ignored their advice.
   In a book published last week, former SAPO chief Per Gunnar
Vinge wrote that the Social Democrats created a political
intelligence agency during the late 1950s.
   The agency, called the Information Bureau, enlisted personnel in
military or research organizations to register political opinions
of citizens to identify communist sympathizers, the book said. The
activity went on until the early 1970s.
   The Information Bureau story was first published in 1973, and
Prime Minister Carlsson questioned the timing of the book's
publication six weeks before the Sept. 18 election.
   The dispute has helped the three opposition parties cooperate in
their attempt to unseat the Social Democrats, who have governed
Sweden for 50 of the last 56 years.

<HEAD>Media Family Patriarch Dies at 82</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto LX4</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barry Bingham Sr., the patriarch of a
media empire that he sold in 1986 to end a family squabble over
control of the holdings, died Monday at age 82.
   The former owner and publisher of The Courier-Journal and The
Louisville Times had undergone treatment in Boston and Louisville
hospitals since learning he had a brain tumor late last year. His
doctor said Bingham had been in a coma for the past nine days.
   Bingham, whose newspapers won eight Pulitzer Prizes, sold the
two papers in 1986 to Gannett Co., which folded the Times into The
Courier-Journal.
   Many public figures praised Bingham's journalistic and financial
contributions to Kentucky.
   ``He was one of our commonwealth's treasures,'' said former Gov.
A.B. ``Happy'' Chandler, who had his share of feuds with The
Courier-Journal during his half-century in public life.
   ``He was respected for his character, integrity, fair-mindedness
and benevolence of spirit by those on every side of the
controverisal issues of the day,'' said Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky.
   ``The tradition he established serves as a continuing memorial
to his high sense of journalistic responsibility,'' said George N.
Gill, president and publisher of The Courier-Journal.
   Dr. William A. Blodgett, Bingham's personal physician, said he
was with Bingham when he died at home at 5:15 a.m. ``He had a
seizure last weekend, and we believed the tumor was growing
again,'' the doctor said.
   Bingham served as president and publisher of The Courier-Journal
and The Louisville Times from December 1937 until June 1971, when
his son Barry Jr. took over the reins and he became board chairman.
   Since the sale of the media properties _ including the two
papers, a TV station and a printing company, reportedly for $435.8
million _ Bingham had exercised his influence through the Mary and
Barry Bingham Sr. Fund.
   Bingham and his wife established the philanthropic organization
to support education, arts and health endeavors in Kentucky and
southern Indiana. It had distributed more than $8 million by late
last year.
   One of the fund's largest gifts was $2.6 million for the
construction of the 40-story Louisville Falls Fountain, the world's
largest floating fountain, which will be dedicated Friday.
   Bingham placed the media properties on the market in January
1986 after nearly two years of family infighting. He said he
couldn't find a solution that was fair to everyone.
   His illness came as he unsuccessfully fought the release of a
controversial book about his father, Judge Robert Worth Bingham,
who had acquired the newspapers in 1918 with a $5 million
inheritance from his second wife.
   The book alleged that the elder Bingham contributed to his
second wife's death by failing to secure proper medical attention
for her and by drugging her to try to persuade her to change her
will.
   Macmillan Publishing Co. dropped the book project after Bingham
supplied a 5-inch thick memorandum of what he contended were 160
misstatements of fact by author David Chandler. Crown Publishing
Co. issued the book in 1987 after making what it called
insignificant changes.
   The Louisville-born Bingham graduated from Harvard with honors
in 1928, eventually abandoning his dream of becoming a novelist and
joining the newspaper as a police reporter. He took control of the
media empire in 1933 when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt
appointed his father ambassador to Great Britain.
   Judge Bingham had launched WHAS-AM radio in 1922 and later
started Standard Gravure, which prints Sunday magazine and
advertising supplements. Barry Bingham Sr. set up WHAS-TV in 1950;
Barry Bingham Jr. was involved in opening WAMZ-FM.
   Dissension within the family surfaced in 1984 when Sallie
Bingham challenged the ability of her brother to serve as editor
and publisher.
   Sallie Bingham, her sister Eleanor Bingham Miller and their
mother were replaced on the board of directors by professional
managers. Sallie Bingham then announced she was disposing of her 15
percent interest. That eventually led to Bingham's surprise
announcement that he was dismantling the empire.
   In addition to his wife and three children, Bingham is survived
by nine grandchildren. Two other sons died in accidents, in 1964
and 1966.
   A funeral service is scheduled for Wednesday at Calvary
Episcopal Church in Louisville.

<HEAD>Climbers Conquer Everest's Last Unclimbed Ridge, But Fail to Reach
Top</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men have conquered the last unclimbed
area of Mount Everest _ the treacherous northeast ridge _ but they
failed to make it the last 1,000 feet to the 29,028-foot summit.
   ``It is the longest and hardest route on Everest,'' said Russell
Brice of Twizen, New Zealand.
   Brice and Harry Taylor of Oxford, England, completed their climb
the weekend of Aug. 5-7.
   It has been 35 years since Everest was first climbed, yet this
was the first to succeed in reaching the rocky pinnacle atop the
knife-shaped northeast ridge, Brice said in an interview with The
Associated Press in Katmandu after returning from Tibet.
   ``We were both disappointed we did not reach the summit,''
Taylor said. ``But we feel proud we have climbed the unclimbed
ridge ... (and) we are happy. It is a notable (climb) in the
history of Everest.''
   This was the fifth British Everest expedition to tackle the
ridge. Taylor had previously reached the 26,000-foot level on a
1986 expedition.
   The route was pioneered by British alpinist Chris Bonnington six
years ago. Two of Bonnington's British colleagues, Peter Boardman
and Joe Tasker, never returned.
   Brice, 36, said their expedition established its advanced base
camp where the ridge begins, at 21,000 feet in the east Rongbuk
Glacier. Several members went on to Camp 3 at 26,000 feet, where
the pinnacle starts.
   Taylor, 29, said they left Camp 3 early in the morning of Aug. 6
and climbed 14 hours to the pinnacle along the knife-edged ridge,
which was strewn with many cornices.
   ``For the whole way, we had to knock off a foot and a half of
snow before we could climb .... There was no place to stop and sit,
so we could not drink or eat anything on that day.''
   The two stopped climbing after dark and made a ledge to sit on
for the night, in high winds and a heavy snowstorm.
   ``We could sleep only 10 to 15 minutes at a time because of the
cold and lack of oxygen,'' Brice said. But, ``we were not worried
... not scared. We were confident of what we were doing.''
   The next morning, the two climbed for a couple of hours and
reached the top of the pinnacle at 28,000 feet.
   ``We stayed there for two hours hoping to go to the summit (of
Mount Everest),'' Brice said. But ``the weather deteriorated _ from
bad to the worse. The visibility was poor.''
   Asked whether they could have reached the summit if they had
pushed on, Brice replied: ``You can't beat the weather. If we had
gone to the summit we could not have come back.''

<HEAD>Speaker To Return 45 Years After Combat Tour, This Time Leading
Delegation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Forty-five years after Jim Wright flew a
daring World War II bombing mission from a remote Australian
airfield, the speaker of the House is going back _ this time as the
leader of a congressional delegation celebrating the country's
bicentennial.
   ``For me it will be a sentimental journey,'' Wright said,
remembering the 17 hours spent flying over the South Pacific in a
stripped-down B-24 and the midnight bombing of refineries at
Balikpapan, Borneo, where much of Japan's aviation fuel was being
produced.
   The Texas Democrat was a 19-year-old second lieutenant in the
Army Air Corps when he and Capt. Gus Connery flew the lead plane in
the 2,700-mile mission and suprised the Japanese, who had left the
lights on in the harbor at Balikpapan because they thought the
refineries were beyond the range of American bombers.
   On this trip Down Under, he hopes to ``demonstrate to Australia
our appreciation for their steadfast friendship.''
   A meeting with Prime Minister Bob Hawke is on Wright's
itinerary, as the speaker, his wife, Betty, and about a dozen
members of Congress and their spouses attend ceremonies to
inaugurate the new Parliament House in the capital of Canberra.
   The delegation leaves Friday and returns to the United States on
Aug. 31, said Wright, who is organizing the bipartisan group at the
request of the State Department and William Lane, U.S. ambassador
to Australia.
   While in Canberra, Wright and the delegation will attend the
first session of Parliament in the new building and meet with
leaders of the ruling Labor Party and of the opposition party. The
U.S. lawmakers will visit the Australian War Memorial and the
Australian-American War Memorial, and Wright will lay a wreath on
each.
   The Australian air force will fly Wright to Fenton air strip in
the rugged Northern Territory, where he spent much of his combat
tour.
   ``I'll go back for this sentimental journey,'' he said,
reminiscing about the time as a young soldier he bought a wild
horse from a nearby rancher for $48 and fed the animal with oats
intended for his comrades' breakfast.
   He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his valor in
the bombing of the Balikpapan oil refineries, at the time the
longest bombing mission on record. His plane was the first to
arrive over the refineries and the lights immediately went out when
he dropped his bombs.

<HEAD>Governor Seeks Review of Program That Allows Zaccaro to Live in
Luxury Digs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gov. Madeleine Kunin has asked for a
review of a state corrections program that has allowed John Zaccaro
Jr. to spend his four-month prison term for selling cocaine in a
$1,500-a-month apartment.
   Louis Berney, a spokesman for the governor, said Monday Kunin
believes the overall program is outstanding but that she is
concerned about inequities in living accommodations among
participants.
   Zaccaro, the son of former Democratic vice presidential
candidate Geraldine Ferraro, was convicted in April of selling a
quarter-gram of cocaine to an undercover officer while a student at
Middlebury College in 1986. He was sentenced to one to five years
in prison, with all but four months suspended.
   Zaccaro was deemed eligible for the state Corrections
Department's ``house arrest'' program, under which non-violent
convicts can find their own housing while they remain under close
supervision by corrections officials. The program is designed to
ease prison overcrowding.
   Zaccaro is staying in a luxury apartment with room service and
cable TV in a building designed for expense-account business people
on short assignments.
   ``This guy is a drug felon and he's living in conditions that
99.9 percent of the people of Vermont couldn't afford,'' said
Addison County State's Attorney John Quinn, who prosecuted the
24-year-old Zaccaro.
   State corrections officials say they have no control over the
quality of the living quarters. ``The department doesn't provide
the apartment,'' said John Perry, director of planning for
corrections. ``The prisoner does that. We are only concerned that
it meets minimum standards _ no drugs, no guns, no college kids
hanging around.
   ``Obviously, some people, Mr. Zaccaro among them, have more
money than others, and they can afford a better place. The Aga Khan
probably wouldn't think much of his apartment,'' he said.
   ``The governor believes poeple should be treated equally
regardless of personal circumstances,'' so has asked for the
review, said Berney. He said Kunin had no suggestions for solving
the inequities.
   There are a host of problems in trying to regulate the standard
of living quarters. For example, some of the participants live at
home, raising the question of whether the state would force people
from their homes if they seem too luxurious.
   Berney said it was important to remember Zaccaro ``does not have
freedom in any sense of the word. He works most of the time, and is
restricted to his apartment for the rest of the time, with the
exception of one hour a week in which he has to go grocery
shopping.''
   Zaccaro works at a community youth center in Burlington.
   ``He gets a personal visit a day and two phone calls a day from
an officer. He is very closely monitored,'' said Berney.

<HEAD>Stroessner Takes Oath of Office for Eighth Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Alfredo Stroessner took the
oath of office for an eighth time Monday in a subdued ceremony that
followed weeks of tension between the government and the Roman
Catholic Church.
   Stroessner, 75, was sworn in before the congress by the
president of the Supreme Court, Luis Maria Argana. He then quietly
walked off the podium without speaking to assembled representatives
and foreign dignitaries.
   The 25-minute ceremony was broadcast by state-run radio across
this landlocked and mostly rural country of 3.8 million.
   Although there were no protests, the Catholic Church canceled
the annual Te Deum mass of thanksgiving traditionally celebrated on
Aug. 15 to mark the anniversary of the founding of the capital,
Asuncion.
   The cancellation, ordered by Monsignor Ismael Rolon, archbishop
of Asuncion, was a response to the expulsion July 25 of a Spanish
Jesuit priest for allegedly publicly encouraging overthrow of the
government.
   The church denied the charge and said the priest, Juan Antonio
de la Vega, a 65-year-old professor, was explaining Liberation
Theology, a movement that advocates political change as a tool of
social reform.
   The church, the most influential institution in the country
after the government and the military, claimed in a message
delivered from pulpits two weeks ago that it was the victim of
persecution.
   Pope John Paul II urged Stroessner during a visit here last May
to relax restrictions on human rights and political freedom.
Stroessner, also commander of Paraguay's military, took power in a
1954 coup and has ruled with a heavy hand ever since.
   His tenure has brought order and modest economic growth to a
country that had seen turmoil and 11 different presidents in the 19
years following the end of the Chaco War with Bolivia in 1935. But
most civil liberties are curtailed and dissent is crushed.
   Stroessner won an eighth term in February in an election marked
by the absence of the major opposition groups, and by charges of
fraud. He was credited with obtaining 88.6 percent of all votes
cast.
   Monday's inauguration was witnessed by Brazilian Foreign
Minister Roberto de Abreu Sondre, Taiwan's Prime Minister Yu Kuo
and delegations from South Korea, South Africa and neighboring
Argentina.
   Afterward, Stroessner swore in his 11-member Cabinet. Rodney
Elpidio Acevedo replaced Carlos Saldivar as foreign minister.

   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi met with Iranian
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and praised Iran and Iraq for
agreeing to end their war, the Libyan news agency JANA reported
Monday.
   Velayati left Libya Monday after a visit.
   The dispatch from Tripoli, the Libyan capital, did not specify
when or where the two met.
   Col. Gadhafi ``lauded the stances of both Iran and Iraq for
ending the war, calling for the necessity of directing all the guns
against the common Zionist enemy,'' JANA said in a report monitored
in Rome.
   Gadhafi said Libya ``is ready to respond to any sign from the
two sides to solve any complications that may arise in the future.''
   Velayati said Gadhafi had praised Iran's acceptance of U.N.
Resolution 598, which calls for a cease-fire in the 8-year-old war.
Velayati quoted Gadhafi as calling it a ``wise action for ending
the war,'' according to a report from Iran's official Islamic
Republic News Agency, monitored in Libya.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar announced the
cease-fire last week, and said it would take effect Aug. 20.

<HEAD>Soviets Warn Pakistan; Rebels Take District Near Kabul</HEAD>
<HEAD>Inserts 1 graf after 10th `Soviet military' with casualty figures
form Tass and Najib</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

   The Kremlin said Monday it will not tolerate more
Pakistani aid to Moslem guerrillas in Afghanistan, who increased
pressure on the Soviet-sponsored government by capturing a district
near Kabul, the capital.
   Insurgent leader Gulbaddin Hekmatyar said in Pakistan that
guerrilla successes in the field may cause the Soviets to complete
their troop withdrawal ahead of the Feb. 15 deadline. He said his
forces had captured Shigal, a strategic post in Kunar province near
the Pakistani border.
   A Soviet government statement issued through the official news
agency Tass contained some of the sharpest language the Kremlin has
aimed at Pakistan.
   ``The Soviet government most resolutely declares that the
continuation by Pakistan of its obstructionist policy vis-a-vis the
Geneva accords on Afghanistan cannot be further tolerated,'' it
said.
   ``The Soviet Union reserves for itself, in that case, the right
to take such measures that are necessitated by the situation.'' It
was not specific about the response.
   On May 15, the Soviet Union began withdrawing its estimated
115,000 soldiers from Afghanistan under an agreement signed April
14 in Geneva by Afghanistan and Pakistan, with the Soviet Union and
United States as guarantors.
   Half the soldiers were to be out by Aug. 15, which the Soviets
said Sunday had been achieved, and all are to be gone by Feb. 15.
   President Najib of Afghanistan marked the occasion with an
article in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda thanking the Soviet
Union for its help.
   With the article, Pravda printed a map showing the remaining
Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan along two evacuation routes, from
Kabul and from Shindand via Herat in the west.
   Soviet military officials said earlier the pullout had cleared
the Red Army from 25 of Afghanistan's 30 provinces. The map showed
soldiers in only a narrow ribbon through the remaining five
provinces.
   Tass said 31 civilians were killed and 113 wounded in 142
attacks on populated areas in the first 10 days of August. Najib
said at a news conference in Kabul there are more than 180
guerrilla training centers in Pakistan and 50 bases for rearming
rebels and storing weapons.
   The Geneva agreement calls for other countries not to interfere
in Afghanistan's internal affairs. Guerrilla groups were not
parties to the accord.
   Red Army soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979, replaced
one pro-Soviet government with another, and remained to fight the
insurgents. More than 13,000 Soviet soldiers have been killed.
   Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in April
1978 and use Pakistani border camps and cities, where more than 3
million Afghan refugees live, as supply points and bases. The
United States and other countries have armed them through Pakistan.
   Tass said Monday fighters from insurgent groups had captured the
Shakardar district about 20 miles north of Kabul. It quoted reports
in Kabul as saying they were armed with 1,500 rockets they intended
to aim at the capital.
   Other guerrilla organizations planned to send large forces armed
with ``long-range weapons, rockets and Stinger missiles'' from
Pakistan to the Karabag, Pagman and Sorubi districts of Kabul
province, the agency said.
   Lt. Gen. Boris T. Gromov, Soviet commander in Afghanistan, said
Sunday that insurgents had captured Kunduz, a northern provincial
capital 40 miles from the Soviet border.
   Afghanistan Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil, who arrived in Moscow
on Sunday, told a news conference that reports of the fall of
Kunduz were ``fabrication and misinformation.''
   When told Gromov announced it, Wakil said the general's
statement was not ``authentic.''
   ``What is authentic and reliable is the statements made by the
government of Afghanistan,'' he said.
   ``Several days ago Kunduz faced a barbarous and ferocious
attack,'' but insurgents could not be considered in control unless
they established institutions such as schools and hospitals.
   ``The fact is that they do not have any kind of administration
over there,'' he said.
   Najib said Monday soldiers had recaptured the city. Hekmatyar,
leader of the Hezb-i-Islami guerrillas, said his information
indicated fighting continued near Kunduz.
   Wakil did not respond directly when asked whether there were
circumstances under which the Soviets might stop withdrawing.
   He cited a joint statement issued Aug. 7 when Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze was in Kabul saying the two sides would
``draw the necessary conclusions and determine their actions'' if
Pakistan continued to aid the insurgents.
   Shevardnadze said in an interview the same day, however, that
the withdrawal would finish on schedule.
   Hekmatyar claimed Moscow had wanted to remove partial units from
eastern, southern and southwestern Afghanistan to make things
easier for Afghan government forces, but that proved too dangerous
so entire units have been withdrawn.
   ``The Soviets are not leaving because of a Geneva agreement but
because they see no gain,'' he said. ``They are forced to leave.''

<HEAD>Former Bush Rivals Get on Bandwagon for November</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts new grafs 19-20 with Robertson quote, ``Arriving in
xxx''</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   It wasn't too long ago that they were a pack
of bickering rivals, six would-be presidents sniping and squabbling
in public over who could best lead the Republicans to victory in
November.
   George Bush was most often the target of the other five, who
never hesitated to list his shortcomings.
   But all that is forgotten now, as Bob Dole, Jack Kemp, Alexander
Haig Jr., Pete du Pont and Pat Robertson join the Republican
convention this week in singing Bush's praises.
   While Bush is the undisputed star of the GOP unity fest, the
other five are by no means shrinking violets during the week's
activities.
   Two are busily keeping themselves at the front of the vice
presidential sweepstakes; three will be prominently featured in
prime-time slots at the convention; and all five are making the
rounds with delegate speeches, media interviews and receptions in
their honor.
   Each of the former candidates was given a spot to address the
convention hall, du Pont and Haig shortly after the opening gavel
on Monday morning, and Robertson, Kemp and Dole in the prized
prime-time slots at evening sessions.
   Du Pont, in an eloquent version of the message he has been
delivering since his dismal showing in the primaries, said the
Democrats are looking to the policies of yesterday while Bush and
the Republicans are the ``party willing to explore, examine and put
new ideas to work.''
   ``You have to feel a little wistful,'' the former Delaware
governor said in an interview when asked about seeing Bush receive
the party's nomination. ``I love the process, I enjoyed what I was
doing, I'd love to still be doing it. But George was a little
stronger this year.''
   Haig, the former secretary of state who has served under seven
presidents, said he will join Bush's surrogate speaking team and
``do everything I can to get George Bush elected president.''
   Haig, who often directed the most pointed barbs at Bush during
GOP primary debates, said in an interview Monday that Bush ``is as
well qualified a candidate as our party has ever put forward.''
   ``We're in New Orleans to unify our party, to endorse our worthy
nominee George Bush,'' he told the delegates Monday.
   Dole, the senator from Kansas and Kemp, the New York
congressman, meanwhile, have been dashing around New Orleans
campaign-style _ from breakfasts to receptions to luncheon speeches
to interviews and TV shows.
   Both are said to be on Bush's short list as he deliberates who
will be his running mate and both have said they would accept the
job.
   At a breakfast sponsored by Bell South on Monday, Dole thanked
his primary supporters. But he added, ``That's behind us and now
we're on to the big event where George Bush will become the 41st
president of the United States.''
   Wife Elizabeth sounded as if she were promoting her husband for
the second spot on the ticket, saying, ``I was very proud of the
fact that literally a week after Bob withdrew from the presidential
race he was out working hard, and I mean hard, for George Bush. He
doesn't look back.''
   Kemp, being pushed for the second spot by conservatives, has a
full schedule. He's encouraging Republican enthusiasm for the
party's conservative platform and attacking the Democratic ticket
of Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen.
   But mostly, Kemp is stirring up support for his own vice
presidential ambitions, saying Monday that he ``could be a good
second string quarterback for George Bush.''
   Robertson, the television evangelist who raised $25 million but
failed to attract significant voter support, has set up a large
campaign office near the French Quarter. But so far there seems to
have been little activity in the office.
   Arriving in New Orleans on Monday, Robertson spoke party unity
but insisted that the conservative views he espoused will be
vindicated in the election this fall.
   ``We are getting ready to show why Republicans should be elected
next fall and why George Bush should be the next president of the
United States,'' he said.
   Robertson is to address the convention Tuesday night, and will
be honored at a rally afterward.
   Robertson announced last week that he would not enter his name
into nomination, removing the last potential wave on the otherwise
smooth convention waters.

<HEAD>Dukakis Dismisses Reagan Criticism; Says Leadership Is The True
`L' Word</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SHREWSBURY, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis on Monday dismissed President Reagan's criticism of him as
a ``liberal, liberal, liberal,'' saying Republicans have turned
their backs on basic American values and that ``the `L' word in
this campaign is leadership.''
   The Massachusetts governor, on his annual visit to the central
part of his home state, said he was not fazed by criticism of him
at the Republican National Convention and predicted Reagan's
personal popularity would not help certain Republican nominee
George Bush.
   ``In the last analysis, people are going to be looking at me and
Mr. Bush and they are going to be looking at which one of us has
the leadership,'' Dukakis told reporters. He noted that Reagan
campaigned actively for GOP Senate candidates in 1986 but could not
keep Democrats from regaining control of the Senate.
   Dukakis talked with reporters after attending an event to mark
the first phase in implementing the state's universal health care
law, which guarantees health insurance to virtually all workers by
1990.
   On arriving in New Orleans on Sunday, Reagan said: ``It's time
to talk issues, to use the dreaded `L' word. To say the policies of
our opposition and the congressional leadership of his party are
liberal, liberal, liberal.'' He also accused the Democrats of
stealing the theme of family values that Reagan said had helped
fuel the Republican resurgence.
   Dukakis said he does not think such criticism of him will cause
lasting political damage.
   ``The `L' word in this campaign is leadership,'' Dukakis said.
``This isn't about the past. It's not about the '70s or the '30s.
It's about the '90s. ...The `L' word is leadership. That's why I'm
running for president.''
   Dukakis used the health-care event to tout his record as
Massachusetts governor on issues that affect the family, citing his
work to expand opportunities for day care and affordable housing as
well.
   He called basic health care ``a birthright of every American''
and added: ``That's something the Republican party has never
understood.''
   Dukakis said he could not provide a figure of how much such a
program would cost on a national level but said he hoped most of it
could be financed through minor increases in insurance premiums
with the possibility of using government money to get the program
rolling That is the case in Massachusetts, where $65 million has
been allocated for the first two years.
   At Monday's event with Dukakis were several disabled people who
will get health insurance through the new program _ allowing
several of them to work for the first time.
   The central Massachusetts trip is an annual event for Dukakis,
who will return to the region Tuesday. He recited his
administration's efforts to bring the region back from an economic
depression and said he wasn't sure if he would be back next year.
   ``Fate will tell us in a little less than three months,'' he
said.
   After the luncheon and health-care event, Dukakis toured a
metals factory in Westboro before returning home for the night.
   The governor issued a statement calling for a Cabinet-level
council to oversee the nation's space program and said he would
support deployment of a permanently manned space station.
   At the news conference, Dukakis said the startup money for the
station _ which aides said would be about $900 million in the first
year _ would be taken from cuts in some weapons programs and from
more efficient Pentagon management.
   Dukakis endorsed the space station for the first time as his
running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, toured the Johnson Space
Flight Center in Houston.
   Dukakis also continued to blame Reagan for the increase in the
prime interest rate to 10 percent, saying the higher lending rate
resulted from Reagan's continued ``borrowing and spending,
borrowing and spending, borrowing and spending.''
   Dukakis is scheduled to be in his home state through Wednesday,
when he will begin a campaign trip to Minnesota, Alabama, Florida,
Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas and Texas.

   Cattle Numbers For Slaughter Market Rose Last Month
   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Cattle being fed for the slaughter market as
of Aug. 1 in the seven major beef states totaled 6.84 million head,
up 2 percent from a year ago and 8 percent more than inventories of
two years ago, the Agriculture Department said Monday.
   The placement of new cattle and calves in fattening pens last
month was reported at 1.25 million head, down 2 percent from a year
ago and down 10 percent from two years ago.
   Marketings of ``fed'' cattle in July totaled 1.77 million head,
up 4 percent from a year ago and also up 4 percent from two years
ago. Officials said those were the most July feedlot marketings
since the seven-state estimates began in 1972.
   As of Aug. 1, feedlot inventories were larger than a year
earlier in California, Colorado, Kansas and Nebraska but were
smaller in Arizona, Iowa and Texas. The seven states produce about
three-fourths of the nation's beef.
   State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the seven
states. The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as
of Aug. 1, and the second number is the percentage of a year
earlier.

<TEXT>
   Lone wolf, maverick, member of an extremely
small group of conservative U.S. senators _ Gordon Humphrey
identifies with all those characterizations and says he doesn't
care as long as George Bush is listening closely.
   ``I run with a pretty small pack,'' the self-proclaimed and sole
congressional spokesman for the Coalition for a Winning Ticket said
late Sunday night. ``I didn't come here to blend in with the
wallpaper. I'm going to compete within the bounds of civility up to
the end to put forth my agenda.''
   Thus far, Humphrey's effort to pressure Bush into naming a
conservative running mate has attracted tremendous media coverage.
   Humphrey planned it that way. ``If there weren't a news vacuum
at this convention, we wouldn't really get the attention, but I saw
the chance and, quite frankly, decided to exploit it,'' he said.
   Humphrey acknowledges that all the noise won't win victory on
the convention floor if he had to take it to a roll call vote.
   ``We'd be beaten,'' he said.
   So why fight Bush campaign attempts to create harmony?
   ``We're trying to sensitize him and particularly his advisers.''
Humphrey said. ``Bush people are tone deaf. They are so isolated
from the majority of the party.''
   Humphrey, 47, a former airline pilot, narrowly defeated 16-year
incumbent Sen. Thomas McIntyre, a Democrat, in what was viewed as a
major upset in 1978. It was Humphrey's first try for public office.
He promised to be the ``toughest skinflint in the U.S. Senate.''
   Humphrey has since carved a niche in the Senate as the leading
spokesman against abortion. He is a fiscal conservative, strongly
anti-communist and an advocate for the freedom fighters in
Afghanistan.
   ``I do not try to be all things to all people,'' he says of his
essentially unyielding positions. ``People either like the kind of
representation I give them or they don't.''
   When Bush named New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean as keynote speaker,
Humphrey threatened to stage a boycott unless Bush allowed an
abortion opponent to speak. Humphrey later announced he was
satisfied with the Bush campaign's promise to let Congressman Henry
Hyde of Illinois to speak on the issue.
   ``I've made that (abortion) a real point of leadership,'' he
said. ``That riles some people.''
   Humphrey also believes that many agree that the vice
presidential nominee should be anti-abortion, fiscally conservative
and strong on defense, but are afraid to speak out.
   ``If I wasn't raising hell, who would be?'' he asked.
   Humphrey says he doesn't really want to force the convention to
consider an alternative nominee, but he will try if Bush picks a
moderate. Even in losing, an alternative nominee would be able to
reassure conservatives ``the movement is still there and lives.''
   ``As long as I don't overplay my hand or become uncivil, I don't
see any downside for conservatives,'' he said. ``Right now, we're
shut out.''

<TEXT>
   More than 300 miners Monday protested
dangerous working conditions and the lockout of three Solidarity
leaders at a copper mine.
   Jacek Kuron, a spokesman for the outlawed union, said workers
staged a rally at the Rudna mine in southwestern Poland after
managers failed to fulfill promises made after a strike in May.
   The workers also demanded that the Solidarity leaders _ members
of a commission fighting for improved safety at the mine _ be
allowed to return to work, Kuron said. The three men have not been
fired, but were ordered to turn in their identity cards Saturday.
   The Rudna copper mine has been the scene of frequent unrest.
Managers ended the strike in May by agreeing to improve safety, but
failed to meet Monday's deadline for implementing the changes.
Kuron said the miners planned another rally Tuesday.
   Solidarity activists say the miners are working in dangerously
high temperatures with poor ventilation.
   Safety issues have not been addressed by the officially
sanctioned trade union at Rudna. However, that group has pressed
for higher pay.
   Kuron said the miners also demanded the right to form
independent trade unions. Solidarity has been suppressed since
1981, when Poland's communist leaders imposed martial law. It was
banned by parliament the next year.

   They talk about plant closings _ we want to continue plant
openings. They see America in terms of its limits _ we see America
in terms of its possibilities.
   If we do our job right, I predict that by 1992 _ the start of
George Bush's second term _ one-quarter of our party will consist
of black, Hispanic, and Asian-Americans, who will see in our party
the best hope of a better life for themselves and their families.
   What's the real purpose of the Reagan revolution? It wasn't to
defeat Democrats. It was to bring new ideas and superior
leadership, to restore confidence in America. Like the American
Revolution itself, the greatness of our revolution is measured, not
by who we're against, but by what we're for.
   Last month in Atlanta, the leaders of the Democratic Party
failed to say what they're for. All they said was who they're
against. They all said, ``We can't stand another eight years of
Republican policies.'' Of course they can't. It's clear that Ted
Kennedy, Jim Wright, and Michael Dukakis can't stand another eight
years of Republican policies: because that means another 5 million
new employers _ and another 17 million new jobs. At that rate, all
their constituents will become Republicans.
   This is no time to stop. This is no time to go back. We have a
lot of work to do. We dn't just want low inflation _ we want no
inflation. We don't just want low unemployment _ we want no
unemployment. We need a safety net to keep people from falling _
but we also need a ladder of opportunity upon which all can climb.
   We don't just want to oppose communism _ we want to support men
and women who are fighting for freedom and democracy, whether in
Afghanistan, Angola or Central America. We want to free people, not
only from too much dependence on government _ we want to free them
from dependence on drugs, and the disrespect for human life.
   Mr. President, you've brought us to the threshold of a new era.
In fact, you've taken us over the threshold. You've shown us that
we can do more than contain our adversaries _ we can transcend
them. You've shown us how we can make even the threat of nuclear
war obsolete, through the now-proven technology of strategic
defense. You've reminded us that the first and best Department of
Health, Education and Welfare is a strong family. And you've shown
us that the power of a right idea is the greatest force on Earth.
   Mr. President, this is a powerful legacy that you are handing us
here in New Orleans. I just want you and Nancy to know that, under
the able leadership of George Bush, this party is going to take it
and run with it.
   We're going to win in November. We're going to finish what we
began in 1980: To help all Americans _ to help people everywhere _
to share in the success of freedom, democracy, and peace.
   Thank you, and God bless you.

<HEAD>Pilot: Elvis' First Disc Sitting in Bank</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK HAMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elvis Presley's high school buddy said Monday he
has the King's first recording, a highly sought two-song disc
Presley made for his mother in 1953.
   Edwin S. Leek Jr., a retired airline pilot, said in a telephone
interview that Elvis left the record at Leek's grandmother's house
in Memphis 25 years ago.
   ``I saw him a few years later in Chicago, when he was first
starting to make it, and I said, `I still have that first record of
yours. It's going to be worth a lot of money some day.'''
   Presley's reply, according to Leek: ``Just hold onto it.''
   ``I've been telling my wife, `What are we gonna do with it? All
we've ever done it lock it away,''' Leek said. ``Now I'd like to
find out what it's worth.''
   Todd Morgan of Graceland, the Presley home and museum in
Memphis, said the museum had long ``kept an eye open'' for the
record, which he described as ``probably the single most valuable
record in record collecting. It's the first record of the man who
pioneered rock 'n roll.''
   Presley's first recording led directly to his discovery, and one
Elvis expert describes it as ``extremely valuable.''
   The disc's existence was reported in this week's edition of
Goldmine magazine, a journal for record collectors.
   ``It sounds like early Presley, slow, romantic _ it's not rock
'n' roll,'' according to Kit Kiefer, Goldmine managing editor, who
said he had listened to tapes provided by Leek. ``The sound isn't
CD quality, but it's surprisingly good.''
   Asked if the magazine suspected a hoax, he said, ``I've heard a
lot of Elvis imitators, and none of them go for the immature Elvis
sound. Also, everything (Leek) said checks out.''
   In 1953, Presley, an 18-year-old truck driver, wanted to make a
record as a present for his mother. He went to the Memphis
Recording Service, paid $4 and _ accompanying himself on acoustic
guitar _ sang two ballads: ``My Happiness'' and ``That's When Your
Heartaches Begin.''
   The studio was owned by Sam Phillips, head of Sun Records, which
shared the premises. One of the employees liked Presley's disc and
called him to Phillips' attention.
   The first disc was long known to have been made, but no one has
been able to determine what happened to it, Morgan said.
   Leek said that for years he kept the Presley disc with his
wife's records, and later placed it in a bank safety deposit box
after they moved to Key Largo, Fla.
   Leek said he will auction off the record if he can get a
reasonable price. He also hopes to sell what he said was an
autographed copy of Presley's first Sun release, ``That's All Right
(Mama).''
   Leek said he met Elvis in 1945 when they shared a class in high
school. He said Presley frequently visited Leek's grandmother, who
had a piano young Presley liked to play. Leek's grandmother
expressed an interest in the record he'd made, and Presley brought
it over and played it for her, Leek said.
   Presley forgot to take it with him when he left, Leek said.

<HEAD>OMB Concedes $1.2 Billion Error in Budget Deficit Estimate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $1.2 billion mathematical error by the
Reagan administration in calculating the size of next year's
federal deficit could spark a fight with Congress when lawmakers
return to the capital next month.
   The mistaken estimate, which under the Gramm-Rudman balanced
budget law cannot be rectified, is preventing the spending of $1.2
billion at a time when legislators are struggling to decide which
among several competing spending bills they will pass.
   Among them are programs to combat drugs and to help the homeless
and the hungry.
   The White House Office of Management and Budget is estimating
that spending bills for fiscal 1989 passed by Congress so far leave
the government with a deficit of about $144.2 billion.
   Under the Gramm-Rudman law, if next year's deficit surpasses
$146 billion, there will be automatic spending cuts of at least $10
billion.
   But OMB officials confirmed last week that they have pointed out
to lawmakers that their estimate of the deficit was in error and
should have been $143 billion.
   ``We don't know,'' OMB spokeswoman Barbara Clay said when asked
how the error occurred.
   Some Democrats, questioned last week, said that with increasing
pressures to spend money on various programs, lawmakers may have to
consider passing legislation that would free up the $1.2 billion.
   ``If it's an error and does not reflect in fact where we stand,
it's an option that should be considered,'' said Rep. Leon Panetta,
D-Calif., who is expected to become chairman of the House Budget
Committee next year.
   But in a prepared statement, administration budget director
James C. Miller III said he would ``oppose any tinkering'' with the
law ``for purposes that would increase the deficit.''
   As the $1.1 trillion federal budget goes, $1.2 billion normally
would barely register a tick. But with OMB calculating that the
1989 deficit is coming so close to the Gramm-Rudman target of $146
billion, every dollar counts.
   The bills lawmakers would like to pass _ or that President
Reagan has not yet signed into law _ would exceed $1.8 billion in
spending.
   Under the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law, OMB analyzes the
economy and federal spending and revenues several times annually,
projecting how much red ink is likely in the coming fiscal year.
   If the final numbers show that the deficit will exceed a target
set by the law _ it is $146 billion for next year _ spending is
automatically cut by at least $10 billion. That is a scenario
Congress and President Reagan have desperately sought to avoid.
   OMB first made the error when calculating the rate of spending
in a foreign military sales program in an August 1987 deficit
report.
   OMB noticed the mistake soon afterward, and made a slight
correction. But provisions in the Gramm-Rudman law prohibit OMB
from making dramatic changes in its projections on how quickly
money provided by Congress is actually spent by agencies.
   Congress wrote that provision to prevent the executive branch
agency from using bogus estimates to clamp down on allowable
spending.
   Yet another part of the Gramm-Rudman law forbids OMB from making
any changes in its deficit projection this close to the new fiscal
year, except for new programs enacted into law. Fiscal 1989 begins
on Oct. 1.
   ``We're locked in by Gramm-Rudman,'' Clay said.
   For legislation not yet enacted this year, the cost of a
wide-ranging drug bill has not been officially estimated, but it is
believed that its cost will exceed $1 billion.
   In addition, OMB estimates that the trade bill would cost $400
million; hunger relief would cost $300 million; and welfare reform
would cost $200 million to $500 million. In addition, a measure
primarily devoted to emergency spending for 1988 also contains $100
million for 1989.

<HEAD>Convention Rules Committee Rejects Veep Roll Call</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A conservative group pushing for a roll call
vote for the Republican vice presidential nomination lost one round
Monday when a convention committee voted to scrap the
time-consuming ritual to conserve television time.
   However, Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., chairman of the group
calling itself the ``Coalition for a Winning Ticket,'' said that he
was prepared to carry the fight to the convention floor, possibly
putting up a rival candidate for vice president to keep the process
open.
   ``Every dictator in history has wanted to make the trains run on
time,'' Humphrey said at a news conference after his proposal died
before the Republican National Convention's Rules Committee.
``There is no more foolish thing in politics than seeking to stifle
dissent.''
   Humphrey has been outspoken in recent weeks in urging George
Bush to choose a conservative as his vice presidential running
mate. Bush has not said who he will ask to join him on the ticket.
   Now Humphrey and his group object to a rules change that would
dispense with a state-by-state roll call vote on the GOP vice
presidential nomination if only one candidate's name is placed in
nomination. In effect, the rules change, if adopted by the entire
convention, would allow delegates to vote only on whether the
nomination should be made unanimous.
   Haley Barbour of Mississippi, who proposed the change in the
rules, said it is to let the party use prime-time television more
productively.
   ``Are we going to take 45 minutes of George Bush and the
Republican Party's valuable time and waste it on an uncontested
nomination?'' Barbour asked during the rules committee meeting.
   Humphrey, who is not a member of the committee, was allowed to
speak to the panel. But when delegate Duane Mutch of North Dakota
tried to bring Humphrey's proposal up for a vote, he was ruled out
of order.
   When the entire set of GOP rules came up for a vote, only one
dissenting voice was heard.
   Humphrey said later that he would try to line up the five state
delegations necessary under the rules to put another vice
presidential candidate's name in nomination. He said he had nobody
in particular in mind and refused to name which states he was
targeting.

<HEAD>Americans Gather To Plan `Peace Walk' In Soviet Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 200 Americans from 30 states converged
on Washington Monday to prepare for a 2,000-mile ``peace walk'' in
the Soviet Union to dramatize a call for ending the superpower arms
race, organizers said.
   The walkers plan to fly to Moscow on Thursday and begin their
march in Odessa, on the Black Sea coast, on Saturday, said Allan
Affeldt, president of International Peace Walk, a Washington-based
peace group that has organized the project.
   The Americans are to be joined in Odessa by about 200 Soviet
citizens, and the two groups plan to walk together back to Moscow,
stopping first in Kiev, in the Ukraine. The Americans are to fly
back to Washington on Sept. 15, Affeldt said.
   He said the Soviet government placed no restrictions on the
walkers' activities, which will include visits to Soviet homes,
public meetings on political and social topics and brief stops at
Soviet farms to help with the harvest.
   Affeldt said the event would mark the largest number of
Americans ever to travel together in a Soviet republic other than
Russia. Their ages range from pre-teens to mid-70s, he said.
   The aim of the walk, he said, was to improve understanding
between Soviet and American citizens and erode the distrust that
has helped perpetuate the arms race.
   ``We're being citizen diplomats, making our statement in as
dramatic a way as possible,'' Affeldt said in a telephone interview.
   The trip's costs are to be borne partly by the walkers and
partly by Affeldt's organization, which gets its money from private
donations and grants, he said.

<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin said Monday his order confining 650,000 Palestinians to their
homes under a military curfew was a clear message that Israel was
cracking down on protesters.
   In the occupied West Bank, Israeli troops shot and killed a
Palestinian, bringing the Arab death toll in more than eight months
of anti-Israeli violence to 245, according to United Nations
figures.
   The around-the-clock curfew was imposed indefinitely on this
seaside strip Sunday evening following a violent weekend in the
occupied lands in which three Arabs died. Troops shot and wounded
25 people in Gaza on Sunday, according to Arab reports.
   It was only the third time the army had sealed off the Gaza
Strip since the uprising began Dec. 8. Rabin said the curfew, which
kept about 50,000 Gazans away from jobs in Israel, would be in
effect ``as long as it is needed.''
   Some Israeli sources speculated the move was related not to
resurgent violence but to an effort to put economic pressure on the
650,000 residents of Gaza.
   In Arab east Jerusalem, Palestinian protesters threw rocks at
police and at an Israeli bus near the walled Old City, slightly
injuring three American tourists, police said.
   An official at Hadassa Hospital identified the Americans as
brother and sisters Abraham, Dina and Shoshana Kai. The official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the three teen-agers were
released after treatment. He did not have their hometown.
   Scattered protests broke out Monday despite the curfew, and
Palestinian reports said two residents of the Jabaliya refugee camp
on the outskirts of Gaza City were wounded in the legs by army
gunfire.
   Reporters were allowed into the strip only with Israeli army
escorts to tour with Rabin.
   ``We have delivered a clear-cut message ... that violence will
be met by force,'' Rabin said, standing in the road near the site
where a firebomb hurled at a van Sunday burned six Israelis, one of
them an 8-month-old infant.
   ``The population ... must realize that if they take the law into
their own hands, throwing firebombs, stones and putting up
roadblocks, this will lead nowhere and they will be the ones to
suffer.''
   Rabin said earlier that soldiers had been ordered to ``shoot to
hit'' anyone caught throwing a firebomb and that the homes of
suspects would be torn down without right of appeal.
   Yigal Kaminetzky, the chief rabbi of Jewish settlers in Gaza,
called for tough measures to prevent further firebomb attacks,
including clearing both sides of the road for 50 yards in both
rural and built-up residential areas.
   During Rabin's tour Monday, Arab youths darted out from behind
garbage dumpsters and brick walls to hurl rocks at a 12-car
military convoy carrying reporters and military offixcials.
   The convoy stopped several times to chase away protesters, but
no shots were fired.
   In Gaza City, Palestinians violating the curfew dropped a large
rock on top of a van carrying an Israeli television crew, but no
one was hurt.
   Protesters also set tires on fire in the middle of roads and
scrawled slogans on walls.
   Most streets were deserted, but an Arab witness who spoke on
condition of anonymity said soldiers forced some residents to
whitewash graffiti or clear away debris.
   Rabin said the army would concentrate on breaking the power of
autonomous Palestinian ``popular committees,'' which have been
orchestrating protests at the neighborhood and village level.
   He attributed the unrest to a show of force by Moslem
fundamentalists, who called for demonstrations to mark the start of
the Islamic new year 1409.
   Palestinians traced the weekend protests to the arson deaths of
two Gaza workers who were trapped in a shed that was set on fire
near Tel Aviv. Police said Jewish extremists may have been involved.
   In the occupied West Bank, hospital officials said 21-year-old
Jamal Odeh of Tulkarm refugee camp was dead on arrival after being
shot in the heart during overnight clashes.
   Troops shot an 18-year-old Palestinian in the right leg after
youths threw rocks on soldiers in the old city marketplace, and a
second 18-year-old was hit in the eye with a rubber bullet, Nablus
hospital officials said.
   Israeli officials expressed mixed reactions to suggestions from
senior PLO official Salah Khalaf that a ``completely new'' PLO
charter might include recognition of Israel.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, the dovish Labor Party leader,
called for clarifications.
   ``Whoever wants negotiations should say so clearly. What has
been said until now is a jigsaw puzzle,'' Peres told reporters.
   But a spokesman for right-wing Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
described Khalaf's statements as ``verbal trickery.''
   ``We have to watch what they do, not what they say,'' said
spokesman Yossi Ahimeir.

   George Bush conceded Monday he has a hard act
to follow but hopes to leave his personal stamp on the Republican
National Convention and ``not try to be a Ronald Reagan. There is
only one.''
   The vice president spent his last day here putting finishing
touches on his acceptance speech and maintaining his silence on his
choice of a running mate. He planned to watch Reagan's evening
speech to the convention on television before flying to New Orleans
on Tuesday morning.
   As of late Monday, Bush still had not made up his mind on a
running mate, although was likely to do so Tuesday before his
arrival in New Orleans, said spokeswoman Sheila Tate.
   ``He's going to call the schedule the way he sees fit,'' she
said. ``He knows that if he tells one person, it will leak.''
   Ms. Tate said Bush still plans to announce his choice Thursday
morning, although she would not rule out the possiblity that the
announcement might be moved up to Wednesday night.
   Bush spent two sessions on Monday working on a final draft of
his acceptance speech with speechwriter Peggy Noonan and was
``pretty well finished'' with it, Ms. Tate said.
   Making the rounds of morning television interview shows, Bush
said that while he had narrowed his choice of a running mate he
still had not made the final decision, even in his own mind.
   Asked whether he expected to be compared with Reagan, Bush told
NBC's ``Today'' show he felt such comparisons were inevitable
``because he's been a great president. He deserves tribute, not
only of the Republican party but of a grateful nation. And so there
will be some comparison of that nature.''
   ``I'm not going to try to be a Ronald Reagan,'' he continued.
``There is only one. I want to be George Bush.''
   Bush also told NBC the ``pressure is mounting'' as he nears the
time of nomination.
   But he also said that as ``an athlete,'' he'd been ``in pressure
situations before, maybe none this intense. But, look, all I'll do
is just stand up there and say what I believe about peace and what
I believe in about prosperity.''
   In an interview on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' Bush said,
``I want to stand up there on Thursday, pay tribute to what we have
done, and give the president plenty of credit for bringing this
country to new heights, and then say what I, George Bush, will do
on peace and on keeping this recovery going until everybody
benefits.
   ``So it's a big moment for me, the culmination of a lot of years
in politics. But I don't feel concerned about it. I've got to be
what I am and I'm not going to be like someone else.''
   On the subject of a vice presidential choice, Bush told ABC, ``I
have not decided. And I probably will say when I have decided. But
I'm going to continue with this appropriate plan, making a decision
in private and then presenting it at the appropriate time.''
   Bush also said he hoped to make maximum use of his family at the
convention, including his five children, their spouses and his 10
grandchildren.
   ``I've always protected the privacy and the wonder of our
family,'' he told CBS' ``Morning News.'' But he added, ``I've had
to lighten up and say to the world, I guess, through this
convention, this is what makes me tick.
   ``I thought Governor Dukakis did a good job on that (showing off
his family) at the Democratic convention. But we've got him
outnumbered, we've got a stronger bench, and we've got a great
family.''

   Georgia Republicans, gambling that Rep. Pat
Swindall will be vindicated by a House ethics committee
investigation, voted Monday to elect him chairman of the state
delegation to the Republican National Convention.
   Swindall's election in a unanimous vote came at a rowdy caucus
at which delegates were poised to elect Brant Frost IV of Macon,
Ga., a leader of a faction dominated by supporters of former
presidential candidate Pat Robertson, the television evangelist.
   Then, Oscar Persons, an Atlanta lawyer nominated Swindall, a
born-again Christian with wide support among the Robertson faction.
Frost withdrew and endorsed Swindall.
   The Robertson faction, which won control of the delegation in
the credentials fight, demonstrated its clout by beating back the
faction led by party regulars in a series of procedural roll call
votes.
   The selection of Swindall by party leaders came less than two
months after the same GOP officials met privately to decide whether
to launch their own investigation of Swindall.
   Those meetings were prompted by revelations about an on-going
federal undercover investigation of Swindall. Tape recordings from
the investigation, obtained by Atlanta newspapers, showed that
Swindall had continued to pursue an $850,000 home construction loan
after he was told it likely would be financed with drug money he
would be helping to launder.
   The Georgia GOP decided not to conduct its own investigation,
but the House ethics committee, formally known as the Committee on
Standards of Official Conduct, launched a probe of Swindall in June
to determine if he had violated the law or House rules.
   Swindall, who requested the ethics committee probe, apologized
for his role in the loan negotiations at a news conference in June.
He said he was wrong and ashamed but would continue to seek
re-election.

   The Republican Platform Committee gave its
final assent Monday to a ``conservative but ... compassionate''
platform and sent it to the full GOP national convention with only
two dissenting votes.
   Most of the 106 members of the Platform Committee shouted an
enthusiastic approval to the 40,000-word document, which will be
presented to the full convention Tuesday. Thhe only ``no'' votes
were cast by Connecticut's two platform committee members, Sen.
Lowell P. Weicker Jr. and Mary Boatwright.
   After the voice vote, Weicker demanded a show of hands but it
was curtailed without a formal count after Sen. Bob Kasten of
Wisconsin, the co-chairman, looked at all the arms raised in
support of the platform.
   There were no minority reports, which means there will be no
debate on the convention floor Tuesday over any of the planks.
   The platform, ``An American Vision: For Our Children and Our
Future,'' includes a firm pledge against tax increases, calls for
``rapid and certain deployment'' of the Strategic Defense
Initiative and seeks a Constitutional amendment against abortion.
It skewers the Democrats on ethics and promotes George Bush's
positions in favor of a child-care tax credit and increased
education spending.
   New Jersey Assembly Speaker Chuck Hardwick, a co-chair of the
panel, said, ``I think we have a platform here that's not only
concervative but it's compassionate. It's compassionate because
it's dealing with so many of the problems that are current in 1988
_ problems of the environment, of children, of health care, of
building for a better America.''
   Nebraksa Gov. Kay Orr, chairwoman of the Platform Committee,
missed her final committee session to attend a luncheon honoring
Nancy Reagan.
   The GOP platform is roughly eight times longer than the
5,200-word, streamlined document that the Democrats approved in
Atlanta last month.
   Rep. Jerry Lewis of California, a co-chairman, said the GOP
document was ``a substantive piece of work,'' unlike the Democrats'
``flight of fancy.''
   Kasten said afterwards, ``The Democrats gave us a little bit of
an opening. It's kind of unusual that they decided to be so vague
and almost kind of bragged about it. ... We have seen this as an
opportunity to become the party in which ideas have consequences.''
   ``This platform will be looked upon as a tool for George Bush
and Republican candidates to run upon,'' Kasten said.
   Weicker said he was against the platform both for ``what's in it
... (and) what's not in it.''
   He said the document fell short on civil rights, AIDS, social
justice and other issues, and ``we certainly don't do any favors
for women.''
   Weicker, the most liberal GOP senator, added, ``I'm against the
Democratic platform because it didn't say anything, and I'm against
the Republican platform because it says too much.''
   Boatwright, a GOP national committeewoman from Stonington,
Conn., stayed for the meeting despite an injury to her left leg
caused by an escalator mishap. She said she was riding up an
escalator at the Hilton Hotel ``and somebody dropped a whole bunch
of boxes. They got stuck at the top of the escalator. And I
couldn't get off so I fell over them.''
   She said the platform was ``a little bit more conservative than
our constituency in Connecticut feels.'' She delayed a trip to a
hospital for stitches because ``I certainly didn't want my senator
to vote alone.''
   Weicker, who lost attempts last Wednesday to liberalize the
platform's planks on abortion, AIDS and disability issues, said,
``It was a fair hearing. I took my licks and gave a few. That's the
whole process in this country. So, I'm not complaining, but neither
am I voting for it.''

<HEAD>US Deaths From AIDS Outnumber Those From Birth Defects</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs 4th graf, ``For statistical,'' to add figures for
overall category in which AIDS included</NOTE>

   AIDS claimed about 13,000 American lives last
year, a toll that would have ranked it 15th among all causes of
death, according to the first annual government statistical summary
to include the disease.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome was added to the annual
summary of disease starting in 1987, the National Center for Health
Statistics reported Monday.
   The agency estimated that between 12,450 and 13,820 Americans
died of AIDS last year. While AIDS was not officially added to the
overall rankings of causes of death, that total would have put in
15th place, ahead of birth defects, which claimed 12,130 lives.
   For statistical purposes, AIDS has been listed in the category
of ``other infectious and parasitic diseases,'' which accounted for
19,160 deaths in 1987, compared with 9,030 the year before.
   The report said 65 percent of AIDS victims were white males and
25 percent black males. White and black females each made up
between 4 percent and 5 percent of the total.
   The age groups most heaving affected were 25 to 34 and 35 to 44,
the study added.
   AIDS is a contagious, fatal disease that attacks the body's
immune system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases
and infections.
   The disease is spread most often through sexual contact, needles
or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood
products, and from infected pregnant women to their offspring.
   The chief victims of AIDS have been homosexual men and
intravenous drug abusers. Health officials estimate that
heterosexual contact is responsible for 4 percent of cases and that
between 1 million and 1.5 million Americans have been exposed to
the virus.
   A person who tests positive for antibodies to the AIDS virus, an
indication of exposure, has a 20 percent to 30 percent chance of
developing AIDS over a five-year period, according to the federal
Centers for Disease Control.
   As of Aug. 8, AIDS had been diagnosed in 70,208 Americans, of
whom more than half, or 39,620, have died since June 1, 1981,
according to the federal Centers for Disease Control. No one is
known to have recovered from AIDS.

   Republican convention organizers say time
pressures brought on by the mystery over George Bush's running mate
are forcing them to begin writing ``generic'' speeches for
last-minute use by the person picked for the ticket.
   They conceded, however, that they'd leave some room for
modification to fit whoever delivers the speech.
   ``By Wednesday morning...we will have one or two writers working
on a generic kind of acceptance speech which the nominee would then
have to take and modify and put into his or her own style of
words,'' said Fred Malek, George Bush's convention manager.
   By keeping the vice presidential selection the best-kept secret
in the convention city, Bush adds pressure to organizers of the
convention who are working hard to orchestrate even the tiniest
detail for a good television showing.
   That includes editing and painstaking revision of every word in
every speech delivered from the podium. Malek said those
speechwriters want an early start on the vice presidential
nominee's speech, because it will be a major focus of the
convention's final night.
   ``It's a generic kind of a speech, it's a draft,'' Malek said.
``The nominee will not learn of his or her selection until Thursday
morning.''
   Even with the head-start on the nominating speech, Malek said
convention organizers will face a last-minute scramble to line up
nominating speakers _ and write their speeches.
   ``We've got two other, three other addresses, really, to go
along with it,'' Malek said. ``They will be also in the same
sequence. We'll have one or two writers working on an acceptance
speech and another working on a nominating speech.
   ``We won't start this until Wednesday,'' he said. ``They will
have no clues, nor will I, on who it's going to be.
   ``A good writer, with some general directions and general clues,
can get a running start,'' Malek said.
   ``We haven't selected yet who is going to give the nominating
speeches, for the same reason,'' he said. ``We are developing some
ideas of who are good speakers and could do it.''
   Part of the problem, Malek said, is whoever nominates the vice
presidential candidate must have some logical ties to the person
selected and fit within the campaign theme selected by Bush.
   ``There's got to be some kind of a linkage,'' he said.
   This week's Republican National Convention is a carefully
scripted affair, and Malek clearly wasn't comfortable with leaving
major gaps in a schedule that's been developed over months of
planning.
   ``We don't have any choice,'' Malek said.
   ``I think it's going to be all right, I think we have the
caliber of people to do the nomination. I don't have any great
trepidations about that. Obviously they could do a better job with
more time.''

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Severe thunderstorms broke out Monday over parts of the
Northeast and the Ohio Valley, with widespread rain over the
Southeast, and temperatures reached record highs from Iowa to the
East Coast.
   Intense thunderstorms moved over sections of Ohio during the
morning with high wind and heavy rainfall. Wind downed trees and
power lines in Defiance County, and nearly an inch of rain fell in
less than an hour in northern Ashland County. One person survived a
lightning strike near Albion, the National Weather Service said.
   Severe thunderstorms also developed in warm, moist air ahead of
a cold front over sections of the Northeast. Wind uprooted trees at
Johnsonville, N.Y., and downed numerous trees at Keene and Jaffrey,
N.H.
   ``We had alarms going off, flooding in the streets, power lines
going down, trees going down. What else can I tell you,'' said
officer Terry Talomadge in Jaffrey. ``The rain was so thick you
couldn't see your hand in front of your face.''
   Power was out in some parts of New Hampshire and some streets
were flooded.
   A strong thunderstorm spawned a tornado near Greensburg, Pa.,
during the afternoon.
   Other showers and thunderstorms were along the Gulf Coast, over
New Mexico and the Texas Panhandle, Florida, the southern Atlantic
Coast states and the Tennessee Valley. Homestead Air Force Base,
Fla., got 3.04 inches of rain in the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT.
   Philadelphia again broke a record for greatest number of
90-degree or higher days in a year, reaching its 48th day at that
heat. It was also the 18th consecutive day of temperatures 90 or
above.
   Williamsport, Pa., hit a record 40 days of 90 degrees or higher.
   Record highs Monday included 97 at Allentown, Pa.; 99 at
Atlantic City, N.J.; 101 in downtown Baltimore and 98 at the
airport; 99 at Charleston, W.Va.; 102 at Des Moines, Iowa; 97 at
Hartford, Conn.; 96 at Indianapolis; 97 at Louisville, Ky.; 97 at
New York City; 102 at Peoria, Ill.; 98 at Philadelphia; 97 at
Rockford, Ill.; 99 at Washington's National Airport; and 97 at
Wilmington, Del.
   Records were tied at Cape Hatteras, N.C., at 89; at Evansville,
Ind., at 98; and at Williamsport, Pa., at 97.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 56
degrees at Arcata, Calif., to 112 at Pierre, S.D. The nation's low
Monday morning was 30 degrees at Truckee, Calif.
   For Tuesday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
over the Gulf Coast and Florida, the coast of North Carolina,
northern Maine, northwestern Montana, central Arizona and along the
front range of the Rockies. Scattered showers and thunderstorms
also were forecast ahead of a cold front over eastern sections of
the northern Plains and the upper Mississippi Valley.
   Highs in the 60s and 70s were predicted in the Pacific Northwest
and the California coast; in the 70s in northern New England;
between 100 and 105 in northern Texas, the middle and northern
Plains, and the middle Mississippi Valley; between 100 and 110 in
the desert Southwest and the Rio Grande valley; and in the 80s and
90s across most of the rest of the nation.

<HEAD>Special Session To Levy $74 Million For Gulf Cease-fire Group</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The General Assembly wants to levy $74
million from members to finance the military observers who will
monitor the cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war beginning Aug. 20,
officials said Monday.
   The world body, which is in a financial crisis, gave details of
the peacekeeping program for the first time in a published report
Monday. It said more than 1,300 personnel will monitor the
cease-fire and troop withdrawal in the 8-year-old conflict.
   The 159-member assembly scheduled emergency sessions Tuesday and
Wednesday to arrange six-month financing for the operation.
   The report said about 350 of the U.N. monitoring team will be
unarmed military observers. An additional 615 will be military
personnel, including 80 military police, 375 signal-communications
personnel, 130 helicopter crew and maintenance personnel and 30
sailors. Another 350 will be civilian staff.
   The U.N. Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group, its official name,
was created last Tuesday by the Security Council after
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar announced that both sides
agreed to observe a cease-fire starting Aug. 20. The belligerents
will begin direct talks under U.N. auspices in Geneva on Aug. 25.
   About $47 million of the $74 million to be assessed is for
start-up expenses. The 24-nation force could be extended after six
months.
   Preparations also are under way to put together the first U.N.
naval force, which will patrol the disputed Shatt al-Arab waterway
and other sensitive areas.
   The United States, whose fees add up to a fourth of the U.N.
budget, is expected to be assessed about $23 million of the total
cost for the peacekeeping force. U.S. officials said Washington
wants Arab nations and Japan to donate extra money to the force,
since they are wealthy and benefit from the war's end.
   The United Nations is in its worst financial crisis because of
arrears by its members, especially the United States. Washington
owes $467 million of $602 million in unpaid dues to the regular
budget. It also owes $70 million in back dues for peacekeeping
forces.
   The United States, which promoted U.N. negotiations to end the
Iran-Iraq war, has been withholding dues in an effort to compel the
organization to institute budgetary reforms, cut personnel and
improve efficiency.
   U.N. officials said the organization faces insolvency next month
if money is not forthcoming. About $44 million in U.S. funds has
been approved by Congress for this year but not yet released.
   The nations contributing officers to monitor the cease-fire are
Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Canada, Denmark,
Finland, Ghana, Hungary, Indonesia, India, Ireland, Italy, Kenya,
Malaysia, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Poland, Senegal, Sweden,
Turkey, Yugoslavia and Zambia.
   Canada is contributing a large signal corps.
   The U.N. force will require a large civilian contingent,
including about 180 U.N. international staff and 160 local recruits.
   An advance group already is in the region and more soldiers will
arrive this week.
   A report submitted Monday by the secretary-general said the
levies from member nations would be paid into a special account to
finance the force from Aug. 9 to next Feb. 8.
   Joint headquarters will be at both Baghdad and Tehran. Gen.
Slavko Jovic of Yugoslavia, head of Military Observer Group, will
shuttle between the capitals. Detachment headquarters will be at
Baghdad and Bakhtaran, Iran.
   Sector headquarters in Iran will be at forward locations at
Saqqez, Bakhtaran, Dezful and Ahvaz and in Iraq at Kirkut, Ba-Qubah
and Basra.
   The U.N. report also calls for renting three 10-seat aircraft,
one 50-seat plane, 12 helicopters and two patrol vessels.
   Rental of airplanes is estimated at $2.5 million, helicopters at
$9.36 million and patrol boats at $1.38 million for six months.
   The group will purchase at least 13 categories of vehicles, from
jeep-type vehicles to forklift trucks, for $6 million and will buy
communications equipment for $5.57 million.
   Nations which contribute soldiers will pay their salaries, but
the United Nations will pay for daily allowances and other costs.
   Cost of gasoline and oil is estimated at about $950,000, office
furniture at $500,000, teleprinter equipment $78,000, medical
treatment and evacuation of personnel $50,000, subscriptions to
newspapers and periodicals $30,000, death and disability awards
$400,000, uniform clothing, $300,000.

<HEAD>Gandhi Warns Pakistan Against Helping Sikhs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAJU GOPALAKRISHNAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi warned
Pakistan on Monday against aiding Sikh insurgents in Punjab state,
saying he did not want to take further action Pakistan ``might
later regret.''
   He spoke at celebrations of the 41st anniversary of India's
independence from Britain. Clashes in Kashmir state related to the
celebrations injured at least 75 people, including 25 police
officers, the Press Trust of India said.
   In Gujarat state, Popatlal Sarothia, a legislator of Gandhi's
governing Congress Party, was shot and killed Monday by a
disgruntled party worker attending independence festivites, the
news agency said.
   Gandhi said at a ceremony in New Delhi, ``We have taken firm
action against (Sikh) terrorism.'' He did not elaborate.
   He has often accused Pakistan of arming and training Sikh rebels
who are fighting for a separate homeland in northern Punjab state,
which borders Pakistan. India has offered no proof and Pakistan has
denied the charge.
   ``We do not wish to take action (Pakistan) might later regret,''
the prime minister said. He did not refer to Pakistan by name, but
said Sikh insurgents were getting help from across the border.
   On Sunday, Indian border guards shot and killed 11 Pakistanis as
they tried to slip across the border into Kashmir, authorities said.
   Sikh radicals have waged a bloody six-year struggle in Punjab,
which has claimed about 1,700 lives this year.
   In Srinagar, capital of Kashmir state adjoining Pakistan, police
fired in the air to disperse pro-Pakistani demonstrators objecting
to independence celebrations, PTI reported. It said demonstrators
burned a police jeep, threw stones at police and forced shops to
close, with at least 75 people hurt.
   Pakistan was part of India until 1947. Since their joint
independence from Britain, the two nations have fought each other
in three wars.
   Pakistan controls 30 percent of Kashmir, but claims the entire
state as its own. India rejects the claim.
   At least 2,500 security officers were on duty as Gandhi
delivered his Independence Day address at the 16th-century Red Fort
in New Delhi, according to a police official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Guests, including Cabinet ministers and foreign diplomats, were
frisked before the 40-minute ceremony and sharpshooters were posted
on tall buildings around the sandstone fort.
   Gandhi, wearing white trousers and a tunic, unfurled the Indian
flag on the ramparts of the fort to begin the festivities.
   He referred in his speech to the nearby island nation of Sri
Lanka, where about 47,000 Indian soldiers are deployed to enforce a
July 29, 1987, peace accord aimed at ending a five-year rebellion
by Tamil insurgents.
   Tamil rebels returned to combat after a brief truce and are
fighting Indian troops.
   ``We hope that the accord will be speedily implemented,'' Gandhi
said.
   A major reason for India's brokering the accord was that India
has 60 million Tamils of its own, who are sympathetic to the Sri
Lankan rebel cause. Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16
million people and claim discrimination by the majority Sinhalese
population.
   India's diplomatic mission in Colombo, Sri Lanka, is under heavy
security after intelligence reports that a Tamil assassination
squad entered the capital.

   Onetime presidential candidate Pete du Pont
called on Jesse Jackson to become a Republican, saying Monday that
he has no political future as a Democrat.
   ``May I suggest with all sincerity that the ground you seek is
here, in New Orleans, in the party of Lincoln and Reagan and Bush
and Kemp and Bork,'' du Pont said in an address to the Republican
National Convention.
   Delegates applauded as du Pont listed reasons he believed the
Republican Party was superior to the Democratic Party.
   But when he said of Jackson, ``We ask you to join us because we
need you and you need us,'' the Superdome was silent.
   Jackson wasn't talking about it either; Pam Smith, a spokeswoman
for him in Chicago, said he would have no comment.
   ``Rev. Jackson, you seek common ground, higher ground,'' du Pont
said to the convention.
   Du Pont praised Jackson for expressing the ``most interesting
thoughts'' at the Democratic National Convention last month in
Atlanta. However, du Pont did not mention any specifics.
   ``As long as your lungs have breath, yours will be a prominent
voice,'' du Pont said. ``But as long as you speak as a Democrat,
you will never be a successful leader.''
   The GOP has formed committees to recruit blacks and other
minorities to become Republicans, but the party remains
predominantly white. An Associated Press survey found that 92
percent of the delegates to the national convention are white.
   Du Pont mentioned the name of George Bush just twice.
   Using Jackson's keep-hope-alive slogan, he said Bush ``will not
only keep hope alive, but he will make the dream of millions of
Americans come true.''
   Du Pont, a former governor of Delaware and an heir to the
family's chemical empire, entered the GOP presidential race on
Sept. 16, 1986, and dropped out last Feb. 18, two days after the
New Hampshire primary.

<HEAD>Researcher Probes Using Hypnosis To Fight AIDS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL VERSCHUUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American researcher said Monday
she is investigating whether hypnosis can help people with AIDS
strengthen their immune systems, which the virus that produces the
deadly disease destroys.
   Karen Olness, professor of pediatrics at the Case Western
Reserve University in Cleveland, said she is ``very optimistic''
that hypnosis eventually may play a role in battling acquired
immune deficiency syndrome.
   AIDS undermines the body's disease-fighting immune system,
rendering it vulnerable to various infections and forms of cancer.
Ms. Olness said she is trying to find out whether some infections
can be prevented or slowed.
   Hypnosis has been found effective in the treatment of less
serious immune-related illnesses, such as warts, Ms. Olness told
The Associated Press in an interview.
   She was attending the 11th International Congress on Hypnosis
and Psychosomatic Medicine, a gathering of more than 600 medical
and psychiatric experts.
   ``We are trying to find out which immune changes a human being
can voluntarily affect'' under the influence of hypnosis, she said.
   Ms. Olness added that she had recently began an experiment
involving about 50 hemophiliac children infected with the humane
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS. Hemophiliacs are
a major risk group for AIDS, which they contract through infected
blood transfusions.
   Part of the group is being taught self-hypnosis techniques to
see if they develop more antibodies against disease than the other
children, Ms. Olness said.
   The patients, all aged 5 to 12, are shown a puppet show that
explains the basics of the immune system.
   They then are hypnotized and given the suggestion that they can
voluntarily increase production of certain antibodies, shesaid, and
in later stages of the experiment they should be able to invoke the
hypnotic state themselves.
   Her experiment's purpose is to boost boosting the function of
T-cell lymphocytes, immune system cells that can help fight off
AIDS infection.
   Mrs. Olness said her work was in line with a recent experiment
in which a group of children showed significant increases of
immunoglobulins _ immune system proteins _ in their saliva after
undergoing hypnotic treatment.
   ``They were effectively increasing their antibodies'' just by
being told to do so under hypnosis, she said. The experiment
involved was conducted two years ago at the University of Minnesota
in Minneapolis, Minn., according to Ms. Olness.
   A hypnotized person is made to concentrate on a particular image
and enters an altered state of consciousness similiar to sleep.
While that condition lasts, the patient is highly susceptible to
suggestions that would otherwise seem strange or unacceptable.
   Conversely, the immune system can be severely weakened by
adverse factors such as stress, Ms. Olness said, adding that little
is known about the exact relationship between a person's emotional
state and the body's resistance to disease.
   She acknowledged that the experiment, scheduled to last for two
years, may be too short for lasting conclusions. Not all HIV
carriers ultimately develop AIDS, and it may take several years for
symptoms to appear in those who do.
   Use of hypnosis in fighting immune-related disease is among the
most recent applications of the practice, which became popular in
the late 18th century through the work of the Austrian physician
Franz Mesmer.
   AIDS is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products
and from pregnant women to their offspring.

   An explosion at a shopping
plaza in a white suburb of Durban slightly injured a woman Monday
and damaged a bakery, police said.
   A 19-year-old woman employee suffered minor cuts when the blast
shattered windows at the shop in the Glenashley section of the
Indian Ocean port city, police said.
   Police said they had not determined the cause of the explosion,
which occurred just after 7 p.m.
   About 100 bombings have been reported in South Africa since the
government declared a nationwide emergency June 12, 1986.
   Authorities have blamed virtually all the bombs on the African
National Congress, the main black group fighting white domination
in South Africa.
   The guerrilla group, based in Lusaka, Zambia, seldom confirms or
denies involvement in such attacks.

   A high-ranking Soviet diplomat arrived
at the secret Nevada Test Site on Monday as the countdown continued
to Wednesday's historic joint U.S.-Soviet nuclear weapons test.
   Igor M. Palenykh, who headed the Soviet delegation during the
arms control talks in Geneva, was taken to the remote desert site
65 miles from Las Vegas, where final preparations are under way for
a test that will mark a milestone in the atomic age.
   Palenykh's arrival was not announced in advance.
   The nuclear test, known officially as the Joint Verification
Experiment, comes nearly four years after President Reagan first
proposed such a project in a speech to the United Nations. It is
designed to measure each country's ability to monitor the size of
the other's test. Verification could lead to ratification of
treaties limiting the size of nuclear tests, which were signed in
1974 and 1976 but never ratified.
   Scientists from the United States and the Soviet Union will be
measuring the explosive punch of a thermonuclear device encased in
a steel canister buried 2,050 feet beneath a picturesque mesa.
   The canister, painted red, white and blue, is 8 feet tall, 88
inches in diameter, and weighs 7{ tons. Soviet scientists were
allowed to look at the canister, but only after the nuclear device
had been sealed inside.
   While the test will measure the size of a blast, it is not
directly related to a possible test ban. However, scientists and
diplomats say Wednesday's experiment is a crucial first step.
   Energy Department spokesman Chris West said Palenykh's
counterpart at the Geneva talks, U.S. Ambassador C. Paul Robinson,
is scheduled to arrive at the test site this week.
   ``The weather looks good and from a technical standpoint,
everything's in place,'' West said Monday afternoon. ``We're just
making last minute checks and double-checks. Both sides want to
make sure it goes like clockwork.''
   Robinson, who helped forge the historic agreement, called the
test unprecedented and said it was the result of a ``breakthrough
in negotiations'' between the United States and the Soviet Union.
   The test will mark the first time nuclear scientists from either
country have been allowed on the other's highly sensitive test
sites. As many as 45 Soviets will be on the secret Nevada Test Site
to monitor Wednesday's blast, scheduled for 1 p.m. EDT.
   A like number of U.S. scientists, who conduct nuclear testing
programs for the U.S. and Great Britain, will be on hand for a
Soviet test at Semipalatinsk sometime next month.
   On Wednesday, the two superpowers will be testing their own
monitoring systems. The United States will be using a system known
as CORRTEX _ continuous reflectometry for radius versus time
experiment _ which determines the yield of a nuclear explosion by
measuring the shock waves from the blast.
   The Soviets will be testing similar systems to see if they
obtain the same data. The data for both sides will be recorded in
trailers hundreds of yards from the blast site. No one will be
allowed with 15 miles, except for helicopters monitoring the site
with television cameras.
   Soviet and American scientists, along with selected reporters,
will monitor the blast from a control point 30 miles away.
   Systems to measure the size of an explosion are considered a key
in ratifying the 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty and the 1976
Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty. Both limit nuclear tests to 150
kilotons and both sides have accused the other of exceeding those
limits.
   The Soviet scientists are based at Mercury, a tiny community on
the remote desert test site. They are allowed to move around at
will in Mercury, but are taken under escort to all other areas of
the secret site.

<HEAD>Thatcher Says Britain Will Crack Down On IRA Funding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Monday her
government will enact laws prohibiting banks from handling funds of
the Irish Republican Army and other terrorist groups.
   It will be illegal for banks and other financial institutions,
accountants and financial advisers to handle such funds and the
government will be empowered to seize the assets of convicted
terrorists, she said.
   Mrs. Thatcher also said her government plans to put a special
force in Northern Ireland to combat extortion and fund-raising
rackets run by the IRA, a predominantly Roman Catholic group trying
to drive Britain from the province, and rival Protestant
organizations.
   She outlined her plans in a letter to the Rev. Martin Smyth, a
lawmaker from Northern Ireland's largest Protestant party, the
Official Unionists, who had accused the government of inadequate
efforts against the IRA and other outlawed organizations.
   The Irish Republic passed legislation in 1985 enabling the
government to seize money suspected of belonging to the IRA, which
also is outlawed in the republic.
   Convention obliges Mrs. Thatcher to withhold details of planned
legislation until Queen Elizabeth II presents the government's
program at the opening of Parliament in November.
   A spokesman for Sinn Fein, the IRA's legal political wing, said
eliminating the distinctive car license plates issued to British
soldiers serving in West Germany will not protect them from
guerrilla attacks.
   Sean MacManus, Sinn Fein's national chairman, said in a
statement the proposal was only a ``cosmetic exercise.''
   Calls for a change in the distinctive license plates were
renewed after the IRA killed a British soldier driving in Belgium
on Friday.
   ``Changing British soldiers' car license plates won't protect
them from Irish Republican Army attacks while their army continues
to occupy part of Ireland's national territory,'' MacManus said.
   Warrant Officer 1st Class Richard Michael Heakin, based in
Moenchen Bladbach, West Germany, was shot by two men who approached
his car while it was stopped at a traffic light in Ostend, Belgium.
   West Germany gives special tax concessions to 90,000 private
vehicles owned by British military personnel based there but the
vehicles must be clearly distinguished. The concessions include
duty-free gas and the right to buy car insurance in Britain, where
rates are cheaper.

   Iraq accused Iran on Monday of bombarding
its troops with artillery and mortar fire, the second time in a
week it said Tehran had broken a promise not to attack in the days
leading to a formal cease-fire.
   Iraq made its accusations in a letter from the Iraqi mission to
the United Nations. It did not mention casualties or damage.
   Iran denied a similar accusation last week. Iraqi Ambassador
Ismat T. Kittani did not lodge a protest, but filed a brief
``factual report'' with the United Nations.
   In the latest letter, Iraq said Iranian gunners fired from
Saturday through Monday in army sectors that include the Iraqi
southern port city of Basra and the southern Faw Peninsula.
   On Aug. 8, Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar announced
that Iran and Iraq had agreed to a truce in their nearly 8-year-old
war beginning Saturday, and to start peace talks five days later in
Geneva.
   Iran gave Perez de Cuellar a letter pledging not to engage in
military action except in self-defense. Iraq did not offer such a
letter, but the secretary-general said both countries told him they
would restrain their armed forces.
   Last week, Tehran lodged a protest with the U.N. chief, claiming
Iraqi warplanes violated Iran's air space and created sonic booms
over five cities.

<HEAD>Tracing Sexual, Drug Partners of AIDS-Infected People Called
Premature</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>

   Health officials are premature in embracing
programs to trace sexual and needle-sharing partners of people
infected with the AIDS virus, researchers said Monday.
   Such programs are required by the federal government as a
condition of grants to states for AIDS programs.
   But there is little evidence such programs curb the spread of
the virus, the researchers said at the annual meeting of the
American Psychological Association.
   In response, a government public health expert defended the
programs as a way to get education to people a high risk of
infection.
   ``We have to try and make education work,'' said Russ Havlak of
the federal Centers for Disease Control.
   The virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome can be
spread by sex or sharing of needles used to inject drugs. One goal
of notification is to limit the spread of infection, by uncovering
people who do not realize they carry the virus and persuading them
to act accordingly.
   But evidence is lacking that notification affects virus spread,
said Edmund Dejowski of Rutgers University. So it is premature to
adopt widespread notification, he said.
   CDC's Havlak said that while the brief counseling that surrounds
a notification will not be enough to make a person change his
behavior, that counseling is ``only the beginning.''
   Long-term counseling and support are needed to bring about
behavior change, he said. Many parts of the country have yet to
develop such programs, he added.
   Dejowski also said the workings of some notification programs
raise questions about the rights of notified people.
   One city's notifiers ask to draw blood for a test from the
person at the time he is notified, he said. The contacted person,
having just heard ``overwhelming'' information from a stranger, may
not be able to properly consider that request, Dejowski said.
   Havlak called the point arguable, but said the notifiers offer
on-the-spot testing only as an option. Distraught people are
offered crisis intervention help rather than being forced to decide
on the blood test, he said.
   Dejowski also criticized pending federal legislation that would
make states and local governments allow notification of spouses to
be done by medical personnel. Such notification lacks the control
and accountability of programs by public agencies, he said.
   And there is no guarantee that a doctor, nurse or other medical
professional would have the training and sensitivity to deliver the
news properly, he said.
   Havlak said he knows of no state that now prevents doctors from
doing such notifications. Doctors can get help from state health
departments if they wish, he said.

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo said
Monday the Sandinista government and U.S.-supported rebels are
preparing for more war after several failed attempts at talking
peace.
   During the news program El Pensamiento on privately owned Radio
Noticias, the Roman Catholic prelate referred to a broadcast in
which a leader of the rebels, known as Contras, said they never
will abandon their fight against the leftist Sandinistas.
   ``I heard a few moments ago something resembling the Roman
saying that `if you want peace, prepare for war,' and it seems both
sides are preparing for war,'' Obando y Bravo, archbishop of
Managua, said. ``That would be deplorable because those who pay the
price for it are the youths who are dying.
   ``I have always said dialogue should be the solution, but it
seems clear a propitious climate for dialogue doesn't exist at this
moment.
   ``God willing the government and the (Contra) resistance will
adopt flexible positions. These inflexible positions only produce
death, destruction and the country's ruin,'' he said.
   Contras and their civilian supporters have been fleeing to
neighboring Honduras as supplies dwindle for lack of U.S. funds,
but rebel leader Enrique Bermudez said on clandestine Liberation
Radio the fight will continue.
   ``If we want peace, we should prepare ourselves for war,''
Bermudez said at a ceremony inducting 600 new guerrillas into
Contra ranks at a camp in southern Honduras. Liberation Radio
carried parts of the ceremony.
   ``We will not abandon the struggle until we achieve democracy in
Nicaragua,'' Bermudez said. ``We will lay down our weapons only in
exchange for democracy ... (otherwise) the Nicaraguan people will
declare us guilty of writing one of the blackest chapters in our
country's history.''
   ``We will not return to the negotiating table until the
Sandinistas are ready to talk seriously,'' he said, referring to
President Daniel Ortega's call last week for resumption of the
stalled peace talks.
   Bermudez, a hard liner, was elected last month to the
seven-member directorate of the Contra umbrella organization
Nicaraguan Resistance.
   Contra and Sandinista representatives signed a cease-fire
agreement March 23 that has been extended but often violated.
Ortega last extended it unilaterally for 30 days until Aug. 31.
   Efforts to negotiate a permanent truce have been deadlocked. The
Contras insist the Sandinistas introduce democratic reforms before
they lay down their arms, but the Sandinistas demand the rebels
stop fighting and join the legal opposition.
   Contra negotiators broke off the last meeting in Managua, saying
the government confined them to their hotel and did not allow them
to meet with opposition leaders.
   Ortega proposed another meeting Aug. 27-29 in Managua or
Washington.
   The Contras demanded a site elsewhere in Central America,
preferably San Jose, Costa Rica, and that Ortega lead the
government delegation. The Sandinistas have not responded.
   Last week, Honduras revived the issue of an international
verification commission provided for in a Central American peace
plan of Aug. 7, 1987, and said it should operate on the
Nicaragua-Honduras border to keep Contras and Sandinista troops
apart.
   Ortega agreed, but on Monday the rebels objected.
   Contra leader Adolfo Calero said in Miami: ``The Nicaraguan
Resistance is present throughout Nicaragua ... so if you are going
to get an international force to guarantee a security zone, it will
be necessary to have an international force that will guarantee all
of Nicaragua as a security zone.''

   The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is
likely to concur with the minor disciplinary recommendations
contained in an investigative report on the shootdown of an Iranian
airliner by the USS Vincennes, defense officials said Monday.
   The report, in its current form, recommends the light penalty of
a ``non-punitive letter of censure'' for the guided-missile
cruiser's operations officer, said the officials, who insisted on
anonymity.
   That officer, so far not identified, would be reprimanded for
his role in misinterpreting radar data and leading the Vincennes'
skipper, Capt. Will C. Rogers, to believe that the ship was about
to be attacked by an Iranian fighter.
   Rogers and other crew members would not face any disciplinary
action, even though investigators concluded the Iranian airliner
was shot down primarily through human error aboard the ship, the
sources said. All 290 people aboard the Iran Air A-300 Airbus died
in the July 3 incident.
   Adm. William J. Crowe, the chairman of the joint chiefs,
received the investigative report a week ago and will forward the
document to Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci soon, the sources
said.
   Crowe has the prerogative of changing the report's
recommendations before they are presented to Carlucci, ``but that
doesn't look like it's going to happen,'' said one official.
   ``It's hard, because 290 people died. But the Vincennes was on a
wartime footing and just coming out of combat when this happened.
No system is perfect in war,'' the official said.
   Carlucci, as the final reviewing authority, may accept or reject
Crowe's findings.
   The recommendation that only one officer be disciplined in the
incident was first reported Sunday by The Washington Post, which
said the operations officer faced a letter of reprimand.
   However, defense officials said Monday that the recommendation
involved a non-punitive letter of censure, which is a lighter
penalty than a letter of reprimand because it won't become an
official part of the officer's service record.
   The sources also said the special board of inquiry that
investigated the incident had not originally recommended any
disciplinary action at all.
   The recommendation for a letter of censure was inserted by Gen.
George B. Crist, the head of the U.S. Central Command, before he
forwarded the report to Crowe, the sources said.
   Two weeks ago, defense officials disclosed the board of inquiry
_ headed by Rear Adm. William N. Fogarty _ had concluded the
Vincennes attacked and destroyed the Airbus because of human
mistakes made under the stress of combat.
   Because of the mistakes, Capt. Rogers believed his ship had
survived its first combat action with Iranian gunboats only to
confront an approaching, ``hostile'' Iranian F-14 jet fighter, the
sources said.
   There was no evidence the Aegis radar system aboard the cruiser
malfunctioned or that it presented technical data to justify the
``hostile'' classification, the sources added.

<TEXT>
   A Soviet historian says the goals of the
Czechoslovak reforms Soviet tanks crushed 20 years ago were similar
to those now pursued by Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   L.S. Yagodovsky's article in the latest issue of the weekly
journal Arguments and Facts contrasted dramatically with previous
characterizations of the the ``Prague spring'' led by Alexander
Dubcek, which ended with a Soviet-led invasion Aug. 21, 1968.
   As recently as January, the Soviet news agency Tass said
comparisons with current Soviet reforms were the work of Western
propaganda.
   Yagodovsky, assistant director of the Soviet Academy of
Sciences' Institute of the Economy of the World Socialist System,
used such Gorbachev words as ``restructuring,'' ``glasnost,''
``self-management,'' and ``self-financing'' to describe the
Czechoslovak reforms.
   Reforms adopted by the Czechoslovak Communist Party in 1965
``coincide with the basic principles of today's transformation in
this area in Czechoslovakia, as with the conception of economic
reform existing at this time in the Soviet Union and other
socialist countries,'' he said in the Aug. 13-19 edition of the
journal.
   He said Leonid I. Brezhnev, then the Soviet leader, was more
sympathethic to conservative opponents, and in the end reformers
let the situation get out of control.
   Yagodovsky quoted party documents that said no way existed to
restore order in the country except to invite the invasion.
   He said conservatives backed by party chief Antonin Novotny
blocked the reforms and they could not succeed without
``perestroika of the form and methods of party work, without
democratization of society, affirmation of glasnost (openness),
without giving socialism genuine human lines.''
   Dubcek replaced Novotny as party leader in January 1968, and in
March Ludvik Svoboda replaced Novotny as president.
   Further reforms put in place in January and April 1968 ``opened
the way for normalization of the situation, uniting the leading
forces in a platform of renewal,'' Yagodovsky said, but Dubcek and
other party leaders did not take advantage of it.
   ``One of the main reasons, in my view, is that despite the
rearrangement in the government, unity in the Presidium of the
Czechoslovak Communist Party, and in the party as a whole, was not
guaranteed,'' he said.
   All top officials wanted reforms but did not agree on what the
reforms meant, he said.
   ``Anti-socialist forces'' inside and outside Czechoslovakia
became more active and the situation in the country deteriorated
sharply, he said. Yagodovsky quoted Czechoslovak party documents as
saying the party was paralyzed, the government on the brink of
decay and there was no choice but to bring in the Warsaw Pact force
to restore order.
   Dubcek was replaced as Czechoslovak party leader in April 1969
by Gustav Husak, who retired last year after running one of the
Soviet bloc's more conservative organizations for nearly a
generation.

   Harold Stassen wound down his eighth
fruitless presidential campaign Monday with the claim that ``I've
always had something to say'' during his 40-year quest for the
White House.
   ``The fascinating thing about this year,'' the 81-year-old
Stassen said in an interview as the Republican National Convention
began here, ``is I came in very late saying (that) none of the
other 14 candidates were saying anything about children.
   ``I said we needed a new American children's program, we needed
it urgently. So, I'm quite fascinated that they're all talking
about a new children's program now, the candidates of both
parties.''
   Stassen, the one-time ``Boy Wonder'' of Minnesota politics, was
elected governor at age 31, and re-elected in 1940 and '42. He
resigned in 1943 to serve in the Navy during World War II, and
never won another election.
   Stassen was a major contender for the GOP presidential
nomination in 1948, when the party's nod went to Thomas Dewey.
   He also unsuccessfully opposed Barry Goldwater for the party's
nomination in 1964, Richard Nixon in 1968, Gerald Ford in 1976 and
Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984.
   Stassen entered primaries this year in New Hampshire, West
Virginia and a few other states.
   He insisted that campaigning, even when there is no chance of
victory, is the best way to get a hearing for his views.
   ``You don't get attention to your views'' by writing letters or
talking to politicians, said Stassen, who practices law and lives
with his wife, Esther, in the St. Paul suburb of Sunfish Lake.
   Stassen said he's attended about a dozen Republican National
Conventions, the first in 1936 as president of a young Republicans
organization.
   Asked whether he will run for president again, Stassen said, ``I
don't know how long I'm going to live.''

<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An experimental Roman Catholic parish
that offered extensive lay participation such as planning the
liturgy went out of official existence Monday, but its members
vowed to carry on.
   Daniel Corley, a lay trustee of the Genesis Community, said the
13-year-old group would continue in some form despite Bishop Louis
E. Gelineau's decision to disband it as a formal church-sanctioned
group.
   ``After today, the bishop has told us that we cannot have a
priest and a Eucharist celebrated on Sunday morning,'' Corley said.
``We will be following the bishop's directive over the next 40
days. We will not get together as a community for Eucharist
celebration on Sunday morning.''
   The group will meet on Sunday nights for ``prayer, reflection
and discussion'' and will decide at the end of the 40 days where to
proceed, Corley said.
   Last month, Gelineau, who created the Genesis Community 13 years
ago, announced it would be dissolved after a task force he
commissioned found it beset with ``erroneous attitudes'' concerning
church teaching.
   Corley said the group was consulting canon lawyers to see
whether Gelineau's decision could be appealed. William G. Halpin,
spokesman for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence, said he did
not think an appeal was possible.
   ``They're an experimental open worship community that was a
creation of the diocese, so it's strictly a diocesan internal
matter,'' Halpin said.
   ``My understanding is that their only appeal would be to the
bishop,'' he said. ``I don't think there's any provision where they
could go over his head _ to Rome, for example.''
   The Genesis Community, unlike most Catholic parishes, was open
to Rhode Islanders regardless of where in the state they lived.
Corley said it was distinguished by the role lay people played in
``sitting down with the priest, planning liturgy, social justice
concerns.''
   Conflicts between the group and its most recent priest, the Rev.
Peter Scagnelli, led Gelineau to commission the task force that
recommended ending the experiment.
   Corley said the conflicts included whether leavened or
unleavened bread would be used during the Eucharist ceremony and
whether lay people as well as priests could read from the Gospel or
deliver homilies.
   He said the community gave in to Scagnelli on each of those
issues, but with each concession, some members became more and more
disturbed.
   Some members said the degree of lay participation was what drew
them to Genesis and warned that the church's resistance to the idea
would be self-defeating.
   ``The Catholic Church is not the cathedral. It's not the clergy.
It's us. It's the people,'' said member Jack Cotter. ``I can't see
myself going back to the parish I left 13 years ago.''

<HEAD>Democratic Ticket Supports Manned Space Station</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen used a
visit to the Johnson Space Flight Center Monday to announce the
Democratic ticket will support building a permanent manned space
station.
   The Texas senator, long a supporter of the space program, said
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis now endorses the permanent
station, and ``that nails it down.''
   Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, issued his endorsement in
Shrewsbury, Mass., and said he would pay for the station by cutting
some weapons programs and requiring tighter Defense Department
management.
   A Dukakis-Bentsen administration `` will support an all-out
effort to restore American leadership in exploring the universe,''
Bentsen said in a speech to the Houston Chamber of Commerce.
   Although President Reagan is a long-time supporter of the space
station, Bentsen said the administration has mismanaged the space
effort. If Dukakis is elected president, Bentsen said, he as vice
president would be put in charge of a reconstituted Cabinet-level
space council.
   Lyndon Johnson headed the space council when he was vice
president. But the board was later abolished by President Nixon,
and Reagan has killed recent efforts in Congress to put it back in
operation, Bentsen said.
   Dukakis's previous silence on the question of the space station
has created worries in states with large National Aeronautics and
Space Administration installations, including Texas. Although
Congress has authorized $902 million for starting the project next
year, the next president will have the option of withholding $515
million of that, NASA officials said.
   Dukakis's statement ``makes you breathe a little easier,'' said
John Trebes, manager of the space station mockup at the Johnson
center. ``Now, we're on our tippytoes, worrying if we'll be around
next year.''
   Bentsen, following his speech to the Chamber of Commerce
luncheon, denied Dukakis's announcement represents a conversion.
   ``I think he was wise to have insisted on counsel ... before
making any decision,'' Bentsen told reporters, adding that he was
one of those consulted by the presidential nominee.
   Rep. Mike Andrews, D-Texas, who accompanied Bentsen in Houston,
called Dukakis's decision ``an extremeley important announcement''
for the campaign in some hotly contested states that have space
facilities. ``It'll help him in Florida, California, Alabama, Texas
and Ohio,'' Andrews said.
   Although Reagan has been supportive, he said, ``the president
didn't mention it in his last State of the Union address. I think
it's a huge issue.''
   Before making his speech, Bentsen climbed into a Space Shuttle
mockup at the space center and chatted with Navy Cmdr. Robert
(Hoot) Gibson, a Shuttle pilot. Bentsen sat in the command seat and
compared the controls with those he used as a B-24 pilot during
World War II.
   ``I can look at a lot of things and have a great deal of
familiarity,'' he said. ``Some of the instruments aren't that far
apart'' from those in older aircraft, he said.
   Bentsen visited the space center during a nine-day campaign
swing that will be spent almost entirely in his home state, where
he is running both for the vice presidency and for re-election to
his Senate seat. Dukakis is scheduled to join Bentsen at the end of
the week for campaign stops and a visit to the LBJ Ranch.
   Bentsen made a quick trip to Little Rock, Ark., Monday afternoon
for a rally with his Senate colleagues from that neighboring state,
Dale Bumpers and David Pryor.
   About 400 supporters cheered them on in a blazing-hot office
building courtyard, as they praised the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket and
blasted the Republicans convening in New Orleans.
   ``I have never seen a crowd so out of touch with reality,''
Bentsen, his shirt soaked with sweat, told the crowd.
   Bentsen said Little Rock had lost 3,700 manufacturing jobs
during the Reagan administration. ``And they're trying to tell you
it's never been better,'' he said.
   ``I think we may be playing for all the marbles this time,'' he
said.
   Bentsen then headed back to Texas for appearances Tuesday in
Beaumont and Fort Worth.

<HEAD>Dotson Attorney Asks Executive Clemency; Says New Test Clears His
Client</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note contents of 15th graf</NOTE>

   A second request for clemency for convicted
rapist Gary Dotson was made Monday to Gov. James Thompson, citing
new high-tech tests Dotson's attorney says support Cathy Webb's
recantation and prove his client's innocence ``beyond a doubt.''
   ``This is a case where a person was arrested, convicted and
sentenced for a crime that never occurred,'' said Dotson's
attorney, Tom Breen.
   Dotson had served six years of a 25- to 50-year sentence
following his 1979 rape conviction when Mrs. Webb stepped forward
to say she had lied when she said he raped her, in order to cover
up a teen-age sexual liaison.
   Thompson, who received results of the test last week, is in New
Orleans for the Republican National Convention.
   Terry Barnich, the governor's legal counsel, said before
Thompson makes a decision on the clemency ``he wants to talk to
some scientific types, to feel comfortable in his own mind whether
this test is scientifically reliable beyond a reasonable doubt.''
   Dotson, meanwhile, remained behind bars Monday at the Joliet
Correctional Center, serving the last day of a six-month prison
term for failing to call his parole officer immediately after
Thompson granted him a ``last chance'' release from prison Dec. 24.
   Testimony before the Illinois Prisoner Review Board showed
Dotson waited until Dec. 26 to call his parole officer. Later that
day, he was arrested in a bar for allegedly starting a fight over a
sandwich.
   That was only one of a number of scrapes with the law Dotson has
had since May 1985, when Thompson commuted his sentence on the
original rape conviction to the six years Dotson had already served.
   In commuting his sentence, Thompson bypassed Dotson's request
for clemency, saying he did not believe Mrs. Webb's recantation nor
Dotson's denials.
   Since that 1985 release, Dotson, 30, has been in jail several
times, convicted of drunken-driving charges and arrested for
allegedly punching his wife and threatening the couple's infant
daughter.
   Under the good-behavior terms of Thompson's ``last-chance''
order, Dotson will remain under parole supervision for three years
and will undergo treatment for an admitted drinking problem.
   Dotson will be released Tuesday into an intensive residential
treatment program for ``an unspecified period of time'' and will
continue to receive out-patient counseling for his alcohol problem,
said Nic Howell, spokesman for the Illinois Department of
Corrections.
   Breen suggested Monday that Dotson's run-ins with the law may
have stemmed from his original imprisonment, and that recent tests
performed by a California forensic serologist prove ``conclusively,
absolutely and definitively that Gary Dotson did not have sex with
Cathy Webb.''
   Results of the test, which involve DNA analysis of blood and
semen samples from Dotson, Webb and her former boyfriend, were
turned over to Breen by Thompson's staff.
   Dr. Edward Blake, who performed the tests, said in a telephone
interview Monday from the San Francisco area that the test
``demonstrates that the semen in Webb's panties did not come from
Dotson, but was compatible with that of her boyfriend.''
   He said results of the test, called Polymerase Chain Reaction,
were submitted in one criminal case in which he testified in
California state courts and were not legally challenged by either
prosecutors or the defense.
   He said he was uncertain whether Illinois courts would allow
test results to be submitted as evidence.
   The actual clemency request Breen made Monday is submitted to
the prison review board, which makes a recommendation and passes
the request on to the governor.

   An Iranian envoy gave a letter
from his government to Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher
during a meeting Monday in which an official said they discussed a
West German hostage held in Lebanon.
   A Foreign Ministry statement said Deputy Foreign Minister
Mohammed-Djabad Larijani delivered a letter from Prime Minister
Hussein Musavi intended for Helmut Kohl, the West German
chancellor. It did not say what was in the letter.
   The government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said hostage Rudolf Cordes was among the topics of discussion in
the meeting Genscher and Larijani had at Frankfurt Airport.
Pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists in Beirut kidnapped Cordes in
January 1987.
   According to the Foreign Ministry, Larijani and Genscher
discussed the cease-fire scheduled for Saturday in the Iran-Iraq
war, and ``bilateral matters.''
   ``Larijani discussed with the foreign minister Iran's position
as to the implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 598
and over the Geneva negotiations and over the reconstruction of his
(Larijani's) country,'' the ministry statement said.

   The Soviet journalists didn't expect to be
treated like honored guests at the Republican National Convention,
but they at least thought they would get housing somewhere in the
city of New Orleans.
   Instead, they are staying at a Holiday Inn some 60 miles from
the Superdome, where the convention is being held, in the outlying
town of Hammond.
   Three Washington-based Soviets from the news service Tass and
newspaper Pravda said their drive to the convention site is even

Department.
   They also had to book their rooms through the department, which
is routine, said Vitaly Gan of Pravda.
   He said they asked for their rooms in April and were told
everything in New Orleans was booked up.
   State Department officials told them, ``There are no rooms. No

   ``They said you're lucky not to be in Baton Rouge,'' added Oleg
Polyakovsky of Tass.
   At the State Department in Washington, spokeswoman Phyllis
Oakley, gave a different version of what happened.
   She said one Soviet request was received in May and another in
July, and that the New Orleans hotels were in fact booked up.
   Some other New York-based Soviets applied in April and were
housed in downtown New Orleans, she said.
   However, one American journalist reported booking a room only
last week downtown, and another said a French Quarter hotel that is
housing many journalists told him space was available on Monday.

   A Swedish tour bus carrying mostly
youngsters slammed into the wall of a tunnel in a mountainous area
of western Norway on Monday, killing at least 12 people, police
said.
   The Swedish Foreign Ministry earlier said 13 people were killed
in the crash outside of Eidsfjord, 120 miles west of Oslo, but
Norwegian police put the death toll at 12.
   Bernt F. Moe, chief constable in the Hardanger district where
the crash occurred, said 34 people were in the tourist bus when the
vehicle hit a tunnel wall about 6:30 p.m. (12:30 p.m. EDT).
   Moe said the bus had Swedish license plates.
   Norway's news agency NTB said 23 of the passengers were
schoolchildren from Stockholm, but it was not reported how many of
those killed were children.
   ``We do not yet know why the accident happened, but it is a
mountainous area with steep hills and the road curves in several of
the tunnels in the area,'' Moe said.
   ``Practically all survivors were injured in one way or the other
... and all of them now have been taken to hospitals by helicopters
and ambulances that were directed to the site,'' Moe said.
   It was not immediately known where the bus originated or its
destination. Moe said the the bus was traveling in the direction of
Bergen, on Norway's western coast.

   Demonstrators sought to disrupt a rally for
evangelist Pat Robertson and focus attention on the homeless and
AIDS as the Republican National Convention got under way Monday.
   Police said six demonstrators were arrested outside the hotel
where the Robertson rally was underway.
   While most rallies were peaceful, a shoving match broke out near
a fence outside the Superdome, the convention site, when some of
about 50 people protesting federal policy on acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, or AIDS, tried to push their way past. No one
was arrested.
   Before they arrived at the Superdome, protesters gave brief
speeches calling for more government support for social and medical
programs for AIDS victims. Then they lay down on the steps of city
hall for what they called a ``die-in.''
   At Lafayette Park, about six blocks from city hall and the
Superdome, officials had set up a small stage and sound system for
demonstrators to reserve 90-minute slots. The stage was empty much
of the day.
   One of the speakers, Na'im Dai-Y, head of the New Orleans
Coalition for the Homeless, said more attention should be paid to
the issues which prompted the demonstrations.
   Protest organizers have lamented about light turnouts at several
events. Dana Beal, 41, a demonstrator from New York, said many
groups are complacent about the fall elections.
   ``There's no turnout because everybody thinks George Bush is a
goner. He's behind in the polls,'' Beal said.
   The climate is another factor with both parties' conventions
held in the South this summer.
   It's difficult to ``persuade people to go from one hot place to
another hot place,'' Beal said.
   Daytime temperature in New Orleans have been in the 90s. Similar
conditions prevailed at the Democratic National Convention in
Atlanta last month.

   Former Sen. Howard Baker said Monday he
helped review a long list of potential running mates for certain
Republican nominee George Bush and told the vice president he was
not interested in the job.
   ``Late last week, I went over a long list of names and I sort of
critiqued them for him,'' Baker, former White House chief of staff,
told a news conference.
   Baker said he and Bush also had discussed the Tennessean's
prospects of joining Bush on the ticket.``We discussed it at some
length and he understands that I'm truly not interested,'' Baker
said.
   Baker said he managed to unload some heavy responsibility when
he resigned as White House chief of staff. But with all the talk
about his becoming vice president, he said, ``I feel somebody's
trying to revoke my parole.''
   Baker was at the Republican National Convention for a reception
honoring first lady Nancy Reagan and spoke to reporters later at a
reception for the state's Republican congressmen.

   Republican Senate candidates paraded their
wares at the GOP national convention Monday as the coordinator of
their drive to regain control of the Senate said none of them will
ever be ``outhustled'' by their Democratic opponents.
   Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., chairman of the Republican
Senatorial Campaign Committee, predicted the GOP will regain
control of the Senate in November because of good organization,
good candidates, good financing and a series of ``surprises,''
although he acknowleged that at the moment ``12 to 15 seats can
still go either way.''
   Thirty-two Senate seats are at risk this fall. The Republicans
hold 17 of those seats, the Democrats have 15.
   Boschwitz was optimistic.
   ``We think the GOP can regain control of the United States
Senate in 1988,'' he said. ``We think it's in the realm of reason
no matter how you look at it. These are good candidates. None of
them is going to be outhustled.''
   He predicted that the Republicans will take five of the six
states left open by retirements.
   He acknowleged that Republican candidates are behind in some
states. But he added: ``We think a number of these guys are going
to pull through.''
   Democrats won conntrol of the Senate in 1986 and now hold it
with a majority of 54-46.
   Boschwitz introduced the candidates at a news conference and
allotted 60 seconds of exposure to each of 16 candidates. Many took
longer than that.
   Susan Engeleiter, minority leader of the Wisconsin State Senate,
reported that her name identification is up from 15 percent to 65
percent.
   Pete Dawkins of New Jersey said that he has raised $5 million in
his race against Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., and is looking to
raise another $2 million.
   Alan Keyes of Maryland, a black former ambassador, said he will
defeat veteran Democrat Paul Sarbanes and demonstrate that ``we can
split any bloc and take any vote.''
   Sen. David Karnes, R-Neb., who said his first poll showed a name
recognition factor of 1 percent, said he has pulled to a 44-44
deadheat with his opponent.
   Rep. Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he has achieved ``momentum'' in
his drive to replace Sen. John Stennis, D-Miss., who is retiring.
   Robert McMillan, a New York lawyer, said that he is introducing
``one new positive issue a week'' in his drive to defeat Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., whom he accused of absenting
himself from the Senate to write books.
   Rep. Beau Boulter, R-Texas., claimed he has a good chance to
unseat Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, who is simultaneously running
for vice president.
   ``Our prediction is that Lloyd Bentsen will fall off both horses
he's trying to ride at the same time,'' Boulter said.
   Jay Wolfe, a Wwest Virginia businessman, claimed he has a chance
to unhorse Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W. Va., the Senate majority
leader. Byrd was first electyed to the Sernate in 1958.
   Equally optimistic was Joe Malone, a Massachusetts businessman,
who denied he is in the race against Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., as ``a sacrificial lamb.''
   ``I'm hearing people saying that 25 years of Ted Kennedy is
enough,'' he said. ``You're going to have the upset of the century.

   Conservative Republicans, two of them vice
presidential hopefuls, paid tribute Monday to Phyllis Schlafly,
blasted Michael Dukakis and hailed what they hoped will be a GOP
triumph in November.
   Rep. Jack Kemp of New York called Mrs. Schlafly's Eagle Forum
``the most effective lobbying organization on behalf of a good
cause in the United States today.''
   Mrs. Schlafly, the conservative anti-feminist activist, returned
the compliment, calling Kemp the most exciting champion of SDI'' _
President Reagan's Star Wars missile defense system _ and ``the man
I think is the quarterback of the Reagan economic recovery.''
   About 40 people chanting ``Bigots for Bush'' demonstrated
outside the party at the New Orleans Museum of Art as various
luminaries arrived in their limousines. The protest was staged by
Act Up, a coalition which opposes what they view as inaction by the
government on the AIDS crisis.
   ``We're here to protest the cream of the right wing, who have
led the fight against people with AIDS, against lesbians and
gays,'' said Maxine Wolfe, of Brooklyn, N.Y.
   The forum presented brass clocks to Kemp and Jeane Kirkpatrick,
both vice presidential hopefuls; and to Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas,
Education Secretary William Bennett and Robert Bork, the former
federal appeals judge whose nomination to the Supreme Court was
rejected by the Senate.
   ``I certainly wish this had been the audience I was talking to
in the Senate Judiciary Committee,'' said Bork, whose appearance
drew the loudest applause.
   Bennett said Mrs. Schlafly's group had ``done more for the cause
of freedom in the world and moral decency in the country.'' He said
the two issues in the campaign were ``defense and freedom in the
world'' and ``nurture of children.''
   ``On both of them the Democrats are wrong and the Republican
Party is right,'' he said.
   Bork said that if the Dukakis is elected to the White House,
``the judges will effectively be chosen by Edward Kennedy,'' the
liberal Massachusetts senator who is a ranking Democrat on the
Judiciary Committee.

<TEXT>
   America's ambassador to China said Monday that
during a visit to Tibet he expressed concern about human rights
violations and asked the region's government to lift restrictions
on foreign journalists and other travelers.
   Ambassador Winston Lord Lord said he told Doje Cering, chairman
of the Tibet Autonomous Region, that ``if they want to have
informed reporting they ought to let in journalists as well as
anyone else.''
   Lord visited the Tibetan capital of Lhasa and the city of Xigaze
Aug. 4-10. He was the first U.S. ambassador to visit the remote
western region.
   Tibet, ruled by China, has been closed to all but a few selected
foreign reporters since pro-independence riots in Lhasa last fall
and again in March. Tibet had been trying to build a tourist
industry, but it also banned individual travelers, permitting only
organized group tours, after the violence.
   Fourteen foreign reporters who went to Lhasa to cover the
October riots were expelled from Tibet.
   Lord said Doje Cering ``seemed responsive.'' He did not
elaborate.
   The ambassador said that in his two-hour meeting with Doje
Cering he also brought up the issues of human rights and the status
of prisoners detained after the disturbances.
   China accused the U.S. Congress of interfering in its internal
affairs after the passage of several congressional resolutions last
year calling for an end to human rights violations in Tibet.
   Lord said Doje Cering told him that the human rights situation
has improved in Tibet since the Chinese Communists ended the
theocracy headed by the Dalai Lama, the spiritual head of Tibetan
Buddhism.
   Tibet came under Chinese military and political control in
1950-51. The Dalai Lama fled to India after a failed nationalist
revolt in 1959 and Tibet was made an autonomous region of China in
1965. Lord noted the United States recognizes China's sovereignty
over the region.
   The anti-Chinese demonstrations in October 1987 and last March
were led by Tibetan monks loyal to the Dalai Lama. They accuse the
Chinese government of undermining Tibetan social and religious
customs.
   Lord said Doje Cering told him that only 25 or 26 of the more
than 200 people detained after the March rioting remained in
prison, and eight of those still jailed were Buddhist monks or
nuns. It is beleved several dozen people were killed during the
violence in March.
   Lord said he asked permission for a U.S. official to visit a
jail but there was no immediate response.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said
Monday he has no reason to believe he will be selected as
Republican George Bush's running mate, and that it would be
``presumptuous'' to say whether he would accept such an offer.
   ``I'll be back on the job tomorrow in Washington,'' Thornburgh,
the former two-term, Pennsylvania governor, told reporters at a
rally sponsored by his state's GOP convention delegation.
   Thornburgh said he was in town only to hear President Reagan's
address to the convention Monday night.
   Asked how he would respond to an offer from the all-but-certain
nominee for the vice presidency, Thornburgh hesitated before
replying: ``That's a presumptuous kind of a statement to make. I
have no reason to think that's going to happen.''
   Thornburgh was sworn in as the successor to former attorney
general Edwin Meese III on Friday.
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., a member of the Judiciary Committee
that heaped praise on Thornburgh during his confirmation hearing,
said senators would understand if Thornburgh left after less than a
week on the job.
   ``Obviously the Justice Department is very important. We pushed
hard to move things quickly (with confirmation),'' Specter said.
   ``But my sense is people would feel this is important _ if the
vice presidency gives him a higher calling, that's that,'' he said.
   Specter, who favors Kansas Sen. Bob Dole for the No. 2 spot on
the ticket, said he did not know what Thornburgh's chances were of
getting the nod.

<HEAD>Police Chief Rescinds Order To Stop Black Youths</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The police chief Monday yielded to pressure
from civil rights leaders and rescinded a policy requiring officers
to randomly stop black youths in a racially mixed neighborhood.
   Chief Martin Felker issued an order July 8 that police stop and
question groups of black teen-agers in what he called an effort to
end racial violence in Old West End neighborhood.
   ``The procedure was implemented to address a series of crimes
that had been committed,'' Felker said in a statement Monday
afternoon. ``Unfortunately, the focus of the directive has been
perceived as racially motivated instead of the intent of focusing
on the suspects involved.''
   The statement apparently was issued to clarify reports earlier
Monday that Felker had just dropped the word ``black'' from his
directive. The statement said he had rescinded the order and
directed his officers to return to normal procedures of stopping
people only if police believe reasonable cause exists.
   Felker's decision followed meetings with the president of the
Toledo chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, city officials and neighborhood residents.
   A group of black lawyers hailed Felker's decision but said a $1
million federal lawsuit against the city would not be withdrawn.
   ``The suit will continue, and we expect more plaintiffs to join
us. The policy was patently racist,'' said Lafayette Tolliver, vice
president of the Thurgood Marshall Law Association.
   The group filed the lawsuit Friday on behalf of Walter Wade Jr.,
a black teen-ager who was followed and stopped by police in front
of his house but never charged with a crime.
   The lawsuit said the policy violates the constitutional
protections against illegal search and seizure.
   U.S. District Judge John Potter rejected the group's request for
a temporary restraining order after learning Felker had rescinded
his directive.
   Blacks make up about 17 percent of the city's population of
340,000.

   Republicans ridiculed Michael Dukakis from
the opening bell of their 34th national convention Monday as they
rallied behind George Bush's come-from-behind quest for the White
House. Delegates reached out for a final, emotional embrace with
President Reagan.
   Bush viewed the proceedings from afar, saying he hadn't settled
on a vice presidential partner for the fall campaign. But that
didn't stop the rumor mill _ or the jockeying by Rep. Jack Kemp,
Sen. Dan Quayle and the others interested in the post.
   Party chairman Frank Fahrenkopf had hardly pounded the opening
gavel at the Superdome podium when a parade of speakers began
thumping the Democrats. ``Americans know that Michael Dukakis will
trash them,'' said Alexander M. Haig Jr., Bush's one-time rival in
the primary campaign. He dismissed the Democratic candidate as a
``diminutive clerk from Massachusetts'' in a speech that drew a
disclaimer from the Bush campaign.
   ``Your party has lost its way, our party has found the way,''
former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont said in an appeal aimed at
Democrats.
   Bush's convention city arrival was set for Tuesday. But he had
no trouble making his presence felt, from his round of morning
television interviews to the notice to the news media that eight of
his 10 grandchildren would be visiting the city zoo.
   Outside the vast Superdome, six demonstrators were arrested at a
rally for evangelist Pat Robertson, one of several of Bush's
vanquished primary campaign rivals.
   
   FOLLOWING EMBARGOED FOR 9:30 p.m. EDT

<TEXT>
   
   Inside the convention hall, the Republicans were praising the
man who twice led them to victory and declaring that Bush would
pilot the party to greater heights.
   In remarks prepared for delivery, Rep. Jack Kemp likened Reagan
to Abraham Lincoln for giving the ``whole world a birth of
freedom.'' He said, ``Mr. President, this is a powerful legacy that
you are handing us...I just want you and Nancy to know that under
the able leadership of George Bush, this party is going to take it
and run with it.''

   It was Reagan's last full day in the spotlight at Bush's
convention, complete with an affectionate birthday party tribute to
his wife. ``In front of all our friends here today, let me say
thank you for all you do, thank you for your love and thank you for
just being you,'' he said.
   Said the first lady: ``We have had a wonderful run, but today it
is time for the Bushes to step into the political leading roles and
for the Reagans to step into the wings.''
   Republicans hoped that Bush's turn at center stage would
dramatically improve his standing against Dukakis. Most polls
indicate the vice president trailing, and a new ABC News poll gave
the Massachusetts governor a double-digit advantage.
   The vice president told interviewers that he hadn't settled on a
partner for the fall campaign, and hinted that some surprise names
were still on his private list. ``Nice try,'' was his
non-informative reply when one interviewer tried to penetrate the
secrecy.
   If there was no news about his pick, there was no shortage of
interest.
   ``We're trying to get Barbara Bush to put a recorder under the
vice president's pillow,'' said Barbara Campbell, GOP chairwoman in
Montana.
   Many of the contenders were in town for the convention and
related caucuses and receptions, some of them practically
auditioning for the job and others professing bewilderment that
they even figured in the speculation.
   ``If I were to be asked, I would be a terrific campaigner, and a
terrific candidate and a terrific vice president,'' said Kemp.
   ``We're not running,'' Sen. Bob Dole insisted as his wife and
co-contender Elizabeth sat at his side. But ``when the phone rings
she says, `Well, let me get it,''' he teased.
   But former Senate Majority Leader and White House chief of staff
Howard Baker said, ``I've no desire to be vice president.'' Quipped
Sen. William Armstrong, ``They can't possibly call me now, I have
an unlisted number.''
   Convention organizers passed the word that they would soon
assign aides to draft ``generic speeches'' for use by the person
Bush ultimately selects.
   Bush said he felt the ``pressure mounting'' as his big moment
approached. ``But I don't feel concerned about it. I have to be
what I am'' he said on ABC.

   Sen. Dan Quayle said Monday he would be
George Bush's running mate if asked, but that ``from a personal
standpoint'' he wouldn't choose to run for national office this
year.
   The Indiana senator, said to be on Bush's short list of
prospective vice presidential nominees, said he has reservations
about his candidacy's effect on his family. Quayle, 41, is married
and has three children.
   ``From a personal standpoint, if I had a time in my life to be
vice president, I wouldn't choose this time,'' he said.
   But, he added: ``If George Bush thinks I can offer the most to
the ticket ... Dan Quayle will sign up immediately.''
   His wife, Marilyn, also said she has reservations about ``the
total lack of privacy.'' Whether her husband gets the nomination or
not ``it's fine,'' she said. ``I'm not panting after it.''
   Quayle said his 14-year-old son, Tucker, is fascinated by the
prospect of his father running for vice president. Benjamin, the
Quayle's 11-year-old son, is ambiguous, his father said, and
9-year-old Corinne doesn't like the idea of her father spending
more time away from home.
   ``She told me, `Daddy, I really hope George Bush picks Bob
Dole,''' Quayle said. ``I said, `It may happen.'''
   In case he is selected, Quayle has begun to think about an
acceptance speech to the Republican National Convention.
   ``I haven't sat down to write. I think that would be bad luck,''
he said. ``But I do have some ideas.''

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of people turned
the funeral for three-time President Arnulfo Arias Madrid into a
huge but peaceful anti-government demonstration Monday.
   It was one of the largest demonstrations in 14 months of
protests against the rule of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who
commands Panama's Defense Forces and controls the civilian
government.
   Arias was elected three times and overthrown each time by the
military. He died Wednesday in Miami.
   Arias, who would would have been 87 Monday, spent more time in
jail and exile than in office but was credited with founding
Panama's social security system and introducing women's suffrage.
   A vast crowd gathered in the plaza in front of the Metropolitan
Cathedral for the funeral that was conducted from the church steps.
   As the service ended and the coffin was placed aboard a
firetruck a roar went up from the crowd, with the people repeatedly
shouting ``Justice!''
   Thousands of people followed the cortege out of the plaza,
through the narrow streets of the old section of Panama City and
onto Central Avenue, for the three-mile journey to a cemetery. With
each block te procession became longer until people filled the
four-lane avenue for nearly a mile.
   ``Arnulfo president, Noriega criminal!'' people in the crowd
shouted. ``Noriega must go.''
   Many people waved white banners, a sign of protest in Panama, or
the flags of political parties opposed to Noriega who was indicted
by two federal grand juries in Florida last February on charges of
narcotics trafficking.
   The government offered to provide military honors at the funeral
but the Authentic Panamanian Party, which Arias founded in 1935,
refused. Instead, the party decided on the requiem Mass conducted
on the cathedral steps by Marcos McGrath, the Roman Catholic
archbishop.
   ``We can't accept that those who always overthrew the doctor
(Arias) share in our grief,'' said Francisco Artola, party vice
president. ``The ceremony is going to be for the people.''
   Noriega's soldiers and police, who have crushed dozens of
protests in the past 14 months, did not interfere with the funeral
despite the anti-government tone.
   Firefighters helped control the cathedral crowd and one of their
bright orange ladder trucks carried the flag-draped coffin to the
Garden of Peace cemetery.
   All sides in this politically divided country claimed Arias as
their own.
   Government-controlled newspapers referred vaguely to his
``errors'' during 57 years in politics, but praised his nationalism
and defiance of the United States.
   U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis and his daughter, Susan, were among
the mourners Monday.
   Arias was first turned out of office by a military coup July 14,
1941, after serving 9{ months of a four-year term. In January of
that year, he had rejected a U.S. War Department request for land
for military bases along the Panama Canal.
   Soon after Arias was deposed at Washington's urging, Panama
provided 37,000 acres for the bases.
   He was elected again in 1949 but tossed out by the army in 1951.
He began his third elected term Oct. 1, 1968, but was overthrown 11
days later in a coup led by Gen. Omar Torrijos, whom Noriega
replaced as head of the 15,000-member Defense Forces.
   Four years ago Arias ran for president again and lost to Nicolas
Ardito Barletta, Noriega's candidate, in an election widely viewed
as fraudulent. The government said Ardito Barletta won by 1,713
votes.
   Arias died of a heart attack. He had gone to Florida for medical
treatment last April and remained there until his death.

   Here is a sampling of foreign opinion on the Republic National
Convention which opened Monday in New Orleans.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WEST GERMANY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Frankfurter Rundschau, a left-leaning daily:
   ``In the coming four days, (George) Bush must show the U.S.A.
that he is the worthy heir to ... Ronald Reagan.
   ``He must prove that he is really as good as his supporters say
and not so indecisive and wishy-washy as the Democrats and a large
part of the media portray him.''
   _Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, a conservative newspaper:
   ``George Bush, in the role of crown prince, will have to fight
against numerous image problems.
   ``Trailing in the opinion polls, ... (he) will try to present a
picture of himself during the Louisiana gathering that is hoped to
shorten the distance between him and his (Democratic) rival,
Michael Dukakis.''
   _Die Welt, a conservative, Bonn-based daily:
   ``It is the most critical nominating convention for the
Republicans in the last 12 years. They have not had to operate so
much on the defense since Jimmy Carter challenged incumbent Gerald
Ford.
   ``The Republicans now realize that for them Reagan is an
indispensable factor in their presidential election campaign.''
   A West German television ARD report showed segments Monday of
President and Mrs. Reagan's arrival at the convention.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FRANCE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Le Figaro, a conservative newspaper in a report from its
correspondent in New Orleans:
   ``The Republicans asked themselves for a long time: should
Reagan and Bush appear together in New Orleans? The GOP delegates
do not hide their preference for the incumbent president and a
certain lukewarm feeling about the candidate Bush. It was therefore
judged more reasonable that the two men simply shake hands Tuesday
morning as they pass at the military airport at New Orleans.
   ``So tomorrow George Bush takes charge of the party.''
   _Le Monde, an afternoon daily, published a front-page cartoon
showing Reagan gesturing toward Bush, and saying, ``Believe me,
Dukakis is worse.''
   Le Monde correspondent Jan Krauze wrote:
   ``Mr. George Bush remains, after 7{ years as vice president and
more than a year of campaigning, a man about whom there are
questions ... A man who, despite eminent strengths and a long
experience in public life, has never succeeded in showing a quality
that is elementary but essential at this stage: that he really has
the stuff of a candidate, let alone that of a president.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SWEDEN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Expressen, a liberal Stockholm newspaper:
   ``Is George Bush the right man as the next president in the
White House? ... Alas, there is the chance the image of Bush will
still be slightly blurred when ... (the convention) is over ...
Something appears to be stagnant, too stagnant around the
politician George Bush.''
   _Dagens Nyheter, independent:
   ``The Republican party convention in New Orleans will hardly be
exciting. ...
   ``An undeniable fact is that the Republicans' slogan `Peace and
Prosperity' is their best weapon against the Democrats. ... If Bush
simply manages to articulate this message of Republican triumph at
the convention ... he has won half the battle for the presidency.''

<TEXT>
   Vice President Salvador Laurel began
meeting opposition leaders Monday to form a new political party
opposed to President Corazon Aquino, whom he accused of
incompetence.
   Laurel met with Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, members of ousted
President Ferdinand Marcos' New Society Movement and other
opposition groups at the Club Pilipino, where Mrs. Aquino took her
oath as president on Feb. 25, 1986.
   Enrile and Laurel said at a news conference later that more
meetings would be held to unite the opposition and seek Mrs.
Aquino's ouster.
   ``We are just starting the evolution to unify the political
parties,'' said Enrile, the only opposition member in the 23-seat
Senate.
   ``Maybe then the administration will know there is a quiet
opposition strong enough to make a challenge.''
   Laurel said Saturday that Mrs. Aquino had failed to provide
strong leadership in the face of the country's communist rebellion
and in other economic and social crises.
   He urged her to step down and call new elections, and promised
to resign himself if she did. If she refused, he would stay in
office and join the opposition, Laurel said.
   Laurel told reporters Monday he had not received a reply from
Mrs. Aquino and could not say when he would formally announce an
alliance with the opposition.
   ``I do not want to pressure Mrs. Aquino,'' he added. ``The
moment it becomes obvious that she will not be stepping down, I
will be a free agent.''
   Mrs. Aquino has not commented directly on Laurel's call. But she
accused the vice president Saturday of withholding public support
during coup attempts in 1986 and in August 1987.
   Asked the president's reaction to Laurel's meeting Monday with
the opposition, spokesman Teodoro Benigno quoted Mrs. Aquino as
saying: ``I was under the impression they were together all along.''
   Sen. Sotero Laurel, the vice president's brother, told the upper
house he would remain with the administration, saying ``there is no
reason for me to dissociate myself from the coalition.''
   Previous opposition attempts to form a united political alliance
have faltered, mainly due to personal rivalries. Mrs. Aquino's
supporters rolled up landslides in congressional elections in May
1987.
   Mrs. Aquino ran under the banner of Salvador Laurel's United
Nationalist Democratic Organization in February 1986 elections that
led to Marcos' ouster after 20 years in power.
   Manila newspapers reported recently that 21 of 22 members of
that party were defecting to pro-Aquino parties. Many members left
the party last year.
   Enrile, fired as defense minister in November 1986 after a coup
attempt by his followers, said the opposition would stick to
constitutional methods and not attempt a coup.
   Share prices on the Manila Stock Exchange declined 5.92 points
Monday. Some traders said Laurel's announcement may have raised
fears among foreign investors about political stability here.

   Here, at a glance, are some of Monday's
developments at the Republican National Convention.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Reagan Prepares `Very Personal' Address</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan, in a valedictory address to the Republican
National Convention, challenged the GOP delegates to ``never let
the fire go out or quit the fight.''
   ``I'm grateful to God for blessing me with a good life and a
long one,'' Reagan said in an address that mixed reminiscence of
his nearly eight years in the White House with praise for George
Bush, the GOP presidential nominee-in-waiting.
   The Monday night timing of the speech was picked by Reagan to
avoid stealing the spotlight from Bush, who officially becomes the
Republican presidential nominee Wednesday night.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Nancy Reagan Honored at GOP Luncheon</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Reagan surprised his wife, Nancy, with an unscheduled appearance
Monday at a luncheon in her honor.
   ``I really can't imagine these last eight years without Nancy,''
he said. ``She once said the president has all kinds of advisers
and experts ... when it comes to foreign policy, the economy or
whatever, but no one to look after his needs as a human being.
Well, Nancy has done that.''
   Mrs. Reagan, moist-eyed at the tribute, said, ``The Republican
Party has given Ronnie and me eight of the most wonderful years we
have ever had.''
   But she added, ``Today the curtain begins to close on the Reagan
era of the Republican Party. We have had a wonderful run, but today
it is time for the Bushes to step into the political leading roles
and for the Reagans to step into the wings.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Bush Readies Acceptance Speech</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush, putting the finishing touches on his speech accepting the
GOP presidential nomination, conceded that Reagan will be a tough
act to follow.
   But he said he hoped to put his own stamp on the convention and
``not try to be a Ronald Reagan. There is only one.''
   Bush planned to watch Reagan's speech to the convention on
television at the vice presidential residence in Washington before
flying to New Orleans on Tuesday.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Potential Running Mates Make the Rounds</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Potential Republican vice presidents made a whirlwind round of
appearances Monday, some openly touting their qualifications,
others playing coy. In Washington, Bush said he still hadn't made
up his mind.
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas said he and his
wife, former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole, left a
message on their telephone answering machine back in Washington:
``Just in case they got the wrong number. It just says, `I
accept.'''
   Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana told the Ohio delegation, ``I'm here
because George Bush knows who I am. He decided to put me on a
list.'' And Rep. Jack Kemp told reporters, ``I would be a terrific
campaigner and a terrific candidate and a terrific vice president.''

<HEAD>Party's Also-Rans Step Into Spotlight _ Briefly</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Once bickering rivals taking aim on Bush's shortcomings, the
five men he bested in the Republican primaries assembled here this
week to sing his praises, attack Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis
and _ in at least one case _ pull a surprise.
   Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont improbably beckoned the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, the Democratic runner-up, to switch to the GOP. ``We need
you and you need us,'' du Pont said. ``As long as you have breath
yours will be a prominent voice, but as long as you speak as a
Democrat, you will never be a successful leader.'' The proposal was
greeted with silence by delegates.
   Alexander M. Haig Jr. contrasted Bush's ``safe and progressive''
policies with those of Dukakis, whom he called the ``diminutive
clerk from Massachusetts.''
   Du Pont and Haig spoke at Monday's opening morning session.
Dole, Kemp and Pat Robertson will speak in evening sessions on
prime-time TV.

<HEAD>Party Time Rolls On</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Lindy Boggs, a Louisiana Democrat, put aside political
differences to repay a political favor and on Monday hosted
visiting Republicans to celebrate at her house on bustling Bourbon
Street.
   Other festivities included welcomes for Robertson's die-hard
delegates, evening cruises on the Mississippi River and the start
of a three-night outdoor engagement by jazz trumpeter Al Hirt.
   In 1976, Boggs helped plan the Democratic National Convention in
New York City, and she recalled the warm welcome from the
Republicans among her hosts.

   People heading for work were confronted
by a train that remained stalled across a street for almost two
hours during rush hour Monday because its crew had reached the
maximum hours it could work legally.
   A Union Pacific spokesman confirmed that a Tidewater Southern
freight was stalled at a crossing in Modesto from 6:30 a.m. until
after 8 a.m. because of a communications mixup over crews.
   One crew had worked the maximum 12 hours allowed under federal
law, and another crew wasn't called soon enough to get to Modesto
in time, said Ron Ahearn, manager of Union Pacific's terminal
operations in Stockton.
   Police said traffic was rerouted to other streets.

   Two Israeli F-15 jet fighters on a training

   It said Maj. Gen. Avihu Bin-Nun, the air force commander,
appointed a commission to investigate.
   The announcement was held up about 12 hours and gave no further
details. Strict censorship delays release of information on events
considered to involve national security.
   The army identified the pilots as Maj. Ehud Falk of the northern
Israeli kibbutz, or communal settlement, of Merhavya, and Lt. Col.
Ram Kuller of the northern kibbutz of Kfar Giladi.
   Informed sources in Washington said it was the first known
accident Israel's air force has had with the high-flying
American-built Eagle.
   Israel has about 50 of the planes, manufactured by the McDonnell
Douglas Corp., and ordered five more earlier in the summer.
   They were used with deadly force in an air war with Syria a
decade ago. More than 80 Syrian jets were shot down. None of the
Israeli F-15s were lost.
   The lopsided Israeli victory, and triumphs in other wars with
Arab enemies, has created an aura of pride and proficiency envied
by other air forces around the world.
   Two other F-15s, owned by Japan, crashed last June. The planes
cost about $30 million apiece.
   Normally, Israeli training exercises with the high-flying jets
are conducted over the Negev desert in the southern area of the
country, but speculation about Monday's accident centered on the
Israeli-held West bank.
   The F-15, nicknamed the Eagle by the U.S. Air Force, is the most
advanced, land-based jet fighter in the American inventory. The
twin-engine jet is designed to fly and fight in all weather
conditions and can soar at more than 2{ times the speed of sound.
   Israel is one of few foreign countries that has been allowed to
acquire the plane. Even so, the Eagles in its possession are not
the most advanced version of the F-15 produced by McDonnell Douglas.
   In recent years, the F-15's safety record has helped the U.S.
Air Force reduce its overall accident rate to some of the lowest
marks ever.
   The U.S. Air Force has had three mid-air mishaps involving F-15s
this year, but in each case the plane was only damaged, managed to
land without further incident and there were no fatalities.
   Overall, the Air Force said, there have been 15 mid-air
accidents.
   The F-15 was first flown in the United States in 1972 and was
delivered to U.S. Air Force combat squadrons beginning in 1976.
Since then, the Eagle has chalked up an overall accident rate of
3.0 mishaps per 100,000 flight hours, which for a jet fighter is
very low.
   The F-15 is normally armed with one internal 20mm cannon and two
types of air-to-air ``dogfighting'' missiles, the Sparrow and
Sidewinder. The single-seat fighter has a combat altitude ceiling
of 65,000 feet.

   Wyoming's primary election Tuesday
features a hotly contested Democratic U.S. Senate primary that
could take a week to untangle because of Justice Department
concerns over the handling of absentee ballots.
   State and federal officials tried Monday to avoid a lawsuit that
could leave the Democratic race undecided until next week, but
Secretary of State Kathy Karpan and Attorney General Joseph Meyer
refused to acknowledge that the state had violated federal election
laws.
   Unable to reach an agreement, the Justice Department asked U.S.
District Judge Clarence Brimmer on Monday to order state elections
officials to count any absentee ballots received through Aug. 22.
Brimmer scheduled a hearing on the matter for Tuesday.
   Several weeks ago, the Justice Department told Karpan it would
file a lawsuit over the mailing of absentee ballots since some
county clerks sent the ballots out just 26 days before the primary
instead of at least 30 days.
   Karpan, however, maintains that there are no specific guidelines
governing the mailing of absentee ballots.
   A wide margin of victory in the Senate primary among state Sen.
John Vinich, state schools Superintendent Lynn Simons and
University of Wyoming law professor Pete Maxfield would make the
Justice Department's concerns moot.
   State officials believe that less than 1,000 absentee ballots
are involved in the controversy, and with GOP registration in
Wyoming approaching 60 percent it's possible that just 400 of those
ballots were sent to Democrats and so only an extremely tight race
would be affected by those ballots.
   Meyer and Karpan pointed that out Monday to Justice Department
officials, who refused to wait until after the primary to decide
whether to take the state to court, said Karpan.
   The secretary of state, as a precaution against a court order,
did advise all 23 county clerks to hold any absentee ballots
received after the polls close Tuesday for at least one week.
   The Justice Department flap capped a primary election campaign
dominated by the Democratic Senate race, which easily overshadowed
uncompetitive U.S. House contests and state legislative races.
   Vinich, the first to seek the Democratic Senate nomination,
became labor's favorite and later attracted support from
environmentalists. Simons counted on the success of her three
previous campaigns for superintendent of public instruction.
Maxfield is a political neophyte.
   Incumbent U.S. Sen. Malcolm Wallop faced little opposition in
the Republican primary and spent much of the months leading up to
the election reconstructing a campaign machine that twice before
had led him to victory in November.
   When he did campaign, Wallop stressed the record he has built
over the past 12 years, pointing to his support of Western water
rights, a strong defense, and efforts to reduce the tax burdens on
the oil and gas industries.
   In the races for Wyoming's only House seat, Bryan Sharratt was
unopposed for the Democratic nomination while five-term incumbent
Republican Dick Cheney faced Bob Morris, who two years ago lost by
63,520 votes.
   If Cheny wins, his campaign would get off to a slow start. He's
scheduled to undergo heart bypass surgery Friday.

   An estimated 5,000 people claiming the July
elections were fraudulent clogged the steps of the Congress
building Monday as legislators began the process of certifying
election results.
   The crowd parted as Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, presidential candidate
of the leftist National Democratic Front, arrived to address
Congress. People showered Cardenas with confetti and shouted
insults at the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, known
as the PRI.
   Cardenas told the legislators: ``What we are asking the members
of the Electoral College is one thing _ responsibility.
   ``We are asking that the elections be cleaned up ... of the
innumerable irregularities committed in the electoral process
principally by representatives of the official party, by municipal,
state and federal authorities.''
   The 64-member Senate and 500 members of the Chamber of Deputies
serve as the Electoral College, and the session is scheduled to run
through Aug. 31. Senators will certify election results for Senate
seats and the deputies will certify the results for seats in the
lower house. The Chamber of Deputies then will certify the count in
the presidential balloting.
   According to the Federal Election Commission, PRI candidate
Carlos Salinas de Gortari won the presidential contest with 50.36
percent of the vote. It said Cardenas, a former PRI governor and
senator who broke with the party last year over democratic reform,
received 31.12 percent, and Manuel J. Clouthier, candidate of the
conservative National Action Party, obtained 17.07 percent.
   The PRI has governed Mexico since 1929, dominating both national
and state politics, and it is virtually certain that the
legislators will name Salinas president-elect in the final stage of
this year's election process.
   The new president will be inaugurated Dec. 1, replacing
President Miguel de La Madrid who is completing his six-year term
and could not run for re-election under Mexican law.
   For the first two weeks of the Electoral College session the
legislators will review the results of the congressional races. The
results for 26 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and at least one
Senate seat are being challenged.
   Both right-wing and left-wing parties have accused the PRI of
fraud in the July 6 elections and have held protest rallies almost
daily.
   Opposition leaders claim the PRI cheated at the polling places
and doctored the voter registration rolls and totals released by
the Federal Election Commission.
   Despite the allegations, the election may have been the most
open since the PRI was founded in 1929.
   For the first time, the opposition won seats in the Senate,
gaining four although one is being challenged. And the PRI will
have have to contend with at least 227 opposition deputies in the
lower house, which has been expanded from 400 to 500 seats. The PRI
had 289 seats in the old, 400-seat chamber.
   The final count depends on the certification of the Electoral
College.
   In all previous presidential races the PRI presidential
candidate received at least 70 percent of the vote.
   The opposition is awaiting with particular interest the separate
returns on the presidential race from about 25,000 of the nation's
nearly 55,000 polling places, which the election commission did not
make public.
   The commission, after a week-long delay, announced overall
totals, saying Salinas, a 40-year-old former budget director, had
won, but it made public the tallies from only about 30,000 polling
places.

   Puerto Rican speakers showed their deep
divisions at the United Nations Monday over whether statehood,
independence or keeping the island's status as a U.S. commonwealth
was the answer to its economic woes.
   The United Nations Decolonization Committee is holding hearings
this week on Puerto Rico's status, athough the United States
already has rejected the committee as anti-American.
   A diplomat on the committee, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the committee probably will issue a resolution Wednesday
calling for self-determination for Puerto Rico.
   William Felice, from an organization called the International
League for the Rights and Liberation of Peoples, said Puerto Rico
has become poorer than any U.S. state and should be granted
independence.
   But Manuel Medina, a member of a group called Puerto Ricans for
Statehood Inc., told the committee Puerto Rico would benefit more
by achieving statehood. Medina said the island still could preserve
its Spanish culture.
   Other speakers said the United States was actively trying to
block the pro-independence movement.
   Cuban Ambassador Oscar Oramas-Oliva introduced a resolution
which noted allegations that the Federal Bureau of Investigation
was using surveillance to keep track of Puerto Rican independence
activists.
   The United States seized Puerto Rico in 1898 during the
Spanish-American War. Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens.
   In 1952, Puerto Rican voters overwhelmingly passed a referendum
favoring commonwealth status, and the following year the General
Assembly removed Puerto Rico from its list of colonies.
   Since 1973, the U.N. Decolonization Committee has adopted
numerous resolutions calling Puerto Rico an illegal colony and
demanding self-determination for its people.
   The United States rejected those resolutions as interference in
U.S. internal affairs, and in 1971 walked off the committee, saying
it had an anti-American bias.
   Pro-statehood speakers told the committee Monday that 95 percent
of the island's voters rejected independence in a 1984 election and
that the solution to poverty is to make Puerto Rico the 51st U.S.
state.
   Jan Susler of the National Lawyers Guild described the U.S.
attitude toward the commonwealth as colonial, saying
pro-independence advocates are added to blacklists compiled by the
FBI and shared with the Puerto Rican police.
   She said Washington used the grand jury system to compel friends
and family members of pro-independence advocates to testify about
their activities or face jail, ``a method to politically intern
Puerto Rican independence activists.''
   A pro-statehood advocate, Elsie Valdes Ramos of the Movimiento
Unidos ante la Incertidumbre (the United Movement against
Uncertainty), said Spanish would not atrophy in Puerto Rico.
Rather, she said, mainland America will become bilingual in English
and Spanish, with Puerto Rico leading the way.
   Carlos Vizcarrondo Irizarry spoke for keeping the commonwealth.
He said the present U.S.-Puerto Rico relationship should be
maintained and developed, but he questioned whether the United
States desired to really improve the economy of the island.

<HEAD>Witness Says Liberace's `Penniless' Sister Has Been Paid $132,000</HEAD>

   An accountant testified Monday that the
sister of the late Liberace has been paid nearly $132,000 since his
death 18 months ago and has $511,000 remaining in her trust account.
   The testimony conflicted with that given last week by Angie
Liberace, 74, who described herself as ``penniless.''
   Certified Public Accountant Gary Mohler revealed the figures in
state District Court, in the ongoing legal battle involving efforts
to remove the executor of Liberace's estate.
   Both sides rested Monday after weeks of testimony and closing
arguments were scheduled for Tuesday afternoon. Then it will be up
to Judge Michael Wendell to decide whether to remove Beverly Hills
attorney Joel Strote as executor of the Liberace estate and head of
the Liberace foundation.
   A sister and four former associates have filed suit seeking to
have Strote removed, saying he drew up the will and had Liberace
sign it when the famed pianist was too ill to comprehend what he
was doing.
   Those testifying on the attorney's behalf say Liberace was well
enough to know what he was doing when he signed the will Jan. 22,
1987, and that Strote had done a good job of increasing the value
of the estate.
   Strote testified he did not know what was taking the life of his
famous client until after the will was signed 13 days before
Liberace died Feb. 4, 1987, from AIDS complications.
   Angie Liberace testified last week she was ``penniless'' and had
to live off charity. But Mohler testified Monday that the sister
had been paid an average of $7,755 a month the first 17 months
following her brother's death.
   Mohler discounted the contention that Strote had kept money from
the sister.
   ``Mr. Strote was concerned that Angie be able to get the money
as needed,'' Mohler testified. ``Up until four or five months ago
we had been told to give her almost anything she wanted.''
   Mohler, who oversees the Angie Liberace Irrevocable Trust and
disburses its funds, said in recent months he has been asked to
obtain authority for any expenditures from the trust, which
Liberace set up for his sister.
   Strote testified earlier that he put restrictions on the account
because he was concerned over the rate which the money was being
spent.
   Mohler said he had been a member of the Liberace Foundation for
the Performing Arts since the entertainer formed the foundation in
1979 to provide scholarships at 30 colleges and universities.
Mohler said Strote had conducted foundation meetings since the
organization was formed.

<TEXT>
   One of America's most prominent conservative
families used the start of the Republican National Convention
Monday to announce endorsement of Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s
Democratic opponent in the November election.
   James F.W. Buckley of Tewksbury, Mass., speaking for the Buckley
family of Sharon, Conn., said that although the endorsement came in
a satiric National Review magazine article released Monday, its
intent was serious.
   Buckley, 32-year-old son of former New York Sen. James Buckley
and nephew of conservative columnist and editor William F. Buckley
Jr., announced the formation of ``Buckleys for Lieberman'' to
support Connecticut Attorney General Joseph I. Lieberman.
   The younger Buckley told a news conference attended by three
reporters that the liberal Weicker is an embarrassment to the party
and ``an erratic man. He prides himself on being a pain to the
mainstream of the Republican Party.''
   Weicker, who draws much of his support from Democrats, is rated
20 points more liberal than Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., by
Americans for Democratic Action. Lieberman is a liberal Democrat.
   Weicker laughed off the endorsement and said it would be a boost
to his campaign.
   A spokeswoman for Lieberman, Marla Romash, welcomed the
endorsement, saying, ``We have finally found something where Bill
Buckley and Joe Lieberman agree.''
   Buckley, a computer programmer, hasn't lived in Connecticut
since 1980 and can't vote in the state. His father is now a federal
appeals court judge in Washington and his uncle lives in Stamford,
Conn.
   ``I really don't know that much about Lieberman,'' Buckley
conceded, but added that his family felt that even an unknown
quantity was preferable to Weicker.

   A High Court judge denied bail on Monday
for former Vice President Paul Muwanga, who is charged with murder
with intent to kill.
   Judge Moses Kalanda, however, said Muwanga was free to reapply
for bail within one month if the prosecution failed to put him on
trial during that time.
   Muwanga, 70, has been in and out of jail since October 1986 in
cases arising from his service under ousted civilian President
Milton Obote from 1980-85. Muwanga, later vice president, was
defense minister under Obote when hundreds of Ugandans disappeared
without a trace.
   The government of President Yoweri Museveni, who seized power in
January 1986, set up a commission to investigate such
disappearances. But state prosecutors have not yet managed to
secure convictions in courts, mainly through lack of evidence.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Troops fired without warning into a
group of youths holding a meeting in a remote town north of the
capital, killing 10 people, a Roman Catholic radio station reported
Monday.
   The victims were members of a youth club in Labadie, a small
town about 80 miles north of Port-Au-Prince, according to Radio
Soleil.
   The station attributed the report to a witness who identified
himself as a member of the youth group. Rev. Hugo Trieste, director
of Radio Soleil, said four other members of the group corroborated
the story.
   Monday was a national religious holiday commemorating the Feast
of Assumption and attempts to contact police, government officials
and civic organizations were unsuccessful.
   The station said the soldiers opened fire on the youths without
warning. Radio Soleil said four the 10 victims were identified, but
said the military did not permit the bodies of the others to be
examined.
   Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy seized power in Haiti on June 19 after a
coup that ousted civilian President Leslie Manigat, who was in
office for four months. Namphy suspended Haiti's constitution on
July 8.

   An electrical short in an ABC-TV unit brought
fire trucks racing to the Louisiana Superdome three hours before
President Ronald Reagan was scheduled to speak Monday night to the
Republican National Convention on Monday.
   Fire officials said they sent extra trucks to the ABC-TV shed in
a parking lot outside the Superdome because of the magnitude of the
night's events.
   ``There was absolutely no fire,'' said Capt. Terry Tullier of
the New Orleans Fire Department.
   Tullier said normally two units would have responded to the
call, but because the president was involved, three pumpers, two
ladder units, and two district chiefs were sent to the Superdome.
   Bruce Fischhertz, an electrician working at the Superdome, said
the short caused no problems at ABC.

   Here are excerpts from the prepared text of
the speech by President Reagan to the Republican National
Convention on Monday night.
   Nancy and I are so honored to be your guest tonight _ to share a
little of your special time. And we thank you. ...
   ... Eight years ago, we gathered in Detroit in a troubled time
for our beloved country. ...
   That year, it was our dream that together we would rescue
America and make a New Beginning _ to create anew that shining city
on a hill. ...
   It was a dream of again making our nation strong enough to
preserve world peace and freedom and to recapture our national
destiny. ...
   And on the night of July l7, 1980, we left with a mutual pledge
to conduct a national crusade to make America great again. ...
   And my fellow citizens, while our triumph is not yet complete,
the road has been glorious, indeed. ...
   Before we came to Washington, Americans had just suffered the
two worst back-to-back years of inflation in 60 years. Those are
the facts. ...
   And as John Adams said: ``Facts are stubborn things. . . .''
   ... When they sat around the kitchen table, it was not to plan
summer vacations, it was to plan economic survival. ...
   When we met in Detroit in that summer of 1980 _ it was a summer
of discontent for America around the world. Our national defense
had been so weakened, the Soviet Union had begun to engage in
reckless aggression. ...
   ... Our embassy in Pakistan was burned to the ground, and the
one in Iran was stormed and occupied with all Americans taken as
hostages. ...
   We rolled up our sleeves and went to work in January of 1981; we
focused on hope, not despair. ...
   We said something shocking. Taxes ought to be reduced, not
raised. ...
   We rebuilt our armed forces. We liberated Grenada from the
communists and helped return that island to democracy. We struck a
firm blow against Libyan terrorism. We've seen the growth of
democracy in 90 percent of Latin America. The Soviets have begun to
pull out of Afghanistan. The bloody Iran-Iraq war is coming to an
end. For the first time in eight years we have the prospects of
peace in Southwest Africa and the removal of Cuban and other
foreign forces from the region. And in the 2,765 days of our
administration, not one inch of ground has fallen to the communists.
   Today, we have the first treaty in world history to eliminate an
entire class of U.S. and Soviet nuclear missiles. We are working on
the strategic defense initiative to defend ourselves and our allies
against nuclear terror, and American-Soviet relations are the best
they've been since World War II.
   And virtually all this change occurred _ and continues to occur
_ in spite of the resistance of those liberal elites who loudly
proclaim that it's time for a change. ...

<HEAD>Wildfires Continue in West, Hot Weather Partly to Blame</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A lightning-caused forest fire in Montana was threatening homes
Monday, and firefighters at Yellowstone National Park were forced
to close an entrance when smoke from an 80-square-mile blaze
hampered visibility.
   Smaller fires were being fought in Idaho, Oregon and Utah, and
officials said hot, dry weather played a role in most.
   ``We have engines at every homesite or building that is in
danger,'' Lame Deer, Mont., fire information officer Jerry Chapman
said of the 6,000-acre blaze on the northern Cheyenne Indian
Reservation in the southeastern part of the state.
   Six to eight structures were in the fire's path, he said.
Bulldozers and road graders were used to clear debris and crews
burned fire lines around the homes to save them.
   With temperatures in the 90s and winds of 10 mph to 20 mph,
flames shot right up to the yards around two homes on the main road
up the South Fork of Lame Deer Creek.
   Chapman said some residents left their homes temporarily. No
injuries were reported.
   At Yellowstone, spokeswoman Amy Vanderbilt said a road at the
park's west entrance was closed Monday afternoon, although
officials expected it to reopen later in the day. It was the second
road closed Monday.
   Earlier, the road to the Old Faithful Geyser also was closed
because of low visibility caused by smoke from the 52,960-acre.
   High winds pushed the fire toward the park's main roadway Monday
afternoon, Vanderbilt said.
   The hot, dry weather feeding the Yellowstone fires, also fueled
a number of new lightning fires in northwestern and southeastern
Wyoming.
   And in Idaho, high winds and no precipitation prompted Nez Perce
National Forest officials to postpone trying to control the
2,175-acre Ruby Rapids fire on the Main Salmon River.
   Both the Nez Perce and the Payette forests in west-central Idaho
expected another round of dry lightning storms to ignite even more
blazes.
   In the Nez Perce National Forest, about 300 firefighters were
battling nearly 50 blazes, most of them 10 acres or less. Lightning
in the last three days continued to spark fires as officials

   Oregon fire officials contained a 50-acre fire Sunday as a wave

   And in Utah, crews completed fire lines around a 900-acre blaze
on the Ute Indian Reservation.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Rejects Convicted Spy's Appeal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday rejected an
appeal for a retrial by convicted spy Arne Treholt, ending the
former Foreign Ministry official's hopes for a reversal of his
20-year prison sentence.
   Treholt, 45, was sentenced by a district court in June 1985 to
Norway's maximum prison term. Prosecutors charged he had been
handing over Norway's secrets to Soviet and Iraqi agents since 1974.
   Treholt was arrested Jan. 20, 1984 when he was about to leave
Oslo's airport with classified documents, which the court said were
intended for his Soviet contacts.
   Police claimed last year they had uncovered a plan by Treholt to
escape to Africa with a girlfriend.
   Treholt's appeal was based on arguments that evidence was
misinterpreted, a police witness withheld important information and
there were technical mistakes during his trial.
   An appeal last year to the district court that sentenced him was
turned down and the one to the Supreme Court was his last legal
option.

   A man wielding a machete attacked a woman pushing
her 18-month-old daughter in a stroller Monday in southeast London,
hacking the child to death and wounding the mother, police said.
   Scotland Yard said Monday it was questioning a 45-year-old man
in connection with the girl's death.
   The mother was treated at a hospital for head wounds, police
said. Their names were not released.
   A police spokeswoman said the woman was pushing her daughter in
a stroller along the balcony of their apartment when a man wielding
a 2-foot-long machete attacked them.
   The wounded mother fled screaming for help, said the
spokeswoman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom.
   ``The man then attacked the child who received fatal injuries,''
she said.
   Neighbor Julian Manning, 21, said he heard shouting and
screaming just after noon.
   ``I went outside and there was a woman running down the stairs
screaming,'' he said. ``The woman was hysterical and was screaming,
`My child, my child _ he has got my child!' The woman had blood
dripping from her hand and from her clothing.
   ``We could see the man the whole time. He was shouting, swearing
and laughing.''
   Manning said by the time police arrived, more than 30 people
were watching the killer, too frightened to approach him in case he
attacked again.

   Arizona Sen. John McCain, recalling his
captivity in North Vietnam, depicted Michael Dukakis as weak on
defense issues Monday and compared the Democratic nominee to former
President Jimmy Carter.
   ``In this presidential race, George Bush alone has the
experience and knowledge to continue the policy of a strong
defense, coupled with a willingness to negotiate,'' McCain told the
Republican National Convention.
   ``Michael Dukakis, like Jimmy Carter before him, clearly doesn't
understand that,'' McCain said.
   ``Michael Dukakis seems to believe that the Trident
(submarine-based nuclear missile) is a chewing gum, that the B-1
(bomber) is a vitamin pill, and that the Midgetman (land-based
nuclear missile) is anyone shorter than he is,'' McCain said.
   McCain spoke to the convention on its opening night as delegates
eagerly awaited the address of President Reagan, who was delivering
something of a farewell to his party as well as a strong
endorsement of Bush's candidacy.
   Reagan watched McCain's speech from his seat in the Superdome
convention hall, and with the delegates watched a brief film about
McCain's ordeal during the Vietnam War.
   The delegates gave McCain a standing ovation _ the first of the
convention _ after his account of five and a half years as prisoner
of war in North Vietnam.
   McCain recalled those days of captivity as he denounced Dukakis
for his veto as governor of Massachusetts of legislation requiring
the pledge of allegiance to be spoken in the state's public
schools. Dukakis contended the legislation was unconstitutional.
   ``It is outrageous,'' McCain said of that action.
   McCain described the beating administered to a fellow prisoner
at the hands of North Vietnamese captors after they discovered a
hand-sewn American flag they had used to secretly pledge their
allegiance to.
   ``We must never forget those thousands of Americans who, with
their courage, with their sacrifice, and with their lives, made
those words live for all of us,'' McCain said. ``Ronald Reagan and
George Bush remember. They have made America strong, free,
prosperous, and have brought peace to our time.''
   McCain also blasted Dukakis for opposing the bombing strike on
Libya, for his reluctance to support the rescue invasion of
Grenada, and for opposing U.S. military action in the Persian Gulf.

<HEAD>Kemp Says Bush Would Fulfill Reagan's `Powerful Legacy'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Jack Kemp, addressing the convention he had
hoped would be nominating him, compared Ronald Reagan to Abraham
Lincoln on Monday and said George Bush would fulfill the
president's ``powerful legacy.''
   With his hopes still alive for becoming Bush's running mate,
Kemp praised the Reagan record and urged the Republican Party to
reach out to blacks, Hispanics and other minorities.
   ``As the party of Lincoln _ and Reagan _ we believe that freedom
and hope and opportunity can't be for just some of us,'' Kemp said.
   ``They've got to be for all of us. America has got to keep
moving ahead, and we can't leave anyone behind,'' the New York
congressman said.
   Kemp, whose bid for the Republican presidential nomination
fizzled in the early primaries, took the platform at the Republican
National Convention shortly before Reagan was delivering his
farewell to his party.
   Reagan and his wife, Nancy, watched from their seats in the
Superdome convention hall as Kemp spoke for 18 minutes.
   Kemp, a favorite of many in the party's right wing, was greeted
by red signs bearing his name and the words ``I Back Jack.''
   Kemp was the object of an intense campaign by conservatives, who
consider him Reagan's ideological heir, pressing for Bush to select
Kemp as his vice presidential nominee.
   Kemp and two other prominent Republicans, former Transportation
Secretary Elizabeth Dole and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, took the
podium on the opening night of the convention to describe for
delegates the Reagan successes.
   ``Abraham Lincoln, the founder of our Republican Party, gave
this nation a new birth of freedom. Ronald Reagan has helped give
the whole world a new birth of freedom,'' Kemp said.
   ``Nations around the world are following our example, choosing
lower tax rates, less government and more freedom,'' said Kemp, a
leading advocate of the income tax cut Reagan pushed through
Congress in his first term.
   Speaking to the president, Kemp said Reagan had ``brought us to
the threshold of a new era _ in fact, you've brought us over the
threshold.''
   ``You've shown us that we can do more than contain our
adversaries _ we can transcend them,'' Kemp said.
   He said Reagan's support for the Strategic Defense Initiative,
the ``Star Wars'' nuclear defense system, has ``shown us how we can
make even the threat of nuclear war obsolete.'' And he credited
Reagan with leading ``an entrepreneurial renaissance'' that has
``electrified the world and raised our standard of living'' while
creating 17 million jobs in five years.
   ``Mr. President, it's a powerful legacy that you are handing us
here in New Orleans,'' Kemp said. ``I just want you and Nancy to
know that, under the able leadership of George Bush, this party is
going to take it and run with it. And we're going to win in
November.''

<HEAD>Common Market Has Diplomatic Relations with Some Soviet Bloc
Nations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community has
established diplomatic relations with some nations in its Soviet
bloc counterpart, COMECON, the West German government announced
Monday.
   Communist East Germany's state-run ADN news agency also reported
the development.
   Both the EEC, also known as the European Common Market, and
COMECOM are basically economic and trading blocs.
   ADN quoted East German Foreign Ministry spokesman Wolfgang Meyer
as saying the development contributes to the creation of a ``common
European house.''
   That phrase has been used in recent weeks by communist leaders
calling for closer links between Eastern and Western Europe.
   West German government spokesman Herbert Schmuelling released a
statement in Bonn saying, ``The European Economic Community (EEC)
has established official relations with East Germany as well as
with other member states of COMECON.''
   A West German government official said Monday night that at
least four of the 11 COMECON countries had established formal ties
with the EEC and others were expected to follow.
   The official, speaking on condition he not be identified,
identified the four as the Soviet Union, East Germany,
Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria.
   The other COMECON members are Hungary, Poland, Romania, Albania,
Mongolia, Cuba and Vietnam.
   Schmuelling's statement said the ``establishing of missions in
Brussels (the headquarters of the EEC) by COMECON member nations
can ease economic cooperation'' between the two blocs.
   Two months ago, COMECON, which stands for the Council for Mutual
Economic Assistance, and the EEC paved the way to establish formal
ties by signing documents of mutual recognition.
   Talks between the EEC and COMECON on establishing links began in
September 1986.

<HEAD>U.S. Officer Negligent In Accidental Bombing Of Ship, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Maritime Safety Agency said Monday it suspects
a U.S. Navy airman was negligent in the 1987 accidental bombing of
a Malaysian-registered ship in which a crew member was seriously
injured.
   An official said the agency, Japan's coast guard, sent a report
of its investigation Monday to Japanese public prosecutors.
   The report said Lt. Michael J. Foster was taking part in air
exercises off Okinawa on July 27, 1987, that involved dropping
non-explosive practice bombs on a target, the official said.
   Bombs from his airplane twice hit the 5,922-ton Malaysian ship
Pomex-Saga, badly injuring the arm of a Filipino crewman, the
agency official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Foster mistook the ship for his intended target and neglected to
confirm its identity with radar, he quoted the report as saying.
   Under the U.S.-Japan Status of Forces Agreement, Japan cannot
prosecute members of the U.S. military who violate Japanese laws
while on duty, and Foster has not been indicted, the official said.
   The official said U.S. military officials, who have jurisdiction
in the case, had not yet confirmed the report's findings.
   On Monday, the U.S. military paid $10,000 in partial
compensation to the injured crewman, identified as Arturo Roca,
Kyodo News Service reported.
   Foster's home town was not immediately available, and attempts
to contact U.S. military officals for comment Monday night proved
unavailing.

   State House and Senate negotiators
reported reaching a compromise Monday on a county government
reorganization bill inspired in part by an FBI corruption
investigation in which 56 county supervisors were charged.
   After doubts earlier in the day on whether differences could be
settled between versions the two chambers approved in a special
legislative session, chief Senate negotiator Ollie Mohamed said an
agreement was reached. He said it would be brought before the full
House and Senate for approval Tuesday.
   ``I did not want to be held responsible, as I was held
responsible last May, that the Senate killed the bill,'' he said.
   The plan to restructure county government stemmed from an FBI
investigation of corrupt county purchasing practices that led to
federal charges ranging from mail fraud to extortion against 56
supervisors in 25 counties.
   Gov. Ray Mabus called the special session to consider
instituting countywide administration in place of Mississippi's
unique system in which most counties are split into districts in
which locally elected supervisors govern decisions such as
purchasing and road maintenance.
   Mohamed said his conferees had backed off a Senate provision
that would have required counties to purchase at least 10 percent
of equipment, supplies and services from businesses owned by
minorities and women.
   He said House conferees had accepted a provision granting ``home
rule'' to counties, but senators had allowed to be stricken
language prohibiting them from entering collective bargaining
agreements.
   Under home rule, counties would be allowed to take actions not
specifically prohibited by law. Under current statutes, they may
take only those actions expressly permitted. Cities were granted
home rule in 1985.
   Mohamed said negotiators had accepted the House language on the
wording of a referendum for voters to decide if their counties
would maintain roads on a countywide or district basis. He said
they had ``split'' on Senate language that would have exempted from
the referendum requirement those counties that were in
``substantial compliance'' with provisions of the bill on Oct. 1.
   The House and Senate agreed that a county supervisor could not
serve as county administrator, road manager, purchasing clerk,
receiving clerk or inventory clerk.
   Of the 56 supervisors charged, 42 have pleaded guilty, six have
been convicted, one has been acquitted, one died before going to
trial, one died after sentencing, and another was declared mentally
incompetent to stand trial. The remaining ones still have charges
pending.

   Republican presidential nominee-to-be George
Bush will have made his decision on a running mate by the time he
arrives in the Republican convention city Tuesday, a top campaign
aide hinted Monday night.
   Rich Bond, Bush deputy campaign manager, told a reporter on the
convention floor that he expected Bush would acknowledge he had
made his choice, but would not disclose the identity.
   ``If you asked the question, I think that's not an unlikely
thing for him to say,'' said Bond.
   Campaign manager Lee Atwater talked with Bush from a telephone
in the Texas delegation and said he was told the announcement of
the running mate was ``set for Thursday, but it's flexible.''
   While the Bush campaign has scheduled a news conference for
Thursday morning, there have been persistent rumors that making the
announcement on Wednesday, perhaps through a joint appearance at
the convention hall, was under discussion.
   The last word directly from Bush came on Monday morning and he
said that he had not made up his mind.
   Meanwhile, potential Republican vice presidents made a whirlwind
round of appearances in this convention city, some openly touting
their qualifications, others playing coy.
   One prospect, Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas,
complained that the selection process was dragging on too long. ``I
don't care for it, frankly,'' said Dole when asked if felt the
process was demeaning.
   Dole, who had urged Bush to make his selection right after the
Democratic convention in July, said he felt the Republicans were
giving the Democratic ticket ``a five-week head start.''
   Not far from the Superdome, where the convention opened with a
prenoon session, Rep. Jack Kemp told a news conference, ``I would
be a terrific campaigner and a terrific candidate and a terrific
vice president.''
   The rumor mill worked nonstop, trickling out new names. The
latest to surface were two Missouri senators, John Danforth and
Christopher Bond.
   Convention manager Fred Malek told a news conference that speech
writers would soon begin work on ``a generic kind of acceptance
speech'' to serve as a base for whomever is chosen for the vice
presidential nomination.
   In addition, Malek said the writers also would draft nominating
speeches that would require filling in the blanks with the right
name and background.
   Roger Ailes, Bush's media adviser, was taping one-on-one
interviews with prospective choices. In the interviews, potential
choices were asked such questions as why they thought Bush would
make a good president.
   It was believed that the interviews would be used for television
commercials.
   While most prospects were less bullish than Kemp on their
qualifications, they made it clear they would love to be tapped for
the No. 2 spot on the ticket.
   Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico described himself as ``an
extreme long-shot'' in the veep sweepstakes. But he also suggested
that as Bush's running mate ``I could help on the economy, I could
help on the immigrant vote.'' The senator's parents were Italian
immigrants.
   The Dole family _ the Kansas senator and his wife, former
Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole _ appeared at a series of
receptions.
   ``We finally had to leave Washington to come down here,''
quipped the senator ``so we got a recording on the machine at home,
just in case they got the wrong number. It just says, `I accept.'''
   ``If George Bush thinks I can offer the most to the ticket ...
Dan Quayle will sign up immediately,'' said the Indiana senator.
   ``You really can't campaign for the office of vice president,''
said Quayle, as he arrived for an appearance before the Ohio
delegation. ``I'm here because George Bush knows who I am. He
decided to put me on a list.''
   Former White House staff chief Howard Baker of Tennessee
professed to be mystified by the mention of his name.
   ``My name's not on that list,'' he said. ``I've made it
perfectly clear, I've no desire to be vice president.''
   In Washington, the man with the list and the power of decision,
said, ``I have not decided.''
   ``I probably will say when I have decided,'' Bush said on the
ABC program, ``Good Morning America.''
   Bush spokeswoman Sheila Tate said, ``He's going to call the
schedule the way he sees fit. He knows that pretty well, building a
lot of suspense. He knows when he's going to make up his mind. He's
just not telling us.''
   The vice president was flying to the convention city Tuesday,
and most speculation was that he would make his decision before
arriving in New Orleans.
   Campaign manager Lee Atwater said he thought that going into the
weekend Bush ``had received the input he wanted'' on the field of
potential running mates.
   The list of prospects appeared to include the Doles, Kemp,
Quayle, Domenici, Baker, Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, and Attorney
General Richard Thornburgh, a former governor of Pennsylvania.
   Thornburgh said he was at the convention only to hear President
Reagan's Monday night speech and would return to the Justice
Department on Tuesday.
   Thornburgh ducked a question about how he would respond to an
offer of the vice presidential nomination.
   ``I have no reason to think that's going to happen,'' he said.
   But there also were hints that the list could be larger.
   When Bush was asked on the NBC show ``Today'' whether he had
dropped from his list those prospects, including Simpson, who said
they weren't interested, the vice president replied, ``I wouldn't
say that at all.''
   That statement could reopen speculation about Govs. George
Deukmejian of California and Jim Thompson of Illinois, both of whom
have said they don't want to be considered.
   Gov. Thomas Kean of New Jersey, a close friend of Bush, said he
had talked to the vice president on Saturday and ``I know there are
some people who have not been on those lists who are still in his
mind, so it could be a surprise.''
   Vice presidential activity wasn't limited to the appearances of
potential running mates.
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey of New Hampshire was leading a conservative
effort to persuade Bush to choose someone acceptable to the party's
right wing.
   ``I think my choice will be widely accepted _ when I decide on
who that choice is,'' Bush said on the ``Today'' show.
   Kemp said, ``My conservative friends are going to be happy with
the ticket and the platform.''
   But the opposite end of the GOP spectrum also was finding hope
in the prospects.
   ``It's going to be a tall ticket,'' predicted Rep. Jim Leach of
Iowa, a reference to the 6-foot-7 Simpson. The Wyoming senator,
while generally regarded as a conservative, supports a woman's
right to abortion and is open to a tax increase to deal with the
federal budget deficit, positions that put him more in tune with
moderates such as Leach.

   The handicaps a young golfer encountered on
a course in this central Swedish town Monday were one enormous
moose and what may have been the muddiest swamp in Sweden, the
Swedish news agency TT reported.
   This is the account TT gave:
   After a badly hooked shot, the golfer went looking for the ball
among trees lining the fairway and found himself face-to-face with
a huge moose.
   Frightened, he ran deeper into the forest to escape the animal,
and promptly got stuck knee-high in a muddy swamp.
   Hours later, he was rescued by party of golfers who heard his
cries for help.
   The agency did not give the golfer's name.
   Nor did it say whether a moose and a quagmire were par for that
course.

<HEAD>DeSillers Fails to Turn Over Property</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who allegedly bought a car, jewelry and
clothes with nearly $500,000 donated for her late son's three liver
transplants failed to turn the items over Monday and faces contempt
charges.
   Maria DeSillers also failed to post a $100,000 bond as an
alternative, said Karen Gievers, the court-appointed curator of
Ronnie DeSillers' estate who was supposed to receive the property.
   ``The order clearly has been violated,'' Ms. Gievers said. Ms.
DiSillers' attorney ``has indicated no bond has been posted, and I
have personal knowledge that the property has not been turned over
to me.''
   Ms. Gievers said she would file a contempt order Tuesday with
Dade Circuit Judge Francis Christie, who will then schedule a
hearing.
   Ronnie, 7, died at Pittsburgh Children's Hospital in April 1987
while awaiting his fourth transplant. Contributions, including
$1,000 from President Reagan, had poured in after a small fund
collected by Ronnie's school was reported stolen.
   Ms. DeSillers refuses to pay the hospital about $262,000 in
medical bills because she says her son received improper care, a
charge hospital administrators deny.
   She also has refused to cooperate with authorities and account
for the rest of the money.
   Ms. Gievers believes about $242,000 remains of the nearly
$690,000 donated for the boy's liver transplants.
   At a last-minute hearing before Christie earlier Monday, Ms.
DeSillers sought to put off complying with an order issued last
week that she turn the disputed items over to the court.
   Her attorney told the judge that items in Ms. DeSillers' home
were valued at $4,500, and that bonding companies refused to issue
a $100,000 bond for them.
   But Christie brushed aside the objection and ordered Ms.
DeSillers to turn the items, including a BMW luxury car, over to
Ms. Gievers by 4 p.m., or post the bond.
   Ms. Gievers said Ms. DeSillers never showed up.

   Five Iranian fishermen, rescued by the
U.S. Navy eight days ago from their drifting dinghy in the Gulf of
Oman, were headed home Monday after hopscotch visits to four
American warships.
   U.S. military sources said the five were to be turned over to
Omani authorities at Goat Island in the Strait of Hormuz and then
delivered to Iranian diplomatic officials. The sources spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The five were picked up Aug. 8 by the U.S. missile cruiser
Vincennes and said they had spent eight days adrift after their
fishing boat sank.
   They were without food and their water supply had run out. U.S.
military doctors said they were suffering from exposure,
deyhdration, hypothermia and rashes and probably could not have
survived another 24 hours.
   The Vincennes mistakenly shot down an Iranian civilian jetliner
on July 3 and all 290 persons aboard perished.
   The cruiser rescued the fishermen after lookouts saw the flash
of cigarette lighters and heard voices shouting in the pre-dawn
darkness.
   The Vincennes was ordered on another mission, according to the
U.S. sources, and the five were transferred to the missile cruiser
Texas that subsequently sent them to the frigate Fanning.
   After a week of Navy chow they were shifted to the destroyer
Robison that took them to the Omani base in the Hormuz Strait at
the southern end of the Persian Gulf.

   ABC White House correspondent Sam Donaldson
didn't get far Monday night when he tried to listen in on a
telephone call from George Bush to the Texas delegation.
   ``We're going to eavesdrop on this,'' Donaldson said as he held
his microphone to the phone cradled by Sen. Phil Gramm.
   The Texas senator said in a loud voice, ``Listen, whoever you
choose, George, we're behind you.''
   ``Senator, could you ask the vice president a question?''
Donaldson said. But Gramm passed the phone like a hotcake to Lee
Atwater, Bush's campaign manager.
   ``We're going to sign off, but I'll see you tomorrow when you
get here,'' Atwater said. ``Sam Donaldson's yelling in my ear so
loud I can't even hear.''
   ``Let me talk to the vice president,'' Donaldon said.
   ``Hey, Sam, for once in your life, cool it for a minute,'' said
Atwater, who thrust the phone at Donaldson's ear _ covered by the
reporter's headset _ and then pulled it back.
   ``Well, they pay me to try to do my job,'' said Donaldson.
   As things calmed down, Atwater recounted the conversation,
saying Bush ``still plans to make the announcement on Thursday, but
he wants to reserve a little flexibility.''
   ``You're teasing us ... trying to keep the nation watching,''
said Donaldson.
   ``I'm not teasing you. I'm telling you what he said,'' said
Atwater.
   ``Gentlemen, back to you,'' Donaldson said to the network
anchors watching from ABC's convention booth overhead.
   ``There is the modern, electronic version of the smoke-filled
room,'' commented David Brinkley.

<HEAD>Doctors Urge Chavez to Consider Ending Fast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DELANO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors said Monday farm labor leader
Cesar Chavez was weak and dizzy and should consider ending his
monthlong fast in protest of pesticide use on California table
grapes.
   ``We are extremely concerned about the possibility of
irreversible damage to his health,'' the physicians said in a
prepared statement. ``The longer he continues his water-only fast,
the closer he comes to reaching the point where his life will be in
danger.''
   Chavez said he would consider it, said Dr. Marion Moses.
   Chavez, whose fast was in its 30th day Monday, had not suffered
irreversible damage even though he had lost 30 pounds, 17 percent
of his original 174-pound weight, Moses said.
   But the joint statement signed by Moses, Dr. Fidel Huerta and
Dr. Augusto Ortiz said Chavez was weak and dizzy, has a high uric
acid level, which is dangerous to his internal organs, and is
having increased difficulty maintaining proper fluids.
   Chavez began a water-only fast on July 17 to call attention to
the United Farm Workers' boycott of California table grapes and
claims that workers and consumers are endangered by five pesticides.
   Chavez raised the pesticide issue in 1986 and demanded that
California growers stop using Captan, Dinoseb, methyl bromide,
Parathion and Phosdrin. The union contends tolerance levels of
those chemicals ``were set without toxicity data or any information
concerning their long-term effects on people's health and the
environment.''
   Jim Wells, a pesticide expert with the state Department of Food
and Agriculture, countered that all five chemicals are tightly
controlled.
   Chavez conducted a 25-day fast during the 1968 grape boycott. He
conducted a 24-day fast in 1972 to protest adoption of a
right-to-work law in Arizona.

<HEAD>Moscow Circus Accused of Mistreating Its Performing Bears</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Toronto Humane Society claims the famed
Moscow Circus is mistreating its performing bears by confining them
in small cages and on Monday it threatened court action.
   David Bain, a Humane Society investigator, said the 12 brown
bears are being psychologically mistreated by being held in cages
measuring about 3 feet by 4{ feet.
   He said the society will file a complaint accusing the circus of
cruelty to animals if it doesn't provide larger cages or better
treatment by Wednesday.
   Arthur Fogel, a promoter of the Soviet company's tour that
includes shows in New York City next month, said the bears are
``treated great'' and the Humane Society was misleading the public.
   Fogel, of Concert Productions International, said the bears are
excercised daily and Bain's contention that they are confined up to
16 hours a day ``is totally inaccurate.''
   He said the bears are raised by their Soviet trainers from birth
and are in excellent health. ``I'm glad the trainers can't
understand English,'' he added. ``If they heard what is being said
about their bears they'd be very upset.''
   Bain said the bears' daily training routines, in which they walk
on their front legs and ride bicycles, are not adequate exercise
for the animals, which weigh from about 195 to 300 pounds.
   He said the bears ``are suffering from severe behaviorial
problems'' because of the psychological strain of confinement.
   The circus begins a three-week run Wednesday at the Canadian
National Exhibition in Toronto, with the bears performing once or
twice a day.
   Bain also criticized the circus for its treatment of a pregnant
Siberian tiger shipped to Canada. He said the animal gave birth
during a 15-day sea voyage from the Soviet Union to Montreal.
   Circus manager Ted Thrasher said the tiger was transported by
sea because it would have been traumatized had it been moved by
airplane.
   Bain insisted the tiger should not have been moved at all.
   He said the other animals in the circus appeared to be healthy.

<HEAD>The One Man Who Needed No Introduction Got Several</HEAD>

   ``There was the good news and bad news from
Atlanta. The good news was that Dukakis laid all those cards on the
table. The bad news is they were all face down.''
   Laughter. Applause.
   ``The Democrats asked the wrong question. The question was not
`where's George?' The question is, `who's Mike?'''
   Laughter. Applause.
   This was the introduction to the introduction, or to be more
exact, Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming introducing former Sen. Paul
Laxalt of Nevada, whose job it was to introduce Ronald Reagan.
   And Reagan, of course, was the only person at the Republican
National Convention who needed introduction to no one.
   But political conventions being what they are, Laxalt spent five
minutes welcoming Reagan, who was about to enter the hall.
   ``I don't have to give a ringing political speech,'' said
Laxalt, who was described by Simpson as the president's ``first
friend.''
   ``Nor do I have to speak of his many political accomplishments
and the legacy he leaves,'' said Laxalt. Instead, he spoke of
Reagan the person.
   ``To Ronald Reagan, the Golden Rule is very much alive. ... He
has faithfully stuck to his conservative guns. ... His eternal
optimism is infectious _ if there's a pony in the pile, give him
time and he'll find it every time.''
   Then Reagan entered with his wife and the applause and cheering
from the delegates and visitors lasted exactly the five minutes it
had been scheduled.
   
   Many in the huge Superdome couldn't see the first couple in
person so they watched the entrance via huge screens on three sides
of the hall. It presented a peculiar picture of heads turned in all
directions.
   This was the night for lauding the president who's about to
leave. The praise for the man Republicans hope will be the
president-to-be comes later.
   Jack Kemp, the congressman from New York and former football
star, likened Reagan to the Gipper _ a character that actor Reagan
played in the movie ``Knute Rockne.''
   ``We all remember the famous line about winning one for the
Gipper,'' Kemp said. But, he said he preferred another scene, the
one in which Rockne tells the Gipper he would be given the ball and
he should just run with it.
   ``Ronald Reagan, the Gipper, just looks at him with that smile
of his,'' Kemp recalled, ``and says, `how far, Coach?'''
   Kemp turned toward Reagan, sitting across the hall in a box
decorated with the presidential scene.
   ``Well, Mr. President,'' Kemp said, ``when America gave you the
ball eight years ago, no one could have imagined how far you would
carry it.''
   Later, Reagan also evoked the old movie, with a request for
George Bush.
   ``George,'' said the president, ``go out there and make it one
more for the Gipper.''

   A calculating error by Reagan administration
budget experts cannot be rectified by law and is preventing
Congress from enacting $1.2 billion in additional spending programs
for 1989.
   The over-calculation of the size of next year's deficit was
pointed out to congressional aides in the last few days by the
agency that committed it _ the White House's Office of Management
and Budget.
   OMB officials confirmed this past week that the mistake had been
made, and said they had told congressional staff members about it.
   As the $1.1 trillion federal budget goes, $1.2 billion normally
would barely register a tick.
   But the amount is significant because it means that Congress
will have to squeeze spending for anti-drug programs, the homeless,
the hungry and other popular causes under a $1.8 billion ceiling,
rather than what should be a $3 billion limit.

   U.S. and Soviet scientists, ignoring a
diplomatic gaffe half a world away, are conducting rehearsals for
this week's historic nuclear experiment that will mark a milestone
in the atomic age.
   Wednesday's test blast comes nearly four years after President
Reagan first proposed such a project during a speech to the United
Nations.
   The joint verification experiment is designed to measure each
country's ability to monitor the size of the other's test.
Verification could lead to ratification of treaties limiting the
size of nuclear tests, which were signed in the 1974 and 1976 but
never ratified.
   Scientists from the United States and the Soviet Union will be
measuring the explosive punch of a thermonuclear device encased in
a steel canister buried 2,050 feet beneath a picturesque mesa, 130
miles northwest of Las Vegas.

   Citing the potential of terrorist attack,
members of Congress are putting the Reagan administration on notice
that they will strongly oppose any move to permit sea shipment of
plutonium from Europe to Japan.
   ``Here you have an administration that is supposedly waging a
war on terrorism, but promoting a policy that could make terrorism
easy,'' said Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., a member of the House
Foreign Affairs Committee.
   The issue stems from a recently signed U.S.-Japan nuclear
cooperation treaty that authorizes shipments by air of plutonium
from reprocessing plants in Europe back to Japan, where it will be
used to fuel nuclear power plants.
   The plutonium, which also could be utilized for nuclear weapons,
is controlled by the U.S. government because the nuclear fuel
originated in the United States.
   Proceeding with the air shipments was made contingent upon
development of crash-proof shipping casks, which so far has proven
unachievable.

   College students reduced their drinking more if
their assumptions about alcohol's benefits were challenged than if
they were warned about its dangers, psychologists say.
   ``We're looking at this as an approach to prevention'' of
problem drinking, said researcher Renelle Massey of the University
of South Florida at Tampa.
   Study results support a theory that one reason people drink is
because they think it will make them funny, brave, more sociable,
sexier, more assertive or better in some other way, she said.
   Levels of such ``expectancies'' have been linked to alcohol
consumption in previous studies, she said in an interview Sunday at
the American Psychological Association's annual meeting.

   No one can say that we'll never see the likes
of him again, but Ronald Reagan will be a hard act for any
president to follow.
   The man actually enjoys the job.
   Everything about Reagan shows his pleasure with the best role of
his actor's life. It's in his body language. He bounds onstage for
speeches; he looks interested in the other guy's speech; he laughs
at every punch line. His wave to crowds is never forced. Amiability
is his strong suit.
   Used to taking orders from directors in his earlier career,
Reagan has surrounded himself with aides to whom he delegates much
authority. That enables him to be what he said he would be, a
9-to-5 executive who does not take work home.

   Sometime in the next 48 hours, perhaps as
this newspaper is being delivered to your doorstep, George Bush
will announce with a perfectly straight face that the fog has
cleared and he has lit upon a running mate.
   And then we will wait for an annoucement.
   Mercifully, we will not have to wait long. The tease has to end
this week because the television show ends this week.
   Bush wants the ratings not for his ego, but to increase his
chances of overtaking Michael Dukakis. The Republicans are hoping
for audiences of 20-odd million people each night and they plan to
use the forum to launch a broad attack on the Democratic nominee.
Of course, this contrived drama has some of the supporting players

   While conservative leaders agitate for a
running mate of their persuasion, delegates to the Republican
National Convention are content to leave the choice to George Bush
_ be it man, woman, or ``800-pound gorilla.''
   ``Do you think George Bush is out there looking for an
abortionist liberal who wants to raise taxes?'' asked former
Nebraska state Sen. John DeCamp. He called the thought of limiting
Bush's choices ``the profoundly dumbest'' he'd heard.
   It was Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., who ignited the issue by
suggesting an ideological test for the vice presidential nominee.
Without it, he warned, political conservatives could withhold their
support from the GOP ticket.
   But dozens of delegates interviewed by The Associated Press on
Sunday and Monday broadly rejected that suggestion. While many
expressed their personal favorites, nearly all said they would
support Bush's choice regardless.

   It wasn't too long ago that they were a pack
of bickering rivals, six would-be presidents sniping and squabbling
in public over who could best lead the Republicans to victory in
November.
   George Bush was most often the target of the other five, who
never hesitated to list his shortcomings.
   But all that is forgotten now, as Bob Dole, Jack Kemp, Alexander
Haig Jr., Pete du Pont and Pat Robertson join the Republican
convention this week in singing Bush's praises.
   While Bush is the undisputed star of the GOP unity fest, the
other five are by no means shrinking violets during the week's
activities.
   Two are busily keeping themselves at the front of the vice
presidential sweepstakes; three will be prominently featured in
prime-time slots at the convention; and all five are making the
rounds with delegate speeches, media interviews and receptions in
their honor.
   Each of the former candidates was given a spot to address the
convention hall, du Pont and Haig shortly after the opening gavel
on Monday morning, and Robertson, Kemp and Dole in the prized
prime-time slots at evening sessions.

   Americans had more babies in 1987 than in any
year in nearly a quarter-century, but at the same time the nation
recorded more deaths than any year in history.
   Last year also saw the lowest marriage and divorce rates in over
a decade, according to figures compiled by the government's
National Center for Health Statistics.
   A slight increase in fertility, coupled with the huge number of
women in their prime childbearing years, resulted in an estimated
3,829,000 new arrivals last year, the most since 1964, the center
reported Monday in its preliminary statistical summery for 1987.
   Millions of people born in the post-World War II Baby Boom are
now in their 20s and 30s and, after completing school and launching
careers, have begun families.
   That has led to a sharp increase in the total number of births
in recent years, although the nation's rate of 66.1 births per
1,000 women aged 15 to 44 remains at about half that of the late
1950s, when the Baby Boom was at its peak.

   U.S. industrial production shot up 0.8 percent
in July, the biggest increase in nine months, the government said
Monday in a report which intensified economists' worries about
rising inflationary pressures.
   The Federal Reserve said the large July advance was widespread
throughout U.S. manufacturing industries and also reflected heavy
demand for electricity during the summer heat wave.
   The 0.8 percent July advance was double the 0.4 percent June
increase and marked the 10th consecutive month that industrial
production has risen. It was the largest increase since a 1.1
percent rise last October.
   Many economists had been expecting a strong July increase, given
the fact the Labor Department already had reported that
manufacturing employment rose by 68,000 jobs in July, the largest
increase this year.

   The Federal Reserve, one week after its
dramatic move to boost a key interest rate, is likely to continue
pushing rates higher, many economists predicted Monday on the eve

   These analysts believe that the Fed has decided that higher
rates are necessary to slow an economy where demand pressures are
bumping up against tight labor markets and capacity restraints in
the manufacturing sector.
   ``We are facing the danger of a new wage-price inflationary
spiral and I am looking for further tightening steps based on a
perception by Fed policy-makers that the economy is growing too
strongly,'' said David Jones, senior economist at Aubrey G. Lanston

   Fed policy-makers will convene behind closed doors on Tuesday to

   Many of the devices are disguised as toys, others are so-called

total, which spokesman Charles E. Redman placed at 10 million to 30
million, amounts to one to three for every Afghan.
   ``These mines are strewn throughout the countryside and so it's

   NEAR THE HONDURAN-NICARAGUAN BORDER (AP) _ Most Nicaraguan
rebels have retreated to bases in the Honduran mountains, along

   The exodus began four months ago and leaves no more than 2,000

That's the smallest number since the Contras began their war in
1981.
   Contra officials said more than 8,000 fighters and up to 5,000
civilians were in the tent camps spread over mountain terrain about
220 miles east of Tegucigalpa, capital of Honduras.
   More than 1,000 fighters and civilians arrived Sunday. The
largest single group to date, more than 2,500, was said to be

   A feud between the Security Police and
the governing Social Democratic Party is proving to be an
embarrassment to Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson as he campaigns for
next month's general election.
   In the last week, the government's election worries have been
compounded by an exchange of accusations with the secret police of
mischief-making and political spying.
   The feud between the government and its counterintelligence arm,
known as SAPO, goes back decades.
   But the tension resurfaced after book publisher and former
journalist Ebbe Carlsson launched his own investigation into the
1986 assassination of Prime Minister Olof Palme.
   It became clear the amateur detective, an insider in the
governing party, was investigating SAPO as much as looking for the

   The electromagnetic roar of modern America is
thwarting scientists' efforts to monitor the faint whispers of the
universe, a radio astronomer complained Monday.
   With each start of a car, hum of a computer or clatter of an
automatic garage door, another signal is added to the electronic
garbage polluting the airways and obscuring the heavens from radio
telescopes, noted Marcus Price of the University of New Mexico.
   ``The radio spectrum is a natural resource and as with any
natural resource, it can get polluted,'' Price said in an
interview. ``It's not like air or water pollution because you can't
see it, but it's there.''
   For that reason, he said, astronomers are anxious that
unneccessary uses of radio signals be eliminated. In many cases,
gross radio interference sources could be controlled with the use
of filters or shields that would add only a dollar or two to
manufacturing costs, he said.

<TEXT>
   The heir to Jordan's throne is a prince who
fosters economic reform and political openness for his nation in
the midst of Middle East turmoil.
   ``There has been a continous cry on my part ... for a need to
think seriously of Jordanian perestroika,'' said Prince Hassan,
referring to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's plans to
revitalize Soviet society.
   The 41-year-old younger brother of King Hussein is regarded as
one of the Arab world's most visible intellectuals.
   For two decades, the Oxford-educated prince has guided
development planning in this country of 2.8 million people. He has
overseen remarkable economic growth in a land blessed by education
but nearly barren of natural resources.
   With an economic slump squeezing the region, Hassan has urged
bureaucratic reforms and calls for economic policies aimed at
making the Hashemite desert kingdom a center for services and
technology.
   Hassan sees economic success as a major element of identity for
his 40-year-old country, along with his family's 1,000-year history
as rulers of Mecca.
   He said in an interview with The Associated Press the task of
rebuilding Jordan following the disastrous 1967 war with Israel,
which flooded the country with refugees, was one of ``restating
Jordan's credibility on the basis of merit; that Jordan is a
country that works.''
   He also describes the war as his greatest trauma. Most of his
published works have been devoted to the Palestine problem, urging
a moderate road to Arab-Israeli peace. About half or more of
Jordan's population are Palestinians; most of the remainder are
Bedouin Arabs, like King Hussein and Prince Hassan.
   Jordan's failure in its efforts for Arab-Israeli peace led King
Hussein in early August to renounce responsibility for the
Palestinians on the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
   Hussein's decision is expected to force Jordan to forge a new
identity for itself, one in which Hassan likely would play a role
because of his leadership of the kingdom's economic and research
institutions.
   The prince himself is key to the survival of the last Hashemite
monarchy. His family, descended from Islam's Prophet Mohammed, once
ruled Arabia, Syria and Iraq as well as Jordan. It led the Arabs to
independence from Ottoman Turkey in a World War I alliance with
Britain.
   His patronage of Jordan's intellectual and business communities,
as well as his periodic tours of army installations, are partly
designed to help broaden his base in a country so closely
identified with its ruler that a common cliche says: ``King Hussein
is Jordan and Jordan is King Hussein.''
   Hassan was an Oxford undergraduate in Oriental studies when
Hussein named him crown prince in 1965. He said his Oxford years
were ``definitely the happiest years of my life,'' and an academic
aura still clings to him.
   He described himself as ``a magpie reader,'' sampling a wide
range of subjects.
   But he said Gorbachev's book, ``Perestroika,'' was the most
fascinating thing he had read lately _ along with British
philosopher Bertrand Russell's ``In Praise of Idleness.''
   Short, stocky and athletic, the prince seldom seems idle.
   He spends his spare time practicing Chinese martial arts,
playing squash or polo, and with his family.
   The prince has four children by his Pakistani-born wife,
Princess Tharwat, but none have a direct line to the throne. King
Hussein has decreed that his own third son, Prince Aly, is in line
after Hassan.
   Jordanian television often shows Hassan addressing two or three
seminars or conferences a day in Jordan, or attending international
conferences on development or humanitarian affairs.
   He helped found most of the country's chief think tanks, and
said he enjoys seminars where he can step out of his palace role.
   ``Nobody's going to stand up to a person of authority and
express their views as clearly as they should,'' he said.
   Hassan has repeatedly urged freer debate on domestic policy
issues, occasionally bumping heads with government officials
concerned about criticism.
   The prince said Jordan should ``emphasize our basic renewable
resource, which is creative thought and political will based on an
openness which I think has characterized King Hussein's style.''
   He has also prodded Arabs to develop their own ``centers of
excellence'' and said he was ``somewhat resentful'' of the Western
dominance of Middle Eastern studies.
   ``I think that regional self-reliance in the intellectual field
is the only way of tempering that (Western) naivite, which is
welcome in terms of its innocence but tiresome in terms of its
clumsiness,'' he said.

<HEAD>Sandinistas Attempt to Repair Battered Health Programs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Sandinista government is
attempting to push ahead with ambitious health care programs that
suffered severe setbacks because of seven years of civil war.
   ``We are just beginning to move ahead a bit. But we have a long
way to go,'' Dr. Milton Valdez, deputy health minister, said in an
interview.
   The Sandinistas promised improved health care as part of a
package of social pledges made after they ousted the rightist
Somoza dynasty in July 1979.
   Shortly after coming to power, the Sandinistas set out to build
clinics and install a socialistic medical system.
   ``Our policies were based on health being a right for the people
and an obligation of the state,'' Valdez said.
   But the promises of the leftist government gave way to the
realities of the war started by Contra rebels 1{ years after the
Sandinistas took control. The battles destroyed more than 100 rural
clinics by the end of last year, helped bring back such diseases as
malaria and created combat-related mental problems.
   The situation was further complicated in 1985 when a U.S. trade
embargo cut off many supplies and spare parts for medical equipment.
   Health officials acknowlege that not all of the problems can be
blamed on the war. A lack of hygiene education and basic unsanitary
conditions in the capital as well as the isolated rural farmlands
are blamed for a current epidemic of dengue, an infectious disease
carried by mosquitos.
   During six days in July, the Health Ministry reported, almost
3,000 children were treated for diarrhea, the No. 1 killer of
children in Nicaragua.
   The government recently called on residents in Managua to
clean-up the trash and cut the grass in their neighborhoods.
   Valdez said health programs suffered serious deterioration by
1983 with the loss of clinics and personnel and doctors who fled
the country.
   ``We had constructed a health system for peace. It clashed with
the war,'' Valdez added.
   ``We had malaria under control along the Pacific Coast. But then
we began large troop mobilizations to the mountains, where malaria
still existed, and they brought it back to the cities.''
   Doctors and medical volunteers couldn't get into remote combat
regions or those controlled by the Contras. Barricada
International, a Sandinista publication, said in a recent edition
that 600 students, health workers and teachers had been killed,
wounded or kidnapped while working in war zones.
   Mental problems stemming from combat surfaced.
   ``It's difficult to confront. The ones who spend two years
fighting have the most problems,'' Valdez said.
   ``We have seen an increase in violent deaths _ homicides and
suicides _ and more aggressiveness in general.''
   One woman told a reporter her son returned from almost two years
in combat with serious emotional problems.
   ``He would scream in his sleep that the Contras were coming,''
she said. ``He would become nervous when he was awake.''
   Valdez said mental problems also are found among the numerous
ex-soldiers who suffered losses of limbs in the war.
   ``It's not the actual loss of limb that causes the problems but
the psychological part,'' he said.
   ``The combatants are No. 2 on our priority list. No. 1 are the
children.''
   The Health Ministry this year outlined a three-year plan and
designated 1988 the year ``for defense and protection of children's
lives.''
   Infant mortality, halved since July 1979, stands at 64.5 per
1,000 births. It is the highest in Central America.
   Health workers have been taking advantage of a fragile truce
since March to vaccinate rural children against polio, measles,
diptheria and tuberculosis.
   Valdez said it was too soon to rebuild the lost clinics because
fighting continues and the economy still is suffering.
   Medical care is free but medicine is not, Valdez said. Only
about 10 percent of Nicaragua's doctors work with the state system.
The others are private practitioners.
   Medicines are among a long list of basics that are in need.
Black marketeers make large profits selling medications at outdoor
markets.
   The largest single cause of death to adults up to age 49 last
year was related to the war, Health Ministry statistics indicated.
   The ministry said it has detected only 26 cases of AIDS in
Nicaragua and that only five of those were Nicaraguans.

<HEAD>Salvadoran Leftists Say Time is Ripe to Compete in Elections</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After years of exile and scorn
for the ballot box, El Salvador's leftist political parties allied
with Marxist-led guerrillas are preparing to compete in next year's
presidential election.
   ``Elections here between 1982 and now have been part of a plan
designed principally to counter action of the guerrilla army, part
of a counter-insurgency project,'' said Hector Oqueli, organization
secretary of the National Revolutionary Movement.
   ``It could therefore be argued that we are now lending our
support for that same project, and that we're contradicting
ourselves,'' he said.
   However, Oqueli added, more ``political space has opened up''
since the presidents of El Salvador and four other Central American
countries signed a peace plan Aug. 7, 1987.
   ``We want to take maximum advantage of that political opening,
even though we are certain that doing political work in those
spaces is like swimming in a river full of crocodiles,'' he said in
an interview in his party's San Salvador headquarters.
   The regional plan has not ended guerrilla conflicts in El
Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala, but it has contributed to
broadening the range of political expression in El Salvador and
Nicaragua.
   The National Revolutionary Movement, as part of the Democratic
Revolutionary Front, has been allied since 1981 with the Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front, the guerrilla organization known
as the FMLN that has been fighting the U.S.-backed Salvadoran
government for eight years.
   Leaders of the political front who had left in the early 1980s
because of rampant rightist death squads began returning to El
Salvador in November and are still coming.
   Among them are Guillermo Ungo, Oqueli and Ruben Zamora, general
secretary of the Popular Social Christian Movement.
   Zamora's party is a left-leaning offshoot of the centrist
Christian Democratic Party of President Jose Napoleon Duarte, who
sat on military-civilian juntas in 1980-82 and has governed since
1984. Duarte has cancer and his doctors say it is terminal.
   The Oqueli's Revolutionay Movement, the Social Christians and
the Social Democratic Party have formed the Democratic Convergence.
Oqueli's group announced in July its participation, via the
Convergence, in the presidential election set for March. Although
the electoral front has yet to announce its participation
officially, it is already hard at work launching a campaign.
   Zamora, in an interview with The Associated Press, said the
Convergence's activity ``is generating a political alternative
capable of attracting ample sectors of the population that have
been left without alternative.''
   ``We're also contributing little by little to overcoming
people's fear, because of past repression, of participating in
politics,'' he said.
   The leftists do not harbor illusions of an electoral victory.
   ``We are not taking part strictly for the votes, rather we're
mounting a historical project that transcends election day,'' said
Oqueli.
   The main plank in the leftist platform is a negotiated end to
the war. The government has rejected two such proposals by the
insurgents so far this year.
   ``The country's principal problem is the war,'' Oqueli said.
``If the armed conflict is not resolved, we will not be able to
resolve the economic, social and political problems _ health,
housing, nutrition, employment. So we're telling the Salvadoran
people that a solution to the war is necessary, and for us that
solution is a negotiated political one.''
   Duarte's position is that the guerrillas lay down their arms
before talks can begin, but the rebels say that would be tantamount
to surrender.
   The guerrillas imposed a nationwide transport ban during
legislative and municipal elections in March to underscore their
characterization of them as ``a farce.'' The prospect of watching
their political allies take part in similar elections next year is
thought to be a difficult pill for them to swallow.
   ``The FMLN doesn't have to either approve or disapprove of our
participation,'' said Oqueli. ``They simply must respect it, as we
respect their principal means of struggle.''
   He said political and military revolutionary leaders met in
Managua, Nicaragua, in mid-July to discuss electoral participation.
   ``Our position and our objectives were fully understood (by the
guerrillas.)'' he said.
   The Convergence will go up against an incumbent party shattered
by infighting and deteriorated by the exercise of power during
years of crisis. Duarte's promises of peace and increased
well-being have gone unfulfilled.
   The Republican Nationalist Alliance, the main rightist
opposition, is running on the full head of steam produced by its
victories in March. The party, known as Arena, gained control of
the legislature and two thirds of municipalities nationwide.
   The leftist political front could face its most difficult
dilemma if no candidate in March receives more than 50 percent of
the vote. That would require a second round with the top two
finishers in the running.
   Most observers doubt either the Christian Democrats or Arena
will receive a majority in the first round.
   If the Convergence obtains around 10 percent of the vote, which
is considered feasible, it could decide the outcome by casting its
lot with one of the two major parties.
   Oqueli said he believes abstention would be advisable in a
second round.
   ``If we tie ourselves to the Christian Democrats, and they
continue as they have been, we dirty our future,'' he said. ``And
Arena represents the oligarchic past that brought the country to
where it is now.''

<HEAD>Flattened in War, Dresden Still Struggling to Recapture Past</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DRESDEN, East Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The charred skeletons of a once
magnificent city center still dominate Dresden's patchwork skyline
of hasty postwar renewal and piecemeal restoration.
   City planners acknowledge and many Dresden residents complain
that the pace of restoration has been slowed because East Germany's
capital, East Berlin, has been given priority in rebuilding efforts.
   Dresden, known as the ``German Florence'' before its almost
total destruction in two days of Allied firebombing raids in 1945,
is today a city of stark, often brutal contrasts.
   Viewed from the far end of the old Augustus Bridge over the Elbe
River, the meticulously rebuilt Semper opera house, Roman Catholic
cathedral and Zwinger Gallery stand next to the bombed-out and
scorched ruins of the once majestic Royal Palace.
   Despite initial restoration efforts, the palace's crumbling and
roofless facades remain in large part home for birds and overgrown
vegetation.
   Featureless, Soviet-style housing and commercial blocks erected
after World War II now dominate the city's main thoroughfares and
plazas, interspersed with vast and idle spaces long since cleared
of rubble.
   Most of the city's once fabled Baroque turrets and spires are
gone.
   Nevertheless, city officials are fiercely proud of the
restoration projects undertaken in recent years.
   But they say much work has been slowed because of lack of
resources.
   Many grumbling Dresdeners blame the restoration delays and the
widespread deterioration of many buildings that survived on poor
planning and breakneck efforts to spruce up East Berlin.
   More than 20,000 construction workers were ordered to East
Berlin last year to work on massive building projects as Communist
Party officials strove to compete with West Berlin's glitter during
the city's 750th anniversary celebrations.
   East German officials, in an effort to make East Berlin a
showcase, have diverted building materials and workers to the
capital for years, leaving many provincial cities to struggle to
find the means to restore thousands of crumbling buildings.
   Karl-Heinz Seltmann, an official in Dresden's city
administration responsible for culture, defended the allocation of
resources.
   ``The capital city is the capital city,'' he said.
   Others say the city _ and the nation _ faced an awesome
reconstruction task after World War II.
   ``You have to remember that this city was raised from 15 million
cubic meters of total ruin,'' said Manfred Bachmann, director
general of Dresden's 11 state musuems, referring to the firestorm
that devastated the city Feb. 13-14, 1945.
   The destruction of Dresden in the final days of the war has
prompted debate among military historians about the necessity of
the raids at a time when the Soviet army was already rapidly
advancing into Nazi Germany.
   The city, a communications and rail link, was swollen with
refugees and estimates of the death toll have ranged from 35,000 to
more than 135,000.
   The city and its destruction figured prominently in author Kurt
Vonnegut Jr.'s internationally acclaimed 1969 novel,
``Slaughterhouse Five.''
   Bachmann said the devastation did not break the city's will to
survive.
   ``Dresden residents turned out to help rebuild the Zwinger
Gallery when many of them still had no homes to return to.''
   He added that the city had accomplished much, despite the
subsequent shortages.
   He said city pride and a deep-rooted sense of cultural tradition
has helped Dresden recover much of its reputation as a city once
legendary for its art, architecture and music.
   Most of Dresden's art treasures escaped wartime destruction,
Bachmann said, because they were hidden by the Nazis in more than
50 locations around the state of Saxony. Many were discovered in
poor condition in a damp mine shaft by Soviet troops, Bachmann said.
   ``The Russians preserved them and returned them to us.''
   He said more than 1,240 paintings were returned but about 500
works are still missing, including two Rembrandts.
   The treasures of the Saxon royalty, known as the Gruene
Gewoelbe, also survived the the war intact and are on display at
the state art gallery.
   The collection contains more than 3,000 stunningly crafted works
in gold, silver, ivory, ebony, amber, brass, and bronze. Many are
lavishly decorated with precious stones.
   Bachmann said he hoped shortages that have slowed restoration of
the Royal Palace can be overcome and that work can be completed by
the turn of the century.
   The palace will be the repository of many of the city's art
treasures now in storage because of a lack of gallery space.
   But some of the city's most dramatic restoration achievements
are already in peril because of air pollution.
   Heavily-laden diesel trucks and cars using oil-laced gasoline
roar past Theater Square, belching clouds of exhaust fumes around
the opera and Zwinger Gallery, coating the buildings with a film of
grimy, black soot.
   Emissions from a coal-fired power plant not far away also
threaten the sandstone and granite facades.

<HEAD>Economics and The Law of Gravity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With each month, evidence grows that mass
psychology is playing as important a role in the economy's
performance as more traditional factors, such as interest rates and
inventories.
   Perhaps the clearest manifestation shows up in the widespread
belief that the expansion cannot be sustained much longer, simply
because it is almost 69 months old and is ``due'' to expire.
   The factor shows up in the latest quarterly economic survey by
the National Federation of Independent Business, which found that
small-business optimism lost ground, mainly because fewer companies
expect continued growth.
   ``The longer the recovery goes, the larger the proportion of
economic agents becomes which believes that the expansion cannot be
sustained,'' said Professor William C. Dunkelberg, who regularly
interprets the findings.
   ``Apparently many believe that the law of gravity applies to
economic statistics as well as apples,'' said Dunkelberg, dean of
the graduate business school at Temple University.
   He noted that companies have become ``decidedly less optimistic
about future expansion each July, with 60 percent expecting growth
in 1983 compared to 16 percent in 1988.''
   Nevertheless, he declares in a report released today, ``There is
no sign that the economy is poised to enter a recession.''
   Reviewing detailed responses from 1,834 companies, Dunkelberg
noted that the decline in the survey's small-business optimism
index resulted as much from disbelief about the likelihood of
further growth as from strong negative views.
   In some parts of the country, he said, `businesses just figure
it can't get any better, so no improvement is expected.''
   The survey's small-business optimism index fell to 100.5,
seasonally adjusted, its lowest reading since the fourth quarter of
1986, when it registered 99.5. The base of 100 applies to economic
conditions in 1978.
   Over the past 14 years, the index _ compiled from responses in
10 business categories, including expected business conditions,
changes in earnings, and plans to hire _ has anticipated conditions
six months away.
   Reviewing these categories, Dunkelberg said imbalances that
precede recession, such as rapid inflation, unusually strong
inventory buildup, overly rapid capacity expansion, labor shortages
and rising wages, weren't present.
   Some of the wage stability he attributed to an
internationalization of labor markets, explaining that ``rising
costs and wages in the United States simply provide windows of
opportunity for imports.''
   Moreover, he continued, ``bottlenecks that historically produced
rising prices are now alleviated by imports, which dramatically
moderate price pressures. Worldwide, there are few if any
identifiable capacity problems.''
   In another reference to expectations affecting the economy's
direction, Dunkelberg commented on the widespread feeling that a
recent rise in the Federal Reserve discount rate will slow the
economy and prevent inflation.
   ``If this occurs, it will be due to the psychological effects of
the change and not the real impact of rising rates,'' he said.
   He explained that higher rates primarily will affect housing,
but won't impact manufacturing. ``Only if higher interest rates
produce a stronger dollar will demand in this sector be dampened,''
he said.
   Thus, he said, ``there is more hope than substance to the latest
Fed move. But if everyone believes it is the correct policy, it is
more likely that this will turn out to be the case.''

<HEAD>Back to School Trauma Looms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For millions of youngsters one of life's great
experiences _ and great traumas _ is about to occur: The first day
of school.
   This milestone adventure into foreign territory sets the stage
for many years of schooling to come, and calm preparation by mom
and dad can help ease the strain, federal educators report.
   The government has put together a little booklet entitled
``Plain Talk About When Your Child Starts School,'' which is
available at no charge. Write the Consumer Information Center,
Pueblo, Colo., 81009 and ask for booklet 505T.
   You'll also get a catalog including a list of several other
booklets with information on helping kids cope with school. These
are available free or at low cost.
   In the meantime, though, educators stress the importance of
preparing a first-time student for school in advance.
   But, they add, ``don't make a federal case out of it.''
   Children should be informed ahead of time that they will be
starting school, but don't make it a topic of daily conversation
during the summer. Treat starting school as part of the normal
course of life, something everyone does, including your youngster.
   Children will likely have questions about school, and educators
urge answering them honestly.
   Especially important are letting the child know how many days
school will last, how many hours per day, how they will get back
and forth to school, what they will do after school and so forth.
Explain patiently.
   Older children seem to enjoy frightening younger ones, so be
aware that this can happen. Take the older child aside and explain
their responsibility to help the younger one attend school without
fear.
   Educators stress that it is important not to give the impression
that there is any choice about going to school.
   It is normal for children to say things like ``I'm not going''
or ``they can't make me go.''
   Remain calm and be reassuring, but explain that all children
must go to school. Don't argue or waiver, just be matter-of-fact
and calm about school.
   It does help to give the child some control about things, such
as asking if they want to wear sneakers or shoes, and what fruit or
other desert they would like packed in their lunch. That can help
communicate to the child that you appreciate the effort they are
making to do what is being asked, say educators.
   Also, the departure of a child to school creates extra free time
for many parents, time they may enjoy having. Don't tell the child
how much fun you'll be having when they are away.
   While the first few days of school are unique, try to develop a
routine at home to make the event seem relatively normal. Starting
school may be special, but it isn't on a par with Lindbergh's first
solo across the Atlantic.
   All the best planning and preparation notwithstanding, when the
final moment comes the child may balk.
   If this happens, educators say, fight back the annoyance and
send the child to school.
   If tears flow it is usually at the moment of separation. After
that, things usually settle down. Many a parent has spent a
miserable day worrying about a child who quickly recovered and
spent a fine first day at school.
   Fearful behavior will usually disappear within a few days, when
the child begins to feel comfortable away from home, has learned to
trust the teacher and makes some new friends.
   And mastery of the new situation can be an important success for
the child, who is helped to feel better about himself or herself
and more secure in the world.

<HEAD>Small Mexican Town Still Source of Illegal Aliens in United States</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAM ROSSIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTA MARIA DEL ORO, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the new U.S. immigration
law went into effect last year, this town in Durango cattle country
500 miles south of El Paso, Texas, feared for its future.
   For nearly half a century, it had supplied Mexicans who worked
legally or illegally in the United States and sent home the dollars
that helped keep the town going.
   But the catastrophe Santa Maria del Oro braced for 14 months ago
hasn't happened.
   Thousands of dollars still pour in every day, in money orders
sent by residents' relatives working, most of them illegally, in
the United States.
   Mayor Epifanio Carreon had feared the flow of dollars would dry
up and, worse, hundreds of young men would come home looking for
jobs that don't exist.
   ``We would have seen at least some economic affects of the law
by now, but everything is totally normal,'' Carreon says now.
   ``The dollar continues being the most important source of income
in this region,'' said Roberto Acosta, assistant manager of Banco
Internacional, the only bank in the area people that cashes dollar
checks.
   ``Some people returned because of fear before they knew what was
going to happen with the law. But now things are back to normal.''
   One young man in town said, however, he's waiting to see what
happens with the law _ the U.S. Immigration Control and Reform Act
_ before he attempts his first crossing.
   ``If it weren't for the law I'd already be in Los Angeles,''
said Rocky Rocha, 18, who just graduated from a technical school
here.
   He said two of his brothers already there had applied for
amnesty under the U.S. law and fear they'll lose out if they harbor
him as an illegal alien.
   ``If my brothers will let me, I'll go in spite of the law,''
said Rocha. ``Here you work so hard and you don't make much.''
   Santa Maria del Oro has supplied the U.S. labor market with a
steady stream of workers since World War II.
   Many residents went to the United States as farm workers under
the U.S. bracero program of 1942, said Mayor Carreon. By now, some
have gained U.S. citizenship or legal residency.
   By the time the program was dropped in 1964, many local
residents had grown accustomed to having a steady job and earning
dollars.
   Besides, said Carreon, the local gold and mining operations were
winding down and there wasn't much left to do here but work in the
fields or raise cattle. The only major employer around these days
is a lumber company, which has about 300 workers.
   Miguel Angel Salinas, the municipal clerk, estimates that more
than 30 percent of the town's 14,000 people still go back and forth
to jobs in the United States.
   Authorities estimate the percentage of people on surrounding
farms and ranches with relatives working in the United States is as
high or even higher.
   Carreon said the steady flow of dollars _ as much as $60,000 a
week _ has helped Santa Maria del Oro weather Mexico's 6-year-old
economic crisis.
   Indeed, by Mexican standards Santa Maria del Oro is well off.
   The main streets are filled with late-model U.S. and Mexican
pickup trucks, many bearing U.S. license plates. There are no
beggars on the streets. Many of the homes and businesses were
financed with dollars.
   Residents and public officials here say the law has helped those
who hve been in the United States for a long time and wanted to
stay there.
   Manuel Sanchez returned several years ago and bought a butcher
shop with the money he earned as an undocumented worker in Chicago.
   His brother, a Chicago butcher, stayed and has applied for
amnesty, the provision of the law allowing foreigners who meet
certain requirements to seek legal residency.
   ``He feels a lot safer knowing that when he leaves the house (in
Chicago) he'll return,'' Sanchez said.
   Illegal aliens caught in the United States most often are
deported immediately.
   For others who didn't qualify for amnesty under the law or just
didn't bother to apply, it's business as usual: a sundown trek
across the border.
   ``We'll stay as long as there's work. When there's not we'll
come back crying,'' said Jesus Chavez, 29, who has worked in the
United States as an undocumented worker for a decade.
   ``Right now the work is there waiting for us,'' said Chavez, one
of three brothers working without documents at a California
construction company.
   Chavez, home on vacation, said the $21 an hour he earns makes
the risk of crossing as an illegal alien worthwhile.
   Similar work in Mexico probably would pay him about $12 a day.
   ``Right now it (the law) hasn't affected us at all,'' said Luis
Chavez, Jesus' 18-year-old brother who began working illegally in
the United States when he was 14.
   The toughest provision of the U.S. law went into effect this
past June 1, making it illegal for most employers to knowingly hire
undocumented workers. The law calls for stiff fines and even jail
sentences for violators.
   Agricultural workers now in the United States have been given an
extension to Dec. 1 to get their papers in order or leave.
   Although crossing the border without legal documents is the
risky part, those who've worked in the same job in the United
States since before 1982 don't have to show employers their
documents.

<HEAD>Bruce Lee's Successor Refuses to Be Another Rambo</HEAD>

   Jackie Chan, the successor to the legendary
chop and drop king Bruce Lee as Asia's top action film star, has
yet to crack the American market but insists he has more to offer
than Sylvester ``Rambo'' Stallone.
   ``I think I am far better than him _ I dare say it straight to
his face _ because I can do things he can, but he can't do things I
can,'' the baby-faced Chan boasted in a recent interview.
   Chan, 34, is famous throughout Asia for the death-defying stunts
liberally sprinkled throughout his movies, and he pooh-poohs the
``Rambo'' series because Stallone doesn't attempt such exploits.
   ``We see the cave explode and then there he is, appearing on top
of another hill. Really, Rambo,'' he said.
   ``I only do what I really can, something an ordinary man cannot
do but a trained man can. This is me,'' Chan said, proudly tapping
his chest.
   In the 1987 film ``Project A II,'' Chan jumped from a 50-foot
clock tower to the concrete ground through two flimsy canvases. It
was a typical example of his work.
   Such stunts, however, don't come without bruises. In July, he
knocked himself out during a scene in which he somersaulted on top
of a moving bus before smashing through a billboard.
   The combination of stunts and humor in Chan's movies have made
him a smash box-office success in Asia, with his last 10 movies
earning more than $150 million in Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan,
Singapore and Malaysia.
   At the same time, Jackie-mania is ever present. When he appeared
for a promotion in Tokyo in March, 800 fans turned up, and he
topped a list of idols in a survey of Taiwan teen-agers released in
February.
   In 1987, a Japanese woman moved to Hong Kong to serve him tea in
his studio every day. Chan made her his floor manager, a move that
drove dozens more Japanese women to fly to the British colony.
   Another woman, 24-year-old Reiko Mimura, moved here from Tokyo
in 1984 to be closer to her idol. ``I just looked at him and felt
very nervous. He was nice and gave me his records with his
autograph,'' she recalled of a meeting two years ago.
   Chan, a muscular 5-foot-10, said he does not dare have a lover
or a wife for fear of driving his fans to despair. Two girls
reportedly tried to kill themselves over the actor.
   But despite his wild popularity in Asia, his efforts to impress
U.S. moviegoers have been disappointing. He has appeared in five
American movies, including ``Battle Creek Brawl'' and ``The
Cannonball Run.''
   Chan was not happy with the movies, and said he would like to do
a film with Steven Spielberg _ free of charge if necessary.
   ``I need an opportunity _ a great director who wants to make a
movie about Chinese people to hire me,'' Chan said. ``The audience
will want to see any film by that director, and when they happen to
see me in the movie they'll say, `Hey, this Jackie is cool.'''
   With no offers from Spielberg, however, Chan plans to star in a
self-directed movie in the United States next year. ``If the
Americans like it, OK. If not, forget it,'' he said.
   Chan was born in Hong Kong in 1954 to parents who emigrated to
Australia six years later. They enrolled Chan in the Chinese Opera
Research Institute to study acting, acrobatics and martial arts. He
appeared in a few films before leaving the institute to work as a
stuntman.
   After kung fu star Bruce Lee's death in 1974, director Lo Wei
picked Chan as a new talent. Chan's career was launched in the 1976
film ``New Fist of Fury'' in which he imitated Lee. More than 10
similar films quickly followed, but not until the 1978 ``Drunken
Monkey in a Tiger's Eye'' did Chan find his own style of
action-comedy.
   In 1985, Chan cracked his skull in Yugoslavia while shooting a
scene in which he was to leap from a castle onto a tree. Instead,
he fell 50 feet to the ground, fracturing his skull and driving a
splinter into his brain. Chan underwent brain surgery and hearing
in his right ear remains impaired.
   ``I never thought it would happen to me,'' he said. ``While I
was lying in the hospital I thought a lot and found there are many
things I have not done.'' The accident was a turning point in his
life. When he returned to Hong Kong, he set up a charity
foundation, participated in anti-drug campaigns and ran marathons
for charity.
   ``Now I think more positively,'' he said. ``If I want to do
something, I'll do it quickly. It's not that I'm afraid I may not
live through tomorrow, but I don't want to have any regrets.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Biotechnology has begun to do amazing things
with what seems the very stuff of life and evolution, and an
industry to exploit the researchers' successes has taken shape. The
potential seems enormous. So, to some at least, is the risk of
unexpected consequences. That's what a determined crusader has
focused on, to much controversy.

   A scientist sprays genetically altered
bacteria onto a strawberry patch. A mouse with a man-made
predisposition to breast cancer scurries about a university lab. A
pig with a human growth hormone gene grows bigger and faster than
its brother. Many cheer. Others worry.
   For some, genetic manipulation threatens deeply held religious
beliefs. For others, it's the thought of mutant organisms run amok.
For still others, fresh images of disaster _ the orange flames of
Chernobyl, the forked tongue of smoke from the Challenger _ cloud
the promise of bright technological frontiers.
   In courtrooms and congressional hearings, in the media and on
college campuses, the man who speaks most fervently to such
uneasiness is Jeremy Rifkin, biotechnology's leading gadfly. He is
not widely revered among scientists.
   ``In the Industrial Age, our parents didn't ask questions. It
was the age of progress and efficiency, and there were no limits,''
Rifkin says. ``Scientists said `trust us.' Industrialists were
hellbent on change, i.e. profits. Policy leaders were wildly
enthused. There was a utopian mentality.
   ``A child believes there are no consequences for his acts. We've
had a childlike consciousness. Now, with the new scientific
technology, the changes are so impactful we can't afford that
childlike mentality. It's time to raise fundamental questions.''
   He speaks quickly, a rush of words barely audible over the drone
of a copier, the lone concession to electronics in the otherwise
resolutely low-tech office of the Foundation on Economic Trends.
   The outer room, crammed with young interns and old chairs,
resembles the headquarters for an embattled political campaign. In
a sense, it is.
   From this modest command post, a handful of lawyers, policy
researchers and interns fire shots sometimes heard round the
nation. They aim at all manner of targets: Genetic engineering.
Animal patenting. Commercialized childbearing. Bovine growth
hormone. Biological warfare.
   Rifkin, the foundation's president, is 43, a small man trim from
years of swimming a mile every night at the Y. His brown eyes
radiate warmth and good humor; the vision of a civilization bent on
engineering its own demise is a burden that rests on him lightly,
at least outwardly.
   He has no shortage of critics among scientists, who dismiss his
arguments as unscientific and his writing as anti-intellectual.
Opponents stress Rifkin's lack of credentials _ he's had no formal
science training _ and describe him as a nuisance. But a few
concede that, along with their blood pressure, he also raises some
important points.
   His talent lies in bringing prominent people together in
alliances such as the National Coalition Against Surrogacy,
composed of feminists, lawyers and 17 former surrogates including
Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould, to hold news conferences, testify before
Congress, and generally stir up the public.
   Other foundation staffers specialize in lawsuits such as the
1984 action that has delayed construction of a Department of
Defense germ warfare laboratory at the Dugway Proving Ground in
Utah. The Army's considering scaling down the proposed facility or
putting it elsewhere, among other choices.
   They also circulate petitions, such as the June 13 request to
Postmaster General Anthony Frank to halt the Army's longstanding
practice of shipping deadly experimental viruses through the mail.
Frank concurred.
   A 1983 lawsuit by Rifkin's organization stalled tests of a
frost-inhibiting microbe on the West Coast for four years before a
state court of appeals judge finally gave the go-ahead.
   Another suit prompted the federal Environmental Protection
Agency to deny a permit to Monsanto for a test of a gene-altered
microbial corn pesticide. Monsanto eventually abandoned the project.
   Last May, the Defense Department agreed to curtail testing at
electromagnetic pulse simulator facilities in Virginia, Alabama and
New Mexico until environmental, health and safety matters can be
documented. EMPs are electromagnetic pulses that travel at speeds
of light to simulate those generated by high-altitude nuclear
explosions. The agreement came in response to another Rifkin suit
charging potential environmental and human health risks.
   Rifkin's foundation was also instrumental in exposing two
biotech cases involving violations. One concerned a California
company that conducted outdoor tests of a genetically engineered
chemical before receiving a permit. The EPA accused the company,
Advanced Genetic Sciences, of falsifying the data to indicate the
tests had taken place indoors.
   In the other, the Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service, without first consulting other
regulatory agencies, allowed Biologics Corp. of Omaha, Neb., to
test and market a genetically altered vaccine for pigs. The New
York Times in an editorial called the foundation ``an unrelenting
watchdog of genetic engineering'' that ``deserves credit for
bringing to light these two cases and what they show about the
ragged federal system for regulating the new technology.''
   Not all Rifkin campaigns succeed. Two recent suits challenging
government regulation of genetic engineering were dismissed by a
U.S. District judge who ruled it had no legal standing to sue.
   A genetically engineered mouse can still be patented the same as
a mousetrap, although legislation has been introduced in Congress
calling for moratoriums on animal patenting.
   Deliberate environmental releases of various genetically
engineered viruses and bacteria are planned over the next several
years.

   The federal Food and Drug Administration rejected a petition
demanding an environmental impact statement on bovine growth
hormone, charging it ``will damage the environment, cause
unnecessary suffering to cows, and wreak havoc on the dairy
economy.''
   And a proposal for the first authorized human gene transplant is
on the agenda for the fall meeting of the National Institutes of
Health's Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee.
   Nonetheless, Rifkin's influence has been felt, in the boardroom
as well as the courtroom.
   ``Companies don't want to take Jeremy on head-to-head. It's a
losing proposition. Companies don't want to get into emotional
situations. They don't want to be perceived as being in the middle
of a dogfight with Jeremy while they're out there trying to raise
money,'' says Bruce Mackler, general counsel for the 180-member
Association of Biotechnology Companies.
   ``The financial costs must be measured in terms of eroding of
investor confidence. People don't like to invest in industries...in
which there are controversies.''
   Mackler, an immunologist as well as a lawyer, calls Rifkin
``very articulate, very persuasive and very dangerous. He has done
more to delay science, to erode public confidence in science, than
many people.''
   ``If he were at the end of the runway at Kitty Hawk, he'd be
yelling `Don't do it until we develop a parachute! Don't do it
until we know it can fly!'
   Among scientists, Rifkin is regarded as a nuisance, says Dr.
Gerard McGarrity, cell biologist at Coriell Institute for Medical
Research in Camden, N.J., and chairman of the Recombinant DNA
Advisory Committee (RAC). It is the RAC's job to draft safety
guidelines for conducting genetic engineering research and to
decide whether potentially hazardous research should be carried
out. RAC's guidelines are mandatory for government-sponsored
research; private industry has agreed to follow them voluntarily.
   ``When someone opposes every new development, when he takes an
extreme view on every issue, you have to wonder. Sometimes the
person standing on the periphery is a pioneer. But every issue?''
Moreover, McGarrity adds, ``He operates on a very limited
scientific basis.''
   He recalls that Rifkin once opposed a vaccine being developed
against an organism that causes diarrhea. ``He feared it could be
used in biological warfare,'' McGarrity says. ``In fact, we wanted
to use it as a vaccine in developing countries where diarrhea is a
problem for thousands of children.''
   Susan Gottesman, a former RAC member, says that Rifkin ``doesn't
address science at all.'' Gottesman is chief of the Biochemical
Genetics Section of the National Cancer Institute's Lab of
Molecular Biology and a consultant to the federal Environmental
Protection Agency on biotech matters.
   ``He makes absolute statements which sound scary, and he uses
discussion points which are sure to appeal as you hear them,'' says
Gottesman, who has debated Rifkin on television. ``It's hard for
the public to understand the science and the real difference
between something that's scary and something that's not.''
   Those views are echoed by others, who invariably single out
``Algeny,'' one of the nine books Rifkin has written (each in
longhand on yellow legal pads), for their harshest criticism.
   The author, an economics major who has had no formal science
training, describes ``Algeny'' as ``a thoughtful and studied
critique of the philosophy of modern science and technology.''
   A Harvard University biologist, Stephen Jay Gould, called it ``a
cleverly constructed tract of anti-intellectual propaganda
masquerading as scholarship.''
   ``Among books promoted as intellectual statements by important
thinkers, I don't think I have ever read a shoddier work,'' Gould
wrote in 1985. ``Damn shame, too, because the deep issue is
troubling and I do not disagree with Rifkin's basic plea for
respecting the integrity of evolutionary lineages.''
   Rifkin does have a measure of support even among scientists,
however.
   Stuart Newman, a developmental biologist at New York Medical
College and a member of the Boston-based Committee for Responsible
Genetics, acknowledges inaccuracies in Rifkin's writings, but says,
``I see him more as an Old Testament prophet who raises important
issues that go beyond expertise.
   ``I believe technology should be developed and fostered, but
there are other important issues. Society has a stake in making
sure the technologies are used safely and ethically. From that
perspective, I do think Jeremy Rifkin has performed a service by
keeping the issues of appropriate use of biotechnology in the
public eye.''
   Liebe F. Cavalieri of Sloan-Kettering Institute in Rye, N.Y., is
a molecular biologist whose work with DNA dates to the discovery by
Watson and Crick of the double helix 35 years ago. Cavalieri
acknowledges ``soft spots'' in ``Algeny,'' but says scientists who
dismiss his arguments as strictly emotional are ``throwing dust
around.''
   ``Most scientists are trained not to think in broad, global ways
and cannot see the possible outcome of this or that technology in
terms of societal impact. It's very difficult to get out of the
mold of scientist. We're trained in reductionist thinking,'' he
says.
   ``But we have at our disposal methodology which can disrupt
living systems...And I'm afraid we're not being selective.
   ``We're not going to get a plague next week because somebody
released some nitrogen-fixing bacteria,'' Cavalieri adds. ``The
issue is much more subtle, and in a way, more dangerous. The
effects will take place over time.''
   Those subtle, long-term effects are at the heart of Rifkin's
crusade. He's not worried about killer tomatoes. He is worried
about applying engineering principles to living things at the
expense of traditional human values.
   ``It's called genetic engineering because it's about engineering
genes, taking engineering principles and applying them to the
blueprint of every aspect of life,'' he says.

   ``Control, predictability of outcome, reductionism,
utilitarianism and efficiency. Those are the values we have come to
covet as important.
   ``The philosophy of using genetic engineering is to improve a
species. So what criteria do we use to determine what are
functional genes? Who should have that authority? Would you trust
the president? The Congress? The National Academy of Science? Would
you trust GE or the marketplace?
   ``Two value systems are in confrontation: the ancient value of
our sacred relationship to the rest of creation and our desire to
reduce everything to utilitarian standards.''
   These would be tough times for scientists even without Jeremy
Rifkin.
   Long accustomed to working in good faith, researchers
increasingly find themselves assailed by creationists, animal
rights activists and others.
   Close scrutiny by one's colleagues is one thing; surveillance by
a suspicious, scientifically unschooled public is something else.
   A biotechnology symposium at the University of California last
fall gave a glimpse of scientists' mounting frustrations at finding
their experiments hamstrung by what they called ``biological
McCarthyism'' or ``the `tomato-that-ate-Hollywood' syndrome.''
   The symposium came in the wake of field tests of ``ice-minus''
bacteria by researchers from the University of California at
Berkeley and Advanced Genetic Sciences. The test involved the
release of genetically altered microbes. Placed on crops, the
microbes help prevent frost from forming.
   Scientists generally agreed that testing the microbes on
strawberry and potato plants presented no danger. Rifkin and others
feared the microbes could mutate to cause human disease. Lawsuits
and protests followed. Ultimately, vandals tore up plants at both
test sites.
   ``Everybody involved with ice-minus has had such a horrendous
time with the controversy that they're all burned out,'' one
scientist said.
   Some scientists who have reservations about aspects of
biotechnology feel that to say so would be counterproductive.
   ``There aren't many societies that give science the free rein
it's had here,'' biologist Newman says. ``It's a precious thing,
and it relies on good will. Scientists are very reluctant to sour
that.''
   Genetic engineering technology involves manipulating the DNA,
the basic substance of heredity of living organisms. By moving DNA
between different organisms, researchers hope to develop more
productive plants and treat genetic diseases. They also hope to
create new drugs, one application of genetics that Rifkin does not
oppose.
   Newman is among a handful of experts who are beginning to
express scientific as well as ethical doubts about genetic
engineering. He believes the strong drive to commercialize new
techniques of manipulating genetic material has given rise to
distorted views about biotechnology's potential.
   ``The standard view holds that biologists have `cracked the code
of life' and are now poised to `genetically reprogram' damaged or
unsuitable life forms,'' he wrote in a recent issue of Perspectives
in Biology and Medicine.
   ``But the most that can be claimed for DNA on the basis of
present knowledge is that it specifies some of the ingredients that
make up an organism's cells. DNA does not function as a `command
center' or `blueprint' for the functioning of those cells, as has
sometimes been stated...
   ``The concept nonetheless continues to flourish in textbooks, in
the popular media, and in corporate handouts, as a confidently worn
mask that obscures the primitive state of our understanding of the
biological world.''
   The notion of ``genetic programming,'' intended as metaphor, is
now taken literally, Newman says, resulting in serious
misconceptions of the status and potential of biotechnology on the
part of scientists and non-scientists alike.
   ``Since each gene contributes to thousands of traits, and each
trait is the result of the interaction of thousands of genes, all
we can do is make minor modifications and hope for the best.''
   Separating good genes from bad is far more complicated than most
people realize, he adds. The same recessive gene linked to
development of one disease _ sickle cell anemia, for example _ also
protects against another _ malaria.
   Clearly, ``the nature of this material is very different from
what we're used to working with in building and engineering,'' says
Newman. He characterizes current knowledge of the relationship
between an organism's DNA and its overt characteristics as
``meager.''
   To Rifkin, biotechnology is unfolding in a manner all too
reminiscent of other technical and scientific developments that
have suddenly come to exact an unexpected price. He points to a
magazine cover story about the greenhouse effect, the gradual
heating of the planet scientists say will result from the
destruction of the ozone layer in the atmosphere that protects
against the sun's ultraviolet rays.
   ``This is the bill for the industrial age,'' he says,
brandishing the magazine. ``It lasted 200 years and we'll pay for
it for 2,000.
   ``Now we're about to run out of fossil fuels and enter the age
of renewable resources. This is the time to raise the issues _ like
patenting animals. It's as if, 100 years ago, we divided up the oil
and coal, the resources for the industrial age. Now we're dividing
up the resources for the age of biotechnology.
   ``Science and technology initiatives dramatically affect the
future. We can't be passive. The 21st century is being defined now.
We're determined to help shape it before it becomes a fait
accompli.''

   For Jeremy Rifkin, the combat against
biotechnology is the latest in a series of battles that have helped
shape a varied life and career. He's fought tougher.
   He was born weighing 2{ pounds.
   His birth, midway through the sixth month of Vivette Rifkin's
pregnancy, wasn't the only surprise. Mrs. Rifkin was about to be
wheeled out of the delivery room when a doctor detected a second
baby.
   ``Our chances of survival were something like zero,'' says
Rifkin. Other than being smaller than most high school freshmen,
and the occasional schoolyard thrashings that went with it, he
suffered no permanent ill effects.
   Jerelyn Rifkin was less fortunate. An error in regulating the
flow of oxygen to her incubator robbed her of most of her sight.
Now married and a mother of three, she remains legally blind,
although ``she does everything everyone else does,'' says her
brother. ``She's probably the best-adjusted person in my family.''
   Her daughter's handicap inspired Vivette Rifkin to found
Educational Tape Recording for the Blind, a volunteer organization
now in its 20th year of recording textbooks for blind students. At
77, she still works a seven-day week as its president. Milton
Rifkin is retired from his job as a plastic bag manufacturer.
They've lived in the same house for 43 years, in a working-class
neighborhood on the south side of Chicago.
   Growing up with a handicapped twin prompted Rifkin to give a
great deal of thought at an early age to weighty social issues. He
still does.
   ``In this society, the highest compliment is to turn out
generations of productive human beings. You have to have
productivity, of course. But a lot of us grow up believing the
highest value is to be productive, like a machine is productive,''
he says.
   ``That does a disservice. What matters most is to turn out
caring human beings, people who have the higher value of empathy.''
   By the time he graduated from high school, about the time he
finally caught up to his classmates, Rifkin had come to believe
that an ordinary person can accomplish extraordinary things, a
notion reinforced by his acceptance, despite flunking high school
English, to an Ivy League college. Twenty-five years and nine books
later, he says, ``I still can't tell you which is the adverb.''
   As a beer-drinking fraternity man at the University of
Pennsylvania, he was ``very rah-rah, a cheerleader,'' says Neal
Borenstein, his college roommate.
   Rifkin was ``never enthralled with high-tech,'' adds his
roommate. When most college kids were preoccupied with rock music,
Rifkin was busy organizing a nostalgia show of '50s kiddie
programs. Even then, his organizational skills were impressive:
``He filled the auditorium, and the show was a huge success.''
   His politics took a sharp turn to the left in 1966, when a
Vietnamese history course ``didn't square with what they were
saying on TV.''
   The following year, he made waves nationwide as the first senior
class president of an Ivy League college to publicly denounce the
war. After graduation, he attended the Fletcher School of Law and
Diplomacy at Tufts, then became a VISTA volunteer in New York,
working with welfare recipients in Bedford-Stuyvesant and East
Harlem.
   During the '70s, he organized the People's Bicentennial
Commission, ``an alternative to Nixon's Tory celebrations,'' he
says. The commission held rallies for ``economic democracy'' and
churned out classroom materials celebrating the nation's
revolutionary past.
   By 1977, Rifkin had found his next cause in the controversy over
recombinant DNA technology, the subject of his new book, ``Who
Should Play God.'' The same year, he led protesters in disrupting a
National Academy of Sciences meeting on DNA research, chanting ``We
will not be cloned.''
   In the years since, both Rifkin's techniques and his targets
have grown more complex. These days, in addition to campaigns
against animal patenting, biological warfare and surrogacy, another
form of tinkering with life, he's preparing a global boycott of
milk treated with bovine growth hormone, a Greenhouse Effect
Coalition and ``we'd like to move big on electronic pollution.''
   For all his public pronouncements on technology's ills, ``I'm
not a purist,'' Rifkin concedes. He owns a condo, drives a Honda,
and is a faithful viewer of ``thirtysomething'' and ``Cheers.''
   He's clearly proud of the favorable reviews he's receiving for
his college speaking engagements (Yale University called him ``a
rare bird _ a first-rate speaker and a first-rate writer''). At the
same time, no amount of criticism directed at him or his politics
seems to faze him.
   ``I've known him a long time,'' says Ralph Nader, who has lent
support to Rifkin's campaign against animal patenting. ``He's very
determined, very sincere, and he's on the issue for the long run.''
   ``I'm an average person with an average background,'' says
Rifkin, who believes average people are quite capable of changing
history.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Back in 1964, a man running for the White House
could still bring his campaign to the people without a vast
apparatus of hired image-shapers, consultants, security forces _
anxious glances at the latest quickie polls to tell him what to
say. Perhaps one of the last candidates to present himself largely
unencumbered was Barry Goldwater of Arizona. An AP reporter who
covered this and many another run for the White House recalls how
it felt in simpler times.

<TEXT>
   Barry Goldwater's was the last of the freestyle presidential
campaigns, innocent of consultants, short on security men, played
in person instead of on television _ and seldom inhibited by any
real prospect of winning the White House.
   That made it a perfect fit for the senator from Arizona. The
Secret Service would have cramped his style, and he undoubtedly
would have fired the kind of campaign consultants who manage
campaigns these days. In 1964, Goldwater worked with people he knew
and trusted, not hired hands. He said what he thought, which
sometimes changed over the course of a campaign day. He was accused
of shooting from the hip, but he wasn't always that careful.
   For all that, Goldwater's 1964 campaign was candid, generally
honest, short on rancor despite the bitterness of some of his most
ardent supporters, and remarkably prophetic.
   Latter-day legend notwithstanding, Goldwater dug many of his own
political traps before he became a presidential candidate. His
notions about selling TVA and turning Social Security into a
voluntary system are samples: Both proposals were made in pieces he
wrote as Mr. Conservative, not Mr. Candidate. Actually, he tempered
them during the campaign, although he liked to reminisce about the
blunt way he'd talked in St. Petersburg about Social Security and
in Nashville about TVA. He repeated the proposals, but he also said
that he didn't believe in changing contracts like Social Security,
and that, besides, Congress wouldn't let any president make that
system voluntary or sell off TVA.
   It was a simpler time and, too briefly, a safer time. John
Kennedy had been assassinated, an event that deformed the politics
of 1964. But that was an aberration. Secret Service agents were not
deployed around candidates until more than four years later, after
Martin Luther King and Robert F. Kennedy had fallen to assassins.
   Goldwater traveled with Charlie Justice, an automobile dealer
he'd met in a New Hampshire motorcade, as his sole security man
during the presidential primaries. Since 1968, the Secret Service
cocoon has enveloped candidates, limiting access, controlling
crowds, and often keeping voters away in the name of security.
   Not that Goldwater was a glad-hander. He sometimes seemed
annoyed when crowds kept him overtime. One night an unexpected
crowd of supporters turned up to cheer him as his chartered plane
arrived in Atlanta. Goldwater snapped a demand to know who on his
staff was responsible for that.
   ``I'm no baby-kissing, back-slapping, blintzel-eating
politician,'' he said one day in Hanover, N.H. That was intended as
a slap at his arch rival, New York Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, the
Eastern Republican incarnate. Rocky, of course, delighted in being
all of the above. And, like any New York politician, he knew how to
say ``blintz.''
   In Concord, an over-zealous New Hampshire supporter marched
Goldwater into the Puritain Restaurant to shake hands at lunch
time. The senator didn't stay long. ``If somebody walked up to me
while I was eating and stuck out his hand, I'd put a hamburger in
it,'' Goldwater said.
   He was a Westerner who liked guns. Security people do not like
guns around their candidates. One can only speculate at the
reaction had the Secret Service been on hand when Goldwater decided
to fire a few shots across his driveway toward Scottsdale, into a
bullet trap he sometimes missed. He did just that one day after
entertaining a group of reporters at lunch at his home. One of them
liked pistols as much as the senator did, and Goldwater invited him
to join in target practice.
   This proved exciting for the rest of the party, still chatting
with Mrs. Goldwater when the gunfire began, out of the front door,
one room away.
   ``It's just Barry with his pistol,'' said Peggy Goldwater,
thinking to calm her guests. She made him stop shooting. Goldwater
acknowledged it probably was just as well because some of his shots
had strayed into the valley below, and it seemed to bother the
people at the church down there.
   Goldwater also liked airplanes, as pilot and as passenger. His
campaign jet was named ``Yia Bi Kin,'' Navajo for House in the Sky.
It was one of the first of the Boeing 727 jets that now are a
staple of world aviation.
   The senator flew it, although nobody ever admitted that. He also
landed it when he arrived at Dulles Airport near Washington after
the election. He brought it down hard and smiled knowingly when a
reporter told him the third bounce landing was a nice one although
the first had been rather exciting.

<TEXT>
   It was at least that exciting when the Goldwater charter
performed the Bristol Flyby early in the campaign. The 727 took off
from Tri Cities Airport near Bristol, Tenn., and leveled off en
route to Cleveland. Suddenly the plane turned sharply and dove at
high speed. Grown pilots _ and there were a lot in the Goldwater
entourage _ paled. Goldwater, up front, went into the cockpit and
came back smiling. The plane kept diving toward the ground then,
suddenly, leveled off and blazed down the runway at control tower
level. A pilot's prank.
   ``That was to separate the men from the boys,'' Goldwater said.
   Consistency was not a hobgoblin of the Goldwater campaign. One
morning in Laconia, N.H., during the primary campaign, Goldwater
said he would be inclined to withdraw from the United Nations if
Communist China were seated. One stop later he said the United
States must stay in the United Nations. Another stop, and he said
that if the mainland Chinese supplanted the Nationalists, it would
blow U.S. participation to pieces.
   Then, that evening: ``I've never said let's get out of the U.N.
I don't know how that rumor ever got started.''
   At an American Legion convention in Dallas, Goldwater likened
The New York Times to Izvestia. Outside, he chatted with a group of
reporters and took pains to tell Charles Mohr, the Times reporter
who covered his campaign, that it wasn't personal. ``I didn't mean
you, Charlie, I meant them,'' he said.
   Goldwater's partisans despised reporters, particularly Eastern
reporters. A reporter for the San Diego Union arranged for two sets
of press badges. One read ``Eastern Liberal Press.'' The other read
``Western Tory Press.'' The safe course was to grab one of each.
   The Vietnam War was taking shape during 1964 _ the purported
attack on U.S. vessels in the Gulf of Tonkin came in August, after
Goldwater had been nominated.
   Long before that happened, Goldwater warned that Vietnam had the
makings of the long, agonizing conflict it became.
   In an unlikely setting, amid acres of blossoming pear orchards
in Northern California that spring, Goldwater said that Vietnam
could become a far more serious conflict than Korea. He said
President Lyndon B. Johnson should tell the nation of the peril,
and of his plans for the future.
   At that time, U.S. involvement was limited to aid and advisers.
Combat forces came later.
   Still grappling with the Vietnam issue that fall, Goldwater
announced that if elected he would ask former President Dwight D.
Eisenhower to go to South Vietnam and recommend future policy.
   It was an ironic echo of Eisenhower's own promise, in 1952, that
if elected, he would go to Korea.
   The problem was that nobody bothered to tell Eisenhower what
Goldwater was about to propose.
   Goldwater never liked Johnson, and it only heightened his
frustration at the Democratic president's landslide lead, in polls
borne out by the election. Besides, the Democratic president kept
mousetrapping the Republican nominee.
   Goldwater had voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964. That
landmark law, and the threat of a white backlash, were backdrop
realities during the campaign. The senator said he didn't want them
to become divisive issues. A reporter asked whether he had talked
with Johnson about that concern. Goldwater hadn't, but he would.
   Johnson grabbed that opening the instant he learned of it. He
said he'd meet with Goldwater any time. They met, at the White
House, on Johnson's turf and Johnson's terms. Johnson's people then
crafted a joint statement which said in effect that the president
would continue to take the high road on civil rights, and the
Republcan nominee had finally agreed not to make an issue of it.
   On election eve, Goldwater went north to his ``good luck town,''
Fredonia, Ariz., on the Utah border, in Indian country. He'd wound
up his Senate campaigns there, and it would be the last stop on his
presidential campaign, too. One reporter made it his mission to
record for posterity the last words spoke in the campaign. They
were not memorable. They were: ``And if there are any Paiutes out
there, I want to thank you, too.''
   In 1964, the United States had seen three presidents,
Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson, hold office within four years. The
voters weren't about to install a fourth, even had there been a
Republican nominee with wider support than Goldwater found.
Goldwater knew the odds when he hobbled into the campaign, his foot
in a cast after one bone spur surgery. On election night, 1964, at
the Camel Back Inn, Goldwater's staff set up a giant blackboard to
record the popular and electoral vote, state by state.
   From the time the first votes were counted, the Johnson
landslide was evident. Nobody bothered to write a number on the big
blackboard. Chalk never touched it, all night long.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ A South Texas rancher they call the Desert Fox
is a mystery man of Texas politics. Clinton Manges says he's not a
power broker or a kingmaker, but just likes to help his friends.
Some of those friends are now in high places in state government,
while Manges stuggles to shore up a shaky financial empire.

<TEXT>
   FREER, Texas _ Eight miles west of Freer, an arched gateway
marks the entrance to the remote Duval County Ranch that Clinton
Manges calls home.
   The ranch is called The Magic Kingdom. He is called the Desert
Fox.
   The house itself is big and luxurious and open, with the kitchen
set apart by a circular bar and the living area anchored by a
magnificent fireplace. It is a warm and friendly desert hideaway
for a person once described as brilliant, backward, brash, bashful
and ruthless.
   Clinton Manges also has been portrayed as persecuted, powerful,
generous, ignorant, lucky, shy and misunderstood.
   Today, Manges is highly agitated and just a little combative.
   A Seattle bank wants to foreclose on his 100,000-acre ranch to
settle a $53 million debt and the local school district is
demanding $1.5 million in back taxes.
   There are other lawsuits, other creditors, other unpaid bills
and other miseries stemming from his ownership of the San Antonio
Gunslingers of the ill-fated United States Football League.
   But what irks Manges as much as anything is that he wants a new
car and can't get it, despite assets of perhaps several hundred
million dollars.
   His credit and current cash flow are zilch.
   ``There's not a bank in Texas that will loan me 15 cents,'' he
grumbles as he guides a visitor around his ranch and past herds of
deer, buffalo and cattle. ``I've been on a cash basis for five
years.
   ``When they cut off all your blood, somewhere down the line
you're supposed to die. But I didn't.''
   In the Manges mind, ``they'' are a conspiratorial mix of big
banks, big law firms, big oil and big insurance companies. ``They''
are the establishment, the power structure.
   ``They control 95 percent of the wealth in Texas,'' he snorted,
``and they make the politics.
   ``Some of the things they've done to me shouldn't happen to a
dog.''
   Who is Clinton Manges? The answer depends on who you ask.
   ``A liar and a fraud,'' says San Antonio attorney Pat Maloney, a
former friend and legal counsel who once sued Manges for $20
million in a flap over the Gunslingers. It was also Maloney who
said: ``He has a degree of raw courage. He's quick. He's tough.
He's the best trader I've ever seen.''
   San Antonio lawyer James Ingram: ``He's very tough and very
shrewd. I doubt that you could ever apply enough heat to force him
to his knees. He'll fight you till his last breath.''
   A.G. McNeese, retired chief executive officer of Houston's Bank
of the Southwest, now MBank: ``A classic subject for publicity _ a
poor boy, with little formal education, scaling heights so few
people ever reach.''
   State Comptroller Bob Bullock, a longtime Manges friend and
political ally: ``I love the man. He is one of the most generous
people I've known, and not only with money, but time.''
   Land Commissioner Garry Mauro, a remorseful recipient of Manges
campaign largesse: ``He lives in a fantasy world in his Magic
Kingdom, and I don't have the key to the kingdom...If I never see
Clinton Manges again, I'll be better off.''
   Freer car dealer Frank Thomas: ``He's in his realm when he's in
a courtroom fighting a case.''
   Attorney General Jim Mattox: ``To be a capitalist, you've got to
have a little larceny in your heart, and I think he's probably got
a little larceny in his heart. He's been an underdog, and he likes
to help underdogs. I like him.''
   Ruth Manges, Clinton's wife of 42 years and mother of the
couple's four adopted children: ``Everybody in town knows who he
is. But they don't know him.''
   In 1974, Texas newspapers speculated that a ``rags to riches''
rancher named Clinton Manges might seize the South Texas power base
of troubled political boss George Parr, the legendary Duke of Duval
County.
   Parr later killed himself.
   In 1984, Texas Monthly concluded that the newspaper prophecy had
come to pass.
   The magazine described Manges as corrupt and manipulative, a
convicted felon who was reluctant to py his bills. Yet, the article
conceded:
   ``His mystique and money have combined to make him the most
powerful _ and most controversial _ behind-the-scenes figure in
current Texas politics...
   ``No one else has so much influence.''
   Manges angrily dismissed the article as a ``hatchet job.''
   Regarding the crime itself, a false statement on a 1959 Small
Business loan application, Manges friend Lloyd Bentsen, father of
the state's senior U.S. senator, contended that the indictment
``should never have been brought and was only sustained on a
technicality.''
   At 64, Clinton Manges is hefty and balding, with muscular arms
and a round face creased by sun, wind, sand and stress. He often
speaks in rapid spurts, like bursts from a machine gun.

   ``Despite what they call me,'' said Manges, pouring gravy over
freshly fried quail, ``I'm not a kingmaker or a power broker. But I
have helped a lot of people.''
   He said it was no secret that he funneled nearly $1 million into
the 1982 state Democratic primary through a political action
cmmittee headed by Pat Maloney and called Texans for Good
Government.
   But, he smiled, he actually spent about $3 million in that
election, much of it earmarked for a wide range of liberal
Democrats.
   ``The PAC money they know about,'' he said. ``What else I did,
nobody knows.''
   Whatever he did, it was money well spent. His candidates
captured several of the state's top offices, judgeships and
legislative seats.
   Jim Mattox is now attorney general, Garry Mauro is land
commissioner, Bob Bullock is state comptroller and Jim Hightower is
agriculture commissioner.
   All could move up in 1990, when Mattox most likely will run for
governor and Hightower will oppose U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm, a
conservative Republican.
   ``You know why they're ready to move up?'' Manges asked his
visitor. ``Because they're good people. They're clean and they're
fair. You don't catch them running around taking payoffs like that
bunch controlled by the establishment.''
   They're not doing too badly by Manges, either. As
representatives of the state, Mattox and Mauro played pivotal roles
in the 1984 settlement of a $1.7 billion lawsuit filed by Manges
against Mobil Oil Corp.
   With the State of Texas aligned with Manges, Mobil surrendered
its oil and gas lease covering 64,000 acres of the Duval County
Ranch. The settlement was hailed as a $100 million windfall for the
state treasury and a $400 million victory for Manges.
   Those figures are now suspect, based as they were on what was
later described as a ``property, production and paper deal.'' But
there is no doubt that Manges emerged the big winner in his battle
with Mobil.
   ``I wasn't trying to get a fix,'' Manges insists when questioned
about the political funding activities that preceded the state's
intervention in his case. ``All I wanted was a fair shake.''
   ``Mobil didn't want any part of that lawsuit after the election.
They knew they were facing people with no love for big oil
companies and they knew they couldn't buy them.''
   There is no evidence to suggest that Mattox or Mauro peddled
their influence on Manges' behalf or in fact did anything improper.
On the contrary, both maintain the state will reap millions from
the Mobil deal for years to come.
   In an interview at his office in San Antonio, 110 miles north of
Freer, Manges denied claims that he is a deadbeat.
   ``I always pay when I can, and in the end I pay 'em all,'' he
said. ``But sometimes you can't pay because you don't have the
money. And sometimes you file lawsuits to stall 'em until you get
the money to pay 'em.
   ``I never deny my debts to anybody.''
   At the moment, his most pressing concern is Seafirst Bank of
Seattle, which wants to foreclose on his ranch to settle a debt now
exceeding $53 million.
   That debt stems from loans in the early 1980s that Manges used
to finance his high-stakes battle with Mobil and the related
multimillion-dollar political contributions.
   In a curiously worded ruling against Manges this spring, U.S.
District Court Judge H.F. Garcia of San Antonio wrote:
   ``It seems almost unconscionable that the defendants (Manges)
incurred a debt of $50 million, did not pay and had to be sued.
Defendants have no one but themselves to blame for their financial
predicament.
   ``They incurred the debt, and it's time for the fat lady to
sing.''
   Seafirst officials seemed only cautiously optimistic about
collecting anytime soon. Bank attorney Pat Deely says the ranch has
up to a dozen claims against it and the foreclosure cannot proceed
until those are cleared up and a final court judgment secured.
   Manges could torpedo the issue with a bankruptcy filing, but
seems reluctant to do so. Not that he has any warm feelings toward
Seafirst.
   ``They took all my production,'' he complained. ``All my money
goes to Seafirst. They're supposed to return 25 percent to me for
my expenses, but I've never received a cent from them in nearly
five years.''
   His time might come, though, he says.
   ``Things will brighten up when we get a Democrat in there as
governor,'' he beamed, and he fully expects his good buddy Bob
Bullock to be the next lieutenant governor.
   ``They're all there, and they're all in place,'' he said. ``But
I don't want to say anything that might hurt them. I want to help
them. Like I said, I don't want anything from them. I don't need
anything from them.''
   Nothing, that is, ``but a fair shake.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ They are a link between the past and the future,
bridging a communications gap for America's immigrants, teaching
them how to cope in the New World. With some notable exceptions,
foreign-language newspapers are thriving in the United States,
partly as the result of a resurgence of ethnic pride.

   When Li Quanwu arrived here two years ago, he
learned what was facing him from a series of articles on successful
Chinese-Americans in the Chinese-language Centre Daily News.
   ``It taught me that I've got to be in the studio all day to
succeed,'' says the 32-year-old artist, now represented by a major
New York gallery.
   When Enmore Narcisse immigrated from Haiti 10 years ago, he had
little but a driver's license and spoke little English. The Haiti
Observateur, a Creole newspaper based in Brooklyn, helped change
that.
   ``Reading the paper, I found this cab company and got me a
job,'' Narcisse says, slapping the seat of his taxi. ``It also
helped bring me into the Haitian world here.''
   After decades of decline, foreign-language newspapers are making
a comeback in the United States.
   In a 1962 survey of the American, foreign-language press,
Yeshiva University professor Joshua Fishman found 704 publications
in 40 languages. Twenty-two years later, he documented 1,031
publications in 58 languages, including about 100 daily newspapers.
   The papers are teaching new groups of newcomers how to cope with
the New World. And, in a break with the past, second- and
third-generation immigrants are also turning to the papers as a
means of holding onto their cultural heritage.
   ``For first-generation immigrants, the papers play a critical
role in the acclimation process,'' Fishman says. ``They provide
important social, legal and economic information to new Americans.''
   But for second- and third-generation Americans, the papers offer
something less tangible.
   ``For them, the papers play more of a cultural and social
role,'' Fishman says. ``The papers help the readers define
themselves as Americans. After all, we are a nation of immigrants.''
   The foreign-language papers are sensitive to this cultural role,
and it's helped them stay alive, Fishman says. Many papers now run
sections in English or write stories using very simple words in the
mother tongue.
   The heyday of foreign-language newspapers was at the turn of the
century at the height of the European immigration, when nearly
every town with a substantial immigrant population had a
foreign-language press.
   Boston had dozens of Italian and Gaelic papers. New York's
Steinway Street was home to a slew of German-language dailies. The
Jewish Daily Forward built a towering building on Manhattan's Lower
East Side. Papers in Scandinavian languages could be found in
Minnesota.
   But as the older generation died off, leaving a new generation
committed to a future in America, not a past in Europe,
foreign-language papers folded.
   A drop in immigration due to the Depression and legislation
restricting entry to the United States further hurt the industry.
   It was not until the 1960s that immigration _ and the
foreign-language press _ began to rise again, helped in part by a
more liberal quota system for immigrants and economic troubles in
other parts of the world. But the accents and the colors of the
immigrants had changed.
   At the turn of the century, 80 percent of the immigrants came
from Europe. Starting in the 1960s, the majority came from Asia and
developing countries in Africa and South America.
   Between 1955 and 1965, for example, the number of Chinese in New
York's Chinatown increased eight times to 165,000, replacing the
European Jews, Italians and Irish. By the early 1970s, at least
eight Chinese-language newspapers were being published.
   At the same time, a Haitian community was taking root in
Brooklyn, long home to Italians and Jews. Vietnamese refugees were
moving to California. Newspapers followed both.
   A growth in ethnic pride and awareness, fueled by the 1960's
civil rights movement, also helped spur an increase in the number
of papers.
   Americans who had lived here for decades began to look for their
roots, seeking a sense of community unavailable from American
society-at-large.
   New York's two healthy Greek papers are examples of newspapers
that are succeeding despite dwindling immigration from Greece.
   But the 110-year-old Il Progresso, the nation's only
Italian-language newspaper, announced in early July it was shutting
down because of a labor dispute.
   In addition to the roles they play in America, many ethnic
newspapers in America also try to affect life in the old country,
raising money for political movements and pushing for social change.
   During the 1986 presidential campaign in the Philippines, the
weekly Philippine News, published in South San Francisco with a
circulation of 77,000, raised $3.5 million for candidate Corazon
Aquino, according to publisher Alejandro Esclamado.
   The Haiti Observateur (circulation 65,000) fought the Duvalier
regime for years and continues to agitate for democracy in that
Caribbean nation.
   ``I look at my paper as a vehicle for political
transformation,'' says the editor, Raymond Joseph, a former Wall
Street Journal reporter. ``When I was younger I believed in
guerrilla warfare. Now it's the power of the press.''
   In contrast, Novoye Russkoye Slovo (circulation 50,000), a
Russian-language paper published in Manhattan, doesn't push
politics. It's concerned with teaching Russian immigrants about
America.
   ``We want our readers to be involved in American life,'' says
Lawrence Wajnberg, executive vice president of the paper. ``Anyone
who thinks they're going back is nuts.''
   Helping readers adapt to their new home has always been a
priority for the foreign-language press. In years past, the Jewish
Daily Forward ran an advice column called Bintel Brev, Yiddish for
a packet of letters; readers asked about the intricacies of
baseball, intermarriages and social mores.
   In today's newspapers, articles on immigration law, drugs, AIDS
and real estate abound.
   In a Chinatown dumpling house, Cindi Mei and three friends pore
over the World Journal, catching up on the latest gossip about
Taiwan's movie stars. While the World Journal supports the Taiwan
government, the opposition Centre Daily News supports mainland
China, the communists.
   ``It's good to know so that when I go back to Taiwan in the
summer I'll know what my friends are talking about,'' says the
17-year-old third-generation American. ``It also helps me keep up
my Chinese.''
   Many immigrants complain that their papers just reprint stories
from the American press.
   ``What you get in the Daily News we get in the Korean papers two
days, even three days later,'' says William Kim, a
second-generation proprietor of a laundry in lower Manhattan. ``But
reading English is a headache, so I've got no choice.'

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ With hotel prices going through the roof in many
places, more and more travelers are looking for bed-and-breakfast
accommodations in private homes. It's the fastest-growing segment
of the hospitality industry and it's no longer confined to the
country. Bed and breakfast hosts are springing up all over the Big
Apple. One reason is that it helps New Yorkers pay their own
exorbitant housing costs.

   If Valerie Dimitri's bed-and-breakfast guests
don't look out the window, they can they can fantasize that they
are staying in a cozy country cottage, complete with a fat cat
sitting in front of a white brick fireplace.
   Actually it's a Manhattan penthouse facing East 86th Street,
with a noisy rumble of fume-spewing buses, taxis, trucks and people
down below.
   ``Well, if you want us to replicate the inn in Vermont, you
better go there,'' says Mary McAuley, proprietor of Urban Ventures,
one of seven registries that send visitors to bed-and-breakfast
hosts in the Big Apple.
   Ms. McAuley and others in the B&B industry say the market for
their brand of big-city hostelries is booming in the 1980s.
   They appeal to business people tired of staying in $100-a-night
hotel rooms where brass statues are riveted to tabletops to prevent
theft; to tourists tired of paying $13 for a bowl of cereal.
   B&Bs are an affordable way to explore urban life. Prices range
from $45 to $90 a night for two, depending on the location and
other amenities. The arrangement is also helping a lot of New
Yorkers pay their soaring housing costs.
   Overseas visitors have long known the charms of B&Bs, which
originated in Europe. The idea spread to America early in the
century, but the cottage industry was nearly wiped out after World
War II when rural roadways dotted with B&Bs were replaced by
highways and motel chains.
   Country and seashore B&Bs and unusual urban inns like San
Francisco's Bishop Mansion survived, but city B&Bs disappeared.
   Things began to change around 1979 thanks to rising housing and
hotel costs. Big city B&Bs are now ``the fastest growing segment of
the hospitality industry,'' says Susan Morris of Bed and Breakfast
Association Worldwide, Inc., a New Orleans-based trade group.
   Urban Ventures had 15 hosts in 1979. In 1988, it has 700.
   The number of people using big-city B&Bs has increased 200
percent to 300 percent each year, Ms. Morris says. One reason is
their variety.
   ``They come in condos and apartments and mansions and even in
yachts in some locations,'' she says. There are ranches and log
cabins in the West, antebellum mansions in the South and French
Quarter homes in New Orleans.
   In New York, guests can find rooms in nearly every Manhattan
neighborhood, from an artsy loft in Soho to a tony Central Park
penthouse. There also are a few B&Bs in the outer boroughs of
Queens and Brooklyn.
   There are even country-style places like Valerie Dimitri's
penthouse.
   Cheery country red walls welcome visitors into an apartment
filled with antiques and lace. A black kettle doorstop and scatter
rugs strewn over polished hardwood floors add a country cottage
atmosphere.
   In the living room, a small round table near the window is
covered with delicate, spidery lace and adorned with yellowed
family photographs. Guests can cozy into an overstuffed claw-footed
chair with a cup of Valerie's own blackberry tea.
   Some hosts enter the business ``because they like to meet people
from other parts of the country and other parts of the world,''
says Ms. Morris. Others do it out of necessity. ``In the cities,
it's a help in paying exorbitant rents people are being charged
now.''
   At Urban Ventures, Ms. McAuley estimates her hosts average
$10,000 a year
   _ some more, some less, depending on how often they book guests.
   Ms. Dimitri is one of Urban Ventures' most popular hostesses.
   ``I like to get a little fancy-schmancy,'' says the diminutive
Ms. Dimitri, a speechwriter. ``I put mints under pillows, give
honeymooning couples a split of champagne and always use the good
crystal.''
   She delighted one couple, in town to start a bicycling
honeymoon, by decorating their bikes with crepe-paper ribbons and
``Just Married'' signs.
   Notes and fresh flowers welcome each guest; bus and subway maps
and magazines tell them what's going on around town, and Ms.
Dimitri offers tips on the best restaurants and Broadway shows. She
caters to the whims of her guests, such as the prince who eats
vanilla yogurt for breakfast.
   Guests pay Ms. Dimitri $65 a night for one or $80 for two. But
they often find other ways to repay her kindnesses, like the
80-year-old French perfumer who sends her a bottle of his special
scent each year on her birthday.
   New York B&Bs may not offer all the amenities of their country
cousins. By and large, Ms. McAuley says, breakfasts are ``not going
to be the great stuff like Mama's homemade biscuits.''
   ``Besides a few retired hosts, most are not going to be hanging
around the house. Our hosts are nurses, they're interns...they have
a place to be at 8-9 in the morning and they're not going to sit
around and chat.''
   Allan Arrow, an aspiring writer, bought a five-room penthouse in
the theater district and finds that he often has enough guests to
pay his monthly mortgage and maintenance expenses.
   David Turner of Collingswood, N.J., was in New York for several
job interviews and stayed at Arrow's digs for five days.
   ``If you can afford a suite at the Plaza or the Palace, that's
wonderful. But small inexpensive hotels in New York are a drag,''
Turner says. ``Someone told me about this and it seemed like a real
nice alternative, and it is.''
   Not coincidentally, a new play Arrow is working on is set inside
a bed-and-breakfast place. In a big city. In a penthouse, to be
exact.
   ``It's got a lot of amusing possibilities,'' he says.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ When the skiing is done with and Aspen, Colo.,
settles down to a more placid way, it's an enviable setting for
thinkers of cosmic thoughts. That's what a large group of notables,
who have much to do with America's designs for living, does for one
very cerebral week each year.

   For nearly 40 years, when other people's
thoughts turn to vacations and light summer reading, a select
contingent of conventioneers has descended on this pastoral Alpine
playground to contemplate the state of civilization.
   This year again, some 1,500 creative people who influence the
way much of the world buys products, wears clothes, reads books,
drives cars, eats, sleeps and works came to ponder and discuss.
Their theme was ``The Cutting Edge.''
   Or, put another way, where are we as a global society, as the
human race? That was the question co-chairmen Jay Chiat, a Los
Angeles-based advertising man, and Henry Wolf, a New York-based
photographer and graphic designer, bit off and left for the 38th
International Design Conference to chew.
   ``...it seems that many of us have serious doubts that
significant progress has taken place in literature, advertising,
architecture, and product and graphic design since the '60s,''
Chiat said in the conference program. ``Is this true? If so, why?
If not, why don't we believe it? Is there a cutting edge? Or is it
as dull out there as some of us think?''
   The IDCA was started in 1951 by the late Walter Paepke, chairman
of the Container Corporation of America. Paepke was a millionaire
businessman who, along with his wife, Elizabeth, who still lives in
Aspen, set out to make this mostly dilapidated Victorian-era
Colorado mining town a mecca for intellectuals and artists. The
entertainers and jet set followed.
   The first conference, ``Design as a Function of Management,''
explored the relationship of design to business.
   In 1951, TV was a fledgling medium that would change the world.
The first commercial color telecast was aired and dacron suits,
sugarless chewing gum, orlon and a commercial electronic computer
made their debut.
   In the intervening years, the folks who've designed everything
from cars to computers to commercials, the graphic artists,
painters, writers, social scientists, museum directors, film-makers
_ the men and women who decorate and stimulate our physical and
mental lives _ have made the pilgrimage to Aspen to learn how
design is integrated into politics, art, business, science,
education, and philosophy.
   Ted Goudvis, a retired mining engineer and Aspen resident who's
been attending the conference for eight years, found that the
speakers last June had a more ``idealistic slant.''
   Some ominous notes intruded. Dr. Howard H. Hiatt, former dean of
the Harvard School of Public Health and currently senior physician
at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, told the audience
that the AIDS toll in the United States ``is already catastrophic
but we have only seen the beginning.''
   He urged more government funding to combat acquired immune
deficiency syndrome and a national system of health care. ``I hope
the cutting edge, the state of things to be, will be a more humane
society,'' he said.
   A group of museum directors, including Kinshasha Conwill,
executive director of the Studio Museum in Harlem, and Richard
Koshalek, director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los
Angeles, noted that 80 percent of Americans live in cities and said
art has to go to the people.
   ``We defined space in Los Angeles that is outlined by four
freeways and we consider that our turf,'' said Koshalek, who's held
art exhibits in parking lots and now has a revolving collection in
a hardware store named The Temporary Contemporary.
   Ms. Conwill said she believed ``the current American art scene
is lacking in originality and vigor, and black artists are absent
from that arena,'' but added that her museum was spotlighting Negro
artists in ``probably the most important black community in the
world, Harlem.''

   The conference was held among the manicured meadows of the Aspen
Institute for Humanistic Studies, also founded by the Paepkes.
Right away, the snack bar menu revealed it wasn't an ordinary
convention. Forget greasy burgers and fries, this was Aspen, home
of the too-thin, the too-rich. Here you have toubouleh sandwiches,
yogurt and cucumber soup, and brie with grapes.
   The participants were overwhelmingly Big City Dwellers From the
Coasts. Because most were designers, wardrobes ran the gamut from
silks to sleaze, black to brazen, polished to punk. The crowd's
differentness became a sameness.
   Set amid wildflowers and fresh air, spectacular sunsets and
snowcapped mountains, the gathering had its share of famous names.
   Former television talk show host Dick Cavett acted as a floating
moderator.
   David Puttnam, producer of 29 films, including ``Chariots of
Fire'' and ``The Killing Fields,'' talked about his disagreements
with the chiefs at Coca Cola, Inc., parent company of Columbia
Studios which Puttnam recently headed, and the state of movies
today.
   ``A movie should start out attempting to be everything _ good,
exciting, commercial in the best sense _ and leave an aftertaste,''
Puttnam said. ``Where we are at now is a lack of ambition in what
films can do. The dream in cinema is gone. I think money corrupts
the creative process. The sheer cost of making a film today takes
away (creative) risk.''
   Puttnam, a Briton who lives in London and now produces films for
Warner Brothers Studios, said unwillingness to take creative
chances pervades American corporate life today.
   ``There is this extraordinary pressure to perform, to
out-perform last year, to out-perform this year,'' said Puttnam, a
fan of smaller-budget movies with unknown actors and directors.
``The reason we are chasing the Japanese is that the Japanese have
this extraordinary ability to make a decision and then take a long
view.''
   Paul Goldberger, architecture critic of The New York Times since
1973, said that in the past few years ``there has been a tendency
to believe that the most profound effect of architecture has been
deciding what kind of molding to put on the $3 million beach house
of an investment banker.''
   ``Architects have become so obsessed with size, corporate power
and the lushness of detail that the idea that architecture serves a
social purpose has been forgotten,'' Goldberger said.
   Feminist Betty Friedan, founder of the National Organization for
Women and author of ``The Feminine Mystique'' and ``The Second
Stage'' and now at work on ``The Fountain of Age,'' said a new
feminine mystique is telling American women to give up the social,
economic and legal gains of the past two decades and ``put on the
girdle again, put on the miniskirt'' and go home again.
   ``The answer is `repent of your ways, of your feminist dreams,
of your ideas and your aspirations...,''' Friedan said facetiously,
nearly drowned out by laughter and applause. ``This economy would
really collapse if the women went home again, to say nothing of the
family's economy.''
   Friedan thought the nation was coming to the end of an era of
devotion to greed and gave it a verbal shove:
   ``The nation's resources are great enough to accept public
responsibility. ...If we let go unchallenged this culture of greed,
of privatism, not only are the poor, the homeless, the underclass
going to create (a possible) depression, the middle class, the
professional class and our children, earning more than we did when
we were their age, are going to have a mean life.''
   So what is The Cutting Edge, and where is it?
   ``The cutting edge is not always where we assume it to be,''
said IDCA co-chairman Wolf. ``It crops up in unpredictable places
and the prognosticators have a very hard time finding it.''

   The Judds, the mother-daughter team that bounded
out of nowhere to country music stardom less than five years ago,
will get their rags-to-riches story told in a fall special on CBS.
   ``People will have a chance to see us on the road and see what
it's like to go through what we're going through, the pressures of
being so close professionally and personally,'' says Wynonna Judd,
24. ``We filmed all day long yesterday in Colesburg, Ky., where
Mama's brother, who's a Baptist preacher, has a small church.''
   As the Judds toured on the country music circuit this summer, TV
cameras also followed them to New York, Iowa, California and
Tennessee.
   Naomi Judd, who is 18 years older than her daughter but looks
more like her sister, says, ``The image we have right now is that
we're almost joined at the lips. We share a common bond in music.
We're alike in a lot of ways, but we're very different. The
director thinks that's interesting enough to investigate in-depth.''
   The Judds popped into country music prominence in 1984. While
Wynonna was in high school they had shunned honky-tonks and
practiced at home, working on Wynonna's singing and acoustic guitar
playing and Naomi's harmonizing, and the family image they wanted
to project.
   ``We got signed at a live audition,'' Naomi says. ``We didn't
have biographies or photographs, had never had a band or played in
public.''
   A deal was made with Curb Records and RCA. Brent Maher has
produced all their albums, using arranger Don Potter, top country
songwriters and sticking to the presentation the Judds already had
worked out.
   ``When our first single (``Had a Dream'') was on the radio, I
was working full time as a nurse and Wynonna was a temporary
secretary,'' Naomi says.
   After the second single, ``Mama He's Crazy,'' reached No. 1 on
the country charts, the Judds still had flea-market furniture and
unmatched dishes.
   When the Country Music Association presented awards in October
1984, the Judds won the Horizon Award, essentially meaning ``best
new act.'' The CMA named them vocal group of the year and they also
won Grammy Awards for best country performance by a duo or group,
the following three years.
   ``Mom and I haven't always had it this wonderful,'' Wynonna says.
   Naomi still turns off lights when she leaves a room and clips
grocery coupons. ``All my life I felt I was a face in the crowd,
not having any money,'' she says.
   Naomi has another daughter, Ashley, who has finished her
sophomore year at the University of Kentucky, studying French,
history and art history. She is not a singer, but Naomi says, ``In
the summer we like to take her out and slam her around on the road
a little bit. I don't want her to think that it's easy. Last year I
paid her $10 a day to be bus engineer. It meant cleaning the bus.''
Ashley declined the position this year.
   Naomi took back her maiden name, Judd, after she was divorced in
California and returned with her daughters to her native Kentucky.
``We'd been in Hollywood seven years,'' Naomi says. ``They were
thinking Hollywood was home and normal. We went to Morrill, Ky. It
had maybe 200 people.
   ``We lived on a hilltop, didn't have a telephone or TV. I wanted
them to develop their imaginations and play together. They worked
in the garden, learned about animals.''
   Naomi entered nursing school; Wynonna began singing.
   ``Mom had a guitar someone had given her,'' she says. ``I had a
friend who would teach me. Someone gave me a book. I guess I'm
lucky to have an ear for learning. I would listen to the radio and
try to get all I could, teaching myself.
   ``We would buy discount records. We didn't have the money for
full-price albums. It caused us to discover all these weird but
wonderful types of music. My first influence was Bluegrass.''
   Only Ashley lives with her mother now. Wynonna bought a small
farm in Franklin, Tenn., ``close enough to call Mom to say I'm
coming over.''
   ``A lot of times Mom and I couldn't get along but we could still
sing together,'' Wynonna says. ``You have someone to share the
joys, awards, excitement and incredible opportunities with. Other
times, being so close, we know how to bug each other.''
   Naomi says of her daughter, ``She makes me the maddest of
anybody and makes me laugh the loudest.''

   At age 85, Al Hirschfeld is still drawing in the
dark, capturing in his unique caricatures the essence and spirit of
Broadway.
   For six decades, the genial, white-bearded artist has sat in the
theater and sketched, making graceful line drawings that seem to
come alive on the page.
   `I've learned to annoy as few people as possible,'' he was
saying the other day, reflecting on all the hard work he has done
during performances with a small sketch pad and a Venus HB pencil.
   Hirschfeld was sitting in a barber chair in his studio on the
top floor of an East Side brownstone where he has lived for more
than 40 years with his wife, Dolly. It's where he finishes all his
drawings.
   Today, Hirschfeld draws more than theater folk. Movie stars,
television personalities, politicians, even ordinary citizens are
his subjects, but it's the theater drawings, particularly his
sketches that appear regularly in The New York Times, that most
people remember.
   On a slanted and well-worn drawing table perched in front of the
barber chair, Hirschfeld opens a large sketch book. It's filled
with what look like random doodles _ a cigar, wicker furniture, the
detail of window, a bow tie. They're bits and pieces of
remembrances from the recent Broadway production of ``Long Day's
Journey into Night.''
   ``These are very helpful in putting together a sketch,'' he
says. ``You can't trust a faulty memory.''
   These sketches were interspersed with roughly drawn portraits of
the play's two stars, Jason Robards and Colleen Dewhurst.
   ``She has a way of putting her hand to her face all the time,''
he says.
   Hirschfeld says he does no research before beginning to sketch a
new show.
   ``The characters are what interests me, but as for the play
itself, sometimes I come out and I don't know what it was all
about,'' he says. ``When I'm working, I concentrate on the actual
design or the image rather than the thought. Later I go to the
opening and can see the play.''
   Hirschfeld has always been partial to drawing the
larger-than-life actors, particularly comedians.
   ``Most of them have invented themselves,'' he says. ``They know
what they look like. People like Carol Channing, Zero Mostel and,
in the earlier days, the Marx Brothers, Buster Keaton, Charlie
Chaplin or Mae West. They were all real inventions. The modern
actor is a little more the fellow next door. The people in the
street are more theatrical than most actors today.''
   The artist used to go out of town, to Philadelphia, Boston or
New Haven, to see new shows and do his sketches. Today, with the
Broadway tryout a rare occurrence, he goes to rehearsals or
run-throughs to do his sketching or even draws from photographs or
videocassettes supplied by producers.
   ``It's the little things that help develop the character in a
drawing,'' Hirschfeld explains. ``Some simple little thing, like
the way a fellow holds his hand or his cigarette. George Burns, for
instance, the way he holds a cigar is very unique. He holds it
differently than Groucho does.''
   Hirschfeld, born in St. Louis, started out as a sculptor and
later turned to painting.
   ``Then suddenly I developed this insane passion for line, and
what you can do with it, and how it can communicate,'' he recalls.
``It's always mysterious to me how it happens.''
   His first drawing in The New York Times appeared in 1925, a
sketch of Sir Harry Lauder, a famous comedian of the day, making
one of many ``farewell'' tours in New York.
   From then on, Hirschfeld was hooked on the theater and the
actors on stage.
   ``I'm more interested in people than in nature,'' he says. ``It
would never occur to me to sit on the lip of the Grand Canyon and
paint it. I'm interested in people, the way they dress and eat and
walk and dance and talk. Whatever they do.''
   Hirschfeld's drawings have also intrigued people because he puts
``Nina,'' the name of his daughter, in all his sketches. He got the
idea the day she was born in 1945.
   ``I just wanted to record it historically that she was here,''
he says. ``I kept it up for two or three weeks and then tried to
stop it. I would leave Nina out but the mail was unbelievable.''
   Today, ``Nina'' is always the last thing to go into one of his
drawings and he puts a little number next to his name if there are
two or more Ninas in a picture.
   Nina will even make an appearance on a postage stamp. Hirschfeld
has designed three 25-cent stamps _ portraits of Laurel and Hardy,
Mary Pickford and Rosa Ponselle _ that the Postal Service will
release over the next year. It took a special decision by
Postmaster General Anthony Frank to allow the stamps to have Nina
imprinted on them.
   Hirschfeld calls his job ``a lemming profession,'' one which
apparently has no future, and says there are very few outlets for
his kind of work.
   ``I'm always surprised that I get paid for all of this,''
Hirschfeld says. ``I would do it anyway. Maybe not in the theater
but I certainly would be sitting around a cafe and be doodling away.
   ``My demands on life are very small. I like what I'm doing. I
don't have any hobbies. I'm here all day long seven days a week and
in the evening we go to the theater or have people in and sit
around and talk. I find that very engaging. I could never retire. I
wouldn't know what to do with my time.''

   On an April day in 1908, the steamship
Kasato Maru set sail from Kobe, Japan, with 781 Japanese peasants
contracted to work on the coffee plantations of Brazil. Their plan
was to come home in two to five years and start new lives with
their earnings.
   But most stayed in Brazil to become the founders of what today
is the world's largest Japanese community outside Japan _ 1,168,000
strong.
   They are Brazilians first, they tell you, but as Japan has risen
in economic power and influence across the world, they are feeling
the pull of the land of their ancestors:
   _Andre Hori, 20, wearing faded blue jeans and a white sweat
shirt, kneels silently on a straw mat, his eyes riveted on the
kimono-clad instructor who patiently goes through the precise
movements of the ``chado,'' centuries-old Japanese tea ceremony.
   _A few blocks away in downtown Sao Paulo, Hifumi Konno, 55, in a
blue and white cotton kimono, rehearses the delicate and intricate
steps of the ``Kyo Fujima Ryo,'' one of Japan's traditional
classical dance forms.
   The renewed interest in homeland traditions is a relatively
recent phenomenon among Brazil's Japanese, according to Luis
Masahiro Hanada, executive secretary of the Brazil-Japan Cultural
Alliance.
   ``For many years, especially after Japan's defeat in World War
II, the main concern in the community was to integrate, to be as
Brazilian as possible. This led to an almost total rejection of
anything identified with Japan,'' he said in an interview.
   ``But in the 1970s, as Japan prospered, many in the community
started feeling a strong sense of curiosity and a need to
understand and recover a cultural past which for years had been
ignored.''
   He added that over the past 10 years the number of people
learning Japanese at the Cultural Alliance ``has been increasing by
15 percent annually.'' The alliance houses Brazil's largest
Japanese-language school, with more than 2,000 students.
   Similar increases have been registered in courses of traditional
Japanese art forms such as flower arrangements, origami (paper
folding) and caligraphy, he said.
   Andre Hori explained why he decided to learn the tea ceremony
and take Japanese language classes.
   ``I always felt that Japan's recovery after the war and its
current economic strength could best be understood by studying its
culture, something I knew nothing about,'' he said.
   Kaesundri Wakisaka, one the directors of the Japanese-Brazilian
Research Center, said another important reason for the community's
renewed interest in its cultural background is ``a kind of
instinctive concern that one day these traditions may disappear.''
   During a break in her dance rehearsals, Mrs. Konno said, ``If we
don't learn and transmit our cultural heritage to the younger
generations, it will all fade away.''
   She said that despite her efforts, her two daughters have shown
little interest ``in following my example. They have become too
Brazilian.''
   Wakisaka said the Japanese community's assimilation into
Brazilian culture and society was ``progressing so smoothly and
steadily that in 50 years it will be almost impossible to
distinguish it as an ethnically different group.''
   He said the main reason was growing number of interracial
marriages. Wakisaka estimated there were about 115,00 marriages in
Brazil between the descendants of Japanese and non-Japanese.
   Most Japanese-Brazilians interviewed insisted that their life
styles and way of thinking are Brazilian, but they make clear their
heritage is not far behind.
   Kenichi Yamai, a 58-year-old attorney said, ``I am so Brazilian
that I only remember my Japanese background when I look at myself
in the mirror.''
   But, sitting on a beige sofa in his three bedroom apartment, he
said he never misses a chapter of ``Takeda Shigen'' (The Great
Samurai), a soap opera produced in Japan and aired every Sunday in
Japanese by a local TV station.
   He also starts his day reading Sao Paulo Shimbun, one of three
Japanese-language newspapers published in Sao Paulo.
   With his wife Emi sitting at his side, Yamai also said he
insisted that his daughter Regina, a 28-year-old dentist, ``marry a
Japanese because mixed marriages never work out. And when my two
sons are ready to marry, I will make the same demand.''
   Carlos Nakayashi, a 43-year-old economist, said, ``No matter how
Brazilian we feel or act or are seen by others, there is no denying
our heritage. It's in our blood and will never go away.''
   For Harumi Kawasaki, a 50-year-old teacher in a Japanese
language school, ``being Japanese in Brazil is like having a split
personality, for we are constantly straddling two entirely
different cultures.''

<TEXT>
   MANABUA MABE, artist _ Born in Japan in 1924, Mabe immigrated to
Brazil with his parents in 1935. After 10 years of picking coffee
beans, he started painting figurative art but soon moved to
abstractionist paintings. His first public recognition as an artist
came in 1957 when he won the Best National Painter Award at the Sao
Paulo Bienal International Art Exhibition. Two years later he was
awarded the Best Foreign Painter Award at the Paris Bienal Art
Show. Mabe has a studio in New York but continues to paint at his
home in Sao Paulo, exhibiting his work in Brazil and abroad.

<TEXT>
   TOMIE OHTAKE, artist _ Born in Japan in 1914, she came to Brazil
in 1936 to visit relatives but decided to stay after the
Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937 and falling in love with
agronomist Ruy Ohtake, whom she married. She started painting as a
hobby, but friends and relatives insisted she go public and in 1957
she exhibited her work at Sao Paulo's Museum of Modern Art. In
September she will have a one-woman show in Japan _ one of many
countries where her paintings can be found.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   FUJIO TACHIBANA, banker _ He came to Brazil as a 20-year-old in
1932 to work on a coffee plantation. Because of his training as an
accountant, he landed a job in 1938 with the Bratac Banking House
that two years later became the America do Sul Bank, one of
Brazil's largest. He became president in 1978 and still holds that
prestigious position.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HIRO HI URUSHIMA, entrepreneur _ He was 11 years old when he
arrived in Brazil with his parents and seven brothers in 1936. Like
most other Japanese immigrants, he worked on a coffee plantation.
But in 1938 his family left the plantation and Urushima went to
work in a radio repair shop in the city of Sao Paulo. In the 1940s
he started his own business building transformers and radio
receivers. In 1954 he began building car radios and selling them to
stores and individuals. Nine years later he founded Motoradio,
which today employs more than 2,000 workers at three different
factories making table and car radios as well as a wide variety of
electronic components.

   ANTONIO UENO, congressman _ The 65-year-old Ueno is one of three
congressmen of Japanese descent re-writing Brazil's constitution in
Brasilia, the national capital. Born in 1923 in the southern state
of Parana, he spent his childhood helping his parents pick coffee
and cotton on local plantations. But they insisted he go to school
and in 1953 he graduated college with a degree in economics. He
entered politics as a councilman in the small town of Assai in
Parana. In 1965 he got a law degree and two years later was elected
to the Chamber of Deputies of Brasil's Congress. He has been a
congressman ever since. He presented 134 bills for the new
constitution and 34 of which have been approved, most favoring
foreign capital investments in Brazil.

   Silicone, plaster and glue can go a long
way toward helping to heal wounded self-images.
   ``I think it's amazing,'' says Denis Lee, head of the University
of Michigan Medical Center's Medical Sculpture Unit. ``A lot of
people, when they first come, are hesitant about wearing anything
artificial or rubber. They think it will fall off, or people will
laugh.
   ``After they see the results, it's incredible.''
   Hundreds of people each year who have lost an eye, ear, nose,
finger, toe, breast or other feature to birth defects, cancer,
accidents and fire _ and who can't be helped by plastic surgery _
seek assistance from prosthetic artists.
   ``I really don't know what to say for making me feel like a
whole person again,'' a 69-year-old Ohio woman, whose face was
disfigured and right eye lost to cancer, wrote to Lee. ``People
just can't believe how anyone can do such a wonderful job. I can go
anyplace and people don't stare.
   ``It's a wonderful feeling to have in my life again.''
   Stan Stasilowicz, 63, of Union Lake, lost his right ear to
cancer two decades ago. ``I said to some of my cronies that I got a
new ear, and they said which one? It was very exhilarating.''
   Prosthetics can be especially important for children, says Lee,
who is seeking a corporate sponsor for a center for disfigured
children here. ``If not treated properly and quickly, they can have
psychological problems. Children can be pretty cruel and
(disfigured) children get teased.''
   Popular shows and movies have helped alleviate that problem. In
the ``Six Million Dollar Man,'' and ``Bionic Woman'' series, people
with mechanical parts have superhuman strength, and the recent
movie ``Robo Cop'' dealt with replacing lost features and organs
with mechanical ones.
   ``If they're the bionic kid,'' Lee says, ``they're the hit of
the class.''
   Of about 200 patients treated here annually Lee estimates the
breakdown is 50 ears, 30 breasts, 20 noses, 20 eyes and 50
``miscellaneous.'' Most health insurance covers the cost, which
runs about $1,400 for an ear or nose and $2,000 for an eye.
   There are about 200 prosthetic sculptors working in the United
States, most of them affiliated with Michigan, a Veterans
Administration clinic in New York City and a medical center
associated with Baylor University, according to Lee, who also
directs a 22-year-old graduate program to train the artists.
   The University of Illinois, Ohio State University, Johns Hopkins
University, the Medical College of Georgia and the University of
Texas also offer such courses. ``It's harder to get into than
medical school. It's a very strange combination to have people
interested in science and art _ that's why the program is so
small,'' Lee says.
   The course of study includes anatomy, pathology, anatomical
sketching, medical and scientific drawing, and medical graphics.
Graduates generally can set up their own business, freelance, or
work for a hospital or medical center.
   One works for ``Star Wars'' creator George Lucas' Industrial
Light and Magic making creatures for science fiction films.
   Sculptors take a plaster mold of the patient's undamaged
feature, then make a silicone rubber copy and carefully match skin
tone. The replacement is applied daily with a medical adhesive.
   Though the appearance of prostheses are strikingly realistic,
many of Lee's patients are apprehensive about how well they will
work. ``People ask if it will fall off in their soup.''
   One of the center's success stories is a 3-year-old Lakeworth,
Fla., girl who lost half her right foot in a lawnmower accident.
Within six months of getting her prosthesis, she was taking ballet
lessons.
   ``Her mother says she won't take her silicone rubber toes off,''
Lee says.

<HEAD>In Complex Medical Cases, Ethics Comes To Forefront</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARK RIDGE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Questions surrounding withholding and
cost of treatment, and even confidentiality, have hospitals turning
more frequently to special consultants and committees to help
search for the answers.
   The American Hospital Association estimates that at least 60
percent of U.S. hospitals with 200 or more beds have such
committees, made up of doctors, philosophers, theologians and
social workers. A report in last week's Journal of the American
Medical Association said 30 percent of 280 patients in a Virginia
study presented ethical problems.
   Some hospitals, like Lutheran General Hospital, have doctors
like John La Puma as consultants. La Puma does at least two
consultations a week.
   An ethics consultant helps clarify issues and ``provides a lot
of comfort for myself as a primary care physician,'' said Dr.
Stuart Goldman, director of research and family practice at
Lutheran General.
   In addition to medicine's capacity to prolong life, ``in a
society where lawsuits are common, lawsuits are less likely when an
ethics committee has been consulted,'' said Dr. David Larson,
director of Loma Linda University's Center for Christian Bioethics
in California. ``It's harder to demonstrate that a doctor has acted
unprofessionally.''
   The fact that not all ethics consultants are doctors raises
other issues.
   Among them, said Arthur L. Caplan, director of the Center for
Biomedical Ethics at the University of Minnesota, are ``Who should
be entitled to do this and what qualifications and training should
they have? What are the proper duties to give to someone who is an
ethics consultant _ teaching, troubleshooting, or policy-making?
What is the job?''
   Another unresolved issue is consultants' legal responsibility,
said Caplan. ``I think, down the road, the courts are going to have
to clarify their role.''
   Medical guidelines will ease debate over withholding treatment,
said La Puma. ``The big ethical issue of the 1990s is going to be
medical indigents, and what kind of care we provide for patients
who cannot provide for themselves.''

<HEAD>Cornell Ornithology Center Is Nest Of Information For Birders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some professional birdwatchers look down
on amateurs, but the legacy of America's first ornithology
professor unites their work.
   Cornell University's Laboratory of Ornithology, which owes its
creation to Arthur A. Allen, contains millions of pages of behavior
studies and photographs and the world's largest collection of
birdsongs _ more than 5,000 species.
   Equally important, it links ornithologists and amateur
birdwatchers. ``The game is to position the laboratory between the
professional community and the birding community, the amateur and
the professional,'' said executive director Charles Walcott. ``We
are an information broker between the two.''
   Allen, an expert on red-winged blackbirds and pioneer in
recording and filming wild birds, headed North America's only
doctoral program in ornithology from the 1920s to the '40s. Lyman
K. Stuart, a business graduate and student of Allen's, financed
much of the lab and 180-acre sanctuary near Ithaca.
   The laboratory generates money through dues and project fees,
sale of publications and bird recordings, and home-study courses in
ornithology and bird photography.
   Its 1-year-old Project FeederWatch last year paid 4,000
birdwatchers to fill out a computerized form twice weekly recording
the species that appear at their backyard feeders. The goal this
year is 10,000.
   ``We can only begin to guess at what we might have been able to
accomplish if we had had this kind of information years ago,''
Walcott said, ``how many extinct species we could have saved.''

<HEAD>New Solar Cell Stack Yields Greater Conversion Efficiency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBUQUERQUE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new combination of solar cells cracked a
U.S. Department of Energy's efficiency goal, and could find use in
the space program or eventual Earth-bound solar power plants,
officials say.
   Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories stacked a gallium
arsenide solar cell made by Varian Associates Inc. of Palo Alto,
Calif., on a silicon cell from Stanford University to achieve a 31
percent efficiency rating. It can generate 31 watts of electricity
for every 100 watts of sunlight it collects.
   DOE had set a 30 percent efficiency goal, and previous attempts
at stacking yielded 20 percent, said Sandia's Dan Arvizu.
   The gallium arsenide cell is best at converting light on the
blue segment of the spectrum, while the silicon chip is better on
red. Each cell is about 27 percent efficient. Researchers may
almost have reached the limit of efficiency for single solar cells,
so stacking is the most promising way to achieve high efficiency,
said Jan Werthen, Varian's manager of solar research.
   ``The bottom line is how much is the electricity on a
cents-per-kilowatt-hour basis,'' said Robert Annan, head of DOE's
photovoltaic energy technology division. Some coal- and oil-fired
power systems cost 30 cents per kwh, and Sandia's new chip might
generate at 12 cents within a decade, Annan said.
   Similar costs might also be possible with a cell developed by
the Solar Energy Research Institute and Arco Solar, Annan said.
SERI and Arco reduced the cost of production, while Sandia
increased efficiency, he said.

<HEAD>Softer Food May Be Shrinking, Weakening Teeth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teeth are getting smaller, but don't go
measuring your children _ or even your great-grandchildren.
   The change is about 1 percent per 1,000 years, according to
University of Michigan anthropologist C. Loring Brace, who
attributes the shrinkage to better food preparation techniques
putting softer food in our mouths.
   Teeth have shrunk about 50 percent in 100,000 years, and twice
as fast in the last 10,000 years, says Brace, who has studied teeth
for 25 years.
   ``The advent of earth ovens, pottery and other utensils has
played a direct role,'' he says. Ancient cemeteries contain many
bodies with no teeth where earthen ovens were common; in areas with
ovens, there are more teeth.
   ``As softer cooked foods became available, our ancestors had
less need of big strong teeth to survive,'' he says.

<HEAD>Work on Honeycombed Blank for Telescope Mirror Ready for Polishing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 11{-foot-wide honeycombed piece of glass
made with a new casting process has been sent off for a year of
grinding and polishing into a mirror officials hope will lead to
cheaper, more powerful telescopes.
   The last molding material was flushed off the glass blank with a
high-pressure water hose on Aug. 11, and University of Arizona
spokeswoman Jan McCoy said, ``It's a perfect piece of glass.
   Astronomers unveiled the blank in June when they removed the lid
of a its furnace after letting it cool for weeks after it was
spun-cast centrifugally in a new process that creates a lighter,
more deeply curved mirror.
   ``This first one has been a great success,'' McCoy said.
   Grinding and polishing will take about a year, then the mirror
will go into the Apache Point Observatory planned for the
Sacramento Mountains near Sunspot, N.M. It will be operated by the
Astrophysical Research Consortium of Princeton, Chicago, New Mexico
State, Washington and Washington State universities.
   Work already has begun at the Mirror Laboratory here on a second
blank, identical to the first, for another consortium. Once that
blank is completed, the furnace is to be expanded for casting of a
nearly 21{-foot blank to upgrade the Multiple Mirror Telescope on
Mount Hopkins south of Tucson.

<HEAD>Researchers Hope to Use Lightning to Predict Storms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Hurricane Center is
counting lightning strokes to see if they could lead to better
thunderstorm warnings, but one meteorologist says such warnings
could be too late to do any good.
   A correlation between the the severity of a storm and the
number, frequency and intensity of lightning before it would let
forecasters issue more timely and accurate warnings, said Bob
Pifer, a meteorologist at the center.
   The equipment for comparison has been available for years, but
Florida has been slow to use the information for weather
prediction, he said. ``Specialized users like electric companies,
forestry services or power generation plants are more concerned
with lightning than the general public.''
   ``In Florida, we have fairly short-lived storms. They usually
start to dissipate in 30 to 45 minutes,'' said National Weather
Service meteorologist Gordon McCann in West Palm Beach. By the time
enough lightning strokes to make the prediction are recorded, it
could be too late for warnings, he said.
   The Hurricane Center gets its data from receivers in
Jacksonville, Tampa, Palm Bay, Fort Lauderdale and Naples, run by
Atmospheric Research Systems Inc. of Palm Bay, where a computer
records the information.

   A 2-year-old girl lies in a hospital
room suffering from a rare, incurable blood disorder that involves
painful treatment.
   In another room, relatives of a 56-year-old comatose woman
recall her wish not to be kept alive with no hope of recovery.
   Two patients. Two medical histories. But each poses ethics
questions, which have U.S. hospitals turning more frequently to
special consultants and committees to help search for the answers.
   The American Hospital Association estimates that at least 60
percent of the nation's hospitals with 200 or more beds have such
committees.
   A few, such as Lutheran General Hospital in this north Chicago
suburb, have doctors like John La Puma, who serve as ethics
consultants.
   La Puma, the first graduate of the University of Chicago's
Pritzker School of Medicine with a fellowship in ethics, is both a
doctor and a teacher, trying to balance the complexity of medical
technology with patient care.
   ``Clinical medicine has within it a great deal of humanity that
has been de-emphasized with the development of technology. It's
simply time for us to look back at our values of caring and balance
them with those of curing,'' he said.
   In last week's Journal of the American Medical Association, an
issue that focused on medical ethics, Dr. Julia E. Connelly of the
University of Virginia reported on a study of 212 women and 68 men
who visited a doctor's office run by the school in Charlottesville
from November 1983 to July 1984.
   Eighty-four patients, or 30 percent, presented ethical problems
ranging from refusing treatment to confidentiality and the cost of
care.
   La Puma, a hospital staff member, does at least two
consultations a week, mostly triggered by doctors, nurses, lawyers
or hospital administrators.
   One involved Evelyn Jendrzejyk, a 2-year-old suffering from a
rare, fatal blood disorder who had been hospitalized 18 times since
birth. Doctors wanted to use painful kidney dialysis and a machine
to help Evelyn breathe, but her parents questioned the benefits.
   ``I felt that each treatment should be evaluated for how much
burden it caused the baby and the parents. These parents take their
job as parents very seriously,'' said La Puma, who recommended
against the machines. He suggested a long-term care plan that would
include simpler treatment involving the use of fluids, with the
goal of relieving Evelyn's pain.
   So far, Evelyn hasn't needed the dialysis or mechanical
ventilator. She has gone home and is doing fine, La Puma said.
   ``He definitely opened our eyes to all the options,'' said her
mother, Lisa Jendrzejyk. ``He was very thorough with us, real
understanding and supportive.''
   In another case, a comatose 56-year-old woman's cirrhosis of the
liver was complicated by stomach bleeding that required her to
receive three pints of blood a day. La Puma declined to identify
the woman.
   Relatives and doctors discussed discontinuing treatment. She
once said she didn't want to live without hope of recovery and
because it was thought she might die her her daily transfusions, in
effect, were a waste of blood.
   Although there was little medical research available on her
prognosis, La Puma said, ``I thought we should give her the benefit
of the doubt.''
   Treatment continued and the woman revived enough to leave her
bed. When the bleeding resumed, she was able to tell doctors in
writing that she wanted to continue treatment to spend time with
her family. She died a few days later.
   ``You have to let patients tell you what the issues are,'' La
Puma said. ``Out of the details of their own medical situation and
their own values come the ethical issues that are important to
them. Putting that all together, medically and ethically, makes a
whole.''
   An ethics consultant helps clarify issues and also ``provides a
lot of comfort for myself as a primary care physician,'' said Dr.
Stuart Goldman, director of research and family practice at
Lutheran General.
   In addition to medicine's capacity to prolong life, ``in a
society where lawsuits are common, lawsuits are less likely when an
ethics committee has been consulted,'' said Dr. David Larson,
director of Loma Linda University's Center for Christian Bioethics
in California. ``It's harder to demonstrate that a doctor has acted
unprofessionally. It's the basic idea that two heads are better
than one in a terminal situation.''
   Consultants' recommendations aren't binding, said Dr. Henry
Perkins, an assistant professor of medicine and ethics consultant
at two teaching hospitals associated with the University of Texas.
However, in almost all the cases he consulted on during 1{ years in
1984 and 1985, doctors said it ``increased their confidence in
caring for the patient.''
   La Puma evaluated a formal ethics consultation service
established in 1986 at the University of Chicago Hospitals and
Clinics. He reported in JAMA's issue on ethics that 45 doctors
requested consultations for 51 patients and that in 36 cases, they
found the consultation ``very important'' in patient care.
   In 96 percent of the cases, doctors indicated they planned to
request an ethics consultation in the future.
   Years ago, Perkins said, the family doctor often discussed
ethical issues in patient care. But technology has changed all
that, and he believes the need for ethics consultants, especially
those trained in medicine, will grow.
   Not all ethics consultants are doctors. Many ethics committee
members are philosophers, theologians and social workers. That
raises other issues.
   Among them, according to Arthur L. Caplan, director of the
Center for Biomedical Ethics at the University of Minnesota: ``Who
should be entitled to do this and what qualifications and training
should they have? What are the proper duties to give to someone who
is an ethics consultant _ teaching, troubleshooting, or
policy-making? What is the job?''
   Most of La Puma's training is clinical, but he studied social
science, health policy, and medical arts history and took informal
courses in law and ethics. He also asks lawyers, philosophers and
others for advice.
   ``The field is so new. We actually should be talking about what
makes up a good ethics consultation. The battle over who should do
it is a turf battle.''
   Another unresolved issue is consultants' legal responsibility,
said Caplan. ``I think, down the road, the courts are going to have
to clarify their role.''
   Many ethical debates now center around ending or withholding
treatment, but La Puma believes as doctors develop guidelines that
may be easier to resolve.
   ``I think the big ethical issue of the 1990s is going to be
medical indigents,'' he said, ``and what kind of care we provide
for patients who cannot provide for themselves.''

<HEAD>Cornell Ornithology Center Is Nest Of Information For Birders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM KATES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Some professional birdwatchers look down on
amateurs, but the legacy of America's first ornithology professor
unites their work.
   Cornell University's Laboratory of Ornithology, which owes its
creation to Arthur A. Allen, contains millions of pages of behavior
studies and photographs and the world's largest collection of
birdsongs _ more than 5,000 species.
   Equally important, it links ornithologists and amateur
birdwatchers. ``The game is to position the laboratory between the
professional community and the birding community, the amateur and
the professional,'' said executive director Charles Walcott. ``We
are an information broker between the two.''
   ``Cornell is synonomous with ornithology in the minds of
birdwatchers,'' said Elsa Thompson, co-publisher of Birdwatchers
Digest. ``They are greatly respected as a technical and research
facility.
   ``But Cornell has also managed to serve as a popular outreach,
helping bridge the gap between professional and amateur.''
   Allen, an expert on red-winged blackbirds and pioneer in
recording and filming wild birds, headed North America's only
doctoral program in ornithology from the 1920s to the '40s. He
fashioned a first-rate program at Cornell. But it was Lyman K.
Stuart, a business graduate, who helped make the lab in Sapsucker
Woods, a 180-acre sanctuary outside Ithaca, a reality.
   Stuart, who won a ``Life'' magazine contest with the bird
photography Allen taught him, financed much of the construction.
   The main building holds the largest collection of works by bird
artist Louis Agassiz Fuertes. A floor-to-ceiling window overlooks a
10-acre pond, so visitors can watch feeder birds and waterfowl and
listen to sounds piped in by microphones installed outside.
   During Allen's lifetime _ he died in 1964 _ the laboratory
gained international recognition, but his continued connections
with amateurs and volunteer conservationists were frowned upon by
the new breed of professional ornithologists. In response, the
university made the lab a separate department, but without
professors or course offerings and with no students of its own.
   It was expected to support itself financially, and generates
money through dues and project fees, sale of publications and bird
recordings, and home-study courses in ornithology and bird
photography.
   Membership dropped so low by 1980 that Cornell seriously
considered shutting down the lab. Walcott, who earned a reputation
as an educational promoter developing public television science
shows like ``Nova'' and ``3-2-1 Contact,'' has boosted its
membership from 2,000 to 13,000 in eight years and rejuventated its
home-study enrollment to about 9,000.
   ``Now that we have become stable again we are turning our
attention to our research efforts and producing a tremendous
scientific archive,'' he said. ``Of course, all we do here has
really one focus _ conservation. The information we collect is
highly useful as an environmental monitoring tool and we hope will
serve as a biological early warning system.''
   Its foremost study is in bioacoustics, or bird communication.
``With the help of computers we are making progress in finding out
what birds say to each other, and they do communicate,'' said Chris
Clark, head of the program.
   The research has led to similar efforts involving whales and
elephants.
   The lab's 1-year-old Project FeederWatch last year paid 4,000
backyard birdwatchers to fill out a computerized form twice weekly
recording the species that appear at their feeders. The goal this
year is 10,000, and Walcott notes there are more than 82 million
Americans who put out food for wild birds.
   ``We can only begin to guess at what we might have been able to
accomplish if we had had this kind of information years ago,'' he
said, ``how many extinct species we could have saved.''

   Business inventories climbed for the 18th
consecutive month in June, the government said, prompting some
economists to warn that companies may be stockpiling goods in
anticipation of higher prices.
   The Commerce Department said Friday that inventories jumped 0.7
percent to a seasonally adjusted $733.9 billion in June, following
an identical 0.7 percent rise in May. Inventory levels have not
fallen since December 1986.
   Business sales surged 1.5 percent in June to $490.6 billion
following a 0.8 percent gain in May. It was the fifth month without

   The dollar eased today and share prices firmed in
extremely thin trading as a summer Buddhist holiday and the
expected announcement of U.S. trade figures kept investors out of
the stock markets.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
48.53 points Friday, edged up 67.78 points or 0.24 percent today to
close at 27,901.29.
   Volume on the first section was 230 million shares, the lowest
full-day level this year. Until today, the lowest volume of the
year was 380 million shares on Jan. 11.
   ``Nearly the whole exchange is on vacation and hardly anyone is

speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``Even less than nothing is going on,'' said another.
   Many non-financial businesses were closed for Obon, an annual
holiday period during which Japanese honor their ancestors.
   Dealers also said investors were waiting on the sidelines for
the expected announcement Tuesday in Washington of U.S. trade
figures for June.
   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at
132.95 yen, down 0.10 yen from its close Friday. It ranged from a
low of 132.65 yen and a high of 133.05.

   The dollar was mixed in quiet European trading
this morning as the market waited for the release of the latest
U.S. trade figures to provide a fresh indication of the strength of
the U.S. economy.
   Gold prices fell.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar was slightly below last
week's closing levels against the French franc and West German
mark, but was rising in general.
   They said the market was likely to trade in a narrow range until
the release of June U.S. trade figures on Tuesday.
   ``We are in a breather phase right now, which will last until
the markets have the force to start up again,'' said one dealer at
a U.S. bank in Frankfurt. ``But for that, we need the (trade)
data.''
   Italian financial markets were closed today for a holiday.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.8785 West German marks, down from 1.8805; 1.5758
Swiss francs, up from 1.5750; 6.3775 French francs, down from
6.3810; 2.1194 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1146; 1.2195 Canadian
dollars, unchanged.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar closed at 132.95 yen, down 0.10 yen from Friday's close.
Later, in London, it was quoted at 132.98 yen.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.7135, weaker than
$1.7155 Friday.
   Gold opened in London at $431.40 a troy ounce and the city's
five major bullion dealers later fixed a recommended price of
$431.15. Both were down slightly from late Friday's bid of $431.50.
   In Zurich, gold was selling at a bid $430.125, down from
Friday's $432.50.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $433.80, up from
Saturday's finish of 430.68.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.71 a troy
ounce, down from Friday's 6.73.

<HEAD>For American Business Overseas, Rule No. 1 is Mind Your Manners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department has long advised
prospective exporters to do their homework, mind their manners and
refrain from breaking cultural taboos if they want to sell American
products overseas.
   A private trade expert has given USDA a hand in advising
would-be exporters on how to behave _ such as not putting your
drink on the desk of a London executive while chatting about
business.
   John W. Bing, president of International Training Associates of
Princeton, Princeton, N.J., said the British manager ``probably
will refrain from calling the bobbies'' if you put a coffee or tea
mug on his desk. But, after all, it just isn't done.
   Bing talks about doing business overseas in a forthcoming issue
of Foreign Agriculture magazine, which is published by the
department's Foreign Agricultural Service.
   Leading off, he recalls an old story about the cultural
differences among Americans, Germans, French and Russians.
   ``In America, everything is permitted that is not forbidden,''
Bing said. ``In Germany, everything is forbidden that is not
permitted. In France, everything is permitted, even if it is
forbidden. And in Russia, everything is forbidden, even if it is
permitted.''
   Bing noted, however, that in these days of ``glasnost,'' or
openness, the Soviet description probably should be updated to
``almost everything is forbidden, even if it is permitted.''
   The serious side is that when people do business internationally
they should learn not only about the legal, financial and technical
dimensions of dealing in the marketplace, but also about the people
with whom they are dealing.
   ``You don't have to go native, or lose your character, to be a
successful entrepreneur overseas,'' Bing said. ``In fact, you
shouldn't. But you do need to have the capacity to understand your
customers' needs, your international partners' concerns and your
competitors' strengths.''
   An important first step is ``to be accepted'' by foreign buyers,
he said. In most countries, doing business ``involves a higher
level of trust'' than in the United States, Bing added.
   That is probably because Americans put their trust in the legal
contract and in the courts.
   ``Perhaps that's why there are more lawyers in New Jersey than
there are in all of Japan,'' he said. ``That's also why developing
personal relationships with potential customers is so important.''
   Some U.S. food and agricultural products sell well in different
foreign cultures without being changed. However, there are some
that require modification.
   ``Coca-Cola has been successful in almost every country of the
world, and so have Kellogg's Corn Flakes,'' Bing said. ``But
General Mills had a hard time introducing cake mixes to England,
and Campbell's also was unable to launch their canned soups in
European markets until they were reformulated to meet European
tastes.''
   Some advertising agencies may say a product's message can be
taken worldwide without changing it.
   ``Well, almost,'' Bing said. ``You might have to change the
language _ and perhaps the medium from TV to billboards or to
newspapers.''
   In many cases, a nation's culture determines what are perceived
as desirable qualities of a product.
   ``For example, a study was made of what people in the United
States, Great Britain, Brazil and India saw as desirable attributes
of toothpaste,'' he said. ``The results showed that U.S. consumers
preferred a refreshing taste, the French wanted one that would kill
germs, the Indians wanted it to appeal to children, and the
Brazilians cared about its color and whether or not the tube
squeezed easily.''
   In another instance, the successful introduction of a
Pennsylvania Dutch-type of cookie into Japan followed market
research showing that Japanese consumers preferred a more glazed
finish, a smaller cookie with different spices, and more elegant
packaging.
   ``The business person who launched this product in Japan did his
homework, and his cookie is selling,'' Bing said.
   Different economic climates also can have an impact on a
product's pricing strategy.
   ``For example, if you are selling a product in Brazil or another
country with a rapid rate of inflation, be prepared to change your
prices monthly, sometimes weekly,'' Bing said.

<HEAD>65 Percent of American Households Now Have VCRs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Video cassette recorders, compact disc
players, camcorders and other consumer electronics products are
becoming standard fare in the American home, according to a Gallup
survey.
   These products are no longer just symbols of an affluent singles
lifestyle but are finding their way into the homes of families with
children, says the Electronic Industries Association's Consumer
Electronics Group, which commissioned the study.
   ``People always think of these as yuppie products, and they're
not,'' said Cynthia Saraniti, a spokeswoman for the electronics
group.
   The VCR is the fastest growing product in the $41-billion-a-year
consumer electronics industry, she said. The number of households
with a VCR has been climbing at 10 percent to 12 percent a year and
sales are expected to top 13 million this year, she said.
   The survey of 1,008 adults found that 65 percent of the
households polled had a VCR. By household composition, VCR
ownership was 40 percent among single adults, 63 percent among
households of two or more adults, and 78 percent among couples with
children.
   The survey was conducted by telephone last spring by the Gallup
Organization. The results have a sampling error of plus or minus 4
percentage points.
   The next most popular product was a pair of speakers for audio
playback, an item claimed by 40 percent of the households overall.
Some 26 percent said they had an electronic typewriter, 24 percent
said they had a telephone answering machine, 18 percent had a
personal computer, 14 percent had a compact disc player and 8
percent had a camcorder, according to the survey.
   In all of the product categories, the ownership percentages for
couples with children were higher than for single adults: 47
percent compared with 25 percent for audio speakers; 32 percent
compared with 14 percent for electronic typewriters, 24 percent
compared with 18 percent for telephone answering machines, 24
percent compared with 8 percent for personal computers, 15 percent
compared with 10 percent for compact disc players, and 13 percent
compared with 3 percent for camcorders.
   Though the prices of most consumer electronics products have
dropped since they were first introduced, income is still a
determining factor in purchases _ the higher a household's income,
the more likely it is to have one of these products.
   In households with income over $60,000 a year, 88 percent said
they had a VCR, compared with 49 percent of households earning
under $20,000, the survey found. The disparity was more apparent
with personal computers, which were in 46 percent of the
higher-income households compared with 10 percent of the
lower-income homes, and camcorders, 25 percent compared with 3
percent.
   Portable stereo units known as ``boom boxes'' were the most
popular audio equipment, owned by 48 percent of those surveyed.
Smaller radio-tape players with headphones were owned by 40 percent.
   Nearly every household _ 99 percent _ had a television set,
according to the survey, and predictably the more people in the
household, the more TV sets there are likely to be.
   About half of the single adults said they had one set, about a
third had two sets and 14 percent reported three or more. In
households with children, 43 percent had three or more TV sets, 31
percent had two and 26 percent had just one.

<HEAD>Report Cites Labor Shortage in Washington Area</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Washington area has a labor shortage but
it can be reduced by creation of support systems giving people more
incentive and opportunity to work, according to a study released
Monday.
   The report from the Greater Washington Research Center cites
strong growth in the area's private sector, in part fueled by
federal contracting, as the reason for the region's booming economy
and consequently low unemployment.
   Recent figures have put area unemployment at 2.7 percent,
described by economists as a ``frictional'' rate because most
unemployed workers are in the processs of switching jobs rather
than looking for them.
   In addition to private sector growth, the area's growing
importance in high-tech, international and regional development is
a strong impetus to local economic development, according to author
George Grier.
   ``Washington is becoming the hub of an emerging mega-metropolis
that has become identified as the `Chesapeake Crescent,''' which
combines the economic power of the Baltimore, Washington, Richmond
and Norfolk-Newport News areas, Grier said.
   But it also faces problems recruiting workers, Grier says, as
housing costs increase and commuting distances lengthen, Grier says.
   ``Many people who might otherwise consider locating in the
greater Washington area find themselves priced out of the market,''
he says.
   Making better use of resident resources could add up to 300,000
people to the current labor force, Grier says.
   Support systems to compensate for special needs, such as
flexible and part-time schedules, could attract retired people who
otherwise might not want to work, according to the report.
   In addition, providing child care facilities would allow mothers
on welfare and other non-working mothers more freedom to work, the
study says.

   Australia and New Zealand will move
closer to full economic union Friday with the signing of an
agreement designed to end all trade barriers within five years.
   Prime Minister David Lange of New Zealand, who arrived in
Australia for a weeklong visit today, also has suggested the

points us in the direction of a combined ... fleet,'' he was quoted

Closer Economic Relations agreement in Canberra on Friday.
   The new agreement will end all trade barriers and unify business
law and customs procedures by 1993. It also calls for greater
controls on illegal immigration and drug trafficking.
   Since the first Closer Economic Relations agreement in 1983
relaxed tariff barriers, trade between the two countries has
doubled.
   New Zealand is Australia's third largest market with exports
valued at $1.68 billion. Australia is New Zealand's second largest
market with exports of $1.2 billion.
   Lange has said the new Australian-New Zealand market would not
be as restrictive a trading bloc as the European Economic Community.

   Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch household products
group, said Monday its second-quarter net profit jumped 11 percent,
with most lines of business contributing to the improvement.
   Unilever, whose brands include Lever, Lipton, and
Chesebrough-Pond's, said net profit in the three months ended June
30 rose to $371 million, or 20 cents a share, compared with $367
million, or 19.8 cents a share in the same period a year earlier.
   Sales gained 5 percent to $8.25 billion, from $7.84 billion in
the year-earlier period.
   ``The second quarter showed a stronger improvement over 1987
than that achieved in the first quarter,'' said Michael Angus,
chairman of the company's British arm, Unilever PLC. ``Most parts
of the business contributed to this result.''
   ``The outlook for the year as a whole is encouraging,'' the
chairman added.
   For the first six months of the year, net profit rose 8 percent
to $685 million, or 37 cents a share, from $696 million, or 38
cents a share in the first half of last year.
   Sales increased 4 percent to $15.9 billion, from $15.4 billion.

   Enzo Ferrari, Italy's greatest sports car
builder and racing pioneer, died at his home in Modena, his auto
company announced today. He was 90.
   In a statement, the company said, ``Enzo Ferrari serenely ended
his earthly life Sunday, Aug. 14.'' No cause of death was given,
but Ferrari was known to suffer from a kidney disease.
   At Ferrari's side when he died were his son Piero and Piero's
wife, Floriana, the statement said. Piero's mother, Lina, who was
not Ferrari's wife, was also at the deathbed. His wife had died in
1978.
   At Ferrari's request, the announcement of his death was made
after the private funeral rites and burial today in San Cataldo,
near this northern city, according to the ANSA news agency.
   The founder and chairman of the company that bears his name and
makes luxury sports cars and Formula One racers once dreamed of
becoming an opera star or a sportswriter.
   But his first love was automobiles, and his drivers whipped the
prancing black horse that decorates his bright red racing cars to
victory on every major track in the world.
   ``It's true that I have never met any man whom I thought
altogether resembled me _ but only because my faults are so
enormous,'' he wrote in his autobiography.
   ``I have yet to meet anyone quite so stubborn as myself and
animated by this overpowering passion that leaves me no time for
thought or anything else. I have in fact no interest in life
outside racing cars,'' he wrote. ``I have never gone on a real
trip, never taken a holiday. The best holiday for me is spent in my
workshops when nearly everybody else is on vacation.''
   His factory, in the town of Maranello, near Modena, turns out
about 1,300 cars a year. Hundreds of customers, book the Ferrari
models years in advance and pay as much as $150,000, and more, for
the cars.
   Born in February 1898, Ferrari entered motor racing in 1919 and
drove with the Alfa Romeo team for 11 years. But he never became a
great driver because of a fatal flaw _ he could not bear to ruin an
engine to win a race.
   Ferrari founded his Maranello auto works in 1946, letting other
men win races in cars he produced.
   At the time, about 400 workers toiled painstakingly on the
silvery engines. Some crankshafts were sculpted by hand out of
steel, each requiring more than 80 hours of work.
   His drivers drove the racers to more than 4,000 victories and
the Ferrari team picked up 13 world titles, including nine in the
Formula One category since 1952.
   Ferrari was forced to reduce his business activities in February
when he developed influenza.
   Last month, a company spokesman confirmed that Ferrari was being
treated at home for kidney troubles and ``for ailments typical of
his age.''
   Ferrari was an avowed agnostic who made no secret of his
aversion for the Vatican, which had criticized him for his stoic
attitude toward the deaths of his drivers in fiery accidents on the
track.
   However, in June, Pope John Paul II toured the company's plant,
took a spin in one of the sports cars and spoke by phone for five
minutes with the bed-ridden Ferrari.

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Monday abolished the state
tourism directorate and said major hotels, restaurants and other
facilities will be sold off or leased to the private sector.
   A decree by the ruling Revolution Command Council said the
state-run assets to be privatized included seven major hotels in
Baghdad, the war-battered southern port city of Basra and the
northern city of Mosul, including two Sheratons.
   The Basra Sheraton was damaged by shell and rocket fire during a
major Iranian offensive against Basra in early 1987, in which some
of the heaviest fighting in the nearly 8-year-old Gulf war took
place.
   Monday's announcement came as Iranian and Iraqi leaders prepared
to meet in Geneva Aug. 25 for peace talks under United Nations
auspices.
   The Iraqi move to sell off its tourist facilities is part of
President Saddam Hussein's drive to develop his socialist-run
country's private sector by selling off state-owned assets to
stimulate the economy, badly battered by the war with neighboring
Iran.
   No statistics were immediately available, but tourism to Iraq,
rich in archaeological sites dating back at least 6,000 years, has
been badly affected by the conflict.
   The hotels will still be run by their parent chains in
accordance with an agreement signed with the Iraqi government,
officials said.
   But managers at the hotels said they did not yet know if the
facilities will be sold to Iraq's private sector or be handed over
to their parent companies.
   According to the RCC decision, taken Aug. 2 but only announced
Monday, those hotels which will not be sold will be leased for 25
years to private companies.
   The decree said a special commission will supervise the sale or
lease of the state-owned utilities, which also include a tourist
complex in Habaniya west of Baghdad and several modern resort
complexes in the northern mountains, scene of heavy fighting in the
war.

   Months after white collar workers at Harvard
University voted to unionize, a tense labor battle continues, with
the Ivy League school being accused of union-busting as its seeks
to throw out the vote.
   A National Labor Relations Board administrative law judge was
scheduled to open hearings today on Harvard's challenge of the May
17 vote that created a 3,300-member union. The hearings are
expected to take two weeks.
   Harvard alleges that organizers used illegal tactics, including
intimidation of opponents and electioneering at the polls, to win
the election by 44 votes, 1,530 to 1,486.
   The university wants the agency to invalidate the election.
   Officials at the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers
deny the charges. ``What's really going on here is we beat them,
and they know it, and everybody knows it,'' said Kristine A.
Rondeau, an organizer.
   ``Our union is now a permanent part of Harvard University, and
the only remaining question is, what's the future relationship
going to be _ peace or war? Harvard's got to decide,'' she said.
   Harvard administrator Anne Taylor, who coordinated the
university's response to the union, conceded that the school ``is
in a difficult position'' because ``it's a liberal institution''
and ``the administration of the university is not reflexively
anti-union and would not like to be thought of as reflexively
anti-union.''
   Joel Harmetz, an administrative law judge from Washington, D.C.,
who is conducting the hearings, is not likely to reach a decision
until mid-autumn, said Joseph L. Kane, supervisory examiner in the
NLRB's Boston office.
   The union drive, which began in 1975, was closely watched by
national labor leaders as a bellwether for organizing white-collar
workers.
   Taylor said administrators believe there is ``strong evidence''
that union organizers acted improperly during the election.
   She said the violations include ``the union's maintenance of
lists on which they checked off voters, their interrogation of
voters as to how they voted, the escorting of voters to the polls,
electioneering on the way to the polls and at the polls, and the
providing of things of value _ such as medical care and plane fares
_ to get union supporters to vote.''
   Rondeau said the union conducted a legitimate get-out-the-vote
operation, and nothing more.
   ``They're saying we were at the polls keeping lists, and we were
not,'' she said. ``They're saying we were intimidating people.
That's incredible, no matter how much you stretch it.''

<TEXT>
   An antiques dealer says he intends to
keep the 24-inch doll he purchased for $48,000, a U.S. record.
   Richard Wright of Birch Runville, Pa., bought the ceramic German
doll, with blue-gray eyes, during an auction here Saturday.
   The previous U.S. record for a doll was $45,000 paid for a 19th
century French doll sold at a Los Angeles auction two years ago.
   Wright's boy doll, which sports a top hat, is known as a Kammer
and Reinhardt Model 106. It was made about 1910 from bisque ceramic.
   ``I bought him because I've been collecting the Kammer and
Reinhardt series for 25 years,'' said the 41-year-old Wright.
   George Theriault, who conducted the auction, said the doll had
been expected to sell for about $25,000.
   ``That was exciting,'' Theriault said. ``It was nothing we
anticipated.''
   He said the price was a U.S. record, but well below the more
than $100,000 paid last year for an 18th century doll in England.
   The doll was owned by the late Lucy Earle, who a Pacific
Palisades antiques collector. Officials said the auction raised
$125,000 for a California Institute of the Arts scholarship fund.
Last year, more than 300 dolls, including Model 106, were donated
to the institute by Mrs. Earle's estate.

<TEXT>
   Peasants in southern China have cut down and
stolen more than 10,000 trees from a state-run forest since the
beginning of the year, an official newspaper said.
   The Legal Daily said Monday that illegal logging has been
increasing at the Wugong Mountain forest in Jiangxi province
because forestry officials refuse to punish the peasants.
   The report said in the past peasants used to sneak up the
mountain and cut one or two trees down. Now, it said, ``they steal
dozens of trees and even hundreds of trees at a time.''
   The peasants use the wood to build houses and for fuel.
   On April 19, the paper said, 2,000 peasants from a nearby
village looted more than 200 cubic yards of trees. Five days later,
peasants again entered the forest and cut down trees. This time
forestry guards were injured, the paper said.
   The report said the Wugong Mountain forest has 49,444 acres of
trees and is one of the country's main producers of wood products.
   The Chinese press has said that illegal logging poses serious
problems for the environment and the development of agriculture.
Illegal logging quickens soil erosion and creates conditions where
small amounts of rain can cause major floods.
   Last year, 247,100 acres of forests in China were destroyed by
illegal logging and 91 million yuan, or about $24.5 million, in
trees were stolen, the China Daily reported in March.
   Monday's report said the problem could not be solved in Jiangxi
province because officials there are too lenient.

<HEAD>Government Announces Second Phase of Anti-Inflation Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has announced it is extending
an emergency inflation-busting program until Nov. 30, President
Miguel de la Madrid's last day in office.
   A statement released by the president's office Sunday night said
the government would maintain its 6-month-old freeze on the peso
currency exchange rate and prices for government-regulated goods
and services through the end of the administration.
   The government said it would not increase the federal minimum
wage, also frozen since Feb. 29. But it said the national sales tax
for processed foods and medicines, as well as taxes on rents, would
be lowered in some cases to bolster workers' real income.
   Implemented in December, the first phase of the so-called
Economic Solidarity Pact between the government, labor and business
sectors expires Aug. 31. The new measures announced Sunday go into
effect Sept. 1.
   ``What we have achieved with the Economic Solidarity Pact is not
artificial, nor is it casual, nor has it responded to immediate
political objectives,'' de la Madrid said at a ceremony attended by
members of his cabinet and the heads of leading business and labor
organizations at the presidential residence.
   The program was unveiled as Mexico's inflation rate was soaring
to a record 159.2 percent in 1987. On Aug. 10, the central Bank of
Mexico announced the Pact had succeeded in bringing consumer prices
down to a 1.7 percent increase in July, the lowest monthly rise in
seven years.
   Inflation for the first seven months of the year reached 43.3
percent, while the annual rate between July 1987 and July was 122.3
percent, the central bank said.
   The measures announced on Sunday include:
   _Prices for gasoline, telephone service, natural gas,
electricity and other goods and services sold by the government
will remain stable;
   _The peso exchange rate with the U.S. dollar will remain frozen;
   _The government will reduce its Value Added Tax from six to zero
percent on processed foods and medicines, with retailers required
to pass the savings on to consumers;
   _The daily minimum wage, currently about $3.50 in the Federal
District of Mexico City, will remain frozen;
   _Taxes on rents will be reduced for those workers earning less
than four times the daily minimum wage;
   _By Sept. 1, retailers will be obliged to lower prices for their
goods an average of 3 percent compared to prices in effect between
July 7 and August 7.
   De la Madrid said the government would continue its attempts to
alleviate shortages in certain goods, such as meats, that have
appeared since the officially voluntary pact went into effect.
   But he warned the government ``will not abandon the use of
instruments and responsibilities of authority in necessary cases''
to enforce compliance with price guidelines, the statement said.
   ``The final objective of the fight against inflation is to reach
rates of price increases similar to those of our principal trade
partners,'' de la Madrid said.
   The timing of the announcement was important for the president,
economists here agreed. The government wanted to stop costly
speculation that it planned to devalue the peso against the dollar.
On the controlled market last week, the peso traded at 2,241 to buy
and 2,273 to sell.
   The announcement also provides two weeks' lead time for reaction
to subside before de la Madrid gives his final state of the nation
speech on Sept. 1.
   The president is virtually certain to be replaced by Carlos
Salinas de Gortari, his former planning and budget minister, on
Dec. 1.
   The 3-month extension of the minimum wage freeze and lowering of
retail prices represented a compromise by both government and labor.
   Only Saturday, Jorge Sanchez, president of the umbrella Labor
Congress, said his organization would not abide by a renewal of the
pact unless the government either raised salaries to compensate for
inflation since February or forced the private sector to reduce its
retail prices.
   Sunday's presidential statement quoted Sanchez as saying the
pact's second phase provided ``a greater protection for the real
salary of the workers.''

<HEAD>Peabody Coal lays off 128 workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAIRVIEW HEIGHTS, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Peabody Coal Co. has laid off
128 more employees from one of its operations in this St. Clair
County community, reducing the company's work force to only 32.
   Of the 128 workers laid off Friday, 50 were laid off
indefinitely, while the 78 others were offered new jobs or
transfers to other Peabody operations.
   The layoffs bring to 540 the number of local workers eliminated
in the past three years.
   Peabody Coal, a wholly owned subsidiary of Peabody Holding Co.,
operates 40 surface and underground mines in nine states.
   Another 85 administrative and clerical workers throughout the
company were also laid off.
   The latest layoffs occurred because of a reduced demand for
high-sulfur Illinois coal, said company spokesman Ron Greenfield.
Large users of coal have continued to switch to other forms of
energy such as nuclear energy or use lower-sulfur coal from western
or eastern states, he said.
   ``We have reduced the number of employees at the mine level over
the past several years in response to the highly competitive market
for coal,'' company president Howard W. Williams said Friday in a
statement.
   ``The layoffs bring our support staff more in line with the
current active mining employee levels within these operations,'' he
said.
   Further layoffs will depend on government regulation, Greenfield
said.
   High-sulfur coal contributes pollutants to the air that need to
be reduced in order to comply with federal clean air legislation,
he said.
   ``Further tightening of clean-air legislation will not help,''
Greenfield said.
   In October 1985, Peabody Holding Co. laid off 100 management
employees at what was then its St. Louis headquarters and 70 people
in its Illinois Division, which includes the Fairview Heights
office.
   The company's headquarters was moved in April 1986 to Henderson,
Ky.
   A total of 151 miners were laid off at two Belleville-area mines
in 1987.
   The company's Illinois Division office is responsible for seven
mines _ six in Illinois, with four in the Belleville area, and one
in Oklahoma.
   At the end of 1987, those mines employed 2,844 and produced 10.8
million tons of coal, Greenfield said. That was down from 4,890
employees and coal production of 16 million tons of coal from 15
mines three years ago.

<HEAD>City Preparing $500 Million Gamble to Incinerate Garbage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Critics of a new $500 million Chicago garbage
incineration and electrical generation plan are pointing out that
other cities have canceled similar plans worth an estimated $4
billion in the last 18 months.
   ``The technology itself is a dog,'' complained one critic, Brian
Lipsett of the Citizens Clearinghouse for Hazardous Waste.
   Despite uneven success with such garbage power plants, including
two already built in the city, proponents say as many as 10
incinerators would be built under the plan, which also calls for
the city to sell the steam and electricity produced to defray costs.
   Lipsett and other critics contend that garbage plants emit
cancer-causing chemicals and produce tons of ash laden with poisons
such as lead and arsenic, and that taxpayers routinely get burned
because such incinerators run over budget, break down repeatedly
and fail to meet optimistic projections on how much revenue they
will generate.
   Industry officials, however, counter by pointing to the success
of a $288 million, state-of-the-art incinerator now operating in
Bridgeport, Conn., that has helped that city avert a garbage crisis.
   ``You'll find success stories where projects have come in under
budget and ahead of schedule and have operated as designed,'' said
Jack Lyman, spokesman for the Solid Waste Management Association.
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says 140 municipal
garbage incinerators are operating and that another 200 are planned.
   Chicago now buries about 85 percent of its garbage _ about three
million tons annually _ in landfills. About 13 percent is
incinerated at Chicago's one working plant on the Northwest Side
and the remainder is recycled.
   But with the Illinois EPA estimating landfills will be full by
1991, the city has turned its attention to waste-to-energy plants.
   The city plan calls for as much as 55 percent of Chicago's waste
to be burned by the year 2000 at between two and 10 plants,
depending on the size of each. An 18-month study already is
underway to determine how to pay for those plants and where they
should be located.
   The city, meanwhile, has had mixed results with incinerators.
   The Northwest Side facility has burned garbage 24 hours a day
for 17 years, consuming about 1,000 tons a day, and producing
industrial steam that's sold to a candy company nearby for $1
million a year.
   But a second plant on the Southwest Side, built at a cost of $27
million, was mothballed in 1979 after only 1{ years of irregular
service.
   Mayoral aide Leroy Bannister Jr. says the city has learned
something from both and will put that knowledge to use when it
moves forward with the new plan.
   ``We're not going to be reckless and support unproven
technology,'' he said.

   Stock prices slipped this morning in slow
trading, weakened by growing pressure for higher interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 7.29 points to
2,030.23 as of 11 a.m. EDT on Wall Street.
   Among broader market indicators, the New York Stock Exchange
composite index of all listed issues fell 0.53 to 148.00. On the
American Stock Exchange, the market value index dropped 0.50 to
295.98.
   Losing issues outnumbered gains by nearly 2-to-1 on the NYSE,
with 750 down, 401 up and 485 unchanged. Volume on the Big Board
totaled 58.53 million shares after the first 90 minutes of trading.
   Besides moves last week by the Federal Reserve and banks to
raise interest rates, Wall Street brokers said a number of
inflationary developments were pointing to still tighter credit
conditions worldwide and depressing stocks.
   Among them were a stronger-than expected-figure on U.S.
industrial production reported by the Commerce Department today.
The 0.8 percent July gain was double the June figure. In Britain,
meanwhile, stronger-than-expected retail sales contributed to a
selloff in the stock market there.
   ``The liquidation process is going on because of pressure on
short-term interest rates,'' said William King, head trader for

<HEAD>K mart's Profit Up 12 Percent in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TROY, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   K mart Corp. reported that its profit after
taxes rose 12 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier,
helped by modestly higher sales and an advertising campaign.
   The nation's second-largest retailer said Monday that its
second-quarter profit increased to $162.8 million, or 81 cents a
share, from $145.4 million, or 71 cents a share, in the
year-earlier quarter.
   Sales for the second quarter ended July 27 were up 6 percent, to
$6.68 billion from $6.30 billion a year earlier.
   ``While the sales increase in our K mart discount stores was
fairly modest, we are encouraged by the results from two of our
strategic programs,'' Chairman Joseph E. Antonini said.
   He said the company has been placing great emphasis on lowering
shelf prices.
   ``In addition, our once-a-week advertising program is gaining
momentum and giving new dimension to our various merchandising
programs,'' Antonini said.
   In the first six months of its fiscal year, K mart's profit rose
8.7 percent _ to $283.6 million, or $1.41 a share, from $260.9
million, or $1.28 a share.
   First-half sales increased 5.3 percent, to $12.53 billion from
$11.90 billion a year earlier.
   K mart is the second-largest U.S. retailer after Sears, Roebuck
and Co., with sales of $25.6 billion in 1987. As of July 27, 1988,
it operated 2,233 K mart discount stores, 1,163 Waldenbooks stores,
122 Builders Square home-improvement outlets and 257 Pay Less Drug
stores.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened sharply higher
today on the Chicago Board of Trade, but analysts said the market
remained shaky following Friday's volatile session.
   Soybeans for delivery in May opened up the 30-cents-a-bushel
daily limit, then retreated slightly.
   ``I wouldn't read anything into what's happened so far,'' Ted
Mao, a New York-based grain specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc., said shortly after the opening. ``The market really needs
some time to sort itself out.''
   Crop futures finished lower on Friday despite an overwhelmingly
bullish crop report from the Agriculture Department.
   Weather forecasts called for mostly hot and dry weather in the
Corn Belt this week, but Mao said traders also were looking for
evidence of new export business and further drought damage to the
crops before bidding prices up decisively.
   In early trading, wheat was 4 cents to 5 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.84{ a bushel; corn was 2}
cents to 6\ cents higher with September at $2.90 a bushel; oats
were 1{ cents to 3{ cents higher with September at $2.81{ a bushel;
soybeans were 4} cents to 26 cents higher with August at $8.68 a
bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange ahead of this afternoon's USDA monthly
7-state cattle-on-feed report.
   Live cattle were .12 cent lower to .30 cent higher with August
at 69.40 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .27 cent lower to .15
cent higher with August at 81.10 cents a pound; hogs were .32 cent
lower to .50 cent higher with August at 46.80 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .25 cent lower to .35 cent higher with August at
34.05 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mixed on Friday while pork futures
finished mostly lower.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Publishers To Pay Legal Expenses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INEZ, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The co-publishers of the Martin County Mercury
have been ordered to pay the court costs incurred by their rival
legal newspaper in a dispute over circulation.
   Attorneys John W. Kirk, of Lexington, and Leonard Stayton, of
Inez, have been ordered to pay legal expenses exceeding $11,000 for
Homer Marcum, publisher of the Martin Countian.
   Circuit Judge Nick Frazier of Paintsville also ruled that they
must pay Marcum's costs if they appeal the order.
   Frazier said they must pay the legal bills because they
continued to press the circulation case after it was settled in
March, 1987. Kirk and Stayton are the Mercury's co-publishers.
   ``The continued litigation as set forth can only lead this court
to believe that counsel for the Mercury caused the Martin Countian
to incur additional legal expenses for no valid reason other than
to harass the plaintiff,'' Frazier said Friday in his 39-page
decision. The decision was the result of a hearing held last
December.
   The case began in February, 1987, when Martin Fiscal Court voted
to designate the Mercury as the county's legal newspaper based on
figures presented by that newspaper. The move took the county's
legal business away from Marcum's feisty Martin Countian.
   Marcum called Kirk's circulation figures ``bogus'' and sued the
next day. In his ruling, Frazier said that the Mercury's press run
of 2,800 included hundreds of papers given away free in Kirk's law
offices in Prestonsburg and Hindman.
   The Martin Countian's circulation is about 4,350, Marcum said.
   On March 13, 1987, fiscal court voted 5-0 to reinstate the
Martin Countian as the legal newspaper.
   Frazier ruled that even though the circulation dispute was
settled when the magistrates reversed their decision, Kirk and
Stayton continued to press the case, forcing Marcum to incur
additional legal costs for depositions and responding to motions.
   Frazier invoked a civil judicial procedure rule requiring
attorneys who file so-called frivolous lawsuits or motions to pay
for defendants' legal expenses.

   The number of working domestic oil and gas rigs
fell by five this week to total 940, Baker Hughes Inc. reported
Monday.
   In last week's tally, the rig count jumped by 51 to total 945. A
year ago this week, the count was 998, the company said.
   Baker Hughes' rig count, the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity, reflects the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the number of working rigs since 1940.
   The rig count reached a peak of 4,500 active rigs in December
1981, which was the height of the oil boom. But oil prices plunged
to less than $10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 and the
rig count went with it, dropping to 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, Texas, Pennsylvania and Kansas
has the biggest gains with four each. Other states who saw an
increase include Ohio, three; and Michigan and North Dakota, two
each.
   New Mexico had the biggest decline with five; followed by
Colorado and Oklahoma, four each; and California and Louisiana, two
each.

<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. has agreed to sell to
Harris Corp. its $550 million-a-year Solid State division, which
makes chips for automotive, industrial and military markets, the
companies said Monday. The price was not disclosed.
   The Solid State division, which includes semiconductor
operations acquired in GE's purchase of RCA, employs about 10,000
people, GE said. It has headquarters in Somerville, N.J., and
plants in Findlay, Ohio; Mountaintop, Pa.; and Cupertino, Calif.
   Not included in the deal is GE's Microelectronics Center in
Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, which also makes chips for
military uses but only for use in GE's own products.
   GE, based in Fairfield, Conn., said the chip unit did not fit
with its strategy of focusing on businesses where it has global
leadership. Bruce Bunch, a GE spokesman, said the unit was
profitable but said he could not be more specific.
   Harris, which has headquarters in Melbourne, Fla., said the
purchase would ``complement and reinforce our own successful
semiconductor business.'' It said the deal unites two of the
industry's leading manufacturers of an advanced kind of chip known
as CMOS, for complementary metal-oxide semiconductor.
   Harris's own Semiconductor Sector employs about 4,000 people
worldwide and has annual sales of about $300 million.
   The deal is subject to the conclusion of a definitive agreement
and corporate and government reviews. It is expected to be
completed by the end of the year.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Washington-based investor group today launched
a tender offer for Interco Inc. even though the apparel and
furniture maker rejected the $2.69 billion bid a week ago.
   The group, which is led by the Rales brothers, is offering $70 a
share in cash, which values the company at $2.69 billion. Rales and
their associates, however, already own about 8.7 percent of
Interco's 38.4 million common shares outstanding.
   Last week Interco rejected the offer and took measures to
strengthen its defenses against unwanted suitors, including
amending the company's anti-takeover ``poison pill'' so that it
takes effect if a suitor acquires 15 percent or more of the
company's stock and makes a bid prohibitively expensive.
   In addition, Interco said it was continuing to persue a
restructuring plan that would include selling the company's
faltering apparel operations and paying shareholders a special
dividend.
   The Rales brothers, operating through Cardinal Acquisition Corp.
and City Capital Associates, said in a statement that Chase
Manhattan Bank has agreed to provide $500 million in financing.
Chase also said it is ``highly confident'' it will be able to raise
another $2.15 billion from a syndicate of other banks.
   The group headed by Steven Rales, 37, and his brother, Mitchell,
31, approached the Interco board with a $64-a-share takeover bid
last month. The group sweetened the offer to $70 a share but again
was rebuffed. Some analysts have estimated that Interco might be
worth as much as $78 a share.
   On Wall Street, Interco jumped $2.25 to $72.25 in active, early
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Based in St. Louis, Interco makes men's and women's apparel and
footwear as well as furniture and home furnishings. Some of its
brand names include London Fog clothing, Florsheim and Converse
shoes, and Broyhill and Ethan Allen furniture.
   In addition to its manufactufing operations, the company
operates 201 home improvement centers, general merchandise discount
stores, men's specialty apparel shops and specialty department
stores in 15 states.
   The company reported revenues of about $3.34 billion last year,
with the apparel group contributing about 24 percent.
   The tender offer expires at midnight EDT Sept. 12, unless
extended.

<HEAD>With BC-Britain-Unemployment</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Just a few months ago, Britain's economic
``disease'' of rampant inflation, sky-high interest rates and
persistent unemployment was pronounced cured y just about everyone
except the Conservative government's staunchest critics.
   Today, the economy is suffering something of a relapse,
exhibiting that old familiar symptom, higher inflation, and the
government admits it is troubling.
   In addition, a hike in interest rates and a sharp widening of
the trade deficit are worrying economists.
   Ironically, the symptoms' cause is the economy's vigorous
growth, which is stretching resources and driving up prices. Like
its trading ally, the United States, Britain faces the threat that
its economy could overheat into recession.
   The peak came in March when the Treasury's top official,
Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, announced the first
surplus budget in nearly 20 years and slashed the top income tax
rate to 40 percent from 60 percent.
   Since then, the attention has turned instead to Britain's annual
inflation rate, which, fed by strong consumer spending, has jumped
from 3.5 percent to 4.6 percent in June. In his budget speech,
Lawson had forecast an inflation rate of 4 percent by the end of
the year.
   To combat higher inflation _ Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
No. 1 economic priority _ the government has pushed interest rates
up more than 3 percentage points since early June.
   ``Whatever action is necessary to keep inflation under control,
this government will take,'' Lawson told members of Parliament in
late July, characterizing the pickup as ``modest but unacceptable.''
   Strength in the dollar gave the government room to raise
interest rates without pushing the British pound dangerously high.
But the pound, which has been trading at about 3.20 West German
marks, remains well above a rate of 3 marks which the government
long had protected.
   The pound broke through that ceiling in March, raising concerns
that Britain's export competitiveness might be hurt. Indeed, the
trade deficit is much worse than Lawson had forecast.
   For the first six months of 1988, Britain had a current account
deficit of 5.6 billion pounds ($9.6 billion), compared with a 1.6
billion pound ($2.6 billion) deficit in all of 1987. The current
account includes ``invisible'' trade such as services and overseas
investment earnings.
   In his budget speech, Lawson had forecast a trade deficit of 4
billion pounds ($7 billion) for all of 1988.
   ``Things have deteriorated,'' said Ian Harwood, an economist at
the London investment firm Warburg Securities. ``The major part of
the reason for the deterioration has been the way the economy has
been growing so much faster than expected.''
   David Owen, an economist with the London investment firm
Kleinwort Grieveson Ltd., said ``domestic demand is just growing
too quickly for its own good.''
   The latest survey conducted by the polling organization Market
and Opinion Research International, showed that in July, for the
first time since February 1987, more people thought the state of
the economy would get worse rather than better over the next year.
   Economists expect Britain's gross domestic product _ its total
output of goods and services _ to grow between 3.5 percent and 4
percent this year, faster than the 3 percent forecast by Lawson in
March, and following growth of 4.4 percent in 1987.
   On top of the troubling symptoms, there have been recurrent
reports of a rift between Mrs. Thatcher and Lawson over currency
exchange policy.
   These have been fueled by the pound's rise and the government's
negotiations with Mrs. Thatcher's former economic adviser, Sir Alan
Walters, for him to return to her Downing Street office next year.
   Mrs. Thatcher advocates free-market policies while Lawson favors
managing exchange rates through direct intervention in the markets
and the adjustment of interest rates.
   However, Lawson survived a Cabinet reshuffle by Mrs. Thatcher in
late July and now appears likely to remain until at least after
next spring's budget.
   But the economic outlook remains worrying, Harwood said.
   Inflation will peak at 6 percent early next year, interest rates
might move higher into the double digits, and the trade deficit
probably will balloon to 10 billion pounds ($17.2 billion) in 1988,
Harwood predicted.
   The government remains upbeat.
   ``The difficulties that beset us are difficulties we have
successfully dealt with in the past, and will do so again, without
drama, and without interrupting the steady progress we have already
achieved,'' Lawson said.

<HEAD>Rate Has Fallen For Two Years, But Critics Claim It Is Massaged</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thanks to a strong economy, Britain's persistently
high unemployment rate has fallen sharply, but critics claim the
government is massaging the figures to make them ook even better
than they are.
   Opponents of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government agree
that unemployment is down, but say exaggeration in the degree of
improvement is encouraging apathy toward the unemployed.
   The jobless rate has been falling for two years, reaching 8.4
percent in June, its lowest point in nearly seven years, the
Department of Employment says.
   Unemployment has fallen to 2.38 million people from a peak of
11.5 percent, or about 3.31 million in June 1986.
   The decline is the fastest among major Western industrialized
nations, the government says.
   But the Unemployment Unit, a private research and lobby
organization, says the rate would be 10.6 percent, representing
3.03 million people, if the calculation method were the same as
when the Conservatives first came into power in 1979.
   The British figures compare with a West German rate of 8.9
percent in June, which is unchanged from two years earlier, and a
French rate of 10.9 percent in May, which is up from 10.7 percent
two years before.
   An Employment Department spokesman, who requested anonymity,
said: ``We're still reasonably confident that it (ours) is an
accurate measure of unemployment.''
   Lawmaker Michael Meacher, the opposition Labor Party's spokesman
on unemployment, said: ``Unemployment has indeed been going down
over the last two years, but only about half as fast as the
government has been claiming.''
   Peter Kellner, a columnist for the Independent newspaper, wrote:
``If ... the calculations were done differently, it is doubtful
whether the government could claim, or would receive, anything like
the credit that the media and the public now bestow upon it.''
   Paul Convery, a director of the Unemployment Unit, said Britons
have become ``a little bit anesthetized,'' partly because they
generally are feeling better off economically, and partly because
the government has scored ``several sizable propaganda victories.''
   National unemployment registers have been the source for
unemployment statistics in all Common Market countries except
Spain, Portugal and Greece, the Unemployment Unit said.
   In 1982, Britain alone began basing its unemployment rate on the
number claiming unemployment benefits, rather than the number
registered as unemployed, it said.
   Since 1979, the government has made 22 changes in the way it
measures joblessness, all except one of which have reduced the
official unemployment rate, the Unemployment Unit said.
   The government denies that it has made that many changes or that
its alterations are designed to make the numbers look better.
   In a recent monthly unemployment report, the government said it
began counting as employed those people who are in government
training programs. That reduced the unemployment rate by 0.1
percent.
   The unit said the government has removed from the unemployment
benefit lists jobless men over age 60 who receive other kinds of
benefits.
   Part-time workers, whose numbers are increasing, have always
been counted as employed, and many jobless married women aren't
eligible for unemployment benefits, it said.
   Another way of measuring unemployment is to conduct surveys
which ask adults questions about their employment status. This
method is used monthly in the United States.
   In Britain, the government uses the method once a year, and
reveals the results a year later. By the survey method, Britain had
an unemployment rate of 10.7 percent in the spring of 1987. By the
government's regular method, the rate was 10.8 percent.
   ``They are so close that it shows that our own measure is
accurate,'' the department spokesman said.

   Stock prices dropped this morning in slow
trading, weakened by growing pressure for higher interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, still wobbly from a big
loss last week, fell 17.43 points to 2,020.09 as of noon EDT on
Wall Street.
   Among broader market indicators, the New York Stock Exchange
composite index of all listed issues fell 1.05 to 147.48. On the
American Stock Exchange, the market value index dropped 1.26 to
295.22.
   Losing NYSE issues outnumbered gains by nearly 3-to-1, with 919
down, 338 up and 496 unchanged. Volume on the Big Board totaled
56.3 million shares in the morning session, about half the 106.24
million traded Friday morning.
   Besides moves last week by the Federal Reserve and banks to
raise interest rates, Wall Street brokers said a number of
inflationary developments were pointing to still tighter credit
conditions worldwide and depressing stocks.
   Among them were a stronger-than expected-figure on U.S.
industrial production reported by the Commerce Department today.
The 0.8 percent July gain was double the June figure. In Britain,
meanwhile, stronger-than-expected retail sales contributed to a
selloff in the stock market there.
   ``The liquidation process is going on because of pressure on
short-term interest rates,'' said William King, head trader for
Nikko Securities Co. International in New York. ``You can't fight
that.''
   In addition, nervousness about the impact of the June trade
deficit figures to be released Tuesday played a role in the market
today, traders said. The consensus is for a shortfall little
changed from the $10.9 billion figure in May, but a
larger-than-expected number could provide a further excuse to sell.
   Newton D. Zinder, technical analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. said in a daily commentary that ``the market is clearly on the
defensive. A reflex rally could occur soon but a new sustainable
advance is still some time away.''
   Dividend-capture strategies dominated the NYSE's most-active

   Stock prices finished sharply lower Monday amid
growing fears that the British economy was overheating.
   The release of two British economic reports, which showed the
British economy growing at a greater-than-expected pace, caused
many investors to dump stock and flee to the sidelines.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed off
26.6 points, or 1.4 percent, at 1,816.8, slightly above its worst
level for the day of 1,816.6.
   Volume was a relatively light 346 million shares, compared with
Friday's 495 million shares.
   Also depressing British stock, dealers said, were sliding prices
on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average was off
around 19 points at the 2,019 level as London trading drew to a
close.
   The British government reported Monday that retail sales rose 2
percent in July and that industrial production fell 0.9 percent in
June.
   The figures sparked concern that a continuing boom in consumer
demand coupled with capacity constraints in industry could further
fuel inflationary pressures in the British economy, dealers said.
   That raised fears that British commercial banks' base lending
rate, which has been increased seven times, to 11 percent from 7.5
percent in early June, would be pushed up even higher.

<TEXT>
   A West German scandal involving
the use of illegal hormones to spur the growth of calves may spread
to the Netherlands and Italy, officials and news reports said
Monday.
   Discovery of the illegal hormone use has led to charges of an
international ``hormone mafia'' and the arrest of a major veal
producer in northwestern Germany.
   ``There is an illegal market for animal drugs that is causing
mischief both within the European Economic Community and outside of
it,'' said Klaus Matthiesen, agriculture minister for North
Rhine-Westphalia.
   The main substance at issue is testosterone, the male hormone
that is suspected of being a cancer-causing agent in large doses.
   Authorities last week arrested veal producer Felix Hying of
Borken in the northwestern part of the country after discovering
illegal hormone use. Hying was arrested on criminal charges of
violating the country's food and health laws that ban the use of
hormones. Prosecutors say Bernhard Wigger, another veal producer
from the same area, is suspected of using similar banned substances.
   Albert Rentmeister, a spokesman for the city of Borken, said
Wigger kept ``a thousand or more calves'' in the nearby Netherlands.
   Siegfried Martsch, a spokesman for the environmentalist Greens
party in the affected state of North Rhine-Westphalia, said:
``There is a possibility Wigger had business dealings with Italy.''
He did not reveal further details during a press conference in
Duesseldorf.
   The Hamburg-based Der Spiegel magazine and the Westdeutsche
Rundfunk radio station of Cologne said the hormones themselves came
from the Netherlands.
   Officials say they fear the scandal will grow.
   Matthiesen told reporters on Sunday he is convinced there is an
``international hormone mafia'' behind the illegal use.
   ``We have had many, many indications, not only in the last few
days but also for several months, that confirm this view,'' the
state minister said. ``There are ties going beyond national
boundaries.''
   West German offficials say it's the largest hormone scandal in
the country's nearly 40-year history.
   The issue is particularly sensitive for West Germans, who are
wary of food additives and similar substances.
   Health food firms also have been experiencing sharp growth in
recent years, while news accounts still chronicle the lingering
effects of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident on the nation's food
supply.
   Matthiesen on Friday ordered the confiscation of about 14,000
calves belonging to Wigger because of the suspected use of
testosterone.
   Testosterone is the principal male sex hormone, and it is
responsible for various male sex characteristics. Its use is banned
throughout the European Economic Community.
   Wigger says that needle marks found on a sampling of his calves
were only for routine immunizations.
   Also last week, in a separate action, North Rhine-Westphalia
officials accused calf breeder Hying of using testosterone on
thousands of his calves.
   Officials ordered the slaughter of 4,200 of Hying's calves that
tested postive for the hormone. More than 10,000 others were also
being tested. Hying remained in jail Monday afternoon pending
further investigation.
   Local prosecutor Klaus Deupmann told reporters Sunday that 500
of the calves remained unaccounted for after several days of
investigations.
   ``We can't exclude the possibility that these calves have
already been slaughtered, prepared and have reached the markets,''
Deupmann added.
   Both Wigger and Hying have their businesses in towns located
less than 10 kilometers (six miles) from the Dutch border.
   While experts say that testosterone is a suspected
cancer-causing agent, West German scientists say that quantities of
the substance found in the calves pose no danger to humans.

   Stock prices dropped today, weakened by growing
pressure for higher interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, still wobbly from a big
loss last week, fell 23.30 points to 2,014.22 as of 2 p.m. EDT on
Wall Street.
   Among broader market indicators, the New York Stock Exchange
composite index of all listed issues fell 1.38 to 147.15. On the
American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 1.98 to 294.50.
   Losing NYSE issues outnumbered gains by more than 3-to-1, with
1,105 down, 311 up and 474 unchanged. Volume on the Big Board
totaled 91.49 million shares with two hours of trading left.
   Besides moves last week by the Federal Reserve and banks to
raise interest rates, Wall Street brokers said a number of
inflationary developments were pointing to still tighter credit
conditions worldwide and depressing stocks.
   Among them were a stronger-than expected-figure on U.S.
industrial production reported by the Commerce Department today.
The 0.8 percent July gain was double the June figure. In Britain,
meanwhile, stronger-than-expected retail sales contributed to a
selloff in the stock market there.
   ``The liquidation process is going on because of pressure on
short-term interest rates,'' said William King, head trader for
Nikko Securities Co. International in New York. ``You can't fight
that.''
   In addition, nervousness about the impact of the June trade
deficit figures to be released Tuesday played a role in the market
today, traders said. The consensus is for a shortfall little
changed from the $10.9 billion figure in May, but a
larger-than-expected number could provide a further excuse to sell.
   Newton D. Zinder, technical analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. said in a daily commentary that ``the market is clearly on the
defensive. A reflex rally could occur soon but a new sustainable
advance is still some time away.''
   Dividend-capture strategies dominated the NYSE's most-active
list and inflated the actual volume of business. GTE fell \ to 40{,
with more than 7.7 million shares traded.
   Among actively traded blue chip stocks, IBM fell 2 to 116, Union

<HEAD>CIA Report Says Inflation Up Last Spring in US, Industrial
Countries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inflation, as measured by consumer prices,
rose last spring in the United States and its main trading
partners, according to a Central Intelligence Agency report made
available Monday.
   The CIA's Directorate of Intelligence found that while U.S.
inflation fell from 3.7 percent in 1987 to an annualized rate of
3.4 percent in the first quarter, it rose in the March-June period
to 4.8 percent.
   Canada's inflation rate fell from a 4.4 percent rate last year
to 3.2 percent in the first quarter, but also picked up in the
second quarter, to 5 percent, the report said.
   Britain had a 4.1 percent inflation rate in 1987. The level
dropped to 2.4 percent in the first quarter and rose to 6.1 percent
in the second quarter, the report said.
   Among other major industrialized nations tracked in the CIA
report, Japan's first-quarter inflation rate fell by 2.1 percent
from a 0.1 percent rate in 1987 but rose to 2.8 percent in the
second quarter.
   West Germany's 1987 inflation of 0.3 percent doubled to 0.6
percent in the first quarter and rose to 1.9 percent in the spring.
   The rise was less marked in France and Italy, countries more
usually inclined to inflation. The French rate of 2.8 percent in
the second quarter of 1988 was an increase over the winter rate of
2.3 percent, but still below the 3.3 percent of 1987.
   In Italy, the rate was 4.6 percent in 1987, after falling
steadily since the 14.9 percent level of 1983. It was down to 3.1
percent in the first quarter of this year but then rose again to
4.5 percent in the second three months.
   The CIA's twice-monthly ``Economic and Energy Indicators'' for
July 29 did not provide figures for smaller countries.
   The International Monetary Fund, which does, says inflation on
the consumer level among 21 industrial countries rose to an
annualized rate of 3 percent in May from 2.9 percent of 1987.
   The IMF said the average inflation level for 116 other
countries, mostly in the Third World, was 39.8 percent in 1987. It
increased to a rate of 55.7 percent in January, however few figures
for later months were available.
   Financial authorities have been especially worried about Brazil,
with the biggest economy in Latin America and the biggest debt in
the Third World. The IMF reported Brazilian inflation at more than
229 percent last year and rising at an annual rate of just under
500 percent in April.
   Argentina's rate was 131 percent in 1987, having risen steadily
throughout the year, according to the IMF. It has been reported
rising since, but the fund had no 1988 figures for Argentina in its
statistics for August.
   South Korea, on the other hand, has been keeping its rate below
3 percent in recent years, although it reached that level in 1987
and reported an annual rate of 7.4 percent this June, the IMF said.
   Bolivia, where the inflation rate hit a high of 11,750 percent
in 1985, was down to 15 percent last year and has been reporting
between 8 percent and 9 percent in 1988, the IMF said.
   The current inflation front-runner among the IMF's members is
Nicaragua, with an annual rate of more than 3,766 percent in June.

<HEAD>Random House To Buy Crown Publishing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Random House Inc. said Monday it has signed a
contract to acquire Crown Publishing Group, a book marketer and
publisher whose best-selling authors include Judith Krantz, Jean
Auel and Dominick Dunne. The purchase price was not disclosed.
   Crown's biggest business is Publishers Central Bureau, a major
mail-order distributor of books and audio and visual materials; its
second biggest is Outlet Book Co., a leading marketer of
promotional, remaindered and bargain books.
   Random House, which is owned by the Newhouse family's Advance
Publications, said the acquisition would open ``new opportunities
in the mail order and promotional book fields.''
   Nat Wartels, who co-founded Crown with Bob Simon in 1933, will
remain as chairman of Crown. Simon died in 1966. Alan Mirken will
remain as president of Crown while becoming vice chairman of Random
House.
   Wartels, who is 86, said in a news release: ``We thought long
and hard about selling Crown. But when the time came three weeks
ago, we spoke only to Random House.''
   He said he was impressed by the amount of support and
independence Random House has given to such previous acquisitions
as Alfred A. Knopf, Pantheon, Times Books, Villard, Ballantine and
Fawcett.
   Mirken said ``it was a very harmonious negotiation'' that was
done over three weeks without investment bankers.
   Judith Krantz's new novel, ``Till We Meet Again,'' will be No. 3
on the New York Times best-seller list Sunday, four weeks before
official publication, the news release said. Dominick Dunne's
``People Like Us'' has been on the Times best-seller list 14 weeks.
Jean Auel wrote ``Clan of the Cave Bear'' and ``The Mammoth
Hunters.''
   The sale is expected to be completed by Sept. 30.

   Fear of rising interest rates bedeviled the
stock market again today and depressed the Dow Jones industrial
average to the lowest closing level in nearly three months.
   Trading was extremely light, which brokers called a reflection
of slack summer business, the extrordinarily hot weather and
skepticism about the market's prospects in the aftermath of the
sharp losses last week.
   ``The sellers are just getting plain tired. They're just getting
worn out,'' said Robert O'Toole, manager of over-the-counter
trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York. ``There's no
bids.''
   Stronger-than-expected industrial production figures released by
the Commerce Department set the mood for the market's weakness by
raising anxiety that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates
further to slow economic growth.
   Last week the Fed's hike in the discount rate from 6 percent to
6.5 percent rattled the stock and bond markets and contributed to a
81.61-point weekly drop in the Dow average, the biggest weekly
decline since early spring.

<TEXT>
   OPEC General Secretary Subroto said
Monday the Persian Gulf cease-fire should lower OPEC production by
around 1 million barrels a day, enabling the organization to solve
its overproduction problem without drastic output cuts.
   Oil traders reacted skeptically to the statement and oil prices
were little changed. The September contract for West Texas
Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, rose 9 cents
to $15.61 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Subroto, who is touring Latin American oil producers, said he
will go to Iran and Iraq following the scheduled Aug. 20 cease-fire
to try to convince the former enemies to accept equal production
quotas as they end their eight-year war.
   He said said the organization could opt for a new lower
benchmark price ``of, say, $17'' in its November regular meeting as
an alternative to cutting production.
   He added that the organization's price committee would meet
sometime after the last week in August but before the Nov. 21 OPEC
ministerial conference.
   ``The outcome of the cease-fire is anyone's guess, but my
opinion is that (Iran and Iraq) will be rational and what they will
rationally want is higher prices to build their economies,''
Subroto told a press conference.
   ``By bringing Iraq's production to equal that of Iran, this will
reduce OPEC production without reducing the temporary quota of
anyone (else). ... With that policy, we will be able to strengthen
prices without a lower production level,'' he said.
   ``I will try my best to convince Iran to accept parity,'' said
Subroto, who is the Indonesian oil minister. Iran's quota is
2,369,000 barrels per day.
   He said a parity agreement would ``at least'' reduce Iraq's
production by 600,000 to 700,000 barrels per day, while an end to
oil loans to Iraq by its allies Saudi Arabia and Kuwait could
result in a total cutback of 1 million barrels.
   He said he would visit both nations in the last week of August
and would report the results of his talks to the OPEC price
committee, which would then meet prior to the organization's
November regular conference.
   He said OPEC might decide in November for ``a higher production
level but at a lower price of, say, $17'' per barrel.
   ``What strategy we take depends on the (regular) conference,''
he said. OPEC's current target price is $18 per barrel, although
actual market prices are $14 to $15 a barrel.

<HEAD>Drexel Employees Owned Stake in Boesky Arbitrage Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of 27 employees of Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc., including top dealmaker Michael Milken, owned a stake
in the arbitrage firm of Ivan F. Boesky beginning in 1984,
according to a published report Monday.
   The previously unknown financial tie raises questions of
potential conflicts of interest for Milken and Drexel, according to
lawyers and Wall Street executives interviewed by the Wall Street
Journal.
   From 1984 to 1986, when the Drexel employee group held a stake
in Boesky's operation, Boesky was Wall Street's most powerful
takeover speculator and traded in many stocks about which Drexel
had valuable inside information.
   A spokesman for Drexel said the Drexel employees were only
passive investors with no role in the operations Boesky's firm.
   The Journal said the tie was revealed in public documents filed
in Washington, D.C., and California; private offering documents;
and people familiar with the relationship.
   Boesky was sentenced to three years in prison last December on a
criminal charge stemming from the government's investigation into
wrongdoing on Wall Street. He previously agreed to pay a $100
million penalty to settle a civil complaint of insider trading and
was banished from the securities business.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission approved civil charges of
securities-law violations against Drexel, Milken and three other
Drexel employees, but so far the charges have not been filed.
   The charges are based largely on allegations of illegal dealings
between Boesky and Drexel, the Journal said, citing people familiar
with the investigation.
   The Journal said people close to Drexel say the Drexel
employees, through a general partnership known as Camro Associates,
invested $1 million in the Boesky firm, Seemala Corp., in 1984, and
received $3 million for their stake in 1986.
   Camro was made up largely of employees of Drexel's junk bond
operations in Beverly Hills, Calif., the Journal said.
   A Drexel spokesman, Steven Anreder, told the Journal, ``The
investment was made over four years ago with the full knowledge and
consent of'' Drexel. ``It was fully disclosed and the amount
involved was only 1 percent of the equity (of Seemala) based on
book value.''
   Anreder described the investment as ``strictly passive,''
meaning the Drexel investors were not involved in the business of
Seemala. He said Monday that Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson,
a law firm working for Seemala, proposed the investment for tax
reasons.
   Leon Silverman, a lawyer for Boesky, declined comment Monday.
   After the Drexel employee group sold its stake in Boesky's
arbitrage firm in 1986, Drexel took its own stake in Boesky's
successor firm. Drexel sold $660 million in notes as part of
Boesky's effort to raise $1 billion in debt and equity for his new
firm, received $24 million in investment banking fees, and invested
$5 million in the new firm.

   Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch household products
group, said Monday its second-quarter net profit jumped 12 percent,
with most lines of business contributing to the improvement.
   Unilever, whose brands include Lever, Lipton, and
Chesebrough-Pond's, said net profit in the three months ended June
30 rose to $410 million from $367 million in the same period a year
earlier.
   Sales gained 5 percent to $8.25 billion from $7.84 billion in
the year-earlier period.
   Those results are based on translating results into dollars for
both periods at the rates of exchange that applied at the end of
1987: one British pound equal to 3.33 Dutch guilders equal to $1.87.
   ``The second quarter showed a stronger improvement over 1987
than that achieved in the first quarter,'' said Michael Angus,
chairman of the company's British arm, Unilever PLC. ``Most parts
of the business contributed to this result.''
   ``The outlook for the year as a whole is encouraging,'' the
chairman added.
   For the first six months of the year, net profit rose 9 percent
to $760 million from $696 million in the first half of last year.
   Sales increased 4 percent to $15.9 billion from $15.4 billion a
year earlier.

   Fear of rising interest rates bedeviled the
stock market Monday and depressed the Dow Jones industrial average
to its lowest closing level in nearly three months.
   The barometer of 30 blue-chip stocks, still wobbly from its
81.61-point decline last week, dropped 33.25 to close at 2,004.27.
The last time the Dow average closed lower was May 27, when it
finished at 1,956.44.
   Broader market indicators also finished sharply lower.
   ``You still have this global interest rate pressure,'' said
William King, head trader at Nikko Securities Co. International in
New York. ``That's why the market got whacked.''
   The mood was set for the decline by a government report that
July industrial production rose 0.8 percent, double the June figure
and much higher than market expectations.
   The report raised fear that the Federal Reserve's
credit-tightening last week, which jacked up interest rates to the
highest level of the year, wasn't sufficient to quell inflation
pressures in the economy.
   Brokers said trading remained extremely sluggish, reflecting a
broad lack of interest in stocks by institutional investors that
are the biggest influences in the market.
   ``There are real heavy cash positions out there,'' said Thomas
Ianiro, a partner on the trading desk at William Blair & Co. in
Chicago. ``People are just waiting for all these news events.''
   A key event anticipated by many market participants was the June
merchandise trade deficit figure, scheduled for release by the
Commerce Department before the market opened Tuesday. But there was
a widespread view that whatever the deficit, it was more likely to
hurt stocks than help them.
   A number vastly higher than the $10.9 billion shortfall in May
could weaken the dollar and encourage a selloff in stocks, some
brokers argued. Conversely, a sharply lower figure could also hurt
stocks by reinforcing fears that the domestic economy is growing
too fast.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by nearly 4-to-1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,194 down, 345 up and 432 unchanged.
   Volume on the NYSE floor totaled 128.56 million shares, down
from 176.96 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at
regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled
150.33 million shares.
   Technology and computer stocks were among the biggest losers,
led by Digital, which dropped 3 to 97, its lowest point in nearly
two years. Elsewhere, IBM dropped 2~ to 115[, Compaq dropped 1~ to

<HEAD>Crop Futures Soar On Hot, Dry Weather Outlook</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures posted their strongest gains in a week
Monday in response to predictions that crops in the drought-weary
Corn Belt would bake in triple-digit heat for most of this week.
   On other markets, most livestock and meat futures rose; precious
metals advanced; energy futures were higher; and stock-index
futures retreated.
   Monday's midday weather forecasts, coming on the heels of a hot,
mostly dry weekend in the Midwest, stoked fears of further damage
to the crops and helped push most corn, oat and soybean contracts
up their permitted daily limits on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Meteorologists said the same weather pattern that had made the
spring and early summer unseasonally warm and dry was
reestablishing itself and intensifying, promising at least several
more days of searing heat in the Midwest.
   ``We're going to have extreme heat right into Thursday, 100 to
110 degrees in the Corn Belt,'' said Charles Notis, a private
forecaster based in Des Moines, Iowa.
   After the close, the National Weather Service issued a
six-to-10-day outlook predicting above-normal temperatures but
normal to above-normal rainfall for the Farm Belt during the first
five days of next week.
   Analysts said the soybean crop was nearing the end of its
vulnerable flowering and pod-setting stage, a four-to-six-week
period during which weather plays a crucial role in determining
yields.
   The hot weekend weather probably caused some deterioration of
the soybean crop, analysts said. And the forecasts for similar
weather this week likely means yields will fall further, making
contracts for future deliveries of soybeans more precious, Karlin
said.
   Corn and oat futures soared their 10-cents-a-bushel daily limit.
Soybeans were limited to moves of 30 cents a bushel, expect for the
limitless August contract, which finished with a gain of more than
38 cents.
   Wheat settled 9 cents to 14{ cents higher with the contract for
delivery in September at $3.92 a bushel; corn was 7} cents to 10
cents higher with September at $2.97\ a bushel; oats were 7{ cents
to 10 cents higher with September at $2.87{ a bushel; soybeans were
27{ cents to 38{ cents higher with August at $8.87 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures finished mostly higher on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange ahead of the Agriculture Department's monthly
seven-state cattle-on-feed report.
   The government reported cattle marketings during July were 4
percent higher than the same month a year ago, which surprised most
analysts and prompted predictions of a sharply higher opening
Tuesday.
   The number of cattle on feed Aug. 1 in the seven largest
cattle-producing states was 2 percent larger than a year ago, while
2 percent fewer cattle were placed on feedlots in those states
during July.
   The high marketing number startled analysts, most of whom had
expected a decline. The number meant there had been fewer
drought-related sales of cattle to packing houses than analysts had
believed, said Chuck Levitt, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. in Chicago.
   Live cattle closed .07 cent to .45 cent higher with August at
69.60 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to 1.15 cents
higher with August at 81.75 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent to
.57 cent higher with August at 47.37 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .52 cent lower to .70 cent higher with August at 33.65
cents a pound.
   Precious metals futures posted modest gains on the Commodity
Exchange in New York in response to the inflationary implications
of higher prices for most other commodities, said Bernard Savaiko,
an analyst in New York with PaineWebber Inc.
   Gold settled $1.70 to $2 higher with August at $433 a troy
ounce; silver was 4.5 cents to 4.6 cents higher with September at
$6.785 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures prices rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange
in thin dealings in the absence of major fresh news to drive the
market.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 4 cents to 14 cents
higher with September at $15.61 a barrel; heating oil was .23 cent
to .41 cent higher with September at 44.27 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .39 cent to .75 cent higher with September at 46.37
cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures slumped on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
amid fears of rising interest rates, analysts said.
   The contract for September delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500
index settled 3.45 points lower at 259.10.

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed Ahead of Trade Figures; Gold Rises</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished mixed Monday in mostly light
trading, as some dealers sold the currency in anticipation of
Tuesday's report on the U.S. trade deficit for June.
   Gold prices rose. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
bid price for gold of $432.35 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up
from $431 late Friday.
   The dollar started the trading day by falling in the Far East,
then recovering from its early lows to finish little changed in
Europe. The dollar retreated anew against several key currencies in
later New York trading.
   Analysts attributed that decline mainly to dollar sales by
traders balancing their dollar-heavy positions ahead of the latest
of the monthly trade reports, which tend to strongly influence the
U.S. currency's movements. A negative trade performance usually
sends the dollar lower, and vice versa.
   ``We had some slight lightening of long dollar positions,'' said
Robert Hatcher, a vice president of corporate trading at the New
York office of Barclays Bank PLC of Britain.
   Traders are reluctant to hold big dollar positions because of
the possibility of a surprise in the June figures. Many traders and
economists are expecting a shortfall of between $10 billion and $12
billion. The trade deficit was $10.9 billion in May.
   Dealers said the dollar was supported, on the other hand, by the
continuing impact of last week's unexpected hike to 6.5 percent in
the Federal Reserve's discount rate, the interest it charges on
loans to member U.S. financial institutions. Rising U.S. interest
rates make dollars more valuable.
   The dollar was scarcely affected by the news Monday that U.S.
industrial production shot up 0.8 percent in July, the biggest
increase in nine months, market watchers said.
   ``All the traders are waiting for the next direction in the
dollar'' from the trade figures, said David Godwin, a dealer for
Union Bank of Switzerland.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar traded at 132.95 Japanese yen, down 0.10 yen from
Friday's close. Later, in London, it was quoted at 133.15 yen. By
the end of New York trading, the dollar was at 133.32 yen, up
slightly from 133.28 yen late Friday.
   In London, it cost $1.7145 to buy one British pound, cheaper
than $1.7155 late Friday. Later, in New York, the pound remained
steady at $1.7145, more expensive than $1.7130 late Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.8805 West German marks, down from 1.8833; 1.5790
Swiss francs, up from 1.5777; 6.3760 French francs, down from
6.3965; 1,394.75 Italian lire, down from 1,397.50; and 1.2270
Canadian dollars, up from 1.2111.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday: 1.8810
West German marks, up from 1.8805; 1.5780 Swiss francs, up from
1.5750; 6.3780 French francs, down from 6.3810; 2.1257 Dutch
guilders, up from 2.1146; 1,398.00 Italian lire, up from 1,395.50;
and 1.2196 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2195.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $430.40 a troy ounce,
compared with late Friday's bid of $431.50. In Zurich, Switzerland,
gold fell to a bid $431.00 an ounce, compared with Friday's $432.50.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $433.80 an ounce, up from
Saturday's finish of $430.68.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery
rose to $433 a troy ounce from $431.30 late Friday.
   Silver bullion prices dipped in London to a late bid price of
$6.72 a troy ounce from $6.73 late Friday.
   On New York's Comex, silver for current delivery rose to $6.757
a troy ounce from $6.712 late Friday.

   Eastern Airlines announced Monday that it was
slashing fares between Florida and 16 Northeastern cities to $69
for the post-Labor Day season.
   Houston-based Continental Airlines, Eastern's sister company
under the Texas Air Corp. umbrella, also has announced a special
$69 one-way fare between Florida and 10 cities in the Northeast.
   The Eastern tickets, which carry a number of restrictions, went
on sale Monday and will be sold through Aug. 26. The tickets apply
to travel beginning Sept. 11 through Dec. 15 at savings of as much
as 40 percent.
   Louis Markesano, an airline analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott
Inc., called the move a typical seasonal promotion. ``Other
airlines will have some kind of matching with similar
restrictions,'' he said.
   Paula Musto, a spokeswoman for Eastern, said she did not expect
the special fare to touch off a pricing war.
   ``That's not our intention,'' Musto said. ``We just want to put
a good fall promotion out there.''
   Eastern suffered a drop in passengers during its
highly-publicized inspection by the Federal Aviation
Administration, which found no important safety violations.
   The $69 fare is based on round-trip travel and applies Tuesdays
through Fridays on northbound flights and Sundays through
Wednesdays on southbound flights.
   The fare applies to travel to and from Florida cities such as
Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Orlando and Tampa as well as Baltimore,
Boston, Buffalo, Cleveland, Hartford, Newark, New York,
Philadelphia, Providence and Washington, among others.

<HEAD>Farm Credit System Reports Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Farm Credit System on Monday reported a
profit for the second quarter, continuing an improvement trend
based on a reduction in its provision for loan losses.
   The system said it had combined net income of $170 million for
the quarter, compared with a net loss of $46 million a year ago.
Also contributing to the positive results were increased net
interest income and a gain on the sales of certain properties.
   The system's net interest income totaled $214 million, compared
with $110 million in the year-ago period.
   Alan Fass, president and chief executive officer of the Federal
Farm Credit Banks Funding Corp., the financing arm of the farm
credit system, said improvements in net interest income resulted
from increased reinstatements of nonaccrual loans to accrual status
and from a modest decrease in the system's overall cost of debt.
   When loans are placed on nonaccrual status they are accounted
for only as they come in rather than when they are due.
   During the second quarter, the system reported negative
provisions for loan losses of $181 million, compared with a
negative provision of $10 million a year earlier.
   ``In spite of the current drought, the recent improvements in
the agricultural economy continued throughout the second quarter,
resulting in stabilized loan collateral values and other
improvements in the overall credit quality of the system's loan
portfolio,'' Fass said.
   He noted that while it is too early to assess the impact of the
current drought on system institutions, the system ``has been
monitoring the drought very closely because of its potential impact
on borrowers in certain parts of the country.''
   For the first six months, the system reported net income of $336
million compared with a loss of $201 million a year ago. Net
interest income during the period totaled $360 million, up from
$258 million a year ago.
   During the second half, the system reported negative provisions
for loan losses of $341 million, compared with a provision of $105
million a year earlier.
   The Farm Credit System consists of 37 borrower-owned banks and
associations serving the rural economy. Congress put it on a more
secure footing last year by authorizing the issuance of up to $4
billion in government-backed, low-interest loans. The 1987
legislation, by increasing confidence in the Farm Credit System,
made it possible to narrow the interest-rate spreads on Farm Credit
debt obligations over U.S. Treasury securities.

<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community has
established formal diplomatic relations with some member nations of
its Soviet bloc counterpart, COMECON, a West German official said
Monday.
   The official, who asked not to be identified, said at least four
of the COMECON countries _ the Soviet Union, East Germany,
Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria _ had established formal ties with the
EEC and that announcements on others were expected.
   The other COMECON members are Hungary, Poland, Romania, Albania,
Mongolia, Cuba and Vietnam.
   East Germany's state-run ADN news agency quoted the country's
foreign ministry spokesman, Wolfgang Meyer, as saying the move
contributes to the creation of a ``common European house.''
   Soviet bloc officials have used that phrase in recent weeks in
calling for closer unity between Eastern and Western Europe.
   Two months ago COMECON, which stands for the Council for Mutual
Economic Assistance, and the EEC paved the way for establishing
formal ties by signing documents of mutual recognition.
   Talks between COMECON and the EEC on establishing official links
began in September 1986.

<HEAD>Judge Throws Out Some Allegations in Suits Against Media General</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Monday dismissed lawsuit
allegations that top Media General Corp. officials had an
obligation to consider an unsolicited merger offer from investor
Burt Sugarman.
   But U.S. District Judge Richard L. Williams refused to throw out
suit allegations that Media General made misleading statements in a
recent proxy fight and that its board of directors may have acted
improperly in creating a two-tiered stock structure that makes
takeovers impossible without the consent of top management.
   The allegations were contained in two lawsuits filed by
stockholders against the Richmond-based media company after
Sugarman made a $1.8 billion buyout offer for the company's Class A
stock in late February.
   Media General repeatedly rebuffed the overtures by Sugarman, who
staged an unsuccessful proxy fight for three seats on the board of
directors in May.
   Media General Chairman D. Tennant Bryan and his family own 71
percent of the company's Class B shares, which control the election
of the other six board members. Bryan has said the family's
interest is not for sale.
   Sugarman failed in a lawsuit to get a ruling allowing a combined
Class A and B shareholders' majority vote on the takeover offer,
and was critical of the company's two-tier stock structure.
   On Monday, Williams told the plaintiffs in the shareholder suits
that they should be prepared to show him at a Sept. 8 pre-trial
meeting that their cases should go to a jury.
   ``For some time now the court has suspected that both were filed
with the thought in mind that if Sugarman was successful on his
claims, the other shareholders might reap a corresponding
windfall,'' the judge said.
   Stockholders Harry M. Jasper of New York and Sarah Shields of
Florida filed one of the suits, contending they paid too much for
their Media General stock because the price was inflated by
incomplete or misleading statements by some of the company's top
officers.
   Ms. Shields and Jasper also claimed the Bryans had a fiduciary
duty to investigate and consider Sugarman's merger plan and a later
restructuring proposal.
   But Williams noted the Bryans also are the principal
stockholders, in addition to being directors.
   ``Once the Bryans as controlling shareholders had firmly
rejected Sugarman's offer, the board of directors had practically
no role to play with respect'' to the Sugarman offer, the judge
said.
   The Bryans' duty as directors ``does not obliterate their right,
as shareholders, to sell or not to sell their stock as they
choose,'' said Williams.
   The second suit was filed by Kenneth Rosenthal, who said the
Bryans, as principal shareholders, had a duty to other
shareholders. Williams dimissed that part of Rosenthal's suit,
saying Virginia law made no such requirement.

   Harold W. Schaefer, an inventor and
former president of Eureka Co., the vacuum cleaner manufacturer,
died Monday at age 79, company spokesmen said.
   An electrical engineer and the holder of more than 100 patents,
Schaefer joined Eureka in 1962 and served as president and director
until his retirement in 1980.
   The Chicago native, born Feb. 16, 1909, worked as a young man
for Chicago-based Majestic Radio, where he invented a power supply
system considered an important component in the development of the
radio industry.
   From 1941 to 1943, he served as director of engineering and
manufacturing for the applied physics laboratory at Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore, where he worked on projects for the U.S.
Office of Scientific Research and Development.
   In 1943, Schaefer became manager of facilities planning and
radio and television product development for RCA Corp., but he left
the following year to become division manager in charge of
engineering, manufacturing and product development for the
Westinghouse Electric Corp.
   Schaefer joined Philco in 1950 as vice president and director of
engineering of consumer and commercial products and later became
general manager of the appliance division.
   Schaefer is survived by his wife Mary and a son, Harold.

<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Troubled Beverly Enterprises, the
nation's biggest nursing-home company, announced Monday it had
arranged real estate transactions to raise $155 million to cover an
anticipated debt.
   The company said it would mortgage 75 nursing homes to raise
$120 million in cash and raise an additional $35 million by selling
and then leasing back 27 additional facilities.
   Neither transaction will affect patients or staff at any of the
nursing homes or congregate living centers involved, the company
said.
   Beverly Enterprises, suffering under heavy debt and slow
reimbursements, said it would use the cash to repay $148 million
worth of liquid yield option notes due Sept. 30. The notes, similar
to zero-coupon bonds, are publicly traded.
   The company has arranged with a lender to take out mortgages on
75 nursing homes in 17 states that either are owned outright or
carry small mortgages, said Beverly Enterprises spokesman William
Wright. He refused to reveal the identity of the lender for the
pool of mortgages.
   The sale-leaseback deal calls for purchase of 26 nursing homes
and one congregate living center in seven states to Health Care
Property Investors Inc., a Los Angeles real estate investment trust.
   Health Care Property announced it had agreed to pay $62 million
for the facilities. The transaction includes assumption of $10
million in mortgages by Health Care Property and for Beverly
Enterprises to temporarily finance $10 million of the price.
   Beverly Enterprises, which said it expects to get approximately
$35 million cash out of the deal, immediately will sign long-term
leases on the facilities and continue operating them without
interruption, Wright said.

<HEAD>Striking Nurses Bargaining Again, Service Workers Accept Accord</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs grafs 6-7 bgng `On wages' with two grafs to CORRECT that
only one tier of workers gets 3 percent each of two years of
contract and that bonuses are `up to' $300</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some 1,700 hospital service workers at
seven hospitals overwhelmingly approved a two-year contract Monday
while more than 2,000 striking nurses from six of the same
hospitals returned to the bargaining table.
   Despite ratification, the agreement calls for members of Local
250 of the Hospital and Health Care Workers Union to remain off the
job until the California Nurses Association ratifies an accord.
   But union leaders this weekend indicated it was not certain they
would enforce that provision if the nurses' dispute continues for
more than a few days.
   The service workers' union reported 92 percent of its members
voted for ratification of a contract, which was reached in a
60-hour negotiating session under the auspices of Mayor Art Agnos
and a federal mediator.
   The union said it struck a compromise over sick time and
vacation days, and eliminated plans by the hospitals to require
workers to pay a share of the basic health insurance plan. It also
said the two-year agreement restored fringe benefits for both
full-time and part-time workers.
   On wages, the licensed vocational nurses will get a 3 percent
increase over two years, going from $12.05 an hour to $12.40 an
hour. The technical classes will get $12.25 by the end of the
contract. Employees at the lower end of a two-tier wage system will
get 3 percent increases in each of the two years.
   Service and maintenance workers, who account for 45 percent of
union membership, will get no raise, but lump-sum bonuses of up to
$300 by the end of the pact.
   It was the first strike for Local 250 in 50 years.
   Talks between the Affiliated Hospitals management group and the
California Nurses Association were renewed Sunday, also assisted by
Agnos and the mediator.
   The service workers accord raised hopes for a quick end to the
labor problems that have hobbled eight hospitals for nearly a month.
   The major issues in the nurses strike, which started Aug. 2,
include demands for big salary increases, overtime pay for weekend
work and staffing improvements. The nurses object to a management
demand for the right to impose 12-hour workdays.
   Local 250's members include vocational nurses, surgical and
psychiatric technicians, dietary workers, janitors and housekeeping
employees. Pay currently ranges from $7.90 an hour for lower-tier
housekeeping, laundry and and food service workers and hospital
aides to $11.90 hourly for technicians and licensed vocational
nurses.
   Within a day of the tentative agreement, talks with the
registered nurses began, but Eileen Maloney, a spokesman for Agnos,
cautioned against hopes for an immediate settlement.
   The average salary for a nurse working for one of the Affiliated
Hospitals ranges between $30,072 and $37,692 for day shifts, and
$34,583 to $43,346 for night shift nurses.
   Hospitals hit by the strike have employed nurses from around the
country as replacements. The replacements are being recruited with
promises of hourly wages ranging between $20 and $25 an hour, plus
free air fare and accommodations while in San Francisco.
   The CNA said the high cost of hiring replacements was applying
great pressure on the hospitals to settle quickly.
   The Affiliated Hospitals group represents Children's, Marshal
Hale, Mount Zion, St. Francis and St. Mary's in San Francisco, and
Seton Medical Center in Daly City. Nurses also are on strike at
French Hospital, where talks are being held separately.
   The service workers union are on strike at the same hospitals,
plus Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center, where the registered
nurses are not unionized.

   In a unique move aimed at fending off a

charges of stock manipulation, Cabot Corp. has adopted a defense

   Wayne-based GAF asked the Federal Trade Commission on Aug. 1 for

Waltham, Mass.-based energy and chemicals company, to as much as 25
percent.
   Cabot responded by amending its anti-takeover defense so it
would be triggered if at least 15 percent of a company's common
stock was held by a person targeted for government investigation or
action.
   Once the ``poison pill'' was triggered, Cabot stockholders could
buy more shares at half the market price, making a hostile takeover
prohibitively expensive.
   A federal grand jury in Manhattan indicted GAF and its
vice-chairman James T. Sherwin in July on charges they manipulated
the price of Union Carbide common stock after an unsuccessful
attempt to take over the larger company in 1986.
   GAF and Sherwin both pleaded innocent to the charges in the
indictment, which marked the first criminal charges against a U.S.
industrial enterprise stemming indirectly from revelations of Ivan
Boesky, the Wall Street felon at the center of the widespread
insider trading scandal.
   The indictment charged that GAF and Sherwin attempted to create
an artificial demand for Carbide stock after GAF's takeover attempt
failed, allegedly to allow GAF to sell its 10 percent stake at a
better profit or a minimal loss.
   Cabot's takeover defense, which was designed by the New York law
firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, is considered possibly
the first attempt to capitalize on Wall Street's insider trading
scandal.
   The idea could signal a trend, as several other major takeover
players are under investigation in the scandal.
   It was not clear whether GAF actually intended to mount a
takeover bid for Cabot, however. Telephone calls to the company
seeking comment on Monday night were not answered.
   Cabot has been considered by some analysts as a candidate for
takeover or restructuring aimed at boosting its stock price. Cabot
shares rose $3 to $37 a share Monday on the New York Stock
Exchange. With some 27 million common shares outstanding, Cabot had
a market value of about $999 million based on Monday's closing
price.
   A GAF spokesman told the Wall Street Journal over the weekend
that ``we have no comment whatsoever with regard to Cabot's
mean-spirited response to our company's filing.''
   GAF first disclosed its stake in Cabot in 1986, according to a
company spokesman.

   Stock prices dipped in morning trading Tuesday on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange, while the U.S. dollar inched up against
the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, the exchange's
main index, declined 114.09 points to 27,787.20 by the close of
morning trading.
   The dollar, which opened at 133.20 yen, up from 132.95 yen at
Monday's close, was changing hands at 133.13 yen in late morning
trading.
   Securities dealers said the decline in the Tokyo stock market
primarily was due to a 33-point decline overnight in the Dow Jones
industrial average in New York.
   ``In very thin trading, share prices are lower across the
board,'' said a dealer at a major Tokyo securities firm. ``This is
because of unfavorable factors in New York and the U.S. trade
report scheduled to come out soon.''
   Dealers also said they expect no major market shifts until the
release of the U.S. trade report for June, scheduled for later
Tuesday in Washington.
